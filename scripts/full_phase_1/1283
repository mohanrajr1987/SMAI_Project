Positive 1283 pI would like to become more knowledgeable in Java and thus want to learn how to go for bigger projects. p  pI already finished a project that could handle some predefined requests. For example I was able to use get some certain information from a certain website and already post some certain information to a website and to delete some certain entries. However this looks rather specific, concrete not very general. p  pI want to change this.  I want to generalize now my first success.p  pFor example I have a GUI and the GUI lets me interact with another website. As an example My GUI is made so that I can interact with my Facebook account.p  pThe ultimate step would be to generalize this to ANY website, for example my GUI interacts with a search engine like google chrome or firefox and goes into the website I want it to go into and let me interact with it.  But I guess then I would have already written myself a new browser. But well, that is the direction I want to head in and arrive maybe after one or three years. p  pHow long it would take me, depends on the resources I can go back to and learn. Therefore I would be really happy, if someone could recommend me study material to do that.  Any advice, comment or answer is appreciated. Thx in advance.     p
Positive 1283 pSo im making this mmorpg game, with a tcp protocol... bare with my english please. p  pThe problem is that when i move my packets start to delay...  Thats because, when i move i press the up button, the game is running at 60fps  so is sending around 60 packets per second. Now if i send at least one packet per second it wont have any noticeable delay...p  pSo i did implement client side prediction like gabriel explained here... a hrefhttpwww.gabrielgambetta.comfastpacedmultiplayer.html relnofollowhttpwww.gabrielgambetta.comfastpacedmultiplayer.htmlap  pthat fixed my moving, still client is sending around 60 packets per second, so lets say i move up up up up up up and then i send a different kind of packet that can NOT be predicted, lets say for chatting, I write done moving up by the time the client have recieved all the moving packets and at the end recieve the chatPacket its too dam late. Now if i dont move and i send a chatPacket it will come back almost instant.p  pSo the problem is that im sending to much data to the serverp  pI guess my question is...p  pHow can reduce the packets being send to the server when moving and still predict the server.p  pSo i thought p  precodegt send 1 move packet only when the player is at a multiple of 32 each tile is 32x32 gt start moving the player toward the direction  gt the server move the player 32pixels  gt the client recieve the response and  move toward the position the server indicated. codepre  pNow i can think ways the users might abuse this fault. Any brighter ideap  pIf you did not understand please feel free to ask, english is not my main language. Thank you for your time.p  pPS when the player move i want the player to end up 32 pixels further always..so that he always end up in a tilep

Positive 1283 pI bought a Netgear Nighthawk 8000.  I am quite impressed with the router. One of the major reasons I bought the router was for VPN services.  While going through the install I was a little upset that it did not support Android.  Finally, I found the answer and used the OpenVPN Client found an article a hrefhttpmrrobwad.blogspot.com201503connectingtonetgearnighthawkvpnwithandroid.html relnofollowLINK TO ARTICLEa that walks you through how to setup the OpenVPN Client software to work.  I successfully connected my Android phone to the VPN.  I turned off the wifi and used my carrier signal to verify and I was a node on the network.  Everything worked correctly.  Then I connected my tablet and it worked correctly by performing the same test.  I was able to see my servers and reach all the local machines in my network.  At work, when I connect my phone it works as expected and I can see all the machines on my network at home.  However, when I connect my tablet it doesnt see any the local machines.  So I tried logging in to the Router by IPAddress in the browser Like I normally do.  Instead of giving me a login to my router it is the local router here at work My router identifies as Nighthawk... etc... the router at work identifies as WRDTsomething or other..  So for some reason I can get my phone to login and become a node on my network but when I use my tablet, it will connect but will not become a node on my network.  I have to believe this is a configuration problem on the tablet, however, EVERYWHERE else I use the VPN the tablet works as expected.  Mildly frustrating...  The only configuration in the article was the routegateway custom option and I have verified it exists in both the phone and tablet.  Phone is a Samsung Galaxy S5 and tablet is a Samsung Galaxy 4.  Any kind of direction on where to start checking stuff would be greatly appreciated.p
Positive 1283 pIm trying to make a client remote for a java program, Ive read about sockets but there seems to have several protocols and ways of doing that.p  pBasically Id just want to be able to push button on the client part of the application and activate related functions on the server part, in local.p  pI guess I should be listening to a socket in a separate thread and transferread strings to know what was pushed its mostly for learning purpose.p  pId like some advicequick explanation to know how to achieve this, Ive seen examples of basic client sever communication but I didnt find anything really clear on how this should be done new thread or not and clearly I seem to not fully understand the concept of inputstreamoutputstream. thanks in advance.p

Positive 1283 pHeres the situation I need an upload form that uploads a file to an FTP server. The FTP server is not a web server its a windows machine in our server room. I have another web server HostGator that hosts our website and web apps. p  pRight now it works if I first upload the file to the web server using a hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUpload relnofollowhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploada which works very well then when the upload is complete have PHP send it to the FTP server.

Positive 1283 pI am developing webpage which will ask user to upload images.This uploaded images will be verified at server side by PHP. I am more concerned about how should verify it at client side.

If anyone changes extension of file such as file.exe to file.jpeg then executable file will considered as jpeg. What will be the solution for this sort of scenariop
Positive 1283 pIm trying to learn how to write a clientserver application to transfer files to and from a server using SSL.  Ive mostly figured out the client side using cURL andor OpenSSL in C, but Im stumped on the server side...  I have experience using Perl and other cgibin type scripts but I havent been able to find any tutorials on how to actually receive the data on the server side, only about the certificates and the authentication. Any help would be most appreciatedp
Positive 1283 pSo I have a Java Client server application. When I am trying to send a single file to the server using SSLSockets it works fine because the connection is closed straight after the byte array of the file is sent. Although, as soon as I try to send a second file inputStream reader loop hangs probably receives more bytes after the transfer IDK. I ll write the block of code slightly modified so the structures are visible underneath.p  blockquote   pclientp blockquote  precodeOutputStream  sslsocket.getOutputStream  public void sendFilePath pathOfFile     byte[] bytesToSend  Files.readAllBytespathOfFile     out.writebytesToSend     out.flush  codepre  blockquote   pserverp blockquote  precodepublic void receiverFile file     InputStream in  sslsocket.getInputStream      byte[] fileBytes  new byte[sslsocket.getReceiveBufferSize]     int temp  0     while temp  in.readfileBytes gt 0   stalls after a couple of reads         file.writefileBytes , 0, temp       codepre  pso if I close the connection straight after the codesendFilecode method everything works fine. But if I even run the client on debug and breakpoint straight after the codesendFilecode method the server just freezes on the codereadcode method of the codewhilecode loop. What is going onp

Positive 1283 pI am writing a client server program and it is my idea to have the server as simple as possible.  The server will need to complete tasks such as move this file, delete a file , run this complex algorithm on the columns in a file and send back results.p  pI have created an abstract class that will be sent between server and client called aTodo There is one method called DoClass in this abstract class that is to be run by the server.p  pCurrently my server listens and waits for a connection.  When it receives a connection it creates an object of type aTodo via unserialization.  Then the server runs the DoClass function in that object.  The server then serializes the object and sends it back to the client. here is the code for referencep  precodeprotocolBaseServer pBasenewSockFd create socket stduniqueptrltaTodogt DoThis create object variable DoThisprotocolComReadltaTodogtpBase read the stream into the variable  DoThisgtDoClasscall the do function in the  protocolComWriteDoThis,pBasewrite back to the client codepre  pIs this a good way to program a server It is VERY simple on the server. p  pAnother way I was thinking was to create a delegate class that would be serialized and sent back and forth. The delegate would have a DoDelegate method. Then the user could put ANY function into the delegates DoDelegate method.  This would in affect allow the server to run any method in a class rather than just the Single DoClass method I have the server run now.p  pThanksp

Positive 1283 pI am making a clientserver socket program where the client can send a hostname request and the server returns the IP address of the hostname.

Something likep  ptableproducts with columns productid, productname, productcost. tableproductsx with column productregisterid. tableproductsy with column productzipareaid.p  pAnd the querys would returnp  p1. select  from tableproducts where productregisterid  001 productid, productname, productcost, productregisterid 1, iphone, 599, 001.p  p2. select  from tableproducts where productzipareaid  000000110 productid, productname, productcost, productzipareaid 1, iphone, 599, 000000110.p  pSo, im accepting different suggestions for solving our problem.

Negative 1283 pIve got an project management web application where any Project can be the child of zero or one other Project.  Our director uses this function to group projects into Service Offerings, and our project managers use this to break projects down into tasks... but from the databases point of view, theyre all in the Projects table.  So the hierarchy can be arbitrarily deep, although in practice it hasnt gone deeper than 4 levels yet.p  pWhen youre looking at one projects detail page, I want to have some kind of interactive widget  that summarizes the whole family into the tightest space possible when youre not interacting with it, but expands gracefully to show as much detail as necessary to navigate around.  I think the way file folders are displayed in Windows Explorer is a pretty good metaphor, and I know how to implement that with the YUI TreeView library.p  pThe problem case, I expect, is going to be when Im looking at one project with dozens of siblings and dozens of children.  If I build the whole tree, then expand it enough to show the Project Im looking at, its also going to have expanded all my siblings, even though it could hide my children.p  pCan anyone point me to an interface example that looks like You are Here. Children exist, click this affordance to show them.  You have a parent, click that affordance to show it.   JavaScript required is ok, Flash would be less popular so it would have to be darn cool. p

Negative 1283 pI am working through some of the exercises in The C Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup.  I am confused by problem 11 at the end of Chapter 12p  blockquote5 Design and implement a library for writing eventdriven simulations.  Hint lttask.hgt.  ... An object of class task should be able to save its state and to have that state restored so that it can operate as a coroutine.  Specific tasks can be defined as objects of classes derived from task.  The program to be executed by a task might be defined as a virtual function.  ... There should be a scheduler implementing a concept of virtual time. ... The tasks will need to communicate.  Design a class queue for that.  ...blockquote  pI am not sure exactly what this is asking for.  Is a task a separate thread  As far as I know it is not possible to create a new thread without system calls, and since this is a book about C I do not believe that is the intent.  Without interrupts, how is it possible to start and stop a running function  I assume this would involve busy waiting which is to say, continually loop and check a condition although I cannot see how that could be applied to a function that might not terminate for some time if it contains an infinite loop, for example.p  pstrongEDITstrong Please see my post below with more information.p

Negative 1283 pJust recently I came over an idea called the strongApplication Strangler Patternstrong. As I understand it it is a solution to the problem with large legacy systems. The idea is to create a new application emaroundem the old application. The cost and risk of this will be much less than a complete rewrite of the system. Slowly, over time, the new application will do more and more of the work and eventually strangle the old legacy application. In the mean time developers get to work in a clean, new system with higher efficiency and hopefully producing much better code.p  pWhere I work now we have come to the point were new functionality, even seemingly trivial things, takes a long time to develop, with a high risk of breaking something. We sit on about a million lines of code, with unit test coverage of perhaps 12. The system is a SOA system using web services neither is really necessary and is more procedural in style than object oriented. The system is both web amp win, all written in .net programming languages.p  pstrongFinally the questionstrong In considering this new ideapattern, I want to know if anyone has had any experience with using this pattern they would like to share. For example, what would be a good way of implementing it hooking up to events from the old application, for example Also, if anyone has any thoughts on the subject, why it would be a good or bad idea, that would be appreciated as well.p  pstrongReferencesstrongp  ul lia hrefhttpmartinfowler.comblikiStranglerApplication.htmlMartin Fowler blog postali lia hrefhttpwww.hanselman.comblogHanselminutesPodcast165WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCodeWithMichaelFeathers.aspxHanselminutes with Michael Feathersali ul

Negative 1283 pI am working on an application which sends an AJAX POST request Im using jQuery currently every 1500ms. I have noticed that most of the times, these requests succeed within 350450ms and are sent to the server nicely in the same order as they are generated. p  pHowever sometimes, one or two requests take nearly 34 seconds and they are delivered later. In my application I need to ensure that these requests are received by the server in the same order as they are sent from the client. How do I do that I am using currently setInterval of 1500ms to call a function which generates the data to be posted and which POSTs it using .ajax. However, how do I serialise the requestsp

Negative 1283 pI have a MS SQL database with a table that stores geocoded PICKUP locations which I eventually may or may not want to display depending on search filters the user selects. These are not static like a brick and mortar store locations. They are added by the applications users 24 hrs a day. The life of a LOAD is less than 24 Hrs. Once it has been picked up, the load is removed from the table. A LOAD is defined in the table with some basic demographic details along with specific LAT and LONG.p  pI am planning on using OpenStreetMaps to provide my base maps and also my interstateroadway information. I am planning to use OpenLayers to display the map in my web App.p  pTruck Drivers refer to major interstates often as Shipping Lanes. So I would like for my users to be able to search for LOADS that are that going be along the SHIPPING LANE they are going to be traveling. For example, I95.p  pSo if a user selects the I95 Shipping Lane as a search filter, I only want the map to display LOADS that meet the following criteriap  ol liThe LOAD is along the shipping lane defined.li liThe LOAD is within a specific proximity of the shipping lane for example, the load is located 3 miles off of I95 in Richmond, VA. Ideally this would be based off of an actual interstate exit not just randomly along the highway somewhere.li ol  pAll this leads me to 2 questions....p  pQ1 When a user posts a LOAD to the database, how bounce the LAT and LONG off something to determine what Shipping Lanes could be more than depending where interstates cross each other it is along this could also be done at the time of searching but I think it would save processing to define this ahead of time unless it can not be done that way.p  pQ2 How can I tell if the LOAD is located X miles off of a given Shipping Lanep

Negative 1283 pI am developing a library for Android applications which does not use native code JNI. I have tried suppling the library as an external jar in my Android projects but this method does not include the library contents in the apk and thus throws class not found errors when run in the emulator or device. I have also tried creating the library as an Android project in itself and this does work, but only for public static properties not methods. With the library and application both being in separate apks I can see that the VM notices references to the library and can read some properties, but when an attempt to instantiate a class in the library is executed I get class not found even though I can read the public static properties from it very frustrating. p  pI realize that Davlik byte code is not the same as Java byte code but I am having trouble even finding good information about how to solve what would seem to be a very simple issue in Android. I am looking into the old PlatformLibrary stuff right now but I am not convinced this will work either since the sample has been removed from the Android site p  pSo help me out if you can, if I find the answer before this happens I will share it.p  pviva la Androidp

Negative 1283 pI have a code that runs on an embedded system and it has to run really fast. I know C and macros, and this particular project is coded mostly in C but it also uses C templates [increasingly more]. There is an inline functionp  precodeinline myt readmemoryuint32 addr    if CURRENTSTATE amp OPTIMIZEBITMAP     return readOptimizedaddr   else     return MEMORY[addr]   endif  codepre  pThis function reads from memory in an optimized fashion or conventional fashion based on the current state and a bitmap that tells whether to use optimization in a specific state or not.p  precodedefine STATEA 0x0001 define STATEB 0x0010 define STATEC 0x0100 define STATED 0x1000  define OPTIMIZEBITMAP 0x1010  optimize states d and b codepre  pand during the course of execution ok, compilation, I tried to redefine CURRENTSTATE like sop  precodeint main   define CURRENTSTATE STATEA   doa   undef CURRENTSTATE   define CURRENTSTATE STATEB   dob   ....  codepre  pAll doX functions make readmemory calls. I could not make this approach work. The value of current state is always STATEA as I can see when I use warning statements. This is not my question, although if you can help me with this Ill be double happy. So, my question is, is there a way to do this kind of thing using templates instead of macrosp  pSome more info I have to use an inline function because I cannot export MEMORY[] and this is a library function. I really prefer not to modify the function prototype like readmemory... but it will do. Also, pardon my obscurity.p  pmany thanks,p

The end game is that this txt creates a request that initiates a workflow. p  pNow, I dont yet have a full requirements spec other than the fact that we will have to use a mobile to initiate the workflow as access to the internet will not always be guaranteed we are operating in some of the most remote and hostile environments on old mother earth.p  pHas anyone used any sms service that is both simple and inexpensive and more importantly, isnt tied to a contract that involves requiring 000s of txts per month this will at most have 1020 txts per day, so not a money spinner for the mobilegateway owner.p  pWe will be implementing the domain side in .net and are comfortable in that technology. So whether the http message is xmljson or simple querystring parameters, were not concerned. The main concern is that we have recommendations for a robust service gateway that receives messages and runs the http command in any format that we specify. p  pLooking fwd to suggestions and thoughts.p  pstrong[update]strong  our preferred service provider would be UK based as the operation would be very much driven by UK daylight hoursp

What I need to figure out how to get that popup to display only when there is new content added to the database.  Thanks for the helpp  pI should also add... if anyone has any tutorials, or code snippets to share about the ajax  jquery integration with sql thatd be great. Im pretty decent at PHP but totally new to ajax and jquery p

I accidentally left them out when I simplified my code for posting.p  pEssentially, I want to accumulate some data, processing it in batches.  As I am accumulating, if I get 10 items OR it has been 1 second since I last processed the data, I will process what I have so far and clear my list.p  pSince Timer is Disposable, I have implemented the Disposable pattern on my class.  My question is this Do I need extra protection in either Dispose method to prevent any side effects of the timer event firingp  pI could easily disable the timer in either or both Dispose methods.  I understand that this would not necesarily make me 100 safe as the timer could fire between the time that Dispose is called and the timer is disabled.  Leaving that issue aside for the moment, would it be considered a best practice to guard the Dispose methods, to the best of my ability, against the possibility of the timer executingp  pNow that I think about it, I should probably also consider what I should do if the List is not empty in Dispose.  In the usage pattern of the object is emshouldem be empty by then, but I guess that anything is possible.  Lets say that there were items left in the List when Dispose is called, would it be good or bad to go ahead and try to process them  I suppose that I could put in this trusty old commentp  precodepublic void Dispose    if ints  null ampamp ints.Count gt 0        Should never get here.  Famous last words     codepre  pWhether or not there are any items in the list is secondary.  I am really only interested in finding out what the best practice is for dealing with potentially enabled Timers and Dispose.p  pIf it matters, this code is actually in a Silverlight class library.  It does not interact with the UI at all.p  pEDITp  pI found what looks like a pretty good solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1699543cstoppingtimerinitscallbackmethodherea.  One answer, by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers55952jswjswa, suggests protecting the OnTimer event with Monitor.TryEnterMonitor.Exit, effectively putting the OnTimer code in a critical section.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers12711michaelburrMichael Burra posted what seems to be an even better solution, at least for my situation, of using a oneshot timer by setting the due time to the desired interval and setting the period to Timeout.Infinite.p  pFor my work, I only want the timer to fire if at least one item has been added to the List.  So, to begin with, my timer is disabled.  Upon entering Add, disable the timer so that it does not fire during the Add.  When an item is added, process the list if necessary. Before leaving Add, if there are any items in the list i.e. if the list has not been processed, enable the timer with the due time set to the emremaining intervalem and the period set to Timeout.Infinite.p  pWith a oneshot timer, it is not even necessary to disable the timer in the OnTimer event since the timer will not fire again anyway.  I also dont have to enable the timer when I leave OnTimer as there will not be any items in the list.  I will wait until another item is added to the list before enabling the oneshot timer again. Thanksp  pEDIT  I think that this is the final version.  It uses a oneshot timer.  The timer is enabled when the list goes from zero members to one member.  If we hit the count threshold in Add, the items are processed and the timer is disabled.  Access to the list of items is guarded by a lock.  I am on the fence as to whether a oneshot timer buys me much over a normal timer other than that it will only fire when there are items in the list and only 1 second after the first item was added.  If I use a normal timer, then this sequence could happen  Add 11 items in rapid succession.  Adding the 11th causes the items to be processed and removed from the list.  Assume 0.5 seconds is left on the timer.  Add 1 more item.  Time will fire in approx 0.5 seconds and the one item will be processed and removed.  With oneshot timer the timer is reenabled when the 1 item is added and will not fire until a full 1 second interval more or less has elasped.  Does it matter  Probably not.  Anyway, here is a version that I think is reasonably safe and does what I want it to do.p  precodeusing System.Threading  public class MyClass  IDisposable    private Listltintgt ints  new Listltintgt    private Timer t    public MyClass        Create timer in disabled state      t  new Timerthis.OnTimer, null, Timeout.Infinite, Timeout.Infinite       private void DisableTimer        if t  null return      t.ChangeTimeout.Infinite, Timeout.Infinite       private void EnableTimer         if t  null return      Fire event in 1 second but no events thereafter.

Negative 1283 pIve written about this a few times, but am still having difficulty seeing how to work with manytomany relationships in MVC2 with EF4, specifically when it comes to Create and Edit functionality.

Ive found out that you need to bind the JS validation function emafterem the Facebox has opened or it doesnt work. The basis for doing that is laid out with in the Facebox documentation and should go something like this codedocument.bindreveal.facebox, function  ...stuff to do after the facebox and contents are revealed... code.  As mentioned below, I didnt think this should be the case as I thought Facebox only showed a hidden element encased in the Facebox CSS parameters but it definitely needs to be bound to the event handler only when the Facebox is opened.p  pWell it turns out I just cannot get it to work except in Firefox which meant debugging with Firebug was a bit of a no go  you can put any old gumpf into the email form and submit it and it happily sends a confirmation to asdsdf or whatever I typed in at the time.p  pThe code is below, Id really appreciate emanyem help on thisp  pThanks for your time.p  pRichp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmllangen langengt  ltheadgt      lttitlegtTrack downloadlttitlegt      ltmeta nameimageBackground contentimagesbackground.jpg gt      ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefresetmin.css gt      ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hreffacebox.css gt      ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.css gt      ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsfacebox.jsgtltscriptgt       ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      document.readyfunction          a[relfacebox].facebox              ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      function validateForm                var xdocument.forms[emailForm][emailAddress].value         var atposx.indexOf         var dotposx.lastIndexOf.         if atposlt1  dotposltatpos2  dotpos2gtx.length             alertNot a valid email address             return false                    ltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt      ltdiv idwrappergt          lth1gtGorgeous Georgelth1gtltbr gt          lth2gtlta hrefuser relfaceboxgtDownloadltagt our new tracklth2gtltbr gtltbr gt          ltpgtFollow us on lta hrefhttpgorgeousgeorgetheband.tumblr.com targetblankgtTumblrltagtltpgt          ltpgtFollow us on lta hrefhttpsoundcloud.comgorgeousgeorgetheband targetblankgtSoundcloudltagtltpgt               ltdiv idusergt                  ltform actionindex.php methodpost nameemailForm onsubmitreturn validateFormgt                  ltfieldsetgt                      lth3 classblackgtEmail Addresslth3gtltbr gt                      ltinput idemailAddress idemailForm nameemailAddress onfocusthis.value  ampquotEnter Email Addressampquot  this.value  ampquotampquot  this.value size30 typetext valueEnter Email Address width28 gtltbr gt                      ltinput typesubmit valueSubmit gt                      ltfieldsetgt                  ltformgt              ltdivgt        ltimg srcimagesgorgeousGeorge.jpg altGorgeous George classmainImage gt      ltdivgt  ltbodygt  lthtmlgt  codepre

Negative 1283 pIve been doing a lot of ObjectiveC programming lately, and now that Im coming back to PHP, I have to be honest, I miss the named parameters at first I hated them, now I love them, go figure.p  pAnyway, in PHP, I sometimes see people passing arrays to functions as a pseudo way of naming parameters with the added benefit of not having to worry about the order, but sometimes that makes function writing overcomplicated. Also, sometimes I want to call the function with named parameters, but sometimes its easier and faster not to.p  pDoes anyone simply do something like thisp  precodefunction calculateArea width, height        do calculations here...    and then call the function like so calculateArea width  10, height  5  codepre  pIt seems to work fine, at least with my version of PHP, and Im wondering if other people use this technique as a workaround for named parameters as well. Im also wondering if anyone knows of some compelling reasons why I shouldnt be doing this.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks for all the quick responses everyone. To make things more clear, let me just say that I understand that passing an associative array is a better option in most scenarios, but sometimes youre working with functions that youve already written and you dont want to change how their called in every single part of your code. Also sometimes youre working with a secondary framework and you dont have any control over how the function was written.p  pIf Im looking at code I wrote a year ago and I see codeecho zcgtexpandFoo, Bar, 10, 1, 0, null, null, arrayclassgtcode, falsecode, thats not very helpful.p  pSo, to reword my question, Im basically asking thisbr strongSometimes passing arguments to a function via assignment is easier to read. What are the downsides of doing this, and will it work in all versions of PHPstrongp

Negative 1283 pIm writing a new c desktop application that is going to allow users to select a group of image files that the application requires to remember. I also have some other settings to save that I was going to save as an xml file along with the files they specify. I was thinking of trying to save the files together in a zipcab type file or something similar, sort of like a .war or .docx file. That way when the user comes back, they can select their file and have everything they need. This way users wouldnt be able to easily delete a needed file. Cons would be the file could get rather large, especially since it could contain image files. p  pBut, then I was thinking of how visual studio stores things in their project files .cproj which is a pointer to specific files in a folder. This seems like a good solution also. Going this route, Id have to add some more error checking to make sure the user didnt delete a file. Im not sure if this would out way the code needed to zipunzip the files though.p  pAny pointers on which way would be better Any proscons to either methodp

Negative 1283 pIm writing an Android app which sometimes needs to request data through HTTP from a REST API. Im using the Apache DefaultHttpClient for performing requests. Is there a way to write tests for this app and replace DefaultHttpClients response when running the tests so that test results are always consistentp  pAs an example of the things Id like to test, one of the web services Im accessing takes a string and performs a text search, returning a paged list of objects. I need to test the cases where the list is empty, the list fits in the first page, or the list is larger than a page and the app needs to make several requests to get the complete list.p  pIm not the developer of this web API nor can modify its responses, so I cant change what it returns. For the above example, if I want to test the case where the list returned is empty, I could just search for a string which Im sure wont return any results, but the other two cases are harder because what the service can return is always changing.p  pI think ideally I would have a way to get a modified DefaultHttpClient when running tests, that returns a hardcoded result for requests to a given URL instead of actually doing the network request. This way I would always get consistent results independently of the real web services response.p  pIm currently using Robotium for testing but Im open to using other tools too.p

Events are comprised of a name, datetime, running length and a codeRoomcodep  pA codeRoomcode is chosen from a select list when the event is created, all Rooms are created beforehand through seeding or admin interface. Room will store information like seating count.p  pIve been trying to find a method implementing this that feels right. Solutions seem to range between habtm or hasmany through but I cant see the need for a join table for this situation. Theoretically, an Event codehasone roomcode but the reverse relationship isnt codebelongsto eventcode as a Room may be used for many events, this also requires the foreign key to be on the rooms table.p  pIve considered handling this manually in the model using a roomid foreign key in the event, I could then query for the relevant Room. I think this would work since I currently cannot see a requirement for finding all events using a Room.p  precodeclass Event lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto schedule    def room     Room.findroomid   end end codepre  pEverything Ive done so far in Rails has felt right, but all the solutions Ive come up with here doesnt and I feel like Im missing something or maybe Im just expecting that extra bit of magic. Is there a Rails way to do thisp

Negative 1283 pI know that it is done by signing assembly with private key.p  pSo here how I see the process ... When we have the privatepublic key pair file we can build assembly signing it using this keys. So what in reallity is done is that compiler opens the skor pfx file and retreives the private key which I understand is impossible for human and after signing the assembly with the private key it adds the public key into assembly manifest and that is it I have the strongly named assembly.p  pSo what when I run the application which is referencing that assemly  What does CLR to be sure that the assebly is not replaced and nothing was changedp

Negative 1283 pIm building an Android application that will be like an eBook.  Standard flip through pages, view images, etc.  One of the requirements is that in multiple places you will see a preview of what a page will look like.  Itll be the exact contents of that page, just in a smaller size.p  pI cant for the life of me get this preview working the way I need it to.  I coded an activity which will display either controls to play audio or video depending on some values passed in the extras.  That works fine.  The preview should be this activity, but only in a smaller size, and shown in a separate activity.  Heres what Ive tried to get a smaller version of the activity to showp  pFirst, I stumbled across the poorly documented ActivityGroup object.  I figured I could use this to call the activity, and then get the view and throw it into a parent view somehow.  Heres what that code looked likep  precodepublic class GroupTest extends ActivityGroup    Called when the activity is first created.  Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.grouptest      LocalActivityManager manager  getLocalActivityManager      Intent intent  new Intent     intent.setClassgetBaseContext, ViewElement.class     intent.putExtraElementID, 22     intent.putExtraPackID, 10     Window w  manager.startActivityvideoelement, intent     View v  w.getDecorView       Grab the table and add a view to it.

The activity ViewElement was indeed displaying in the GroupTest activity.  The problem was that whenever I tried to add something else to the table like a label, the ViewElement activity would disappear.  I tinkered with this for a while figuring I was failing to grasp some UI constraint, then realized that the ViewElement activity being displayed had clickable buttons, which isnt what I really want.  I just want to see what that page looks like, not be able to interact with it.p  pSo I tried a different approach.  Found this page on saving a view to an image a hrefhttpjtribe.blogspot.com200812savingviewasimagewithandroid.html relnofollowhttpjtribe.blogspot.com200812savingviewasimagewithandroid.htmla.

As far as I can tell calling w.getDecorView doesnt return a view that actually has any height, width, or drawn properties on it.  If I run that code I get the error width and height must be  0  And if I put in values for width and height, nothing shows but a black image.  So I then proceeded to create simple things such as a TextView and draw it to the bitmap to display in my LinearLayout, but could never get it working right either.  Im to the point of just being completely fed up with manipulating UI in Android.p  pSo, has anyone else does something similar with previewing what another activity would look like, and how did you accomplish it  Am I just going down the completely wrong path here  Ive googled all over the place and part of me feels like someone has to have solved this problem before, but Ive lost over a day of work on it and I just cant pour much more time into it right now.p  pThanks for any help.p

How do others deal with this Are there any clear example that walk through this issuep  pAnother issue that comes up is that Id rather not need a codesetIdcode method since Hibernate is managing all of the ids. From what I have been able to determine, the Spring MVC model binder can only bind a field if it has the expected getter and setter. Is there some other way to apply the new state, such as getting the current User from the db by the URLs codeidcode parameter and then applying the new state to it, but without having to explicitly code all of the field copiesp  pI am sure there is a fairly simple, straightforward way to handle this, but my heataddled brain does not seem to be able to come up with a suitable solution.p  pIm fairly new to Spring  Hibernate so forgive me if this is one of those mundane, highly covered topics, but I have not been able to find any clear example that covers my very simple situation.

Negative 1283 pI am working on an Android game that has background movement using a display group called scene. I added a platform to the group. When I cause an object to collide with the platform, it works just fine, but I find that there is also an invisible platform created adjacent to the visible platform. It has to do with the moveCamera function. The following snippets of code are the heart of the problem. If I delete the moveCamera function, everything works great, but I need the scene to move. Any advice is appreciated.p  precodeplatform  display.newImage platform.png, 100, 100 physics.addBody platform, static, borderBodyElement  platform.name  platform sceneinsertplatform   Camera follows cat automatically local function moveCamera     if cat.x gt 80 and cat.x lt 1100 then         scene.x  cat.x  80     end end codepre

Negative 1283 pMy iOS application uses codeCoreDatacode to store many things, and codeNSUserDefaultscode to store other things that codeCoreDatacode would be overkill for.p  pIm going to simplify this so bear with me Note for the sake of this example lets use credit cards.

We add another card and assign it 2. Another... 3. We can set a default card that will be highlighted on launch by tapping it. What it does is saves the codecardNumcode as the codecDefaultcode to codeNSUserDefaultscode to keep track of it effectively setting card X as the default card. p  pcrude drawing of a table viewp  precodecDefault is 2  1  Card1  2  Card2 cDefault  3  Card3  4  Card4  codepre  pSo lets say we assign codecDefaultcode to 2 and then next week we delete that card.

As you can see in the screen shots below, the first directions are created with just an Origin and Destination and avoid types, and the second one is purely created on passing each waypoint that was saved.brp  pIve confirmed that the waypoints that come back from the initial request are the exact same as the waypoints Im saving and passing back to BING.  brp  pHere are some live queries that I used for the screens belowbr a hrefhttpdev.virtualearth.netRESTv1RoutesDrivingwp.040.797768,111.947299ampwp.140.793368,111.943672ampwp.240.7934,111.939231ampwp.340.725911,111.939ampwp.440.725589,111.911137ampwp.540.72546,111.888247ampwp.640.725439,111.87122ampwp.740.6657,111.864848ampwp.840.63854,111.834571ampwp.940.637478,111.808838ampwp.1040.619352,111.789488ampwp.1140.633739,111.723919ampwp.1240.631808,111.71923ampoptmztimeamprpoPointsamptl3.0E6ampduMile relnofollowMy generated link to BING RESTabr a hrefhttpwww.bing.commapsv2ampcp40.70858203667544111.83644562959671amplvl11ampdir0ampstyramprtppos.40.797768111.94729940.797768,20111.947299epos.40.793368111.94367240.793368,20111.943672epos.40.7934111.93923140.7934,20111.939231epos.40.725911111.93940.725911,20111.939epos.40.725589111.91113740.725589,20111.911137epos.40.72546111.88824740.72546,20111.888247epos.40.725439111.8712240.725439,20111.87122epos.40.6657111.86484840.6657,20111.864848epos.40.63854111.83457140.63854,20111.834571epos.40.637478111.80883840.637478,20111.808838epos.40.619352111.78948840.619352,20111.789488epos.40.633739111.72391940.633739,20111.723919epos.40.631808111.7192340.631808,20111.71923eampmodeDamprtop000ampformLMLTCC relnofollowQuery with each waypointabrp  pAny ideas as to what is going on or what I can do to fix this Its like BING wants to further optimize the route, but ends up making it worse.

Negative 1283 pI have a problem concerning the reading of the stdout in python. I have to explain a bit what I am trying to do.p  pI have a Python program emfooem this calls a second python program embarem. embarem will give back to stdout status details and other information to be logged. The emfooem now has to read this. In principle it works. I can grab the output of embarem and send it to a log file without any problems. The problems start when I try to look for certain phrases in the output from embarem the status report. p  pI am reading the output with strongos.readfn, nstrong from the stdout of embarem. The problem is that strongos.readstrong reads n bytes, but not a line it can be more or less. I want it to read every line that is written to stdout by embarem, these lines end with n and are written either with strongprintstrong or with strongsys.stdout.writestrong followed by a strongsys.stdout.flushstrong.p  pemfooem calls embarem usingp  precodebar subprocess.Popenargs, stdinsubprocess.PIPE, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE fdin[0]  bar.stdout.fileno fdin[1]  bar.stderr.fileno codepre  pMy code looks like this at the moment. embarem writesp  precodeprint TAG INFO1 INFO2 INFO3 or sys.stdout.writeTAG INFO1 INFO2 INFO3n sys.stdout.flush codepre  pI am reading in emfooem withp  precodebuf  os.readfdin[0], 256 codepre  pWhen I write this to a log file withp  precodeintlogFile.writebuf intlogFile.flush codepre  peverything is fine. But if I want to grab the first word of the output line like thisp  precodetokens  buf.stripn.split  codepre  pI end up in missery, because I do not get TAG, but I might have INFOx or something from a previous output nothing to do with my status messages.p  pSo to sum it up I need to read the output of embarem line by line in emfooem.

Anyway I want to use custom paging in database.p  pI have a stored proc called codeGetUsersPagedcode like belowp  precodeALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetUsersPaged]  startRowIndex int, maximumRows int, name nvarchar300  NULL, email nvarchar100  NULL AS BEGIN     SELECT      FROM           SELECT ,             ROWNUMBER OVERORDER BY Id AS RowRank             FROM UserInfo             WHERE          Nickname LIKE name           OR FirstName LIKE name           OR LastName LIKE name           OR name IS NULL              AND          Email  email OR email IS NULL       AS UsersPagedList     WHERE RowRank BETWEEN startRowIndex AND startRowIndex  maximumRows  END codepre  pand codeGetUsersCountcode stored proc like belowp  precode    ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetUsersCount]      name nvarchar300  NULL,     email nvarchar100  NULL     AS     BEGIN    SELECT COUNT        FROM UserInfo        WHERE      Nickname LIKE name       OR FirstName LIKE name       OR LastName LIKE name       OR name IS NULL          AND      Email  email OR email IS NULL    END codepre  pNow I have two methods for calling these stored procs like belowp  precode    [DataObjectMethodDataObjectMethodType.Select, false]     public ListltDAL.UserInfogt GetPagedUserSearchResultsint startRowIndex, int pageSize, string name, string email              DBService dbService  new DBService         var db  dbService.GetDatabase         var list  new ListltDAL.UserInfogt          ifname  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             list  db.FetchltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersPaged startRowIndex  0, maximumRows  1,                                              name  2, email  3, startRowIndex, pageSize, name, email          else ifname  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             list  db.FetchltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersPaged startRowIndex  0, maximumRows  1,                                              email  2, startRowIndex, pageSize, email          else ifname  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             list  db.FetchltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersPaged startRowIndex  0, maximumRows  1,                                              name  2, startRowIndex, pageSize, name          else ifname  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             list  db.FetchltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersPaged startRowIndex  0, maximumRows  1                                             ,startRowIndex, pageSize          return list           [DataObjectMethodDataObjectMethodType.Select, false]     public int GetPagedUserSearchResultsCountstring name, string email              DBService dbService  new DBService         var db  dbService.GetDatabase         IEnumerableltDAL.UserInfogt count  null          if name  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             count  db.QueryltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersCount name  0, email  1, name, email          else if name  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             count  db.QueryltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersCount email  0, email          else ifname  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             count  db.QueryltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersCount name  0, name          else if name  string.Empty ampamp email  string.Empty             count  db.QueryltDAL.UserInfogtEXEC GetUsersCount          return count.CountltDAL.UserInfogt      codepre  pMy question is everything is fine when Im executing and testing stored procs in db inside SQL Management Studio. All results respect to paging parameters. But when I call the same stored procs using PetaPoco, it fetches the whole thing and paging is ignored. p  pFor example when I test stored procs in SQL Management Studio with p  precodestartRowIndex  0 maximumRows  1 codepre  pand I dont send anything for codenamecode and codeemailcode, it returns just one row which is totally correct. But the same things with PetaPoco, it returns 3 rows in the list. Any idea whats the problemp

Negative 1283 pPicking up a tip from someone else on this site, Ive been using logical operators to express conditional logic in list comprehension as a shortcut to using full for loops with if statements. p  pFor example, if I had a list [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] that I wanted to turn into [Yes, No, No, Yes, Yes] I could do it like thisp  precodeoriginal  [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] new  [x1 and Yes or No for x in original] codepre  pThe problem I have is that I get some very strange results when I use the logical operators with 0 in this way. The results occur regardless of whether Im using list comprehension or not.p  pThesep  precodeprintTrue and 1.0 or Wrong printTrue and 1.0 or Wrong printTrue and 1.0 or Wrong printTrue and 1 or Wrong codepre  pCorrectly I think outputp  precode1.0 1.0 1.0 1 codepre  pHowever thesep  precodeprintTrue and 0 or Wrong printTrue and 0.0 or Wrong codepre  pOutputp  precodeWrong Wrong codepre  pI think that Python is implicitly converting both 0 and 0.0 to a boolean False, and any other value of any other type to Truep  pCan someone confirm whether a. This is the case andor b. Is there a way to achieve what Im after in list comprehension another way with a lamda or somethingp  pMany thanks Chrisp

Negative 1283 pI have searched for similar questions but cannot find the right answer to my specific one. I have a column data in my table table which contains comma separated values which are ids e.g. p  ul liRow 1 4,5,45li liRow 2 5,8,9li liRow 3 5 li ul  pI use an inarray function to retrieve the number of occurances for the data value within the while loop. So I use an sql function to retrieve the number of times a certain value such as 5 occurs in all rows within the while loop. p  pThe issue is that I can only retrieve the data value if it is by itself i.e. no commas just the integer by itself so based on my example in the list, I can only retrieve 5 once row 3. I would like to retrieve the value 5 three times as it appears in all the rows. Here is my code below and any help would be appreciated. The selectiontext variable is what the user enters from the form.   p  precode sqlfrndarrymem1  mysqlquerySELECT data, id FROM table WHERE    dataselectiontext  whilerowmysqlfetcharraysqlfrndarrymem1    datacheck  row[data]  id  row[id]     frndArryMem1  explode,, frndarrymem1 if  frndarrymem1  ampamp inarrayid, frndArryMem1 echo id codepre  pThank you. p

Negative 1283 pI am working on a gem that has needs to set dependencies conditionally when the gem is installed.  Ive done some digging aroundp  pand it looks like im not alone in this need.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4596606rubygemshowdoiaddplatformspecificdependencyRubygems How do I add platformspecific dependencyap  h1this is a long threadh1  pa hrefhttpwww.rubyforum.comtopic957999httpwww.rubyforum.comtopic957999ap  pThe only way I can see to add dependencies to a gem is to use adddependency method within a GemSpecifiction block in a .gemspec filep  precodeGemSpecification.new do s     ... standard setup stuff     conditionally set dependencies   s.adddependency rbinotify, gt 0.8.8 if RUBYPLATFORM  linuxi   s.adddependency rbfsevent, gt 0.4.3.1 if RUBYPLATFORM  darwini   s.adddependency rbfchange, gt 0.0.5 if RUBYPLATFORM  mswinmingwi  end codepre  pBased on all of the docs and threads I found on the net, I would have expected that if you install the gem onp  ul liLinux, then, rbinotify would be a dependency and autoinstalledli liMac  rbfsevent would be installedli liWindows  rbfchange would be installedli ul  pHowever, it seems that is not the case.  The if statements within the block are evaluated at the time the gem is built and packaged.  Therefore, if you build and package the gem on Linux, then, rbinotify is added as a dependency, Mac, then, rbfsevent, Windows  rbfchange.p  pStill needing a solution, I dug around in the rubygems code and it seems the following is a broad stoke of what happens.p  ul libuild all of your code for your gem foo.gemli licreate a foo.gemspec fileli libuild, package, and release the gem to a gem server such as rubygems.orgli lilet everyone knowli lidevelopers install it locally via gem install fooli lithe foo.gem file is downloaded, unpacked, and installed.  all dependencies are installed as well.li lieverything should be set and we can beging using the gem.li ul  pIt seems that when the gem is built and released the foo.gemspec file is loaded and the GemSpecification block is evaluated and converted to YAML, compressed as metadata.gz, and included in foo.gem.  The ruby code is compressed into data.tar.gz and included as well.  When the gem is installed on the local developer machine, the YAML is extracted from metadata.gz and converted back into a GemSpecification block, however, it is not converted back to the original block.p  pinstead, you will see something like the followingp  precodeGemSpecification.new do s    if s.respondto specificationversion then     s.specificationversion  3      if GemVersion.newGemVERSION gt GemVersion.new1.2.0 then       s.addruntimedependencyqltrbinotifygt, [gt 0.8.8]     else       s.adddependencyqltrbinotifygt, [gt 0.8.8]     end   else     s.adddependencyqltrbinotifygt, [gt 0.8.8]   end  end codepre  pOk.  So, I have a birds eye view of the process, however, that does not change my desire to build a single gem and conditionally specify dependencies for a range of OS targets.p  pIf anyone has a solution other than building multiple .gemspec files for each target OS...  Im all earsp

Negative 1283 pIm working on an HTTP REST service implemented on WCF. Id like to set the HTTP cache control headers for my operations appropriately. p  pIve seen a few examples that involve using the codeWebOperationContext.Current.OutgoingResponsecode to modify the headers in each method. But lets be honest, thats a pain in the butt, especially since nearly all of my operations are going to use the same cache control policy nocache.p  pIm thinking there must be an elegant way to set this. Perhaps a combination of a ServiceBehavior to set a servicelevel default, and OperationBehaviors to override that for certain operations Or maybe theres some better way to do this p

Negative 1283 pThere is something I still dont quite understand about the way matrices and other multidimensional arrays are represented in C and C and how to allocate them dynamically.p  pConsider the following code segmentp  precodeint main      int n     cin gtgt n     int a[n][n]     ...  codepre  pIf I understand correctly, this allocates an n by n matrix of integers on the stack. The i,jth element of the matrix can be accessed using a[i][j]. The compiler automatically converts this into an access into the nijth element of a one dimensional array actually allocated.p  pSuppose now that I would like to allocate the n by n matrix a on the heap, instead of the stack. I can then do the followingp  precodeint main      int n     cin gtgt n     int a     a  new int[n]     for int i0iltni a[i]  new int[n]     ...  codepre  pI can now access the i,jth element again as a[i][j]. However, this is not exactly  equivalent to the situation above as I actually had to allocate space for nn ints, plus n pointers to int. Also, accessing a[i][j] now entails two accesses to memory instead of just one. On the other hand, the index computation nij is avoided.p  pSuppose now that I am interested in n by m matrices where m is small, e.g., m2. Using the array of row pointers then wastes 33 of the space. Is there any way of  avoiding thatp  pI can of course allocate a onedimensional array and do the index arithmetic myself, but this does not seem to be the best solution to me.p  pAny information would be appreciatedp

Negative 1283 pI tried asking this question a bit differently before, but it wasnt understood, so Ill try another wayp  pI have an MVC 3 application where I have views in the Views directory as usual. However, for various reasons I need the images for each view to be in the same folder as the view itself, i.e. in my case e.g. ViewsManualsenUSnamep  pHeres the route I usep  precoderoutes.MapRoute                 Parameter,                 controlleractionlangprod,                 new  controller  Manuals, action  Product, lang  enUS, prod  name           codepre  pNow, as mentioned, I need the images for this view to be in the same folder, so that the image path can simply be ATEXSymbol.svg.p  pWhen I just have this route, and use a simple relative path like this for the image, what I get is an error like thisp  blockquote   pThe view 39daDKATEXSymbol.svg39 or its master was not found or   no view engine supports the searched locations. The following   locations were searched ViewsManualsdaDKATEXSymbol.svg.aspx   ViewsManualsdaDKATEXSymbol.svg.ascx   ViewsShareddaDKATEXSymbol.svg.aspx   ViewsShareddaDKATEXSymbol.svg.ascx   ViewsManualsdaDKATEXSymbol.svg.cshtml   ViewsManualsdaDKATEXSymbol.svg.vbhtml   ViewsShareddaDKATEXSymbol.svg.cshtml   ViewsShareddaDKATEXSymbol.svg.vbhtmlp blockquote  pSo basically, its looking for the image in the correct language folder, but without the product name folder part, and with one of a number of view extensions appended. I know MVC doesnt really expect this relative path in the same folder, but I pretty much dont have any choice. Im required to put images in the same folder for purposes out of my hands.p  pSo how can I achieve thisp  pEDITp  pActually, I was mistaken a bit above, saying that the product name part of the path was missing, of course it isnt. That part of the path is the name of the view itself. So basically the path I get by a simple relative path just the name of the image file in the src attribute creates the correct path for the image. The only problem is that the view file extension is added...p  pAnyone know how to solve thisp  pEDIT 2p  pBTW, I could have used Url.Content, but for some reason that doesnt work either. If I use this p  precodeltembed  typeimagesvgxml srcUrl.ContentContentimagesdaDK3153CheckRotation.svggtltembedgt codepre  p...it works...but if I use this same thing but with the image in the Views folder...p  precodeltembed  typeimagesvgxml srcUrl.ContentViewsManualsdaDKCheckRotation.svggtltembedgt codepre  p...it doesnt work. If I inspect the path in the latter example in the web inspector, it looks like the correct path localhost49864ViewsManualsdaDKCheckRotation.svg but with the message that it cannot be found.p  pEDIT 3p  pThe answer by Thinking Sites gave me a solution, I just had to modify it a bit, since I needed the route suggested for the views themselves. So I added this routep  precoderoutes.MapRoute                 Image,                 controlleractionlangprod,                 new  controller  Manuals, action  Image, lang  enUS, prod  name           codepre  pI made a slight adjustment in the path as suggested, since the prod now actually carries the entire filename, including extensionp  precodepublic ActionResult Imagestring lang, string prod                      var root  Server.MapPathViewsManuals             var filepath  Path.Combineroot, lang, prod  whatever creates your path here.             return Filefilepath, imagesvgxml          codepre  pAnd then in the view I can have paths like thisp  precodeltembed  typeimagesvgxml srcUrl.ContentManualsImagedaDKCheckRotation.svggtltembedgt codepre

Negative 1283 pA customer has asked me to move one of their old websites which is mostly flash based to a new server.p  pThe original developer of the site many years ago made a mistake by using http127.0.0.1.... in one important link in some ActionScript. The original development company is long since gone.p  pI am able to decompile the SWF using a hrefhttpwww.sothink.comproductflashdecompiler relnofollowSothink SWF Decompilera and find and correct the offending ActionScript. However I am unable to recompile back into a SWF that works completely correctly numerous additional bugs appear, as its a complicated Flash project. Ive tried different Flash versions going back to v.6, the 4th byte of the SWF indicates it was originally v.7 MX2004, and Ive tried matching Hex bytes in recompiled output against the original to account for Tag compression etc. So far nothing has matched.p  pIt would take me a long time to fix all the additional bugs in my recompiled Flash, when all I really want to do is change one string literal in the original SWF so that the site works exactly as it was originally intended to do. Im prepared to make the string length of my new literal match the old incorrect one exactly if necessary by adding a directorysymlink on the new server linking back to the correct file.p  pIs there any way to do thisp

Negative 1283 pIn my application, I have one text field and a button. After focus lost from text field first swing worker lets assume it as sw1 is called. Which opens a popup to populate value to put in text field. Second swing worker lets assume it as sw2 is called after user clicks a button. Now the issue is that if I write something in text field and then click on button, sw1 is started first to calculate the value to put in text field and at the same time sw2 is also started. And sw2 finishes first and then sw1 populates result. What I want is sw2 should wait for sw1 to finish. Once sw1 finishes its task, it will notify sw2.

Negative 1283 pOkay, so this is starting to really annoy me. This error pops up in a very special, not very logical way.p  pLet me start out by saying that I have already looked at the other questions regarding this error, Googled it too. As far as I can tell, most similar problems occur because people refer to a codeStringcode resource or something else not within the same layout file, they misplace the  in id or something similar.p  pThe problem I am having occurs in a layout .xml file with a codeRelativeLayoutcode. This contains a codeTableLayoutcode, two codeLinearLayoutcodes containing some text and finally a codeProgressBarcode. What I want is the progress bar to be aligned with the relative layout using codeandroidlayoutalignParentBottomtruecode and then align the two linear layouts  above the progress bar the bottom linear layout aligning above the progress bar, the other aligning above the bottom linear layout.p  pIt should be simple enough and looks as if it works, i.e. the graphic view shows the desired result. However, and stronghere comes the problemstrong, Eclipse gives me an error on the two linear layouts,p  pError No resource found that matches the given name at layoutabove with value idLinearLayoutacc.p  pand the same error for the other linear layout referring to the progress bar. I have more than triple checked that there are no typos the ids also exist in packagename.R.java, and I have tried cleaning the project a dozen times.p  pI dont get the error when saving and auto building, not until I decide to run the project. Another weird thing is that when I refer to the bottom linear layout from the progress bar instead of the top linear layout, I get no errorp  pMy layout filep  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidbackgrounddrawablebackgroundactivity gt         ltTableLayout              ... gt          ltLinearLayout             androidididLinearLayoutdist             androidlayoutaboveidLinearLayoutacc             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue             androidlayoutmarginBottom10dp gt              ltTextView                 ... gt              ltTextView                 ... gt         ltLinearLayoutgt          ltLinearLayout             androidididLinearLayoutacc             androidlayoutaboveidProgressBarstatusScreen             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue gt              ltTextView                 ... gt              ltTextView                 ... gt         ltLinearLayoutgt          ltProgressBar             androidididProgressBarstatusScreen             styleandroidattrprogressBarStyleHorizontal             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue             androidlayoutmargin16dp gt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pPlease help, I have no idea what causes this errorp  h2Edit with answersh2  pShrikant came with the solution of changing the order of appearance in the layout file so that elements reference only other elements already defined when the reference is read.br Also, as others have posted, changing codeidcode to codeidcode, even in a reference, does remove the error messages. As Marco W. wrote in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5025910differencebetweenidandidinandroidthisa thread, the thing is you have to use codeidcode the first time each id is mentioned and then use codeidcode afterwards, even though the first time may not be a definition.  p  pI made most of the design and set the referred ids in Eclipses graphical editor, so code that resulted in an error message was automatically inserted. Maybe this is a bug in Eclipse.p

Negative 1283 pI want to be able to log at different levels depending on what server I deploy my Java web application on.

Is a context parameter value substitution capability available in log4j configuration Do I need to explore other options such using an external log4j.xml filep

Negative 1283 pIm experimenting with using SVG in HTML, something Im not too familiar with. Its embedded as an object in the html.p  pThe SVG is scalable through CSS. When the window is at full size i.e. large enough that the SVG is at its maximum allowed width through CSS it looks normal in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. When the browser window is small, the actual SVG image and what I assume is its container scales down appropriately in both Firefox and Chrome. However, in Safari desktop and iOS the SVG image itself scales down but its container stays at its original, maximum height. In other words theres too much space on the top and bottom of the actual image in narrow widths in Safari.p  pI currently have width, maxwidth, and maxheight values assigned via CSS. Applying a height value other than auto gives me the problem across all browsers. Ive removed the width and height values from the SVG itself to make it adjust to the browser size.p  pI want to know how to make Safari scale the SVG image in the same manner as Firefox and Chrome.

Negative 1283 pGlicko2 is a rating system used in chess, but can be used in many other situations. Glicko2 is an improvement on Glicko1, which addressed problems of the older ELO rating.p  pWhat makes Glicko2 special in comparison to version 1  is that it incorporates a higher rating deviation RD the longer someone has been inactive.

Negative 1283 pI am trying to create a filling method which takes the initial coordinate specified by the user, checks the character and then changes it as desired. After doing so, it then checks adjacent squares and repeats the process. After some research, I came across the flood fill algorithm and after trying that it works but cannot meet my maximum requirement of an array of 250 by 250 characters. p  pMy original flood fill algorithm was as followsp  precodepublic static void fillArea int x, int y, char original, char fill     if picture[y1][x1]  original       return        picture[y1][x1]  fill    fillArea x1, y, original, fill    fillArea x1, y, original, fill    fillArea x, y1, original, fill    fillArea x, y1, original, fill     return  codepre  pAfter testing, I began to try the Queue method as explained on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFloodfillAlternativeimplementations relnofollowWikipediaa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2783204floodfillusingastackthis question asked previouslya regarding a similar issue.

Negative 1283 pstrongThe Backgroundstrongp  pToday I was reflecting on the pain installOS testing. As we approach a new release of our windows software, we have to verifyp  ol liThat it installs without issueli liThat it runs, given a reasonable fulfillment of dependenciesli liThat our assumptions as to what is available on an updated machine are correctli liOn a range of architectures 3264 bit, etcli liOn a range of operating system versions Windows XP, Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc.li ol  pOur sad but usual and cost effective approach is to spin up some old boxes here on site. We either try to stuff an OS install into a VM system, or are forced to wipe the box and do a native install just to get to a clean install of the app. Depending on the functional approach, reverting snapshots may or may not be available.p  pstrongThe Ideastrongp  pI realized that Windows Azure was making it very easy to spin up virtual machines these days and pay for what you use.

Negative 1283 pThis is not homework, I am just using CodingBat Java to help learn programming. p  pI initially used a method which passed all of the sites tests, but I dont think it would work for longer arrays. The initial method used 2 loops and did not use a new array. I have created a solution which introduces a new array and a 3rd nested loop and I believe will work for all instances of the problem. However, the site states that the problems in this section can be solved with 2 loops, so I am wondering if there actually is a 2 loop solution that will work for ANY instance of the problem. Here is the question and my 3 loop solutionp  pThis is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.

Negative 1283 pIn my Azure web service I have code that invokes a stored procedure in SQL Azure. Sometimes it happens so that the stored procedure completes but the connection is broken afterwards and the caller gets a codeSqlExceptioncode claiming that codeTimeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.codep  pThe caller will then reopen the connection and try to rerun the same code. The problem is that the code first checks that the database table stores the right state and since the abovementioned stored procedure has already been run the database state has changed and so the check is failed and an exception is thrown.p  pSo the problem is the calling code relies on the condition that no exceptions equals database change okay and so if there was an exception then the database has not changed. In this case an exception is because of temporary connectivity problems after the database change has occurred so the assumption turns out to be wrong.p  pWhats the typical way to address such casesp

Negative 1283 pI have a small Google App Engine site which seems to be outgrowing it, and I want to migrate somewhere else.p  pIt is based on Java  Stripes Framework  Objectify, and only uses URLFetch from Google services. It uses 60 frontend hours and 4 GB datastore at the moment, with 5k visitors doing 25k page views per day.p  pReasons why I believe I should migratep  ul liI have made some assumptions early on which no longer are valid and am running into 1MB memcachedatastore limits. While I could refactor this it would likely increase the number of datastore operations  overall worsen performance characteristics, and involve a database conversion step which I may as well use to migrate somewhere elseli liI want to add some features which would involve a significant increase in stored data to ca 100 GB and frontend hoursli liAs Im using resources past the free quota, the increase in costs seem to rise quite fast. While they are quite manageable now, if the application becomes more popular, Im afraid it may no longer be affordable.li liSome stability issues getting some OutOfMemoryErrors and other errors that I cannot explain, and cannot replicate very well on my local environmentli ul  pIm evaluating the following optionsp  ol lipStaying on GAE, optimizing the application, living with the growing costs Cons still will be having high costs and reliability issuespli lipMoving to AWS EC2  EBS with MongoDB as a datastore Pros probably the most mature solution, Cons appears difficult to set up, easy to make architecturedesign mistakes. pli lipUsing Appscale to hopefuly largely leave my application asis, but host it on AWS EC2 Pros seems easy on paper, Cons seems to presume a largely Unix development environment, no idea if production ready or what is happening behind the scenespli lipUse CloudFoundry.com with MongoDB as a datastore Cons no idea if production ready, postbeta costs are not knownpli lipGet a VPS or a dedicated server with some hosting provider, deploy using MongoDB as a datastore Cons probably teaches me less of the things I want to learn than the other options, plenty of sysadmining to dopli ol  pIt is a hobby site, so part of the goal is to also learn some new technologies in practice, Id just want to invest my time in learning the right ones. p  pNotes  I have some, but quite limited system administration skills, especially on Linux, and I dont enjoy doing it. I have done a small project in MongoDB before never put in production though. Ive never used any of the AWS infrastructure.p  pMy questionsp  pa. Is AppScale mature enough for the purpose of running a small website without much hassles bugs, lack of documentation, etc. Is the learning curve very steep How much system administration would using it in scenario 3 require And most importantly  do I understand correctly that the Google 1MB and so forth limits are all there on AppScalep  pb. Is CloudFoundry mature enough for the purpose of running a small website without much hassles bugs, lack of documentation, etc. Is the learning curve very steep How much system administration would using it in scenario 4 require I presume moving off from CloudFoundry.com to anther CloudFoundry should be fairly easy if needed.p  pc. How much sysadmining does deploying on AWS EC2  EBS involve for the described application Assuming I dont care that much for temporary outages, but care about permanent data loss, do I need to mirror the EBS on my own, or can I just leave AWS to do itp  pd. Which of the new options AppScale, CloudFoundry, EC2EBS would work fine with a Windows  Eclipse based development approach Which has the best Eclipse plugins p  pIm asking because upon quick review of AppScale docs, it seems they assume the development VM will be hosted by a Unix host, which is another hassle for me.p  pe.

Negative 1283 pMy project is written by both Java and Python. I wonder there is any tool that can package Python code to Java war file  Basically my java code will be compiled to a war file, and python code are packaged in a few of egg files then be put into classes folder of war file.

Negative 1283 pWe have a generic slider functionality implemented in our product.

Negative 1283 pHopefully this isnt obvious to others because I find the docs at a hrefhttpjsonschema.orghttpjsonschema.orga to be lacking in finer details. Im getting a block of json with some properties that can be null or a string. How do you specify, in a json schema to be parsed by json.NETs codeJsonSchema.Parsecode method, that a value can be of type null or type stringp  pIs there something simple Im missing like supplying an array for the type For examplep  precode  memberregion  type [ string, null ]   this throws an exception codepre  pAlso, does anyone have a better source for json schema details then the jsonschema.org Where can I find a larger selection of examples I dont want to read a big docspec to find something that can easily be demonstrated in a 10 line example.p
Negative 1283 pWe have a masterpage for our website made in asp.net c visual studio 2010. It shows perfect in safari, opera, chrome, firefox and IE10, but IE9 shows a big white block between the menu en the content. p  pWhen we push F12 and inspect the element it highlights the form that has everything wrapped inside it this was done so that more that on other pages the notation form runatserver is not necessary anymore, since more than one of those forms running at server gives an

codeIParentServicecode has a dependency on codeChildServicecode created via the DependencyCreation extension no hard reference. p  pBoth services are registered on a local event broker instance local to codeParentServicecode.p  pI want the codeIParentServicecode to be scoped per request and I want the dependency and event broker to be disposed of at the same time as the codeIParentServicecode, however, Im getting a codeScopeDisposedExceptioncode. strongWhat am I doing wrongstrongp  pSome codep  pstrongService Definitionsstrongp  precodepublic interface IParentService    public class

set in the call to codeRegisterOnEventBrokercode, where the code attempts to unregister any objects registered on the event broker. It fails because the event broker scope has been disposed, presumably because the parent service has been disposed. As far as I am aware, Ninject will only call OnDeactivation delegates for objects with lifetimes other than Transient scope, so why this doesnt work when the parent service is registered in codeRequestScopecode confuses me. Transient scope is not sufficient for the parent service because Im experiencing memory leaks because of this issue.p  pIm starting to wonder if this is a bug in the EventBroker extension.p

The Object 1 column and the Image takes the height of the image, but the height is not divided evenly between each four providers. Only the 4th resizes to fill the remaining spaces.p  pNow I know my html layout may be crappy since Im beginning in html formatting, and Id like to know how to shape this correctly so that every lines are evenly sized.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pMy case is hard to describe, but heres an excel demonstration of what I want and what I gotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQbt2c.png altProblem example using excelp

Negative 1283 pI have a clientserver model that uses SSL on every connection. I have used Java and the common libraries to program this. I have two questions regarding the SSL safetyp  p1 strongIs it considered safe to send the password in plaintext from the client to the serverstrong The server uses BCrypt to hash the password and store it. I have considered sending an unsalted hash of the password or a nounced hash of the password, but are they truly more safe than sending password in plaintext I doubt it. I dont think sending the password as a salted hash is a viable option, as the salt would need to be stored somewhere in the client or send over the network, and thus I dont think it would make it inherently more safe as sending the password as plaintext. Due to SSL nobody else should be able to read it anyway, rightp  p2 strongDoes encrypted data on SSL always gets encrypted to a different string, and if so, can you use an earlier encryption of a certain string to get the same result laterstrong To clarifyp  ul liIf you encrypt data now, and a few seconds later, does it procide the same cipher textli liIf you use the cipher text from encrypting test, can you send the same cipher text on a later moment to let the server believe that the client legitly sent testli ul  pUnder all circumstances the assumption should be made that I do not want to approach this from my own client or server perspective, but I want to approach this from a hackercheaters point of view.p  pRegards.p

Negative 1283 pIm implementing webgl picking from scratch, and have decided to go down the GLSL route, as oppose to ray intersection testing. p  pso Im rendering the whole scene into a separate frame buffer, assigning each object a unique color which is passed to the fragment shader as a uniform variable.  when the scene is rendered then I gl.readPixels the buffer, and get the color values at the click coordinates I invert the coord system to account for GL differing from the browsers coord system. p  pthe issue Im having is that shaders represent colors passed to the glFragColor shader output as vec4 floats with 0.01.0 range per color channel, whereas gl.readPixels returns color channels as integers in the 0255 range... doing this translation loses some precision, and might create picking errors if there are a lot of objects in the scene more then 255, or if the integertofloat rounding is larger then the granularity needed to differentiate between different object IDs. p  pdoes anyone have an idea how to resolve this, or point me in the right direction can readPixels return float values for color channels in the 0.01.0 range can I pack a single object ID spread over multiple channels so that Im not limited to a single channel and only being able to pick 255 objectsp  pthank you for your helpp

Negative 1283 pI am using joda time to compare an array of dates.  My goal is to go through the array and see what dates are missing.  I plan on accomplishing this by assigning the first variable in the array to a codeDateTimecode variable, then counting up the array and Date Time.  If the codeDateTimecode equals codearray[x]code, then both the codeDateTimecode and the array will increment by one.  If the codeDateTimecode does not equal the array meaning that a date is missing the codeDateTimecode will increment by one and print out the date until codeDateTimecode equals codeArray[x]code.  At the moment though, I am just trying to get it so that the first date at holder[2] is the value of codeDateTime firstDatecode.p  pMy question is how do I make it so that I can assign codeholder[2]code to codeDateTime firstDatecode Simply assigning codefirstDatecode to codeholder[2]code is returning an error.p  precodeDateTime firstDate  new DateTime DateTimeFormatter dtf  DateTimeFormat.forPatternyyyyMMDD String date  dtf.printfirstDate  String fake  while fake  reader.readLine  null      String [] holder  fake.split       firstDate  holder[2] the issue     System.out.printlnfirstdate   codepre  pImportant things about my codep  ol lipI am using a codeBufferedReadercode to take information in from a very large file 20gb so I am reading in from the text file line by line and for each line codeholder[2]code is the datepli lipThe format of the Date on the text file is in yyyymmdd and I want to compare the string of that to the string of codeDateTimecode thus the first thing I need to do is assign the first value of the array to codeDateTimecode which just happens to be my question.pli lipI have correctly setup Joda Timepli ol

Is there a way to accelerate the initialization with SSE Can you suggest how Do I need to use arrays or SSE can be used with vectors as wellp  pPlease, since I need your help lets all avoid a how did you measure the time or b premature optimization is the root of all evil which are both reasonable for you to ask but a the measured time is correct b I agree with it but I have no other choice.

Negative 1283 pI have about 100,000 email addresses in a CSV file. Each one is associated with a member ID.p  pI have an API call that allows me to look up a member ID by email, however, it does not allow me to look up by improperly formatted emails. To solve this, I am trying to skip over specific errors The API returns a code400code error when sent an improperly formatted email, so this is my codep  precodeurl  HTTParty.getbaseuricall,   basicauth gt auth,   headers gt Accept gt applicationjson   if url.code  400    puts 400   next else   ..... codepre  pThis works for the most part. It seems to cycle through the list doing exactly what it should until it reaches a certain email, at which point it fails every time. The email it is failing on is formatted with a leading codeltcode signp  precodeltarq.lus.army.mil codepre  pWhen it reaches this, the script stops and does not codeputs 400code. It fails at the API call and doesnt do anything past that, and I cant figure out why.p  pAs a side note, when I try to type the email here on StackOverflow outside of the codecodecode parameter, it automatically hides everything past the codeltcode sign. Could this have something to do with it I feel like the codeltcode sign is being communicated in the code as something I am unaware of.p  pI am using Ruby 1.9.3.p

Negative 1283 pOK. This is my first post ever, and also Im programming my first serious webpage, so this has been quite an experience. I ran into a annoying problem when I was coding a Gallery. p  pCode explained  The first thing I did was get the src directory from the logo of the website. Once he got it, the code proceeds to obtain the length of the directory string, and then go back 2 slashes in the directory to obtain the location of the files ergo, the webpageserver directory, but this works for anyplace you have the code, being the desktop or the server. Once extracted the location, the code proceeds to merge all the location strings into a new variable called locationNew, which now contains 1. the location extracted before, 2. the folder which is the location variable passed in the function, 3. the progresion, which is the number of the image in the folder, and 4. the file type.br  Now, HERE is where it gets interesting. This locationNew string is passed to a function called fileExists which executes the Http request. If it finds the file, it returns true, if not, false.br  When Im working in dreamweaver it works perfectly, but when I use the website on the server, it ALWAYS returns 200, so it returns TRUE, when actually the file doesnt exists, so the gallery goes on forever when it should stop loading pictures when it finds the last picture, 13.png.  p  precodefunction galeriaposicion, locacion       var pho1document.getElementByIdfoto1     var pho2document.getElementByIdfoto2     var pho3document.getElementByIdfoto3     var pho4document.getElementByIdfoto4          var logo  document.getElementByIdlogoImagen         var direccionLogo  logo.src             var longitudString0           var slashes0           longitudStringdireccionLogo.length            var numeroAislado           var blanco                  whileslashes2                        longitudString             ifdireccionLogo.charAtlongitudString                              slashes                                                                          var direccionWhole           var blanco             whilelongitudString gt 0                        direccionWhole  blanco.concatdireccionLogo.charAtlongitudString,direccionWhole             longitudString                               var progresionposicion         var numeroArchivo0         var distanciaLeft72         var imgPho1           whileprogresionposicion4                               var locacionNew  direccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                     var existe  fileExistslocacionNew                    ifexistetrue                                          ifimgPho1                                                  pho1.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                              ifimgPho2                                                  pho2.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                              ifimgPho3                                                  pho3.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                              ifimgPho4                                                  pho4.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                                             else                                          ifimgPho1                                                  pho1.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                              ifimgPho2                                                  pho2.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                              ifimgPho3                                                  pho3.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                              ifimgPho4                                                  pho4.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                                                    imgPho              numeroArchivo             distanciaLeft178             progresion                 function fileExistsurl           ifurl                       var req             ifwindow.XMLHttpRequest              Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE7                 reqnew XMLHttpRequest                          else              IE5, IE6                 reqnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                          req.openGET, url, false             req.send             return req.status200                   else                           return false            codepre  pI was going to include pictures of the gallery but i need 10 reputation to include them.........p  pAnyway, Ill leave the description to give an idea, a very vague idea.p  hr  pThis is how it looks The 1,2,3,4 black squares are actually files this code finds perfectly. p  pand this is how it looks normally when it reaches the end, at file 13.png. The Red Squares are files named 0.png, that the code assigns when it doesnt find the picture of the progresion variable. p  pBUT, when I test the gallery from the server, it looks like this. The code always receive a TRUE in the http request function, so it assigns a false directory to the DIV container, pointing to a 16.png that doesnt exists.p  pIf I click the right black vertical bar, which is another function that obtains the number from the last picture which normally is 0 but now its 16, it goes on pointing to nonexistent pictures.p  pMy theory is that the 404 page setting from the GoDaddy hosting server is messing with the 404 signal and is considering that 404 page as if the picture actually exists and returns a 200 status. But as I said, its just a theory. p  hr  pIf anyone knows this issue or if it happened to you before, please comments, its literally driving me insane.p

Negative 1283 pIm using UIPanGestureRecognizer to pan around in my game cocos2d 2.0, its been working fine, from iOS 5.x to 6.x. Suddenly in iOS 7 its getting very choppy. You can pan around for a while, but eventually it becomes inaccurate. Even before my game code does anything with the gesture I can clearly see in my logs that the translation is jumping around 35 points. Normally a smooth finger drag only has translation spread out 1 points per change. Swiping near the edges of the screen seems to immediately cause the problem, but just panning causes it as well. p  pDid anything change that would cause problems with cocos2d Or the gesture recognizer in general p

Negative 1283 pIm in the need of creating an image composed of multiple PNGs with transparency. My solution works perfectly in desktop, but Id like to know if I could increase performance  on mobile iOS.p  pMy current solution is as followsp  pFirst I load all the images to memory with codeImageDecodingPolicy.ONLOADcode as to avoid any CPU and lag while loading and decoding images.p  pSecond I load the needed images to a codeSpritecode which is never added to the display list.p  pFinally I compose all the images into a codeBitmapDatacode object, and fade the new composed image over the previous one.p  precodebitmapData.drawcompositionBufferSprite,null,null,null,rect,false codepre  pI need to compose the whole image instead of having all the PNGs on the stage without any composition because I need to make the transition from the previous image to the new one as seamless as possible.p  pI tried working directly with the pixel data of the images and such, but the performance and time spent on working was exactly the same as using codedrawcode. I also tried using codedrawWithQualitycode with codeStageQuality.LOWcode and there was no difference at all. My conclusion at the time was that Air has already optimised all that bitmap work and it really doesnt matter if I codedrawcode or compose directly from codeBitmapDatacode.p  pIve thought about creating an ANE native extension but I have no clue if that would allow greater performance. So far it seems ANEs are only there for accessing native APIs not share work load.p  pDo you have any ideas on how I could improve thisp

Negative 1283 pI have a question about passing data in iOSObjectiveC. I just started creating an app that connects and fetches data from a website, and now Im having a problem.p  pMy default and root view controller is called codeViewControllercode. It has the basic login UI views 2 textfields and a button.p  pWhen the button has been clickedtouched, the codeViewControllercode calls a method from another class called codeLoginServicecode. Now codeLoginServicecode handles the connection to the website. I have no problem connecting to the website and fetching data from it, but I have a problem returning the fetched data, now processed as an NSDictionary, to the codeViewControllercode.p  pThe first thing I tried was to create a setter method in the codeViewControllercode that sets the instance variable codeuserProfilecode to the NSDictionary passed into it. It failed, however. I tried using it in the NSURLConnectionDataDelegate method codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcode from the codeLoginServicecode.p  pThis might be a silly question, but I have no idea how can I pass the fetched NSDictionary from LoginService to the ViewController after the button is clicked. Do I need blocks, queue, or something else I mean, for example, I need to set a label below my login button to the name of the user who logged in. How can I perform thisp  pHope someone can help me. Id greatly appreciate it.p

Negative 1283 pIm trying to deploy a Clojure app in both .jar and .war format. So far Ive successfully deployed a .jar Im working on the .war. The app is just a test app which is meant to demonstrate some of the capabilities of Clojure and JavaFX. Im meaning to deploy it via AWS Elastic Beanstalk to a website Ive only just begun to set up. At the moment, the app simply displays a bunch of blurred circles moving around a 600x600 stage for 40 seconds. However, even though the application runs successfully for those 40 seconds, it always terminates suddenly after those 40 seconds of animation. My project.clj file looks like thisp  precodedefproject clojurefxarg 0.0.10SNAPSHOT   description Helper functions and probably a wrapper to simplify usage of JavaFX in Clojure.

Also, when I put the code for the JavaFX object initialization and display in a function, lets say, codeinitstagecode, such that the code isnt evaluated at runtime until the function is explicitly called, the timeout begins immediately after the JVM is launched and the codemaincode function is called.p  pThoughts I realize that the intersect of the set of people who know Clojure and the set of people who know JavaFX 8 is incredibly small...p  pADDITIONAL INFOp  pI theres another related problem.

Negative 1283 pfirst of all I am sorry if this topic has already been discussed somewhere else but I could not find anything relevant when searching.p  pMy problem is the following I have 4 vectors with partially overlapping names and I want to organize all these data into a matrix. I want the final matrix to have an entry for all the names present in at least one of the input vectors. I used the following code.p  precodeIDs lt uniquecnamesv1, namesv2, namesv3, namesv4  mat lt matrixcv1[IDs], v2[IDs], v3[IDs], v4[IDs], nrowlengthIDs, ncol4 mat[is.namat] lt 0   This last line is to convert NAs generated when the entry isnt present in all vectors into 0 values.  codepre  pIt works well but, as I have a total of entries  2.2 millions, this is extremely slow it took 2.5 days to run.... I am thus looking for a way to speed up the process.p  pI tried to use other structures e.g. to create a data frame instead of a matrix but without great improvement. After some tests, it seems that the bottleneck is the following step even when considered individuallyp  precodev1[IDs] codepre  pwhich is repeated for each of the vectors 1 to 4. Note that typically only 50 of the names overlap between two vectors  and therefore that only 50 of IDsnames used for indexing are initially present in the names of the vector.p  pI monitored a bit the CPU and memory used  during the process and it seems that it is not a memory issue the 6 free Gb remained free during the process.p  pI would appreciate any hint on how to make this process faster. As I have to repeat this process several times, I cant really afford to wait 2 days each time I have to generate such an object.p  pThanks. p  pPhilippe.p

Negative 1283 pWe are currently using Prism and Structuremap for our WPF application and want to implement the IDisposable pattern.  All examples that i found for using StructureMap and IDisposable are implementantions for web projects using HttpContext etc. For example, we are using an unmanaged ressource in our ViewModel and in certain services. It is not possible to put this ressource in a using block, because they are often called in each class.p  pIn our situation we have a viewmodel which is created by StructureMap. StructureMap injects a business logic object into this viewmodel. The business logic object holds a reference to an object that implements IDisposable. Because of that our business logic class has to implement IDispsable, too. p  pOur problem is, that we have no idea, how we could dispose the business logic class. The view model class shouldnt dispose the business logic because it didnt create the business logic object. In fact StructureMap should dispose the business logic class, but we have no idea how tell StructureMap to dispose the business logic class as soon as possible when the user closes the view in the application.p  pThis wouldnt be a problem in a web application because you could tell StructureMap to dispose the object via DisposeAndClear when the requests ends. In a WPF  Prism Application there is no Request end, so what would be the best solution in this scenariop  pBecause the object that is held by the business logic class could use a huge amount of memory, we have to make really sure to dispose the object as soon as the view is closed and not when the thread ends.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

If I put codefiltervaremail, filtervalidateemailcode it codereturns falsecode regardless of the input.p  pThe second problem is that when loading the page it initially adds a blank entry into the SQL database and it adds entries that arent valid. i.e. if I dont enter a name when the form is submitted the validation runs and I get the codeerror message name is requiredcode but it still creates an entry in the table with a blank name.p  pI am using PHP version 5.3.27p  pThis is for my tafe course i am doing however they are on holidays at the moment so any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pCoding from file 1p  precodeltbodygt ltphp   define variables and set to empty values nameErr Name  Address  Phone  Mobile  Emailexampleexample.com  if SERVER[REQUESTMETHOD]  POST   if emptyPOST[Name] nameErr  Name is required   else Name  testinputPOST[Name]  if emptyPOST[Address]  Address   else  Address  testinputPOST[Address]  if emptyPOST[Phone]  Phone   else  Phone  testinputPOST[Phone]  if emptyPOST[Mobile]  Mobile   else  Mobile  testinputPOST[Mobile]     iffiltervarEmail, FILTERVALIDATEEMAIL   echoValid Email   else  echo Not a Valid Email      echo phpinfo   function testinputdata  data  trimdata data  stripslashesdata data  htmlspecialcharsdata return data   gt  ltform nameaddcontact methodpost action ltphp echo htmlspecialcharsSERVER[PHPSELF]gt, addcontact.phpgt  lttable border1 cellpadding2gt ltcaptiongt Add New Caption ltcaptiongt lttrgt lttdgtltlabel forNamegtNameltlabelgtlttdgt lttdgtltinput typetext nameName size30 maxlenght50 tabindex1gt ltspan classerrorgtltphp echo nameErrgtltspangt lttdgt lttrgt  lttrgt lttdgtltlabel forAddressgtAddressltlabelgtlttdgt lttdgtlttextarea nameAddress cols45 rows5 tabindex2gtlttextareagtlttdgt lttrgt  lttrgt lttdgtltlabel forPhonegtPhoneltlabelgtlttdgt lttdgtltinput typetext namePhone size20 maxlenght20 tabindex3 gt lttdgt lttrgt  lttrgt lttdgtltlabel forMobilegtMobileltlabelgtlttdgt lttdgtltinput typetext nameMobile size20 maxlenght20 tabindex4 gt lttdgt lttrgt  lttrgt lttdgtltlabel forEmailgtEmailltlabelgtlttdgt lttdgtltinput typetext nameEmail size30 maxlenght50 tabindex5 gtlttdgt lttrgt  lttrgt lttd colspan2 aligncentergtltinput typeSubmit nameSubmit valueSubmit tabindex6gt       lttdgt lttrgt   lttablegt ltformgt  ltphp  includeaddcontact.php gt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt  And coding from file 2   ltbodygt ltphp  Name  POST[Name] Address  POST[Address] Phone  POST[Phone] Mobile  POST[Mobile] Email  POST[Email]   dbc  mysqlconnectlocalhost3306, root, webbm01 if dbc die Could not connect  .mysqlerror   dbselected  mysqlselectdbtafe, dbc  if dbselected die Could not connect  . mysqlerror  qry   INSERT INTO contacts Name, Address, Phone, Mobile, Email VALUES  . addslashesName . ,  . addslashesAddress . ,  . addslashesPhone . ,  . addslashesMobile. ,  . addslashesEmail .   rst  mysqlqueryqry, dbc  if rst  echo ltbgtltfont colorgreengtThe contact has been added.ltfontgtltbgt  else   echo ltbgtltfont colorredgtError . mysqlerrordbc . .

Negative 1283 pIve just ported my application from Qt 4.8.4 to Qt 5.2.1. I have an issue with the codeFlowLayoutcode class as provided in the a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5.0qtwidgetslayoutsflowlayout.htmlFlowLayout example code in the Qt docsa.p  pI have a codeQMainWindowcode with a codeQDockWidgetcode docked at the bottom of the central widget. The codeQDockWidgetcode has a codeFlowLayoutcode with several child widgets. In Qt 4.8, this worked like a charm, the size of the child widgets fitted the standard size of the codeDockWidgetcode. However, in Qt 5.2, the codeDockWidgetcode tries to increase its size to the maximum taking the place from the central widget. Changing its layout prevents this unwanted behavior. But of course, I use codeFlowLayoutcode on purpose.p  pTo illustrate the problem, I created a minimal example p  pThe constructor of the codeDockWidgetcodep  precode    QGroupBox generalBox  new QGroupBox     generalBoxLayout  new FlowLayout     generalBoxgtsetLayoutgeneralBoxLayout      forint i0 ilt10 i              QPushButton button  new QPushButtonTest, this         buttongtsetMinimumWidth100         buttongtsetMinimumHeight100         generalBoxLayoutgtaddWidgetbutton           thisgtsetWidgetgeneralBox codepre  pDoes someone know what the problem is and how I can solve itp  pstrongEditstrong Ive created a new minimal working example and unfortunately cannot reproduce the discrepancy between Qt 4.8 and Qt 5.2.

Negative 1283 pIm trying to build a function in RacketScheme, where you are given a list of integers, and then it has to sort them into two sublists, one for even numbers, and one for odd numbers.  Im very new to racket, and I have some of the basics down with manipulating lists, but I cant seen to figure out how to define two sublists and put numbers in each one.  p  pThis is what I have so far p  precode    define segregate lst       if empty lst                      if even car a lst               append car alst segregate cdr alst codepre  pAnd from there Im stuck. So with that if condition, even numbers will be sorted into one list.  But I need the odd numbers too.  The else statement in this condition will give you those odd numbers, but I have no idea how to get them into a separate list. p  pThis is the first time Ive actually asked a question  on this site, because my professor is not in his office for some reason.           p
Negative 1283 pI just started to code a new project for android devices. Its going to be some kind of puzzle game. The problem I faced is I want to make a menu where user is able to choose the level he wants to play. Maybe some of you guys remember the old game called Elastomania I want to have the same level choose menu In the beginning, user can choose level 1, but he also has, lets say, 3 skips. After he uses that skip option on level X, next level is available, but of course, skip number decreases. When player completes the previously skipped level, number of skips increases, so he can skip next level he is stuck at. Is there any good way to do that Im asking such a question soon, because I would like to code it the way its supposed to be, dont wanna further problems when ill add next levels. So, whereamphow should I store such a data And by the way, what should be used for a level choice menu Should it be a grid layout for example Or is there any other way of solving this Beginner  android, sorry Kind regardsp

Negative 1283 pafter several days of researching and trying I want to see if you can help me. I have a graph coord and students should mark the extrema of the graph. I have to use JavaScript for this and work in XHTML 1.0 StrictEN. The idea was that the student clicks on the position on the graph where heshe thinks an extremum lies, this triggers a JavaScript function addPoint which adds an img into the same div in which the graph lies coordDiv and gives it the position where the student clicked. For an example visit a hrefhttpourresidence.netJavaScript relnofollowhttpourresidence.netJavaScripta where you should be able to view both the site code and the JavaScript code.p  pAs far as I understood, the positioning has to be absolute. static and fixed are incompatible with the desired behaviour and relative would be very difficult because 1. I dont know where the next ordinary positioning would be and 2. it would get more complicated with a student deleting a point. So, absolute it is. p  pThen the positioning should be absolute relative to the div coordDiv and after some time I even figured out how to give the div a concrete dimension through its a bit static, the approach with adjustCoordDiv in klausur.js hasnt work out. However, if I resize the bounderies of the browser, the div and the graph wanders since they are centered but the point does not. strongThatstrong needs to be fixed. p  pAnd reading how mixed up the acknowledgement of zooming is in different browsers by now Ive already completely given up handling zooming in the exercise, but if you come with a solution for that too, my praise would know no end.p

Negative 1283 pI am a little confused with the use of sessions in PHP, esp. with maintaining user sessions after login. So to maintain sessions, one of the methods that we can use is using the sessionstart in PHP. p  pNow sessionstart generates a unique sessionID and sends a cookie to the browser with this id, if I am correct as I read from several resources.p  pNow lets take a simple user login use case where I need to maintain sessions. So typically and a very simple scenario, user logs enters his username and password in the respective fields on the form. Then user presses the submit button. p  pThe POST values get sent to the PHP script, say login.php, that handles sessions. Inside login.php I check for POST[username] and POST[password] to see if it matches the values present in the db. Lets assume that the values match. p  pSo a new session should be created now, right Why do we include sessionstart in the beginning of login.php then p  pSecondly, so after the session is started and a sessionID is created it is sent in a cookie to the browser and is also recorded in the SESSIONS global variable. So now the thing is where in all this did we bind this session with this particular user  I understand that since the cookie will be sent by the user with every request, and since the server has the same sessionID, as in the cookie, maintained at its end as well, the server would know that the request is coming from the same user. But then we are not recording this sessionID explicitly anywhere in the db etc. for this user. So if i need all the other details about this user, how would i get it  So how exactly is the sessionID connected with a particular users details stored in the db p  pSo to give an example, lets assume that in the above case the user we discussed was say USER A. For a second user, say USER B also all the above would hold true. So now the server will definitely be able to distinguish between requests from both these users because of the 2 different sessionIDs that will be sent by these users in the cookies with their requests. But on the server side, how will USER As request be linked with USER As details in the db and how will USER Bs request be linked with USER Bs details in the db p

From what I can tell, it seems to be the same dead end,  they do not accept the signed SamlSecurityToken.

Negative 1283 pWhile playing around with 1n relationships using EntitySet, a question came to my mind p  pSay I have two classes A and B and I want to establish an A 1  B n relationship p  pOn DB level I have 2 tables A and B, where the table B has a reference column AId and a FK constraint to ensure that AId references a primary key of a record in table A. I then added an EntitySet in class A to access many B records as members of A 1n. Ids are autogenerated. p  pSo far so good. But when I now create a new A and add a B to its entity set and call submitChanges it will fail with a FK violation because Bs AId column is set to 0. p  pMy question Is linqtosql supposed to automatically care about assigning the correct Id to all Bs in its entity set when I submit the changes Or do I need to take care about that by myself insert an A first, set the referencing id on all Bs accordingly, then insert the Bsp  pAll examples on the web just use queries  I didnt find any examples about strongstoringstrong 1n relationships. p  pThx and regardsp

Ideally a codemaincode function should read the source and the sink which are imaginary anyway and are only neccessary for the algorithm to work, and then all the data neccessary to build the graph with codeAddEdgecode. But how to do that is currently beyond me. p  pMy codemaincode should look like thisp  precodeint main      int source, sink     vector lt vector lt int gt gt graph     stdcin gtgt source gtgt sink     here should be the nested for loops to read in the graph       and here the arguments should be passed to AddEdge     return 0  codepre  pI think that codesourcecode should be used to iniialise some codeEdge.fromcodes, and it should be similar with codesinkcode and some codeEdge.tocodes, but I cant figure how to build a graph. p
Negative 1283 pIm trying to make a menu where I can change the cell property of a person. Cells are defined as p  precodeCells [  name NE, id 1 ,  name NW, id 2 ,  name SE, id 3 ,  name SW, id 4  ] codepre  pMy html codep  precodeltdivgtltselect ngmodelui.returnedPeopleList[row.rowIndex] ngoptionscell for cell in Cellsgtltselectgtltdivgt codepre  preturnedPeopleList is an array of people. Basically what I have is a grid of people. Double clicking a person opens a modal instance where you can change their properties hence, the row.rowIndex. The row is passed to the instance modal instance, where the changes are made. Im not sure how much of this is relevant to the dropdown Im pretty new to angular. p  pThe dropdown menu is empty, and I have no idea whats wrong. Thanks in advance. p

I want to test this part of the flow.

This work.p  pNow the problem is that there is another username pablo in another pc pc12. So I obviously cant add both keys to the keydir as they both have the same file name.

Negative 1283 pI have extracted a 3D point cloud from a stereo camera system. So basically I have two cameras with known baseline. I have calibrated the cameras intrinsically. So I only have intrinsic camera calibration matrices K1 and K2. I do not have extrinsic camera calibration matrices. Then I stereo rectified the images using Caltech toolbox a hrefhttpwww.vision.caltech.edubouguetjcalibdochtmlsexample5.html relnofollowhttpwww.vision.caltech.edubouguetjcalibdochtmlsexample5.htmla. Then I extracted features from stereo rectified images using SIFT and feature matching. Then found fundamental matrix F using RANSAC. Then I assumed the world coordinate is aligned with camera coordinates of the first camera. Sop  pP1K1[eye3, [000]]p  pThen I found essential matrix using camera calibration matrices and fundamental matrix. p  pEssential  K2FK1p  pThen I found the second camera projection matrix P2 from essential matrix. Finally I performed triangulation using point correspondences and camera projection matrices from both cameras to find the 3D point cloud. The whole process is very similar to this a hrefhttpvglait.orgcvwikidoku.phpidmatlabtutorial3dreconstructionwithcalibratedimagesequences relnofollowhttpvglait.orgcvwikidoku.phpidmatlabtutorial3dreconstructionwithcalibratedimagesequencesap  pNow my questions arep  p1 Since my camera calibration matrices are not metric, the extracted 3D point cloud is not metric either. It is in pixels. How can I convert the 3D point cloud from pixels to metricp  p2 How can I find the distance in millimeters of the objects in the scene from the cameras from this 3D point cloud I am using a bumblebee XB3 cameras and from their website I know the cameras sensor size is 3.75 micrometers. How can I use thatp  pThanksp

Both must have the same database because data has to be shared between the website and the nodejs application.p  pSo, which cloud provider can be the best to host these two projects  Something like AWS or Azure Websites, cloudservice, VM, ... , or OVH or Ikoula which are really less expansive.p  pThanksp
Negative 1283 pI have a sample application which uses a  dynamically linked library codelibrary.socode. I was measuring CPU usage of the sample application with the top command.

The amout of broken pixels seems to vary depending on the image dimensions. However, some of the pixel manage to stay intact.

Could this be a string encoding problem or somethingp  pstrongEditstrong I have tested the program on OS X and the error is very similar. Therefore, it seems to be a general issue with the Python bindings to GdkPixbuf, potentially related to a hrefhttpsbugzilla.gnome.orgshowbug.cgiid721497 relnofollowthisa.

Negative 1283 pQuestion from a relative HadoopHive newbie  How can I pass the contents of a Microsoft Word binary document as a parameter to a Hive functionp  pMy goal is to be able to provide the full contents of a binary file a Microsoft Word document in my particular use case as a binary parameter to a UDTF.  My initial approach has been to slurp the files contents into a staging table and then provide it to the UDTF in a query later on, and this was how I attempted to build that staging tablep  precodecreate table worddoccontent BINARY load data inpath pathtowordfile into table worddoc codepre  pUnfortunately, there seem to be newlines in the Word document or something acting enough like newlines that results in the staging table having many rows instead of a single comprehensive blob, the latter of which is what I was hoping for.  Is there some way of ensuring that the ingest doesnt get exploded into multiple rows  Ive seen similar questions here on SO regarding other binary data like image files, so that is why Im guessing its the newlines that are tripping me up.p  pFailing all that, is there a way to skip storing the files contents in an intermediary Hive table and just provide the content directly to the UDTF at invocation time  Nothing obvious jumped out during my search through Hives builtin functions, but maybe I am missing something.p  pVersionwise, the environment is Hive 0.13.1 and Hadoop 1.2.1 although upgrades to both are pending.p

Negative 1283 pI am trying to finish my first website and thought it was pretty much finished but am having an issue with viewing some page layouts on an iPhone 5 S and C.

Negative 1283 pI am working with web services right now. We have two types of services, one over HTTP and other over TCP. when Trying to understand the difference between these two, as per my understanding, services over TCP work at the transport layer i.e they transmit data over two ends. So in that case services over TCP will directly transfer data between two ends. But i am not so much clear on services over HTTP. I know we have a Client server model, REST, SOAP and HTTP is the protocol that transmits data but i am not able to properly relate the concept of services over HTTP p  pCan anyone please help with an analogy which explains the difference between the two p

Negative 1283 pI am using django 1.7. In my models.py I created two models A and B. I execute makemigrations command, after its successful execution I run the migration command which throws some exception in with regards model B. I made the required corrections and, run makemigrations and migration commands respectively. When migration command executes, it gives me a exception stating that Model A already exists. In both the cases the migrate command had failed so how can Model A be created. Please someone could help me with this. Let me know if some more information is required.p  pThanksp

Negative 1283 pI have created a number of standalone automated testcases captured using CodedUITest in Visual Studio 2013, to test webpages.p  pThey work fine within Visual Studio, individually and when several of them are put into a single project as a solution, to create a kind of playlist.p  pHowever, Im trying to use Microsoft Test Manager as a frontend  in order to be able to select which tests, create playlists, decide how many times a specific testcase should be run etc, with the results stored.p  pTFS is being used to both store my individual testcases, and, where Id like to deposit the resultant output of passfail etc.p  pTrouble is, even though the testautomation part functions very well within Visual Studio, getting Microsoft Test Manager to function with what I have, and its associated environment is proving a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.p  pMy system is simple I have a virtual machine setup with the testing environment which allows within VS for me to run these automated tests.p  pWhy is this proving so difficult to work with MTM It should be easy  I should simply be having to point MTM at the folder my testcases are stored, and use its GUI to tell it what and how many tests I want to run.p  pAnyone else have a similar problem, or a similar setupp  pAll MS do is point me to countless pages which Ive already read  for which the whole lot seems to be much deeper than it needs to be.p
Negative 1283 pI am having a problem with a piece of code that Im writing.  I have created a parent workbook which will be used by multiple users as the basis for some basic reporting.  This workbook creates a number of child workbooks by VBA.  The end users then enter values in these child workbooks, which are aggregated in the parent workbook.p  pHowever, I am having trouble with using a variable in a formula.  If I use a formula such as egp  precodeActiveCell.Formula  SThisIsAnExampleFilePathName.xlsx codepre  pthen the formula works fine.  However, what I need to do is change the path so that Name in the example above is actually a variable fname, which is a global [string] variable.p  pI thought something like p  precodeActiveCell.Formula  SThisIsAnExampleFilePathamp fnameamp.xlsx codepre  pwith a few brackets in relevant places would do the trick, as thats what seems to recommended in the responses Ive seen to similar questions  but Ive tried all sorts of permutations of bracketing of the above, none of which will do what I want.p

Negative 1283 pIm new to Swift and iOS in general, and would appreciate any help on this...Im making an app with one file called codeViewController.swiftcode, which contains the codeViewControllercode class, and another file called codeBTService.swiftcode, which contains the codeBTServicecode class.  I have a slider set up in the VC, and I want to take its value and use it in the codeBTServicecode class.  I asked a question about this previously a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29045167swiftreferencevariablefromspecificinstanceofdifferentclassSwift Reference Variable from Specific Instance of Different Classa and someone suggested I use codeNSUserDefaultscode to accomplish this.

Now, from my understanding, I can then go to my codeBTServicecode class and simply do thisp  pcodeIBAction func sliderValChangedsender UISlider          let defaults NSUserDefaults  NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults         let currentValue Float  defaults.floatForKeysliderValue         printlncurrentValuebr     codep  pHowever, this isnt working.  I dont get any syntax errors, but I also dont see any value printed to the console when I tweak the slider.  Interesting note is that I emdoem see an output of the value when I put a codeprintlncode statement in the VC, which shows that currentValue is being defined and is functioning like it should.  Any help on this would be very much appreciated.  Thanks so muchp

Negative 1283 pIm looking for clarity as to a good practice when it comes to using separate projects for the Business and Data layers in an ASP.Net web application. p  pIve seen solutions written where developers will create separate projects for these layers and then make references to them in the main project. However at my last development job the developer that designed out the site just created a Data and Business folder in the main project. We only had one project in the solution. We put our class files in there and just changed the namespace so they were ProjectName.Business and ProjectName.Data. That seemed to work just fine and I never saw a reason to use separate projects for those. p  pIm assuming there is justification to using separate projects instead of just a folder in the main project but I dont know what that is. Can someone give me some explanation why separate projects is preferred and ifwhy that would be better than just using a folder in the main projectp

Negative 1283 pSince ExecWB PRINTSAVE OLECMDEXECOPTDONTPROMPTUSER will no longer work in  IE 5, I have been trying to find an alternative.p  pIdeally, some open source software with a C interface that can directly accept as a parameter an IHTMLDocument2 interface and convert this to a pdf document.p  pOr a mechanism to save an IHTMLDocument2 to XPS without using the print dialog.p  pQt would be an option if I could convert from IHTMLDocument2 to QWebPageQWebFrame but it would have to be a conversion, I cannot use load as the url of the current IHTMLDocument2 might be rendered within a login and therefore the QWebPage will be unable to share mshtmls session state.p  pI was also thinking about getting the outerHTML of IHTMLDocument2 and passing this to QWebFramesetHtml which I can then easily print to pdf but the baseUrl will have to be loadable by QWebFrame which is session only.p  pI am really surprised at how cumbersome this is to print a webpage to a pdf with IE.p  pAny suggestions would be great, thanks.p

Negative 1283 pFirst things first, I am an amateur, selftaught ruby programmer who came of age as a novice engineer in the age of superfast computers where program efficiency was not an issue in the early stages of my primary GIS software development project. This technical debt is starting to tax my project and I want to speed up access to this lumbering GIS database.p  pIts a postgresql database with a postgis extension, controlled inside of rails, which immediately creates efficiency issues via the objectification of database columns when accessing andor manipulating database records with one or many columns containing text or spatial data easily in excess of 1 megabyte per column.p  pIts extremely slow now, and it didnt used to be like this.p  pOne strategy Im considering building child tables of my large spatial data tables state, county, census tract, etc so that when I access the tables I dont have to load the massive spatial columns every time I access the objects. But then doing spatial queries might be difficult on a parent tables children. Not sure exactly how I would do that but I think its possible.p  pMaybe I have too many indexes. I have a lot of spatial indexes. Do additional spatial indexes from tables Im not currently using slow down my queries How about having too many for one tablep  pThese tables have a massive amount of columns. Maybe I should remove some columns, or create parent tables for the columns with massive serialized hashesp  pThere are A LOT of tables I dont use anymore. Is there a reason other than tidiness to remove these unused tables Are they slowing down my queries Simply doing a count method on some of these tables takes TIME.p  pPS  Looking back at this 8 hours later, I think what Im equally trying to understand is how many of the above techniques are completely USELESS when it comes to optimizing rails database performancep

And throwing 1.2 back into Karma passes the test.p  pIts not a major issue, but can anyone tell me why the below method would fail in 1.3 but not 1.2 AND actually work correctly The specific issue is that validity is set correctly, but the viewValue is not committed, so modelValue remains undefined calling commitViewValue and digest in my tests does nothing, also,  neither does el.val... el.trigger....p  pTestp  precodedescribeFuture date validation directive, function      var scope, form      beforeEachmodulemyapp     beforeEachinjectfunctionrootScope, compile          var el  angular.elementltform nameformgtltinput typedate namefuture ngmodelmodel.dt futuredate ngmodeloptions updateOn default  gtltformgt          scope  rootScope.new         scope.model               dt null                   compileelscope         form  scope.form            This passes     itshould fail if date is in the past, function          var now  new Date.getTime         var day  1000  60  60  24         var yesterday  new Datenow  day          form.future.setViewValueyesterday, default         scope.digest          expectscope.model.dt.toBeUndefined         expectform.future.valid.toBefalse            This fails     itshould pass if date is in the future, function           var now  new Date.getTime         var day  1000  60  60  24         var tomorrow  new Datenow  day          form.future.setViewValuetomorrow, default         scope.digest          expectscope.model.dt.toEqualtomorrow         expectform.future.valid.toBetrue       codepre  pThe directivep  precodeangular.modulemyapp     .directivefutureDate, [function          return              require ngModel,             link functionscope, elem, attrs, ctrl                  ctrl.parsers.unshiftfunction viewValue                      var viewTicks  new DateviewValue.getTime                     var currentTicks  new Date.getTime                      if viewTicks gt currentTicks                          ctrl.setValidityfutureDate, true                         return viewValue                                           ctrl.setValidityfutureDate, false                     return                                            ] codepre  pAny ideasp

Negative 1283 pI am writing a program to simulate Knights tour randomly. See wikipedia for what it means a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKnight27stour relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKnight27stoura First, I create a chess object, which is basically just a 88 array with numbers to indicate the position of the knight. I create a chess object and randomly assign a position for the knight.  Then, I moved the knight randomly until there is no more legal moves and returns the number of moves performed.p  precodeint runTour          srand timeNULL      Chess knightrand8, rand8 Initialize random chess object.     knight.printBoard Prints the board before moving     int moveNumber  0 A number from 0 to 7 that dictates how the knight moves     int counter  0      while moveNumber  1 A moveNumber of 1 means there is no more legal move                 moveNumber  knight.findRandMoveknight.getRow, knight.getColumn findRandMove is a function that returns a legal random move for the knight based on its position. It works perfectly.         knight.movemoveNumber move is a function that moves the knight         counter            knight.printBoard  Returns board when move is exhausted      return counter Returns number of moves performed. codepre  pp  pThe interesting thing is that while it runs perfectly randomly from run to run, it keeps outputting the same thing in the same run. For example, this is the main functionp  precodeint main     runTour     runTour     return 0  codepre  pAnd in BOTH runTour it outputs where 0 represents positions not reached, 1 represents the current position of the knight, and 9 positions reachedp  precode0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0  0 9 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 1  0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 0 9 9 0 9  codepre  pAnd when I run it again, BOTH runTour outputp  precode0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 9 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 1 0 9 0 9 9 0 9  codepre  pSo the random function is random in different runs, but is the same in each run.

Negative 1283 pThis is more of a newbie question but Id like to know if there are any best practices, techniques or sources for helping understand large scale systems. Im able to debugdesigncode smaller systems very well but Im sort of stuck trying to figure this larger system out. p  pMore specifically, Im currently working with a large scale web application created with Java, javascript, JQuery, the Spring framework, JSP, Maven and WebLogic, which are all configured in Eclipse. Id also like to ask, how I can use the dev console and Eclipse to debug through this code and start figuring things out p
Negative 1283 pSo I have an array of objects which I want to send to an SQL Database from a Node.js using typescript. I use some lambda notation which I believe is a typescript thing. I have two queries I have to execute on each item in the array. How do I iterate through the array and execute the queries Each item can do its queries independently, but the two queries each one does must be done in order. I wrote this code up but I know it likely wont workp  precodedb.serialize gt      for var i  0 i lt arr.length i          db.getSELECT  FROM Table WHERE Id LIKE , arr[i].id, err, row gt                  if err                      throw err                                   if typeof row  undefined                      db.runINSERT INTO Table VALUES ,,, arr[i].id, arr[i].name, arr[i].description                  else                      db.runUPDATE Table SET Name,Description WHERE Id, arr[i].name, arr[i].description, arr[i].id                                              codepre  pThe issue I see this going into is that the for loop will continue executing even if the db.get callback function has not been called yet.

Negative 1283 pIm drawing an SVG line with a markerend to make it an arrow.

That is, the tip of the arrowhead should be at the endpoint of the line. How do I do that p  pMaking the line shorter to accommodate the size of the arrowhead wont really work. The size of the arrowhead depends on the thickness of the line which is good, but I dont know the thickness because it can be specified in a style element thats already been written to the SVG document.p  pIn this example, Id like the the arrowhead entirely inside the square, with its tip at the squares corner, rather than sticking out of the square.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltsvg xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlink version1.1gt ltggtltmarker idarrowhead0 viewBox0 0 60 60 refX0 refY30 markerUnitsstrokeWidth markerWidth8 markerHeight10 orientautogt             ltpath dM 0 0 L 60 30 L 0 60 z fill800000 gt ltmarkergt ltline markerendurlarrowhead0 x11 y11 x2100 y2100 stroke800000 gt ltrect x1 y1 width100 height100 strokegreen fillnonegt ltggtltsvggtcodepre div div p

Negative 1283 pGood day, here is an example for my simple I hope question. Imagine that thread needs to perform some stores and loads with a fence somewhere between themp  precodex.store1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed stdatomicthreadfencestdmemoryorderrelease y.store1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed reader.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed codepre  pAs far as I know, release fence forbids all reads and writes placed in program order embeforeem it to reorder with writes placed in program order emafterem it. But this definition says nothing about subsequent loads. So would it make any sense if Ill say that load to codereadercode may as well happen actually before fence or even before writing to codexcodep

Negative 1283 pa hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.caching.memorycache.aspx relnofollowSystem.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCachea is a class in the .NET Framework version 4 that caches objects inmemory, using strings as keys.  More than a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryxfhwa508.aspx relnofollowSystem.Collections.Generic.Dictionaryltstring, objectgta, this class has all kinds of bells and whistles that let you configure how much big the cache can grow to in either absolute or relative terms, set different expiration policies for different cache items, and so much more.p  pMy questions relate to the memory limits.  None of the docs on MSDN seem to explain this satisfactorily, and the code on Reference Source is fairly opaque.  Sorry about piling all of this into one SO question, but I cant figure out how to take some out into their own questions, because theyre really just different views of one overall question how do you reconcile idiomatic C.NET with the notion of a generally useful inmemory cache that has configurable memory limits thats implemented nearly entirely in managed codep  ol liDo key sizes count towards the space that the MemoryCache is considered to take up  What about keys in the intern pool, each of which should only add the size of an object reference to the size of the cacheli liDoes MemoryCache consider more than just the size of the object references that it stores when determining the size of the object being stored in the pool  emI mean... it has to, right  Otherwise, the configuration options are extremely misleading for the commoncase... for the remaining questions, Im going to assume that it does.emli liGiven that MemoryCache almost certainly considers more than the size of the object references of the values stored in the cache, how deep does it go    ol liIf I were implementing something like this, I would find it strongverystrong difficult to consider the memory usage of the child members of individual objects, without also pulling in parent reference properties.li lie.g., imagine a poorly but not stronginsanelystrong poorly designed class in a game application, codePlayercode.  codePlayercode has some playerspecific state thats encapsulated in a codepublic PlayerStateData PlayerState  get code property that encapsulates what direction the player is looking, how many sprockets theyre holding, etc., as well as a reference to the entire games state codepublic GameStateData GameState  get code that can be used to get back to the games much larger state from a method that only knows about a player.li liDoes MemoryCache consider both codePlayerStatecode and codeGameStatecode when considering the size of the contribution to the cacheli liMaybe its more like whats the strongtotalstrong size on the managed heap taken up by the objects directly stored in the cache, and everything thats reachable through members of those objectsli liIt seems like it would be silly to multiply the size of codeGameStatecodes contribution to the limit by 5 just because 5 players are cached... but then again, a likely implementation might do just that, and its difficult to count codePlayerStatecode without counting codeGameStatecode.li olli liIf an object is stored multiple times in the MemoryCache, does each entry count separately towards the limitli liRelated to the previous one, if an object is stored directly in the MemoryCache, but also indirectly through another objects members, what impact does either one have on the memory limitli liIf an object is stored in the MemoryCache, but also referenced by some other live objects completely disconnected from the MemoryCache, which objects count against the memory limit  What about if its an array of objects, some but not all of which have incoming external referencesli ol  pMy own research led me to a hrefhttpsgithub.comMicrosoftreferencesourceblobmasterSystem.Runtime.CachingSystemCachingSRef.cs relnofollowSRef.csa, which I gave up on trying to understand after getting a hrefhttpsgithub.comdotnetcoreclrblob4cf8a6b082d9bb1789facd996d8265d3908757b2srcvmcomutilnative.cppL2847L2855 relnofollowherea, which later leads a hrefhttpsgithub.comdotnetcoreclrblob4cf8a6b082d9bb1789facd996d8265d3908757b2srcgchandletablecore.cppL374L416 relnofollowherea.

Negative 1283 pI have developed a desktop application and a dllwrapper.p  pNow, i want to distribute the wrapper to some external developers. These developers are going to include the DLL in some of their projects and applications, and are going to call some functions. However, for a comercial reason, I only want to allow them calling some functions if they have installed my desktop application. So, the Wrapper checks that exist some values on windows registry, and if not throws an exception. I have developed this requisite with no problem.p  pHowever, I need help with the desktop application. How can I insert an entry on windows registry on the ClickOnce installation, and how can i remove it on when my desktop application is uninstalled.p  pIf is not  posible to insert a custom entry on the ClickOnce installation process, Is there any workaround to accomplish the commercial requisitep  pI know that ClickOnce inserts some entries under HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstallp  pBut I want to insert some custom entries.p  pUPDATEp  pI have taken a look to this similiar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1763611setregistrykeythroughclickonceinstallationSet registry key through ClickOnce installationap  pOn that question, an user asks how to run a clickonce application on startup. He asks how to insert a key on [HKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun].  But I DONT need to write a key on a SPECIFIC entry.p  pClickOnce already inserts key on windows register, so it has permisions to do it. It inserts keys under HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall by his own. I only need to set another key on the same entry that it is already inserting. But I cant figure out how configure it.p

Negative 1283 pFor the program Im working on, Id like to limit the length of each compiled function, so as to provide a hard upperbound on the distancesup1sup required to reach a function boundarysup2sup. Is there an option in GCC or Clang or really any compiler frameworktoolchain that will enable function splitting to do this  Or are there limitations that Im not aware of preventing thisp  psup1sup Distance here defined as any discrete unit smaller than a function  i.e., number of instructions, number of basic blocks, number of grey hairs on Jon Skeets headsup3sup, etc.p  psup2sup Im defining function boundary as location where a new stack frame is pushed on to the CPUs stack. To my understanding, this happens almost exclusively when a new function is called except occasionally for leaf functions that dont themselves call other functions.p  psup3sup This is just a joke.  We all know that Jon Skeets hair doesnt turn grey  it just garbage collects and a new hair is instantiated, good as new.p
