Positive 1709 pFirst of all, my question is basically the same as this onep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12321780howtodraganimagetomoveitsmoothlyonscreenwithactionscriptHow to drag an image to move it smoothly on screen, with ActionScriptap  pI want my dragged Sprites to keep up with the mouse onscreen, smoothly, without lagging behind.p  pAnd I notice that in the old ActionScript 3 Cookbook from waybackwhen that they used a similar solution for their DraggableSprite as was used in the above link. Namely, use the stage instance to listen for the MouseMove event and then read from the event.stageX and stageY properties.p  pIve done that.p  pBut my Sprite still doesnt stay locked with the mouse cursor. It lags behind. I feel like I must be missing something. However, if the solution posted above ie listen for stages MouseMove and use event.stageXY is still current and the problem Im describing should not be occurring, please also let me know. Even though its not supposed to work, Ive tried event.updateAfterEvent and it also doesnt seem to have any positive effect.p  pAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.p  pHeres a simple example of how Ive written the handlers.

Positive 1709 pI am having a lot of headache trying to make a game loop in Actionscript. Searched a lot and could not to find the answer. My idea isp  pWhen de game starts, it defined the units sequence of attack, based in their speed each player can have until 8 units, of any kind. I store this sequence into an Array. I did create the engine in Javascript returning the values in console.log... and works fine... but transporting it to AS3, the things arent working as I thought.p  pSo...

Positive 1709 pIm trying to get a two player version of Snake running but i am having trouble getting the second snake to work, player 1 plays with w,a,s and d while player 2 uses the arrow keys. Player 1 with w,a,s and d is working player 2 with the arrows does not. Instead the arrow keys control player 1 as well as w,a,s and d.I think it has to do with the onEnterFrame function but ive been starring at it for days and i cannot see anything.

In this scenario A ball is dropped on rectangle and creates a glow around it. My goal is to add other commands on the impact such as stop the motion and other, but as soon as I embedded the motion inside the ball, there is no glow and no motion stop. it works only if I have the motion on the top level on the timeline, the glow anyway.

Negative 1709 pI have to connect via tcp to a server that terminates responses with 0x4 instead of the standard 0x0. I want to keep things simple and use a synchronous sendreceive from the socket class. The send works but the receive blocks indefinitely because the server does not terminate messages with 0x0. I cannot synchronously read to the first 0x4 and close because I need to keep the connection open to send more messages.

Negative 1709 pIm currently looking at hosting solutions for my Ruby on Rails SaaS web application, and the biggest issue I see is that if I go with something like Amazon EC2, then I still need to configure my own server and install what I need e.g. database, programming framework, application server, etc..  Each one of these is an opportunity for something to go wrong.  I also have to worry about how my data is getting backed up, how frequently, and a host of other lowlevel details.  Being a startup I dont have the resources for a sysadmin so would have to play one myself.   I currently do some work for a startup and my boss is always talking about how great EC2 is because it lets us get out of the hardware business  in reality though, it doesnt feel that way because we still have to set up the server instances, still have to install software, still have to configure the software properly.  It feels like were still in the hardware business, just that we dont really own the server were using.p  pIn contrast is a service like Heroku which actually uses EC2 underneath, I believe but basically takes care of all the lowlevel details.  They do automatic backups for me, I just specify the frequency.  They have a server configuration already set up.  They have ways to manage it and keep it running so I dont have to monitor traffic.  I can focus on my application and just deploy the code, and let them worry about administration and making sure the database is properly configured with the web server and the right folders have permissions.p  pThe problem with Heroku is obviously that I dont have control over these things if I wanted to modify it.  Heroku uses nginx as its web server if I want to use Phusion Passenger on Apache to stay on the cutting edge of RoR development, Im SOL.  If I need to make a quick patch in production Root of all evil, I know, but it happens sometimes I dont have SSH access to Herokus servers.  If I need to set up a new database user to allow somebody else to remotely access data, I dont think I can do this.  And worst of all if something strongdoesstrong happen with the server, I have no way of doing anything except wait for Heroku to fix it.p  pBasically at what point, if ever, can we as developers focus on our code and application and not have to play sysadmin with server configuration  As a startup with limited resources and limited knowledge of configuring servers enough to get by, would I be better off sacrificing some configurability for the ability to let somebody else worry about the hardwaresoftware end of thingsp

Negative 1709 pIm working on a game like Rodents Revenge, just to point out where Im coming from with this question. Im using the cocos2d game engine aswell...p  pI have a layer that contains about 168 blocks, these blocks are a subclass of a Sprite. Each block contains two instance variables that are integers, one for the xGridLocation and yGridLocation. I have a method that I call that returns an array containing all the blocks that are on the same x or y row as the main character your controlling the mouse. This method works as long as the blocks stay in the same order smallest xy value to largest, but when I start pushing the blocks out of their original row and mixing them up a bit when playing the game my logic no longer works because it is based on the fact that the blocks in the array are indexed from smallest to largest based on their xGridLocation or yGridLocation. The xGridLocation and yGridLocation are not based on their position, when the layer first loads they are given preset grid locations and as the block moves in any direction the grid location is changed based on which direction they moved. p  pMy question is how can I go about sorting the array before its returned in order based on the instance variables xGridLocation or yGridLocation. I was thinking using the sortUsingSelectorselectorcompareValues method but wasnt sure how to go about implementing the compareValues method that will do the sorting.p  pHere is my method I used for getting an array of blocks.p  precodeI have another one for x.

Negative 1709 pFrom ObjectiveC im used to Reference Counting  Retain Counting same thing. I love this concept, and its plain simple.p  pSo I thought, why not apply this to a database The problem isp  pImagine these tables users, photos. A user can own a photo, a user can like a photo of himself or someone else, and a user can recommend a photo. In any case theres a reference created to the photo.p  pNow the big problem is Lets say I want to get rid of any photo that belongs to nobody anymore. So a photo that is not owned by any user, is not liked by any user, and is not recommended by any user, has to be deleted. I have emnoem idea how to do that with the plain database functionality  well, maybe some hundred joins I dont know. Database noob.p  pSo the idea Id like to verify from DB experts Imagine I add a referencecount field to every table which can be referenced requires some thought upon setup, of course. As soon as I define a relationship from any tablea to any tableb, and tablea is supposed to be the parent or master strong reference, I increase the referencecount of the linked row by 1.p  pLets say 150 users like a photo and one owns it. So its referencecount is 151. Now the owner gives it up but 150 others still scream oh nooo, no no no its ours we like it so muuucch. The system looks once every midnight through all these tables and attempts to delete every row which has a reference count of 0. So after some days, the users get bored of it and remove their I like it flag. Every time this happens, the referencecount gets reduced by 1. At the end, its 0, and the next midnight when everyone is asleep, a cron job deletes it.p  pOf course, it must be configurable, because it must not always be the case that the photo has to get deleted after nobody references that anymore. I would solve this by setting its referencecount initially to 1, not 0.p  pThis means of course a lot of additional db calls, I guess. So what do you think Or are there better solutions for thatp

I want to main button to be the size of the view, until other buttons are added and then the view grows appropriately. However, I want the size of the view to be chosen by the user at first...using setFrame I guess. Meaning in the awakeFromNib I cant count on the frame size yet it only take the xib size I assume. So where would I setup my main button  LayoutSubView  setFrame  Im not sure.p
Negative 1709 pI spent some time figuring this out and havent seen others post on it so maybe this will help someone.

I wanted to be able to use all of this as findorcreatebyfullname. Creating a named scope with that name only provides searching its identical to the findbyfullname code above  i.e. it doesnt do what I want. So in order to handle this I created a class method for my User class called findorcreatebyfullnamep  precode This gives us findorcreateby functionality for the fullname virtual attribute.  I put this in my user.rb class. def self.findorcreatebyfullnamename   if found  self.findbyfullnamename.first  Because were using named scope we get back an array     return found   else     created  self.findbyfullnamename.create     return created   end end codepre

Negative 1709 pGamemaker is a neat tool which allows for some good RAD. However it has quite a few shortcomings. One of those is the lack of a good standard library.br True you have the ds type members, but those are quite lacking. The priority queue for example is only a readonce type its destroyed in the process. The sort function for lists uses a terrible slow method. While never officially stated, I suspect it uses bubble sort. And there simply is no build in method for linked lists. On top of that simple member access is slower than it should be.p  pNow one could actually create those things in the native language. However it becomes quite slow as the interpreter is slow. I.e. writing a quicksortheapsort was in many cases slower than the built in sort. Writing my own linked lists using special objects for each node had too much overhead. each object in gamemaker does lots of things each step.p  pSo now Im looking at writing a C layer for the standard library. I hope to add some extra functionality hash tables amp linked lists are the prime target as well as allow for better algorithms. For most of the problems I already have an idea how to tackle it, except for 1 big problemp  pAll C libraries use iterators to identify an item. Gamemaker only allows for doubles or cstyle character arrays to be passed to and from dlls.br How would I circumvent this Not returning the index of an item is quite silly, so I have to find a way to map those iterators into doubles.p  pWhat is a good idea for this Am I best off simply rewriting all datastructures so the iterators are guaranteed to have a 1 on 1 map to double or actually double  datastructure index Or are there better methodsp  pP.s. why isnt the gamemaker tag there yetp

Negative 1709 pSo Im Bitmaping some heavy stuff to try bring down the [prerender] and [render] which is quite high according to FlashBuilders profiling. I emthoughtem this was going well until I realised that as soon as you change a MovieClip to a Bitmap, you lose the pixel based accuracy of the mouse move events Over, Out, Move..., all your left with is the entire bounding box of the Bitmap, something which is less than desirable. Ive got a game where many Bitmapped assets would be on top of each other in a scene, on the stage, arranged in various ways and need to have that pixel accuracy moving between each one and have exhausted my efforts as to how to achieve the same mouse move results with the Bitmapped guys as normal.p  pThis, a hrefhttpseadersforums.appspot.comstaticbitmaps.fla relnofollowhttpseadersforums.appspot.comstaticbitmaps.flaa ,  is a FLA which shows this operation, and you can see how it works here, a hrefhttpseadersforums.appspot.comstaticbitmaps.html relnofollowhttpseadersforums.appspot.comstaticbitmaps.htmla . When it loads up, both items on stage are drawn Shapes, encapsulated in MovieClips, both that get a glow, if you hover over them. If you click the stage at all, the purple guy gets turned into a Bitmap and now, his hit area, when it comes to MouseEvents is his whole bounding box and you can only get through to the back green item at the edge slivers.p  pIm also tracing the pixel which the mouse is over, so I can clearly tell when the mouse is over a transparent area, its 0, but how can I tell the event to forward itself on down the chain to the green MovieClipp  pBelow is how its now pretty much working for me,p  precode        var bitmapBitmap  this[bitmap]         var shouldMouseOverBoolean  bitmap.bitmapData.getPixelevent.localX  bitmap.x, event.localY  bitmap.y         ifshouldMouseOver                      this.mouseOver                  else              this.mouseEnabled  false             var pointPoint  new Pointevent.stageX, event.stageY             for eachvar otherDisplayObject in topContainer.getObjectsUnderPointtopContainer.globalToLocalpoint                              ifother.mouseEnabled                                      point  other.globalToLocalpoint                     other.dispatchEventnew MouseEventMouseEvent.MOUSEMOVE, false, false, point.x, point.y                     break                                           this.mouseEnabled  true          codepre  pI shut off mouseEnabled for my item, when I know its wrong, then I search for another item that properly fits the bill and if there is one, send an Event to that and break.

Negative 1709 pIm working on a prolog assignment and Im currently very very close to the solution.  So, the problem is a constraint satisfaction problem where I have to find values for a set of variables such that certain conditions are true.  Specifically, given 3 words W1,W2,W3, assign their variables such that W1W2W3.  An example of this would be SENDMOREMONEY, or ITISME.  p  pThe constraints are 1 they have to add up correctly, 2 the starting letter cannot be 0 3 and all variables must be distinct.  And it has to work for a general word problem.  My issue is happening when I try to ensure that they add up correctly Ive met the other conditions and I understand the problem.  In terms of the second word problem we should have  p  precode 10I  1T 10I  1S   10M  1E codepre  pSo, I have made a function that makes lists of powers of 10 in a certain length, like sop  precodepowlist1,L      append[1.0],[],L.  powlistN,L      N1 is N1,     X is 10N1,     powlistN1,L1,     append[X],L1,L,     . codepre  pI also have the actual list of letters, say, [I,T,I,S,M,E].  I then constructed a list of coefficients Ill explain that part later out of powlist so we have something like the following [10,1,10,1,10,1].  I did this so if we took the dot product between this list of coefficients and the list of letters, and it was zero, the constraint would be satisfied.  But, I cant get this dot product theory to work.  I currently have a line that says  p  precode   scalarproductCoefficients, Letters, , 0 codepre  pBut this is giving me the following errorp  p Instantiation error in argument 2 of is2br  goal  102 is 010.0109p  pIm not sure how to define dot product so it can work on variables instead of just atoms.

Negative 1709 pIve created a service that runs as the Local System user. This service launches and monitors a Silverlight Outofbrowser application using native interop and the CreateProcessAsUser method to run it as the currently loggedin user, rather than Local System. Im able to get a handle on the spawned Process and do things like Kill it, however, Ive become aware that the service is unable to get a handle to the main window of the child application because the child application is running as a different user. Im running on Windows 7.p  pMy end goal is to respond properly to when the Process stops responding i.e. Process.Responding  false so that I can kill the application and restart it. However, Process.Responding requires a handle to the main window of the process Process.MainWindowHandle, to be exact, however, in this scenario, Process.MainWindowHandle always returns 0.p  pIm stumped here. Is there any way for one user to get a window handle to a process running as another user in Win 7p  pThanks in advance for any and all help.p

Negative 1709 pI am working on a project where I have a set of known measurements x,y,z,a and an input z,a. I need to be able to interpolate the x,y,z so that I can get a list of possible x,y coordinates from a given z.p  pI was looking at bicubic interpolation, but I can only find examples pertaining to regular grids, and my x,y pairs are most certainly not regular.p  pBasically I am looking for some guidance on algorithmsmodels to achieve this goal.

Negative 1709 pBit of an odd one this...p  pLets say I have the following classp  precodepublic class Wibble    public string Foo getset   public string Bar getset  codepre  pThis class is used a process where the values of Foo and Bar are updatedchanged.  However after a certain point in the process I want to lock the instance to prevent any changes from being made.  So the question is how best to do thisp  pA solution of sorts would be something like thisp  precodepublic class Wibble    private string foo   private string bar    public bool Locked get set    public string Foo        get            return this.foo          set              if this.Locked                    throw new ObjectIsLockedException                   this.foo  value            public string Bar        get            return this.bar          set              if this.Locked                    throw new ObjectIsLockedException                   this.bar  value          codepre  pHowever this seems a little inelegant.p  pThe reason for wanting to do this is that I have an application framework that uses externally developed plugins that use the class.  The Wibble class is passed into the plugins however some of them should never change the contents, some of them can.  The intention behind this is to catch development integration issues rather than runtime production issues.  Having the object locked allows is to quickly identify plugins that are not coded as specified.p

For examplep  precodeFooFoostring s, double d, int n  names, weightd, agen       Empty already handled  codepre  pI am curious why Java does not have a similar feature.  According to emCore Java Volume 1emp  blockquote   pC uses this special syntax to call field constructors. In Java, there is no need for it because objects have no subobjects, only pointers to other objects.p blockquote  pHere are my questionsp  ol lipWhat do they mean by because objects have no subobjects I dont understand what a subobject is I tried looking it up do they mean an instantiation of a subclass which extends a superclasspli lipAs for why Java does not have initializer lists like C, I would assume that the reason is because all fields are already initialized by default in Java and also because Java uses the codesupercode keyword to call the superor base in C lingoclass constructor.

You all rockp  pMy problemp  pIm working on a database app that Id like to back up the database at certian points so I can save the data Ive collected in database over time, during development.  So to save the database to accessible memory Ive followed this page p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4202064howcanipulldatabasesoffmyandroidontomydesktopHow can I pull databases off my android onto my desktopap  p..and the above code is working great in the emulator I can use DDMS to pull the copy of the database to my PC and view it using SQLite Database Browser.  However when I run it on an actual device, SQLite Database Browser cant read it.  To extrapolate, the copy is being created just fine on the SD card, but when I copy to my PC from my device and view it, I get nothing, SDB cant understand it or something.  However when I use an emulator, I can copy it off using DDMS and view all the tables just fine with SDB.p  pUsing WinMerge to compare the two raw database files one generated by the device, one generated by the emulator both running the same code I can see there are formatting differences, but nothing that looks corrupted, but Im not 100 sure.  The android metadata and SQL sequence tables appear to be in there albeit in different orders, as well as my custom table.p  pDo you guys have any suggestions on how to debug this  Im not sure where to start since it seems to work perfectly on the emulator.  Also, Ive run the emulator at the same android release 2.3.3 as the device, so Im am empretty sureem they are using the same SQLite engine.p  pThanks, Mattp

Negative 1709 pI have what would seem to be a simple problem but the solutions I have tried to date have left me wanting in the execution areas. Speeds seem fine on small lt10000 data sets but quickly take more and more time as the counts go up.p  pIn SQL Server 2008 R2 I have a table with four columns in it Id, ParentId, ControlNum, ParentControlNum.p  pThe Id and ParentId information is filled in. An Id always has a value, the ParentId is null if the row has no parent, otherwise its the the value of an Id within the table that represents the parent row.p  pThe issue is that the Id and ParentIds are all over the place. All of the Ids are added to the table then they are processed to add the children. This is a set part of the problem and is not something that can be changed.p  pWhat I need to be able to do is to generate the ControlNum values in order obeying the Parent Child relationship. My current logic uses a bit of C and SQL SELECTUPDATE commands to accomplish this, but as mentioned performance is a great concern.p  pIn PseudoCodep  precodeSelect all Ids where the parent Id is null All root entries Foreach Id    GenerateControlNumId, CurrentCounterValue, CurrentCounterValue  GenerateControlNumId, CurrentCounterValue, ParentCounterValue     Set Ids ControlNum to CurrentCounterValue     Set Ids ParentControlNum to CurrentCounterValue      Increment CurrentCounterValue      Select All Ids where ParentId  Id All my direct children     Foreach ChildId         GenerateControlNumChildId, CurrentCounterValue, Ids ControlNum codepre  pBaseline is trying to make this execute faster, idealy completely in SQL would be preffered. I am trying along the lines of a CTE populated with the RootIds and then going through them with a MERGE statement but I can just not seem to get the counter value to work properly for setting the ControlNum values.p  pIs this even possible in SQL or is this too much of a procedural type of processingp  pExample Table Data from how it currently runs BEFOREp  precodeID                                      ParentId                                ControlNum  ParentControlNum 8C821027A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    756F981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL D7DB6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    756F981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL D2E36033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    C9E36033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL 8FE66033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    58E66033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL 37EC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    2FEC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL 41EC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    2FEC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL  DDED6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    BCED6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    0           NULL DC69981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL 166A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL 4D6A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL 856A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL F56A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL 2E6B981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL 666B981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL 9D6B981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           NULL codepre  pAFTERp  precodeID                                      ParentId                                ControlNum  ParentControlNum 8C821027A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    756F981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    22          21 D7DB6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    756F981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    24          21 D2E36033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    C9E36033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    58          57 8FE66033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    58E66033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    69          68 37EC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    2FEC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    86          85 41EC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    2FEC6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    88          85 DDED6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    BCED6033A6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    95          94 DC69981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    0           0 166A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    1           1 4D6A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    2           2 856A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    3           3 F56A981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    4           4 2E6B981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    5           5 666B981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    6           6 9D6B981EA6F9E011AB48B499BAE13A62    NULL                                    7           7 codepre  pThe data set I have is 104 entries right now so this is just the first 15.

Negative 1709 pim writing a c program with a topmost window so you dont have any default way of resizing, or at least not to my knowledge.

Negative 1709 pI SEEM to be having an issue with GlobalLock in my application.

Negative 1709 pMy project has a reporting module that gathers data from the database in the form of XML and runs an XSLT on it to generate the users desired format of report.

This is unacceptable.p  pIt seems that the problem is simply too much data, but I cant help but think there is a better way to deal with this than limiting the customer and not being able to meet functional requirements.p  pI am glad to give more information as needed, but I cannot disclose too much about the project as Im sure most of you understand.

Basically what I want is something like this...p  precodeprivate void UserControlLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      Call command from viewmodel  codepre  pLooking around I cant seem to find the syntax for this anywhere.

Negative 1709 pGood morning all,p  pIm having some issues with floating point math, and have gotten totally lost in .tofs, 100s and .0sp  pI was hoping someone could help me with my specific problem, and also explain exactly why their solution works so that I understand this for next time.p  pMy program needs to do two thingsp  ol liSum a list of decimals, determine if they sum to exactly 1.0li liDetermine a difference between 1.0 and a sum of numbers  set the value of a variable to the exact difference to make the sum equal 1.0.li ol  pFor examplep  ol lip[0.28, 0.55, 0.17]  should sum to 1.0, however I keep getting 1.xxxxxx.  I am implementing the sum in the following fashionp  precodesum  array.inject0.0sum,x sum x100  100 codepreli lipThe reason I need this functionality is that Im reading in a set of decimals that come from excel.  They are not 100 precise they are lacking some decimal points so the sum usually comes out of 0.999999xxxxx or 1.000xxxxx.  For example, I will get values like the followingp  precode0.568887955,0.070564759,0.360547286 codepreli ol  pTo fix this, I am ok taking the sum of the first n1 numbers, and then changing the final number slightly so that all of the numbers together sum to 1.0 must meet validation using the equation above, or whatever I end up with.  Im currently implementing this as followsp  precode          sum  0.0           array.each do item             sum  item  100.0           end           array[i]  100  sum.round100.0 codepre  pI know I could do this with inject, but was trying to play with it to see what works.  I think this is generally working from inspecting the output, but it doesnt always meet the validation sum above.  So if need be I can adjust this one as well.  Note that I only need two decimal precision in these numbers  i.e. 0.56 not 0.5623225.  I can either round them down at time of presentation, or during this calculation... It doesnt matter to me.p  pThank you VERY MUCH for your helpp

Operations admins cant say what might have changed that would cause the problem.p  pThe client application uses a hardcoded connection string with Integrated SecurityTrue, but when the applications attempts to create a connection to the database, it throws an SQLException saying Login failed for user NT AUTHORITYANONYMOUS LOGON.p  pI can log on to the database through Management Studio on this account without problem.  All of the things that I have seen for this issue are for ASP.NET projects and it is apparently the Double Hop Problem which being a client application darned well better not be a problem.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  h2Edith2  pThe client machine and server machine as well as user accounts are on the same domain. This occurs when Windows Firewall is off.p  pLeading theory is Server was restarted about a week or so ago, and failed to register Service Principal Name SPN.  Failure to register an SPN may cause integrated authentication to fall back to NTLM instead of Kerberos.p

Negative 1709 pThe other day I was converting a program written with C99 standard into C11. Basically the motive was to use the code with MSVC but It was written in Linux and was mostly compiled with default GCC behaviour. During the code conversion, I found out that you can not decalre variables of a function after any statement i.e. you must declare them at the top of the function. p  pBut my question is that wouldnt it be against the efficient programming rule that variables should be declared near their use so that it maximizes the cache hits For example, In a large function of say 200 LOC, I want to use some big static look up array at nearly the end of the function. Wouldnt declaring and initializing it just before the usage cause more cache hits  or am I simple missing some basic point of C11 C language standardp
Negative 1709 pMy original python program used string interpolation to take a number a user enters between 09999 like 2928, and summed its individual digits 292821, and then split the number until eventually it became a single digit number in this case 3, which was displayed on the screen. The code looks like thisp  pNow I am needing to figure out a way to do the same without using string interpolationconverting the integers to strings and then splitting the strings, reconverting them to integers, and summing them. I am fairly new to python and therefore can use very simple commands most complex being the while loop can anyone help me out throw me some ideas p  pps, I guess some ambiguity exists as to what yearint year is. year is a command that i didnt write above but its code makes the user enter a number between 09999. I changed its variable name to yearint because I am new to python and want to make things descriptive so I can remember them when I look back. SO basically yearyearint are the input the user inputs.p
Negative 1709 pI have some code for drawing polygons edges that is supposed to draw, for example, in a triangle with vertices 0, 1, and 2, the edges 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, 0.

I have looked this over and suspect that the problem could be in my indexing here, but if everything depends on j, I would think that maybe vertices.size is messed up.

Negative 1709 pI am working on my project this year and my task is to create an iPhone app that will interact with campus buildings. I am running iOS6 and for this reason I cant use Apple Maps. After hours of search I found MapQuestOSM. At the moment, I have achieved to draw an Overlay on a building, but this requires a lot of time, in order to find and pass the correct latlng. In the past I have worked on an Android phone and I was using KML files to draw routes etc. Until now, I cant find anything similar for MapQuest points slightly differs from Google Maps. p  pDo anyone knows an efficiency way to retrieve exact latlng points for a building and draw its Overlay using MapQuest It is important to achieve that, because my main goal is to make that building or area clickable for the user.

Negative 1709 pIs there an equivalent to the blitz library for strings i.e. a library which improves performance of string constructionmanipulation by delaying string building until the whole expression is readp  pBlitz improves the speed of matrixvector operations by template metaprogramming, constructing a syntax tree at compile time from expressions like codeA  B  Ccode and then evaluating the syntax tree. This method could, for example, improve the performance of string concatenation, since after having seen an expression like codes1  s2  s3code, the size of the result will be known, such that then memory allocation and copying can be done in one step, rather than first allocating memory for codes1  s2code, copying, allocating memory for codes1  s2  s3code, and then copying again.p

Negative 1709 pI have a recursive polling function that does some stuff and then calls itself with a setTimeout of 100 ms. However, if I call another synchronous function that does some stuff for a long time while the recursive polling function is running, I assume the function called with a setTimeout of 100ms will be queued, but if that long function does not return within a specified amount of time, will the browser simply discard the queued function Im asking this because it seems that the recursive polling function stops running after this other long running function is called. Also I checked with codeconsole.logcodes that the recursive function reaches and calls the setTimeout but the function passed to setTimeout never is called after the long synchronous function is called. This is all in Chrome 23 and Firefox 15.p

I have been loading the images for the topic by NSString topicName.p  pNow the problem comes in the German version of the application. topicName variable is now in German, Spielzeuge, and of course the image is not loading, because there is no Spielzeuge.png in my bundle.p  pI know I could have duplicated my images to have both English and German versions and it would work, but is there a way to use the same images for both the languages without duplicating themp  pThanksp

Negative 1709 pOver a year ago we added an a hrefhttpwww.remobjects.comtvvideo pagea on our site. At the time OGV wasnt very good, and there was no good WebM encoders available, so we decided to use HTML5 and h.264 for webkit browsers Chrome, Safari, etc. and then fallback to Flash for other browsers using the same h.264 source file. p  pThis has been working great for a while. Recently month or two maybe, so over multiple Chrome versions  currently Version 24.0.1312.52 m we discovered Chrome really lagging on the playback. We thought it was a server issue, so we upgraded the server, and it is still behaving the same. I remembered reading that Google wanted to drop h.264 and move everyone to WebM, and thought this performance was part of that. We converted some videos to WebM and tested them with Chrome and they lag just as bad. Same video WebM streams beautifully in FireFox, and the MP4 streams great in FireFox via the Flash plug in.p  pI went to YouTube and turned on the HTML5 video support, and found the videos to lag in Chrome too when running at HD while they play fine in Flash mode. Even when HTML5 is enabled, some videos still play via Flash.p  pTested on both Windows 8 and Mountain Lion.p  pIve talked to coworkers and they are seeing the same issues. So it isnt just me. So my question is p  ol liIs this an issue with our video encodingli liIs it a bug with Chromeli liOr is it just localized to usli liIs there a way to deal with this besides switching back to Flashli ol

The proposed method is to calculate maximum reprojection error for inliers and compare it with a threshold.

Negative 1709 pIm using the plugins coderegisterDevicecode and codeunregisterDevicecode methods and looking at my apps control panel in pushwoosh. My apps preference defaults to accepting push notifications, so I register, that works and my subscriber count increments in pushwoosh control panel. It also fires a codepushnotificationcode event where the event has the codenotificationcode property as the guide shows, but its set to codenullcode. This is confusing as I have not yet sent any push notifications from the control panel.p  pI then set my push preference to codefalsecode and unregister the the device. It works because my subscriber count decrements in the control panel, but the codefailcode callback is the one that fires, and the only argument it gets is the same push token string that the register codesuccesscode callback got. If I unregister again after that, still only the codefailcode callback fires but this time the only argument is the empty string.p  pAm I doing something wrong with handling responses from the pluginp  pThe code Im testing withp  precodefunction      document.onpushnotification, functionevt          var n  evt.originalEvent.notification         console.logn           var pushPrefApply  function          app.pushPreffunctionpushPref              console.logpushPref, pushPref             if pushPref                  window.plugins.pushNotification.unregisterDevice                     function                          console.logunreg ok, arguments                     ,                     function                          console.logunreg fail, arguments                                                       return                          window.plugins.pushNotification.registerDevice                                      projectid 123456789012,                     appid  F0000BAAAA                 ,                 functionpushToken                      console.logreg ok, arguments                 ,                 functionstatus                      console.logreg fail, arguments                                                  code for changinginitiating push preference goes here  codepre  pcodedocumentcode is not a typo, its defined already. codeapp.pushPrefcode is the preference settingfetching function. codewindow.plugins.pushNotification.onDeviceReadycode has been done elsewhere on codedevicereadycode.p  pIm hoping the pushwoosh devs will shed some light on this.p

Negative 1709 pI have a database table that lists all orders. Each weekend a cron runs and it generates invoices for each customer.

I run it again and 1 order is updated, I repeat the process and each time only a small number of orders are updated  between 1 and 3. It doesnt update the 60 in one query as I would expect.

Negative 1709 pHi I have one question regarding some type casting approaches. I am translating some Delphi files to C. I have delphi declaration of class which is derived from TList and its a base class for other derived classes. p  precodetype TBaseItem  class TObject public   procedure SomeProcedure virtual abstract end  Type TBaseClass  classTList private    function GetItemIndex Integer TBaseItem   procedure SetItemValue TBaseItem Index Integer public   property Items[Index Integer] TBaseItem read GetItem write SetItem end   function TBaseClass.GetItemIndex Integer TBaseItem begin   Result  TBaseIteminherited Items[Index] end  procedure TBaseClass.SetItemValue TBaseItem Index Integer begin   inherited Items[Index]  Value end codepre  pThis are two base classe TBaseItem and TBaseClass. So here are declared new classes TchildItem which is derived from TBaseItem and TChildClass which is derived from TBaseClass. TChildItem is overriding method SomeMethod and what is more important is that TChildtClass is overriding property Items in a way that now we are returning TParentItem items insted of TBaseItem.p  precodetype TChildItem  class TBaseItem public   procedure SomeProcedure override end  type TChildClass  classTBaseClass private    function GetItemIndex Integer TChildItem   procedure SetItemValue TChildItem Index Integer public   property Items[Index Integer] TChildItemread GetItem write SetItem end  function TChildClass .GetItemIndex Integer TChildItem begin   Result  TChildIteminherited Items[Index] end  procedure TChildClass.SetItemValue TChildItem Index Integer begin   inherited Items[Index]  Value end codepre  pWith this example I wanted to show how easy can be done deriving classes and overriding properties. Getting proper type of item out of a list is simply done by calling parents base property Item and typecast it to proper type. This is delphi apporach.p  pI wonder how can I translate this part of code to C. Currently I declared a new base class which is not derived from any class and it has public var Items which is p  precodeclass TBaseItem   virtual void SomeMethod   class TBaseClass  public   vectorltTBaseItemgt Items     class TChildItem  public TBaseItem   class TChildClass  public TBaseClass   codepre  pand then use p  precodereturn TChildItem Items[Idx] codepre  pThat means I would like to access parents TBaseClass public variables such as that vector Items and typecast it to proper type... My first impression is that I might be going into wrong direction with that Delphi approach.p  pWhat do you suggest How should I go with thatp  pTHANK YOU VERY MUCHp

For example, the PathView object documentation at a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qmlpathview.html relnofollowhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qmlpathview.htmla doesnt say what properties its model needs to support. Moreover, the ListModel documentation isnt definitive  it doesnt state exactly what properties the ListModel supports and theres no clear documentation on how precisely a QList satisfies those requirements and how it doesnt.p  pUPDATE Ive tried this with Qt 5 on Windows, and Im still having the same problem.p

Negative 1709 pI have a set of integers in C03, where the integers represent guesses relative to a reference point.  The algorithm runs through a long list of items, and for each item, it tries each integer guess an expensive operation relative to the reference point of that item until it finds a match or all the guesses are exhausted.  An item matches at most one guess, but may match none.  I would like to count the number of times each relative integer guess successfully finds a match such that on each next item being iterated over, the set of guesses for that item is ordered such that those guesses with the most success come before those with less success based on the items already processed.p  pI could imagine using a stdmap that maps each relative guess to the number of times that relative guess has successfully found a match.  With that, on each items iteration, I could reverse the map and multimap all the maps values backwards to their keys.  Iterating over the second multimap in reverse, I could process the guesses on each item, starting with the most successful guesses downward until a match is found. At this point the first map would be updated to indicate which guess now has one more success.  Similarly, the second multimap would be updated to remove the matching guess from its old success count and reinserting it in its now incremented success count.p  pHowever, this seems complex and I imagine there is a more elegant answer.  Although, perhaps it is worth the wasted effort to make the code simpler to understand by rebuilding the multimap from scratch each iteration instead of trying to incrementally maintain itp  pIs there a known design pattern data structure that fits well to this problem  How can I best order my guesses such that more successful guesses bubble up to the top  Does it make sense to apply a priority queue herep
Negative 1709 pWhen I program using LINQ with a .dbml file, there is only one context.

Negative 1709 pWe are running a web application and switched from memcached to redis 2.4 for caching. Now we are somewhat disappointed about redis performance. Redis is running on the same server and we use only very simple GET and SET operations. On some requests which make heavy use of cached values we have up to 300 GET requests to redis, but those requests take up to 150ms. We have about 200,000 active keys, and about 1,000 redis requests per second. There is no problem with disk io, ram or cpu. Because of our existing code we cant simply group redis requests together. Memcached has been about 4 times faster. What we like about redis, is that we dont need any cache warming, and could use more advanced datastore features in future. We expected redis to perform similar to memcached. So perhaps we missed something in our configuration, which is basically the default configuration.p  pstrongDo you know of any best practice for redis performance tuningstrongp

Negative 1709 pedit edited for what I hope is clarityp  pTheres a GUI application that has a single main window. That main window has text in its title bar I was tasked to retrieve the text in the main window title bar. p  pNormally, if an user is logged in, the application starts just fine and I can grab the title of main window using a PowerShell, by invoking System.Diagnostic.Process.MainWindowTitle, no problem.p  pHowever, I need to grab this same information when no user is logged in. I intended to write a script or a small console application that would be launched by the task scheduler to do so. Its strange, I know I need to start this application when no user is logged on the system, and retrieve the text in the title bar of its sole main window.p  pI know that when no user is logged in, the task scheduler will obviously still dutifully try to run scripts or executables. However, because no user is logged, these scheduled executables or scripts will not have access to the Windows emGUI subsystemem. Therefore, if a scheduled task tries to start an application requiring a window to be drawn, well, that window wont be drawn. p  pThis means I cant simply schedule a script that will launch this GUI application, get the text in the tile bar and then kill the application I cant do this because the application will never have its main window drawn.p  pI have some ideas and I was hoping for input on them or even another alternativesp  ul lipEasiest yet the least desirable, I would try to force an user logon even though there is no actual user. This should load the emGUI subsystemem and display the main window. Id log off again after grabbing the text of the main window title. pli lipAt some point, the application will invoke some Windows API asking for a window to be drawn which will not be drawn because of the previously mentioned lacking emGUI subsystemem. Maybe I could somehow capture this request and maybe within this request, I could find the main window title Or a pointer to point in memory Somethingpli lipThis seems the less doable but maybe I could establish a RDP to the machine itself. My thinking is that when you RDP into a headless server for example, the server is producing the visual elements that its sending back to the client. Therefore, when an RDP connection is made, the emGUI subsystemem should be active to draw the elements that need to be sent back. In my case, the elements arent sent anywhere but Im hoping they will still be created so I can grab the window text.pli ul  pLast, I want to specify I already tried parsing the binary for strings, in the hope of finding the information from the main window title stored in the binary when compiled. However, its not reliable enough to be used consistently. p  pAwesome if anyone actually reached the end of this wallotext and thanks if you did. Ill take solutions in any languages but Im best at C and C.p

Negative 1709 pIm trying to write a PHP program that uses the IMAP PHP extension to run through a very large inbox greater than 70,000 emails, and move all emails that fall within a specified date range into a folder.  I keep running into problems trying to get the mail that falls within the desired range.  p  pFirst I tried using the SINCE and BEFORE criteria in imapsearch to place all of the desired ID numbers into an array, and then created a string listing these ID numbers to feed into imapmailmove.  But the problem I keep running into is that imapsearch never actually returns all of the emails within the specified range.  For instance, I ran the following codep  precode    echo Beginning search. n     mail  imapsearchthisgtmbox,                     SINCE startDate BEFORE endDate     echo Search complete. n     if mailecho The inbox is empty. n die      count  0     foreachmail as i              count  count  1          echo Found count emails. n codepre  pwhile specifying a date range that I know to hold 600ish emails, and imapsearch only listed 259 of them.  When I expanded the range to encompass the entire inbox of about 75,000 emails, imapsearch only returned 25,112 of them.  p  pWhen this didnt work, I tried a different, slower way to get all emails within the desired date range.  I used imapsearch to collect ALL emails in the inbox, then I iterated through each email, compared the date contained in the emails header to the dates definining my interval, and added the ID to a string if it was in range.  I ran the following codep  precode     Get all mail in the INBOX     mail  imapsearchthisgtmbox, ALL     if mailecho The inbox is empty. n die       Create a string list of all message IDs      that fall in the specified range     processed  0     IDsequence       foreachmail as messageID              date  imapheaderinfothisgtmbox, messageIDgtdate         try dateObject  new DateTimedate         catch Exception e echo egtgetMessage echo n         dateObjectgtsetTimezoneTimeZone          if dateObject lt IntervalEndDate ampamp dateObject gt                           IntervalStartDate                      IDsequence  IDsequence . , . strvalmessageID                  processed  processed  1         if processed  100  0          echo Processed processed emails. n             If we got at least one message, cut off the first comma.     if strlenIDsequence gt 1         IDsequence  substrIDsequence, 1, strlenIDsequence1          else              echo No email to move. n         die          echo Beginning copy. n     imapmailcopythisgtmbox, IDsequence, TargetFolder     echo Copy complete. n     imapexpungethisgtmbox     imapclosethisgtmbox codepre  pAfter iterating through just over 25,000 emails, it began to print the error message  object does not exist referencing the line of code where I collect the date from the email header.

I suspect that I am doing something wrong with the message IDs for instance, I am assuming that the message IDs for the 75,000 emails are 1 through 75,000.p  pWhat is going wrong  Is there a way to collect a large number of emails that fall within a date range and move themp

Negative 1709 pI have a questions about recommended coding technique. I have a tool for model analysis and I sometimes need to pass a big amount of data From a factory class to one that holds multiple heterogeneous chunks. p  pMy question is whether there is some consensus about if I should rather use pointers or move the ownership I need to avoid copying when possible as the size of a datablock may be as big as 1 GB.p  pThe pointer version would look like thisp  precodeclass FactoryClass  ... public    static Data  createData        Data  data  new Data       ...       return data       class StorageClass     uniqueptrltDatagt dataptr ... public    void setDataData  dataptr        dataptr.resetdataptr       void pass     Data  data  FactoryClasscreateData    ...    StorageClass storage    storage.setDatadata  codepre  pWhereas the move version is like thisp  precodeclass FactoryClass  ... public    static Data createData        Data data       ...       return data       class StorageClass     Data data ... public    void setDataData data        data  movedata       void pass     Data data  FactoryClasscreateData    ...    StorageClass storage    storage.setDatamovedata  codepre  pI like the move version better  yes, I need to add move commands to the main code, but then I in the end have just the objects in the storage and I do not have to care about pointer semantics anymore. p  pHowever I am not quite relaxed when using the move semantics whom I do not understand in detail. I do not care about the C11 requirement though, as the code is already only Gcc4.7 compilable.p  pWould someone have a reference that would support either version Or is there some other, preferred version of how to pass data p  pI was not able to Google anything as the keywords usually led to other topics.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT NOTE The second example got refactored to incorporate suggestions from the comments, the semantics remained unchanged.p

Negative 1709 pI need to plot a 3d surface from a file and then plot a line from a different file over that surface.

No sign of the trajectory even on rotating and reorienting the surface. p  pIve tried reversing the plot order surface first and then trajectory but that doesnt work either. p  pI also tried putting a zaxis offset to the trajectory to check that it was not a case of the surface being plotted on top of the trajectory. This failed too. p  pAny ideas on how to proceed Ive trawled through the gnuplot help files and theres no example or case that helps. Im well and truly stuck.

Negative 1709 pI think some of my activitys within my app are leaking memory. I tried following Activity A is the launcheractiviy and takes 23,5MB total memory dalviknative. When I start activity B from A my app takes about 4 more MB 27,5MB. If I start activity C from A my app takes about 4 more MB 27,5MB, too. Thus, if I start both activitys about 7 MBs are taken 30,5MB.  Now Im doing following Astart B from A start C from B finish B. The expected amount of memory which is additionally taken is about 4MBs 27,5MB, but my app actually consumes overall 7 more MBs 30,5MB. Why does this happen p  pthx amp regardsp  pPS Im using Little Eye to analyse the memory usage of my app. All data are representing total memoryvalues dalvik  native. If I just do Astart B from A finish B no memory is released after step 3. p

Negative 1709 pIm really enjoying Marionette and the structure it adds to Backbone. However, Im a little stumped with how to reuse a Module on a single page.p  pI have a Marionette Module that renders and handles events for a category tree. I would like to reuse this Module on the same page, that would display different collections in different regions in the page. I came to realize that the Marionette Modules are essentially singletons on the Application object, which is also a singleton. I apparently cant create a new instance of a Module to display and handle events for a new collection in a different region. Likewise, I cant register and trigger events on the Module, because there is only one and the events triggered in each region would need to be independent of each other.p  pAm I thinking about Modules incorrectly How can they reused on the same page with different regions  collectionsp

Because even if my async blocks checks on main thread if app is still in foreground, when I continue async to do complex drawing 3 nanoseconds later app could be in background state and CRASH.p  pSo even if I check canRender on main thread before every single gl function call it could be that a split nanosecond later app is in background and crash.p  pIs there a way to shut down OpenGL from inside out so it ignores calls to its functions.

Negative 1709 pnot sure even where to start on this.  i have an excel workbook with tabs for different tracking sheets.  some for maintenance tracking and some for personnel work hours for different jobs.  it is very time consuming to pull, copy and paste the results i need and then compare them.  i already know that an access database would be a better product to use for tracking and pulling results together, however my boss always favors excel and does not want to get rid of the current products used by myself, the boss and a hand full of others in the office.  so i already know what needs to be converted to a database but have my hands tied for the time being.p  pso here is what i am trying to accomplish.  my boss has set up macros for several of the excel sheets to archive the days worth of results in maintenance and workers hours spent doing jobs.  what it currently does is, makes a copy of the sheet and saves that sheet to a network folder for us to look at if we have a problem and need to check results.  i would like to recode the macro to instead save those results to records in an access table.  some of the info is missing and would need to be created on the fly as the record is created.  because the sheet tracks only results for the day, there is no column in the excel sheet for the date.  so the date will have to be added to the record as it is created, which is usually yesterdays date.  results get fed into the excel sheet and stay until the next morning when we hit the archive macro button to save yesterdays results to an excel.xls file.p  phere is a screen shot of the sheet. a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B6m3joiltLjZFFjSmI3ek9iYk0edituspsharing relnofollowdispatch logap  pso when i try to bring all the days together i have to copy and paste from multiple xls files to one just to get the stats i need.  i know my way around access better then i do excel so this would be a great time saver for me.  if i could change the archive code to populate an access table would be great help.  anybody got any ideas  thanks in advance for helping me.p  pcode used to archive the excel sheet.p  precodeSheetsDISPATCH LOG.Select ActiveSheet.Copy Set WB  ActiveWorkbook  FileName  FormatNow, yyyymmdd On Error Resume Next Kill YDispatchArchive amp FileName On Error GoTo 0 WB.SaveAs FileNameYDispatchArchive amp FileName      Delete the temporary file WB.ChangeFileAccess ModexlReadOnly WB.Close SaveChangesTrue codepre

Negative 1709 pThis is not a question really, but a guide in some sense. I did not find a better place to post it. I hope someone finds this helpful.p  pI was fed up with stopping and starting node.js application to pick up code changes. So I wanted a strongsolution withoutstrong too much hassle and stronginstallation of additional plugins, packages or anything elsestrong. The pure solution using standard Aptana Studio 3.4 Eclipse features on Windows 8.1 x64 as followsp  ol liRightclick on your project in emProject Explorerem  Properties  Buildersli liNew...

You have to doublecheck.li ol  pSo if you have not changed too many default preferences in Aptana Studio 3Eclipse by saving a file within your project should trigger its builders. First builder will kill existing instance to overcome port already in use exception and start an application again. emConsoleem tab related to that process should pop up.p  pThis works perfectly for me developing one node.js project at a time and medium size application restarts instantly. There is still space for improvements, e.g. killing just that particular instance instead of all. Suggestions are welcome except the ones to install Nodeclipse or node.js packages, etc.p  pI hope this easy to do solution will help someone. Also I hope Aptana Studio 3 will start supporting node.js type of projectsserver natively very soon.p
Negative 1709 pemstrongShort questionemstrong is the selectors API sensible for processing XML documentsp  pemstrongLonger question with the why Im asking...br emstrong Im in the progress of making some old code that makes use of clientside generated XML and XPath into something crossbrowser thats happy on later versions of IE 10 as well as down to IE7 as well as Chrome, Firefox, etc...p  pNow theres a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq19300859130352variousa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq13521554130352questionsa around XPath support in IE and the fact it appears to be no longer cared for no codeevaluatecode, no codeSelectNodescode. Allegedly a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combieinternalsarchive20120926windows8internetexplorer10activexcontrolchangesandrestrictions.aspx relnofollowsome classes have been whitelisteda, but some testing seems to hint this is unreliable when ActiveX filtering is enabled in IE10.p  pIve played with wickedgoodxpath, but Ive bumped into issues with some forms of XPath. In addition if IE is never going to have XPath support again, Id rather not be permenantly reliant on an external library, and find the next best thing to use instead.p  pIts been pointed out that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3841239130352the selector API is now the recommended choicea instead. The problem I have with this though is that it primarily appears to be a HTML selection API mostly as it grew out of CSS and as such it has special cases for class and ID attributes  there maybe other HTMLisms Ive not yet seen.p  pThus is the selectors API sensible for processing XML documents Given the lack of support in IE, the answer is probably yes, but I cant see anything authoritative that gives a definite recommendation or antirecommendation.p

Negative 1709 pI am developing a very largecomplex Single Page Application and Im experimenting with different techniques to speed up my performance. p  pMy app makes use of many ui widgets both from jquery ui, and the jqWidgets library, and currently I load all the html and initialize all the widgets upon pageload regardless of whether the widget is used, i.e. popup windows are initialized and remain hidden until called upon.p  pI realized that I could save some resources by only loading the widgets that the user is going use, right before they are needed, pretty standard. So I basically have two choices herep  pstrong1.strong I can move all the HTML into a javascript file that injects appends the relevant html, then initializes the widget right before the call to the widget, something like thisp  precodewidgetWrapper.appendltdiv idnewWidgetIDgtltdivgt newWidgetID.methodToCreateWidget codepre  pstrong2.strong I can do basically the same as above, except retrieve the HTML from the server via ajax.p  pstrongProsConsstrongp  pI am not well versed on clientserver performance but I see some obvious pros and cons here, by moving the HTML into a javascript file that does all my DOM manipulations, I am not decreasing the amount of data that my site requires on pageload, im only shifting the data from the html body, to a js file, BUT I am DRASTICALLY reducing the number of initial DOM elements.p  pMy only fear of method strong2strong is that a slow clientserver connection might cause a non trivial delay in my ui response time.p  pAre there any suggestions on how to tackle this issue Im heavily leaning towards method strong1strong, what are the industry standards Or should I just say to hell with it and go ahead and load and init everything upfront long wait at login, but fast ui response and hope that browsers continue to make leaps and bounds in the area of JS performance with the exception of IE of course.p

Negative 1709 h2The Contexth2  pI am using the codesubprocesscode module to start a process from python. I want to be able to access the output stdout, stderr as soon as it is writtenbuffered. p  ul liThe solution must support Windows 7. I require a solution for Unix systems too but I suspect the Windows case is more difficult to solve. li liThe solution should support Python 2.6. I am currently restricted to Python 2.6 but solutions using later versions of Python are still appreciated. li liThe solution should not use third party libraries. Ideally I would love a solution using the standard library but I am open to suggestions.li liThe solution must work for just about any process. Assume there is no control over the process being executed.  li ul  h2The Child Processh2  pFor example, imagine I want to run a python file called codecounter.pycode via a codesubprocesscode. The contents of codecounter.pycode is as followsp  precodeimport sys  for index in range10       Write data to standard out.     sys.stdout.writestrindex       Push buffered data to disk.     sys.stdout.flush codepre  h2The Parent Processh2  pThe parent process responsible for executing the codecounter.pycode example is as followsp  precodeimport subprocess  command  [python, counter.py]  process  subprocess.Popen     cmd,     bufsize1,     stdoutsubprocess.PIPE,     stderrsubprocess.PIPE,       codepre  h2The Issueh2  pUsing the codecounter.pycode example I can access the data before the process has completed. This is great This is exactly what I want. However, removing the codesys.stdout.flushcode call prevents the data from being accessed at the time I want it. This is bad This is exactly what I dont want. My understanding is that the codeflushcode call forces the data to be written to disk and before the data is written to disk it exists only in a buffer. Remember I want to be able to run just about any process. I do not expect the process to perform this kind of flushing but I still expect the data to be available in real time or close to it. Is there a way to achieve thisp  pA quick note about the parent process. You may notice I am using codebufsize0code for line buffering. I was hoping this would cause a flush to disk for every line but it doesnt seem to work that way. How does this argument work p  pYou will also notice I am using codesubprocess.PIPEcode. This is because it appears to be the only value which produces IO objects between the parent and child processes. I have come to this conclusion by looking at the codePopen.gethandlescode method in the codesubprocesscode module Im referring to the Windows definition here. There are two important variables, codec2preadcode and codec2pwritecode which are set based on the codestdoutcode value passed to the codePopencode constructor. For instance, if codestdoutcode is not set, the codec2preadcode variable is not set. This is also the case when using file descriptors and filelike objects. I dont really know whether this is significant or not but my gut instinct tells me I would want both read and write IO objects for what I am trying to achieve  this is why I chose codesubprocess.PIPEcode. I would be very grateful if someone could explain this in more detail. Likewise, if there is a compelling reason to use something other than codesubprocess.PIPEcode I am all ears.p  h2Method For Retrieving Data From The Child Processh2  precodeimport time import subprocess import threading import Queue   class StreamReaderthreading.Thread          Threaded object used for reading process output stream stdout, stderr.              def initself, stream, queue, args, kwargs         superStreamReader, self.initargs, kwargs         self.stream  stream         self.queue  queue           Event used to terminate thread.

Nothing more to read. Stop reader thread. stdoutreader.stop codepre  pHere I am performing the logic which reads standard out from the child process in a thread. This allows for the scenario in which the read is blocking until data is available. Instead of waiting for some potentially long period of time, we check whether there is available data, to be read within a time out period, and continue looping if there is not.p  pI have also tried another approach using a kind of nonblocking read. This approach uses the codectypescode module to access Windows system calls. Please note that I dont fully understand what I am doing here  I have simply tried to make sense of some example code I have seen in other posts. In any case, the following snippet doesnt solve the buffering issue. My understanding is that its just another way to combat a potentially long read time. p  precodeimport os import subprocess  import ctypes import ctypes.wintypes import msvcrt  cmd  [python, counter.py]  process  subprocess.Popen     cmd,     bufsize1,     stdoutsubprocess.PIPE,        def readoutputnonblockingstream     data       availablebytes  0      cread  ctypes.culong     cavailable  ctypes.culong     cmessage  ctypes.culong      fileno  stream.fileno     handle  msvcrt.getosfhandlefileno       Read available data.     buffer  None     bytes  0     status  ctypes.windll.kernel32.PeekNamedPipe         handle,         buffer,         bytes,         ctypes.byrefcread,         ctypes.byrefcavailable,         ctypes.byrefcmessage,               if status         availablebytes  intcavailable.value      if availablebytes gt 0         data  os.readfileno, availablebytes         print data      return data  while True       Read standard out for child process.     stdout  readoutputnonblockingprocess.stdout     print stdout       Check whether child process is still active.     if process.poll  None           Process is no longer active.         break codepre  pComments are much appreciated. p  pCheersp

It didnt look good and the images etc. on the page were reloaded every time.

Negative 1709 pIm having a problem which I wanted to solve with temporary tables, however, I discovered this is not really a good approach in Oracle.p  pI issue a select command from multiple tables and get Result1.

Negative 1709 pIve figured out how to shuffle a list, but the function seems to shuffle everything but the original first item.p  pMy codep  precodefrom random import shuffle  x  listrange10 print x  k  0 while k lt lenx     for i in x         shufflex         print i         k  k  1 codepre  pThe reason Im using a forloop within a whileloop is that I want the iteration through the list to eventually end, and Im not sure if this can be done within the forloop itself.p  pRunning the code will result in print the original list, then 10 printouts, each an item of the list. The first item printed is always 0, or in other words, it is always the first item in the original list. I cant figure out why this is happening, perhaps because the item has already been selected before the shuffle function is called. If that is the case, shuffling the list before the forloop results in the list being shuffled only once, instead of being shuffled after each item is printed.p  pAnyone know how I might shuffle that first item before its printed Thanksp

The user then selects their option and the code will display their selection from the array. p  pSo for example p  precodeSelect 1 for apples Select 2 for oranges Select 3 for pears  Please Enter your Selection  codepre  pI keep typing a for loop to display my area but I cannot get my program to read the input from the array this is what I have so far p  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args     string[] fruit  [3]    fruit[0]apples   fruit[1]oranges   fruit[2]pears    for int i  0 i lt fruit.length i        Console.WriteLineEnter 0 to select 1, i, fruit[i]       string choice  Console.ReadLine   int i  int.Parsechoice   Console.WriteLineYou have selected 0 which is 1, i, fruit[i]   Console.ReadLine  codepre  pThis gives me an error and if I place this within the for loop then the program does not display me all my options.p

Negative 1709 pIm switching over to class based views in my project for most of my views just because they are less repeated code, and I cant figure out how to pass an object to a template. By default using a detail view passes the object, which is fine for accessing direct attributes of it, but my objects have tags on them that are defined via an extension and accessed via a function  of that extension. In my old function based view, I would get the list of tags and pass it to the template like this to be iterated over p  precode  return renderrequest, gallerypage.html,              gallery gallery,             tags gallery.misctags.names,             form form          codepre  pMy new view looks like this p  precodeclass GalleryViewDetailView     model  Gallery     templatename  gallerypage.html codepre  purls.py p  precodeurlpatterns  patterns,     urlrPltpkgtd, GalleryView.asview, nameshowgallery,     urlrPltpkgtdedit, GalleryUpdate.asview, nameupdategallery,,  codepre  pThe gallery object is passed to the template fine, and I can access attributes of it, for example the name, by using something like codelth1gt object.name lth1gtcode.  But seeing as it isnt a good idea to try running arbitrary Python code in templates, I need a better way to pass the tags object into the template so I can display them, as something like p  pcode object.misctags.namesjoin,  codep  pright in it will not work.

Negative 1709 pI have a problem that one of my codeJPanelscode doesnt update itself according to the window when its supposed too. I shall try and briefly explain whats happening. A list of characters is fed into an codearraylistcode named lookReply from another class this works as Ive tested this it then uses code2 iterationscode to assign each one to a coordinate in a square table made from codeJLabelscode. These codeJLabelscode are in the lookReplyGUIPanel codeJPanelcode. After a button is pressed new characters get loaded into the codearraylistcode and it repeats itself. However the window does not show this update. I know they are getting fed into the codeJLabelscode through some tests but its just the updating of the window doesnt seem to be working. I am using codeinvalidate, validate and repaintcode but it still doesnt work.

Negative 1709 pIm setting up Autotools for a large scientific code written primarily in C, but also some CUDA.  Ive found an example for compiling amp linking CUDA code to C code within Autotools, but I cannot duplicate that success with C code. Ive heard that this is much easier with CMake, but were committed to Autotools, unfortunately.p  pIn our old handwritten Makefile, we simply use a make rule to compile cudakernels.cu into cudakernels.o using nvcc, and add cudakernels.o to the list of objects to be compiled into the final binary.  Nice, simple, and it works.p  pThe basic strategy with Autotools, on the other hand, seems to be to use Libtool to compile the .cu files into a libcudafiles.la, and then link the rest of the code against that library.  However, this fails upon linking, with a whole bunch of undefined reference to ... statements coming from the linker.  This seems like it might be a namemangling issue with g vs. the nvcc compiler which would explain why it works with C code, but Im not sure what to do at this point.p  pAll .cpp and .cu files are in the topsrc directory, and all the compilation is done in the topobj directory.

Negative 1709 pI would like to have my navigation bar only appear when the mouse is moved, and otherwise not be seen. It is fixed positioned. I tried using p  p html .mousemovefunction p  petc...p  pBut it seems to register even when I leave the mouse completely still that the mouse is moved. What may make this a little tricky is that I want the navbar to appear when the mouse is moved anywhere in the document, not just in the navbar area. Whenever the mouse is not moved, the navbar should not be visible.p  pThe idea is essentially to only make the navbar visible when the user moves the mouse indicating an intent to change something because otherwise it would distract from the content.p

When a user logs into my application with old FB account the education and work details are only partly retrieved. It seems like the transfer of data is interrupted somehow.

However, after the codeRaisePropertyChanged gt CurrentSomethingcode line, one of the lists in the currentSomething field has a two of the items removed.p  pIt seems clear to me that something in my code is subscribed to the event of this property changing and is pruning the list I need left alone.  However, I cant seem to find this handler.p  pstrongIs there an way to find all subscribers to a RaisePropertyChanged eventstrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr I figured out what was up with my object.  It was bound to a control that had a view model that was doing stuff to it.  I am going to leave the question open in case someone has a good answer, but I am no longer stuck.p

Negative 1709 pI have seen many parallax scrolling websites, and a few horizontal parallax websites, but only one example of a Z axis parallax website BeerCamp 2011. I decided to try out the concept, but a bit differently. This wouldnt be scrollbased. Instead it will be animated maybe that is easier in fact, and the scrolling will just go along the Yaxis like normal to look up and down the page in this case, the city. There are two codedivcodes, the one containing the room and the other with the city which is in the back. The room has a window, of which through you see the city. I wanted to give the feeling of walking toward the window. I animated the two divs along the zaxis, the room coming closer and the city getting further I found it gave the best effect.. at different speeds. So far only works with webkit browsers. I used GSAP to animate. However I came across 2 bugsp  ol liScrolling. During the animation toward the city, you can still scroll up and down, past the images. even though I hid the scrollbars just for aesthetics while a solution is found.  Hiding it disabled horizontal scroll which is bad for mobile devices.li liOn refresh the users scroll position could be anywhere, and not on top. This problem is closely related to the above. If the user is not on top scroll position, the end of the room image will be seen.li liResolution.. The images get pixelated when up close. I could use vectors but maybe there is a workaroundli ol  pMy question is, how would you approach this, without creating these bugsp  pa hrefhttpfsdemo.net78.netParallax20Experiment202index2.html relnofollowhttpfsdemo.net78.netParallax20Experiment202index2.htmla  Forgive the horrible load time...p  pAnd in case that link goes down here is the relevant code..p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltbodygt ltdiv classmaincontainergt  ltdiv classrelativecontainergt   ltdiv classperspectivecontainergt      ltdiv classtransformwrappergt                 ltdiv classcityimagegtlt Image is set as BG gtltdivgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classtransformwrapper2gt          ltdiv classroomimagegtlt Image is set as BG gtltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt  ltdivgt  ltbodygt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodebody  margin 0px padding 0px overflow hidden     .maincontainer  minwidth 945px width 100  .maincontainer .relativecontainer  height 100 width 100  .perspectivecontainer .transformwrapper  transform translateZ transformstyle preserve3d height 100 width auto  .perspectivecontainer .transformwrapper2  transform translateZ0px transformstyle preserve3d height 100 width auto  .maincontainer .perspectivecontainer  width 100 height 100 position relative webkitperspective 1000 mozperspective 1000 operspective 1000 perspective 1000 ransformstyle preserve3d   .perspectivecontainer .cityimage  display block position absolute width2000px height3008px backgroundimage url..imageswindow20view1.jpg backgroundposition center 100px backgroundrepeat norepeat left 100px top 100px  .perspectivecontainer .roomimage  display block position absolute width 1280px height 737px backgroundimage url..imagesroom.png backgroundposition center center backgroundrepeat norepeat  codepre  pstrongJS in the head of the document with jQuery amp GSAPstrongp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt window.onload  function var tl  new TimelineLite     tl.to.transformwrapper, 9.5, x50, y0, z100,, city     tl.to.transformwrapper2, 8, x180, y280, z780,, city     tl.to.transformwrapper2, 0.2, autoAlpha0,, 1.5      ltscriptgt ltscriptgt document.scrollTop0  This didnt work for some reason ltscriptgt codepre

Ive also tried to use code.equalsnumcode instead of the codeArray.asListnumcode to check if the value is in there, but that caused the for loop to repeat the Not in database multiple times.p

Negative 1709 pI have a management system for my shader resources which auto generates the HLSL header code for all of my shaders which looks something likep  precode   Texture2DArray ltfloat4gt MyTextureArray1  registert0    Texture2DArray ltfloat4gt MyTextureArray2  registert1    Texture2DArray ltfloat4gt MyTextureArray3  registert2    Texture2DArray ltfloat4gt MyTextureArray4  registert3 codepre  pThe management system also automatically creates and binds all of the shader resource views at creation time. Obviously, my shaders use maybe 1 or 2 of these textures but I leave them all bound all the time. Can anyone speculate as to whether it is better for me to only bind the SRVs that I currently need and clear the others every time I bind a shader, or is it better to just bind all of the SRVs at creation time and never touch them again I havent found much documentation stating the overhead of leaving resources bound even though Im not currently using them.p  pAs a side note, in some of my projects I have 30 or 40 SRVs due to various formats, texture dimensions, and usages.p  pWhich is betterp  p1 Bind all 128 and never change the bindingsp  p2 Bind and unbind SRVs as needed when changing shadersp

Negative 1709 pMy question is highly related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10732690offsettinganhtmlanchortoadjustforfixedheaderthisa previously answered question. In fact, the solution provided by harpo in the comments of the topvoted answer was a partial solution for me. However, Ive found that it actually doesnt work on some of my elements, in particular, elements that have codebordercodes.p  pSome context Im using Bootstrap for my page, and I have a fixed navbar on top, then a page with a load of unstyled codedivscode and code.panelcode divs inside those divs. I have a top padding of 60px on my codebodycode which pushes everything down to account for the navbar. However, when I click on a link with an offset e.g. codeexample.comdiv21code, the top of the div is still covered by the navbar.p  pUsing the solution provided in the linked answer above, I put 60px of negative padding pulling the element up by 60px on the codebeforecode element, then push it down by 60px again by setting the height to 60px. This creates no visual difference intentional but the calculated height of my div is now 60px taller, with the div starting 60px earlier than it should, and the real content starting 60px later. This essentially offsets the content for the navbar again.p  pHowever, Ive found that on elements that have a border, such as my code.panelcode elements, the border seems to contain everything, and the codebeforecode pseudoelement I have no longer has an effect on the calculated height of my div, which means it gets covered by the navbar again.p  pHeres my code on JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netrszqtw803 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netrszqtw803ap  pIf you take a look at the rendered result in any dev tool, you can clearly see that the codebeforecode element is properly created and has the right height 60px for both the outer and inner codedivscode. But for the inner codedivcodes, the overall calculated height of the element ends up not including the codebeforecode element. Disabling the codebordercode with Chrome Dev Tools makes it work for me, so Ive deduced that the border is the problem.p  pSo my question is it possible to get this CSSbased offset to work with my code.panelcode elements without losing the codebordercode or having to go back to inserting codeacode tags everywhere Because quite honestly, without the codebordercode, the code.panelcodes look quite ugly, and nesting every codedivcode in an codeacode tag is also quite ugly.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrong Rewrote my question slightly to hopefully clear up any misunderstandings about my intent. Sorry for my confusing explanation p  pstrongFURTHER EDITstrong Ive added 3 screenshots that hopefully demonstrates this better than any words can ever hope to do. I wouldve added it here, but I cant add more than two links due to lack of reputation.p

Negative 1709 pWith the new Toolbar API in Android Lollipop and AppCompatv7, they are removing a lot of the automatic features to make ToolbarActionBar more robust.

Negative 1709 pI am writing a Laravel app which basically allows you to run tournaments in various formats. Now the problem I have is that I want the same route for each of the different tournament formats. Each format has very different logic and views.p  pAt first I just had a single TournamentController and used if statements in each function to check the type and execute the appropriate logic for examplep  precodepublic function starttournamentId      tournament  TournamentfindtournamentId      iftournamentgttype  single elimination         single elimination logic      elseiftournamentgttype  round robin        round robin logic         codepre  pNow I realise as I add more tournament types, having this type of logic in every function in the TournamentController is going to get messy. So then I created two separate Controllers, SingleEliminationController and RoundRobinController, and in the routes file I made the controllers dynamic by doing something likep  precode    tournament  TournamentfindRequestsegment2      controller  strreplace , , tournamentgttournamentType  RoutegettournamentIdslug, controller . ControllershowTournamentgtwheretournamentId, [09] codepre  pThis seems a bit more manageable, but it still seems a bit hacky, Im sure theres got to be a better way to structure things but I cant figure it out. Any help would be appreciated, thanksp

Negative 1709 pquite new here and not much of a developer. Ive seen this questions asked on this forum but I think I have a situation thats a bit more unique than others and Im not sure how to approach to it.p  pBasically my client has a mysql databaseits on the same server as wordpress db and a php file that works with a few other files one that actually connects to the database and outputs some data and html formatting. Ive been trying to integrate this into a wordpress page but the include command doesnt seem to work. This is probably because its trying to connect to a second database, because when I include a php file with just an echo, it displays fine. p  pIve read that you can use something called a wpdb class but I dont know where it should go or how its used it in this situation. If anyone could maybe direct me into the right direction, I would really appreciate it.p

Negative 1709 pI am working on a page that has some inpage links to some footnotes at the bottom of the page. The issue were running into is after clicking one of these links and reloading, the page does not reload to the top but stays at the footnote anchor likely because of the anchor id appending to the url. Im sure theres a known solution to this but frankly Ive been struggling on how to properly word the question in order to get the information Im looking for. p

Negative 1709 pI am trying to run a local server that for now serves mostly static content from a Windows 7 machine. The problem is that a lot of the content is organized using symbolic links, and when I try and serve these files using CherryPy, they always returnp  blockquote   pThe requested resource returned more bytes than the declared ContentLength.p blockquote  pPresumably this is because CherryPy checks the size of the symbolic link on disk, uses that for the ContentLength, then when it tries to access the file, Windows gives it the full size of the file, and so the two dont match. Im guessing that this problem has been solved at some point, and that theres a config option that I just dont know about, but I cant seem to find a full listing of all CherryPy configuration options.

Negative 1709 pI have a setup with 2 OpenCart sites.  There is an English version of the site, then there is a German version of the site which was cloned from the English version on a subdomain.p  pIt seems that the German version is caching English text in the browser somehow.  Sometimes when going to the German site, some text shows up in English, clearing browser cache fixes the issue, but then it will come back after a while.p  pIm wondering if the English site could be caching some text which then inadvertently shows up on the German site  I havent seen any German showing up on the English version though.p  pAlso, on the German site, the front end language is set to German but the backend is still set to English, could this be part of the problemp  pIm still a bit new to OpenCart, so Im not sure how this caching works.p

Negative 1709 pI started to learn Backbone.js library by implementing a simple project. After seeing a few tutorials, I produced the code which is show below. I am aware that it might not look perfect since I am new to javascript development.p  pSo the below, I am fetching the list of nationalities from the API and then getting the number of students from those specific countries. This seems clear for the time being but the problem is, I need to get the total students per nationality which is why there is a counter in the second collection fetch function. The problem I am facing is about Javascript. Basically, defining total globally and updating it locally is what I need to do. I have come across to many threads similar to this one but to be honest didnt understand well enough to reproduce my own solution. Once again, my question is how I can reengineer this code so that I can update the value of the variable total locally and then use the updated result outside of the inner fetch function.

Negative 1709 pUp to now, in our application, we are dealing with formatting numbers in forms in a quite classical way. We are using jquery and its plugin globalization.p  pIf the user select an input element with a specific class that represents the format type then we unformat the value and when the user releases the focus, we format it again.p  pIs there a efficient way to never unformat numbers  if the user select the input field, then being able modify the value and keep the visible format.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter having take a look to mplungjan comment, I would to know if it is possible to use the I18N format dictionary coming from the globalization plugin into the jquery masked input plugin.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI would like to have the format of the mask adapted to the language of the user. And to I18N the client, we are using a hrefhttpsgithub.comnikgrafjqueryglobal relnofollowthis plugina. This plugin possess a dictionary of format by culture.p  pIn our application, the mayority of number fields have 2 decimals. Such as 1 000,00 in french, 1.000,00 in italian or 1,000.00 in english. If a field already has a value 1.000,00 in italian for the example, currently if the user select the field, on the focus, we will deformat the field and show it like this  1000 the decimal separator will be the . if there is nonzero decimal. And when the user will release the field.p  pI would like to improve this by keeping the formatted value while the field is focused. Except for the 2 decimals, there is no more constraints on numbers.p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI tried a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackagejquery.inputmask relnofollowthis mask plugina but I am not able to do exactly what I need. I would like to create a dynamic mask for any numbers with 2 decimals. But it would also be great that if the user does not write decimals numbers then it will autocomplete on blur event with .00 in english and respectively ,00 in french and italian.p  pThis mask is almost what I need except for the autocompletion  91,3 9990,3[,99]. But its behaviour is still quite tricky for the user. The first block 91,3 has exactly the behaviour  I am looking for. Then if the user just continues writing digits he will directly jump to the last block [,99]. For writing large numbers the user has to write explicitly a space.p  pLatter i will be able to replace the space by the thousand separator and the , by the decimal separator.p  pIf anyone has an idea of how improve my mask or about a different plugin, I will be happy to read your comments.p

Negative 1709 pI am new to meshlab and am trying to reconstruct an stl file which has a number of issues such as over 700 selfintersecting faces, nonmanifold edges and flipped triangles. The part I am trying to fix is a sunglass frame just to give you some perspective. I was able to remove the flipped triangles using Netfabb, which reduced the number of selfintersecting faces. I attempted to fix the rest of the problems by using features within the Cleaning and Repairing tab in Meshlab such as remove nonmanifold edges and intersecting faces however, I was unable to fix all problems with the features in the Cleaning and Repairing tab alone. Thus I decided to convert the mesh into a point cloud, calculate normals from the Sampling tab and try surface reconstruction poisson. This method gave me a mesh that looked like a big blob instead of the detailed part that I was trying to achieve. p  pCan anyone please give me a step by step outline of how I can convert the point cloud back into a mesh with surface reconstruction while maintaining the parts dimensional integrity and avoiding selfintersecting faces Or if you have any other suggestions, Id be more than happy to listen. p  pThank youp

Negative 1709 pI have a WebForms project and try to improve it with the AngularJS. Ive configured UIRouter on one of my pages and multiview is currently working as its intended to. Later on Ive tried to exclude hashtag symbol from the url, so Ive turned on locationProvider.html5Mode, however there is a problem in refreshing a page. As I understood reading through answers on the Stackoverflow and others that the problem is that WebForms treat the url modified by UIRouter as a real url that should correspond to a page and I get 404 error. Ive tried a bunch of proposed solutions, but it seems to me that they could work only for ASP.Net MVC project.p

However, when I log with Serilog as follows, p  precodeseriLogger.ErrorConfigInfo, MySmtpConfigInfo codepre  pthe [NotLogged] attribute is ignored and I see all properties of Credentials including UserName and Password in the clear. I saw a documentation that seems to indicate that if my Credentials property were broken down to UserName and Password properties, then applying [NotLogged] to Password could work. Is that the only option I have using Serilog.Extras.Attributed Thanks muchp

Negative 1709 pLets say you have an object that is occluded by another object, for example you are holding an object in your hands, molding it. While you are holding it you want to reconstruct a 3d model of this object and also not fixed to one location, ie portable. p  pCamera reconstruction does not work because your hands occlude the object, so this excludes photogametry, tof cameras, 3d scanners ect, and lets say you cannot use MRICTXRay since these are not portable.p  pOne option might be to wear gloves and somehow from the position of your hands reconstruct the object. However it seems unlikely a high fidelity model could be generated in this way.  Different glove projects exist a hrefhttptheglovesproject.comdataglovesoverview relnofollowhttptheglovesproject.comdataglovesoverviewa however is there a way to read data from enough strain gauges, or other sensor, to be able to reconstruct an objectp  pAnother interesting option is sensing shape from fiber Bragg gratings, a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchviAeXpTpFLU relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchviAeXpTpFLUa  Perhaps a mesh could be made from these optic lines that fits over the object to be reconstructed a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYDG0ERF2d8 relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYDG0ERF2d8a is even closer, I am pretty sure it uses the same opticalfiber FBG as before.

Negative 1709 pfor a project I am looking for an advanced solution with Solr. We have a database of  1 Mio locations and their respective store hours.  For each business we store up to 4 times per day, e.g. Monday1, Monday2, Monday3, Monday4 example 0800, 1200, 1500, 1800 this would mean the store is open on Monday from 812 and 1518 p  pWe setup Solr Spatial Search to be able to look for all stores which are open at lets say 1600 on Monday which works pretty good. Issue is some stores are open for longer than the current day, e.g. 8pm  2am. Logically this would be Monday 8pm  0am and Tuesday 0am  2am, but businesses would never write it that way so we save it as 8pm  2am. p  pWhen I search for a business on Monday there is no issue, but as soon as I search for a business on Tuesday at 1am it does only consider businesses from Tuesday and the above mentioned store would not be found as open, because the data is still saved for Mondays data.p  pBtw. I need two functions to work... on Monday 10pm I need to show how long this store is still open so I need the value to be in Monday field and on Tuesday I need to see whether this store is open at 1am though the data has been saved in Monday field   elbd 7 mins ago    p  pAny idea how this issue could be solved Would be much appreaciated sorry, I am not a developer per se, so if you need more info let me know and I will get it from my dev, thanksp

Negative 1709 pLong story short. Massive app that uses a container and the notorious empty segue. The container takes NSNotificationCenter notifications to perform segues off of a subclassed NSObject that contains the segues. This means the method prepareForSegue is not being used and if used, does nothing. NSNotification wont work on making the label.text value change if the view controller hasnt been placed on the stack yet, therefore I need something that will go first round. Heres the storyp  pView controller 1 has 2 buttons that when clicked will take you to view controller 2. View Controller 2 has a label that will change text depending upon which button you select. PrepareForSegue method cannot be used due to implementation of NSNotificationCenter and a container that is the listener. p  pIve tried using NSNotificationCenter, but as stated before, only works once the view controller has made it to the stack. I need the change to happen the first time. Thanks.p  pI have an IBAction tied to a button and that IBAction contains the NSNotification to swap my view controllers. The userinfo takes a NSDictionary with objects and keys of the subclassed Segue NSObject that I created for the empty segues. The ContainerView controller has the observers in it for the notifications that will make the segues happen.p

Negative 1709 pIve come across this strange behavior regarding opening a file in append mode and then attempting to seek to the start of the file.p  pThe code should be selfexplanatory In the second open, I expect to be able to write a string to the beginning of the file and then have codef.tellcode return 5 the number of bytes written at the beginning of the file.p  pThe thing is that in Python 2.6.6 and 2.7.6 the final assert fires but, surprisingly, it works in Python 3.3.2.p  precode Create new file, write after the 100th byte. f  opentest, wb f.seek100, 0 f.writebend assert f.tell  100  lenend f.close   Open file for writing without overwriting, attempt to write at start of file  of the file, but doesnt. f  opentest, ab f.seek0, 0 f.writebstart assert f.tell  lenstart f.close codepre  pSo I made a C program that does the equivalent. It actually behaves like the Python 2.x versionsp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main    FILE f  fopentt, wb   fseekf, 100, 0   fwritex, 1, 1, f   fclosef    f  fopentt, ab   fseekf, 0, 0   fwritey, 1, 1, f   printfldn, ftellf   fclosef    return 0  codepre  pThis prints code102code, and I consider this canonical Ive looked at codestrace eopen,close,lseekcode outputs as well, but am none the smarter.p  pSo my question is What kind of embarrassingly basic knowledge do I not havep  pAnd why does Python 3 behave differentlyp  pBy the way, Im on Linux.p

Negative 1709 pI am making researches on image processing on how to detect objects using android smart phones. p  pI am trying to use an external WiFi camera instead of using the androids own camera to perform the object detection.

Negative 1709 pI am asking this question again because I didnt specify exactly what I wanted my code to do in my previous question, so I have the next code in which I start making a PHP query to extract the posts that I have made so far from the database, and yet inside the query I make another one to extract the replies that I have been making for that specific post, in case that there are none, obviously that second query is skipped and it shows the reply form, which takes the id from the post, id used to know to which post is the reply going to belong to.p  pMy problem is the next one, because the form to make the replies is inside the posts query, regardless of which form I submit the form of the first, second, third.. n post, it always takes the id of the first post, so I cant post in other forms, but the logic of my code works perfectly to display the posts and the replies if they are inserted manually in the database.p  precode   ltphp                include

If we implement Q as a binary minheap, we can use the BUILDMINHEAP procedure to perform lines 15 in OV time. The body of the whileloop executes V times, and since each EXTRACTMIN operation takes Olg V time, the total time for all calls to EXTRACTMIN is OVlgV. The forloop in lines 811 executes OE times altogether, since the sum of the lengths of all adjacency lists is 2E. Within the forloop, we can implement the test for membership in Q in line 9 in constant time by keeping a bit for each vertex that tells whether or not it is in Q, and updating the bit when the vertex is removed from Q. The assignment in line 11 involves an implicit DECREASEKEY operation on the minheap, which a binary minheap supports in Olg V time.

Negative 1709 pHow do you controlset where Android Studio searches for java packages to import I am trying to build with the NDK and the GStreamer libraries.p  pThis question is for gstreamer 1.4.5, not the gstreamer SDK 0.10.x. I am using Android Studio 1.1.0, jre 1.8.040b26, NDK androidndkr10d. I am building on fedora linux.p  pIn the main tutorial java file, at the very beginning is the line import org.freedesktop.gstreamer.GStreamer. My android studio build cannot find the package. error package org.freedesktop.gstreamer does not exist I have both the arm7 debug and the release library sets that include GStreamer.java buried down at appsrcmainjniLibsgstreamerandroidarmv7debugsharegstandroidGStreamer.java and it does define the package. In my Android.mk file I have defined GSTREAMERROOT  homeccrislerAndroidStudioProjectsandroidtutorial1appsrcmainjniLibsgstreamerandroidarmv7debug. In my app build.gradle file I have defined          ndk              moduleName tutorial1             cFlags DANDROIDNDK DDEBUG IhomeccrislerAndroidStudioProjectsandroidtutorial1appsrcmainjnigstreamerandroidarmv7debugincludegstreamer1.0         p  pand      sourceSets.main          jni.srcDirs  []  This prevents the auto generation of Android.mk         jniLibs.srcDir srcmainjnilibsgstreamerandroidarmv7debuglibgstreamer1.0static      I get the same error no matter what I do. So the directory search is controlled somewhere that I havent found. I have shanee nishrys blog open which I thought would help me solve the problem, but I seem to miss something more fundamental.

I have a complex type and I wanted to have the user click on a button and retrieve the value of that button so I can use it to update the value of the complex type in the DB. p  pNote that at this point I have already saved the entity into the database and all that is left is to get a way to update properties of the complex type.   If there is a recommended way to do that am willing to adopt that. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1709 pI have a database project that deploys all the asp.net identity databasetables.  I have also seeded the user, roles, and userroles tables with an admin account.p  pThe PasswordHash that I inserted into the aspnetusers table was initially generated when I ran the app locally.p  pWhen I move the application to a web server, I am not able to authenticate the user.  I am assuming the the new web server authenticating the user, it is hashing the password and it does not match the hashed password in the aspnetusers table.  Also, I can redeploy the identity database locally and the account will authenticate successfully.p  pIs there any way to set a config setting so that passwords will be hashed the same on all machines or do you have to create the accounts on the machines they will be hosted fromp

Negative 1709 pIm making an app for my exam that uses thecodeMapKitViewcode andcodeCoreLocationcode for getting different locations and adding pins to the map. p  pBut I realized that I hadnt imported the codeMapKit.frameworkcode in the build settings, which I always was told to do.

Negative 1709 pOur company has a need for defining text file templates where predefined fields can appear basically anywhere positionwise in the file as per customer requirements. The system would work sort of like a mail merge, with the data coming from a database, and the textfile handling performed in a serverside application. The template itself and the output file would be plain text. p  pOur original thought was to tokenize the possible fields and provide a list of tokens to the customer, who could then place the tokens in their desired location in their text template. This is a completely contrived example, but a layout defined like thisp  precodefirstname lastname     totalspring    totalsummer    totalfall    totalwinter codepre  pWould result in output like thisp  precodeTony Carboni     1456    718    2310    1890 codepre  pWhile another customer might use a template that formats the same data like thisp  precodeCarboni, Tony 1456  718 2310 1890 codepre  pThe complexities come in to play when we deal with data comprised of repeating sections, or needing specialized formatting maybe padding international formats whatever...p  pSo, now my question What is best practice in this scenario... Is there a markup language or some kind of standard that we could utilize to ensure that we do this in such a way that any challenges we face have likely already been thought of and addressedp

Negative 1709 pI have recently upgraded to visual studio 2013 and .NET 4.5 from vc9 and .NET3.5. We have been noticing a lot of visual glitches in the user interface.

Ive searched around trying to see if this is a common problem  no luck so far.

Negative 1709 pI have one RCP based application which creates SWT shell and windows to show some real time information. When we use that application in XenDesktop Citrix Mode, I dont get to know if my SWT shell is covered by some other application launched on that XenDesktop like notepad. I want to get some events when some other application is obscuring my SWT windows and when that application is completely moved out of my SWT window basically Z ordering events for windows. So that I can decide to showhide my real time information accordingly.p

Negative 1709 pIn short, my problem seems to be that the CSS keyframe animations seem to only happen the first time the CSS class is applied to an element in an Angular App. After switching to a different view and returning again to the same view later, the CSS class is applied to the element as before but the animation will not happen a second time.p  pFor specific details, Im developing an single page app in AngularJS 1.2.28 and one of my html templates, codewidgetbase.htmlcode contains two views as followsp  precodeltdivgt     ltsection datauiviewwidgetlistviewgtltsectiongt     ltsection datauiviewwidgethomeviewgtltsectiongt ltdivgt codepre  pThe html template for codewidgetlistviewcode has a list of widgets and when selected, some slide animation occurs before the view is switched to that widgets home view in codewidgethomeviewcode as followsp  precodeltdiv ngrepeatwidget in widgetList.widgets ngclasswidget.animation         ngclickselectWidgetwidget classwidgetgt     ltdiv classwidgetDetailsgt         ltpgtwidget.detailsltpgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAfter the widget is selected, codeselectWidgetcode is called passing the selected widget as a parameter where the animation variable is updated e.g. with codesliderightcode adding the css class using ngclass, which animates the widget a slide before another function is called to switch the view. Some interaction will occur on this view, e.g. add widget to basket and once complete, the view is switched back to the codewidgetlistviewcode.p  pNow if you select the same widget again, the element is updated with the correct class as before with ngclass, yet the animation itself does not occur. Selecting the other widgets will play their animation as expected, but as with the first widget, their animation will not occur more than once. p  pThe animation I use can be seen herep  precodeinclude keyframesslidewidgetright      0    left 0      50    left 100px      100    left 200px    .widget.slideright      include animationslidewidgetright 1s     animationfillmode forwards  codepre  pNote keyframes and animation resolve to scss mixins elsewhere in my project, which I trust are working correctly given my animation works correctly the first time.p  pDoes anybody know if this is a specific issue with browsers not performing animation again because it is a single page app Or is there likely to be an issue elsewhere in my code I havent been able to find anything via google or stack overflow with people having a similar issue.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1709 pI have a GestureDetector and i am feeding it MotionEvents and i heavily rely on its return value.p  pNow when the amount of scroll was too low, there is the following line in the source android.view.GestureDetector line 578 p  precodecase MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE  several checks that all not apply else if Math.absscrollX gt 1  Math.absscrollY gt 1    codepre  pbut the last else if will not apply if the scroll limit is too low. Imagine a finger scrolling really slow, stopping for a second, continuing to scroll. When the finger stops the detector returns me a FALSE which means i give the event to the next layer etc and this should not happen because it still is a scroll.p  pIf i extend the detector and override the entire method, i had to copy paste everything except that line and enter a 0 there.p  pCan anyone come up with a more simple solution how my scroll is not interrupted p
