Positive 3847 pIm using kdenlive 9.6 on Ubuntu, and would like to render videos for display on an iPad.p  pIve tried using H.264 Profile but it wont display on an iPad.  I think this is because the profile when I check using mp4info is High3.2, whereas per a hrefhttpwww.theipadguide.comfaqwhatvideoformatswillipadplaysupport relnofollowthis linka this should be max Main3.1 to support iPad.p  pDoes anyone have profile settings I can paste in to get it to render in Main3.1 pleasep

Positive 3847 pI wrote a Node.JS application that uses the codefluentffmpegcode module to watermark videos uploaded on the platform. I pushed the code to a my Google Cloud Compute Engine project, and every time I get codeError  Cannot Find FFMPEGcode. I sshd into the instance once it was created and ran these commands to install codeFFMPEGcode before actually testing out the code. I am not sure what is causing the error because after this I am positive that codeFFMPEGcode is installed. p  precodesudo aptget update sudo aptget install y ffmpeg export FFMPEGPATHusrbinffmpeg export FFPROBEPATHusrbinffprobe codepre

First I compile and libogg using these commands in MSYS, when in the extracted directoryp  precode.configure prefixusrlocalx8664w64mingw32 hostx8664w64mingw32 disablestatic make clean ampamp make j4 make install codepre  pand it looks like everything works no errors reported and I see libogg files in usrlocalx8664w64mingw32.p  pI also compile and install libvorbis and libSDL with similar commands downloads found in links on a hrefhttpwww.theora.orgdownloads relnofollowhttpwww.theora.orgdownloadsap  pI then try to compile libtheora and it fails at the configure.  Here is the command I runp  precode.configure prefixusrlocalx8664w64mingw32 hostx8664w64mingw32 disablestatic codepre  pand the result is an error about not finding the libogg library below is the end of the configure outputp  precodechecking for OGG... no checking for Ogg... no  Could not run Ogg test program, checking why...  The test program failed to compile or link. See the file config.log for the  exact error that occured. This usually means Ogg was incorrectly installed  or that you have moved Ogg since it was installed. configure error     libogg is required to build this package     please see httpwww.xiph.org for how to     obtain a copy. codepre  pDoes anyone have any thoughts on what I am doing wrongp  pThanks,p  pDavidp
Positive 3847 pThis script works great in the terminal but fails when I run the shell script in automator mac. For some reason, automator doesnt remember the gifs name and writes the file as .gif. When run directly in Terminal, the script correctly converts to movie file to Gif and moves it to the correct Dropbox location.  Im trying to run this automator Mov2Gif script when Apple Motion 5 finishes rendering a movie.p  pAny help is appreciated.

Positive 3847 pI am working on x264. I would like to ask one of the old questions related to h.264 MVC 3D. I have read many threads, most of them say there is no open source support for h.264 3d and the technology is dead.p  pI would like to ask the experts here about there opinionp  pIs h.264 MVC 3D support added to any opensource codecs like ffmpegx264.p  pIf its not supported in x264, How can I add 3D support to x264.p  pHow can I proceed, can I take x264 source code and make changes according to the JM of H.264.p  pIs there any open source 3D decoder available.p  pNOTE Please dont mark this question as duplicate, as all the answers I found were answered in 20102012 and hoping many things have been changed by now. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 3847 pI have to migrate a legacy project from Windows Media to HTML5 videoaudio. The system should provide videoaudio content to the web user meeting following criteria  p  ol liPlayout Segments TcIn to TcOut of large videoaudio files should be played on the fly to the web user. Cutting the source material into segments does not work because there is a high overlap rate between segments, so 34 times more HDD space and a lot of extra programming would be needed. Markered playout of the large source files is not an option either as there are forbidden parts of the source material which should never be available to the user.li liCutting In general, users are permitted to make copies of the material. Indeed, by using the dowload function, users can download selected segments.

Positive 3847 pI host a site on a Linux server that I built with php where I am able to upload audio files in one section and video files to another. Each section uses php to upload a single audio file and a single video file. Each upload is assigned a unique filename so they can be viewed separately on an individual page where the uploader can post comments about their audio or video. I want to be able to allow musicians and performers in the local area display their work.  The site works, but large video files do not upload and my audio player only plays a few formats, and I like to convert them all to mp3s.  I installed ffmpeg on my linux server to help me with this and am able to connect to it with my terminal.  My question is how do I get ffmpeg to interface with my uploaded php files. For example, as the user uploads an audio file, can I have ffmpeg convert it while its uploading, or do I need to set up a temporary folder for uploads, store it there, then have ffmpeg compress the file, convert it to a specific format and save it in another folder I would prefer to have it compress and change the format while its uploading so as not to use server space, but if this is not the way ffmpeg works, then I dont have a choice.  Any help would be appreciated. p

Is FFMPEG incapable of generating a file that the DSM520 can play The reason I want to use FFMPEG over Mencoder is that its much faster.

The DSM520 is hooked up to a bedroom tv that isnt a smart tv.p

GoDaddy isnt too unreasonable, and I think their certs are accepted by most web browsers. The thing with GoDaddy is that I dont know why they have different SSL products i.e. why is it cheap to not verify me  does this have any implications on the cert and how the browser treats it if it just contains a domain namep  pAlso, is there an issue with using my own cert  Could the login page be http, and have a line stating that I use a selfsigned cert and here is its fingerprint and then post the form to an https page  Safaris method isnt too bad or sound too scary.  Im afraid, however, that firefox 3s method will scare people away and give me a tonne of emails saying that my site is being hacked or something. I dont know how IE responds to selfsigned certs. There is also the issue of why pay for something I can create myself with no effort, but Im not going to pose the philosophical part of it, this is a more practical question.p  pIn sum, do I give GoDaddy 30 a year or do I just tell people in a small paragraph what Im doing and give the few people that will actually want my fingerprint itp  pEdit Some on a forum I was reading for more info mentioned that GoDaddy certs are only given if its on a GoDaddy server, which this isnt.

Actually more or less a common inmemory database, so I suppose it could be done differently.li liI must be able to have several connections accepted at the same time, but the actual threads are blocking for something most of the time.

Negative 3847 pI have an application for Mac OS X that supports plugins that are intended to be loaded at the same time. Some of these plugins are built on top of a Cocoa framework that may receive updates in one plugin but not another. Given ObjectiveCs current method for function dispatching, any call from any plugin to a given ObjectiveC routine will go to the same routine every time. That means plugin A can find itself eminsideem plugin B with a trivial ObjectiveC call Obviously what were looking for is for each plugin to interact with its own version of the framework upon which it was built. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions178434whatisthebestwaytosolveanobjectivecnamespacecollisionIa a hrefhttpdotnetaddict.dotnetdevelopersjournal.comobjc5Fnamespaces.htm relnofollowhavea a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiObjectiveC relnofollowbeena a hrefhttplists.ximian.compipermailcocoasharp2008January001149.html relnofollowreadinga some on ObjectiveC and this particular need, but havent found a definitive solution for it yet.p  pUpdate My use of the word framework above is misleading the framework is a staticallylinked library, built into the plugins that need it. The way ObjectiveC handles dispatching, however, even these statically linked pieces of disparate code will comingle in the ObjectiveC dispatcher, leading to unintended consequences.p  pUpdate 2 Im still a bit fuzzy on the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions178434whatisthebestwaytosolveanobjectivecnamespacecollisionanswer provided herea, as it doesnt seem to propose a solution as much as an unproven hypothesis.p

Negative 3847 pwhen using PRISM the normal way to hookup things with unity is to define an interface and register an implementation with this interface. Now, I have a problem regarding views.

Negative 3847 pSo I am working on a simple iPhone app, that uses core data to manage objects. My code is similar in function to Apples CoreDataBooks app, found a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiPhonelibrarysamplecodeCoreDataBooksindex.html relnofollowherea. There is a blank UITableViewCell, and you have the ability to add objects to this blank list. If you hit the add button, a DetailViewController pops up that manages the attribute of each object. In the coredatabooks example, the app is like a library, and you can add book objects. My question is about how I might go about making it so that multiple users can have their own separate list of these objects. Again, relating back to coredatabooks, you would be able to make different library objects whose attributes are the book objects themselves. So using the convenient and easy to use coredata ui, would it be very hard to set it up so that in the UITableView, there was LibraryA and LibraryB and then selecting one of the libraries would move me to a screen that has the list of different books unique to that specific library If you then select a book, you would then be able to view that books attributes as before. So I guess my question is regarding how to put another RootViewControlleresque view in front of the native one. As you may gather from this post I am in the learning stage of iPhone development, so I dont even know if logically this is even feasible or the correct way to do it. Any helpinsight on this matter would be greatly appreciated Thanks for your patience  p

Negative 3847 pIve created a program that uses core data and it works beautifully.p  pIve since attempted to move all my core data methods calls and fetch routines into a class that is self contained.  My main program then instantiates that class and makes some basic method calls into that class, and the class then does all the core data stuff behind the scenes.  What Im running into, is that sometimes Ill find that when I grab a managed object from the context, Ill have a valid object, but its properties have been deallocated, and Ill cause a crash.  Ive played with the zombies and looked for memory leaks, and what I have gathered is it seems that the run loop is probably responsible for deallocating the memory, but Im not sure.p  pIs there a way to determine if that memory has been deallocated and force the core data to get it back if I need to access it  My managedObjectContext never gets deallocated, and the fetchedResultsController never does, either.  p  pI thought maybe I needed to use the [managedObjectContext refreshObjectmergeData] method, or the [managedObjectContext setRetainsRegisteredObjects] method.  Although, Im under the impression that last one may not be the best bet since it will be more memory intensive from what I understand.p  pThese errors only popped up when I moved the core data calls into another class file, and they are random when they show up.p  pAny insight would be appreciated.p  pRyanp

Negative 3847 pmaybe Im totally missing something about even handling in jQuery, but heres my problem.p  pLets assume there are some event binding, likep  precodeelement.bindmousemove, somefunc codepre  pNow, Id like to introduce a new mousemove binding that doesnt override the previous one, but temporarily exclude unbind it. In other words, when I bind my function, I must be sure that no other functions will ever execute for that event, until I restore them.p  pIm looking for something likep  precodeelement.bindmousemove, somefunc  Somefunc is used regularly var savedBinding  element.getCurrentBindingmousemove element.unbindmousemove.bindmousemove, myfunc  Use myfunc instead element.unbindmousemove, myfunc.bindmousemove, savedBindings codepre  pOf course, the somefunc is not under my control, or this would be useless p  pIs my understanding that is possible to bind multiple functions to the same event, and that the execution of those functions cant be predetermined. Im aware of stopping event propagation and immediate event propagation, but Im thinking that they are useless in my case, as the execution order cant be determined but maybe Im getting these wrong.p  pHow can I do that Thanks in advance Akip  pEDIT I need to highlight this I need that the previously installed handler somefunc isnt executed. I am NOT defining that handler, it may be or may be not present, but its installed by a thirdparty user.p  pEDIT2 Ok, this is not feasible right now, I think Im needing the eventListenerList, which is not implemented in most browsers yet. a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTR2002WDDOMLevel3Events20020208changes.htmlhttpwww.w3.orgTR2002WDDOMLevel3Events20020208changes.htmlap
Negative 3847 pI have some code that adds mouseover events and mouseout events to all a tags on a page. Id like it so that the mouseout starts a 5 second timer after which time it calls a function.  However, if a new mouseover event fires, it should cancel any existing timers.  The code Im using follows.  The setTimeout is working fine, but it seems like the clearTimeout isnt referencing the right timeoutID, even though I declared it globally.  Any suggestionsp  precodevar timeoutID  function addMouseoverEvent      a.eachfunctionindex          this.mouseoverfunction              clearTimeouttimeoutID              do stuff                  function addMouseoutEvent      a.eachfunctionindex          this.mouseoutfunction              timeoutID  setTimeoutfunction                   do stuff             , 5000                 window.loadfunction      addMouseoverEvent     addMouseoutEvent  codepre  pI should clarify that there should really only ever be one active timer.  Thats why I wanted it to be global.  If a mouseover event occurs no timers should remain.  And if a mouseout event occurs only one timer should be active  the one triggered by the last mouseout event.p

Negative 3847 pIm performing streaming reads of an object using BufferedReader.p  pI need to do two things with this objectp  ol liPass it to a SuperCSV csv readerli liObtain the raw lines and keep them in a Clojure lazy sequenceli ol  pCurrently, I am having to use two different BufferedReaders one as an argument to a SuperCSV CSV reader class and one to initialize the lazy sequence of raw lines. Im effectively downloading the S3 object twice, which is expensive  and slow.p  pOne of my colleagues pointed out that something analogous to a Unix tee command is what Im looking for. A BufferedReader that could somehow be split, download a chunk of data, and pass a copy to both the lazy sequence and csv reader functionality would be useful.p  pIm also currently investigating whether it would be possible to wrap the lazy sequence in a BufferedReader and pass emthatem to super csv. Ive had some Java heap space issues when passing very large lazy sequences to multiple consumers, so Im kind of worried about employing this solution.p  pAnother solution is just downloading the file locally and then opening two streams on this file. This eliminates the original motivation behind streaming allowing processing of the file to begin as soon as data starts arriving.p  pThe final solution, and one that Id consider only if nothing else works, is implementing my own CSV reader that returns both parsed CSV and the original unparsed line. If youve used a very solid CSV reader that can return both a Java Hash of parsed CSV data and the original unparsed line, please let me knowp  pThanksp

Negative 3847 pThis is just an out of curiosity question. Lets say you have a database table with 1m rows in it, and you want to often do queries like looking for either male or female, US or nonUS, voter or nonvoter etc, its clearly very efficient to define a bitmap index for the table in which each bit represents one eitheror condition.p  pHowever, to execute the query, you still have to scan through probably all of the index doing a bitand to select matching rows.p  pMy question is is there some kind of bitmapoptimized storage such that the bit channels are precreated in the hardware Im envisaging something similar to knitting needles lifting punched cards out of an old library catalog system. In other words, rather than going row by row through memory locations, the chip can just pull out the matching rows electronically because there are hardware connections for each bit channel Ive a feeling the brain must work something like this. If I think of all blue objects, and then restrict that to all long blue objects and then all long blue heavy objects, my brain does it effortlessly and Im sure its not scanning through all the objects I know about every time. It seems like perhaps there is some neurons that provide pathways for different dimensions for quick retrieval. Im just wondering if theres anything like this in the hardware worldp  pThanksp

Negative 3847 pI have a 64 bit server, 8 GB RAM, dual quad CPU. No resources are ever hitting 100 except, I guess, the JVM  right.p  pI need to index several million records for Solr, but the machine is in production. I recognize having a second machine for indexing would be helpful.p  pShould I dedicate a second instance of the JVM, dedicated to Solrp  pRight now, when I run an index, pages which are normally served in 200 milliseconds will serve up in about 1.5 seconds, sometimes more... hitting, even, the dreaded Service is Unavailable error.p  pI adjusted my JVM Heap as followsp  precodeXmx1024m XXMaxPermSize256m codepre  pIn case Im chasing the wrong solution, allow me to broaden the landscape a bit. It seems that I cant affect the indexing speed of Solr. I had previously been indexing about 150,000 records per hour on a dev server virtualized on a workstation. In a production environment with much more hardware available, Im indexing at the exact same speed.p  pWithout data to prove it, I think that my JVM adjustments did not speed up the indexing, although it may have allowed the CF server to continue serving pages. I must say, the indexing speed is terribly slow, but I do know that its not a function of the data access layer. I rewrote it from pure ORM to objects backed by SQL Stored Procedures thinking that was the slowdown no effect.p

Negative 3847 pI have a school project in Java assigned to do the followingp  blockquote   pWrite an application to be used in a   college admissions office.   To be   admitted to this school, the student   must have either   A grade point   average of 3.0 or higher and an   entrance score of 60 or higher An   entrance score of 85 or higher and any   grade point average   To make things   more user friendly, write some code to   do some error checking of the data.br   That is, if the grade point average is   not between 0.0 and 4.0 or if the   entrance score is not between 0 and   100, then print an appropriate error   message to the screen telling the user   that they entered invalid data.   Use   the above criteria to write a   procedure called, accepted, that takes   the grade point average and entrance   score as parameters and returns no   value.   This procedure will print   either Accept or Reject,   accordingly. Finally, write a main   procedure that prompts the user for a   grade point average and an entrance   score.   This procedure should then   call the accepted method to display   the result.p blockquote  pAlthough I foolishly wrote the following code below without thoroughly reading the directions.

Negative 3847 pstrongIn context of a web application, Is it suitable to do some JOIN operation in Java, on the data retrieved from the databasefrom first query, and use that JOINed data for the second and final query to the database to get the required data.strong p  pDoes Java provide any built in mechanism for such implementations or what could be the best possible way to do this p  pI know, this is not the best thing to do, but the database is not a SQL database amp does not allow for JOIN operations.p  pstrongThe data for the JOIN operation is     One dataset contains about 50 integersavg and other contains about 150 integersavg.strongp  pThe  1st dataset would have list of only integers but the second will have a list of sets of integer amp a datainteger.  If the two integers in the two datasets intersect then the corresponding datainteger is passed in the results list. So the result would contain the data integers  corresponding to the intersected integers.p  pFor e.g.  List A  21, 65, 93 List B  21, 42342, 53,73242, 93, 32312p  pResult  42342, 32312 p  pBoth of the two sets data for the JOIN operation may be implemented in the form of a tree structure. Hence this JOIN operation could be made more efficient because only trees will need to be compared not the entire list  While performing JOIN, if the two similar depth nodes do not match at some node in the tree, then all its child nodes will be skipped, and the control will move to the next top nodep  pThanks.p

Negative 3847 pI have a Mac application that keeps its own log file. It appends info to the file using NSStrings writeToFile method.

Now the problem is that after adding that URL encoding line, nothing seems to be getting written to the file. The program functions as expected otherwise however. Removing the line of code above results in all of the correct information being logged to the file removing that line is not an option because searchString must be URL encoded.p  pOh and I am using NSUTF8StringEncoding when writing the NSString to the file.p  pThanks for any help.p  pEDIT I know theres also a similar function to CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes in NSString, but Ive read that it doesnt always work.

Negative 3847 pLets say you have a web page of a list of about 500 books properties cover image, titles, authors, summaries, etc and want to paginate them.  One way would be to use the limit and offset parameters, another would be by using cursors.  For each subsequent page, the next batch would be fetched.  But, what if you just fetched all the books, memcached the whole list for speed, used classes to hide the books belonging to other pages, and then used jquery for pagination  Wouldnt this be quicker and less quota intensive than the limitoffset or cursor methodsp  pThis could also work for nonjavascript users, simply by setting an appropriate hide class for the books belonging to other pages.  It may be slower for them although the memcache might help with that, but isnt it reasonable to assume that most modern day users have javascript enabledp  pI could also then add more jquery features to the page, such as jquery searching handy since app engine cant do full text searches, filtering, loading, etc.p  pIt seems so much better, but are there disadvantages  Why isnt everyone doing this, given that jquery is quite easy to learn  In other stackoverflow posts, about app engine pagination, no one even mentions jquery.p

Negative 3847 pLong time listener  first time caller.  I am hoping to get some advice.  I have been reading about caching in .net  both with System.Web.Caching and System.Runtime.Caching.  I am wondering what additional benefits I can get vs simply creating a static variable with locking.   My current simple minded caching method is like thisp  precodepublic class Cache      private static ListltCategorygt allCategories     private static readonly object lockObject  new object      public static ListltCategorygt AllCategories              get                      lock lockObject                              if allCategories  null                                      allCategories  DB CALL TO POPULATE                                           return allCategories                codepre  pOther than expiration and I wouldnt want this to expire I am at a loss to see what the benefit of using the built in caching are.p  pMaybe there are benefits for more complex caching scenarios that dont apply to me  or maybe I am just missing something would not be the first time.  p  pSo, what is the advantage of using cache if I want a cache that never expires Doesnt static variables do thisp
Negative 3847 pSo I have been reading for the last few days on JSP and HTML. I read that it is not possible to have nested forms in HTML.p  pDoes anyone have any indication of how to do this Is there some JSP code that can aid in this There is no such thing in my JSPJava book.p  pSee I have a form, to which there are elements that the user can dynamically add or delete  including new forms. So you can think of it as a hierarchy  I have a parent form, with X user defined children, each child can have Y user defined children..etc So when a form is submitted, it creates a new form inside this form  then when the outer most form is submitted, all the details of the forms and subforms are then compounded into a report I havent decided what I am going to do with this information. All this information is location specific, so the nesting is mandatory.p  pI have produced a hack, with global variables and some javascript  but it is vulnerable, and most likely will break when the concept of users are added, with sessions etc. So I do not want to use this at all, given that it will be painful to debug.p  pThanks, U.p

Negative 3847 pI am storing an ItemId value in a cookie to keep track of the users currently selected item. This ItemId is not sensitive data, I dont care if users can see the value. This value will need to be accessed on most pages, that was why the decision was made to keep the value in a cookie instead of the database. If it were in the db i wouldnt have this problem.p  pThe problem is the user could modify that cookie ItemId to another users ItemId and they would then potentially be able to perform actions on someone elses item. That is unless I verify the cookie value against the database to make sure it is valid for the user logged in. Which means a hit to the db defeating the purpose of putting the value in a cookie.p  pBasically my question is how do I prevent the user from modifying the cookie or at least knowing it was modified I know the .NET forms authentication cookie stores user id and role data, so they obviously have the same issue..p  pMy initial thought was to encrypt the values in the cookie. I understand the cookie could still be hijacked, but would this at least prevent tampering its valuesp  pMaybe I should have gone the db route insteadp  pThanks.p

Negative 3847 pWe are putting together a web dev team that will also be building complimentary iOS, Android and webOS mobile apps, and are trying to standardize our toolset between team members.

Also, we use git for version control if it matters.p  pOur primary experience is in web development, so the tools were most familiar with are glorified text editors like BBEdit, Coda, CSSEdit, etc. For Flash work weve just used whats built into Adobe Flash Pro.p  pApple provides their own Xcode IDE for iOS, which is also the only native mobile app development weve done so far. webOS Enyo is so simple, we could continue doing that in a text editor.

Negative 3847 pI am working with user submitted files that have a number of invalid characters in them, most of them do to MS Word converting things like hyphens to endashes or quotes to smart quotes.  I am writing a method to replace several of these specifically e.g. convert endashes back to hyphens and now I need to replace all other invalid characters with a space.  So my first attempt was to use regex to match the invalid characters with [x80xFF] then replace only the matches.  My thought was that only looping through the matches would be much quicker than 127 replaces in the form of blahblah.replacechr128, .p  pThe issue Im having is that .net regex doesnt seem to match or replace on the hex values above x7F dec 127.  Is there a way to set .net regex to use the full unicode character setp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 3847 pRecently Ive managed to get the Razor parser working under .NET 3.5 and hosted by SQL Server 2008. At the moment, its really just an experiment to see what is feasible.  This is working, including dynamic compilation of razor template assemblies which are then loaded into the AppDomain a hrefhttpwww.fidelitydesign.netp415 relnofollowthat was a missiona.p  pBecause SQLCLR does not allow you to use Assembly.Load in any SQLCLR hosted code, even with codePERMISSIONSET  UNSAFEcode. My workaround for this is to register the assembly directly after compilation using codespexecutesqlcode which I build the codeCREATE ASSEMBLYcode statement. When I dynamically render these template assemblies, I do so with codePERMISSIONSET  SAFEcode to ensure they dont do anything outside what is permitted for safe assemblies. p  pNow the tricky part is, these razor templates are running in the context of the connected user, so they have access to the database, e.g., in my template, I emcouldem dop  precodeimport System.Data.SqlClient      using var conn  new SqlConnectionContext Connection  true              conn.Open          Execute something against the database       codepre  pcodePERMISSIONSET  SAFEcode will allow for this, as that is one of the reasons SQLCLR even exists, but in these template assemblies I want to introduce some additional security that would allow me to prevent users from executing anything against the database.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to disable types, such as codeSqlConnectioncode or codeSqlCommandcode, perhaps using Code Access Security or another methodp

Negative 3847 pIve been having problems created modular reusable components in my Zend Framework app. In this case Im not referring to Zend Framework modules but rather the ability to have a reusable MVC widgety thing if you like. The problems Im having may be very particular to my implementation, but Im completely happy to throw it out and start again if someone can point me in the right direction. Anyway, specifics and code will hopefully explain things better and even if what Im doing is not the best way it should show what Im trying to achievep  pA simple example is a Mailing List sign up form. I want to include this on several pages of the site which use different Controllers and this presents a few problems in how to process the data and return relevant messages. I dont want to do either of the following as they really smellp  ol liCreate a base controller with the form processing in and extend Badli liDuplicate form processing code in relevant controllers Even worseli ol  pThe clean way to go feels to me to create a new Controller to process the mailing list form data, use a View Helper to easily output the form and relevant markup into the desired pages and then redirect back to the page where signup occurred once the form has been processed. However, Id like to use the form validation provided by ZendForm, which means Id need to pass the form object back to the view helper somehow if validation fails but in the same request. Im currently doing this by setting it as a variable on the view and then forwarding back to the previous page rather than redirecting, which is okish. If validation is ok then Id prefer to use a redirect back to the original page. Im having trouble doing this though as Id like to pass messages back to the component about the state of signup. Normally Id use the FlashMessenger Action Helper, I could namespace it in this case so messages didnt clash with other page data, but I cant access it from within a View Helper. So currently Im forwarding in this case too. Id much prefer a redirect to prevent form resubmissions if a user refreshes the page and to keep the URL clean. I realise I essentially want to have a mini MVC dispatch process within a page and I think thats what the action stack is for I really dont know much about this though and any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 3847 pI have a 3D surface created by the ListPlot3D in mathematica. The surface itself is relatively planar and in the arbitrary plane xy. I would like to place this surface on top of a molecule either generated from the ChemicalData function or inputted from a .pdb or other molecule input. This molecule is also planar and placed again the in the xy plane. I would like these two 3D objects to be separated by some z distance. p  pThe end hope is that I will have a potential energy surface placed above this planar molecule that will still be rotatable in 3D. I have been using the Show and Graphics 3D options to no success. The x,y points on the surface correspond to x,y points on the 3D molecule, however they can easily be scaled and shifted as needed. As an option of last resort I suppose I could input the x,y,z coordinates of the atoms and use the PointListPlot3D command with various options to mimic the look of the molecule but this seems to be much more complicated then it needs to be. p  pAnother approach that could be possible is if both of the 3D objects are converted to 3D boxes and simply stacked on top of each other. However I have not found this functionality as of yet in mathematica.

However their atomic distance seem to be off by 3.p  pAs an update to this it became much simpler to take the xyz coordinate of the molecule and hand generate the objects. It has been some time but I believe if you only statep  precodeChemicalData[Benzene,MoleculePlot] codepre  pMathematica will show you the format.

Negative 3847 pIv question regarding PayPal chained payments. I employ freelancers who are the secondary receivers from different countries who provide online services to my customers. The customer should pay directly to the freelancers and also directly to me my share. I think that chained payments are the best option because in this case the freelancer cant see the customer details and vice verse. One problem remain though, I understand that before the payment to the freelancer is done, it pass through my account. If this is the case, then the whole sum that the client paid would pass through my account and for tax reasons the whole sum is considered as my income while in fact only part of it goes to me. I have no problem with the payment to the receivers pass through me, but I dont want it to be documented as income, only the part that goes to me should be documented as income  and  the share of the receivers should be documented from the beginning as their share. Is it possible with this optionp
Negative 3847 pI am still researching on evaluating clusters formed using clustering unsupervised learning p  pI tried googling but the measures I get are too theoretical. It will be great if people can share the mechanisms they are using to evaluate the clusters formed. Say I have a Java Cluster so that will contain Java EE, Java ME, RMI, JVM etc. ,another cluster say NoSQL and that will have something like Neo4j, OrientDB, CouchDB etc. This is perfect and my clustering Algorithm has given me most accurate clusters. p  pHowever after training and then testing I may get say MySQL, Oracle under NoSQL cluster so I just do a manualvisual interpretation and then retrain my Algorithm or tweak it so that I get better Clustering. p  pNow I want to automate this process of visualizing clusters manually and have a system that gives me the accuracy of clusters formed. I am looking out for something similar to Precision , Recall, NDCG, Map etc used in search. My clusters are varying in length and there can be n  different cluster formed so precisionrecall would not be the right thing. p

Negative 3847 pI appreciate that to find the precise error I will need to provide some code, but I am not sure which part of the code is at fault. Let me know and Ill paste it up.p  pSCENARIO I have a number of SVGs that are embedded as objects. They render fine in all browsers except Firefox is starting to render XML Parsing Error junk after document element then it tells me the problem is in the svg doc, it also tells me which line and outputs some svg vector numbers.p  pWell look there then you are telling me. BUT on one computer the 4th svg produces the XML Parsing Error and the 5th svg object is fine,  and on my OTHER computer its the 5th svg object telling me to check a different document and the 4th svg object is fine. This makes me think it is the html document. p  pAnother reason for me to doubt that it is the xml code is that I didnt hand code it, it has been produced  via inkscape, and the fact that in effect each svg works in all browsers and even occasionaly in Firefox, makes me think the problem lies else where. p  pEDIT THIS PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED BY CLEARING THE CACHE.

Negative 3847 pMy goal is this p  pSuppose that a random number r is generated every second. I would like to write an application preferably in C though if a language where this is easier is suggested Ill choose that so that the application prints r every second to the text field selected by the user at that instant. p  pHere is a use case a user is running 3 applications in win7 64 bit, the applications are notepad, chrome browser, and mspaint. The user selects mspaint through alttab and clicks on the text box tool. He creates a textbox on the screen and clicks on it so that the cursor is in the text box. During this process 5 seconds pass and the application has generated 5 random numbers, since the cursor was never located in a text field nothing was printed. The instant the cursor is in the text field a second has passed, and a new number is generated. This number prints to the text box. The user keeps the cursor in the text box, another second passes and the new random number will overwrite the previous random number and anything else in the text field with the new random number. If the user switches the cursor position to the url selection portion of chrome similar behavior should be exhibited. Similarly with the search field of google.com inside chrome, and again in notepad. If the cursor were in notepad for 3 seconds then every second the full textbox inside notepad would be replaced with a random number, at the end of the 3 seconds only the last random number will be in notepad. p  pIn short I want to be able to overwrite any text field selected by a user in win7. p  pAny help p

Negative 3847 pI am using node.js and express, and I am calling serverside functions and syncing variables using nowjs. Suppose the user is drawn as a sprite on the canvas.

When the user presses the right button, the serverside updatePosition function is called, which adds 32 pixels to the xcoordinate of the position array. This array is then shared with the client, and the new position is drawn on the canvas using clientside function.p  pSuppose I dont want to draw the sprite at the new position instantly. I want to play a walking animation that gradually moves the sprite 32 pixels to the right, and takes say 1 second to complete. I might implement it this wayp  ol liUser presses the right button.li liThe animation starts playing clientside.li liupdatePosition is called serverside as usual.li liWhen animation on the client finishes, check if the final position clientside matches the coordinates stored server side.li ol  pWhen the user presses the right buttonkey, he cannot repeat the keypress until 1 second later. The 1 second long walking animation has to complete and final position checked with the serverside coordinates before he can press right again to move his sprite.p  pQuestion How do I keep track of the 1 second server side I cant do it clientside because the user will be able to hack his client to reduce the animation time.p  pIs the solution to timestamp the position array E.g. position   x  0 y  0, time 0 . If the user presses the right button again, the server would check to see if the last position update was greater than 1 second ago. If less than 1 second, the server ignores it.p

Negative 3847 pIve seen tons of questions and answers regarding merging an iPhone and an iPad app into an universal app, but that isnt what I want to do. What I am going to do is use in app purchase to unlock an iPad interface and then display the correct interface using conditionals. If the interface is purchased, the app displays the iPad Nib, and if not, it just displays the same way as an iPhone application does with the option to scale the app, etc. The conditionals are very simple and I have already implemented them, however the issue I run into is this If the IAP is NOT purchased, the iPad displays the iPhone Nib, but not in the typical way. It is just in the corner with no option to scale it, rather than in the center with the black border that you usually see. Does anyone know how I can set it up so i fixes this issue Im a little stumped to be honest.p

All of them failed with a compiler error With GCC literally error thing is not a member of foo and an instantiation context.p  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt  struct foo    enum  hasthing  false    struct bar    enum  hasthing  true    static int thing  return 0    template lttypename Tgt struct Test    auto gotypename stdenableifltThasthing, intgttype0    gt decltypeTthing      return Tthing       typename stdenableifltThasthing, decltypeTthinggttype go      return Tthing       template ltbool BThasthing, typename stdenableifltB, intgttype  0gt   auto go gt decltypeTthing       return Tthing      int main    Testltbargt b   Testltfoogt f  codepre  pI can see what the problem is  codedecltypecode needs to happen before the codeenableifcode even gets a chance to rule out the function. The question that remains is how to work around and get similar behaviour Is there a simple, generic way to do this without resorting to writing  codehasthingcode trait to use in the codeenableifcodep  pTested with both G 4.7 and clang 3.0.p

Negative 3847 pFirst of all I would like to tell you all that I did a lot of research on Google and elsewhere but to no avail. p  pI want to know how do I go on about making a text editor in turbo c without windows API. I started making it some time back in turbo c and I also learned how to include mouse using int86 function and I implemented that. But time and again I am getting stuck on something or the other. Like right now I am stuck how do I strongHighlightstrong and strongSelectstrong the text for right clicking.p  pSecondly I also learned how to access video memory however fake or old it may be these days to have better control over the text.p  pAlso for the text input I am using a large array as I have little knowledge about using Link Lists for such large text input and manipulating it.p  pNote I do not want to use any other IDE or any API for it due to purely educational reasons. p  pPlease guide me on how to get this thing go on further till completion. I am willing to learn all additional things to complete it.p  pPS This is strongNotstrong a homework. Just for learning purposes.p
Negative 3847 pIm trying to understand how PHP manages memory and variables with static methods in extended classes. Ive got three classes one entitled Model, User1, User2. Hencep  precodeclass Model      static public structure     static public name     static function getstructure          return selfstructure  filegetcontentsselfname..json       class User1 extends Model    class User2 extends Model    User1name  User1 User2name  User2 echo User1getstructure echo User2getstructure codepre  pIf I run User1getstructure for some reason it doesnt populate the result accordingly, it seems to be grabbing the value of User2 the last name value declared.p  pIm operating on the assumption that declaring User2 and extending Model creates a completely separate scope for my name property. So User1 and User2 are declared as separate classes with the same structure as Model. Then I can statically define values for them in separate scopes.p  pIm now however questioning that. If I extend and call the same name variable do they both point back to the Model class Or does it only create a separate scope when I declare each class with new User1 and new User2p  pThanks.p
Negative 3847 pSo I have looked around a quite a bit, and nothing on here seems to explain exactly the correct way of doing this. I have 7 UITextFields within a custom UITableViewCell. p  pMy question is this What is the correct way of managing the delegate of these UITextFields p  pSince the custom cells are technically part of the model portion of the project, I would rather have the controller that controls the UITableView also control the text fields in the tables cells, but I can not figure out how to set the delegate for the text fields which are created in the subclass of UITableViewCell to this view controller.p  pWould it be bad practice to just make the subclass of UITableViewCell conform to UITextField delegate and manage all of that stuff in there If so, how else should I go about doing thisp  pThanks, any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 3847 pA design problem which Ive seen in several workplaces Ive been to, yet without a satisfactory solutionp  pSuppose you have a system with dynamic number of threads.p  pEach thread must have an access to a set of singletons, the singletons have one and only one instance per thread therefore they are not real singletons, but singletons per threadp  pThis set of singletons is known at compile time.p  pEach of the singletons has a default constructor in order to simplify things, nevertheless, a solution that does not have this constrain would be greatp  pA satisfactory solution should have the followingsp  ol lipEach thread can access any of its singletons in o1 timepli lipAn access to a singleton is lock free pli lipAdding a singleton to the singleton set does not require new code written on the set sidepli lipThe singleton set is populated during compile timepli ol  pIm not sure if such a design is feasible. If it is, I assume that it requires a little bit of meta programming.p  pThanks in advance for any of your insights.p

Negative 3847 pI am trying to map a continuous variable relativefrequencytotal to binary values topicality. All values above a certain threshold should be mapped to one, all below or equal to it to the other value. Since I want the resulting variable to stay as predictive as possible, I first take each decile of the continuous variable, try mapping relativefrequencytotal using that decile as the cutoff point, feed the resulting binary variable into a logistic regression model, and remember that models R2, like thisp  precodequanteval  data.framequantile  numeric100, R2  numeric100 counter  1 forq in seq1,11,by1     domtopicality[domrankedfrequencytotal gt quantiledomrankedfrequencytotal[q]] lt topical     domtopicality[domrankedfrequencytotal lt quantiledomrankedfrequencytotal[q]] lt nontopical     tmp.lrm lt lrmDOM  as.factortopicality, datadom     quanteval[counter,quantile]  q     quanteval[counter,R2]  tmp.lrmstats[R2]     counter  counter1  quanteval codepre  pNow here are my questionsp  p1 This works well with quantiles 14, but at the 5th I get an error message saying topicality has lt2 category levels. What does that meanp  p2 What really confuses me is that this error message seems to depend on the order in which I try the quantiles. For instance, when I try quantile 1 or 10 without the loop, everythings fine. When I try quantile 5 in isolation I get the error message, and when I try 1 and 10 again after that I also get it. Does lrm somehow remember what I did last, or why is this  I also thought that the reason could be that I reuse the same column again and again for mapping rankedfrequencytotal, but then I tried renaming the column eap  pThe original dataframe dom is rather huge, but for me the error message is repeatable with the following extractp  precode   DOM relativefrequencytotal 1  DAT             0.0203549061 2  DAT             0.0203549061 3  NOM             0.0005219207 4  NOM             0.0005219207 5  NOM             0.0005219207 6  NOM             0.0005219207 7  NOM             0.0015657620 8  NOM             0.0015657620 9  NOM             0.0015657620 10 NOM             0.0005219207 11 NOM             0.0005219207 12 NOM             0.0010438413 13 NOM             0.0010438413 14 NOM             0.0041753653 15 NOM             0.0005219207 16 NOM             0.0005219207 17 NOM             0.0041753653 18 NOM             0.0005219207 19 NOM             0.0010438413 20 NOM             0.0020876827 codepre
Negative 3847 pIve been reading through the OpenGL ES Shading language specification and there is a section that puzzles mep  blockquote b7.2 Fragment Shader Special Variablesbbr  ...br  It is not a requirement for the fragment shader to write to either glFragColor or glFragData. There are many algorithms, such as shadow volumes, that include rendering passes where a color value is not written. blockquote  pIve looked at plenty of articles on shadow volumes and shaders and I cant find any information on how these algorithms can do anything without writing a colour value as there does not seem to be a way of returning data from the vertex shader alone on the ES platform. Desktop GL has geometry shaders which seem to be for this kind of effect, but there is no such thing in ES 2.0 Core.p  pIs this something that was inadvertently left in from the desktop specification, allowing for extensions or have I just missed somethingp

Negative 3847 pIve been working on a WebGL application that requires a tremendous amount of point data to draw to the screen.

Negative 3847 pI feel like I may be doing something dumb.p  pIve had a Linq to SQL library running for years, and used it in several applications that use the same database.  There are a bunch of things Im not terribly happy with though, and I just got a new project.  I was thinking that it would be helpful to put a business logic layer between the application and the Linq to SQL library.  The problem is the more I design it out, the more it looks like Im just trying to implement something that looks just like  Linq to SQL.p  pFor instance, I decided that the application should have a single entry point to the business logic.  So that entry point I called it MCP has a property for class in the system, and this property has a list probably IQueryable that contains all the objects from the corresponding table.  Which starts sounding, and looking, a lot like a Linq to SQL data context...plus I feel like having an extra objectaccessor wrapped around every existing object is a ton of extra typing just to hide the real objects.p  pSo because of that Im a little afraid Im just doing a bad reimplementation of what I already have.p  pOn the flipside, I am hopefully improving on how everything works.  For instance ensuring that an object has one logical responsibility, rather than it being a way of accessing anything else in the system.  For instance a CarCP might have a method for AddDriverPerson p but Person wouldnt necessarily have methods to go back to CarCP.p  pSo maybe it is better to have this middle layer, but Im just designing it badly  p

Negative 3847 pIn my current project I am working with a specific implementation of the jface ProjectionViewer attached to a codeTextEditorcode nested in a codeMultiPageEditorcode.  My task is now to implement a custom reaction to CtrlZ, and from what I get this is best done by attaching a specific implementation of codeIUndoHandlercode to the Viewer, all of that would be no problem.p  pBut, pressing CtrlZ while having that TextEditor focused fails to cause any reaction that would be expected. While clicking emUndo Typingem in the context menu, which displays the associated key combination CtrlZ causes the codeTextViewerUndoManager.DocumentUndoListenercodes notification method is called, no line of code in the codeTextViewerUndoManagercode is touched when pressing CtrlZ. p  pAs a possible source of this problem I assumed that maybe a handler might be defined for this key combination in an extension point, since I had previously experimented with this mechanism, but the plugin.xml does not define any key combinations nor undo handlers apart from one that is associated with a special context menu for a different widget.p  pIt might be worth to note that CtrlC and CtrlV work as intended.p  pI need to find out what happens when CtrlZ is pressed and why nothing is relayed to the codeTextViewerUndoManagercode.p  pIt would be very helpful if someone could describe the progress how eclipse handles these key combinations normally and decides which command is appropriate.p  pThanks in advancep

This would represent a Project number, what would be used to get the specific data from a list or database.p  pIve come up with some other solutions that basically fill in the data, but at another point of the process of the document p  ol liusing a combination of a Workflow amp filling in the data through InfoPath. This works for a library with only 1 content type the default. Once we want to use multiple Content types it is nearly impossible to get the site name because InfoPath is not able to use the function SPContext.Current.Web.Title.li liTo solve the content type problem I used the Event Receiver ItemAdding. This way the data is added when the document is being added. The disadvantage that this gives is that the data will only be visible in the document if the users opens it a second time, what isnt really user friendly.li ol  pSo to optimize the user experiences and usability I would like to add the data before the document opens in word.

Negative 3847 pIm looking for suggestions on how to approach using an ORM in this case, EF5 in the design of modular NonMonolithic applications, with a Core part and 3rd party Modules, where the Core has no direct Reference to the 3rd party Modules, and Modules only have a reference to CoreCommon tables and classes. p  pFor arguments sake, a close enough analogy would be DNN.p  pCodeFirstp  pWith CodeFirst, the approach I used was to build up the model of the Db was via reflection in the Cores DbContexts DbInitialation phase, I used Reflection to find any class in any dll eg Core or various Modules decorated with IDbInitializer a custom contract containing an Execute method to define just the dlls structure. Each dll added to the DbModel what it knew about itself.  Any subsequent Seeding was also handled in the same wa searching for a specific IDbSeeder contract, and executing it.p  pPro   the approach works for now.  The same core DbContext can be used across all respositories, as long as each repo uses dbContext.GetSet, rather than expecting it to be a property of the dbContext. No biggie. Cons    it only works at startup ie, adding new modules would require an AppPool refresh.   CodeFirst is great for a POC. But in EF5, its not mature enough for Enterprise work emyetem and I cant wait for EF6 for StoredProcs and other features to be added.   My DBA hates CodeFirst, at least for the Core, wanting to optimize that part with Stored Procs as much as as possible...Were a team, so I have to try to find a way to please him, if I can find a way... p  pDatabasefirstp  pThe DbModel phase appears to be happening prior to the DbContexts constructor reading from embedded .edmx resource file.  DbInitialization is never invoked as model is deemed complete, so I cant add more tables than what the Core knows about.p  pIf I cant add elements to the Model, dynamically, as one can with CodeFirst, it means that   either the Core DbContexts Model has to have knowledge of every table in the Db  Core AND every 3rd party module. Making the application Monolithic and highly coupled, defeating the very thing I am trying to achieve.

The application then shows the dj witch listeners requests there are. p  pNow that all works fine but they have to build a music database them self witch I use to search for music. My question isp  pIs there an online music database witch I my use cross scripting with soapxml or something similar. I prefer XML but if there is a good database witch gives the result in other format that wont be a problem.p  pI searched Google for this but I only find information how to download illegal mp3 files.

Anything with the prefix s is a sfSprite. p  pThis program is working fine with one exception, when I press the left mouse button on a tile I want to change, the previous sprite disappears leaving a blank square area, and the replacement sprite displays in the top left corner of the window until the mouse button is released. The replacement sprite is then correctly displayed at the mouseclick location. p  pTo me this indicates that the new sprite is being generated on mouseclick, but not receiving the setPosition coordinates until the mouse button is released. I am unsure how to fix this, and have not been able to find an answer that is simple enough for me to understand at least, I am only learning.p  pThankyou for your attention.p

Although in the html the user only has 2 options to select from but the db doesnt know that. The gender column will pretty much accept anything. I just wanted to know if a nuisance user can disregard the select options and somehow insert a silly answer into the Gender column If so, how can I protect from that.p

Negative 3847 pI have a 64 bit Visual Studio 2010 single threaded C  Windows application that I am trying to integrate tcmalloc with and I am running into problems when using any of our dynamically linked dlls . I linked tcmalloc as a static library. tcmalloc works great until the application starts using one of our shared dlls . I built the solution as a 64 bit DEBUG application. All of the dlls link with the CC debug versions of CRT libraries MSVCP100D.dll and MVCR100D.dll. p  pBelow is an example of the code that fails. tcmalloc gets called for all of the memory allocations but when delete is called the application crashes. It is really puzzling to me as the exact same code works fine when I created a function in the main executable and copied the code there.p  pIf anyone has any experience with using tcmalloc in this type of situation I would appreciate your feedback. It is a mystery to me. Is it a memory model issue with the dlls different heaps    I dont know. It seems to me they are using the same heap. p  pSorry if this post is too long. I was trying to give as much info as possible.p  pThank you.p  pBrucep  pUpdate As a test I changed the shared dll where it was crashing to a static library and everything worked fine until the application used a different dll. So for whatever reason tcmalloc requires some additional steps to handle shared dlls.

On iPads, the popup window seems to close itself in all cases, but in iPhones, the popup window does not close, and only sometimes the user is returned to the original page.p  pWe originally saw this problem on www.expertflyer.commobile, where we send off an AJAX request once the Facebook login is complete. We found that the code that should execute when that AJAX request returns is never executed. This is shown more simply using the setTimeout call in the FB Rell example, but the commonality is that asynchronous code is not executed after the Facebook login returns. This was working previously, and we have not made any changes to our code, and this works as expected in earlier versions of iOS and on Android.p

I had some trouble getting it to work at first. My error was related to file output size of 0 bytes. I started debugging and the culprit turned out to be record.prepare. I was not setting a new outputfile for the recorder so it was overwriting my existing video every time I touched the screen to stop the video recording. Hope this helps someone else out there  By the way it is worth mentioning that you also need to add RECORDAUDIO, CAMERA and WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE permissions to your manifest for this sample code to work.p  pCan someone show me how to do it p  pIn general what I want to do is when recording or maybe without recoding when the device is on camera video mode so it will show me the video im looking at on the small videoView1 window.p

Negative 3847 pI am responsible for maintaining a bunch of legacy code which involves several deployed servlets some through Tomcat 5.5 yes I know  I did say legacy code and others through Glassfish 3.3.  All connect using the ojdbc14 driver, to Oracle 10 databases.  All use pooled connections.  p  pHowever, occasionally, the connection to the DB is dropped, the DB restarts, etc., and the servlets fail until someone notices and they are redeployed.  Not.  Cool.  I understand there is some way to monitor the DB connection the servlet makes, so that, in the event of a lost connection, the servlet knows  how do I accomplish this  And, can I make the servlet smart enough to recover itself by reinstigating the DB conection   Ive searched around for an answer, but I have not been successful.  Suggestions and pointers muchly appreciated.. Im a bit of a newbie at this. Thanks  p

To be independent of the libraries internals as much as possible i want to use some of these macros in python.p  pOne of these macros looks like thisp  precode using the ctypes types myuint16t  cushort myuint32t  culong  def mymacrox return myuint16tmyuint32tx gtgt 16  macro codepre  pI want to use the generated function in a seperate module in the following way inside a functionp  precodereturn wrapper.mymacrovalueToBeConverted  valueToBeConverted is an int codepre  pBut using this line i got the following errorp  precode....    def mymacrox return myuint16tmyuint32tx gtgt 16  macro TypeError unsupported operand types for gtgt culong and int codepre  pI know that the common way to shift a culong is codeculongvar.value gtgt xcode but i would have to patch the generated wrapper every time something changes in the C library. So i try to avoid this.p  pIt seems that the codershiftcode implementation of culong can not be used here.p  precodeprint culong.rshift  throws AttributeError type object culong has no attribute rshift codepre  pHm, seems strange... So i decided to reimplement the codershiftcode method of culong to get it workingp  precodefrom ctypes import  from types import MethodType  def rshiftself, val     print self.value gtgt val   create an unbound method which applies to all even existing instances culong.rshift  MethodTypershift, None, culong  a  culong1 a gtgt 16 codepre  pBut it does not fix the problem. I am still getting an errorp  precodea gtgt 16 TypeError unsupported operand types for gtgt culong and int codepre  pIs it possible that the codershiftcode method can be only used for two instances of the same class I tried the followingp  precodedef rshiftself, val     print self.value gtgt intval.value  a  culong1 a gtgt culong16  codepre  pand it works. But it would also mean i would still have to patch the generated wrapper.p  pSo Does anybody know whats the trick herep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe solution of eryksun worked. I am usingp  precodefrom ctypes import   from types import MethodType  def rshiftself, other     if hasattrother, value         other  other.value     return culongself.value gtgt other  def lshiftself, other     if hasattrother, value         other  other.value     return culongself.value ltlt other  def coerceself, other     try         return self, self.classother     except TypeError         return NotImplemented   Add the functions to the type.

Negative 3847 pI currently have two forms. The first form has a dataGridView on it, the second form has six text boxes and a button. On the button click the information is taken from the text boxes and put into the dataGridView. The problem I am having is that when I exit the application and run the application again there is no data shown in the dataGridView. How can I resolve thisp  pIs there a way to save the information inputted into the dataGridView or would I have to make a data table and store the information from the text boxes in there and then use that as a data source for the dataGridViewp

Negative 3847 pWould it be good practicestyle to embed design pattern names into appropriate interface lets say if its a decorator design pattern have the abstract decorator be named codeIDecorateInterfaceNamecode or codeAbstractClassNameDecoratorcode if abstract class is used for the pattern. As example java IO classes use decorator pattern but name the Abstract Decorator class just codeFilterInputStreamcode instead of adding the pattern name somewhere in the name. Or does it become redundant to add this type of information if sufficient documentation is provided It just seemed to me that it would be easier to catch on which patterns are used just by looking at code if this convention is followed throughout but the fact that APIs didnt follow such a rule is throwing me off.p

Negative 3847 pIn R, the codemcparallelcode function in the codeparallelcode package forks off a new task to a worker each time it is called. If my machine has N physical cores, and I fork off 2N tasks, for example, then each core starts off running two tasks, which is not desirable. I would rather like to be able to start running N tasks on N workers, and then, as each tasks finishes, submit the next task to the nowavailable core. Is there an easy way to do this p  pMy tasks take different amounts of time, so it is not an option to fork off the tasks serial in batches of N. There might be some workarounds, such as checking the number of active cores and then submitting new tasks when they become free, but does anyone know of a simple solutionp  pI have tried setting codecl lt makeForkClusternnodesNcode, which does indeed set N cores going, but these are not then used by codemcparallelcode. Indeed, there appears to be no way to feed codeclcode into codemcparallelcode. The latter has an option codemc.affinitycode, but its unclear how to use this and it doesnt seem to do what I want anyway and according to the documentation its functionality is machine dependent.p

Negative 3847 pI am working in android 2.3 and I have an issue which is a bit of a pain.p  pI have 2 layouts on top of each other in a codeFrameLayoutcode. The top layout is moved partly offscreen during an animation, and the code.layoutcode method is called in the animation end. This works great and the ui is moved correctly and the buttons of the toplayout is still clickable. After the animation the second layout is visible as the toplayout is moved offscreen. This layout contains a list which is clickable and each cell has an codeImageViewcode which is updated when clicked. However my problem is, when the table cell is clicked and the codeImageViewcode is updated, the entire view is reset, ignorering the animation and new location of the toplayout. It just sets the toplayout back on top as the animation never happend.p  pI use an codeTranslateAnimationcode and the set fillafter is set to true as well.p  pDo you guys have any suggestions to what I might be missing.p

Negative 3847 pOkay. My original question turned out to be caused by not initializing some arrays. The original issue had to do with code crashing R. When I was trying to debug it by commenting things out, I by mistake commented out the lines that initialized the arrays. So I thought my problem had to do with passing pointers. p  pThe actual problem is this. As I said before, I want to use codeouterposcode to calculate outer differences and pass both the pointers of the results and the total number of positive differences back to a function that calls codeouterposcodep  precodeinclude ltR.hgt include ltRmath.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltmath.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt   void outerposdouble x, double y, int n, double output     int i, j, l0     fori0 iltn i         forj0 jltn j             ifx[j]x[i]gt0                 output[l1]y[j]y[i]x[j]x[i]                 output[0]doublel                                 Rprintfdn, intoutput[0]    void foo1double x, double y, int nsamp     int i, j, k, oper2, l     double v1v2mallocsizeofdoublensampnsamp12  1      outerposx, y, nsamp, ampv1v2[0]     double v1v2b[1999000]     ltHERE     fori1 ilt intv1v2[0] i         v1v2b[i1]1       codepre  pSuppose codefoo1code is the function that calls codeouterposcode. Here I specified the size of the array codev1v2bcode using an actual number 1999000. This value corresponds to the number of positive differences. Calling codefoo1code from R causes no problem. Its all fine. p  pIn the scenario above, I know the number of positive differences, so I can use the actual value to set the array size. But I would like to accommodate situations where I dont necessarily know the value. codefoo2code below is intended to do that. As you can see, codev1v2bcode is initialized using the first value of the array codev1v2code. Recall that the first slot of the output of codeouterposcode stores the number of positive differences. So basically I use this value to set codev1v2codes size. However, calling this function in R causes R to either show a stack overflow error or causes it to crash see screen shot belowp  precodevoid foo2double x, double y, int nsamp     int i, j, k, oper2, l     double v1v2mallocsizeofdoublensampnsamp12  1      outerposx, y, nsamp, ampv1v2[0]     double v1v2b[intv1v2[0]]        ltHERE     fori1 ilt intv1v2[0] i         v1v2b[i1]1       codepre  pSo I thought, maybe it has to do with indexation. Maybe the actual size of v1v2b is too small, or something, so the loop iterates outside the bound. So I created codefoo2bcode in which I commented out the loop, and use codeRprintfcode to print the first slot of codev1v2code to see if the value stored in it is correct. But it seems that the value codev1v2[0]code is correct, namely 1999000. So I dont know what is happening here. p  pSorry for the confusion with my previous questionp  precodevoid foo2bdouble x, double y, int nsamp         int i, j, k, oper2, l         double v1v2mallocsizeofdoublensampnsamp12  1          outerposx, y, nsamp, ampv1v2[0]         double v1v2b[intv1v2[0]]         ltArray size declared by a variable        Rprintfd, intv1v2[0]         fori1 ilt intv1v2[0] i             v1v2b[i1]v1v2[i]           codepre  h1R code to run the code aboveh1  precodexrnorm2000 yrnorm2000 .Cfoo1, xas.doublex, yas.doubley, nsampas.integer2000 .Cfoo2, xas.doublex, yas.doubley, nsampas.integer2000 .Cfoo2b, xas.doublex, yas.doubley, nsampas.integer2000 codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKsxrJ.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comD8GyJ.png altenter image description herep  p  FOLLOW UP  p  pI modified my code based on Martins suggestion to check if the stack overflow issue can be resolvedp  precodevoid foo2bdouble x, double y, int nsamp      int n  nsamp, i     double v1v2, v1v2b      v1v2  double  Rallocn  n  1  2  1, sizeofdouble      outerposx, y, nsamp, v1v2      v1v2b  double  Rallocsizet v1v2[0], sizeofint     fori0 ilt intv1v2[0] i         v1v2b[i]1          qsortv1v2b, sizet v1v2[0], sizeofdouble, mycompare      ...   codepre  pAfter compiling it, I ran the codep  precodexrnorm1000 yrnorm1000 .Cfoo2b, xas.doublex, yas.doubley, nsampas.integerlengthx codepre  pAnd got an error message      Error cannot allocate memory block of size 34359738368.0 Gbp  p  FOLLOW UP 2 p  pIt seems that the error message shows up every other run of the function.

Negative 3847 pI have a number of dataclips in Heroku PostgreSQL that call for a data range, over multiple relations. For data of the past week, I have something like the following queryp  precodeSELECT x, y, ts FROM    SELECT x1 as x, y1 as y, t1.mytimestamp as ts     FROM t1, t2   WHERE ... t1.mytimestampdate gt CURRENTTIMESTAMP  interval 8 daydate  UNION   SELECT x2 as x, y2 as y, t3.mytimestamp as ts     FROM t3, t4   WHERE ... t3.mytimestampdate gt CURRENTTIMESTAMP  interval 8 daydate  UNION   ...etc...  ORDER BY ts DESC codepre  pIs there a way to save a string like this as a variable, so to change the date range ie 8 day  366 day over all queries Id only need to change the string once rather than for each incidence Ive found some threads that say to declare the variable within a function, but for some reason nothing seems to work. p  pIn herokus docs it just says use standard SQL  are functions  variables not a standard sql feature Any advice appreciated, thxp

Negative 3847 pIm having trouble designing a responsive website. Up until now Ive always worked with a fixed width of 1024px. By doing so, Ive avoided annoying responsive designs. But its time to changep  pFirst of all, sId like my page to be 1024px wide maximum, but when the page gets narrowed the content needs to be narrowed as well. Issue Im currently having is that using codemaxwidthcode messes up the codemarginautocode since the page needs to be centered.sp  pOn my page Id like a leftcolumn that contains a box, and to the right of that would be different boxes. The whole thing should be centered in the page, but when using codemarginautocode on the boxes, I cant add a margin so they dont press against each other. I also cant find a way to get the left box on the left and avoid other boxes displaying underneath it. Ive made some mockups of what the page should look like emNote header doesnt need to be 1024px wide anymoreemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSnRGs.png altFull pagep  pHere you can see the viewport orange border and layout. The green block should take up the whole height on that side of the page, so the other blocks wont go under it. When the page gets narrowed, it should look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZndcR.png altNarrow pagep  pYou can see the elements should still be centered on the page, and again the green block should be to the left of the other blocks having a full page height.p  pExtra In case this is less an effort than I predicted Ive been messing around for days, the green box should, when scrolled, stay on the page as in the following imageimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comD044q.png altScrolled full pagep  pstrongHeres the current codestrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netG5pWw3 relnofollowjsfiddleap  pI know its a lot of images and a wall of text, but I have no idea how to get started on this...p

Negative 3847 pI have a class that was taking in lists of 1s and 0s and performing GF2 finite field arithmetic operations. It used to work until I tried to make it take the input in polynomial format.  As for how the finite arithmetic will be done after fixing the regex issue, I was thinking about overloading the operators.p  pThe actual code in codeparsePolyToListInputinputcode works when outside the class. The problem seems to be in the regex, which errors that it will only take in a string this makes sense, but does not seem to initialize with self.expr as a parameter thats a problem.  The staticmethod just before the initialization was an attempt to salvage the unbound error as it the polynomial was passed in, but this is apparently completely wrong.

I might use this class in other projects and not just the asp.net MVC project.p  pI have a codeKittenControllercode which should fetch the latest fluffy kittens at codeKittenscode.

Negative 3847 pYou can set a codeTextViewcodes codeinputTypecode to one of the values from codeInputTypecode to hint that the typedin text should be a persons name, phone number, ampc. Even if the input method doesnt respect this hint, the codeTextViewcode uses a codeKeyListenercode andor codeTransformationMethodcode to ensure that only relevant characters can be entered, or to have effects like masking the password. Even the flags are more than just hints they can change the behaviour of the codeTextViewcode significantly the most obvious example being codeEditorInfo.TYPETEXTFLAGMULTILINEcode.p  pGoogles documentation is very vague about the actual effect of each codeinputTypecode. What characters are actually permitted in each case How does this vary by locale, if at all Even if there is no emdocumentedem answer, and its liable to change between versions, Id still like to know the expected behaviour.p

Negative 3847 pMy question is related to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq30778661311956more general questiona on Haskell program design. But I would like to focus on a specific use case. p  pI defined a data type e.g. codeFoocode, and used it in a function e.g. codefcode through pattern matching. Later, I realized that the type codeFoocode requires some additional field to support new functionalities. However, adding the field would change how the type can be used i.e. the existing functions depending on the type could be affected. Adding new functionalities to existing code, however unappealing, is hard to avoid. I am wondering what are the best practices at the Haskell language level to minimize the impact of such kind of modifications.p  pFor example, the existing code isp  precodedata Foo  Foo    vv  [Int]   f  Foo gt Int f Foo v  sum v codepre  pThe function codefcode will be syntax wrong if I add another field to codeFoocodep  precodedata Foo  Foo    vv  [Int]   uu  [Int]  codepre  pHowever, if I had defined function codefcode as the following in the first placep  precodef  Foo gt Int f foo  sum  vv foo codepre  p, then even with the modification on codeFoocode, codefcode would still be correct.p

Negative 3847 pI have a static UITableview and am trying to segue to a modal view. I cant segue directly from the cell in storyboard as there is times when I would like the segue not to be invoked depending of some application logic. So I have hooked the segue up to the TableViewController and given it an identifier in storyBoard.In the TableViewController I then call the method below.p  precode             voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath Perform segue when first row in first section is touched ifindexPath.section  0     ifindexPath.row  0         [self performSegueWithIdentifierview1 senderself.view]      codepre  pfor some reason when the cell is tapped the modal view is really slow to appear. I have added NSLogs to the modal views viewDidLoad and viewDidAppear methods, The viewDidLoad is called instantly but viewDidAppear is slow.This seems to only happen when the cell is tapped for the first time after the tableView has loaded. It seems to be something to do with the didSelectRowAtIndex method as I have tried calling the performSegueWithIdentifier from an IBAction triggered from a button on the cell and it works great. Another point to mention if I uncheck the animates checkBox on the segue it works instantly. If anyone could help I would be most grateful.  p

Negative 3847 pWe have a asp.net web form developed in C. This form has around 100 fields and its very dynamic form. Its  dynamic in the sense, when you first start you see only about 20 fields,but as you go on making differnt selctions in the forms, panels containging fields are displayed or hidden. Almost each field is validated on the client side using .net validators. Javascript is used to turn onoff validators depending on if the panel they are in is visiable or not.p  pThis form has some bugs and its pain in the rear to debug this form because almos every field has at least 2 validators  require andregular experssion. Also some of the fields when selected do autopostback. most often users cannot submit the form because onemore validators are still enable but the fields that they are attached to are invisible so its hard to debug as which validtor is causing the problem.p  pSo here my design question. p  ul liWhat is the easier way to debug validators in this case How to find which validtors are still onli liInstead of using asp.net validators, Should I just recode the form and use JavaScript for validation, at least that way it will be esierbr to debug validtors.li liAny design consideration Since this form is such a pain, we wont mind redesigning it, and doing it the right way.li ul  pI was thinking what if I create a single JavaScript function that is called every time a form field is either clicked or changed, this JavaScript function will be called and it will check all 100 form fields. If the form field is visible, the corresponding validator is enabled, otherwise disabled. p  pWhat do you think of the approachp  pThanks for your time and advice in advance.p

Negative 3847 pI have heard and read quite a bit on the Grails framework. I understand from their website that its a framework designed to target the Groovy language.p  pGrails looks like a framework more suitable for small to medium applications than frameworks like Spring and Struts which need too many configurations to setup.

Negative 3847 pSo i have been looking into some of the technologies that implement multiple threads per core like intels hyperthreading and I am wondering whats the extent of parallelism in these kinds of technologies. Is it true parallelism or just more effective concurrency It seems they still share the same execution units and core resources, basically seems like its just virtualizing the usage. So I am unsure how true parallelism could occur. And if this is the case then what is the benefit You can achieve concurrency through effective thread context switching.p

Negative 3847 pOne of our apps needs to grab the Router IP and Mac address for submitting a ticket to our support team, I am having an issue as one of the services we provide to our customers, is a compression service to help them save on bandwidth.  This service works with the router, and thus, the gateway address, is the compression mechanism, and not the router itself.  All of the Get gateway address code examples I have found work, and successfully get the Gateway address, I also successfully see the router IP address in the ARP table.. however, it just appears another device in the ARP table.  Is there any way to pull the Router IP address when it is NOT the same as the Gateway IP address  Generally in our setup, they are 1 IP address away from each other, but this is not guaranteed.p

Negative 3847 pI would like to implement a strongrestore list view statestrong function on android. The idea is I save the codegetFirstVisiblePositioncode when the onPause function called, and use codesetSelectioncode to restore the state when the onResume function called scroll down a litter bit to match the codegetFirstVisiblePositioncode. The code looks like thisp  precodeOverride protected void onPause      selectedItemPosition  listView.getFirstVisiblePosition     getSharedPreferencesTAG, MODEPRIVATE             .edit             .putIntlistselection, selectedItemPosition             .commit     super.onPause   Override protected void onResume      super.onResume     final int newSelection  getSharedPreferencesTAG, MODEPRIVATE.getIntlistselection, 0     if newSelection  selectedItemPosition          selectedItemPosition  newSelection         listView.postnew Runnable              Override             public void run                  listView.setSelectionselectedItemPosition                             codepre  pI assume that it would works well when using an codeArrayAdaptercode, but when using a codeCursorAdaptercode. The setSelection method will be called when codecursorAdapter.getCount  0code, which makes the codesetSelectioncode not working. p  pSo my question is how to make this codesetSelectioncode working with codeCursorAdaptercodep

Negative 3847 pIve got some questions about the Spark framework. p  pFirst, if I want to write some applications that runs on spark clusters, is it unavoidable to follow the mapreduce procedure Since to follow the mapreduce procedure, lots of codes has to be changed to parallelize forms, Im looking for some simple way to move current project to cluster with little changes in codes.p  pSecond is about the sparkshell. Ive tried to launch the sparkshell on a cluster using the following code codeMASTERsparkIPPORT .binsparkshellcode. Then I write some scala codes on the sparkshell,for examplep  precodevar count10 var ntimes10000 var index0 whileindexltntimes  index1 val t1  Math.random val t2  Math.random if t1t1  t2t2 lt 1          count11  var pi 4.0  count1  ntimes  val count2  spark.parallelize1 to NUMSAMPLES.mapi gt   val x  Math.random   val y  Math.random   if xx  yy lt 1 1 else 0 .reduce   printlnPi is roughly   4.0  count2  NUMSAMPLES codepre  pThese codes contain two different Pi caculation programs. Im wandering whether all of these codes runs on the cluster. I guess that only these codes surrounded by the map function are executed on cluster while other codes only executed on the master node. but Im not sure whether thats correct.p
Negative 3847 pI have a portion of my web application that uses AJAX. I am using the JQuery AJAX call to add and remove items from the users shopping cart, and it works fine. The URL that I pass as a parameter in the AJAX call is the urlmapping defined in the web.xml file, minus the leading forward slash. p  pI tried to replicate this with another place in the application where I would like to use AJAX, but this time, the Servlet GET is not even being called at all. I have alerts in the javascript function, so I know the function is being called. Is there a way that I can see within the ajax function call what the fully qualified URL is that the GET request is being made to Also, what is the rule with respect to the AJAX URL Is there a way that I can get to the context root My Servlet is mapped to www.mydomain.comcontextRootunp  pI would rather not have to hardcode the context root into the function call, that way if it ever changes, I dont have to update all my javascript functions.p

Negative 3847 pWith the release of Android L, Im making an application that will utilize BLE in both modes. Some phones will be in the peripheral mode i.e. GATT Servers, other phones will be in the central mode i.e. GATT Clients. Exactly how each phone determines whether to be a client or a server is irrelevant.p  pThe problem I run in to is that at one point, the GATT Servers will have to start pushing information to GATT Clients, and then have the GATT Clients respond. While I looked through the specifications and it says that communication is twoway, Im not sure if this is a supported mode of communication. The obvious choice would be to reverse which roles play the server and client, but unfortunately the applications requirements prevent me from doing that as the role that uses the GATT Client mode needs to maintain connections to multiple devices at once. p  pIs there a welldefined way for me to have GATT Servers push data to GATT Clients Alternatively, is there a different option perhaps use some sort of flag to establish a traditional Bluetooth connection that would be a better optionp

Negative 3847 pI have an codeunorderedmapltint, customobject gtcode and have various shared pointers pointing to every entry in the codeunorderedmapcode.

If I do a printf in the matmult method the matrix entries are just fine.p  pWhy is the C matrix in the main method not showing correctly Also the way I am freeing the memory, is it the right methodp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  void matmultint p, int q, int r, int numP      int i, j, k, sumC0      for i  0 i lt numP i              for j  0 j lt numP j                      for k  0 k lt numP k                              sumC  sumC  p[inumP  k]q[knumP  j]                          r[inumP  j]  sumC             sumC  0                   fori  0 i lt 3 i              for j  0 j lt 3 j                      printfd , r[inumP  j]                  printfn        int main      int A[3][3]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9     int B[3][3]  3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7       int i, j     int sizA  sizeofAsizeofA[0]      int C[3][3]  0       sizA is the width of the array      int C  callocsizA, sizeofint     fori  0 i lt sizA i               sizA is the height          C[i]  callocsizA, sizeofint           fori  0 i lt 3 i              for j  0 j lt 3 j                      printfd , C[i][j]                  printfn          matmultA[0], B[0], C[0], sizA       fori  0 i lt 3 i              for j  0 j lt 3 j                      printfd , A[i][j]                  printft         for j  0 j lt 3 j                      printfd , B[i][j]                  printft         for j  0 j lt 3 j                      printfd , C[i][j]                  printfn          freeC[0]     freeC     return 0  codepre  pHere is the output from the program above.p  precode0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 42 36 30 96 81 66 150 126 102 1 2 3   3 2 1   42 36 30 4 5 6   6 5 4   150 126 102 7 8 9   9 8 7   0 0 0  Process returned 1073741819 0xC0000005   execution time  12.472 s Press any key to continue. codepre  pstrongPROBLEM RESOLVEDstrongp  pJayeshp  pThank you very much friend.

Negative 3847 pIm trying to get into game dev with SpriteKit for iOS, and Im following a book called strongiOS Games By Tutorialsstrong by emRay Wenderleichem. p  pRight now Im working on a platform game, but Im getting some weird results when trying to do something not in the book.p  pBasically I have a functioning platform game that loads the level from a JSONfile, and lays out bricks nodes in a background layer. I want to have  multiple strongfloorsstrong, so when a user jumps through a portal in the game, a new floor level is loaded and placed on screen in the exact same position all floors are the same size. p  pI didnt think I would have any troubles with this, as being notified when the user jumps through the portal is really easy. And Im already loading a level to begin with, so loading another one at this time and replacing the original one shouldnt be hard.p  pHowever, its proving to be very difficult. strongWhen the game loads I call this methodstrongp  precode voidcreateWorld    bgLayer  [self createScenery[NSNumber numberWithInteger1]]    worldNode  [SKNode node]   [worldNode addChildbgLayer]   [self addChildworldNode]    self.anchorPoint  CGPointMake0.5, 0.5   worldNode.position  CGPointMakebgLayer.layerSize.width  2, bgLayer.layerSize.height  2  codepre  pThis initializes a level floor 1 from a JSON file, which basically is just a number of 32x32 nodes positioned next to each other forming a map. It then creates a codeworldNodecode, adds the codebgLayercode to the codeworldNodecode, and then adds it to the screen. Later it centers the codeworldNodecode on the screen. The codeworldNodecode is the node that moves when the player moves, the codebgLayercode is always stationary. p  pstrongWhen the user jumps through a portal, I call this methodstrongp  precode voidgoingUp    if isChangingFloor return     isChangingFloor  YES    [bgLayer removeFromParent]   bgLayer  nil   [worldNode removeFromParent]   worldNode  nil    bgLayer  [self createScenery[NSNumber numberWithInteger0]]   worldNode  [SKNode node]   [worldNode addChildbgLayer]   [self addChildworldNode]    worldNode.position  CGPointMakebgLayer.layerSize.width  2, bgLayer.layerSize.height  2  codepre  pThis method wasnt always this full, as I thought I could just replace codebgLayercode with the new one. That didnt work, so now Im trying to reset everything, to replicate what happens in the codecreateWorldcode method at start. However, this doesnt work either... p  pstrongThis is the result I get after jumping through the portalstrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comA9zKD.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, theres 1 node onscreen, however the debuginfo says there are 446. I believe this is the total number of nodes on the entire floor, but only around 90100 should be visible at a time. Ive tried adding removing nodes from the level, which increases decreases this number.p  pSo as you all probably can understand, Im really confused. Why doesnt it simply replace the old background with a new one when I jump through a portal Theres nothing wrong with the JSONfile itself, as Ive tried loading codefloor0code in at start, and that works fine. Why isnt the behavior the same when jumping through the portal as when I initially load the game What is different here Why does it say 446 nodes onscreen when theres clearly only 1. Why is there only 1 node on the screenp  pIve been stuck on this for several days now, and I would really appreciate any help that would get me closer to a solution. Thanks in advancep

Negative 3847 pLets say Im writing a Spring webservice that gets called by an external application. That application requests data that I need to load from an external resource. Furthermore, the design has it that it calls my service more than once with different parameters. In other words, the user sitting in front of the application presses one button, which generates a bunch of requests to my webservice in a very short time frame.p  pMy webservice parses the parameters and comes up with necessary requests to the external resource. The logic has it that it may cause calling the external resource with the same parameters over and over again, which makes this the ideal candidate for caching.p  pExamplep  ol liThe user presses that one button in the applicationli liApplication initiates ten requests to my webserviceli liMy webservice receives them in parallelli liAfter analysing the parameters of all requests, overall Id need to call the external resources 15 times, but the parameters are mostly equal and only show that three calls would be enough to serve the 15 intended calls.li ol  pHowever, one call to the external resource may take some time.p  pAs far as I understand a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs4.0.6.RELEASEspringframeworkreferencehtmlsinglecache relnofollowhow Spring does cachinga it writes the result of a codeCachablecode method into the cache. Apparently this means that before it treats another invocation of that method with the same parameters as cache hit, it must have a result of a previous invocation. This means that it doesnt provide support for pending method calls.p  pI need something like Hey, I just saw a method invocation with the same parameters a second ago, but Im still waiting for the result of that invocation. While I cant provide a result yet, I will hold that new invocation and reuse the result for it.p  pWhat are my options Can I make Spring do thatp

Negative 3847 pIve found myself growing the habit of keeping the codeTaskcode objects well beyond their completion as result containers. p  pSo far I havent identified any drawbacks and I find the code clearer than having separate variables to store the result after the tasks are completed.p  pA couple usage examples follow. Although I dont think it is really relevant, they have been though as part of View Models in MVVM applications.  Please note that this is not actual working code, I only try to outline the pattern.p  ul lipstrongEarly initializationstrongp  pA codeSlowClientcode is some class requiring a few seconds to connect to a WCF or REST service. Thus, I initialize it as soon as possible through a task. When the client is required, the task is awaited, yielding the initialized codeSlowClientcode either immediately if the task is done or after waiting for its completion. p  pSo  Id do something like thisp  precodepublic class SomeViewModel     private TaskltSlowClientgt slowClientInitializerTask     public SomeViewModel           slowClientInitializerTask  Task.Run gt CreateAndInitSlowClient         private SlowClient CreateAndInitSlowClient            SlowClient instantiation and initialization, taking a few seconds...          Task result consumer example    void OnSomeCommandExecutedobject parameter           try                 var client  await slowClientInitializerTask           do something with the client        catch            may recreate the task if the client ceases to be valid             codepre  pAs exemplified by codeOnSomeCommandExecutedcode, every method using codeSlowClientcode will simply dop  precodevar client  await slowClientInitializerTask codepre  pIf for some reason the result ceases to be valid the connection to the service being dropped or what not, Id just run a new task and assign it to codeslowClientInitializerTaskcode  just like in the code shown in the constructor.p  pThe alternative to this pattern would be to create some extra codeslowClientcode variable that is  updated once the task is completed, thus requiring a check every time it is going to be used. For instance p  precodeif slowClient  null     slowClient  await slowClientInitializerTask codepre  pI see no benefit, only increased complexity.pli lipstrongBackground workersstrongp  pA more complex example uses tasks to process images, creating a new file containing a resized image. A report including these images must be generated it accesses the image files through their  paths and it must use the resized versions whenever possible  if it is not, then the original images are used instead. Thus, I need to be able map the path of the original images to their resized versions.p  precode Key original image path Value task returning the resized image path private Dictionaryltstring, Taskltstringgtgt resizeTasks   Costly operation gt Want to execute it asynchronously private string ResizeImagestring originalImagePath      returns the path of a temporary resized image file    Command execution handler for instance gt Launches image resize on background void OnAddImageExecutedobject parameter      string path  parameter as string     if resizeTasks.Keys.Containspath         resizeTasks[path]  Task.Run gt ResizeImagepath    Generates a report consuming the images gt Requires the result of the tasks void OnGenerateReportExecutedobject parameter     try        foreach var faulted in from entry in resizeTasks                                where entry.Value.IsFaulted select entry.Key         resizeTasks[path]  Task.Run gt ResizeImagepath  Retry        await Task.WhenAllresizeTasks.Values  Wait for completion       catch    Ignore exceptions thrown by tasks such as IO exceptions      var imagePaths  resizeTasks[path].Selectentry gt                       entry.Value.Status  TaskStatus.RanToCompletion                        entry.Value.Result  entry.Key       generate the report requiring the image paths   codepre  pThe actual implementation uses a codeConcurrentDictionarycode since the addition on images is executed asynchronously. Moreover, images can be removed and added again so there is a separate list for the current added images, and the coderesizeTaskscode also serves as a cache of previously resized images.pli ul  pTask disposal is not the topic here, since I could dispose them later and anyways, it seems not necessary in these cases, as stated in a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive2012032510287435.aspx relnofollowthe emDo I need to dispose of Tasksem post from emParallel Programming with .NETem MSDN Blogap  blockquote   pNo.  Dont bother disposing of your tasks, not unless performance or scalability testing reveals that you need to dispose of them based on your usage patterns in order to meet your performance goals.  If you do find a need to dispose of them, only do so when its easy to do so, namely when you already have a point in your code where youre 100 sure that theyre completed and that no one else is using them.p blockquote  pMy concerns are the followingp  ol liIs this a good usage patternli liAre there any drawbacks or pitfalls in it e.g. memory leaks, potential deadlocks, locked pool resources, etc.li liShould I, instead, unwrap the results from the tasks and store those directly thus, in my opinion, increasing the code complexityli ol

Negative 3847 pI and a few other developers are having a an AI competition. Basically, we have a simple board game and weve each written AIs that will be hosted on our own webservices to play against each other.p  pIve got one up and running that is a simple WebApi 2 based service that is published to Azure. My expectation is itll be quiet most of the time, and then suddenly when a game starts, itll receive 200400 requests all potentially very quickly a game can last only a few seconds. The game server and AI communicate with runofthemill JSON POSTs.p  pMy issue is, Azure seems to be throttling the requests. The first few moves happen very fast, and then everything slows down. p  pIm wondering if Azure thinks its a potential DOS attack or something. It can take over a second to get a move back once things slow down. A few points of interestp  ul liThis never happens when hosted locally.li liThere is no database at all.li liIt happens even with a simple test AI that just moves pieces randomly so no compute loadli liIt happens when the game host is also deployed to Azure so its two Azure sites talking to each other.li ul  pSo how can I fix this Is there a setting somewhere Im missing where I can tell Azure this kind of behavior is expected I currently have it as a Shared service, but I tested it as a Basic service before with two instances, and I still was seeing the slowdown. p

Im asking this because I would really like to understand further advanced concepts of javascript, and jQuery. p  pSo what Ive done below is placed the function, and Ill comment in what I know about what the function is doing at where, and then Ill place question marks where Im confused. p  precodefunction validate     array of objeccts used to defined the class selector for each element iterated     with what validation function is be assigned to that specific selector     var fields  [                      selector .notempty,             validations [ isNotEmpty]         ,                      selector .email,             validations [ isNotEmpty, isEmail]         ,                      selector .number,             validations [ isNotEmpty, isNumber]         ,                      selector .numbernoreq,             validations [isNumberNotRequired]         ,                      selector .checked,             validations [isChecked]              ]     remove any classes of haserror from each element traversed before validation begins     .formcontrol.closest.formgroup.removeClasshaserror     defining variables     var i  0, k  0, z  0, j  fields.length, item, selector, fn, info     for loop to traverse the fields array of objects     for i lt j i         item  fields[i]         traversing each field.validation         fork  0 k lt item.validations.length k             fn  item.validations[k] setting fn as a function found in validation             traversing each selector in item             for z  0 z lt item.selector.length z                 selector  item.selector[z] setting the selector                 attempting to set info to the closest form or input group found by the selector                 info  selector.closest.formgroup, .inputgroup                 ifinfo if info contains data                      no idea whats going on below other                     other than its running the validation function that was passed, but why                     is it written like this and what is it doing                     info[fnselector.val  removeClass  addClass]haserror                             codepre  pSo that is the basic question I have for this code where all the question marks are. If someone can clearly answer what is going on, why you write the code like that, what the purpose of it is, and is it benefcial or not, would be fantastic. if you need more clarification I would be happy to provide it. I just want to be able to explain the code to somebody and know what I am talking about instead of trying to have to bs my through it. I think it was Einstein who said, If you cant explain something accurately and to the point, then you truly do not understand it or something like thatp  pThank you in advancep  pEDIT here are the functions that validations traverse throughp  precodevalidation functions function isNotEmptyvalue     return value ampamp .trimvalue.length gt 0  function isEmailvalue     return [stn][wd].[w]2,3.[w]2.testvalue   function isNumbervalue     return d.testvalue     function isNumberNotRequiredvalue     return d.testvalue  value.length lt 1   function isCheckedvalue     var r  false     var name  value.attrname     input[namename.eachfunction     ifthis.ischecked         r  true                      return r  codepre  pSECOND EDITUPDATE We have determined that there is a severe error in the code that allows it not to keep track of the validation and take into account previous validations for input groups, and other related sections. How does this corrected. Im testing items on jsfiddle at the moment I will return when I have restulsp

Negative 3847 pIf a user types their password in the login form on my site as strongPassword1234strong, the corresponding POST variable will contain the string strongPasswordxc2xa71234strong. This string is then hashed and compared with the password hash already in the database.p  pThis wouldnt ordinarily be a problem because this escaping would occur both at the signup and login stages and would therefore still match the hash in the database. However, my site allows logins through a desktop API and this API interprets the string correctly without escaped characters before hashing. Consequently the desktop hash doesnt match and the user therefore cannot login.p  pI know there are a lot of threads on this topic, however I could not find any solutions that dealt with my problem, which may be something to do with the fact that the syntax is xc2xa7 rather than U00A7.p  pThe easiest solution of course would be to escape it on the desktop but I would much rather fix the problem than make everything equally incorrect. Its also easier to update the server than ship multiple app updates out.p

Negative 3847 pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo on Jos his advice i found a few things out. First of all, the program on the network is located in a shared folder on the I drive which is called apps. in this apps folder the unitbeheer folder is located with all its files and stuff. The thing is though, i cant access the I drive on the network and neither can the people that use the program. The I folder is an old virtual shared drive that has no use except of running the unitbeheer program  so exactly what Jos thought. p  pThough some network person has transferred the dos program unitbeheer a long time a go to the XP computer. It seems that he created a  own virtual drive I on this XP computer. And here i COULD look in the I drive, the I drive contains nothing more than the program and files itself which i already copied. So my guess is that all the files of unitbeheer use some direction path to i. p  pI can by the way not get access to the apps file on the network which contains the program and neither can i have access to the I drive so i have to simulate everything in my testing environment my windows 8 pc. p  pSince the I drive just contained the programfiles i thought to be smart and create a virtual I drive myself on the computer so i did see picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBvf0f.png altown created i drivep  pI thought perhaps most of the errors were gone since i am running the program now from the I driver but when i launch the shortcut of the program it says that the shortcut it refers to is unavailable.. So i removed the unitbeheer folder and just copied all the files in the folder directly to I. Now when i launch the shortcut it says that it doesnt work on a 64 bit pc, so what we already knew and what i needed the DOSbox program for.. this gave me the idea that now the shortcut works. p  pThough when running it now on dosbox i still get the error that ub.dbo doesnt exist so creating a I driver doesnt work. p  pFor Jos other questions  solutions I dont quite know how to do it with the start in folder and target to.. at least i kinda know what you mean the start in folder is the folder from where it runs but i am not sure if its good in the current way. When i look at the original shortcut from XP the start in of the shortcut  I and the target  IUb.BAT this is why i removed the unitbeheer folder in my own created I drive since the target is immediately set to the program launcher. I just left the target and start in as it is now since i created a own I driver or i just mounted it to a I driver.p  pThen the part about not using DROPbox, good advice since i dont want to mess up important database stuff Though when i try it to run with Vbox it doesnt quite work. I am mounting it in I by using USE I i then i am trying to cd unitbeheer folder but this doesnt work, neither does cd unitbe1 works max 8 char. When copied in I without the folder i try to do USE I i and then just fire the program by calling the shortcut unitbeheer.lnk or directly the program UB.BAT but this both doesnt work... p  pI hope you can get me a bit further Thank you in advancep  pstrongEND UPDATEstrongp  pThe last 13 years a friend of my is using a program called unitbeheer unit management which is a DOS program with some kind of database DOS. What the program does is quite easy, it has all this information about locations that are being hired costs, duration, etc. and we can either add information to it or retrieve it and print it out. Although the program has some more to it, that is basically what it does.p  pThe thing is that it is now running on a windows xp pc and i want to migrate it to a windows 8 pc. I am perhaps in over my head with this but i have read a bit about how to do it and found out that i could use the DOSbox application to run DOS programs on 64 bits systems my windows 8. So it is all working fine, i have mounted my driver and ran the program.p  pSo the program and its belonging files, as well its query  database files are all copied to my pc.p  pNow when i am running the program i am getting a few errors which i can not figure out. Firstly, when i mount the program files to my c driver where it is also copied to and run the program, i am getting the error strongno validate station I set dire to istrong p  pWhen i look at what the program does that is being executed it seems to go to the folder DBASE5 with cd DBASE5 and then runs a file called DBASE UB.PRG. First of all, no such file is in that folder, there are however 2 separate files one being DBASE.EXE and one being UB.PRG. Apart from that, i was curious what was in the UB file so i opened it with notepad. This is the code that is in that folderp  precodeset dire to i do ub.dbo  codepre  pub.dbo is another file with the same name obviously but a different extension. I thought to go around this problem by mounting my driver to I. This is by the way my mounting code with i as driver in DOSboxp  precodemount i cDOSfiles i cd unitbe1 UB.BAT codepre  punitbe1 is the folder where the DOS program is in and DOSfiles is a folder i made to put it in and UB.BAT is the program that needs to be executed. p  pThis worked kinda but lead me to another problem, now i am getting the error message strongFile doesnt exist ub.dbostrong. This is rather strange since the file is there in the folder.. and when i open it with notepad i get this weird code that i dont understandp  precodeDBO          9                                                ub.prg F P SampOI ub.dbo                        ub.dbo                     h                ub        ub.prg    codepre  pAt this point i am getting stuck.. Does any of you perhaps know what is going wrong Its perhaps a hard question without detailed information about the program so i will try to upload as mich information belowp  pBackground The program is being ran on a companys network, since i see this program today for the first time with the explanation about what it does i am not sure on which driver it exactly runs but i guess it is I. Neither do i know what other perhaps related files are on there will know this tomorrow though. p  pFurthermore i made some screenshots of all the files dont mind the notepad open with.. its now the default for some extensions..  notice there are 2 screenshots of the files of the program in the general map and 2 of the DBASE5 map which is also located as a map in the program files. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVPFSc.png altThe files of the unitbeheer programp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combVdmC.png altMore files of the unitbeheer program including the launching filep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwRNJ5.png altThe DBASE5 map imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQ2Hs1.png altThe DBASE5 map image with the 2 files that are causing the errorsp  pI hope this is enough input.

Negative 3847 pI am making my first app using Parse.com for database storage, and I am using the Parse JavaScript SDK to make use of this database.p  pI am trying to populate a list of items from one of my database tables, and this table contains a field which is a pointer to an object of another classtable. I need to retrieve a field from this object in order to display the information properly.p  pHowever, Parse seems to require me to request each of these objects separately from my main query on the table. Anyway, so I make the request and have a success callback which uses jquerys code.htmlcode to set the contents of a div which is idd by the id of the retreived object.p  pThe problem is, after the work is done, the div is rendered empty. Although, oddly, I tried using calls to codealertcode to get the contents of each div within the success callback, and the contents was not only correct after I had called code.htmlcode but also embeforeem I called it.

Negative 3847 pFirst of all, I checked every topic similar to my problem, unfortunately, I havent found my answer yet. I tried to combine some of the anwers, but I had no succes. note just started to learn jQueryp  pSo here is my problemp  pI created a form with four text inputs and a button.

Negative 3847 pI currently have two buckets in S3  lets call them codephotoscode and codephotosthumbnailscode. Right now, when a user uploads an image from our iOS app, we directly upload that photo to the codephotoscode bucket, which triggers a lambda function that resizes the photo into a thumbnail and uploads the thumbnail into the codephotosthumbnailscode bucket. p  pI now want to include some image compression for the images in the codephotoscode bucket before a thumbnail is created in the original bucket codephotoscode. However, if I set the compression lambda function to be triggered whenever an object is created in the codephotoscode bucket, it will wind up in a neverending loop of the user uploading the original photo, triggering the compression and placing back in the same bucket, triggering compression again, etc. p  pIs there a way I can intercept this before it becomes a recursive call for image compression Or is the only way to create a third bucket p

However, since codebasecode and codechildcode are template functions, they are located in a header file which is included with every translation unit that uses these classes. That means the compiler should know everything it needs in order to support inlining to my knowledge, since it does not need separate compilation. Ive tried this out, and basically the function isnt inlined, and it doesnt lead to any real performance benefit in addition to function call overhead, I think pipelining gets ruined too. Is there a way to support inlining for this situation Or is there any advice to implement this kind of thingp

Negative 3847 pI have a pretty basic loop that I am using to run some random scenarios. On one of my worksheets I am using the codeRandcode function to generate random numbersscenarios for my workbook. What I am trying to program from there is a macro that refreshes the workbook and the random set of numbers and then deposits my results onto my worksheet each time the scenario is run. Ultimately, Id like to be able to rungenerate 100,000 random scenarios and deposit the results. Here is what Ive coded so farp  precodeSub Run      Application.Calculation  xlCalculationManual     Application.ScreenUpdating  False     Application.DisplayAlerts  False         Dim wksInput As Worksheet, i As Integer      Set wksInput  SheetsInput          For i  2 To 102              Application.Calculate              With wksInput                                 .RangeP amp i.Value  .RangeJ35.Value                 .RangeQ amp i.Value  .RangeK35.Value                 .RangeR amp i.Value  .RangeL35.Value                 .RangeS amp i.Value  .RangeG32.Value             End With                       Next i          Application.ScreenUpdating  True     Application.DisplayAlerts  True  End Sub codepre  pWhat I have here works just fine, except that it takes 23 seconds to run just 100 scenarios. Based on my calculation that would require over 6 hours of run time to get my 100,000 random scenarios. p  pMy question is does anyone know of a clever way to either change the code to run more efficiently or optimize what I already have. I done all the basic things like turning calculation to manual and turning off screenupdating.p  pThanks for your ideas.p

Negative 3847 pI want to establish a linked Server Connection from my Office SQLServer to a web hosted MySQLdatabase.p  pBefore that I tried to Setup a Connection to a copy of this MySQLdatabase on localhost.p  pI created a linked Server in Management Studio pointing to my MySQLdatabase it Looks like thisp  pTesting the strongConnectionstrong was OK, I can see all databases in MySQL.p  pBut when I do a codeSELECTcode on one of the tables in a certain database I get an strongerror 7312strong.p  pWhen I generate a select script by SSMS it Comes up withp  pcodeSelect  from [MYSQLlocalASV].[asvdb]..[descriptions]codep  pnot showing any Schema .. althoug I can connect to the Server.p  pIf I check the tables Schema in MySQL Workbench it Shows the Schema name asvdb.

Negative 3847 pSo I have been using codeItertoolscode in python to make a brute forcing application of sorts. I have managed to get the code working fine and it works perfectly returning all the incorrect answers untill it gets the correct answer.. But I keep reaching a point in my application when it says there is not enough memorysp  pMy code is simple, it imports ascii  lowercase and uppercase from the codestringscode module and it imports product from codeItertoolscode and uses 3 for loops, looping through all the chars definedp  pBut it keeps saying there is not enough memory.. if I was to hazard a guess it is due to the amount of RAM I have 4GB and it not being able to store enough to the Memory, but once it has looped one result why does it not remove that from the memoryp  pThe code isp  precodechars  asciilowercase  asciiuppercase  digits  state  False for i in range6, 16     if state break     try         for x in productchars, repeati             tmp               try                 for z in x                     tmp  z                 print tmp                 if logintmp                     state  True                     break             except Exception as e                 print e                 rawinputAn Error has occured.nFix the issue and press enter to continue.      except Exception  as e         print e         rawinputAn Error has occured.nFix the issue and press enter to continue. codepre  pthe first loop is just for the amount of characters in each string it tests the second loop uses product to loop through characters and iterate through everything so it goes a, b  aa, ab  aaa, aab and so forth and the third loop is because the answers are returned in a tuple and i use that to convert it to a stringp  pThe state variable is so that it does not continue looping after it has found a result and you can probably understand the rest. Except the Try  Except statements, they are just so you dont have to restart every time there is an error giving you a chance to fix it.p  h1My question now ish1  pIs there any way to use itertools product to start from a point eg it usually starting at a but i want it to start at cB1o or what ever elsep  h3Orh3  pIs there any way to stop my memory filling up remove the used values from the memoryp  h1Edith1  precodedef login psw     global url     op.openurl      op.selectformnr0     op.form[email]  email     op.form[pass]  psw      op.submit      if op.title  Facebook         return True     else         return False codepre  pemail is the users inputp

Negative 3847 pOften I have to program microcontrollers in C, because C compilers are often not available, or can not make extremely small code because of various bugs.  But often, OOP syntactic sugar, is very convenient when it comes to making programs for hardware more clearly encapsulated for easy maintenance so I wanted to find out if there was a way to do OOP syntax in C where as much as possible the OOP overhead when not needed could be made to optimize out in a way that is portable. eg That will optimize with gcc targeted for different microcontrollers, or perhaps by using gccs preprocessor and a generic ANSIC compiler if gcc is not available for that microcontroller.p  pI found only threads, like this, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10266559elegantwaytoemulatethispointerwhendoingoopincElegant way to emulate 39this39 pointer when doing OOP in Ca which generally do OOP by embedding pointers into structs but thats not always what I want because it wastes memory when Im not interested in virtual methods, or anything like that.  I can always follow the coding style in the link where those features are needed, but I want to develop techniques for when they are not needed e.g. I just want to be able to program using OOP paradigms, with simple easy to understand code Not necessarily C, though I like C, and still be able to achieve a minimal C program memory usage when some OOP paradigms are not in use.p  pSo, I resorted to experimentation with gcc, and C99, because in general gcc 3.2 or above is available for most platforms and realized that I could use the sizeof and typeof compiler functions from C99 to index classes automatically  a trick of sorts  from an unuseduninitialized union member So classes must be unions with substructs, in order to access a compile time constant lookup table created by macros, which could bind data and methods, and guarantee all type checking. etc. etc. etc.p  peg GCC allows the optimizing out of const structures, and arrays, when their members are only accessed as constant expressions, so I thought I might be able to use that to build a macro based compile time binding system where the OOP overhead is handled in GCC and actually optimizes out of the final binary.p  pWith this system, I can now do variadic macro method calls, like  M a , init, with, any, parameters, 7  which looks up variable as type, call method init, using variable number of parameters... p  pSee code examples below, and try them out  its simpler than the explanation  Use gcc E to see the macro expansions, and note for ANSI only compilers, the typeof operator will have to be replaced by a voidtypecast type checking only works with GCC.p  pThe code is cut and pasteable into a text editor, with filename on first line, and it does compile and run on normal PC systems.p  pAlthough I did succeed in getting rid of individual pointers in every struct to point back to a classs list of methods, which saves memory in a limited memory microcontroller, I wasnt quite able to figure out how to get the compiler to optimize out emunusedem method pointers because I had to use void pointers for the classes to hold them in an array, and those require a memory address address of a struct and a linker instance and dont optimize out.p  pSo I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to improve my solution by making some kind of an eminitializedem method struct which would optimize out have no linker address after compilation, eg when its members are only accessed as constant expressions in the code.   In essence Im needing to be able to look up an element in array where the initialized portion of each array element is a different classXXXmt, rather than a list of addresses to classXXXmt all typecast to void.p  pTheres two other improvements Id like help with if anyone can think of a simple solution  The cpp cpreprocessor doesnt allow defining of new macros from within a previous macro by token concatenation As far as I know, so I have to make fixed length macro lists A maximum of 10 in my example to hold class definitions which means I can only have a maximum of 10 classes in a program but ideally, I would like a way to make my code more generic, so that the cpp could create variable length lists on the fly.  eg The problem is related the inability of the c preprocessor to count automatically.p  pAnd secondly, when I try to use anonymous structs for newer versions of GCC, so I might get rid of an extra m required to access member data in ISOC eg foo.m.mydata, by deleting the m name from the class union definition, and compile with gcc stdc11  , it then simply gave me errors claiming the struct defined nothing... so, anonymous structs inside unions dont work even in GCC 4.8 although it supposed to  how can I get anonymous structs to workp  pBelow is the example of how I tested and implemented an include file, voidbind.h, which builds a list of classes and statically links the methods to the variables of that class type.p  pUltimately, the system allows me to program like this example which I compiled with gcc 4.0 to 4.9 with no problemsp  precodeclasstest.c ifndef MACROCHECK   Dont macro expand stdio.h, its ugly... include ltstdio.hgt   to see macros, do gcc D MACROCHECK E classtest.c endif include class1.h  include example class, library.  define VOIDFINALIZE include voidbind.h  Make class list finalized, no more classes allowed  void main void       class1ct a  types ending in ct are the macro created class types     class2ct b      M a , init   Call method of variable, a, and the function init.     printfas sn,a.m.name, M b, tryme, echo is this         Id love to be rid of .m. in the previous line using anonymous struct  codepre  pNext is the Class definition  header file, for both class1 and class2, showing how the macro preprocessor is used to create classes of data bound to methods and the ct type normally this would probably be broken up into two header files, and two libraries but Im just abusing the header by putting all the code together for simplicity.p  precodeclass1.h ifndef class1h define class1h    Define the data type structure for class1 typedef struct      char name     int   one  class1t   Define the method type structure for class1  union class1ctt   class type tag, incomplete tag type for class1ct typedef struct   method prototypes     void init union class1ctt   passed a pointer to class1ct  class1mt   bind class1mt and class1t together into class1ct define VOIDNEWCLASS class1 include voidbind.h   Begin class2 definition typedef struct   define data type for class2     int x  class2t  union class2ctt   class type tag, forward definition typedef struct   method prototypes for class2     char tryme union class2ctt, char echo   class2mt   bind class2t and class2mt together into class2ct define VOIDNEWCLASS class2 include voidbind.h    Start library code  This would normally be a separate file, and linked in  but as were doing a test, this is in the header instead...  include ltclass1.hgt  void class1init class1ct self       selfgtm.name  test     selfgtm.one5      Define class1s method type mt instance of linker data ld  voidbind.h when it creates classes, expects an instance of the  method type mt named with mtld appended to link the prototyped  methods to C functions.  This is the actual binding information  and is the data that I cant get to optimize out, eg when there  is more than one method, and some of them are not used by the program  class1mt class1mtld       .initclass1init     CLASS2 libcode   char class2tryme class2ct self, char echo       return echo    class2s method type mt instance of linker data ld. class2mt class2mtld    linker information for method addresses     .trymeclass2tryme     End of library code  endif codepre  pFinally, comes voidbind.h This is the heart of the system, Getting the CPP to make a compile time constant list of void pointers to method structs ... the void list will always optimize out, as long as everything passed in are compile time constants. But the structs in the list will not completely optimize out.  even if constants. p  pFor this to idea to work, I had to figure out a way to make cpp count how many times the voidbind header file was included, in order to automatically make a list of class pointers, and since the macro preprocessor can not do addition, or define macros which change based on a previous definition of the same macro name I had to use inline functions to save the pointer to the class method struct mt from one pass to the next.  Thats what forces me to basically use void pointers, though it might be solvable in another way.p  precode voidbind.h  A way to build compile time void pointer arrays  These arrays are lists of constants that are only important at compile  time and which go away once the compilation is finished egstatic bind.  Example code written by Andrew F. Robinson of Scappoose   ifdef VOIDWASFINALIZED  error voidbindh was included twice after a VOIDFINALIZE was defined endif    VOIDFINALIZE, define only after all class headers have been included.   It will simplify the macro expansion output, and minimize the memory impact  of an optimization failure or disabling of the optimization in a bad compiler  in hopes of making the program still work.  ifdef VOIDFINALIZE  define VOIDWASFINALIZED undef VOIDBIND static inline void VOIDBIND int x       return VOIDBINDOBJ[ x ]  else   Make sure this file has data predefined for binding before being  included, or else error out so the user knows its missing a define.  if  defined VOIDNEWOBJ  ampamp  defined VOIDNEWCLASS   error missing a define of VOIDNEWOBJ or VOIDNEWCLASS endif     Initialize a macro once to count the number of times this file  has been included eg since one object is to be added to the void  list each time this file is included.

Negative 3847 pI am confused about how arrays in Javascript work in tandem with functions like math.random.

And since Math.random is selecting a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, what specific number is assigned to each variable in the var examples Like, what number would be selected that would cause 1 to be printed out or foxy to be printed out p  pDoes every variable in the array take up an equal amount of the length from greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1 Thanks for the help and sorry if this is worded badly or not in the correct format.p

I will typically use a global service locator in case like this and I believe I understand why that can be evil, and very well might be biting me here  but the main reason being that precisely for something like a simulator or often for UI purposes, I dont want to take the dependency on the simulator in the constructor since its only used in some scenarios. More below.pli lipThe environment should be initialized after creation.  Hence the use of codeOnActivatingcode here, which works well except for one caveat...pli lipThe codeIndependentClasscode takes an codeIEnvironmentcode, and I want a fully initialized codeIEnvironmentcode at this point.  In this case though, the Resolve of the codeIndependentClasscode is what triggers the resolve of codeIEnvironmentcode.  So if I use codeOnActivatedcode, then we dont have the resolve problem, but the environment isnt Initialized until after the constructor is called. pli ul  pstrongThe actual problem finallystrongp  pAs written, what currently happensp  ul licodeResolveltIndependentClassgtcode triggers..li licodeResolveltIEnvironmentgtcodeli licodeOnActivatingltEnvironmentgtcode triggers codeEnvironment.Initializecode...li liWhich then calls codeSampleComponent.Initializecode...li liWhich calls the global scope codeResolveltIEnvironmentgtcode..li liWhich then resolvesinstantiates a second codeEnvironmentcodeli ul  pSo even though I have registered codeEnvironmentcode as a singleton, two instances are created.p  pIts not a bug, it appears to be the expected behavior since the codeInitializecode call occurs in codeOnActivatingcode and the instance hasnt yet be registered, but what should I do to resolve this p  pstrongId like to requirestrongp  ul lipThat the Environment codeResolvecode occurs on a deferred basis when codeSampleComponentcode is codeResolvecoded. Since an environment isnt always needed.pli lipThat the codeEnvironment.Initializecode call is made before the instance is passed to the codeSampleComponentcode ctor. pli lipThat codeSampleComponentcode not have to take an codeISimulatorcode ctor argument since its not required usually.  But I wouldnt be opposed to restructuring the factory pattern into something more Autofac friendly, as long as I dont have to require my nontop level components to be Autofac aware.pli ul  pBasically, I just want to require that the Initialization call is made prior to the IEnvironment instance being used, and since the codeEnvironmentcodecodeSampleComponentcodecodeSimulatorcode object graph is entirely separate, that seems like something that should be able to wired upexpressed.p  pstrongThings Ive triedstrongp  ul lipExplicitly resolving the trade environment first As noted, this works, but I find the requirement a little too constraining.  Mainly because I have some optional configuration that I like to allow via a UI or whatever after the container is built but before the environment is resolved, and since an environment or simulator isnt always required, I dont want to instantiate it until its needed.  Same holds true with codeIStartablecode or codeAutoActivatecode, unless theres an alternate way to use them Im not seeing.pli lipAbandoning the service locator pattern.  In that case though, Id need to express that codeSampleComponentcode needs to resolve an codeISimulatorcode only for certain values of serviceType, and otherwise pass null to the constructor or Propertyetc.  Is there a clean way to express thatpli lipFinally, creating my own instance registration, and storing the Environment instance as a static singleton.  Something likep  pbuilder.Registerc  CreateInstance.AsSelf.As.SingleInstance.OnActivatinge  e.Instance.Initializep  pWherep  precode    private static Environment globalInstance private static Environment CreateInstance      if globalInstance  null              globalInstance  new Environment          return globalInstance  codepre  pThis works, though 1. codeOnActivatingcode is still called for every new instance.  2. Just feels way too hacky  ultimately Im now managing the instance and construction, which is what the container is for.  Its also a little more annoying when you actually want to used the container to resolve parameters, but again can be worked around easily enough.pli ul  pSo ALL that said and I do greatly appreciate you making it this far, it seems like I have a fundamental misunderstanding here. Im guessing it relates to the service locator pattern andor the haphazard factory in the codeSampleComponentcode, but Ill stop speculating.  p  pstrongI guess the real question is What am I missingstrongp

Negative 3847 pIm developing a device mapper driver and was wondering about delays dues to performing disk initialization in the constructor context. Theres a fair amount of IO to be done during some initial setup  ranges of blocks to clean out.p  pFrom looking over dm implementations it appears that this work is done synchronously in the constructor. That is the constructor shouldnt be allowed to return until this operation is done. I dont know if thats a good idea or whether theres a way to make it asynchronous until the init time work is done. p  pI was thinking that calls to map might be deferred by returning DMIOREQUEUE until the operation completes. But that may be some seconds. Ive not found any docs or reference that covers the function set of the targettype structure in dm. Just what Ive seen of some dm drivers making use of some of these function indirects. Any hints on where theres details of the methods or rules on what can and cant be done in the constructorp

Only, Im in the position that doing things the correct way is not really useful to me because the cost would be too high right now I think Im aware of the mess that might happen and Im prepared to pay the price of inconsistent git repo replicas later on. Im also aware that this is not the proper approach from a project management standpoint, the thing is that I have to keep current project time into consideration too. correct now can lead to failure.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong A sensitive information ended up in a commit message that has been pushed for ages and the repo was subsequently heavily cloned and branched. Well correct the main repo and clones later on e.g. rebasing the commit and then rebasing the subsequent developments as soon as we have time, but I have to strip the information from the Origin  right now.p  pId like to either  change or delete the commit message content without changing the id should not matter if leads to inconsistency since that commit is very old and is very, very unlikely to be rebasedcherrypickedfilterbranched. or  or strongnuke the commitstrong, reconnecting its parent as the parent of the child commit, without rewriting the id of the latter same inconsistency problem, yeah.p  por something along those lines.p  pIve stumbled on the stronggitreplacestrong manual entry but its not entirely clear to me if it requires the original commit content to persist, or if it can be nuked or hidden to subsequent clone operations.p  pthank you in advance p  pps you might wander why I didnt continue to post in the original threads thats because what Im asking is definitely noncanon and I dont want to deceive users that are not in my peculiar situation into doing very dangerous things.p  pand yes, well keep multiple backups of the original repo just in case.p
