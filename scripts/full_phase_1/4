When I hover over image 1, its beneath the other images.p  pWhen I hover over image 18, however, its above every other images. I want all of the pictures to act image 18 last picture on page 1.p  pIm guessing you have to make a div appear on top of another or something, somehow, and I have no idea how to do that.p  pCan I use CSS to do this Is it even possiblep  pHeres a linkp  pa hrefhttpbeautifiedbyelsa.sewordpressgalleri1 relnofollowhttpbeautifiedbyelsa.sewordpressgalleri1ap  pThank you in advance.p  pRegards,p

Positive 4 pIm dealing with a rare bug using Chrome 45 Windows only. When I resize the web browser, suddenly the html tag gets the width and height value on auto, then the page gets blank all html code is there, but invisible I dont get it, dont understand how or why those values are set in auto.p  pMy tests has been using IE, FireFox, Chrome also Canary, Opera on Windows Safari, Chrome 45 on Mac, Edge on Windows 10 the only browser that sets that value is Chrome 45 on Windows, the other browsers just sets the values on  pxp  pChrome seems doesnt like pages with higher 800px width values, so sets the value in auto.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p  pRodp

Positive 4 pThe code Im working with is too long to post, so Ive made a fiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netEmily925b72k225 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netEmily925b72k225ap  pThis code takes a random image and cuts it up into a number of pieces depending on the class that is applied in the div which contains the image.p  pWhen the page loads, a random image is selected from the array and the class is applied to it, what Im trying to do is create a separate div, which when clicked on will reload the div containing the image. The result Im looking for is for the image to be replaced by a new random image with the class applied to it. p  pRight now, the only way I can make a new image appear in the div is to reload the entire page, ideally this would be achieved by just having the div reload instead of all the other page elements reloading too.p  pI havent been able to do this so far but have received some help on here on how to reload an image and class on click of a div, lines 9801018 of the Javascript code in the jsfiddle is the current attempt at achieving this, but solving this problem seems much more complicated as the image is being manipulated by the Javascript code, so perhaps this needs to also be reloaded at the same time as the new randomised image is selected p  pThis is the current attempt at solving this problemp  precodefunction      var imageArray  [     httpwww.webdesignhot.comwpcontentuploads200910CatsVectorImage.jpg,     httpwww.costumeworks.comimageshalloweencatinwitchhat.jpg,     httponthewight.comwpcontent201304sootyryde.jpg]     reloadImagesimageArray     reload.onclick,function          masterdiv img[iddiv] .eachfunctionindex             this.removeClassjqPuzzle jqprindex3cindex3SCN             this.fadeOut slow, function                  ifindex0                      reloadImagesimageArray                                  this.addClassjqPuzzle jqprindex3cindex3SCN                 this.fadeIn                                function shuffleArrayarray      for var i  array.length  1 i gt 0 i          var j  Math.floorMath.random  i  1         var temp  array[i]         array[i]  array[j]         array[j]  temp          return array   function reloadImagesarray     shuffleArrayarray     forvar i0ilt3i          places the first image into all divs         document.getElementByIddivi1id.srcarray[0]       codepre  pIve written more details on the issue in the html section of the jsfiddle.

Positive 4 pI have created and Instagram clone and I am having some trouble with appending comments to individual codeltdivgtcode elements. What I would like to accomplish is to have a user type some text in the codeltinputgtcode box, click the submit button, and have said text appear under the codeltinputgtcode area via a codeltligtcode in a codeltulgtcode I created called codecommentlistcode. Similarly, I would only like said input to be targeted to each specific image imported from my JSON GET request without text duplication on any single item. The jQuery seems right to be able to append the text, but it isnt working and a fresh pair of eyes certainly wouldnt hurt.p  pHere is the jsbin a hrefhttpjsbin.comtecahaeditoutput

Positive 4 pI am trying to get a title to display over an image and have it center horizontally and vertically using displaytablecell. p  pA specific example is a hrefhttpollymoss.com relnofollowhttpollymoss.coma  how, on hover, the title of each poster comes up and is centered verticallyhorizontally. I inspected element and saw they were using Display Tablecell but I cant replicate it. p  pIf anyone happens to know a way to make this work, that would be great p  pThis is the page in question a hrefhttpsathyaram.comgraphic relnofollowhttpsathyaram.comgraphicap  pIm trying to get those titles for each tile to appear ON the tile, centered verticallyhorizontally. p  pIf theres a better method than displaytablecell, I would love to know I know you can use positionabsolutesrelatives, but I would like it to be responsive and Im not sure how thatd workp  pIm trying to do this specifically within CSS  not sure how to use jQueryp  pThank you very muchp
Positive 4 pFirst of all, lets suppose that I have the following canvas codeltcanvas idcan width400 height200 gtcode. And Then, I need to resize it with codewidth 100 height autocode to fit my responsive container. And now, lets suppose that my canvas got a width of 800. And the problem is that everytime when I try the get the positionx, y of a click event, I get the coordinates relative to the actual mouse position.p  pTo be clear, If I click the bottomedge of the canvas, Insted of getting the position400, 200, I get 800, 400.p  pAlready searched on the web for a solution but I cant find my specific problem and neither jQuery or vanilla javascript seems to have a easy approach to the problem. The only solution that I thought of was using a kind of a mathematical relation between the actual canvas dimensions setted in the DOM and the width and height of it after the scaling, but I really cant figure how.p

Negative 4 pIm guessing the StackOverflow code has something along the lines of a UsersController that defines a function like thisp  precodepublic ActionResult Profilestring id, string username, string sort       codepre  pFrom what I can tell, theres two ways to go about implementing the Profile function.  One is to use a switch statement on the sort parameter and render a different view based on what is being displayed e.g. stats, recent, responses.  These views would then render a partial user control to handle the display of the top half of the profile page gravatar, username, last seen, etc.p  pThe other way I could see implementing this would be to always render one view and have the logic for showing  hiding its different sections based on the sort.  This would lead to a pretty monstrous view page, but it should work as well.p  pAre there any other ways of implementing the StackOverflow profile page that Im missing  The reason I ask is because my current ASP.NET MVC page has a similar profile page and I want to make sure Im not going about this the wrong way.p

Negative 4 pI have a custom view in a custom table cell. Every time a specific property on the custom view is changed I call code[self setNeedsDisplay]code which redraws the view in code voiddrawRectCGRectrectcode.

But when the table view is larger than the screen and cells have to be reused, codedrawRectcode isnt called every time codesetNeedsDisplaycode is. Especially when I flick the table quickly . Slow scrolling works fine. This leads to the information in the first and last cells often being incorrect.p  pIn the log I can see that normally, for every call to codesetNeedsDisplaycode there is a call to codedrawRectcode, but when I scroll the table view quickly there are more calls to codesetNeedsDisplaycode than codedrawRectcode.

Negative 4 pI want to add a little flair to my application and while I have been somewhat successful, I havent figured out a way to truly do what I want to do. I would try to subclass UITabViewController, but I dont think I would even know where to start or if that is the right approach. p  pBasically, what I want to do is have custom images for each tab bar button. I have both pressed and nonpressed images. Instead of using the highlight that is generated over the current icon, I want the pressed image to be shown. What Ive been able to do is create a Category of the UITabBar with a custom drawRect method that basically draws all of my custom tab bar icons. I then initialize the same amount of UITabBarItems wout specifying an image or title of any kind which I then add to the array of items. This lets me have my icons and then just overlays the highlight on them. p  pThis is ok I guess, but I would really like to have the pressed button look. p  pHere is the code I use for drawing the tab barp  precodeimplementation UITabBar CustomImage   voiddrawRectCGRectrect      UIImage image  [UIImage imageNamedTabBar.png]     [image drawInRectCGRectMake0,0,320,50]   end codepre  pAnd then I initialize the tab bar items like thisp  precodeUITabBarItem homeTabBarItem  [[UITabBarItem alloc] init] codepre  pIf anyone knows how I would do this, that would be greatly appreciated. Please keep in mind that Im still relatively new to ObjectiveC, so Im somewhat confused as to how I would correctly subclass anything at this point. p  pThe functionality Im looking for would be similar to what RougeSheep was able to accomplish with Postage a hrefhttppostage.roguesheep.com relnofollowhttppostage.roguesheep.coma They did an awesome job, and this is kind of what Id like to emulate. p

Negative 4 pAs one who is relatively new to the whole support and bug fixing environment and a young programmer I had never come across a bug that only occurs in the Websphere environment but not on the localhost test enviroment, until today.

I decided to try on the Websphere test environment to see what would happen and I successfully reproduced the bug.  The problem is I cant make changes and build to the Websphere test enviroment.

Or are there even any methodologies at all  Any advice or help on how to approach issues like thisp

Negative 4 pI am currently working on a project where some significant data corruption has occurred.  Specifically the database is using GUIDs as primary keys on most tables, however it is not enforcing data integrity between those tables due to a longwinded this was bought from another company and integrated with our stuff discussion.  There is an effort underway to introduce referential integrity, however the data has to be cleaned up before that is possible.p  pPart of this data corruption is that different entity keys have been switched or inserted into incorrect columns.  For example a valid ProductId value exists in a CustomerId field due to the software inserting the wrong key in the wrong column.  This was happening for months in the database before the issue was finally caught during a data aggregation job and now the cleanup effort is rather large.p  pWhat Im wondering is if there is a way of finding a GUID in a database.  Rather, if I have a GUID that I think is a primary key in some table, is there a way in TSQL of asking for matches to any known uniqueidentifier key columnp  pI know the GUID I have isnt a CustomerId, but it might be another primary key id from some other table.  Up to now the team have been searching the other tables manually for matches to the rogue GUIDs to see if they can find out the type of the key.  Theyve even gone as far as to create scripts with lots of select  from [table] where [tableId]  rogueGUID statements that search the known entity tables for a match.  However, this approach isnt very efficient.p  pIm looking for this script not only for this project but also because I think a Does this GUID exist as a primary key value anywhere in this database type of query would be a useful asset in a development toolbox.  Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 4 pFirst post so please be gentle p  pWhen creating user controls in ASP.NET MVC, what is the best way to structure the code so that the controllers that invoke views that use the user controls do not all have to know so much about the controls I would like to know a good way to maintain DRY while using user controls in ASP.NET MVC.p  pPlease note, this question only pertain to user controls that require special handling and logic on a postback. I have no problem creating nice DRY code for user controls that are either view only using RenderPartial or that require some preprocessing to create the appropriate ViewModel using RenderAction.p  pAlso, this question pertains only to achieving reusable controls within an application. I am not worried about reusability between applications at this point.p  pTo give a specific example, lets say I would like to create a Quick Add user control which contains three entry fields, First Name, Last Name and Company Name and a submit button. When the QuickAdd functionality is used, the following steps should be performed independent of what page the control is onp  ol liValidate that the fields were not empty, if they are, show an indicator.li liPerform a lookup to a repository to see if the Company already exists, if not create it.li liCreate a new contact associated to either the existing company or the newly created companyli liRerender the existing page. If no validation errors, the user would see the exact same page again, otherwise the same page with validation errors.li ol  pMy main problem with achieving DRY has to do with all the controllers that invoke views that contain the partial view end up having to have an Action Method to process the form submission from the Quick Add. Even if I break out the logic for processing the information into a separate controller and invoke that method from each of the other controllers it seems like a burden that each and every controller that invoke views that have reusable controls have to have that knowledge.p  pThe other option I looked at was to have the reusable control always submit to a specific action method  controller but then there is no way for that controller to know how to repopulate the model appropriately for the specific controller that invoked the view that contained the reusable control in step 4.p  pI am aware that there is talk of subcontrollers in MVC 2 from this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1244911aspnetmvccontainedusercontrolshttpstackoverflow.comquestions1244911aspnetmvccontainedusercontrolsa but since it is not there yet, what is the best way to structure the code to achieve maximum reusability while maintaining DRY p  pIs there an alternative to having to have all the controllers that invoke views that use a reusable control with the characteristics of the one described above,  having to have an Action Method to process the information from the controlp

I just get no specular reflections or they are so weak andor are at the wrong place andor have the wrong color.p  pFrom the numerous wrong implementations I post some little code that already seems to be wrong.

And if you imagine changing the vector V in the picture the angle is the same when the viewing vector is on the left side. and becomes more and more different when going to the right.p  pI pesonally would multiply the whole projection by two to become something similiar and the hole point is to avoid the calculation of R. Altough I didnt read anythinga bout that anywehre i am gonna try this out...p  pResult The intension of the specular light is far too  much white areas and the position is still wrong.p  pI think I am messing something else up because teh reflection are just at the wrong place. But whatp  pEdit Now I read on wikipedia in the notes that the angle of NH is in fact approximalty half or VR. To compensate that i should multiply my shineness exponent by 4 rather than my projection. If i do that I end up with no visible specular light.p

But we are only allowed to use tomcat to develop. Thus we do not know what would happen in the production server, this make us very sad. Of course, our company cannot afford to make another websphere for development usage.  p  pWhat can I dop
Negative 4 pI am using Android with ORMLite in a small app I am currently writing.  The app aims to have a working ImportExport function, for which I use Simple XML framework.  And everything works great, up to a point.p  pThe situation is as follows Object A contains a foreign key referencing Object B, which references Object C through a foreign key itself.  Exporting a database is great.  Importing works to, with a small caveat, namely that it works as long as the IDs of all object are sequential and start from 1.  But if the database is fragmented, i.e. I deleted a record here and there, after I export the database, I have holes in the generated XML structure. Example objects could bep  precodeDatabaseTableorders public class Order      DatabaseFieldgeneratedId  true     private int id     DatabaseFieldcolumnNamedate     private Date date     DatabaseFieldcolumnNamecost     private double cost     DatabaseFieldforeign  true, columnNamecustomerid     private Customer customer      ... more fields, getters and setters   DatabaseTablecustomers public class Customer      DatabaseFieldgeneratedId  true     private int id     DatabaseField     private String name      ... more fields, getters and setters  codepre  pLets say I have a database with 2 customers id 1 and 2, which hold respectively orders from 1 through 5 and 6 through 8.  Exporting this and then reimporting in a clean database works great. If however I delete customer 1 and their orders and export it, the exporter will write their id as they are, i.e. p  precodeltcustomer id2gt...ltcustomergt codepre  pand p  precodeltorder id6gt...ltordergt ltorder id7gt...ltordergt ltorder id8gt...ltordergt ltorder id9gt...ltordergt codepre  petc.  When I import the data into a fresh database, I would first save the customer object viap  precodecustDao.createCustomerx codepre  pand then each of their orders viap  precodeorderDao.createOrdero codepre  pThe problem is that the create function disregards the provided id which is not 0 and the newly generated id for customer is 1 in a fresh, empty database. Same for the orders.  But since they reference customer with id2, the link between them is broken.p  pSo after this somewhat longwinded explanation, here is my question Is there a way to tell ORMLite to take the provided value for a generatedId field and run with it, instead of overwriting it I would be OK, if any Exception is generated in case the create function finds row already in the table with the same ID, but would proceed with saving the record otherwise... I have thought of a workaround for this all the objects should be sortable by ID using the Comparator interface sort the ArrayList with objects to be imported for each object  read supposed id into an int,  save to database using dao.create,  if the objects new id is different than supposed id, change it via dao.updateId,  move to the next object in the list...  But that seems too cumbersome and errorprone What if the create method tries to generate an id, which you just reassigned to a previous object with updateIdp  pI dont believe my situation is so rare, that no one has encountered this before.  I would appreciate a solutionp  pBest regards, Todorp

Negative 4 pI was going to create an ArrayList of GPS coordinates that are saved in a custom object. I then want to display a list of these GPS coordinates. My current solution is to create a parallel ArrayList of strings that essentially are the GPS.toString results. p  pThis seems like a complicated bit of extra work that might be able to be avoided and simplified. Can anybody think of a better way to do this that doesnt require an awkwardly large amount of work. I looked a little into creating a custom ArrayAdapter but Im not sure I fully understand how to convert the GPS coordinate object into something useful for the ListView. If you think this is a better solution, could you perhaps give a little insight into how to use this properly even if its just a linkp  pThanks in advance Matt p

Negative 4 pIm fairly new to android and have only really been using eclipse for some basic Blackberry work so I was curious if I could pick a few experts minds for any suggestionspointers on the workspaceproject setup you use for dual platform support projects in eclipsep  pIve found about 80 of my code is common between Blackberry and Android so its this 20 Im needing to address.p  pMy current thinking is to have one workspace with shared source in multiple projects via setting them in the source tree options.p  pWhere platform specific features are used Ill tag the source name as Android and Blackberry respectively and have a generic class that both projects point to.  p  pI.e. effectively one workspace holds both Android and Blackberry setups and in the workspace have one project for Blackberry and one for Android but each project shares the same filesystem with the appropritate other platforms source files excluded from the build.p  pIf only there was an easy way of doing the codeifdefcode equivalent in java this would simplify this port but I guess we have to do it without.I heard about using a c preprocessor to do this but sounds messy so unless its highly recommended Id rather not adopt thisp  pId heard about creating a shared library but have a feeling these are not compatible between android and blackberry so any advice on this approach is also welcome.p

Negative 4 pI have cloned an SVN repository from work using gitsvn. During the initial cloning, I provided an SVN authors file.

Negative 4 pNot sure whether this is possible, but Im creating a file encoding applcation. When a file is decoded, it is saved temporarily in a temp directory, after which it can be opened regularly. However, I actually need to be certain the file is removed as soon as the application that has opened it, has closed it e.g. has shut down. Otherwise, the decoded secret file is just hanging in the temp directory without supervision.p  pWhats more, even when my application itself has been shut down for any reason, Id like to pass this task on to Windows, if possible. So say the user decodes a file and opens it and then my application is shut down either normally or abnormally, the decoded file in the temp directory should still be removed as soon as its not used anymore.p  pHow would I go about this Ive seen tips like codeFileSystemWatchercode and a trivial check every second idea, but if my application is not alive at the moment the decoded file is closed, Id still like to have the file removed. So I guess Id need to pass this responbility to Windows, but Im not sure if thats possible and if so, how.p  pSo how do I remove a file as soon as its closed if my application isnt running at that particular momentp

Negative 4 pSo I have a dictionary with keyvaluetuple. Something like this. name4,5,.... where 4,5 represents two categories cat1, cat2. Given a maximum number for the second category, I would like to find the optimal combination of dictionary entries such that the 1st category is maximized or minimized.p  pFor example, if maxCat2  15, I want to find some combination of entries from the dictionary such that, when I add the cat2 values from each entry together, Im under 15. There may be many such conditions. Of these possibilities, I would like to pick the one that when I add up the values for cat1 for each entry it is larger than any of the other possibilities.p  pI thought about writing an algorithm to get all permutations of the entries in the dictionary and then see if each one meets the maxCat2 criteria and then see which one of those gives me the largest total cat1 value. If I have 20 entries, that means I would check 20 combinations, which is a very large number. Is there anything that I can do to avoid this Thanks. p

Negative 4 pI am working on a project that requires that I render XML data that would be my model.  Its basically going to be represented in a row  column format similar to your standard database representation.  Except you should be able to click on a row and from there perform some basic data entry.  I initially thought about using Json data and Jgrid to do this, but It seems like it may be more trouble than it is worth.  From conversations with my coworkers, it seems as though it is possible to send xml from a controller straight to the view.  Since XML is just a string, I guess that wouldnt be to hard.  I am just a little unsure about how to get this done.  So I guess I mentioned all that to ask, how can you render XML data in a view that you get from a controller.  What is best practice in a situation like this  What is the best way to send XML over from a controller to a view  What is the best way to render this view  Is there a way that I can make a row of that xml data clickable  Should I just byte the bullet and try and figure out jqGridp  pThanks, Derekp

Negative 4 pI am a bit perplexed on what Android holds onto in a view orientation change and what it doesnt.p  pSome things it seems it holds onto nicely, other things it seems it doesnt.. So I am not sure if it is my code, or something else.  I assume I am doing something stupidp  pWhat I have is a view with a listview in it, the listview has a simple adapater and an array of map items to put into the listview.p  pWhen the orientation changes, I know that the activity is destroyed and recreated, so I assume that my simple adapater and its tie to the listview are gone.. so the listview wont rotate populated and Ill need to use the onRetainNonConfigurationInstance or onSaveInstanceState methods to pass through either the adapter or the list of valuesp  pThis seems excessive, I cant believe the sharp guys at Google dont have an easier way to handle this.. The listview has an ID, and after orientation I can add items to it and it works fine, but it just doesnt hold onto the values it had before.p  pIs my only way around this to pass the list content through explicitely  Is it the fact I am creating a new SimpleAdapter and linking it to the list in the onCreate that is causing the issue  Or is it the fact the array of Items I have linked to the adapter is whiped out when the activity is  This seems like something that shouldnt require this much work to accomplish.. am I missing somethingp

Negative 4 pI would like my comboboxes to have the first value be empty so that the user can clear their previous selection. The comboboxes are bound to entities in the ViewModel. So how do I add this first value. I could used codecombobox.inert0, new Entitycode, but is that the correct wayp  pThis is for searching purposes By default the combobox has no selection and the search will find everything. If they select an item the search is filtered.p

Negative 4 pI am trying to wrap my head around items that will be displayed in a drop down control of a web application and these items are value objects in my model. As an example, lets assume I an entity named RFI request for Information. That RFI has a value object named State. The possible state values as prescribed by the business are Created, Open, Suspended, Closed. These values need to be displayed to the user and are updatable by the user In some admin console. Since the values are only persisted on the entity, itself, what is the best method to store the list of possible values p  pI am using a database SQL 2008 and an ORM framework Entity Framework 4.1, however I am not sure the database is the best place to store the possible values. I have heard of some users creating resource files XML documents, CSV files, etc for such things. What are others in the community doing in a scenario like this and what are some recommended best practices.p
Negative 4 pThe normal pattern for avoiding the CA2000 warning about nondisposed locals is to use a temp variable that gets disposed if anything goes wrong, likep  precodeFoo f  null try      f  new Foo     Foo result  f     f  null     return result  finally      if f  null              f.Dispose       codepre  pA bit verbose, but it works, and it makes sense. But how does one apply that pattern to chained constructors, like thisp  precodepublic HomeController  IDataRepository db       this.repo  db  new SqlDataRepository   public HomeController        thisnew SqlDataRepository   codepre  pThis code is throwing up two CA2000 warnings, one per constructor. The first one I can get rid of using the temp variable pattern. Its pretty annoying, since there doesnt see to be any way for the local to go out of scope after its constructed but before it gets assigned to the member field, which gets cleaned up later. So I dunno what CAs problem is, but at least I know what to do to fix it.p  pBut, as far as I can figure out, there isnt any alternative way to write the second constructor call to introduce a tryfinally. The field being assigned to is readonly, so it strongmuststrong be set in a constructor. And C wont let you call chained constructors anywhere but immediately before the constructor body. And, of the two, the second warning is actually the more legitimate one  the call to the chained constructor could in theory, if it did any actual work throw an exception and leave the newly constructed parameter undisposed.p  pOf course, I can always just suppress this message which CA2000 seems to need a lot of, but if theres an actual way to eliminate the problem Id prefer to do that.p

Negative 4 pI am looking for a way to have a query that returns a tuple first sorted by a column, then grouped by another in that order. Simply code.sortby.groupbycode didnt appear to work. Now I tried the following, which made the return value go wrong I just got the orm object, not the initial tuple, but read for yourself in detailp  pstrongBase scenariostrongp  pThere is a query which queries for test orm objects linked from the codetest3code table through foreign keys. This query also returns a column named codelinkedcode that either contains codetruecode or codefalsecode. It is originally ungrouped.p  precodemyquery  session.querytestormobject ... lots of stuff like joining various things ... addcolumn..condition that either puts true or false into the column.. codepre  pSo the original return value is a tuple the orm object, and additionally the truefalse column.p  pNow this query should be grouped for the test orm objects so the codetest.idcode column, but before that, sorted by the linked column so entries with codetruecode are preferred during the grouping.p  pAssuming the current unsorted, ungrouped query is stored in myquery, my approach to achieve this was thisp  precode Get a sorted subquery tmpquery  myquery.orderbydesclinked.subquery     Read the column out of the sub query     myquery  session.querytmpquery.addcolumnsgetattrtmpquery.c,linked.labellinked   myquery  myquery.groupbygetattrtmpquery.c, id  Group objects codepre  pThe resulting SQL query when running this is it looks fine to me btw  the subquery codeanon1code is inside itself properly sorted, then fetched and its id aswell as the codelinkedcode column is extracted amongst a few other columns SQLAlchemy wants to have apparently, and the result is properly groupedp  precodeSELECT anon1.id AS anon1id, anon1.name AS anon1name, anon1.fktest3 AS anon1fktest3, anon1.linked AS anon1linked, anon1.linked AS linked  FROM     SELECT test.id AS id, test.name AS name, test.fktest3 AS fktest3, CASE WHEN anon2.id  87799534 THEN true ELSE false END AS linked     FROM test LEFT OUTER JOIN SELECT test3.id AS id, test3.fktestvalue AS fktestvalue     FROM test3    AS anon2 ON anon2.fktestvalue  test.id ORDER BY linked DESC  AS anon1 GROUP BY anon1.id codepre  pI tested it in phpmyadmin, where it gave me, as expected, the id column for the orm object id, then the additional columns SQLAlchemy seems to want there, and the linked column. So far, so good.p  pNow my expected return values would be, as they were from the original unsorted, ungrouped queryp  precodeA tuple test orm object anon1.id column, truefalse value linked column codepre  pThe actual return value of the new sortedgrouped query is however the original query DOES indeed return a touple before the code above is applied   test orm object onlyp  pWhy is that so and how can I fix itp  pExcuse me if that approach turns out to be somewhat flawed. What I actually want is, have the original query simply sorted, then grouped without touching the return values. As you can see above, my attempt was to restore the additional return value again, but that didnt work. What should I do instead, if this approach is fundamentally wrongp  pstrongExplanation for the subquery usestrongp  pThe point of the whole subquery is to force SQLAlchemy to execute this query separately as a first step.p  pI want to order the results first, and then group the emorderedem results. That seems to be hard to do properly in one step when trying manually with SQL I had issues combining order and group by in one step as I wanted.p  pTherefore I dont simply order, group, but I order first, then subquery it to enforce that the order step is actually completed first, and then I group it.p  pJudging from manual PHPMyAdmin tests with the generated SQL, this seems to work fine. The actual problem is that the original query which is now wrapped as the subquery you were confused about had an added column, and now by wrapping it up as a subquery, that column is gone from the overall result. And my attempt to readd it to the outer wrapping failed.p

Negative 4 pTree Panel and Store Memory Managementp  pHi, Im new to Ext Js and cant find an answer to my problem. I have a TreePanel and a menu with some filters.

Negative 4 pI want to implement something like a WCF OData provider but using NetTcpBinding instead of WebHttpBinding  REST. I want the client to be able to write linq queries that are transparently serialized and sent to the server or potentially, multiple servers, to consolidate distributed database instances. p  pOne way to do this is to implement a custom IQueryable provider. You could pass the query expression over the wire in at least two waysp  p1 Serialize the expression to xml, send it, and deserialize it on the serverp  p2 Pass what is moreorless the precursor to raw SQL to the server in the form of DataContractsp  p1 is difficult and simply alot of work, and 2 obviously could pose security risks sql injection.

Negative 4 pI am trying to use some base Abstract classes for a Transaction, Order and an OrderCollection.

Negative 4 pI have this application Windows form application written in Visual C from a colleague of mine and I face some serious problems. The application is neither a service neither a normal application, I mean it has a GUI but most of the time it runs in background it should react as a service but its not. This application is preventing the user to log off, and I need to be able to do that.p  pI know that Windows sends the codeWMQUERYENDSESSIONcode message to all running applications when the user tries to log off. I have tried to catch this message on my codeWndProccode function and to kill the application by force but it only works once. When I login again and try to log off the operation is not terminated because my application wont close.p  pIf I try to use codeSessionEndingcode event, the application is only put to the system tray and remains there without logging off but this I believe its because the codeFormClosingcode method performs this operation instead of closing the program this was the requirement and I cant change that.p  pMaybe another useful information is that the application starts automatically because it has an entry in the codeHKLMcode registry and there are always 2 instances of this application running one should supervise the other one and restart it in case of crash but not in case of manually shut down.p  pAny suggestions will be well received.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4 pIn my PyQt4 program, I retrieve a QColor from the User via QColorDialog.br I then need to format this QColor to be used in a Style Sheet, which I currently achieve by calling...p  precodeQColor.name codepre  p... which returns something like 00ff00 which would then undergo simple string manipulation to be set as a style sheet for a widget. eg p  precodeQWidget.setStyleSheet   backgroundcolor  QColor.name    codepre  pLater in the program, the background color of the widget must be fetched using .styleSheet and more simple string manipulation and converted to a string which when evaled, would construct a QColor of the identical color.p  pIt must be converted to a QColor, since it is later used in a QBrush. The QColor must be converted to a strongone line stringstrong because it is written to file, and imported from said file via eval.br  The string when evaled strongmust pass the color to the QColor constructorstrong, since the string is only one line.p  pIn the end, I need something similiar though not possible in this manner like this  p  precodeColorString  str QtGui.QColorDialog.getColor.name  EvalString  QtGui.QColor  ColorString  codepre  pOfcourse, this method doesnt work because the QColor constructor does not accept such a format as 00ff00 which is the format that QColorDialog.name gives and which a QWidget.setStyleSheet accepts.p  pHow can I actually achieve thisp  pIs there anyway to convert a string like 00ff00 to 3 integers representing Red, Green and Blue which could then be sent to the QColor constructorbr Thanksp  pNotebr I realise that such a format 00ff00 does involve a representation of those three colours, but I dont understand what ff means, and calling .red on a QColor does not return the integer that is suggested by the 00ff00 format.br Its probably obvious that I dont understand colors p  pSpecsbr  PyQt4br  Python 2.7br  Windows 7p

Negative 4 pIm trying to write an Android app that will allow a user to search for a generic destination e.g., gas station and be presented with up to 5 nearby locations to choose from. The screen results would display the user location in the center, and possible destination options would be indicated by markers. p  pThe trick is that I dont want to rescale the map from its starting scale, and so some of the possible destinations may not be visible on the screen. I want to dynamically draw a clickable direction indicator such as an arrow that emanates from the user location and points to any offscreen destination. If there are multiple offscreen destinations, Id probably want to scale the arrow lengths to indicate relative distances. If the user clicks on the arrow, they should be teleported to the offscreen location. p  pAny thoughts on how to best implement this The only information Ive found on overlays uses static files Most overlays seem to be just .PNG files for markers one example had a route that was drawn from an XML file. Id need to calculate the arrow based on direction  to the destination direction the arrow points and the relative distance to that location arrow length, so the overlay is something Id have to come up with at run time. p  pI think the main challenge is drawing the clickable arrows, but another question that comes to mind is, should I search using the Google Maps API, or is this job more suited to the Google Places API p  pThanksp

Negative 4 pI have a software architecture problem. I have to design an IOS application wich will communicate with a Linux application to get the state of a sensor, and to publish an actuator command. The two applications run in a Local network with an AdHoc WiFi connection between the IOS device and the Linux computer. p So I have to synchronize two values between two applications as described in figure 1. In a LinuxLinux system, I resolve this kine of problem thanks to any publisher  suscriber midleware. strongBut how can I solve this problem in an IOS  Linux worldstrong p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdAiL6.png altFigure 1  my synchronization problemp  pActually the Linux application embed an asynchronous TCP Server, and the IOS application is an asynchronous TCP client. Both applications communicate through the TCP Socket. I think that this method is a low level method, and I would like to migrate the communication layer to a much higher level Service based communication framework.p  pAfter some bibliographic reaserch I found three ways to resolve my problem p  ol liThe REST Way  p I can create a RESTful Web Service wich modelize the sensor state, and which is able to send command to the actuator. An implementation of a RESTful web service client exists for IOS, that is RESTKit, and I think I can use ApacheAxis2 on the server side.li liThe RPC Way p I can create on my Linux computer a RPC service provider thanks to the libmaia. On the IOS side, I can use xmlrpc httpsgithub.comeczarnyxmlrpc. My two programs will communicate thanks to the service described in the figure bellow.li liThe ZeroConf way p I didnt get into detail of this methods, but I suppose I can use Bonjour on the IOS side, and AVAHI on the linux side. And then create custom service like in RPC on both side. pli ol  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoquKc.png altThe RPC Solution pp  pstrongDiscussion about these methods strongp  pThe REST way doesnt seem to be the good way because  emThe REST interface is designed to be efficient for largegrain hypermedia data transferem from the Chapter 5 of the Fielding dissertation. My data are very fined grain data, because my command is just a float, and my sensor state too.p  pI think there is no big difference between the ZeroConf way and the RPC Way. ZeroConf provide only the service discovering mechanism, and I dont need this kine of mechanism because my application is a rigid application. Both sides knows wich services exists.p  pSo my question are p  ul listrongDoes XML RPC based method are the good choice to solve my problem of variable synchronisation between an Iphone and a Computer strongli listrongDoes it exist other methods strongli ul  pCheers,p

This worked well, but Ive decided that presenting the data through a ContentProvider would make the project easier to maintain and expand.p  pThis means I need to provide the data as a Cursor object when requested via the query method.p  pSo far Ive been unable to update the data in the Cursor after retuning it. Does this mean that all of the data needs to be collected before returning the Cursor The Android a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcessamplesSupport4Demossrccomexampleandroidsupportv4appLoaderThrottleSupport.html relnofollowLoaderThrottleSupporta sample suggests that I dont, but I have yet to get it working for anything other than an SQL backend.p  pHas anyone else tried to present nonSQL backed asynchronous data in this sort of wayp

Negative 4 pI have a dynamic select that needs to be driven off another select, but I cannot seem to get it working in IE using IE9. Ive seen this post here but unless Im not understanding it this didnt seem to help a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8004365dynamicrelatedselectswithjquerynotworkinieDynamic Related Selects with jQuery, not work in IEa. p  pIve really simplified it so that its easy to understand the problem. I have 2 selects, and 1 drives the other. So, when you select something in the first one, the second one changes. For this example Im just adding a new item to the select and even this doesnt work in IEp  precodevar mydiv  testdiv ltselect idf1gt.appendTomydiv ltselect idf2gt.appendTomydiv f1.appendltoption value1gt1ltoptiongt f1.appendltoption value2gt2ltoptiongt f2.appendltoptiongt.attrvalue, n f1.changefunction       f2.appendltoption valuet1gtt1ltoptiongt   ltdiv idtestdivgtltdivgt codepre  pSo, in theory we should start with 2 select lists and f2 will 1 blank option in it. p  pNext, select an item from f1 and it will add a new option to f2.p  pThis works exactly as I want in firefox and chrome. In IE it just behaves oddly. Take this example in IEp  pScenario 1p  ol liI open the page and check the f2 select. It has 1 blank valueli liI select an item in f1li liI check f2 and it still has 1 blank valueli ol  pScenario 2p  ol liI open the page and dont touch the f2 select.li liI select an item in f1li liI check f2 and it has 2 itemsli liI select another item in f1li liI check f2 and it still has 2 itemsli ol  pSo it looks like the first time I activate the select control it must do something with the existing HTML... and now thats all its going to render from here on...p  pThis is driving me nuts, what am I doing wrongp  pNote Not sure if it matters, but both of the selects are dynamically generated using javascriptjquery because I dont know their values until an async call completes. p  pemstrongUpdated question due to investigation through comments... Seems my last note on the dynamic creation of the objects was crucial to recreating the problememstrongp

Negative 4 pI have a dataset. Each element of this set consists of numerical and categorical variables. Categorical variables are nominal and ordinal.  There is some natural structure in this dataset. Commonly, experts clusterize datasets such as mine using their expert knowledge, but I want to automate this process of clusterization.p  pMost algorithms for clusterization use distance Euclidean, Mahalanobdis and so on between objects to group them in clusters. But strongit is hard to find some reasonable metrics for mixed data typesstrong, i.e. we cant find a distance between glass and steel. So I came to the conclusion that I have to use strongconditional probabilitiesstrong codePfeature  something  Classcode and some utility function that depends on them. It is reasonable for categorical variables, and it works fine with numeric variables assuming they are distributed normally.p  pSo it became clear to me that algorithms like strongKmeansstrong will not produce good results. p  pAt this time I try to work with strongCOBWEBstrong algorithm, that fully matches my ideas of using conditional probabilities. But I faced another obsacles strongresults of clusterization are really hard to interpretstrong, if not impossible. As a result I wanted to get something like a set of rules that describes each cluster e.g. codeif feature1  a and feature2 in [30, 60], it is cluster1code, like descision trees for classification.p  pstrongSo, my question isstrong p  pIs there any existing clusterization algorithm that works with mixed data type and produces an understandable and reasonable for humans description of clusters.p  pstrongAdditional infostrongp  pAs I understand my task is in the field of conceptual clustering. I cant define a similarity function as it was suggested it as an ultimate goal of the whoal project, because of the field of study  it is very complicated and mercyless in terms of formalization. As far as I understand the most reasonable approach is the one used in COBWEB, but Im not sure how to adapt it, so I can get an undestandable description of clusters.p  pstrongDecision Treestrongp  pAs it was suggested, I tried to train a decision tree on the clustering output, thus getting a description of clusters as a set of rules. But unfortunately interpretation of this rules is almost as hard as with the raw clustering output. First of only a few first levels of rules from the root node do make any sense closer to the leaf  less sense we have. Secondly, these rules doesnt match any expert knowledge.p  pSo, I came to the conclusion that clustering is a blackbox, and it worth not trying to interpret its results.p  pstrongAlsostrongp  pI had an interesting idea to modify a decision tree for regression algorithm in a certain way istead of calculating an intragroup variance calcualte a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCategoryutility relnofollowcategory utility functiona and use it as a strongsplit criterionstrong. As a result we should have a decision tree with leafsclusters and clusters description out of the box. But I havent tried to do so, and I am not sure about accuracy and everything else.p

Negative 4 pI am building a web application in PHP. Users will access with their accounts.

Even with URL of picture.li ol  pI dont know if Facebook does anything like point 1. Because business is important, and also privacy of users.p  pMy first idea was making all resource accesses through a PHP file.

I am planning to add one more web application, and create a shared resource area to put shared resource into. I will need same privilege system there as well.p

Till I read I failed horribly for using a Hardcoded IV in the RijndaelManaged class.p  pIm reading everywhere that Its betterand safer to have each encrypted files IV be uniquely generated at Encryption time and saved at the frontbeginning of the File where as the rest of encrypted bytes are saved directly after this. If I understand this correctlyp  pIve been having a real hard time figuring out my problem, because each time I Encrypt a file, I write the IV to the first 16 bytesAs the class, MSDN, Google and some folk on this forum suggested of the file and directly after that I write the rest of the Encrypted bytes to the filestream. The IV is saved in plaintext..Or well unencrypted bytes lt Also is this okeyp  pemMy problem is when I try to decrypt the file using precisely the same Key it fails Before I start reading chunks of the file for decryptionBuffering I try to read the Files first 16bytes for the plaintexted IV and use it in the RijndaelManaged Class instance.emp  pThis seems to fail.

The resulting logs arep  ul licodeinputvars.logcode  5 megabytes, 90,000 linesli licodephpinput.logcode   20 megabytes, 283,000 linesli ul  pNow the error message suddenly seems legit. The codephpinput.logcode just contains bytecode, but the codeinputvars.logcode is formatted as suchp  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeArray      [filename] gt 001810100167.dwg     [versionId] gt 11253     [filetype] gt dwg     [8FjsghJJWhvPV] gt ...     ....  codepre  pThe first three keys are sent via GET, and all the rest would then be the file data. If I search and count for matches of codegtcode, I get 25,954 matches. I then assume that codeREQUESTcode holds 26,000 keys.p  pNow, over to my question I have rased the codemaxinputvarscode value several times, and it now holds the value of code30000code. Should I just ignore this security setting, and set it has high as possible My concern is that PHP removes parts from the REQUEST array if it is larger than code30000code, making the file corrupt.p  pIs there any security problems with setting this value too high Is there perhaps a better way of uploading files to PHPp

Negative 4 pI often have to copy data from our production environment to our testing environment.  They are in completely different environments where prod is behind a firewall that I have to VPN into so I cannot use linked servers.   Submitting a work order to have the DBAs do this task often takes too long so Im trying to find a systematic way to do this.br Creating a set of insert scripts based off of a select query seems to be the best and will do the trick.  The reason this will work is that these are often one time copy scripts that are staticlookup tables that arent too big.br For example if I had a table called Cars and it had a CarId and Description column, then a script would bep  precodeselect insert into Cars CarId, [Description] values   castCarId as varchar  ,   [Description]   from Cars order by CarId codepre  pIn my test database, I can simply blow out the table before I run the above insert scripts.br My prod sql user also has select access to all of the codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode tables, so Im wondering if anyone has come across a systematic way to write the above query.  Often times, the tables I need to copy have a lot of columns and the casting is different for datetime, varchar, etc...p  pEDIT Oh, and I forgot to add that my prod user does not have permissions to execute stored procs or functionsp

More information at the end of post.strongp  pI built a WCF service that uses a membership provide to provide authorization for my client and to manage usersroles etc. So far the authorization works great. p  pI am trying to give my client the ability to register new users, so I have decided to interface the sql membership provider code from within my service and then call those methods from the client, since I havent seen a way to directly call upon the SQL provider from a client without Client Application Services.p  pI tried interfacing the CreateUser method in the service and when I call it from the client to create a new user I get this error and cant figure out what is going wrongp  pemObject reference not set to an instance of an object.emp  pHere is the code from my service that calls the membership provider directly.p  precodepublic string RegisterUserstring username, string password, string email,                                                    string passwordquestion, string passwordanswer, bool isapproved                      MembershipCreateStatus status             SqlMembershipProvider mProvider  new SqlMembershipProvider             mProvider.CreateUserusername, password, email, passwordquestion, passwordanswer, true, null, out status              switch status                              case MembershipCreateStatus.DuplicateUserName                     return Username already exists.

Negative 4 pI have several 1000s of images on disk that I need to display a subset of, given user search criteria.  What this means is I could be showing 100s at one time.  Each image is large 3510x1131 to be exact.  And I need to do some light image processing before they are displayed adjusting brightness and contrast.p  pMy application to do this is a Web.API app using jQuery.p  pMy first pass was to just pass the URLs to the browser and then size the images and make those adjustments using pixastic.  Works, but its pretty slow.p  pI was thinking it would be much faster if I could resize the image before doing the adjustments, but I dont want to create copies and then link to those.  Maybe there is a way to generate the images on the fly and serve them up  Via REST perhaps  Bottom line is I need a LOSSY image resize, not just setting width and height using css.p  pAre there tools out there that I am missing or has anyone done something similar  I think what Im looking for is exactly like google image search results but I dont know how they generate those thumbnails and if I were to adjust brightnesscontrast am I doing it on the thumbail saving time or the full size imagep
Negative 4 pi have an issue with a DropDownChoice the DDC component. The situation is as following I want to create a simple registry page for a contest. So i need a team with participants. I have created a form which is a composition of different panelsforms on which you can enter the name, age and position in the game. Then you press the add participant button and the participant should appear in the DropDownChoice. p  pI am new to Apache Wicket and actually i am glad i get the form to show on the screen and to see that the participants are actually added to the DDC. But here comes the issue All of the participants in the DDC are turned into the last one added. In other words suppose i create the participant Jeff. Jeff gets added to the DDC, no problem. Then i create Mike. When i add Mike to the DDC and look at the available participants, Jeff seems to have been turned into Mike. So at this point, i do have 2 participants in my team, but the first one,Jeff, i suddenly Mike as well. And it is not only the property which is displayed that has changed. It is the complete content of the Participant object that turns into Mike. p  pNow if i would like to add Janine, Jeff and Mike would both turn into Janine and i would have 3 Janine participants in my DDC. I ll add the code of the TeamForm, which i believe is the most relevant.

Negative 4 pIm trying my best to adhere to some strict design patterns while developing my current code base, as I am hoping I will be working on it for quite a while to come and I want it to be as flexible and clean as possible. However, in trying to combine all these design patterns to solve the current problem I am facing, I am running into some issues Im hoping someone can advise me a bit on.p  pIm working on some basic homebrewn GUI widgets that are to provide some generic clickdragduplication behavior. On the surface, the user clicks the widget, then drags it somewhere. Having dragged it far enough, the widget will appear to clone itself and leave the user dragging this new copy.p  pThe Prototype design pattern obviously enters the foray to make this duplication functionality generalizable for many types of widgets. For most objects, the story ends there. The Prototype object is virtually an identical copy of the duplicated version the user ends up dragging.p  pHowever, one of the objects I want to duplicate has some fairly big resources attached to it, so I dont want to load them until the user actually decides to click and drag, and subsequently duplicate, that particular object. Enter Lazy initialization. But this presents me with a bit of a conundrum. I cannot just let the prototype object clone itself, as it would need to have the big resources loaded before the user duplicates the dummy prototype version. Im also not keen on putting some logic into the object which, upon being clonedduplicated, checks whats going on and decides if it should load in these resources. Instead, a helpful person suggested I create a kind of shell object and when it gets cloned, it were to return this more derived version containing the resources allowing for me to both use RAII and lazy initialization.p  pBut Im having some trouble implementing this, and Im starting to wonder if I can even do it the way Im thinking it should be done. Right now it looks like thisp  precodeclass widgetSpawner  public widget  public     widgetSpawner     widgetSpawner  private     widget mPrototypeWidget        Blueprint with which to spawn new elements   class widgetAudioShell  public widget  public      widgetAudioShellstdstring pathToAudioFile     widgetAudioShell const widgetAudioShellamp other      widgetAudioShell      virtual widgetAudio clone const  return new widgetAudiothis     private     stdstring mPathToAudioFile    class widgetAudio  public widgetAudioShell  public      widgetAudioAudioEngineAudioTrack ampaTrack     widgetAudio const widgetAudioamp other      widgetAudio const widgetAudioShellamp other       widgetAudio      virtual widgetAudio clone const  return new widgetAudiothis     private      AudioEngineAudioTrack ampmATrack  codepre  pObviously, this is not workable as the shell doesnt know the object thats using it to derive a new class. So it cannot return it via the clone function. However, if I keep the two inheritancewise independent as in they both inherit from widget, then the compiler complains about lack of covariance which I think makes sense Or maybe its because I am again having the trouble of properly defining one before the other.p  pEssentially widgetAudioShell needs to know about widgetAudio so it can return a new copy. widgetAudio needs to know about widgetAudioShell so it can read its member functions when being createdcloned.p  pIf I am not mistaken, this circular dependency is there because of my like of using references rather than pointers, and if I have to use pointers, then suddenly all my other widgets need to do the same which Id find quite hellish. Im hoping someone whos had their fingers in something similar might provide some wisdomp

Negative 4 pHi I am wondering if there is a workflow that can be set up in sharepoint designer that can track changes made to a list. Just say i have a list named people which has 3 columns name, age and location. What i want to do is send an email off when any list item has been changed and state what was changed. So for example if the name column was changed from john to paul, an alert email would be sent and would say  the people list has changed . The name column has changed from john to paul. p
Negative 4 pI use the D3 visualization library for a lot of projects and find myself copying and pasting a lot of boilerplate code for each one.

Negative 4 pIm experiencing some odd behavior when I bind a callback to codeltConfiguregtcode on a Label Im using to contain an image I want to resize as its containing Toplevel is resized.p  pAccording to the documentation, the codeltConfiguregtcode callback is supposed to get called when the user resizes the window i.e. the Toplevel. What Im finding is that the callback is getting called with no user interaction. In fact, it seems to be getting called when I update the image emfromem the handler in response to the resize, which leads to an annoying loop which ends when the user moves  the window. Every call has codeevent.widthcode andor codeevent.heightcode slightly larger or smaller, depending on how Ive resized the image. Its almost as though the call I make to set the new image codeLabel.configureimagenewImagecode was triggering the callback, but this makes no sense.p  pIve tried tracing this with pdb, but all I find is a call coming from Tkinter.Tk.mainloop with no indication of what led to it. Ive also tried to duplicate this with a small demo program which I could include here, but cannot, so Im hoping someone might at least be able to answer the questionp  pApart from user interaction or any explicit call in my own   code, what could cause a codeltConfiguregtcode callback to be calledp  pThanks.p

Negative 4 pIm working on a large web application which has about 10K lines of JavaScript code without taking into account the thirdparty libraries. In order to speed up page loading it has been decided to automatically concatenate every script file into a large script that gets loaded and cached on the client the first time the application is accessed. This poses a problem due to the fact that each page had its own script which contained all JavaScript required in essentially the same function.br Now if an error occurs in one of the scripts it is really hard to tell where that error came from, since everything is rolled into the same script which is added to each page, as opposed to using explicit codescriptcode declarations in each page as was done before.br Is there a JavaScript pattern for solving this issue Im thinking of something similar to the AngularJS modules that can be bound to certain containers inside a web applications pages.br However, I would like a simple, custom, solution, as were short on time and we dont have time to implement a framework in our application. It should apply certain scripts modules only to their respective pages and it should allow developers to explicitly declare any other scripts modules that certain scripts rely on.br Also, implementing an exception handling system to notify users in the Firebug console, for example from which module an exception originated if the pages module relies on other modules would be great. Is there a common means of solving such issues in JavaScript without relying on frameworksp

Negative 4 pI have a form that contains two elements a codeCheckedListBoxcode and a codeCheckBoxcode. The codeCheckBoxcode, which is called codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, is used to checkuncheck all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode. I achieve this via a codeCheckedChangedcode event handler associated with the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, so that when it is checked, all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode are checked, and vice versa. This works fine.p  pI also have code that unchecks the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode when the user unchecks one of the CheckBoxes in the codeCheckedListBoxcode. For example, if the user checks the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, and then unchecks one of the items, the Select All codeCheckBoxcode should be unchecked. This is achieved via the codeCheckedListBox.ItemCheckedcode event handler.

But I dont like the idea of using code2to3code, nor supporting both Python 2 and Python 3 using the same code. Because its important for me that my code will be beautiful, and I dont find code written for both Python 2 and Python 3 to be beautiful.p  pWhat I want is to have 2 separate source folders, one for Python 2.x and one for Python 3.x. This will allow me to write each version of the code tailored to the respective major Python version. I want both folders to be in the same repo, and codesetup.pycode will choose between them dynamically depending on the version of Python running it. So far so good. p  pNow, here is where I need help I want to be able to do merges from my Python 2.x source folder to my Python 3.x source folder. Why When I develop a feature on the Python 2.x folder, I want have those feature on the Python 3.x version too. I dont want to copy them manually. I want to merge them into the Python 3.x folder, and I fully expect to have wonderful merge fails where Ill have to use my judgement to decide how to merge features that were implemented for Python 2.x into code that was modified for Python 3.x.p  pThe question is How can I do that Those folders are folders inside a Git repo, theyre not Git repos themselves. I thought about using Git submodules, which Ive never used before, but reading about them online paints a scary picture. The term sobmodules had been thrown around.p  pAny other ideas how I could merge between these folders in my Git repop

Negative 4 pI am facing a weird issue with codeUIPopoverControllercode. While creating the popover, we have set passthrough views property.

Negative 4 pI am developing an iOS app and I am trying to do it with strongtestdriven developmentstrong. Ive been reading a lot on the subject and one of the things I came across in a a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclickB007RNK0W6 relnofollowbooka is that tests are supposed to be strongfast, repeatable and reliablestrong. As a consequence, when writing a test for networking code, the test should simulate the network, so that it can be executed regardless of network availability.p  pIn my code I have a method that retrieves an image from the internet with a URL, scales it and stores it in the file system using dataWithContentsOfURL from NSDatap  precode void getImageNSString imageUrl       UIImage image  [UIImage imageWithData         [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL[NSURL URLWithStringimageUrl]]]       Scale image      Save image in storage   codepre  pMy question is what would be a good approach to test this method, so that the test passes when the code is correct and fails when it isnt, without taking into account possible network failuresp  pCurrently in my tests I am ignoring the fact that the method needs a connection, and just expect the outcome to be correct. However, I already see how this can become a problem when my test suit grows, since they already take a considerable amount of time to run. More importantly, I dont want my tests to fail just because there isnt a good network connection, as I believe that is not their purpose. I appreciate any suggestions.p

Negative 4 pI have a Javascript library Im working on.  It can be selfhosted or run from another server.  The script makes a number of AJAX calls and the preferred method is making POST requests to the same host as the including page.  To allow for crossdomain calls it also supports JSONP, but this limits the amount of data that can be sent 2K to safely accommodate most modern browsers URL length limits.p  pObviously the user including the script knows where theyre getting it from and could manually select JSONP as needed, but in the interest of simplifying things, Id like to detect, within the script itself, whether the script was loaded from the same host as the page including it or not.p  pIm able to grab the script element with jQuery but doing a script.attrsrc is only returning a relative path e.g. jsmyscript.js not a hrefhttphostname.comjsmyscript.js relnofollowhttphostname.comjsmyscript.jsa even when its being loaded from a different host.p  pIs this possible and if so, how would I go about itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4 pstrongUPDATEstrong Got it Answer posted below... I will clean up the question so it may be more useful to someone else.p  pI have a service that uses a library to generate thumbnails from html pages using a WebBrowser control. That works fine but I need to create a WCF service that allows you to pass in a uri, then the service converts that to a thumbnail and returns it. Ive tried it as a Stream and a byte[]. It creates the image in the service, I save it as a file just to prove it, but when I consume it I get data more than I send and I am unable to save it as a viewable image.

Negative 4 pfirst of all I am sorry if this topic has already been discussed somewhere else but I could not find anything relevant when searching.p  pMy problem is the following I have 4 vectors with partially overlapping names and I want to organize all these data into a matrix. I want the final matrix to have an entry for all the names present in at least one of the input vectors. I used the following code.p  precodeIDs lt uniquecnamesv1, namesv2, namesv3, namesv4  mat lt matrixcv1[IDs], v2[IDs], v3[IDs], v4[IDs], nrowlengthIDs, ncol4 mat[is.namat] lt 0   This last line is to convert NAs generated when the entry isnt present in all vectors into 0 values.  codepre  pIt works well but, as I have a total of entries  2.2 millions, this is extremely slow it took 2.5 days to run.... I am thus looking for a way to speed up the process.p  pI tried to use other structures e.g. to create a data frame instead of a matrix but without great improvement. After some tests, it seems that the bottleneck is the following step even when considered individuallyp  precodev1[IDs] codepre  pwhich is repeated for each of the vectors 1 to 4. Note that typically only 50 of the names overlap between two vectors  and therefore that only 50 of IDsnames used for indexing are initially present in the names of the vector.p  pI monitored a bit the CPU and memory used  during the process and it seems that it is not a memory issue the 6 free Gb remained free during the process.p  pI would appreciate any hint on how to make this process faster. As I have to repeat this process several times, I cant really afford to wait 2 days each time I have to generate such an object.p  pThanks. p  pPhilippe.p

Negative 4 pI am writing a code where I have an original matrix of data of 42 rows, and 6 columns. I am trying to randomly select 12 rows from this matrix MAtrix B and get 2 sets of regression coefficients from 2 sets of 2 columns of data within this matrix. From there, I want to use the newly calulated regression coefficients and predict the values using the data from the other 30 points in the matrix that were not selected in the random sample Matrix C. p  pI keep getting an error when trying to run the code below.

Can someone please throw some light on the following aspects w.r.t. both the frameworksp  ol lipPerformance Will either one framework perform better than the other for any reasonpli lipCommunication within the app viewmodel to viewmodel or between modules etc I have read that MVVM Light has Messenging Service which appears to be fairly easy as well. But PRISM does not appear to have any equivalent. Is that true How would PRISM handle interactionspli lipUnit Testing Have read that PRISM supports Unit Testing better. Can we still write NUNIT or VSTS tests in MVVM Light alsopli ol

Negative 4 pI have been trying to integrate springsecurity in one of my grails applications. As mentioned in the tutorial for spring security, I installed the plugin using the following codep  pstrongBuildConfig.groovystrong I added the following codep  precoderepositories  mavenRepo httprepo.spring.iomilestone   plugins  compile springsecuritycore2.0RC2  codepre  pLater I cleaned the code and compiled it to ensure that the dependencies are downloaded. I have also checked the .grails folder to ensure that the dependencies are downloaded.p  pNext I created the User and Role classes. Note I have named the classes as Person and Authority respectively. p  pAfter this I created the SecureController and have not added any security access annotations, but still I cannot access the secure controller. The control directly redirects to login controllerp  pstrongQuestion 1strong Is it that after using spring security plugin every page needs authentication. Is there a way to access a page without logging inp  pNext I added the Secured annotation to the SecureController. The Secured annotation does not get detected at all though it is present in the plugins folder for the project. Initially I thought I missed something so I created the project again from start implementing the same steps. However this time the plugin gets detectedp  pstrongQuestion 2strong Why does springsecurity plugin behave so inconsistentlyp  pI tried to access the SecureController without logging in, I get the following error.p  pEL1008Epos 0 Field or property ADMINROLE cannot be found on object of type org.springframework.security.web.access.expression.WebSecurityExpressionRootp  pI also get the same error after logging in and trying to access the controller.p  pstrongQuestion 3strong Is it that I have missed any dependencies that need to be specified.p  pIn the login page the form leads to some action jsecuritycheck. I did not notice this action in any of the controllers.p  pstrongQuestion 4strong Do I need to create a new action for the with this namep  pKindly help me sorting out this isssue. Thanks a lot in advance for the help.p
Negative 4 pThis is a follow up question to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20591718collisiondetectionina2dmazewiththickwallsquestion that I posted last nighta. I have to write a game in a Windows Form for school, and I am creating a maze game in which a player must navigate through a maze before they are killed. As a maze game, some collision detection must be used to make sure that the player doesnt simply run through the walls this would be quite a boring game. Ive implemented a feature which prevents this based on the question that I asked last night, but Im getting some weird results.p  pWhen the player touches a wall, the game stops them, and the player ends up getting stuck. The player CANNOT move unless they press a combination of keys to move through the wall my game uses WASD, so if I touch a wall, I can press W  A and go through the wall to the other side where my player gets unstuck.p  pThis is my collision codep  precode                 This goes in the main class                 foreach Rectangle wall in mazeWalls                                      if playerRectangle.IntersectsWithwall                                              player.Stop                                          codepre  pThis is the players movement codep  precode    public void MoveDirection dir               First, check amp save the current position.         this.lastX  this.x         this.lastY  this.y          if dir  Direction.NORTH                      if CheckCollision                              this.y  moveSpeed                          else                              this.y  1                                else if dir  Direction.SOUTH                      if CheckCollision                              this.y  moveSpeed                          else                              this.y  1                                 else if dir  Direction.EAST                      if CheckCollision                              this.x  moveSpeed                          else                              this.x  1                                else if dir  Direction.WEST                      if CheckCollision                              this.x  moveSpeed                          else                              this.x  1                              codepre  pMy codeCheckCollisioncode methodp  precode    private bool CheckCollision                           First, check to see if the player is hitting any of the boundaries of the game.         if this.x lt 0                      isColliding  true                  else if this.x gt 748                      isColliding  true                  else if this.y lt 0                      isColliding  true                  else if this.y gt 405                      isColliding  true                  else if isColliding                      isColliding  false                   Second, check for wall collision.         return isColliding      codepre  pThe codeStopcode method p  precode    public void Stop              this.x  lastX         this.y  lastY                  codepre  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comFPPz7nx.gif relnofollowHerea is a gif that I have uploaded so that you can see the behavior of the player with the maze walls.

Im having problems with redeclared styles as the same styles are declared in the v7 AppCompat and HoloEverywhere, redeclared classes same case as before, and I cannot come up with any solutions.p  pAny ideas or should  I give upp  pThanksp

I assume it is because the templates are added after the scripts are fired.p  pEdit so i have no idea how jfiddle working, and i cant get the tmpl working on there.  but here is the basic of my codep  phtml codeltdiv idcontentStuffgtltdivgtcodep  pjavascriptp  pcodeltscript defergt     window.loadfunction       .templatetemplate, template     var item1  []     item1.name  ted     var contentDiv  contentStuff     template.tmpl[item1].appendTocontentDiv      focus stuff here  lt scriptgtcodep  pcodeltscript idtemplate typetextxjquerytmplgt     ltdiv idTest gt         ltpgt nameltpgt     ltdivgt ltscriptgtcodep  pAny help would be awesome. p  pThanks p
Negative 4 pI have several subclasses that extend a superclass, and I want to let the command line interface user select which subclass to use. All subclasses have the same constructor form. p  pFor example, I want to be able to call coderun subclassSubclass1code, resulting in a call to codeSubclass obj  new Subclassarg1, arg2code. I can think of several ways to do this, but I figure this pattern comes up often enough that theres a standard or accepted way to do it if not, I want to do whats most elegant and simple.p  pHere is my current proposal assuming there is a codeNamespacecode object that contains the command line argumentsp  precodeSuperClass createObjectNamespace namespace,                          ArgumentClass1 arg1,                          ArgumentClass2 arg2 throws Exception      MapltString, Classlt extends SuperClassgtgt classMap          ImmutableMap.ltString, Classlt extends SuperClassgtgtbuilder             .putsubclass1, SubClass1.class             .putsubclass2, SubClass2.class             .build     Constructorlt extends SuperClassgt constructor          classMap.getnamespace.getStringsubclass             .getConstructorArgumentClass1.class, ArgumentClass2.class     return constructor.newInstancearg1, arg2  codepre  pWhen the subclass constructors all take no arguments, this can be simplified by not using a codeConstructorcode and doing codereturn classMap.getnamespace.getsubclass.newInstancecode. Note that one drawback is that this can throw one of several exceptions codeInstantiationExceptioncode, codeIllegalAccessExceptioncode, codeNoSuchMethodExceptioncode, codeInvocationTargetExceptioncode that need to be handled either here or upstream.p  pIs this reasonable Is it the best way to go Is there a standard pattern to usep

Negative 4 pI am running a site in which I am using SignalR with a custom scaleout backplane that allows us to push out realtime data to users connected to any of our load balanced web servers.p  pI recently found out that the Kendo UI components for MVC which we use for other site features can be configured to use SignalR rather than AJAX for binding with the data model. It seems like using web sockets via SignalR could potentially offer a performance boost over using AJAX as we are now. However, I would ideally like to let our kendo components access a SignalR instance that only uses whatever web server they connect to rather than using the instance with the scaleout backplane since that would involve a lot of overgead that isnt necessary for that data binding.p  pI should mention that there would be cases where we would have one page with one partial view that uses one SignalR configuration and another partial view that uses the other.p  pIs this something that can be done If so, are there recommended ways of going about doing sop

Negative 4 pI have inherited a code that has worked for some time in our company already, and now Im clueless as to what exactly is wrong with it. Without further ado, lets get to the issue.p  pstrongHow does it workstrongp  pWe have a system of communication set as following JavaScript ltAjax Web Services Proxy lt Web Services Basically, JavaScript sends which service to call, which method with which arguments to the proxy, proxy then constructs Http Request, and that is then sent to one of our Web Services.p  pstrongWhats the problemstrongp  pThe new thing thats happening now is that I am trying to attach a SOAP header to the Http request. Rigt now, the JavaScript code is irrelevant  Im fairly sure the issue lies somewhere between the proxy and the web services. The code constructing the HTTP request looks like thisp  precodeHttpWebRequest basicRequest  HttpWebRequestWebRequest.Createthis.url basicRequest.ContentType  applicationjson charsetutf8  basicRequest.Method  POST basicRequest.AllowWriteStreamBuffering  false  if Ticket  string.Empty ampamp Ticket  null      basicRequest.Headers[UserAuthenticationHeader]  Ticket  codepre  pNow when I check the request before calling thep  precodethis.HttpResponse  HttpWebResponseHttpRequest.GetResponse codepre  pmethod, debugger tells me the header is there. To be more precise, these are the contents of Headers attributep  precodeContentType applicationjson charsetutf8  UserAuthenticationHeader userticket  Host localhost25691  ContentLength 55  Expect 100continue codepre  pNow, the appropriate method in the web services just got called. Now I would expect that this codep  precodepublic class UserAuthenticationHeader  SoapHeader      public string Ticket  get set    [WebServiceNamespace  http, Description  ] [System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService] public class DataGetService  System.Web.Services.WebService      public virtual UserAuthenticationHeader UserAuthenticationHeader  get set       [WebMethodDescription  Gets all modules]     [SoapHeaderUserAuthenticationHeader]     public ModulesDS GetMetadataModulesGuid GlobalUserId             Authentication.AuthenticateUserAuthenticationHeader         return Sql.GetMetadataModulesGlobalUserId       codepre  pis going to fill the contents of UserAuthenticationHeader, based on a couple of MSDN articles, that this would insert the value of UserAuthenticationHeader into UserAuthenticationHeader property. But it doesnt. When I get here, its null. So yeah, what am I doing wrong Ive been struggling with this issue for past 5 hours and just cant figure out anything. Im generally unable to transfer any headers whatsoever, and I have even tried to parse trough SoapUnknownHeader to no avail.p  pI have tried following a couple of tutorials on how to send over soap headers, but I mostly just wrote the same code that was already present in the application. I tried different ways of inserting the headers into HttpWebRequest, but all just basically do the same thing not surprising. Other than that, Ive not been able to find any good sources on this particular communication, so Im just stuck. p

From what I saw, the SDK offers two ways of getting the MNC  via the Configuration API or via the TelephonyManager API.p  ul liVia the Configuration API  the field mnc is 0 and not the socalled MNCZERO, which according to the documentation is not 0 per se but rather undefined though field mcc is 604 which is correctli liVia the TelephonyManager API  the method getSimOperator returns 60400 which is 100 correctli ul  pSo it raises a few questions p  ol liWhy do those API that seems semantically identical have different resultsli liWhy does the field Configuration.mnc is an int and not a String Because Im not sure how you can represent 00 in a int field... or how you can make the difference between 00 and 000 or even between  01 and 001 which are all valid and distinct MNC values.li lipAnd most importantly, on which of these API if not a third one Android relies when it comes to decide whether it should use the defaults resources or the qualified resourcesp  ul liNote1  I tested the same thing with another particular operator network and it worked fine so it seems the MNC 00 is the main concern hereli liNote2  Im testing from France therefore Im in roaming conditionli ulli ol  pThanks in advance for the headsup.p

Negative 4 pI want to track on google analytics the 404 errors. Each time there is a 404 a specific part of my page has 404 string as content. So, I create a Universal analytics tag.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMb3fj.png altenter image description herep  pThen I create a custom javascript macrop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comurtXy.png altenter image description herep  precodefunction         var viewcontainer  document.getElementsByClassNameviewcontainer        var content  viewcontainer[0].childNodes[3].innerHTML        var error404  parseIntcontent if there is an error page it returns 404, else it returns NaN return error404  codepre  pThe macro reads the contents of the part of my page on which the 404 should appear and returns it. If it is an error it will return 404 otherwise it will return some other content.p  pThen I create a rule to fire the tag each time the macro is equals to 404p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLzPMj.png altenter image description herep  pI create the version of google tags and publish it. Then by adding some random string on my url I can trigger a 404 error page. But on the google analytics nothing is tracked. Any idea what I am doing wrong Is this the right way of using custom macros Is there any problem on my macro or is something that I forget to dop
Negative 4 pIm trying to create simple bot for a browserbased game. I was using GecoFX, its perfect. I can do everything that I want with that library. posting forms, getting values, clicking buttons etc. everything you want. Also Im able to use proxy with GeckoFX too. But Im having big trouble with this library. When you set proxy once, its global. I mean you set a proxy and created 2 geckoFX controls, both of them using same proxy and same cookies. when geckoFX1 logins to game if you go to same URL with geckoFX2 the pages are same with geckoFX1. Because their profiles are same, using same cookies and proxies... What should I do Do you know another method to do my job Also geckoFX is open source project. Can I edit the proxy and profile properties to make them unglobalp  pThis is how you set proxyp  precodeGecko.GeckoPreferences.User[network.proxy.ssl]  txtIP.Text Gecko.GeckoPreferences.User[network.proxy.sslport]  intPort Gecko.GeckoPreferences.User[network.proxy.type]  1 Gecko.ProfileDirectory    That property stores cookies codepre  pAnd maybe I can edit and make this likep  precodegeckoWebBrowser1.Preferences.User[proxy]  IP geckoWebBrowser1.Preferences.User[proxy]  Port geckoWebBrowser1.Preferences.User[proxy]  IP geckoWebBrowser1.PorfileDir   codepre  pPlease dont reply like yes, you can. Of course I can, I already know that but how Where should I editp
Negative 4 pIve got a table with lots of texts in different languages. The table and all the fields are codeiso88591code. The data that is in the fields was encoded in different charsets before it was inserted. It was not converted to codelatin1code, so it often shows up as gibberish. It can be one of thesep  ul licodeiso88591codeli licodeiso88597codeli licodewindows1250codeli licodewindows1251codeli licodewindows1254codeli licodewindows1257codeli ul  pI know which column maps to which kind of encoding.p  pWhat I would like to do is convert them to codeutf8code when I select them, in a way that they will not show up as gibberish in the final output.p  pMy idea was to use codeCONVERTcode, but a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.5encharsetconvert.html relnofollowthe docsa are only talking about converting a string to another encoding. The strings encoding seems to be taken from the fields encoding. But thats broken for me.p  pHeres an example of what data looks like if I look at it directly in the DB.p  precode    .  Land Rover codepre  pThis is supposed to be Ukranian and was encoded in codecp1251code before being put into the codelatin1code field. If I simply codeSELECT foo FROM barcode it without any conversion and display it to a webbrowser, telling it to use codecp1251code it will show up correctly as cyrillic text in the browser.p  pWhat I think I need to do now is ignore the fact that the field is codelatin1code and convert from codecp1251code to codeutf8code or codeutf8mb4code.p  pHowever, this is not doing what I wantp  precodeselect convertfooua using cp1251 from mytable codepre  pIt comes out as this, so the codelatin1code is obviously still in there.p  precode    .  Land Rover codepre  pI tried codeCASTcode as well, but to the same result. How do I tell it to ignore the codelatin1code and just convert to codecp1251code, and how do I go to codeutf8code from therep

Negative 4 pcode.Netcode introduced us dynamic arrays like codeArrayListcode and codeListltTgtcode. I have always wondered how does codeCLRcode handle the capacity of dynamic arrays. I have read about that, and now I know that these classes has internal field with the name of codedefaultCapacitycode. And when you instantiate the codeListltTgtcode class without specifying the capacity, the initial capacity of the codeListltTgtcode is zero. On the first Add operation to the codeListltTgtcode instance, it will increase the capacity with the default capacity being strongfourstrong, which is stored in the internal field codedefaultCapacitycode of the codeListltTgtcode class. And  on every expansion of the  codeListltTgtcode class, a new capacity of the codeListltTgtcode will be calculated and it will be two times that of the previous capacity.  But we know that codeListltTgtcode comes to life when we call one of the following three overloaded constructors.p  precodepublic List    capacity will be 0, 4, 8, 16, 32 ... public Listint capacity  public ListIEnumerableltTgt collection  codepre  pMy question is about how dows CLR increase the capacity of List if we instantiated it with the last two constructors. What if we instantiated it like thatp  precodeListltTgt myList  new ListltTgt19  codepre

Negative 4 pI have a view controller presenting another view controller with codemodalPresentationStyle  UIModalPresentationCustomcode. Things are set up so that part of the presenting view controllers view shows up underneath the presented view controllers view. In this state, the presenting view controller still handles autorotation correctly, and I handle rotation for the presented view controller using autolayout.p  pIm now trying to implement interactively dismissing the presented view controller using iOS 7s custom view controller transitioning API. It works except that, when the interactive dismissal is canceled, handling of autorotation stops working. It works again after the presented view controller is dismissed later. Why is this happening, and how can I fix thisp  pstrongEDITstrong emHere is code you can run to demonstrate the problem. A view pops up from below, and you can dismiss it by swiping it down. If you cancel dismissal by not swiping it all the way down, the presenting view controllers view no longer responds to rotations, and the presented view controllers view has messedup layout.emp  pstrongEDITstrong Here is the link to the code below as an Xcode project a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BwcBqUuDfCG2YlhVWE1QekhUWlkedituspsharing relnofollowhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BwcBqUuDfCG2YlhVWE1QekhUWlkedituspsharingap  pSorry for the massive code dump, but I dont know what Im doing wrong. Heres a sketch of what is going on codeViewController1code presents codeViewController2code. codeViewController1code implements codeUIViewControllerTransitioningDelegatecode, so it is returning the animationinteractive controllers for the transitions. codeViewController2code has a pan gesture recognizer that drives the interactive dismissal it implements codeUIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioningcode to serve as the interactive controller for dismissal. It also keeps a reference to the animation controller for dismissal to finish the transition if the user drags the view down far enough. Finally, there are two animation controller objects. codePresentAnimationControllercode sets up the autolayout constraints to handle rotations for the presented view controllers view, and codeDismissAnimationControllercode finishes up the dismissal.p  pstrongViewController1.hstrongp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface ViewController1  UIViewController ltUIViewControllerTransitioningDelegategt  end codepre  pstrongViewController1.mstrongp  precodeimport ViewController1.h  import ViewController2.h  import PresentAnimationController.h import DismissAnimationController.h  implementation ViewController1   idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil      self  [super initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenibBundleOrNil]     if self          self.title  View 1          self.navigationItem.prompt  Press Present and then swipe down to dismiss.         self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitlePresent styleUIBarButtonItemStylePlain targetself actionselectorpressedPresentButton]          return self    voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]       Some subview just to check if layout is working.

Negative 4 pI do not believe this is possible but thought I may as well ask, before I go through each row correcting dates in this paradox table.p  pIssue I have is  I am importing a Paradox table through the SQL Interface right click Import however some of the DateTime Fields in Paradox are for example 17110201.

Negative 4 pSuppose weve got two teams  TeamA and TeamB.br TeamA maintains the historical project ProjectA with strongsubversionstrong, and TeamB forked projectA months ago to create ProjectB which is maintained under strongGitstrong.br In reality, ProjectB is ProjectA  some additionnal directories and files, and must stay that way. So, regularly, TeamB have to synchronise ProjectB with ProjectA lets say, every month when ProjectA is considered as stable enough, that is to say that all commits of ProjectA must be replayed over ProjectB.    p  pIn the long term, ProjectA will be abandonned and ProjectB will become the main project.  p  pWhat would be a proper way to regularly report all trunk svn commits toward the ProjectB git master branch emI will never need to perform the reverse operation Git  SVN is out of scope.embr Currently, I use gitsvn to cherry pick the range of commits of the last month of ProjectA and apply them to ProjectBs master branch. But it requires to search for the last SVN commit I applied last month in order to cherry pick the good range of commits.  p  pI was wondering if instead of a cherry pick, I could use a persistent Git mirror of the Subversion repo, and use a simple svn merge every month or something like that.p  pAny idea of a usual workflow for thatp

I have already tried setting alwaysusedefaulttargetfalse as well as omitting that property altogether and the behavior is the same.p  pAm I missing something  Should Spring pass along the POST request after authentication or does that not happen by design for some reasonp  pHere is my Spring security configp  precode    ltbeansbeans xmlnshttpwww.springframework.orgschemasecurity     xmlnsbeanshttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans      xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocationhttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans     httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeans4.0.xsd     httpwww.springframework.orgschemasecurity     httpwww.springframework.orgschemasecurityspringsecurity3.2.xsdgt      lthttp autoconfigtruegt         ltintercepturl patternadmin accessROLEUSER gt         ltformlogin              loginpagelogin.htm              defaulttargeturlhello.htm              alwaysusedefaulttargetfalse             authenticationfailureurllogin.htmerror              usernameparameterusername             passwordparameterpassword gt         ltlogout logoutsuccessurllogin.htmlogout gt         lt enable csrf protection gt         ltcsrfgt     lthttpgt      ltauthenticationmanagergt       ltauthenticationprovidergt         ltuserservicegt         ltuser nameadmin passwordpassword authoritiesROLEUSER gt         ltuser namesuper passwordman authoritiesROLESUPERUSER gt         ltuserservicegt       ltauthenticationprovidergt     ltauthenticationmanagergt  ltbeansbeansgt codepre  pHere is my jsp to initiate the test a link to test the GET and a form to test the POSTp  precodelt include fileWEBINFjspinclude.jsp gt lt taglib prefixform urihttpwww.springframework.orgtagsform gt  lthtmlgt   ltheadgtlttitlegtTEST SECURITYlttitlegtltheadgt   ltbodygt         ltpgtlta hrefadminsecuritylanding.htmgtGETltagtltpgt         ltformform  methodPOST actionadminsecuritylanding.htmgtltinput typesubmit valuePOSTgtltformformgt    ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is the landing page which is a secured resourcep  precodelt include fileWEBINFjspinclude.jsp gt lt taglib prefixform urihttpwww.springframework.orgtagsform gt  lthtmlgt   ltheadgtlttitlegtTEST SECURITY LANDING PAGElttitlegtltheadgt   ltbodygt         ltpgtYOU MADE ITltpgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pand here is my test controllerp  precodepackage springapp.web  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView  import org.apache.commons.logging.Log import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory   Controller public class TestController        Logger for this class and subclasses      protected final Log logger  LogFactory.getLoggetClass      RequestMappingvaluetest, method RequestMethod.GET     public ModelAndView methodGet                       logger.infoFound its way to the GET method          ModelAndView model  new ModelAndView          model.setViewNamesecuritytest          return model            RequestMappingvalueadminsecuritylanding, methodRequestMethod.POST     public ModelAndView sendToLandingPOST                       logger.infoFound its way to the GET method          ModelAndView model  new ModelAndView          model.setViewNameadminsecuritylanding          return model            RequestMappingvalueadminsecuritylanding, method RequestMethod.GET     public ModelAndView sendToLandingGET                       logger.infoFound its way to the GET method          ModelAndView model  new ModelAndView          model.setViewNameadminsecuritylanding          return model        codepre  pI can include more of the Spring configuration if its relevant, but where the app is working fine with a GET but misbehaving in my opinion with a POST, Im thinking its isolated to the pieces Ive shown here.p  pIt seems to me that Spring security should be able to intercept a POST and pass along the POST after authentication, just like a GET.p  pAny hints or help would be appreciated.

Negative 4 pJust to give you guys a start with the background of my project, I have a desktop application and this basically works with our VOIP System. We wrote app in Both VB and C and its a winform desktop application.p  pThe whole project is working fine. But it works in our local systems. My boss wants me to take this application on browsers.p  pMy query is, is it possible that whatever dll and ActiveX controls given by my VOIP provider can be used by ASP.NET application too. So lets say right now I am tracking the calls that are coming in using this ActiveX control and some dlls, so can I use the same ActiveX and dll in ASP and track itp  pWhy I am asking is if that is possible, not specific to our VOIP provider Generally then we will go on and hire ASP guys and do development stuff.p  pLooking forward to have expert comments from you guys. Eagerly waiting.p  pstrongEDIT 1strong Just to add, there DLL and ActiveX control actually communicating with our VOIP System.p

Negative 4 pI am having some trouble with a Spring JMS application and have narrowed down the problem to be either a bug in the Spring framework or some weird misconfiguration on my part.p  pI listen to messages on a JMS JBoss 5 queue with a DefaultMessageListenerContainer which is configured like thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeDefaultMessageListenerContainer container  new DefaultMessageListenerContainer container.setSessionTransactedtrue container.setConnectionFactoryconnectionFactory A CachingConnecitonFactory container.setBackOffnew ExponentialBackOff container.setSessionAcknowledgeModeSession.SESSIONTRANSACTED container.setCacheLevelDefaultMessageListenerContainer.CACHENONE  .. more Queue specific configuration codepre  pI use a MessageListenerAdapter that is specified to call a certain handler method from my code and also is passed a a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringframeworkblobmasterspringjmssrcmainjavaorgspringframeworkjmssupportconverterMarshallingMessageConverter.java relnofollowMarshallingMessageConvertera which is set up with a JAXB marshaller to handle my classes.p  pThe setup works perfectly as long as my handler method does not throw an Exception. If that happens the message is returned to the queue as it should be and is shortly reevaluated by the ListenerContainer. This is expected behavior. However, the unmarshalling on the second try fails, because the MarshallingMessageConverter a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringframeworkblobmasterspringjmssrcmainjavaorgspringframeworkjmssupportconverterMarshallingMessageConverter.javaL295 relnofollowdoes not reset the pointer on the bytearray of the ByteMessage that is received from the queuea. This would not be a problem if the MessageContainer would create a new object for the second evaluation of the message, but it does infact pass the exact same object to the converter.p  pMy current workaround is to subclass the MarshallingMessageConverter and to overwrite the codeunmarshalFromBytesMessage..code method to do a codemessage.resetcode before calling codereadBytescode.p  pAs mentioned above, I can imagine two reasons for this behavior 1. This is simply a bug in the Spring provided MessageConverter this is also true for the SimpleMessageConverter. 2. My configuration is somehow messed up and should be different, creating a new object on every subsequent message receipt even if it is the same message on the queue.p  pShould I submit a fix to the Spring framework or this behavior intendedp

Token is valid or invalid, so handling errors in this case is much easier.p  pIf I save JWT and user profile object as a string in storage on client side then this is rendundant and user can change manually that object and app can go down.p  pI prefer saving only JWT in storage on client side after successfully login, but i need some advice, how organize code in that case How fetch user profile object after full page refreshp  pPlease help.p

Hence if consumer exhausted buffer setting n to 0, producer has incremented it to 1, before consumer checking n and waiting on line 24. This line should have blocked consumer since buffer was exhausted, but it did not, since producer incremented n meanwhile.p blockquote  pPrecisely it says below with diagramp  blockquote   pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUnpCw.png altenter image description here   There is, however, a flaw in this program.When the consumer has exhausted   the buffer, it needs to reset the delay semaphore so that it will be forced to wait   until the producer has placed more items in the buffer. This is the purpose of the   statement if n  0 semWaitB delay. Consider the scenario outlined in   Table 5.4. In line 14, the consumer fails to execute the semWaitB operation. The   consumer did indeed exhaust the buffer and set n to 0 line 8, but the producer   has incremented n before the consumer can test it in line 14. The result is a   semSignalB not matched by a prior semWaitB. The value of 1 for n in line 20   means that the consumer has consumed an item from the buffer that does not   existp blockquote  pI understood it a bit, but still filling fuzzy.p  ul lipFirst thing, their is missing codesemWaitBdelaycode in the table for second execution of consumer. I mean, in table between line 14 and 15, there should be codesemWaitBdelaycode. If that is put, the consumer will no longer consume nonexistent data item from the buffer. Am I going wrongpli lipSecond, I dont think its problematic if producer has produced data between line 23 and 24 of consumer, since it will appropriately set states of n and delay regardless of state of consumer.pli ul

Negative 4 pI have an app up and running which uses old iOS xib design methods of springs and struts. Each screen contains two xib files for iPhone 3.5 inch and iPhone 4 inch, all programmatic animations are slightly generically made such that they work on both resolutions.p  pSince the introduction of iPhone6 and iPhone6 Plus phones this all has kind of failed such that app views were appearing very small on these devices. I have used a workaround to make sure that the app scales up on 6 and 6Plus by removing required icon file for 6 and 6 plus resolutions which tells iOS that this app is made to support native resolution on these devices.p  pMy question is When I tried switching all views to autolayout and size classes spent like 4 days struggling every time something failed on the views. Some images only scale up in height, some hug to one side, some scrollviews show images inside them on one side only etc So I reverted to using the same technique of struts and springs.p  blockquote   ol   lipDo I really need to shift my views to Autolayout is there a way to avoid this or guidelines so that I may not need itpli   lipIf there is no way out of it, How do people usually make animations in AutoLayout views All animations are translation   animations, previously both devices had 320 width which made it   easier, how do we now handle different resolutions and make generic   translation animationspli   ol blockquote

Negative 4 pWith AFNetworking in iOS, what is the best way to determine if a failure response is a server error or connection errorp  pFor example, if an upload fails due to a connection error, I may want to retry the upload automatically after some time interval.  Conversely, if an upload fails because of a server error, I will want to permanently stop trying the request.  Errors where I would NOT want to retry would be most 400 and 500 errors.p  pPlease tell me how can I most easily determine if Im simply seeing a connection error or if I am seeing a server error p
Negative 4 pHere is the scenario...p  pI am working on an app I had an idea for, Im building it in ember with an express backend. I am using the codeexpresswscode so I can run the codewscode websocket package inside express better. I was not able to get just ws to work with express.p  pMy app will have two people connecting to two different urls that are socket connections, so that they can send and receive information to the server without the other getting it. At least thats the way Ive come up in my mind to do it.p  pWhat I want is when one user does an interaction over the socket, for that socket to send a message to the other socket to perform an action and send its information to the user connected on it.p  pI hope that makes sense. With expressws here is what I have done so far which works at a basic level.p  precodevar express  requireexpress var app  express var expressWs  requireexpresswsapp  app.usefunction req, res, next    console.logmiddleware   req.testing  testing   return next   app.get, functionreq, res, next     console.logbrowser connected   res.sendwelcome to the api browser   app.ws, functionws, req    console.logsocket connected   var object       message welcome to the socket api,     time Date.now.toString      ws.sendJSON.stringifyobject   app.listen1337 codepre  pI havent made the other connection yet but for the time being it will be the same, but when the user on one connection sends a certain message to their socket, I want that socket to perform something and then pass some data to the other socket so it can send some information to its user.p
Negative 4 pI am wondering what the optimal order is for a sequence of instructions like the one below on Intel processors between Core 2 and Westmere. This is ATampT syntax, so that the codepxorcode instructions are memory reads, and the codemovdqacode are memory writesp  precode    movdqa  xmm0, 12864rbx     movdqa  xmm1, 12880rbx     movdqa  xmm2, 12896rbx     movdqa  xmm3, 128112rbx     pxor    128rsp, xmm0     pxor    112rsp, xmm1     pxor    96rsp, xmm2     pxor    80rsp, xmm3     movdqa  xmm8, 64rbx     movdqa  xmm9, 80rbx     movdqa  xmm10, 96rbx     movdqa  xmm11, 112rbx     pxor    128r14, xmm8     pxor    112r14, xmm9     pxor    96r14, xmm10     pxor    80r14, xmm11     movdqa  xmm12, 64rdx     movdqa  xmm13, 80rdx     movdqa  xmm14, 96rdx     movdqa  xmm15, 112rdx     pxor    0r14, xmm12     pxor    16r14, xmm13     pxor    32r14, xmm14     pxor    48r14, xmm15 codepre  pcoder14code, coderspcode, coderdxcode, and coderbxcode are distinct multiples of 256. In other words, there are no nonobvious aliases in the instructions above and data has been laid out for aligned access to large blocks of data. All the memory lines being accessed are in the L1 cache.p  pOn the one hand, my understanding of Agner Fogs a hrefhttpwww.agner.orgoptimize relnofollowoptimization guidesa make me believe that it may be possible to get close to two instructions by cycle with an ordering like the one belowp  precodemovdqa  xmm0, 12864rbx movdqa  xmm1, 12880rbx pxor    128rsp, xmm0 movdqa  xmm2, 12896rbx pxor    112rsp, xmm1 movdqa  xmm3, 128112rbx pxor    96rsp, xmm2 movdqa  xmm8, 64rbx pxor    80rsp, xmm3 movdqa  xmm9, 80rbx pxor    128r14, xmm8 movdqa  xmm10, 96rbx pxor    112r14, xmm9 movdqa  xmm11, 112rbx pxor    96r14, xmm10 movdqa  xmm12, 64rdx pxor    80r14, xmm11 movdqa  xmm13, 80rdx pxor    0r14, xmm12 movdqa  xmm14, 96rdx pxor    16r14, xmm13 movdqa  xmm15, 112rdx pxor    32r14, xmm14 pxor    48r14, xmm15  codepre  pThis ordering attempts to take into account cache bank conflicts as described in Agner Fogs microachitecture.pdf by leaving an offset between the reads and the writes.p  pOn the other hand, another concern is that although the programmer knows that there are no aliases in the code above, they have no way to convey this information to the processor. May the interleaving of reads and writes introduce delays because of the processor has to take into account the possibility that a read is of a value that was modified by a write in the above instructions In that case obviously it would be better to do all the reads first, but since this is not possible for that particular sequence of instructions, perhaps getting all the writes done first would make sense.p  pIn short, there seems to be many possibilities here, and my intuition is not good enough to get a feeling of what is likely to happen with each of them.p  pEDIT if that matters, the code that comes before the sequence under consideration has been either loading the codexmmcode registers from memory or computing them with arithmetic instructions, and the code that comes after uses these registers either to write them to memory or as inputs to arithmetic instructions. The memory locations that have been written to are not reused immediately. coderbxcode, coderspcode, coder14code and coderdxcode are longlived registers that have to come from the register file.p

Negative 4 pSay I have an app that send an email to a user when something interesting in the system happens.  The system would add a codesendNotificationcode job to a message queue, which when processed sends out the email.p  pI want to be able to add these jobs to the queue whenever something interesting happens, but have the system wait for 10 minutes to gather and group all these notifications into one email, rather than send out multiple email within that short timeframe.p  pHow would this be implemented in a system such as RabbitMQ  As far as I can tell delay functionality isnt built in for a start, and you cant update messages once they are sent.  So are there any patterns recommended for implementing this kind of thingp

However, after the java update, I kept getting the error Could not find or load main class weka.classifiers.meta.FilteredClassifier. I couldnt figure it out because the directory names and class names were exactly correct. So, I changed the code to thisp  precodeECHO OFF  SET CLASSPATH  CProgram Files x86Weka36weka.jar FOR r I IN .arff DO      ECHO Running nI.arff     java cp CProgram Files x86Weka36weka.jar weka.classifiers.meta.FilteredClassifier t nI.arff F weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute.Remove R 1,3,4,5 W weka.classifiers.functions.LinearRegression x 10 gtgt results.txt     ECHO gtgt results.txt  codepre  pAnd it worked again.

Negative 4 pI am using MySQL on my Windows laptop to perform indepth analysis of some medium sized enterprise datasets, looking for anomalies and missing data elements. Using somewhat sophisticated SQL code, I generate detailed reports to send out to the field for correction by the process managers. MySQL is very powerful and alows me to drill down as far into the data as needed to find the problems. For example, the business rules state that if there is an entry in table1, there must be one or more corresponding records in table2 and table3. If these records are not there, then the process is not allowed to move forward. My SQL scripts look for and report on these missing data points.p  pOne drawback with using MySQL for this is that I must create a new import script for each new dataset that I bring in for analysis. Another is that when management expresses a need for a new report, it takes me time to develop the code to produce the report.p  pIs there a good GUI tool out there that will enable me to perform crosstable analysis with a GUI instead of needing to write a bunch of joins and other SQL queries Most of the tools I have seen seem to focus on data aggregation and statistical analysis, which is not what I need to do. I need something that detects deviations from defined business rules.p
Negative 4 pI saw some answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3494969easymock30mockingclassthrowsjavalangillegalstateexceptionnolastcallherea, but I think my problem is different.p  pI have a class that provides some query methods, like isFeatureBlaEnabled. To compute the answer to that, the method does a simple equals check on some string which is a member field of that class. I know it is a bit of overkill, but I wanted to write a unit test my idea was to inserted a mocked string that would be used for the check in that method. But of course, java.lang.String is final and therefore Easymock wont mock it for me.p  pSo I created a small wrapper classp  precodeclass StringWrapper      private final String stringValue      public StringWrapperString value          if value  null              throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionCant build StringWrapper from null value                  stringValue  value           Override     public boolean equalsObject o          return stringValue.equalso           Override     public int hashCode          return stringValue.hashCode           Override     public String toString          return stringValue           codepre  pWhen I now run my unit test, that looks likep  precodeTest public void testFeatureBlaCheck    StringWrapper mock  createStrictMockStringWrapper.class   expectmock.equalswhatever.andReturntrue   replaymock   WhatEverClass underTest  new WhatEverClassmock   assertThatunderTest.isFeatureBlaEnabled, istrue   verifymock  codepre  pto testp  precodeclass WhatEverClass    private final StringWrapper stringWrapperInstance     WhatEverClassStringWrapper wrapped      stringWrapperInstance  wrapper    ...  public boolean isFeatureBlaEnabled      return theStringWrapperInstance.equalswhatever  codepre  pBut alas, the unit test fails, and with the mentioned IllegalStateException no last call on mock available. p  pBut equals is not final, so why the errorp  p I fixed it by adding a equalTo method and using that one but I find the usage of my justfortestingwrapper ugly enough but adding such a useless method feels like massive overkill, at least for mep

Negative 4 pI am working with Apache Tika, 1.7, and Apache POI for extracting text from .doc and docx documents in a Mavenbuilt project. For some reason I am getting the p  precodejava.lang.NoSuchMethodError org.apache.poi.util.IOUtils.calculateChecksum codepre  perror. As said in the a hrefhttppoi.apache.orgfaq.htmlfaqN10006 relnofollowApache POI FAQa, this is caused by a version problem. So the obvious solution would be to upgrade POI or something. The problem with this is that I am using the version of POI which is bundled with tika, in the tikaparsers package. This is because I am using the Tika type detector, which is the only part of Tika I am using except for POI. The problem is that, if I use only the tikacore packages and declare the POI dependencies standalone in the maven pom.xml, the Tika detector stops detecting container types, like .docx files, because the tikaparsers package is necessary for the detector, as stated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma222262534052054herea. So, how can I solve this I want to do accurate type detection with tika, but I also want to use Apache POI apart from Tika.p  pThanksp

Negative 4 pI have the following layouts setup I omitted the irrelevant tagsp  precodemain.xml ltinclude     androidididtest1     layoutlayoutmylayout     gt  ltinclude     androidididtest2     layoutlayoutmylayout     gt  mylayout.xml ltLinearLayout     ltEditText         androidididmyedittext     gt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pNote that this particular example is emcruciallyem oversimplified, my actual codemylayout.xmlcode is complex and contains a lot of sublayouts and subviews with a lot of ids and I would emreallyem not like to inline it into codemain.xmlcode.p  pSo, I want to reuse the layout codemylayout.xmlcode multiple times. You might notice that the two EditTexts will have duplicate ids. This seemed not to be a problem since I only use codeR.id.myedittextcode on the activity initialization to find the views with the codetest1code or codetest2code layouts being roots for codefindViewByIdcode, and after that I access these EditTexts via the View objects directly. I find Butterknife very convenient for this, the code looks like thatp  precodeclass LayoutHolder       InjectViewR.id.myedittext      EditText editText       ...      static LayoutHolder createView root           LayoutHolder holder  new LayoutHolder          ButterKnife.injectholder, root          return holder        codepre  pThe problems emerged when I tried to change the screen orientation both EditTexts restored the same state due to these nonunique ids. Ok, I thought, I just have to define some ids in the codevaluescode directory and then use the codeView.setIdcode method on the EditTexts. There are some issues with this approach though in particular, I will have to set these ids manually and programmatically for each and every view with an ID within codemylayout.xmlcode. What is more, even if I do that, I will not be able to access these subviews in some uniform way anymore since they will all have different IDs in particular, I wont be able to do these nice Butterknife injections.p  pIve come up to some other ways of resolving this, but they are even more complex and ugly. So, is there some nice and generic way to accomplish my needs I wonder I wasnt able to find anything on the web, because reusing layouts in order to avoid code duplication xml duplication actually, but whatever seems like quite a natural thing.p
Negative 4 pI am trying to write a parsing program in C that will take certain segments of text from an HTML document. To do this, I need to find every instance of the substring name in the document however, the C function strstr only finds the first instance of a substring. I cannot find a function that finds anything beyond the first instance, and I have considered deleting each substring after I find it so that strstr will return the next one. I cannot get either of these approaches to work. Any suggestions Thanks.p  pBy the way, I know the while loop limits this to six iterations, but I was just testing this to see if I could get the function to work in the first place.p  precode                    whileentrycount lt 6                                                 printftest                         ifptr  strstrbuffer, name  NULL                                                         ptr  8                             int i  0                             whileptr                                                                   companyname[i]  ptr                                 ptr                                 i                                                             companyname[i]  n                             int j                             forj  0 companyname[j]  n j                                 printfc, companyname[j]                             printfn                             strtokbuffer, name                             entrycount                                                     codepre

Negative 4 pI know virtually nothing about SSRS, so forgive me if Im using the wrong vocab.p  pThe group Im working for has a list of volunteer opportunities.  Each opportunity has a specified number of volunteers needed.  The database keeps track of people who have volunteered, for which opportunity they volunteered, and the status of their volunteering whether theyve just signed up and need to be contacted, whether theyre somewhere in the process of becoming a volunteer, whether they emareem volunteering, or whether theyve quit volunteering.p  pCertain volunteer opportunities i.e. those requiring contact with children and therefore requiring a background check, have more volunteer states than the rest of the opportunities.  For these opportunities there are a total of 14 states, compared to 3 or 4 for the rest.p  pI need to create a report that displays the counts of people in each state for each opportunity.  Its unreasonable for there to be 15 columns 14  the volunteers needed for states when most have only three.  For childrenrelated opportunities, I want to specify an other column, and have a expansion [] to the left of the volunteer opportunity name which will expand out all the childrenspecific states with their associated counts.p  pThe report as it is now looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3ThLZ.png altCurrent state of the reportp  pMy background is in databasequery design, so naturally I wrote a query with a joined subquery for each of the columns.  Rather than making an additional new subquery for each of the Other states, I assume theres a way that I can have a single subquery join grouping on the volunteer status, and let SSRS do the rest of the work.  I may be wrong about SSRSs capabilities here.p  pMy proposed query looks something like thisp  precodeSELECT vo.name, vo.volunteersneeded, vm.status, vm.statuscount FROM tblvolunteeropportunity vo JOIN SELECT volunteeroppid, status, COUNT statuscount       FROM tblvolunteeropportunitymember       GROUP BY volunteeroppid, status vm ON vo.volunteeroppid  vm.volunteeropid codepre  pI now need to make a tablix andor datasource to make columns for the codeConnectedcode, codeIn Processcode, codeNo Contactcode, and an aggregate for codeOthercode values, and then do emsomething elseem for a expansion for each of the codeOthercode statuses.p  pIm not sure how to do either of those things.p

Two or three days ago, I encountered a Question regarding arrays in my mind which is give below.p  pEvery Java Programmers knows, Array is a collection of Objects, it doesnt matter whether it contains primitive data types or Strings.p  pSo my Question is, if Array is a collection of Objects so how does it strongtreatsstrong or strongconvertsstrong primitive data type into strongobjectsstrong, because in Java, Primitive Data Type is different from Objectslike Strings. Consider the following programp  precode   int[] Array  new int[3]    Array[0]  1    Array[1]  2    Array[2]  4    forint a0altArray.lengtha System.out.printlnArray[a] codepre  pI made the Array or Array Object using strongnewstrong keyword and strongdatatypestrong follows it. This is, of course, workable for arrays. But when I do something like this for variable, it would get fail.p  precodeint var1  new int 3 codepre  pFor attention, asking again, how does in Java Array strongtreatsstrong or strongconvertsstrong the Primitive Data Type as strongObjectsstrong, since generally Primitive Data Types are strongnotstrong Objects.p  pThank Youp

Negative 4 pIs it OK to have an empty method and have it overridden in its subclasses This is how it would look like in my code.p  precodepublic class Rook       public void voidCastleRight      public class ShortRook extends Rook       Override     public void voidCastleRight          getPlayer.setkSCfalse void King Side Castling Short Castle         public class LongRook extends Rook       Override     public void voidCastleRight          getPlayer.setqSCfalse void Queen Side Castling Long Castle       codepre  pThe context is a chess engine. It is written in Java and it will have to search for the next best move to make given a state of the board. It is therefore important that everything is implemented as efficient as possible because a lot of methods will be called several millions of times. Consequently, I want this hierarchy of Rooks as opposed to one Rook class in which I would have to check on what side the Rook is on and checking if the Rook is on its initial position etc etc..p  pWhen a Board is first created, there will be a ShortRook and a LongRook. While the game progresses, it is possible that more Rooks are introduced into the game because of Pawn promotion. These will be instantiations of Rook.p  pThe method codevoidCastleRightcode will be called whenever a Rook is moved. Rooks that exist because of Pawn promotion shouldnt void the castle right when moved empty method. Rooks that exist since the beginning of the game, should void the castle rights when moved methods in subclasses.p  pI have also written a parser which takes FENStrings and converts them to a Board and vice versa. When the Rooks are not on their initial positions, there is no way to tell which are the Short and LongRook. This isnt a problem because the castle right is voided already anyway and they can be parsed to instantiations of Rook. Therefore would it be OK if I casted a Short or LongRook object to Rook whenever it has voided the relevant castle right i.e. it has moved This way it wont needlessly void the castle right when it is already voided. I dont care about the complexity of these parser methods as they will not be used in search.p  pWhile some might consider these thoughts microoptimizations which are the root of all evil, maybe these optimizations will pay off when the method has to be called a few million times. Im also more concerced about OOP paradigms.p  pPS I know Java isnt the best language to use for this application, it is irrelevant. I am aware that object creation in Java is expensive. I will make sure no objects are created during the search.p

Negative 4 pI had two tables running in 2 different databases but the structure is identical. I want to import data of one table into the other but the id of the rows was autoincrement. This causes ids in both tables to have the same value but their content is different. How do I insert the content of table1 into table 2 and auto update the id to a value that doesnt exist yetp  pBecause the table contains around 1000 rows I cant manually change the numbers or declare each individual row. Something like codeON DUPLICATE id AUTO INCREMENT idcode p

Negative 4 pHeres an example of what Im looking forp  pI have data that comes in as a lifetime total in gallons.

Is it possible to use a MediaBrowser in this way to replicate the functionality that Wear itself is capable of  Unfortunately, ConnectionCallback provides no information whatsoever to help explain why the connection attempt failed.p  precodeMediaBrowser.ConnectionCallback callback  new MediaBrowser.ConnectionCallback              Override             public void onConnected                              super.onConnected                           Override             public void onConnectionFailed                              super.onConnectionFailed                         MediaBrowser mediaBrowser  new MediaBrowserthis, new ComponentNamemain.app.package.name, full.package.name.of.our.mediabrowserservice, callback, null mediaBrowser.connect codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWhen I play audio in our app and the audio notification appears on the watch, I can see our MediaBrowserService start and the package calling onGetRoot is p  blockquote   pcom.google.android.wearable.appp blockquote  pI was assuming this was Wear OS itself but that seems to be the package name for the Android Wear app on the device.  Somehow it is requesting and relaying the data to the watch and perhaps MediaBrowser simply doesnt work from an actual Wear app on the watchp  pI see plenty of examples for using GoogleApiClient to communicate data between watch and phone.  I was hoping to reuse our MediaBrowserService since Wear uses it by default. It seems this is not an option and I must use GoogleApiClient and a WearableListenerService if I want to have the Wear app request data from the handheld app.p

Negative 4 pI am trying to understand the best practice for remote notifications on iOS when the user has a particularly poor network connection or no network connection.p  pThe scenario is suchp  pThe user gets some remote notifications and at some point in the future opens the app. At this point I want to let the server know ASAP that the badge count is now zero. I am using server side badge count management as the only way you can update the icon badge reliably is in the APNS payload. However the call to the server fails as there is no network connectivity. Then the user puts the app into the background so I cant make any further calls to the server if network came back. Subsequently a new remote notification comes in but the badge number is wrong because the server doesnt know it needed to be zeroed. p  pAm I missing something here Any advice gratefully received as I havent found any articles online dealing with this scenario.p

Negative 4 pI have created a number guessing game, where a user chooses a range of numbers to guess from, and when the user inputs a number, the program will respond if they are too high or too low, until the user guesses correctly. The program currently takes the number of attempts, and the time taken into account. There are also different difficulties the higher the difficulty the more numbers to guess from. I have tried to create a scoring system but I need a little more help with the math side. Right now I have this code that generates a scorep  precodedef scorertries, totaltime, difficulty      Tells the user how much time and how many attempts were made     print nCorrect It took you   strroundtotaltime, 2              seconds and   strtries   tries to guess.n       Calculates score, making lower times and fewer      tries yield a higher score      Difmod takes into account the difficulty      Multiply by 1000 to make number more readable     score  1  1  tries  roundtotaltime, 2  1000  difmoddifficulty[1]       Prints the score, rounded to 1 decimal place     print Score   strroundscore, 2 codepre  pcodetriescode and codetotaltimecode are selfexplanatory, and codedifmodcode is a value I made to try to make the score fairer to higher difficulties. The value of codedifmodcode is higher, the higher difficulty there is. As shown here p  precodedef difmoddifficulty     if difficulty  1         return [10, 1]      elif difficulty  2         return [50, 1.5]      elif difficulty  3         return [100, 2]      elif difficulty  4         return [1000, 10]      elif difficulty  5         return [10000, 20]      elif difficulty  0         return [1, 1] codepre  pThe first value in the list is the highest possible number to guess from, the second item in the list is codedifmodcode.

Negative 4 pSuppose I have a resource called codePersoncode.  I can update codePersoncode entities by doing a codePOSTcode to codedataPersonIDcode.  Suppose for simplicity that a person has three properties, first name, last name, and age.p  pcodeGET dataPerson1code yields something likep  pcode id 1, firstName John, lastName Smith, age 30 code.p  pMy question is about updates to this person and the semantics of the services that do this.  Suppose I wanted to update John, hes now 31.  In terms of design approach, Ive seen APIs work two waysp  pstrongOption 1strong p  pcodePOST dataPerson1code with code id 1, age 31 code does the right thing.  Implicitly, any property that isnt mentioned isnt updated.p  pstrongOption 2strong p  pcodePOST dataPerson1code with the full object that would have been received by codeGETcode  all properties must be specified, even if many dont change, because the API in the presence of a missing property would assume that its proper value is codenullcode.p  pWhich option is correct from a recommended design perspective   Option 1 is attractive because its short and simple, but has the downside of being ambiguous in some cases.  Option 2 has you sending a lot of data back and forth even if its not changing, and doesnt tell the server whats really important about this payload only the age changed. p

Yes ofcourse the timeout will happen and the script will be exited. But I do not want that to happen and script to be continued to execute the next command say CMD1. So instead of raising the exception upon timeout, I have overridden the code to execute next command. But what really happens is, the next send is executed only after the 60 seconds. So I am getting wrong outputs in the next expect. Can anyone tell me how can I interrupt the send such a way that the consecutive commands excute in right wayp

Negative 4 pI have a Linux server and a java application. I am using Java 1.7 to run this application. I want to enable JMX for monitoring purposes. The JMX connection should be secured by SSL. So far so easy.p  pMy problem How do I tell the jvm the keystorepassword in a secure way So far the ssl connection only works if I pass the password over the command line parameter Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePasswordmypwd. It seems that the password must be set on initialising of the jvm.p  pIf I am looking at the process list ps ef on the console I can see my java process  but with all the command line parameters. So my keystore password is listed in plain text for everyone who can list the active processes eg over a snmp agent. How can I hide the password from the process listp  pI have tried to use a config file com.sun.management.config.file. It works well for all jmx specific parameters. But my password is ignored.p  pIs providing the password in a command line parameter in plain text realy the only wayp  pYes  I know that Java 1.7 ist out of service. If Java 1.8 actualy fixes this problem I will change immediatly.p  pThanks for helpp
