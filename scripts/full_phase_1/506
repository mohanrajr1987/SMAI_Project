Positive 506 pI am trying to compute the object oriented bounding box for a set of points. Im using c and the Eigen linear algebra library.p  pI have been using two blog posts as guides yet still my bounding boxes are incorrect see images.p  pa hrefhttpshewjunwei.wordpress.com20130126obbgenerationviaprincipalcomponentanalysis relnofollowblog post 1a a hrefhttpjamesgregson.blogspot.co.uk201103latextest.html relnofollowblog post 2ap  pI hope my commented code is clear of my attempt but the gist of the algorithm is to use PCA to find the basis vectors for the object oriented coordinate frame.p  pTo then project all points into the new frame, find the min and max points that define the box, then project these point into the original coordinate frame and render them.p  pI can successfully render a box but is isnt a bounding box and appears to be aligned to the normal x,y,z axis. This is clear in the first image for each of the two objects shown.p  pAny help would be really appreciated.

Positive 506 pCan I create a virtually infinite number of instances of a class Or can you tell me a better way to do thisp  pHeres my problem, I want to make a program that lets you create circles by clicking on the screen, they have to be displayed and to interact with one another. Im pretty newbie, so I divided my project in some phasesp  p1 Display the formbr 2 Display circles on click with diameter and color chosen by the userbr 3 Make a separate class for single circlesbr 4 Make them movebr 5 Make them interact with one anotherbr 6 Check for bugs etc.p  pIm stuck between point 2 and 3. Im not sure that making a codeCirclecode class and creating various instances is the smartest way to do this, but its the only way I came up with that gave me the possibility to make infinite circles displayed. I could use an array, since I think no one will ever use more than 20 circles at a time. Whats more, I dont even think Ill ever publish this, since Im making this just to learn something of graphics. so, sooner or later, Ill need help with point 4.p

Positive 506 pIll use a Rubiks cube as an example to illustrate my question. Lets say I have decided to put my 3x3x3 array of cubes centered around x1,y1,z1, instead of the origin.

Positive 506 pSo, I have written my first application in C using VS 2008. It is a  winforms UI that launches a Fortran program to do a lot of number  crunching. p  pThe Fortran program requires iteration and attempts to converge  to a solution. Convergence is not guaranteed, and the user can observe the  progress of the iteration via graphical presentations in the UI, developed  from data passed from the Fortran program in the form of text files. p  pAfter each iteration, the data in the files are inspected, the graphical  representation is updated, and each of the affected controls on the form is  individually updated with a call to, for example, thisControl.Refresh. If  progress is not acceptable, the UI provides controls for interacting with  or terminating the Fortran code. p  pThis all works well except for one annoying problem. The border of the form  showing the graphics flickers i.e., temporarily changes from theme color to white and back to theme  color with each iteration, which occurs very 12 seconds can be longer or  shorter depending on the problem being solved. Furthermore, if you change  focus to another form, the border of that form begins to flicker in the  same manner. p  pIf you minimize the original form, no flickering is observed,  but that defeats the purpose of that form. I have implemented double  buffering for the form, the form is not resizable, and no dragging of  graphics is performed. p  pI have checked several forums for a solution to my problem, but could not find anything related to my problem. Any ideas of how to eliminate the flickering would  be greatly appreciated.p

Positive 506 pWhat is the best way to determine if a point is on a polygon edge We now use a distance between the point and its closest polygon edge but estimating a distance limit for all polygon cases is really a puzzle.p  pAny idea is welcome.p  pThanks.p
Positive 506 pIs there a way in three.js to project an object in my case, a line geometry ellipse which shows the orbit of a spacecraft onto another 3D object the earth p  pI would assume there is, because this is how shadows are done in most graphics libraries, but most of what Ive found is only projecting onto a flat surface like in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32153295howtoprojecta3dobjectontoa2dplaneinthreejsposta. p
Positive 506 pHow can I simulate photoshops color blend mode without conversion RGB to HSL and back Im using GLSL. In my fragment shader there are two texture units, one for the background image and another for the foreground image. Each image is in RGB color space, of course. As I understand correctly, I should to convert each image in HSL and take luminance from the background but hue and saturation from the foreground. In this case I need to convert each image to HSL, do necessary calculations and convert result back to RGB. Is there alternative way p

Positive 506 pSo I am fairly new to java and I am working on a graphical user interface for a simple game of minesweeper. Originally I had all my code integrated into one class and instantiated my Panel and Frame in the same class, but my professor insisted I place my Frame and Panel in separate classes. I am now stuck on how to implement my panel in my frame. I attempted creating an instance of the class in my main method, but when I ran my program it just displayed an empty frame. Before I set up separate classes my code ran perfectly but now my panel is not being added to my frame.

While this might not seem like a huge concern, it means that these graphs are not immediately exportable.p  pHow can I move the label Iterations to the bottom of the graph, next to its axis p  pThe answer currently offered below allows for manual image modification within Tableau, which is unsatisfactory. It seems bizarre to me that the default, unchangeable behavior of Tableau goes against standard practice in graphing labels next to labelled. p

Positive 506 pIm working on trying to create a key for a heatmap, but as far as I know, I cannot use the existing tools for adding a legend since Ive generated the colors myself I manually turn a scaled variable into rgb values for a short rainbow  [255,0,0] to [0,0,255] .p  pBasically, all I want to do is use the rightmost 10th of the screen to create a rectangle with these 10 colors 0000FF, 0072FF, 00E3FF, 00FFAA, 00FF38, 39FF00, AAFF00, FFE200, FF7100, FF0000p  pwith three numerical labels  at 0, max2, and max p  pIn essence, I want to manually produce an object that looks like a rudimentary heatmap color key.p  pAs far as I know, split.screen can only split the screen in half, which isnt what Im looking for. I want the graphic I already know how to produce to take up the leftmost 90 of the screen, and I want this colored rectangle to take up the other 10. p  pThanks.p  pEDIT I greatly appreciate the advice about the best way to the the plot  that said, I still would like to know the best way to do the task originally asked  creating the legend by hand I already am able to produce the exact heatmap graphic that Im looking for  the false coloring wasnt the only problem with ggplot that I was having  it was just the final factor convincing me to switch. I need a non ggplot solution.p  pEDIT 2 This is close to the solution I am looking for, except this only goes up to 10 instead of accepting a maximum value as a parameter I will be running this code on multiple datasets, all with different maximum values  I want the legend to reflect this. Additionally, if I change the size of the graph, the key falls apart into disconnected squares. p

What Im trying to do is that if the user moves a state A and it overlaps another one B, then A might not change its position.p  pAt first I thought that I had to validate if the distance between the new location of A and the center of any other state doesnt exceed a certain value, then it could be moved.

However when I move the mouse to different position in a zoomed state e.g. zoom factor is 2 and scroll, the image jumpes once to a different position than the mouse is and after this jump everything works well again. p  pCan anyone explain this behaviourp

Negative 506 pI am looking for options to get our vast collection of DB objects across many DBs into source control TFS 2010. Once we succeed here, we will work toward generating our alter scripts for a particular DB change via TFS build.p  pThe problem is, our data architecture group is responsible for maintaining the DB objects excluding SPs, and they work within a model centric process, via ERWin. What this means, is that they maintain the DBs via ERWin models, and generate alters from them that are used to release changes.p  pIn order to achieve our goal of getting the DB objects not just the ERWin models into TFS, I believe the best option is to do this via Visual Studio DB projects.

I have to represent these four separate concepts, but am unsure if my current plan is a good onep  ul liAppointmentsli liLine Itemsli liInvoicesli liPaymentsli ul  pstrongAppointmentstrong An Appointment is a place and time where employees are expected to be in order to deliver a service.p  pstrongLine Itemstrong A Line Item is a service, fee or discount and its associated information.  An example of line items that might go into an appointmentp  pre Name                          Price Commission Time estimate    Full Detail, Regular Size        160       75       3.5 hours  10 Off Full Detail Coupon       10        0         0 hours  Premium Detail                   220      110       4.5 hours  Derived totalsnot a line item 370     185       8.0 hours pre  pstrongInvoicestrong An Invoice is a record of one or more line items that a customer has committed to pay for.p  pstrongPaymentstrong A Payment is a record of what payments have come in.p  pIn a previous implementation of this application, life was simpler and I treated all four of these concepts as one table in a SQL database Appointment.  One Appointment could have multiple line items, multiple payments, and one invoice.  The invoice was just an email or print out that was produced from the line items and customer record.p  p9 out of 10 times, this worked fine.  When one customer made one appointment for one or a few vehicles and paid for it themselves, all was grand.  But this system didnt work under a lot of conditions.  For examplep  ul liWhen one customer made one appointment, but the appointment got rained out halfway through resulting in the detailer had to come back the next day, I needed two appointments, but only one line item, one invoice and one payment.li liWhen a group of customers at an office all decided to have their cars done the same day in order to get a discount, I needed one appointment, but multiple invoices and multiple payments.li liWhen one customer paid for two appointments with one check, I needed two appointments, but only one invoice and one payment.li ul  pI was able to handle all of these outliers by fudging things a little.  For example, if a detailer had to come back the next day, id just make another appointment on the second day with a line item that said Finish Up and the cost would be 0.  Or if I had one customer pay for two appointments with one check, Id put split payment records in each appointment.  The problem with this is that it creates a huge opportunity for data incongruency.  Data incongruency can be a serious problem especially for cases involving financial information such as the third exmaple where the customer paid for two appointments with one check. Payments must be matched up directly with goods and services rendered in order to properly keep track of accounts receivable.p  h2Proposed structureh2  pBelow, is a normalized structure for organizing and storing this data.  Perhaps because of my inexperience, I place a lot of emphasis on data normalization because it seems like a great way to avoid data incongruity errors.  With this structure, changes to the data can be done with one operation without having to worry about updating other tables.  Reads, however, can require multiple reads coupled with inmemory organization of data.  I figure later on, if there are performance issues, I can add some denormalized fields to Appointment for faster querying while keeping the safe normalized structure intact.  Denormalization could potentially slow down writes, but I was thinking that I might be able to make asynchronous calls to other resources or add to the task que so that the client does not have to wait for the extra writes that update the denormalized portions of the data.p  pstrongTablesstrongp  precodeAppointment  starttime  etc...

This would include information on what services were scheduled for each appointment, the total cost of each appointment and weather or not payment as been received for each appointment.

Negative 506 pIf I have a function emfem that computes element emmem of a sequence of digits in base embem, is it in general possible to write a function emgem that computes element emnem of the corresponding sequence in base emcem p  pAs a contrived example, say emfem produces binary and emgem produces hexadecimalp  pre ifiimi rarr 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... igiini rarr A, A, ... pre  pNow say emfem is in base 5 and emgem is in base 6. The bases dont share a common factor, which means that the number of digits required to represent a number from the source base in the target base is fractional sup6supfraslsub5sub. Is it possible to determine a single digit from emgem using only, say, the corresponding supemcemsupfraslsubembemsub digits from emfem p  pNote that starting the formula at the first element is the same as performing the standard conversion of a fractional number from embem to emcem, but I want an arbitrary element of the target sequence, in the same way that I can retrieve an arbitrary element of the source.p
Negative 506 pLets imagine that we have blog with category codeAcode. Category codeAcode is currently having 1000 posts on 100 pages. All pages are cached in files for example, cached by Smarty template engine. Im adding post and want it to be displayed on first page immediately. So, I have to clear or invalidate cache for all 100 pages of category A.p  pDeleting cached pages is not a good idea because we can have too much files for example, thousands of pages. I think that invalidating cache and regenerating page on request is much more efficient way.p  pMy only thought is to add codenumber of posts in categorycode to cache id. So, first we should get number of posts in category for example, from memcache and then check if cached version valid by this number. p  pEverything looks fine and simple. But lets imagine situation when Im adding new post and then after 1 minute Im removing another older post. Number of posts still 1000 and some category pages will stay old if they were not viewed during this 1 minute.p  pWhat is the solutionp  pPS Sorry for my English, but I think that my question will be clear from people who have already faced such problem.p  pThank youp

Negative 506 pI am currently trying to implement basic speech recognition in AS3. I need this to be completely client side, as such I cant access powerful serverside speech recognition tools. The idea I had was to detect syllables in a word, and use that to determine the word spoken. I am aware that this will grealty limit the capacities for recognition, but I only need to recognize a few key words and I can make sure they all have a different number of syllables.p  pI am currently able to generate a 1D array of voice level for a spoken word, and I can clearly see, if I somehow draw it, that there are distinct peaks for the syllables in most of the cases. However, I am completely stuck as to how I would find out those peaks. I only really need the count, but I suppose that comes with finding them. At first I thought of grabbing a few maximum values and comparing them with the average of values but I had forgot about that peak that is bigger than the others and as such, all my peaks were located on one actual peak.p  pI stumbled onto a hrefhttpbillauer.co.ilpeakdet.htmlsome Matlab codea that looks almost too short to be true, but I cant very that as I am unable to convert it to any language I know. I tried AS3 and C. So I am wondering if you guys could start me on the right path or had any pseudocode for peak detectionp

Negative 506 pAt first my code set up the SDL environment, and proceeded to update the OpenGL context, without performing any SDLEvent processing whatsoever. This causes the window, as long as it was open, to appear to Windows to be unresponsive. The window flickers a bit. The titlebar would get Not Responding appended to it, and upon clicking inside the window it becomes grayed out, as Windows does this by default on non responsive windows. However in this state even as and after it becomes grayed out, the OpenGL display continues to update and animate, and heres the kicker, it even does so emwhile the window is being draggedem. Clearly in this case the application isnt handling events from windows correctly, causing windows to think that it is in a hanged state. But there is clear evidence that the opengl continues to render. p  pNow I make one single modification to the code, which is these three lines placed in an appropriate spot inside the loop which also does the OpenGL draw p  precodeSDLEvent event if SDLPollEventampevent ampamp event.type  SDLQUIT     break codepre  pAll this is doing is flushing the message queue using SDL. p  pNow the behavior is that Windows no longer thinks it is Not Responding and it does not get grayed out. No flicker. Everything seems to run swimmingly. But once I click and drag the title bar to drag the window, rendering gets blocked. I havent debugged it to be sure, but I suspect that SDLPollEvent blocks for the duration of the window drag. p  pIs there a way around this This is interesting because part of the behavior exhibited by emfailing to handle eventsem is proof that what I want is possible in theory.p  pUpdate I found this thread a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.nettopic488074win32messagepumpandopenglrenderingpauseswhiledraggingresizinghttpwww.gamedev.nettopic488074win32messagepumpandopenglrenderingpauseswhiledraggingresizingap  pThe verdict seems to be that it comes down to certain choices that Microsoft made for us... It basically gets stuck in codeDefWindowProccode till the mouse is released. It would get very messy to hack a fix for this and I might be able to do a work around by rendering in another thread. But I dont even want to begin to think about juggling an OpenGL context from multiple threads, if thats even something thats possible.p

Negative 506 pIm puzzling over a technical dilemma where two folks on our team a recommending two different security models each with pros and cons.p  pThe greenfield looks like this We have a an asp.net web app, talking to a business layer, talking to a database.p  pOne of the requirements is to be able to have higher level users delegate business layer rights to other users.p  pOne of the folks is lobbying for the capability of an internet user to pass their credentials all the way down into the database so the connection can use an actual sqlserver account for querying, etc. Some aspects of this I like  auditing capabilities for instancep  pThe alternate approach on hand is to simply go with suite of users,passwords,roles,resources tables in the database, and manage the security up in the business layer.p  pIt could be because I come from a java to oracle background where in most cases you use a connection pool that provides connections which were already authenticated using a service type account.  Our internet clientele never had emactual database accountsem.p  pAm I flawed in my thinking that managing delegatable security by internet users inside the builtin, internal credentials store that mssql server provides seems fraught with peril security wisep  pAny one have any recommendationsp

Negative 506 pI currently have an app where I do a lot of image manipulation. I basically take an image that is 320x320 emor 640x640 on Retinaem and scale it down to 128x128 emor 256x256 on Retinaem before rounding off its corners and applying a glossy highlight. Everything is done using Core Graphics drawing.p  pAt any one time there could be around 600 images that need this processing so I do around 40 on app launch using a background thread and cache them into a FIFO queue. When an image not in the cache needs processing, I do so and add it to the end of the cache, discarding the first cached image. If that first image is needed again it goes through the same process.p  pWhat I would like to know is if it would make more sense, and is ultimately more efficient, to save the discarded images to disk rather than recreate them from scratch the next time they are needed, as I could instead just read them from disk.p  pThese images are also displayed using a codeCALayercode and therefore there may be a overhead when the layers contents are set because of the conversion from codeUIImagecode to codeCGImagecode. If I store them on disk I believe they can be read directly as a codeCGImagecodep  pAny ideas and input on improving the efficiency of this process will be sincerely welcomed.p

Negative 506 pIm working through Learning Python 4th Edition and Im currently working on the exercises for part VI of the book. The exercise Im currently on is kind of confusing me and I was hoping I could get a little guidance as to how I can solve it.p  pHeres the prompt Im working with.p  blockquote   pSubclassing. Make a subclass of MyList from exercise 2 called MyListSub, which extends MyList to print a message to stdout before each overloaded operation is called and counts the number of calls. MyListSub should inherit basic method behavior from MyList. Adding a sequence to a MyListSub should print a message, increment the counter for  calls, and perform the superclasss method. Also, introduce a new method that prints the operation counters to stdout, and experiment with your class interactively. Do your counters count calls per instance, or per class for all instances of the class How would you program the other option Hint it depends on which object the count members are assigned to class members are shared by instances, but self members are perinstance data.p blockquote  pSo the part Im really interested in right now is the p  blockquote   pMake a subclass of MyList from exercise 2 called MyListSub, which extends MyList to print a message to stdout before each overloaded operation is called and counts the number of calls.p blockquote  pI can see a good use of DRY right here thatll kill all my birds with one stone. But I just dont know how to implement it. I know that what I should do is implement some kind of method that intercepts operations, increments a counter and prints a message. But I dont know how to best go about that. My basic idea is something like p  precodedef countopsself, opcount      intercept calls to operator overloading methods     opcount  1     print Number of calls to operator 0 1.formatoper, opcount codepre  pNote This isnt code Ive written yet, this is borderline pseudocode to highlight what I want to do.p  pCan I get a little help here Please dont give me the answer outright I want to figure this out and hints go much further than answers. p

Negative 506 pSo I have a page, it had multiple textboxes, linkbuttons, and buttons.  Currently, a user clicks a linkbutton Edit which allows them to enter data in that row, via textboxes.  However, upon pressing enter, the event for one of the buttons fired...this is not desired at all.  Apparently, this is the default behavior built in  p  pIs it possible to associate each textbox so that pressing enter will act on a specific assigned linkbutton or button, without the textboxes being in separate formsp  pIf this is not possible, Im going to try and create a button and make it the default form button, but disable and hide it, so that pressing enter submits nothing.p  pThanksp

Negative 506 pI am running some automation in a C program .Net 4.0.  There is an issue with a modal dialog where I want to click the message away and continue testing.  I have tried a few options SendKey and using Win32 to send a click event with code modified from here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinegg309183.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinegg309183.aspxa.  Neither of these have proved to be reliable enough to be considered effective.p  pMy next approach will be to try calling the EndDialog function from my C program and simply sending the enumerationreturn code to the message box.  p  pEndDialogHWND hDlg, INTPTR nResult is the call where hDlg is the handle to the message box being closed and nResult is the result of the dialog.p  pWhere I am running into an issue is how to send the desired result.  An example would be that the return code IDCANCEL has a value of 2.  How exactly do I send this value  What variables or constants would I need to declare  Im just looking for how to get the proper pointer declared to send the desired result to the function.p  pFurther information on these result values can be found here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64550528vVS.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms645505vVS.85.aspxap
Negative 506 pI need to test if my application is reading special characters from the database and displaying them in exactly the same way. For this, I need to populate the database table with all special characters available. However, I am not sure how I can specify the special characters in the sql insert query. Can anyone please guide me to an example where I can insert a special character in the query For simplicity sake, suppose the table is a City table with Area and AvgTemperature being the 2 columns. If I need to insert the degree celciusfarhenheit symbol in AvgTemperature column, how should I write the query p  hr  pem[Edit on 192012 at 250PM EST]emAs per Justin Caves suggestion below, I did

Then drag the existing view as a subview of the new view. When youre done, it should look like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFa5m7.jpg altenter image description herep  pNow my problem is when I add this new view the sub view to my current view, it does not expand into a hierarchy as shown in the picture until I select everything images, labels, etc etc and manually drag it into this new subview. This works BUT my positioning of labels, images etc etc has been lost. Everything is literally in the centre of the subview stacked on top of each other. I realize this tutorial was done in xcode 3 but is there something I can do to maintain position of my objects I have many objects in the view and it would be such a pain to relocate them all again.p  pThank you so muchp

This is what I would like...p  precode Criteria 1 Lazy evaluation of expressions int x  LazyEvaluated.Newltintgt int y  LazyEvaluated.Newltintgt int z  LazyEvaluated.Newltintgt  z.Assignx  y Assert.ThrowsExceptionz.Evalutate x.Assign1 Assert.ThrowsExceptionz.Evalutate y.Assign2 Assert.Equals3, z.Evaluate x.Assign3 Assert.Equals5, z.Evaluate   Criteria 2 Referencing relative to parent object     Car myCar  LazyEvaluated.NewltCargt Engine engineInMyCar  LazyEvaluated.NewltEnginegt double displacementOfMyEngine  LazyEvaluated.Newltdoublegt  engineInMyCar  myCar.Engine displacementOfMyEngine  engineInMyCar.Displacement  Car subaru  new Carnew FlatFourEngine Car falcon  new Carnew InlineSixEngine  myCar.Assignsubaru Assert.IsTypeOfltFlatFourEnginegtengineInMyCar.Evaluate Assert.IsEqual2.0, displacementOfMyEngine.Evaluate  myCar.Assignfalcon Assert.IsTypeOfltInlineSixEnginegtengineInMyCar.Evaluate Assert.IsEqual4.0, displacementOfMyEngine.Evaluate codepre  pAnd these are the simple class definitions that I have used for illustration...p  precodepublic class Car      private readonly Engine engine                 public CarEngine engine  this.engine  engine      public Engine Engine  get  return engine     public abstract class Engine      public abstract double Displacement  get            public class FlatFourEngine  Engine      public override double Displacement  get  return 2.0     public class InlineSixEngine  Engine      public override double Displacement  get  return 4.0        codepre  pThe reason I want this functionality is mostly for separationofconcerns. To illustrate, lets take the car analogue a bit further. My car is made up of lots of bits engine, tyres, interior etc. My tyres need to be changed every 2 years by a tyre shop. My engine needs to have an oil change every 6 months by a mechanic. The interior needs to be vacuumed every 3 months by a detailer. It would be nice to able to do something along the lines of...p  precodetyreShop.ReplaceTyresmyCar.Tyres, every2Years mechanic.ChangeOilmyCar.Engine, every6Months detailer.VacuumInteriormyCar.Interior, every3Months codepre  pSome reasons for this approachp  ul liI would like to setandforget. Once I schedule a part of my car in for a service, I want it to happen on an ongoing basis without any further input from me.li liI dont want to have to call each of my service centres and notify them the instant that I purchase a new car. In fact, they dont need to know that I have a new car until it comes time for a service. If they try to service my car and it doesnt exist, then its ok for them to throw an exception.li liI want each of my services to be as simple and focussed as possible. Why give the tyre shop a reference to my entire car including engine, interior, etc, when the only thing they really care about is the tyresli liI dont want the tyreshop to give me a new set of tyres and force me to fit assign them to the car myself.li ul  pI do not have any formal education in CS, and my only programming experience is with c amp c languages. Ive just spent the last 6 months getting familiar with c amp .Net. For the most part, I really like the language and earlyevaluation in general. But I am now questioning whether I would have been better off tackling my particular problem in a different language with inbuilt support for lazy evaluation.p  pMy questions arep  ol liIf I were to start again, what would be the best language to tackle such a problem inli liAre there any existing platforms for c that provide support for lazy evaluationli liWhat are the alternatives for making this work in c Are there any particular design patterns I should read up onli ol

Negative 506 pI have just started working with OpenCL. However, I have found some weird behavior of OpenCl, which i cant understand. The source i built and tested, was a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles110685Part1OpenCLPortableParallelism relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles110685Part1OpenCLPortableParallelisma . I have a ATI Radeon HD 4770, and a AMD Fx 6200 3.8 ghz 6 core cpu. p  h2Speedh2  pFirstly the speed is not linearly to the number of maximum work group items. I ran App profiler to analyze the time spent during the kernel execution. The result was a bit shocking, my GPU which can only handle 256 work items per group, used 2.23008 milliseconds to calculate square of 5079040 numbers. Note this was without considering the kernel loading time...p  pHowever, my cpu which can handle 1024 work items per group, used 13.41895 milliseconds to calculate the numbers. I thought that the work items in a work group are ran simultaneously, in other words the cpu should have been faster. What i want to know, do work group run simultaneously Like, in my setup, the GPU would run more work groups simultaneously than the CPU. p  pAnother factor may be that the GPU is faster to calculate float arithmetics, but my cpu have 4 times faster clock speed, so still weird.  I know that normally the GPU should be faster when it yields to opencl, but i want a good explanation for why.p  pEdit I tried to calculate 1024, 2048...5120 work items, and now the cpu was faster than the GPU. So i have learned that the CPU works better with few work times, while the GPU is best when it is many work items. p  pWhat i also saw, was that my CPU did the calculation much slower for every third times the work group size4096, 6144, 8192. So it looks like my CPU takes three work groups simultaneously. p  h2Floating point precisionh2  pQuestion moved here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11176990openclfloatingpointprecisionOpenCL Floating point precisionap  pThanks in advance for all answers.p

Negative 506 pIve been using Akka and Scala for about a month and Im somewhat bothered by replacing explicit interfaces with messages. Consider the following simple Akka Actorp  precodecase class DoMyHomework class Parent extends Actor    def receive       case d DoMyHomework gt  do nothing     codepre  pActor or nonactor code that sends this actor a DoMyHomework message like thisp  precodeActorRef parent  ... parent.askDoMyHomework codepre  pHas no idea what the outcome will be.  Whats the type of the answer Will I ever get an answer Can I get an exception And so on.p  pThe fix seems to be to document the case class... but what if some other actor also receives that same case class. Then the documentation should for receiving that message should be in the actor itself.p  pIn an effort to clean this up a little I thought of doing the followingp  precodetrait SomeoneSmarter    def wouldYouDoMyHomework Future[Boolean]   class Parent extends Actor with SomeoneSmarter    case class DoMyHomework   def wouldYouDoMyHomework       self  DoMyHomework.mapToBoolean      def receive       case d DoMyHomework gt        TODO If Im busy schedule a false No way reply for a few seconds from now.        Just to keep their hopes up for a while. Otherwise, say sure right away.     codepre  pSo, I chatted with colleagues about this and one of the reactions was youre not being true to the actor model.p  pFirst, I would really appreciate some guidance from folks that have been using Actors for a longer time. Do all the messages become unwieldy Do you end up hiding messagepassing behind interfaces p  pThe actors Im proposing still have the option of sending messages among themselves, subscribing to event streams, all the stuff you expect from Akka. And the interface gives you a timetested way of knowing what youre talking to. And it helps when coding in IDEs, and so on. And why should the user of an actor need to know its an actor unless its also an actor and is very tightly coupled with itp  pThe other reaction I got was it looks like you want a TypedActor. But after reading about TypedActor Im not convinced. Certainly TypedActor saves me the trouble of creating those internal messages. But, at least from the code sample at a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkasnapshotscalatypedactors.htmlhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkasnapshotscalatypedactors.htmla I get the impression that the TypedActor is meant only to work as a proxy around a block of code you want to encapsulate, or make threadsafe, or simply not call directly from your current thread. And what you code is just the implementation and interface. You dont mess with the actor itself the proxy  e.g. if you want your implementation to do periodic work or subscribe to an event stream, or do anything else unrelated to the interface.p  pIve also read a hrefhttpletitcrash.compost19074284309whentousetypedactorshttpletitcrash.compost19074284309whentousetypedactorsa and didnt find that example more illuminating. Im probably just not grokking TypedActor not that I claim to have really understood Actors yet.p  pthanks in advance for help.p  pPinop
Negative 506 pI have an application that has two fragments as actionbar tabs.  The fragments are attacheddetached when switching between the tabs.  Any time I switch a tab, change the orientation, or press back to exit the application, the view is destroyed.  I need it to be restored to its previous state when it is reopened.  I know, at least on the orientation change, to use onSaveInstanceState and save the data there so I can restore it when the view is recreated.  However, for some reason even though the data gets saved properly to the outState bundle and is read properly from the savedInstanceState bundle, the view doesnt update to what it should update to.  For example, I start a service and while that service is running I need to hide two buttons and show two other buttons in their place.  I use a boolean to check if the service is running, then put it in the outState so I can see which buttons to show or hide.  My code for that isp  precodeOverride public void onSaveInstanceStateBundle outState      super.onSaveInstanceStateoutState     outState.putBooleanisRunning, isRunning  codepre  pIn onCreateViewp  precodeif savedInstanceState  null          isRunning  savedInstanceState.getBooleanisRunning, false         if isRunning              showStopButton           codepre  pAnd the showStopButton code isp  precodeprivate void showStopButton      btnStart.setVisibilityView.GONE     btnReset.setVisibilityView.GONE     btnStop.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE     btnLoop.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE  codepre  pSo all this works, the boolean is found as true while the service is running, and showStopButton is called.  However, it doesnt appear to actually do anything.  The view state just resets itself to as if the first two buttons which I want to be hidden are shown instead of the ones I actually want to be shown.  Any idea why this is happeninghow to fix it  p  pI also have a listview that I need to stay populated with the same values as before that I cant get to work either.  p  pAlso, onSaveInstanceState isnt called when switching tabs and I think not when pressing the back button either.  How should I go about retaining the view state in these cases  p

Negative 506 pI am adding some test coverage to some existing code. There are about 20 classesall derivatives of the same base classwhich would result in very similar and repetitive test methods. Instead, what Im trying to do is crate a abstract test class which exposes some abstract methods for handling the unique details of the derived class under test.p  pThis was working well until I came to testing the ToString override. Basically, the test method which youll recall lives in an abstract base class is asserting the equality of an expected string value and the result of the ToString method executed on an instance of my generic type as provided by on the afore mentioned abstract methods. However, rather than calling the ToString override, as I was expecting, the standard object implementation is invoked instead, returning the fullyqualified name of the object. p  pSo, the question how can I call the ToString override of a class when dealing with a generically typed instance p  pI expect this question can be answered with a better understanding of the fundamentals of generic types so, in the interest of brevity, Im not posting any code. If Ive underestimated the situation, please let me know and Ill add the relevant code.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT  CODE p  precodepublic abstract class KeyTestsBaseltTKey, TKeyInterfacegt      where

Negative 506 pI have a template where I need to embed some CSS from a model within a style tag, like thisp  precodeltstylegtm.getcsstextltstylegt codepre  pin case it matters, m is actually a forin varp  pThis works without a problem except for one glitch which only happens in IE. I have a rule in the CSS includes a filter rule, which uses quotes, like this p  precodefilter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradientstartColorstrffffff, endColorstrf5f5f5 important codepre  pThe default escaping behavior of django escapes the quotes, and this breaks the CSS rule, which mucks up the CSS in IE, where the rule applies.p  pUsing the safe filter solves this problem, of course, but I would rather not use it. For now the model holding the CSS is only editable by my staff, but in the future this could be created by our users.p  pMy question is this  what filters should I use to prevent escaping of quotes etc. but to keep the tag safe My only idea so far is to use the removetags filter, but Im not sure its the best idea.p  pThanksp

Negative 506 pI am working on a largescale system for a telecom company. I am new to DDD and having hard time linking different pieces together. Our current system is build using NHibernate. It currently has well over 600 tables and all data access is done using NHibernate but for the new system we will be using EF. Below are few functional areas and examples of database tables in each functional area.p  pCustomersbr      CustomerDemographicsbr      CustomerPaymentsbr      CustomerTransactions  p  pRoutingEnginebr      InboundRoutesbr      OutboundRoutes  p  pProvisioningEnginebr      InboundSwithcesbr      OutboundSwitchesbr      RouterConfigsbr      GatewayConfigs  p  pBillingEnginebr      InboundTrafficbr      OutboundTraffic  p  pSince the system has to be unittestable, I started abstracting actual entities with a repository pattern. One approach is to create one repository object for each  each database table. Of course all these repository classes could be  derived from a generic repository interface. However this will be adding quite a bit of overhead in terms of code base maintenance. In DDD, I read about this concept of Aggregates but I am not sure how it should be applied specially in context of EF. Should the Aggregate objects are container of these repositories or are these more of a container of related contexts meaning something along the lines of Bounded DbContextsp

Negative 506 pMy setup is as follows A custom page on a Sharepoint 2010 site with a list view web part and a Data view web part.

I will log and describe the error below.p  precodevar http  requirehttp var options       host www.reddit.com,     path    module.exports  functionusername       console.logusername      options.path  user  username  .json      var userData      http.getoptions, functionres            res.ondata, functiondata              userData  data             console.loguserData                   res.onend, function              userData  JSON.parseuserData             console.loguserData                codepre  pAs for the error, it happens when the program gets to the point where it needs to run JSON.parse.  I know this because i can see it output the raw JSON from when i log the result on the data event.  Then this error is output...p  precodeundefined1 undefinedkind Listing, data modhash , children [kind t1  SyntaxError Unexpected token u     at Object.parse native     at IncomingMessage.module.exports homestephenDesktopkarmacrawlerenginecrawlUser.js2320     at IncomingMessage.EventEmitter.emit events.js12620     at IncomingMessage.emitEnd http.js36610     at HTTPParser.parserOnMessageComplete [as onMessageComplete] http.js14923     at Socket.socketOnData [as ondata] http.js136720     at TCP.onread net.js40327 codepre
Negative 506 pIm trying to make my own simple framework in PHP.

Negative 506 pIve been tasked with researching data layer underpinnings for a new reporting system and have spent a lot of time evaluating ORMs over the last few days.

At first, I was thinking about using the greedy algorithm, that is, choosing the highest value in r1, and recursing through comparing the next 3 possibilities choosing the highest of the 3. However, the downfall is that the greedy algorithm doesnt have the ability to see potential ahead of the next row. p  pHow would I go about this Im not looking for code per se, since I enjoy solving things on my own. However, pseudocode or some algorithmic guidance would be much appreciatedp

I finally figured out that, during the installation for my app, I could run a custom action with an elevated process EXE application manifest set to requireAdministrator if I set its InScript Execution property to Deferred Execution In System Context.p  pThats nice.p  pBut now I must be able to do exactly the same thing during the uninstall. So far, even on the paid version of InstallShield 2012 Spring Express, I cant get it to work.p  pFirst of all, for the Custom Actions During Uninstallation section, there are only two entries, Before System Changes and After System Changes.p  pI didnt try adding my custom action to After System Changes, because the EXE that I need to run is part of my package and thus would have been removed by then. And so I added it to Before System Changes. Now for some reason, when I add it to Before System Changes, there is no InScript Execution option. And because I dont have this option, when my uninstall attempts to run the elevated process EXE, it fails with an error 1721...which is exactly the same error I used to get during the installation, until I changed the InScript Execution option to Deferred Execution In System Context.p  pSo, how can I get my elevated process EXE to run correctly during the uninstall Is InstallShield incapable of properly handling thisp  pThanks, JPp

Negative 506 pI have an image that can be stretched in the horizontal direction, but need to be tiled vertically one on top of the other to fill my view. How could I do thisp  pI know that an image can be made resizable by using the codeUIImage resizableImageWithCapInsetsUIEdgeInsetscapInsetscode method. So that works great for the horizontal direction but that method cannot be used for the vertical direction it really needs to be tiled, and not stretched in the vertical direction to work.p  pNow my idea of how this could work is to run a loop that creates a UIImageView with the horizontally stretched image, and simply adjust the frame.origin.y property, then add it as a subview each loop until Ive gone past the height of the view. However this seems like an overly complex way of doing this and really not practical when the view need to be resized on an iPad rotation for examplep  pIs there a simpler more efficient way of doing this on iOS 6.xp

Negative 506 pI am using OSX TexLive MacTeX, which does not support the latexmk options for codeauxdirectorycode or codeauxdircode.  There is no builtin method to send the auxiliary files somewhere else, but keep the new .pdf file in the working directory of the .tex file.  Thus, I can either cleanup the working directory, or copy the .pdf file from an codeoutputdirectorycode back to the working directory.p  pI am looking for some suggestions, please, regarding how best to create an event listener that would trigger phase two 2 of either of the Sublime Text 2 plugins below.  Phase one 1 is to build a latex document and create a .pdf which takes time.  Phase two 2 is either cleanup the working directory using the builtin latexmk script with the little codeccode option or, copy the .pdf from the codeoutputdirectorycode to the working directory containing the .tex file.  Both plugins work and phase two 2 is configured with a 10 second lambda timeout so that the latexmk build process has an opportunity to finish before proceeding to phase two 2.  [The codelatexmkcode command works here without an absolute path because the codePATHcode has been set with a different plugin.]p  pSometimes LaTeX documents fail to build correctly because of an error e.g., typo in the .tex document.  When there is a failed build process, it is not necessary to cleanup or copy the .pdf   i.e., a .pdf might not have even been created, or it will contain errors.p  pstrongThe heart of the question is what exactly is the codeeventcode that occurs when a LaTeX document builds correctly and, what exactly is the codeeventcode that occurs when a build failsstrongp  pThe goal will be to have phase two 2 of either plugin automatically activate upon a thorough completion of a successful LaTeX build.  If the build process fails, then do not proceed to phase two 2  and display an error message  codeOoops  The build process failed  please check the .tex document for errors.codep  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  precodeimport sublime, sublimeplugin import os, os.path, shutil  class LatexmkWorkingDirectorysublimeplugin.TextCommand    def runself, edit       self.view.window.runcommandexec, cmd [latexmk, r, UsersHOMELibraryApplication SupportSublime Text 2PackagesUser0.latexmkrc.latexmkrc, self.view.filename ]       sublime.settimeoutlambda self.view.window.runcommandexec, cmd [latexmk, c, r, UsersHOMELibraryApplication SupportSublime Text 2PackagesUser0.latexmkrc.latexmkrc, self.view.filename ], 10000  class LatexmkOutputDirectorysublimeplugin.TextCommand    def runself, edit       path, file  os.path.splitself.view.filename       prefix, suffix  os.path.splitextfile       self.view.window.runcommandexec, cmd [latexmk, r, UsersHOMELibraryApplication SupportSublime Text 2PackagesUser0.latexmkrc.latexmkrc, outputdirectorytmp, self.view.filename ]       sublime.settimeoutlambda shutil.copyfiletmp  prefix  .pdf, path    prefix  .pdf, 10000 codepre  hr  pAlthough not yet a solution to the proposed event listener plugin, the following two lines of code when added to codethe very endcode of LaTexTools makePDF.py, will automatically cleanup upon successful completion of building the .pdf file.

The codeauxdirectorycode limitation is within TexLive not latexmk  i.e., latexmk relies upon TexLive to do all of the magic.]p  pKnown Issues  Hardwiring the the latexmk.pl script to cleanup will prevent the LaTexTools plugin from doing its magic because it relies upon the .log file.

Pretty much just as baseline as you can get... sorry for the confusionp  hr  pWe are given an adjacency matrix, where elements are related to each other connected in the following examplep  precode0,1,5    0 is connected to 1, and the weight of the edge is 5 0,2,7    0 is connected to 2, and the weight of the edge is 7 0,3,8    0 is connected to 3, and the weight of the edge is 8 1,2,10   1 is connected to 2, and the weight of the edge is 10 1,3,7    1 is connected to 3, and the weight of the edge is 7 2,3,3    2 is connected to 3, and the weight of the edge is 3 codepre  hr  pBut never mind the input, just assume that we have a matrix of values to manipulate.p  pWe are looking at storing all the possible paths in a shortest path algorithm Im sure 75 or more of people on SO know Dijkstras algorithm. This IS for homework, but an implementation question, not a solve this for me question.p  pcodeASSUMEcode that the size of the matrix is codevery largecode size M x M, maybe more than code50x50code in size. This would result in code[501]2   1.52  1064code results in the result list assuming that our algorithm was smart enough to pick out duplicates and not find the length of a duplicate path which it is not, because we are noobs at Graph Theory and Java, so please dont suggest any algorithm to avoid duplicates....p  hr  pMy friend says that a temp sort using a temporary variable on an index of int[n] in a List, where int[n] is the codelast indexcode and codevalue of the shortest pathcode ALGORITHM1 may be faster than TreeMap ALGORITHM2 where the codekeycode of the Map is the codevalue of the shortest pathcode.p  pWe were debating as to what implementation would be faster in trying to find ALL codelengthscode of the shortest path. We can store it as the last index of each path have an int[] where the last element is the value sum of the shortest path all elements int the array ALGORITHM1, OR we can store that sum as the KEY of the Map ALGORITHM2.p  pBecause this is a codeshortest path algorithmcode albeit not a great one..., we NEED to sort the results of each path by length, which is the sum of each edge in the graph, in order to find the shortest path.p  hr  pSo the real question is what would be faster in sorting the results codeONLY ONE TIMEcode Through a Map.sort algorithm built into the Java standard library or through creating a temporary variable to hold the value of the most recent length in each int[] For examplep  precodemyMap.sort  Unless TreeMap in Java does behindthescenes sorting on keys... myMap.get0  This would return the first element of the map, which is the shortest path codepre  pORp  precodeint temp  myList.get0[m]  Store a temp variable that is the shortest path for int[] i in myListltint[]gt      if temp gt myList.geti[m]   Check if the current path is shorter than the previous         temp  myList.geti[m]  Replace temp if current path is shorter       codepre  hr  pcodeNotecode that I havent actually tested the implementations yet, nor have I checked my own Java syntax, so I dont know if these statements are declared correctly. This is just a theoretical question. Which would run faster This is my 3rd year of Java and I dont know the underlying data structures used in HashMap, nor the Big O notation of either implementation.p  pPerhaps someone who knows the Java standard could describe what kind of data structures or implementations are used in HashMap vs Primitive data type[], and what the differences in run times might be in a codeONETIMEONLYcode sort of the structures.p  pI hope that this inquiry makes sense, and I thank anyone who takes the time to answer my question I always appreciate the time and effort generous people such as yourselves put into helping to educate the newbiesp  pRegards,      Chrisp
Negative 506 pI have created a unit testing framework, pFUnit, that largely follows the current design of JUnit, and am looking for suggestions on how to extend this framework to handle a certain situation.  For the curious, this framework pFUnit is written in OO Fortran yes  Fortran now has OO capabilities and supports distributed programing using MPI.   But I think the only pertinent aspect about language choice is that if the SUT actually crashes, the testing framework does as well.   Fortunately, that is a relatively rare situation, but it still happens often enough to scream for a solution.p  pMy intent had been to provide an alternate TestRunner that will run each test as a separate executable as an RPC or something similar.   The runtime overhead for this can be large, especially when launching MPI repeatedly, so I do not want to make this the default behavior.   Unfortunately, when I looked into how to code this approach, I found that TestRunner does not appear to be ideally suited for such an extension as it only manages the run of the top of a nested seriest of TestSuites.  p  pI can see a klunky way of making it work by having the TestRunner navigate the nested structure, but it would undermine the role of TestSuite in a major way.p  pActually, the easiest approach Ive come up with is to subclass TestResult.   TestResult invokes runBare on each TestCase,  so an extension could simply be to launch a separate executable that just invokes that runBare method and returns any exceptions.     This solution bothers my sense of aesthetics, as it is not the sort of thing for which TestResult ought to be responsible.p  pI could also add a launch method to TestCase that checks some global parameter to determine whether to run as a procedure or to launch as a separate executable.  This seems inelegant, but is probably not much more difficult than the TestResult extension I mentioned before.p  pHopefully this is enough background that a person with deeper understanding of JUnits design can suggest a bettercleaner approach than the alternatives Ive proposed.  Or failing that offer me absolution for the design sins I have proposed.p

Negative 506 pIm trying to rebuild a emViewem for my database, this is for a hockey statistics application I am building.p  pMy situation is this I am recording data for scoring plays, each codeIndividualScoreHockeycode has a  codeTeamIdcode and codeGameIdcode.

Negative 506 pHave a UserControl that must never exceed 700px in width. Have set its MaxWidths to 700px.p  pInside is a grid  3 columns. First and second column will have labels, third column will input fields.

Negative 506 pI have a database of codeCardcodes and codePrintingcodes that I have in one store reference data and my users data of codeContainercodes and codeCardInstancecodes in another store as Apple suggests.  Each users card is a table codeCardInstancecode that contains a specific codeprintingIDcode that corresponds with a specific printing of a card.  Im trying to use a codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to filter the values of the cards so that it can manage the groupings and stuff using reusable code.p  pAgain, heres the basic overview of the tables codeCardcode which has codenameNormalizedcode and codealphaNormalizedcode and codetypeNormalizedcode properties that I want to filter and group on in the Fetched Results Controller. codePrintingcode which has a codecardcode relationship and a specific codeprintingIDcode codeCardInstancecode which has a codecontainercode relationship, a codeprintingIDcode property, and a codeprintingFetchcode fetched property on codePrintingcode with predicate codeprintingID  FETCHSOURCE.printingIDcode. codeContainercode which has a tomany relationship of codeCardInstancecodes.p  pGiven a codeContainercode, Im wanting to use a NSFetchedResultsController so that I can change the sort and groupings between name and type sections.  So I have a fetchRequest where Ive set the entity type to codeCardInstancecode and one predicate to codecontainer  code, the given container. p  p1 How do I set the sort descriptors so that I can sort on codeprintingFetch.card.nameNormalizedcode or on codeprintingFetch.card.typeNormalizedcodep  p2 How do I filter the results if I want to find all cards containing the word the  I was thinking something along the lines of codeprintingFetch.card.nameNormalized contains code, the, but that just results in a crash.p  pI realize I could do this all manually, but if the container ends up containing a lot of cards, that may be way too slow and Id like to not have to rewrite the sectioning and grouping code that codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode should automatically do for me.p

Negative 506 pI am new to c, learning through Accelerated C by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo.p  pI am unable to grasp the concept of buffer in C as the book says strongMost systems take a significant amount of time to write characters to an output device, regardless of how many characters there are to write. To avoid the overhead of writing in response to each output request, the library uses the buffer to accumulate the characters to be written, and flushes the buffer, by writing its contents to the output device, only when necessary. By doing so, it can combine several output operations into a single write.strongp  pWhy do most systems take a significant amount of time to write characters to an output device What is this buffer and why do we require itWhy do we require flushing buffersp

Negative 506 pIm working on a jQuery image carouselrotator, and Ive gotten stuck. Normally, I use Bootstrap for my carousels, and Id be happy to do so again  but this carousel has an extra function I dont think Bootstrap can handle. We use Smarty templates, so the carousel contents, and the number of items in the carousel are totally variable.p  pIve attached a graphic explaining what I would like to do. Section A on the graphic is a typical thumbnail and arrowbased carousel navigation. Section B is the current image in the carousel, which slides up from the bottom. Sections A and B are both working in Bootstrap. Section C is where Im running into troubles. I need to display captions, cycling through the three given containers as the carousel turns. I would prefer to have the captions move from top to bottom next caption and previous caption opposite of where I have drawn them, doh.p  pIf anyone knows of a plugin that can be setup or modified to do this, that would be great. Id also like to hear any ideas anyone has of how to do this custom. I guess adding classes like .active, .previous, and .next are one way to go, but Im not sure how to deal with the index starting over. Honestly, this is approaching the upper levels of my abilities, which is why I need an extra kick from you.p  pUnfortunately, Im not in a position to share my current BootstrapSmarty code with you  However, Id be happy to answer any questions you might have.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu3rCm.png altQuick sketch of my carousel dilemmap

Negative 506 pThis question is quite specific and long, and deals with strongextending CodeIgniters modelsstrong. Its not vital my application works currently but Im asking this because Im wondering if there is a clean way to do this.p  pI rencently wrote a a hrefhttpsheljohn.blogspot.fr201306ontemplatelikemethodsinphp.html relnofollowblog posta about a trick Im using to strongmake CRUD methods genericstrong for my models. Because Im only using the database library when models are involved, I extended the core Model MYModel to simply load database from its constructor rather than autoload it. Its not a big deal to autoload it, but the point is and its important for what follows I might want to use this constructor to perform other things in the future, so there emneedsem to be a constructor.p  pWhen I though about making the CRUD methods generic, I thought about using MYModel again, and was able to define create, update, delete, and loadfromid methods successfully. However, these methods rely implicitely on an stronginterfacestrong, or set of methods that need to be defined in any model in addition to the staticconstant parameters override, for example some validation, or a function to be called on delete to cascade specific consequences in the DB. Two solutions use PHP stronginterfacesstrong or make MYModel strongabstractstrong and declare abstract methods.p  pThe solution 2 cannot be implemented, because I need a valid contructor in MYModel, and in any case, I need to be able to call CIModels constructor even if theres nothing in it so far, I cant assume there never will be. In this case, the inheritance stack would be concrete [codeCIModelcode], abstract [codeMYModelcode], concrete [codeAnymodelcode], and I would need to skip a generation when calling codeparentconstructcode from my concrete model. Plus I dont know if CI supports abstract core classes extension.p  pFor the solution 1, Im not sure it can be implemented either. Lets say I define a concrete class codeMYModelcode and an interface codeCrudModelInterfacecode. I put all the attributes in codeMYModelcode they cant be in the interface, but then my CRUD methods need to use them, so codeCrudModelInterfacecode must extend codeMYModelcode right Thats where it gets fuzzy to me... p  pProvided that you understood what I want to do, could you please advise me about my design, how you would do it, etc. Anything constructive. Currently, I simply didnt impose the constraints to define those interface methods, but Im doing it in every model, so it works. Its just not very clean.p

Negative 506 pI have been learning about templates in C and they seem very handy. However, there was a note about the problems using templates in a large, multifile project in a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comdoctutorialtemplates relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comdoctutorialtemplatesa at the very bottom Because templates are compiled when required, this forces a restriction for multifile projects the implementation definition of a template class or function must be in the same file as its declaration.p  pSo take for example, wanting to write a 2D Vector class template which operates on codeTcode typenamep  precode    template ltclass Tgt     class Vector          T x, y     public         VectorT x, T y                      thisgtx  x             thisgty  y                   void normalize                      T length  sqrtx  x  y  y              x  x  length             y  y  length               codepre  pMy question is rather simple, where would you put this template so that multiple .cpp files have access to it If you put it inside of, say, a Math.h file where you keep all of your other custom math related declarations, do you have to codeinlinecode the functions because they are in a header filep
Negative 506 pI just started working on an existing big project. Some of it contains legacy code.br I have been asked to write a component will run in the same process which should alert and restart the server in case of a Fatal error or a situation occurred.  p  pFor example, when an OutOfMemoryException is thrown I should alert the clients and then restart the server. The problem is, it will be hard and time consuming to search for all the existing Trycatch blocks and then to edit and add new code to their catch blocks. More than that, a new programmer could add a new trycatch block and forget to alert if OutOfMemoryException is catched.  p  pDo you have any idea on how to monitorlisten for OutOfMemoryException and similar exceptions without the need to find and edit and maybe add to every existing and future Trycatch blocks    p  pIm using .Net 4.  p  pEdit p  ol liOutOfMemoryException is only an example.   li liThere could be legacy code which catches OutOfMemoryException, prints a message to log then do nothing.  li ol

Negative 506 pThe title is probably a little misleading, because im not sure what to name it.p  pWeve created a webbased system that we sell to our clients. We do all the hosting and what not. Incase we have a new client that bought the system, we copy one from a different customer and change the logos, etc. p  pNow if we made changes, lets say we found a bug and fix it, we have to go through all the systems and change the file that had the bug. And this is something that im looking at changing.p  pBasically what im looking for is a easy way to keep this organized and easy to push to production. But also want the flexibility to, if a client wants a specific feature, that were able to easily change it, instead of updating every system with this feature.p  pSo whenever we make a change in the core of the system, I would like to somehow push over the fixed file to all other systems, instead doing it manually, which is kind of a hassle and stupid way of doing it.p  pNow I thought this is possible with git, through some kind of branch construct that would merge into a main branch, but im not too certain about this and cant find anything about it.p  pDoes anyone know what this is called or is there a way to do thisp

I cannot distinguish if the user has entered a bad password or if the password has to be changed.p  pMSDN documentation says If AuthenticationTypes.Secure is set, the WinNT provider uses NTLM to authenticate the client.

Negative 506 pI currently have a set of rules to create usernames based on a users initials.  This is not adjustable.  So a user has xxx as his initials. His username would be zzxxx1.  The next user with the same initials would be zzxxx2 and so on. Im using Java to generate the ids useridCreation.jar. This jar is being called by a multithreaded application ITIM.  So how would I go about reserving zzxxx1 until the first user is finished being created so as to not have duplicate usernames.  This is a feed type situation where the usernames are being generated. I can pull up to 4 userssec. I was thinking Vector, but Im not too familiar with multithreaded applications so Im not sure how to approach that.

Negative 506 pIve got a working jQuery script that runs ok meaning it serves its purpose.p  pThe question is how to make strongthis script more efficientstrongp  pCurrently the script becomes active the moment a user places the mouse over hover a certain HTML5 sectiontag with an ID. At this moment the script removes the existing class named noDisplay from a subordinate navtag containing a submenu list, hence content becomes visible to the user. This submenu list may be three to four levels deep. The submenus are held in classes subMenu1, subMenu2, subMenu3, subMenu4, etc..  The script is written to serve individually each of the given section IDs and its sublevel classes.p  pBasically the script interacts with the DOM by removing the class noDisplay upon mouse hover and restores the same class upon mouse leave. Tried to give a clear explanation. If not please ask.p  pHere is a JSfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsnahl3epRN relnofollowenter link description hereap  pI hope someone can suggest a way to do this much more efficiently. Possibly with more sections IDs and subMenulevels a class per level.p  pUsing the strongCSS properties display none and displayblockstrong would be the simplest solution but this is strongnot desiredstrong because a searchbot my decide to skip content flagged as invisible to the user or a screenreader. The class NoDisplay in use here keeps content invisible to users and keeps its readability to screen readers and thus to most of the search bots.p  pSo basically the script function remains as is to strongremove and add the class noDisplay upon hoverstrong. The goal is to obtain a strongscript that is more efficientstrong that could use for instance variables for each section, instead of writing code for each new section and hence extending the current script. p  precodesection1section1 .NavUL1 .subMenu1.hoverfunction     .NavUL2.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     .NavUL2.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section1.hoverfunction     section1 .NavUL1.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     section1 .NavUL1.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section1 .NavUL1 .subMenu1.hoverfunction     .NavUL2.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     .NavUL2.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section2 section2.hoverfunction     section2 .NavUL1.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     section2 .NavUL1.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section2 .subMenu1.hoverfunction     .subMenu1 .NavUL2.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     .subMenu1 .NavUL2.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section2 .subMenu2.hoverfunction     .subMenu2 .NavUL2.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     .subMenu2 .NavUL2.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section2 .subMenu3.hoverfunction     .subMenu3 .NavUL2.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     .subMenu3 .NavUL2.addClassnoDisplay            no display  section2 .subMenu4.hoverfunction     .subMenu4 .NavUL2.removeClassnoDisplay            display     ,function     .subMenu4 .NavUL2.addClassnoDisplay            no display  codepre

Negative 506 pIm trying to make a Java program that allows users to do some limited scripting with a Ruby DSL that Ive written. The script the user writes is saved to a Proc object in JRuby. The problem arises in that the user can still access methods that are standard to Ruby, such as codeFile.newcode, or creating classes, or basically messing with other internal logic of the program or computer.p  pIs there a way to limit the users script to only the constraints of the DSL, using JRuby or Ruby or even Java Or at least to remove the users access to certain classesp

Negative 506 pI phrased the title as well as  I possibly could. Basically, heres my scenariop  pI have a strongstringstrong, not a file, that I need to read from. In this string, I want to check if there is a certain piece of text in this file. If this text is found in the string, I want to read this text up until I want to stop. More specifically, Im getting text from a webpage and storing it in a string. In this text, there is an ID that the user is given. I want to check for the text where the ID is given. If I find this text in the string, I want to continue reading until I get the actual ID, then I need to stop reading. Yes, I could just manually read the ID myself, and to be honest its probably a better solution, but I wanna have some fun and see how something like this could be done, if it can be done at all. Heres the code I havep  precode        if Your ID is  in strresponse             print Found ID               Id probably have something here to store the ID in a variable for later use.              I need to be able to check for the ID after I check for the text Your ID is . I check for this because I know where to start reading from. I have no way of telling what line the ID could possibly be on. codepre  pHopefully that made sense. I just need to check if a certain piece of text is in a string, and if it is read just a little more of that text and then store that in a variable for later use. This is probably a rare case and Ill probably never use it, but it never hurts to see whats possible and how its possible, rightp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 506 pI was just looking at the Java Hamcrest code on GitHub, and noticed they employed a strategy that seemed unintuitive and awkward, but it got me wondering if Im missing something.p  pI noticed in the HamCrest API that there is an interface iba hrefhttpsgithub.comhamcrestJavaHamcrestblobmasterhamcrestapisrcmainjavaorghamcrestMatcher.javaMatcherabi and an abstract class iba hrefhttpsgithub.comhamcrestJavaHamcrestblobmasterhamcrestcoresrcmainjavaorghamcrestBaseMatcher.javaBaseMatcherabi.  The Matcher interface declares this method, with this javadocp  precode           This method simply acts a friendly reminder not to implement Matcher directly and       instead extend BaseMatcher. Its easy to ignore JavaDoc, but a bit harder to ignore       compile errors .             see Matcher for reasons why.       see BaseMatcher       deprecated to make           Deprecated     void dontimplementMatcherinsteadextendBaseMatcher codepre  pThen in BaseMatcher, this method is implemented as followsp  precode           see MatcherdontimplementMatcherinsteadextendBaseMatcher           Override     Deprecated     public final void dontimplementMatcherinsteadextendBaseMatcher           See Matcher interface for an explanation of this method.      codepre  pAdmittedly, this is both effective and cute and incredibly awkward.  But if the intention is for every class that implements Matcher to also extend BaseMatcher, why use an interface at all  Why not just make Matcher an abstract class in the first place and have all other matchers extend it  Is there some advantage to doing it the way Hamcrest has done it  Or is this a great example of bad practicep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSome good answers, but in search of more detail Im offering a bounty.

Negative 506 pI am receiving a syntax error in a form that I have created over a query.  I created the form to restrict access to changing records.  While trying to set filters on the form, I receive syntax errors for all attributes I try to filter on.  I believe this has something to do with the lack of codecode around the inner join within the query code, but what is odd to me is that I can filter the query with no problem.

Negative 506 pIm running into a bit of an issue. I have some asp.net controls wrapped in an update panel, but when I click the submit button it jumps to the top of the page. Ive read a bunch of posts on here, and they either require use of some javascript or say set the MaintainPagePostion to true in the page directive. I tried setting it to true, that did not work. I really dont want to use a javascript script to accomplish this either. I was under the impression that this is one of the benefits to using an update panel. However, the part that I find most confusing, is it used to not do this. I dont remember changing anything on the website that would have caused this. Any help with this problem is appreciated.

Negative 506 pIm working with Websphere 7 and Websphere MQ 7 I have a message driven bean MDB deployed in Websphere which is bound to a WebSphere MQ Activation Specification configured queue.  The MDB will be receiving messages in EDCIDIC format and need to convert this  into ASCII. In the past, directly connecting to the MQ server using native MQ API we had the option to programmatically  convert the message using i.e.  the following excerptp  precodegmo.options  MQC.MQGMOCONVERT Handles EBCDICASCII getq  qmgr.accessQueueresponseQueue whiletrue      MQMessage msgId  new MQMessage     msgId.characterSet  1208     getq.getmsgId, gmo  codepre  pBut using MDBs JMS  there doesnt seem to be an option to instruct the conversion. I suspect Websphere should have a setting to do the conversion as it acts as a bridge between  MQ server and the MDB but cant seem to find a setting in the console.p  pAny ideas please p

Negative 506 pIm making a map for a website, where I have a Google map that needs to have around 30000 markers put on it. The time it takes to plot all the markers is not an issue, but I have a loading icon that needs to disappear when all the markers have been placed. Right now it disappears when the map has loaded and it starts to place the markers. I have tried adding listeners for all the events Google list on a hrefhttpgmapssamplesv3.googlecode.comsvntrunkmapeventsmapevents.html relnofollowtheir own events API example pagea, and none of them fire when all markers have been loaded. I thought maybe codeidlecode would have fired, but it fires when the map has been shown, and not when markers are put on, which is a good 510 seconds after showing the map. p  pI use MarkerClusterers, and I have also tried binding the codeclusteringendcode event, but that happens at the same time of idle, for some reason. p  pIs there an event that fires when all markers are loaded, or can I fake one p

Negative 506 pI was looking if anyone could help me out on writing this simple code. I would like to make it where I have 2 text boxes and one button. In one of the text boxes I would be inputting a sentence. The second text box I would be inputting the same sentence but a little modified where it would have a miss spelling in one of the words. When I hit the verify button it would check both of the text boxes to see if each of the sentences entered are the same. If they are the same then I would get a message Same. If they are different then I would get a message different and it would display where the error is in the sentence by changing the word in red or something like that.p

The attempt below makes the left column horizontally scrollable even though there is only empty space, which makes moving the panels a pain I simplified the Django stuff, all of that works.p  precodeltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcolmd3gt         ltdiv classunsortedList dataspyaffix dataoffsettop0gt             lth4gtNot assignedlth4gt             ltul id0 classlistunstyled connectedListsgt                  for student in group.0                      ltli classpanel panelprimary innerpanelgt                         ltinput typehidden ...gt                         ltdiv classpanelbodygt                              student                          ltdivgt                     ltligt                  endfor              ltulgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classcolmd9gt          for i in numberofgroups              ltdiv classcolmd4 idpanel i gt                 ltdiv classpanel paneldefault outerpanelgt                     ltdiv classpanelheadinggt                         Group  iadd1                          ltspan classbadge pullright idbadge i gtltspangt                     ltdivgt                     ltdiv classpanelbodygt                         ltul id i  classlistunstyled connectedListsgt                              for student in group                                  ltli classpanel panelprimary innerpanelgt                                     ltinput typehidden...gt                                     ltdiv classpanelbodygt                                          student                                      ltdivgt                                 ltligt                              endfor                          ltulgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt          endfor      ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classrowgt     ltinput typesubmit valueSave Groups classbtn btndefaultgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe Save Groups button at the end is another pain, as it appears in the middle of the left column sometimes.p  pThe relevant CSS is as followsp  precode.connectedLists      minheight100px   to allow moving of panels into empty lists   .innerpanel      width170px  to make the student panels the same size   .unsortedList      overflowyauto     height85     width200px  codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong in the grid layout Thanksp

So, its seems like this should work finep  precodevar thing  data.contkey[0].Thing thingid1.appendthing codepre  pBut it returns codeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property 0 of undefinedcode. Whereas, if I enter the name directly, i.e.p  precodevar thing  data.crs20868[0].Thing thingid1.appendthing codepre  pcodefoocode gets appended to my HTML ID codethingid1code fine. As suggested, however, Ill never know what that containing key name is when I run my AJAX call.

Negative 506 pI need to build a web service that accepts XML data.

I need to know how to get them in the first place. I cannot find anything that explains how to build a webservice that accepts strongXMLstrong as input.p  pstrongWhat is the parameter type I should use for a webservice method that should receive XML Is it a string Is it an XmlDocument Something elsestrongp  pstrongCan someone provide links to tutorial on how to create the C classes and whatnot emfromem the XSDstrongp  pEverything I have found indicates thats it is emusuallyem done by creating the classes in C and then using a tool to create the XSD. However, I need to go the opposite direction. Where can I go to learn to do this I dont care if I have to do it by hand Im not looking for a tool to do it for me.p  pClearly I am very inexperience with web services, so I appreciate any help you can offer. But please dont direct me to basic web service tutorials because I have already done several I stopped when they started repeating material Id already done.p  pAlso, please do not tell me You need to learn about XML, Web Services, Serialization, etc and other such overly broad handwaving answers. I am aware that I need to earn about those things, and I am working on it. If you could be more specific, such as first learn about X classes in c, then learn about Y or learn about X concepts in WSDL, then learn about Y concepts of serialization in C, etc, that would help.p  pstrongIf anyone could direct me to any free online courses  tutorial series that go through the process, that would be awesome as well.strongp  pEdit Ok, apparently this question is not as specific as I think it is, so here is an example.p  pThis is what another agency will send to my web servicep  precodeltPersongt     ltLegalNamegt       ltFirstNamegtRalphltFirstNamegt       ltLastNamegtAndersonltLastNamegt       ltPhoneticFirstNamegtrahlfltPhoneticFirstNamegt     ltLegalNamegt     ltSSNgt122341232ltSSNgt     ltDemographicsgt       ltSexgtmaleltSexgt       ltHeightgt502ltHeightgt     ltDemographicsgt     ltDriversLicensegt       ltDriversLicenseNumbergt1234ltDriversLicenseNumbergt       ltIssuingStategtCAltIssuingStategt     ltDriversLicensegt ltPersongt codepre  pMy understanding is I need to write something like thisp  precodepublic Service        [WebMethod]     public void CreateRecordXmlDocument newRecord               do stuff       codepre

The app is a simple webview, and it works as expected, using this a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.commultidevicewebviewgettingstarted relnofollowtutoriala. However, Id like to append every request from the app webview with a constant string, this way in the request logs I can determine which requests were from apps, and which were from the native website. Its easy enough to do for the landing page, but for subsequent actions such as login or create account, nothing is appended.p  pI was thinking I could create a class similar to the tutorial, where, for every link, I append the string. Being a FNG to android development I figured Id better ask if there is a better way to accomplish the desired result before I start hacking away.p

Negative 506 pIm creating nice icons using HTML Canvas feature. But Ive just noticed that theyre all pixelbased, I mean raster graphics, not vectors. Im leaning more into using HTML Canvas than  using SVG. The way Canvas works is very similar to SVG anyway namely, they both serve lines and curves defined by mathematical equations. So I wonder if theres a way to render those images as vectors or at least to get them prescaled e.g 2x bigger if realtime scaling is not possible at all.p

Negative 506 pI have a Virtual Machine running 64bit Windows 2008 Server R2. I have a bunch of processes running on it and we have noticed that the Memory Usage reported by the Performance Tab of the Windows Task Manager increases over time. In order to determine the processes that may be leaking memory, I ran a scheduled task every 5 minutes for 2 days that collects the Working Size for all the running processes. When I plotted the Memory Usage reported by Performance Tab in Windows Task Manager, Expected free memoryTotal memory  sum of Working size for all processes and the difference between these two, I see that the sum of the Working size for all processes is pretty flat i.e. no process appears to leak memory. However, the Memory Usage reported by Performance Tab in Windows Task Manager continues to increase steadily. When this memory usage reaches 8 GB total memory, the machine crashes and has be rebooted manually. After the reboot, the memory usage starts from a low value and then again rises steadily.p  pAny ideas on how I can determine the entity that is using increasing amount of memory p

Negative 506 pIm trying to understand the behaviour of a Windows toolbar  in particular how the following values interactp  ul lithe size of the bitmap image usedli lithe effective size of a toolbar buttonli lithe padding between the image and the button edgeli lithe height of the toolbarli ul  pText displayed by a button is not relevant in my case.p  pWhat I actually want to do is provide an option for the user so he can choose from several toolbar button sizes that will display bitmaps of say, 16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels and redisplay the toolbar accordingly after the option value changes. This is implemented by destroying the toolbars image lists and rebuilding them with the appropriate bitmaps. The problem I currently have is that when switching from size 16 to 48 and back to size 16, the toolbar looks slightly different than before.p  pThis is what the toolbar looks like when the application starts correctp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKLiOc.png altBefore switching the toolbar sizep  pOnce I switch to size 48 and back again, it looks like this wrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiBMuQ.png altAfter switching to a larger size and backp  pAll buttons are higher than before, and each dropdown button has additional space around its bitmap and its dropdown arrow.p  pFor testing purposes, the toolbar has been made high enough to accomodate all button sizes without requiring an increase in height. This is to rule out the possibility that the change in button size stems from a possible toolbar resize, necessitated by temporarily switching to size 48.p  pIt looks as if additional padding were being rendered between a button bitmap and the button edge  as if rebuilding the toolbar with larger bitmapsbuttons caused Windows to internally increase the padding which would make sense, but not decrease it when I subsequently rebuild the toolbar with the smaller bitmapsbuttons. However, sending TBGETPADDING always returns 0x00060007, which indicates that the standard correct padding for 16x16 bitmaps is in place.p  pIn an attempt to solve the problem by setting padding myself, I set the TBSTYLEAUTOSIZE style on all nonseparator buttons this is required in order to apply padding. With this style, without even calling TBSETPADDING, after switching to size 48 and back again, the toolbar looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUXfo7.png altAfter switching to a larger size and back, with TBSTYLEAUTOSIZEp  pIn this case, the button height is also wrong.p  pstrongThe question isstrong What is causing the buttons to be displayed differently after rebuilding the image listsp  pSome aside notesp  ul liWhen building the toolbar, I call TBSETBITMAPSIZE, but neither TBSETBUTTONSIZE nor TBSETPADDING, because the bitmap size is all I have, and I assumed the button size would be derived correctly from that.li liIm aware I could simply build the entire toolbar window from scratch not just the image lists, but would like to avoid that, so I can keep working with the same toolbar window handle.li liIm aware of the CCSNORESIZE toolbar style its currently set and the TBAUTOSIZE message, but experiments with them have not led to any insights.li ul

Negative 506 pAs far as I understand it, the stack pointer points to the free memory on the stack, and pushing data on the stack writes to the location pointed by the stack pointer and incrementsdecrements it.p  pBut isnt it possible to use offsets from the frame pointer to achieve the same thing, thus saving a register. The overhead from adding offsets to the frame pointer is pretty much the same as the overhead of incrementing and decrementing the stack pointer. The only advantage I see is accessing data from the top or bottom will be faster, as long as it is not a push or pop operation, e.g. just reading or writing to that address without incrementingdecrementing. But then again, such operations would take a single extra cycle using the frame pointer, and there will be one additional register for general purpose use.p  pIt seems like only the frame pointer is really needed. And it even serves a lot more purpose than just modifying data in the current stack frame, such as to be used in debugging and for stack unwinding. Am I missing somethingp

Negative 506 pThe page I am developing requires that there be two lists, one of which to add items to and then order those items. I am using Jquery plugin called nestable where you can drag and drop list items. it works fine when there are items prepopulated in the list, but when i make an empty list i cannot drag items onto it. I have tried using the ddempty class everywhere divs in different locations the ol class, the li class and nothing seems to work completely. The closest thing that works is setting the ol class to ddempty. it creates an empty slot which i can drag one item to, however it does not allow me to drag anymore items or drag that item back to the original list.p  pAm i doing something wrong maybe in my CSS or is this just a bug that nestable hasp  pLet me know if you have any questions or need to see my code.p

Negative 506 pI couldnt get my head around this question, need help just a direction would be great..p  pLet there be a rooted directed tree T, not necessarily binary. p  pThere is a weight associated with each vertex, such that the weight of a vertex is greater than the weight of the vertexs parent. p  pEach vertex can be designated as either a regular or a pivot vertex. p  pThe cost of a pivot vertex is the same as its weight.p  pRegular vertices get discounts their cost is their weight minus the weight of the closest ancestor that is a pivot vertex. p  pThus, selecting a vertex as a pivot vertex may increase its cost, but it will decrease the costs of some of its descendants. p  pIf a regular vertex has no ancestor which is a pivot vertex, then its cost is its weight itself. There is no limit on the number of pivot vertices.p  pI have to design an efficient algorithm to designate every vertex as either a regular vertex or a pivot vertex, such that the total cost of all vertices is minimized.p

Negative 506 pIm having the toughest time figuring out how to register a custom ISiteMapNodeVisibilityProvider SiteMapNodeVisibilityProviderBase using Autofac in MvcSiteMapProvider. p  pEverything was working fine up until the point that I moved the visibility provider to another assembly.  Now, no matter what I try, I always get codeThe visibility provider instance named MyWasWorkingVisibilityProvider, MyNewAssembly was not found. Check your DI configuration to ensure a visibility provider instance with this name exists and is configured correctly.codep  pAccording to the MvcSiteMapProvider documentation and code, it appears I need to somehow into the SiteMapNodeVisibilityProviderStrategy... and I think Ive done that below... But Im no Autofac ninja. p  pIn codeMvcSiteMapProviderModule.cscode, I added the new assembly everywhere I could think... p  precodestring[] includeAssembliesForScan  new string[]  MyOldAssembly, MyNewAssembly   var allAssemblies  new Assembly[]  currentAssembly, siteMapProviderAssembly, typeofMyWasWorkingVisibilityProvider.Assembly   builder.RegisterTypeltSiteMapNodeVisibilityProviderStrategygt     .AsltISiteMapNodeVisibilityProviderStrategygt     .WithParametersnew ListltParametergt  new NamedParameterdefaultProviderName, string.Empty, new NamedParametersiteMapNodeVisibilityProviders, new []  new MyWasWorkingVisibilityProvider     builder.RegisterTypeltMyWasWorkingVisibilityProvidergt     .AsltISiteMapNodeVisibilityProvidergt codepre  pBut it still doesnt work. p  pFor what its worth, the visibility provider for any specific menu item is configured in the database, and the entire menu structure is loaded with a dynamic node provider that is also now in the same assembly as where Ive moved the visibility providers. The dynamic node provider is obviously working because its getting all the way to the point where its trying to load visibility providers. p  pI thought a hrefhttpsgithub.commaartenbaMvcSiteMapProviderissues237 relnofollowhttpsgithub.commaartenbaMvcSiteMapProviderissues237a looked helpful, I couldnt get the visibility providerspecific code to compile..p  pAnother example that didnt have any effect a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19160785mvcsitemapprovidersitemappathperformanceveryslowMVC Site Map Provider  SiteMapPath Performance Very Slowap  pSo Im stuck now. Im not a wizard with Autofac OR MvcSiteMap provider, but, like I said, everything was working fine until I moved the visibility provider to another assembly. p  pThanks very much for your time and attention Im frustrated at this point. p

Negative 506 pIn Socket.io for Node, I am a little confused how the number of clients are being tracked.  In the demo offered by Socket.io, they have a global variable numUsers in their server.js and when a new client connects, client.js communicates with server.js and numUsers increments.  However, how does numUsers keep track of the number of clients, even though its value is not stored in a database  When every unique user goes on the website, are the socket connections directed to one server, where they all can see the value of numUsers, instead of numUsers being set to 0 for every user going to the website  Thank you.p

I could be wrong and maybe it is just too broad.p  hr  pThis is kind of a difficult question for my to put into words as it might be a design issue, or a problem with the way Im thinking about delegates likely, or maybe I am worrying about nothing.p  pI have a tree data structure like thisp  precodeFoodContainer    FoodContainer    FoodContainer       Apple       Orange    FoodContainer    FoodContainer       FoodContainer          Banana codepre  pIts simply a recursive, treelike structure where objects can hold other objects etc..p  pThen I want to processes that structure to form another tree.  In this case I am building a scene graph for rendering in 3dp  precodeSceneGraph    SceneNode       SceneNode       SceneNode    SceneNode codepre  pThe structure of the scene graph is different to the original tree.p  pI decided to store these structures as a flat list rather than a tree data structure.  And so I implemented this ForEach method in the FoodContainer classp  precodepublic class FoodContainer     public int Id     public delegate void SearchDelegateint id     public void ForEachChildListltFoodContainergt flatList, SearchDelegate searchDelegate           Listltintgt idList  GetChildIdListthis.Id        foreach int id in idList                 searchDelegateid             codepre  pPlease ignore things Id not being a property etc., Im paraphrasing my real code.p  pNow before rendering I build the scene graph like thisp  precodepublic class Render     public SceneGraph BuildSceneGraphListltFoodContainergt flatList           SceneGraph sceneGraph  new SceneGraph        int rootNodeId  sceneGraph.CreateRootNode        FoodContainer rootContainer  flatList[0]  pretend the root is always at zero for this example         need to keep track of the current node as we recurse through. This        is the part I am struggling with.       int currentParentNodeId  rootNodeId        FoodContainer.SearchDelegate searchDelegate  delegateid                 FoodContainer foodContainer  flatList.GetByIdid           SceneNode newNode  new SceneNode          newNode.Id  SceneGraph.GetNextFreeId          newNode.Color  foodContainer.Color            add the new node to the scene graph under the current node          SceneNode parentNode  sceneGraph.GetNodeByIdcurrentParentNodeId           parentNode.AddnewNode            now build all child nodes for this node            update the current node so we know where to add the new children          currentParentNodeId  newNode.Id            recurse          foodContainer.ForEachChildflatList, searchDelegate                start the recursion       rootContainer.ForEachChildflatList, searchDelegate      codepre  pMy problem is, I dont really want to use the currentParentNodeId if I can help it, because it lies outside the delegate block.p  pI realize it is fine for a delegate to access variables that are outside their code block which I believe is what closures are all about, but I feel like the currentParentNodeId should be getting passed to my delegate.p  pI just feel confused about the design and am hoping someone could tell me what theyd do in this sort of situation.  The real application will be relying on this kind of code structure a lot because it is based entirely around these recursive structures.  The real program is a flowchartingtype of thing where each flowchart element can contain child elements similar to a UML design.p  pI am also using anonymous methods in the real program but I think it is not relevant to the question.p

Negative 506 pHey so I am just working on some coding homework for my Python class using JES. Our assignment is to take a sound, add some white noise to the background and to add an echo as well. There is a bit more exacts but I believe I am fine with that. There are four different functions that we are making a main, an echo equation based on a user defined length of time and amount of echos, a white noise generation function, and a function to merge the noises. p  pHere is what I have so far, havent started the merging or the main yet.p  precodeput the following line at the top of your file.

The current structure I have isp  blockquote   plocalhostapiv1resourcegetindex.phpp blockquote  pThe index file is the one with the code to connect to the database based on passed in parameters such as id3ampnamehello... Each table has its own get folder I was planning on doing the same for post, put, and delete.p  pIs the structure really not important, and do most solutions just use url rewrites to make them look like what they wantp  pSecond What is the best way to handle tables referencing each other. Right now I make it so that the user would have to precede the column name with the table, ex.p  blockquote   plocalhostapiv1resourcegetid3ampresource2.namehellop blockquote  pThis doesnt seem correct to me at all.p  pAnyone have any ideas I feel like I took a wrong turn and am going to start digging myself into a bigger hole.p  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 506 pI am trying to come up with a simple procedure for production deployments. I have 2 tomcat nodes, front ended by 2 apache nodes with a load balancer on top of apache nodes. For some reason I wont be able to do parallel deployments on Tomcats. I am trying to use balancermanager for during deployment in which I will make sure I drain tomcat node 1 before the application changes. I want to make sure I validate the changes on the tomcat node before I put the node in to live state. I know, at this point, I can take the apache node 1 offline from load balancer and change balancermanager to route requests only to tomcat node 1 and point all my requests to Apache node 1 to validate before I go live. I see this as a complex procedure to implement and I want to know if there is a better way I can achieve this.

Negative 506 pIve been working with modping on ejabberd, and could observe thisp  ul lipcodepingintervalcode Secondsbr How often to send pings to connected clients, if the previous option is enabled.

The default is to do nothing.pli ul  pFor now, I have the ping interval as 15 seconds. A smaller value would drain the battery of mobile clients, as has been observed.p  pSo, gauging a bit I changed the strongIQTIMEOUT value from 32 seconds to 5 secondsstrong a smaller value. This closes my connection with a relatively smaller wait now. This is a change in the wait time for receiving acknowledgement from the connected peer i.e. if the ack is not received within 5 seconds, the socket is closed by ejabberd now.p  pI am anxious if this impacts any other functionality of ejabberdp  pWhat are the drawbacks of setting up a small value such as 5 seconds in my casep

Negative 506 pIm trying to determine which style applies to an element by taking into account both inline and class styles. Javascript parses both of these into objects, but styles that are not set are empty strings, not codeundefinedcode.

Negative 506 pI am trying to do something whatsapp like for messages for having a cell that resizes based on contentsize and in the bottom right corner to have the date... the problem is that I dont know the rectangle position for the excluded path because the text is dynamic and I have something like this but works only for multiple lines, but not for a single linep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIjCiW.png altwhatsapp messages windowp  precodeNSString txtIm writing a text renderer using Core Text, and I discovered Ill need to wrap text around objects such as is done in any DTP program. I couldnt find any easy answers as to how to do this in the documentation, so having finally got it working Ill share what I did. To lay out text in a custom shape in Core Text, you can pass a CGPath in when you create your CTFramesetterRef. Originally this only supported rectangular paths, but now it supports fully custom paths. My first thought was to see if I could subtract the region to wrap around from the path for my frames border, and pass the result in to Core Text as a path. It turns out firstly that subtracting one path from another in Core Graphics is not trivial. However, if you simply add two shapes to the same path, Core Graphics can use a winding rule to work out which areas to draw. Core Text, at least as of iOS 4.2, can also use this kind of algorithm. This will work for many cases if you can guarantee that your object to be wrapped will be fully inside the frame and not overlapping the edge, just go ahead and add its border to the same path as your frame, and Core  Text will do the rest.  txtText.texttxt  CGSize textFrame  [txtText sizeThatFitsCGSizeMake235, MAXFLOAT]  UIBezierPath  imgRect  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectCGRectMaketextFrame.width35, textFrame.height20, 35, 20] txtText.textContainer.exclusionPaths  [imgRect]  textFrame  [txtText sizeThatFitsCGSizeMake235, MAXFLOAT]  int frameWidth375  txtText.frameCGRectIntegralCGRectMake10, 10, textFrame.width, textFrame.height lblHour.frameCGRectIntegralCGRectMaketextFrame.width35, textFrame.height15, 35, 20  viewCanvasAround.frameCGRectIntegralCGRectMake50, 100, textFrame.width20, textFrame.height20 codepre

These can be used to indicate when the corresponding VisualState needs to be applied automatically without an explicit GoToState call.

Negative 506 pWhat I  wish to know is how would I modify the below code to apply css to all objects with a specific class EXCEPT the object which triggered the hover event.p  precode .back.hover     function          this.findspan.show         this.findspan.slideDownslow      ,     function         this.findspan.css display, none         codepre  pSo at the moment the above code will apply css to the hovered object containing the class .back. Whereas I want the opposite, so apply css to all objects with the class .back except the one triggering the event.p  pNow I know it would go along the lines of analysing the current object being looped over, and if that object  to the object triggering the hover then apply the css. But I am unsure of the syntax.p  pIf this doesnt make sense, please dont hesitate to ask me to explain further.p  pThanks for any helpp  pCallump

Negative 506 pIt may seem to be an odd question, but really want to get rid of some doubts as to the strange situation Cygwin R is in. The official site a hrefhttpscran.rproject.orgdocmanualsrreleaseRadmin.htmlCygwin relnofollowR Installation and Administrationa says that Cygwin 64bit is completely not supported and that Cygwins BLAS library is flawed Do not use Cygwins BLAS library it is known to give incorrect results.. But the Cygwin package repository site a hrefhttpscygwin.compackagesx86R relnofollowCygwin R repository sitea keeps maintaining updated R even 64bit. According to my personal experience with Cygwin R v3.1.3 64bit, it seems that it works well, including the installed packages usually built from source without error. Given the fact that there are many people out there using Cygwin R at least there are a number of related questions on stackoverflow. Therefore I ask here whether Cygwin R should not be used for production, and if so why. Thanks in advance.  p
