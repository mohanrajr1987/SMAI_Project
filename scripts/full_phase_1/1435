Positive 1435 pI have two view controllers in my example project. In the main view controller, I have a container view. The container view is connected to the second view controller, i.e. xViewController.p  pThe image of view controller is at the link belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGn6kz.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comGn6kz.pngap  pWhen i clicked the button, I want to slide the label upwards.

Positive 1435 pI have a list of entries, which can be thought of as paragraphs from a book, stored as separate objects of the same class. These objects have a num property, along with the actual text, so that I know their order and can later display them in as a list in the correct order 1,2,3, .p  pNow I want to bring this one step further and be able to record the structure of the book, like the table of contents. In other words, say the book is divided into chapters, and each chapter is further divided into sections. The first few paragraphs are found under Ch.1 Sec.1, then Ch.1 Sec. 2, and so on all the way to Ch. n, S. m. What Im not sure of is whats a good way to record this information Ive been told that I should use a database with SQL but Im not sure where to begin.p  pThe implementation must allow me to quickly determine the following two things at any point 1 Given a chapter and section , what paragraphs are contained within this section 2 Given a paragraph , which chapter and section is it under It must also be flexible enough that I could use the same platform in the future with few edits if the structure depthwise of the book changes e.g. sections are divided into subsections, etc.. Finally, should be able to handle optional divisions i.e. some sections have subsections while others do not.p  pThis is for an iOS app and my code is written in ObjectiveC so far.p

Positive 1435 pWhat I basically want to do is drawing on an image using CoreGraphics and touches. For that the user chooses an image by using UIImagePickerController.

Positive 1435 pI have a codeUITableViewCellcode subclass that Im electing to set all positioning up in its codelayoutSubviewscode method. I have a special view Ive created essentially a view with a codeUILabelcode in it as a subview of this cell, and I want to position it correctly in codelayoutSubviewscode, but I cannot figure out how.p  pEvery other view I calculate what its position should be manually, and then call setFrame. This seems weird with this special view Ive created as its created from a nib and laid out using Auto Layout. But the cell itself doesnt use Auto Layout so Im unsure what to do.p  pConstraintwise the special view with the label in it just has the label positioned 15pt in from each size of the view its contained in. p  pIn codelayoutSubviewscode I want to essentially keep this logic that insets it intact, but make sure in terms of the cell that its positioned and sized properly within the cell. So essentially I want to keep the Auto Layout logic that keeps the label within the special view positioned intact, but allow me to position and size emthe whole view itselfem within the cell using codesetFramecode. Basically a view created from a nib with Auto Layout used inside a cell that elects not to use Auto Layout.p  pI tried basically calling codesizeThatFitsCGSizeZerocode to deduce what size it should be with Auto Layout, then position it, but it returns an absurdly large size that doesnt make sense. Even if I return a manually size, I get constraint conflict warnings in the console that one or more of my Auto Layout constraints for setting up the label within the cell will be ignored.p  pHow should I be doing this How should I make the views subviews respect its Auto Layout system, but allow me to position the cohesive view itself however I pleasep

Negative 1435 pLeading on from my previous questions I am going to try and clarify one of the problems I am facing.p  pI am trying to create a multiplayer version of PacMan. p  pA simple overview of how ive made my application is that I have a server which has a ServerSocket which is constantly listening on a specific port. Once a client connects it creates a thread in which all the transferring of data takes place. It first listens for the Direction in which the client wants to move and then sends the updates back to the client. On the client side its the reverse of this sending the direction and then waiting for the update to be received. This is done using ObjectOutputInput Streams. There is also a game class which has all the game logic and this has the game loop which each looping calls each of the connected players serverThread.exchangeDatas method.p  pMy game works ok with one client connected but as soon as another client joins locally is all that ive tested, but this should work right It crashed my game in the Server thread producing the following error   java.io.StreamCorruptedException invalid type code 00.p  pIs the code that trips this exceptionp  precode        Object o  in.readObject         if o instanceof Direction                       Get new location             player.setDirectionDirection o         System.out.printlnGot   Directiono   new location   player.getNextLocation                    Send gameState          System.out.printlnSending data         Data data  new Datagame.getGameState, game.getScared, game.getScareLeft, player.getLives, player.getScore         out.flush         out.writeObjectdata         out.flush         out.reset codepre  pa hrefhttppastebin.comm1e8de96b relnofollowServer codeap  pa hrefhttppastebin.comm459b43 relnofollowServerThread code the one that crashes in the exchangeData methodap  pa hrefhttppastebin.comm60c82176 relnofollowClient Controller codeap  pa hrefhttppastebin.comm79a9a07 relnofollowGame loop code  line 42 is what calls the exchange data methodap  pAny help would be amazing with these.p  pa hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload.phpnwwqmzywfom relnofollowhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload.phpnwwqmzywfomap  pheres a download to both the client and the server they are netbeans projectsp  pSorry for my messy code [p

While my test is running, Im capturing an SQL Profiler trace which I load in to an SQL table when the test has finished so I can analyse the stats.p  pThe first test run after recreating a different set of indexes on the table is very noticeably slower than subsequent runs  typically about 1015 times slower for the inserts on this table on the first run after the index creation.p  pEach time, I clear the data and execution plan cache before the test.p  pWhat I want to know, is the reason for this initial poorer performance with a newly created set of indexes Is there a way I can monitor what is happening to cause this for the first runp
Negative 1435 pIm working on a site with HTMLCSSjQuery that is trying to act like a Flash site. Ive had to use fontface to get the desired font to work. The client wants the fade in of text and content too so it looks like the Flash file. The problem is, the fonts look jagged and ugly in Internet Explorer.p  pMy CSS for the font face looks like thisp  precodefontface  fontfamily SansumiRegular src url..fontsSansumiBold.eot src localSansumi Regular, localSansumiBold, url..fontsSansumiBold.ttf formattruetype codepre  p...which is generated from a hrefhttpwww.fontsquirrel.comfontfacegenerator relnofollowhttpwww.fontsquirrel.comfontfacegeneratorap  pThe jQuery for the fade in stuff is like thisp  precodesite.cssopacity 0.0 ... preloads the images with jQuery, and at callback do fade... site.animateopacity 1.0, 1000 codepre  pBasically, there is no way around the fact that I need to use that particular font not standard web font and I have to use some sort of fade technique for it to look like the Flash file.p  pThis all looks great in Firefox, Safari, Chrome... But in IE it looks rubbish  all jagged and hardly unreadable. After looking around, I found this jQuery plugin that is meant to deal with ClearType issues in IE a hrefhttpallcreatives.net20091205jquerypluginiefontfacecleartypefix relnofollowhttpallcreatives.net20091205jquerypluginiefontfacecleartypefixap  p...but I have a feeling its this fade in thats causing the problem with the fonts. Maybe its the fact that IE doesnt really support the opacity CSS command ...but it does fade in fine one all IEs Ive even tried a relatively unknown technique of applying a opaque background color like FFFFFF to the elements with the text in that fades, but this still doesnt seem to do anything.p  pThere must be away around this problem Apart from this small font issue, the site is completep

Negative 1435 pThe other day I was implementing an important service in my application, that should continue to run no matter what.

But in reality, especially in case of RuntimeException, truth is that they are thrown quite common in production deployment, and I feel it is almost always desirable that while that particular operation should fail, the app itself should not fail because of that isolated error.  p  pIt is true that a suppression of one periodic task does not affect other kinds of periodic tasks. But given the nature of most periodic tasks, shouldnt these tasks perceived as a service, rather than isolated tasks  p  pIn other words, shouldnt only that one instance of codeimportantPeriodicTaskcode fail, and the task itself be continued to be rescheduledp

Negative 1435 pIm currently extending an image library used to categorize images and i want to find duplicate images, transformed images, and images that contain or are contained in other images.br I have tested the SIFT implementation from OpenCV and it works very well but would be rather slow for multiple images.

This would probably be fast, but very memory intensive.

Negative 1435 pIm trying to put together a zip streaming solution through the use of Unixs zip command and PHPs passthru function, but Ive hit a snag.p  pThe script looks something like thisp  precodeltphp headerContentType applicationoctetstream headerContentDisposition attachement filenamemyfile.zip passthruzip r 0  stufftozip exit gt codepre  pThe zip command works OK and the output is received by the browser and saved as a zip file. The zip can then be extracted fine on Windows and Unix, but on Mac OS X the build in extractor BOMArchiveHelper cant extract the file. Using other applications on OS X works fine though.p  pThe error given by BOMArchiveHelper is the same it gives if a zip is password protected not handled by the application. I used some kind of zip analyzer program and it indicated that some of the files in the zip archive were flagged as password protected. Like I said though, no other extraction application pays attention to that apparently.p  pWhen examening the zip closer I found that the one generated by the PHP files is a few bytes larger than one generated directly by the zip command on the server. It seems that the stream process with passthru adds something to the file that probably causes the problems with BOMArchiveHelper.p  pTo test this, I used passthru to stream a zip I had already created on the server passthrucat stuff.zip That worked fine with BOMArchiveHelper.p  pSo the problem seems to lie somewhere in the process where the passthru function takes the binary data generated on the fly by the zip command and passes that to the browser.p  pIve tried to eliminate all the sources where the extra bytes could be generated setting zip command to quiet and so on, but the added data still remains. A binary diff of the streamed zip and a pre generated zip shows that the extra data is scattered all over the zip, not just in the end or the beginning.p  pAnyone have a clue, or seen this problem before and decided its impossible to solve p  pNB Since someone else has already encountered and very well described this issue before me without any answer I just copiedpaste his message here and made sure that all his tests did effectively fail and neither any of mine passed ...p  pApparently the only way to get this to work would be to ask people to use either unzip or suffitexpander ...p

Negative 1435 pemSOLVED Inside my classs constructor, I had a Semaphores construction racing with a Threads construction, where I wanted the Semaphore to be created first and the Thread second.  The solution that worked for me was to create the Semaphore first in a base class, that way I can depend on it in my derived class. emp  pI have a fairly small pthreads C program which works fine under normal conditions.  However, when using valgrinds thread error checking tools on the program, it appears to uncover a race condition.  What makes this race condition particularly difficult to avoid is that it is happening inside a Semaphore class which really just encapsulates seminit, semwait, and sempost, so I cant fix this with another Semaphore and shouldnt have to.  I dont think valgrind is giving a false positive since my program shows different behavior when running under valgrind.p  pHeres Semaphore.cpp  p  pre include Semaphore.h include ltstdexcept include lterrno.h include ltiostream  SemaphoreSemaphorebool pshared,int initial     mSemnew semt    ifmSem0     throw stdruntimeerrorSemaphore constructor error mSem  0   ifseminitmSem,pshared10,initial1     throw stdruntimeerrorseminit failed   SemaphoreSemaphore      semdestroymSem     delete mSem  void Semaphorelock    ifmSem0     throw stdruntimeerrorSemaphorelock error mSem  0    int rc   for     rc  semwaitmSem     ifrc0 break     iferrnoEINTR continue     throw stdruntimeerrorsemwait failed     void Semaphoreunlock    ifsempostmSem0     throw stdruntimeerrorsempost failed  pre  ul liNotice how Semaphores constructor creates a new semt named mSem, and throws an exception in the extremelyunlikely scenario that mSem still equals 0.  This just means it should be impossible for this constructor to allow mSem to equal 0.  Well...move on to Semaphorelock regardless of what thread this function is called from as well as the constructor, it shouldtheoreticallystill be impossible for mSem to be 0, right  Well, when I run my program under helgrind, Semaphorelock, sure enough, ends up throwing this exception Semaphorelock error mSem0 which I really thought should be impossible.li ul  pI have used this Semaphore class in other programs which pass helgrind with no problems, and Im really not sure what Im doing special here that is causing the issue.  According to helgrind, the race is happening between a write in Semaphores constructor in one thread and a read in Semaphorelock in another thread.  Honestly, I dont even see how thats possible how can a method of an object have a race condition with the constructor of that object Doesnt C guarantee that the constructor has been called before its possible to invoke a method on an object How can this ever be violated, even in a multithreaded environment  p  pAnyway, now for the valgrind output.

Negative 1435 pThis function generates simple .dot files for visualizing automata transition functions using Graphviz.

E.g., when I print codeunlines  prepGraphcode to a file, I get things likep  precode0 gt 1 [ label  a, N. SF ] codepre  pinstead ofp  precode0 gt 1 [ label  a, N. SF ] codepre  pHowever, Null seems to work fine, and outputs perfectly well. Now of course the string N. SF isnt the actual form I use to store inflections, but that form does include a String or two. So how can I tell Haskell when you codeshowcode a String values, dont doublequote itp

Negative 1435 pI have a slider that I need to change the tabindex to 1 on.

Inside that color box is a form separated into slides on a coda slider.   The forms elements I have all set to a 1 tab index but one of the form questions has a Jquery UI slider element to allow the person set their height.  p  pThe element itself is an anchor tag with the class uisliderhandle but its created after the page load so I cant just do simple jQuery.  I tried using the .live function but it wants an eventtype.  I dont want it to be based on an event other than just when its created.  Unless you think Keydown would work as the main objective is to stop users from pressing tab and moving the slider the form is contained within without using the sliders navigation of next and previous.p  pI understand this is confusing as to why someone would set a site up like this but it was before I entered the picture.  Any help would be greatly appreciated  Thanks in advancep

Negative 1435 pExactly how skinny should a controller be I understand putting all of the business logic inside the models, but what about other things.p  pFor example, say I was writing a blog site where each user can have multiple posts.

Negative 1435 pIm just starting off on my first attempt at the a hrefhttpcode.google.comwebtoolkitdoclatestDevGuideMvpActivitiesAndPlaces.html relnofollowMVPa architecture in a hrefhttpcode.google.comwebtoolkit relnofollowGWTa.p  pMy understanding is that the job of codePlaceTokenizer.getPlaceStringcode is to take the token in the URL after the hash, parse it, and return a codePlacecode with the object to which that token refers.p  pIn my application, I have a resource say, a video, which I tokenize by the videos unique id. Then my codegetPlacecode method ought to take this id, and retrieve the video information from the server. Is this the right approachp  pAs far as how to execute this, the only way that I could figure out would be to have my codeRemoteServicecode right on the codePlaceTokenizercode, and make the call right in that codegetPlacecode method. Something about this made me hesitate. It seems like the call would be better suited for the codeActivitycode or somewhere else.p  pIs this how its done If not, is there a better wayp

Negative 1435 pI have a widget that simply uses a service to update the looks of a widgets RemoteViews.  The service is started based on filters supplied by a different registered BroadcastReceiver.  When one of the criteria are met, the onReceive of my BroadcastReceiver is called and I start my service.  The service runs and then stops itself.  This works great for a while.  However, after a while it is as if the BroadcastReceiver is killed.  I have seen in the logs where my process has died, and it restarts my service in 5000 ms.  This is great, but the problem is that my BroadcastReceiver is what actually controls the starting of the service based on my subscribed events.  Without it, my service is not started when those events occur, such as the users screen on.  Any idea why this would happen Why would the BroadcastReceiver stop receiving events when the unRegister has not been called I dont want my service to be up and running at all times.  I suspect the same behavior would occur if I used the service itself as the BroadcastReceiver.

Negative 1435 pIm wondering is there a way to overwrite Hashtable or Dictionary class so it would automatically do boxingunboxing operations on objects.

Settings might have different types of values, such as lets say HowManyItemsToDisplay would have some integer value, while NameOfSomeControl would be a string. Therefore it would be nice to avoid any casting when writing something like imyControl.Text  MySettings[SomeTextValue]i or iwhile MySettings[SomeIntValue]  0  .. ip

Negative 1435 pIm working on a script for a piece of software, and it doesnt really give me direct access to the data I need. Instead, I need to ask for each piece of information I need, and build a list of the data Im getting. For various reasons, I need the list to be sorted. Its very easy to just build the list once, and then sort it, followed by doing stuff with it. However, I assume it would be faster to run through everything emonceem, rather than build the list and then sort it.p  pSo, at the moment Ive basically got thisp  precodemylist  []  for item in query for stuff     mylist.appendquery for s data  item  mylist.sort  dostuffmylist codepre  pThe query for stuff bit is the query interface with the software, which will give me an iterable. mylist needs to contain a list of data from the contents of said iterable. By doing it like this, Im querying for the first list, then looping over it to extract the data and put it into mylist. Then Im sorting it. Lastly, Im doing stuff to it with the dostuff method, which will loop over it and do stuff to each item.p  pThe problem is that I cant dostuff to it before its sorted, as the list order is important for various reasons. I dont think I can get away from having to loop over lists twice  once to build the list and once to do stuff to each item in it, as we wont know in advance if a recently added item at position N will stay at position N after weve added the next item  but it seems cleaner to insert each item in a sorted fashion, rather than just appending them at the end.

Negative 1435 pI a slight situation here. What happens is that the user opens the grid of buttons by clicking on the open grid link and depending on the button selected it would display the buttons below then Number of Answers text box. E.g if user clicks on button 1 it displays button A, if chose button 2 then shows buttons A and B and etc.p  pNow this does work until I type in a number in the Number of Answers textbox, then if I select a button from the open grid menu, then it would not change the buttons display below the text box. p  pSo lets say for example there is a number in the number of answers textbox and I change the button from button 1 to button 3 from the open grid menu, then it should display buttons A, B and C but because there is a number in the number of answers textbox it would not change the buttons below the textbox and it will still display only button A.p  pWhy is it doing thisp  pCode is in jsfiddle, click a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpSy9710 relnofollow hereap

Negative 1435 pI need to select specific values in a dataset in R and cant figure out how to actually do it.p  pAs a sidenote What does the data representp  pThis is a measurement of a network node connecting to three other nodes. time represents a relative time, when did something happen. tm1,tm2,tm3 shows in which protocol state the connection is currently. known is the absolute number of nodes which should be connected. here max 3p  pFirst of all some test data as csvp  precodetime,tm1,tm2,tm3,known 4,1,0,0,1 12,2,0,0,2 206,3,0,0,3 238,2,1,0,3 255,1,2,0,3 297,1,1,1,3 309,1,0,2,3 401,0,1,2,3 446,0,0,3,3 3,1,0,0,1 58,2,0,0,2 235,1,1,0,2 258,1,0,1,2 320,0,1,1,2 335,0,0,2,2 874,1,0,2,3 1024,0,1,2,3 1030,0,0,3,3 3,1,0,0,1 20,2,0,0,2 132,1,1,0,2 151,1,0,1,2 207,0,1,1,2 228,0,0,2,2 852,1,0,2,3 929,0,1,2,3 938,0,0,3,3 codepre  pEach line means something has changed in the system, but I have to filter this data. E.g one frame isp  precodetime,tm1,tm2,tm3,known  3,1,0,0,1  lt ignore 20,2,0,0,2  lt ignore 132,1,1,0,2 lt ignore 151,1,0,1,2 lt select  first appearance of 1 in tm3 207,0,1,1,2 lt ignore 228,0,0,2,2 lt select  first appearance of 2 in tm3 852,1,0,2,3 lt ignore 929,0,1,2,3 lt ignore 938,0,0,3,3 lt select  first appearance of 3 in tm3 codepre  pThe selected data contains always 3 interesting entries and each frame holds 9 lines, this is true for all so called frames you can notice that when the time jumps to a lesser value in the csv datap  pMaybe I need to plot more data, but this gets even more complicated and Im not sure how I can plot such a state machine correctly. Running with 3 nodes is surely manageable with conditions, but as soon as I need to do that for lets say 6 Nodes, this runs surely out of hand. Im relative new in R and so Im not sure if R is the right decision, I just wanted to quickly plot some measurement data and therefor R fits perfectly.  But how much work is it to plot such state machines in R properly, I think I cannot invest so much time in it and just run with simple data plotting.p  pUnfortunately, I cannot estimate how complicated it will get. Maybe someone can enlighten me or did already visualize a state machine and has some tips how to do it.p  pA bit more detail on visualizing the statesp  pSuggest there are 3 nodes in a network, which should be connected. So each line represents actually a change in the network connection state.p  pThe protocol which is executed consists of three protocol stages, which needs to be executed for a connection.p  pSo e.g. a line likep  precode4,1,0,0,1 codepre  pmeans, there was a message received from a node, now proceed in the protocol. A following line is thenp  precode100,0,1,0,1 codepre  pIf this stage succeeds, the next protocol stage happensp  precode200,0,0,1,1 codepre  pIf we reach this state, the other node is authenticated, verified and connected. As you can see in my example data, these messages appear not in any ordered ways. Although there is never a transition betweenp  precode4,1,0,0,1 codepre  pdirectly top  precode200,0,0,1,1 codepre  pmessages from other nodes can appear in between any other message.p  pThe interesting part of this is actually not the visualization, but the time it takes for each protocol stage transition. This is the data I actually need to get.p  pAs I write this, I think with the actual data it is not possible to visualize this with  the current information.p  pAn easy way could be, introduce an unique identifier for each node and sort the list based on identifier and time. Then we automatically get a somewhat ordered list, because no protocol stage can be jumped over for a single node, so it is ordered correctly based on time. Because there are fixed entries for each node itself these data could be easily calculated and visualized, I guess.p  pI currently see no other way, the problem is, this data is not so easily achievable, but if I need to visualize it, it seems i cannot get over the unique identifiers.p

Negative 1435 pI dont think this is a new issue. But it seems that there is an error that comes up whenever an orderedunordered list in JTextPane EditorKit  HTMLEditorKit, Document  HTMLDocument is deleted from all the way down to the top using the backspace key. The following is the exception thrown from the getText  method of GlyphView. p  precodeException in thread AWTEventQueue0 javax.swing.text.StateInvariantError GlyphView Stale view javax.swing.text.BadLocationException Invalid location codepre  pI can provide a SSCCE for this. But it is not very difficult to simulate. Just use a JTextPane with HTMLEditorKit and HTMLDOcument model set inside it. Either use the custom InsertOrderedList action or have some way to insert the string p  precodeltHTMLgtltHEADgtltHEADgtltBODYgtltULgtltLIgtltLIgtltULgtltBODYgtltHTMLgt codepre  pwhich will result in the insertion of an orderedunordered list inside the text pane.p  pThe weird parts of this bug are as followsp  ol lipOnce you start deleting the characters and if you happen to have lines below the bulleted list, the characters will get deleted until you hit the last character of the last bullet item. Once you reach this, the caret just refuses to move up and the error from GlyphView gets thrown.pli lipSometimes what happens is that after you have deleted most of the characters  you still wont be able to delete the first bullet of the list. It just hangs on until you do a ctrla and then backspace.pli ol  pI have seen these bugs in almost all Java based HTML editors available online except for JWebEngine, where this behavior is not present. Unfortunately JWebEngine is not open sourced and hence I cant take a peek inside their code to see as to how they have solved this problem.p  pMy guess is that the notification that is coming from the HTML document model has some problem due to which the cursor positioning code is not working correctly. I have also searched the Sun bugs database to check if this particular issue has been raised but could not find any though I have seen quite a few bugs which are very similar to this. Also I am very sure that someone must have noticed this before and must have brought it to the Swing teams attention.p  pDoes anyone working with Swing particularly text part know as to if this issue has been raised with Sun or if there is any known workaround that has been found to mitigate the problem p  pThough it is possible that the user is still able to delete the lists from the pane using the mouse selection, not having the option to do the same using the backspace key just seems very weird.p  pSSCCE is now attached. To repro the bug pls. follow the steps as shown in the attached fig.p  ol liAdd a line of text. Then add 23 bullet items by clicking on the button above the text pane. Now place the caret at the end of the last char of the last bullet and keep on pressing the entire backspace key until all the chars get deleted.li ol  pObserved behavior the last bullet will hang on wont get deleted and the exception will be thrown as mentioned abovep  pExpected No exception and the contents of the text pane should get cleared.p  precodepublic class Test      static final JFrame frame  new JFrame      static final JTextPane textPane  new JTextPane       static EditorKit kit     static JButton listButton      public static void createAndShowGUI           Create frame         frame.setSize400, 600         frame.setVisibletrue         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setLayoutnull          Customize text pane visual properties         textPane.setSize300, 500         textPane.setLocation50, 50          customize text pane non visual properties         kit  new CustomEditorKit          textPane.setEditorKitForContentTypetexthtml, kit         textPane.setContentTypetexthtml          Action[] actions  HTMLEditorKit kit.getActions         Action action  null         for int i  0 i lt actions.length i              action  actions [i]             if action.getValueAction.NAME.equalsInsertUnorderedList                  break                               listButton  new JButton action         listButton.setTextList         listButton.setSize100, 20         listButton.setLocation100, 10         listButton.setVisibletrue           Add button and text pane to frame          frame.addlistButton         frame.addtextPane           public static void mainString[] args          try              EventQueue.invokeAndWaitnew Runnable                   Override                 public void run                      createAndShowGUI                                         catch InterruptedException e              e.printStackTrace          catch InvocationTargetException e              e.printStackTrace                    static class CustomEditorKit extends HTMLEditorKit          Override         public Document createDefaultDocument               return new HTMLDocument this.getStyleSheet                codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb7XFw.png altTextPane bullet deletion problemp

Negative 1435 pI want to create a window function that will count how many times the value of the field in the current row appears in the part of the ordered partition coming embeforeem the current row. To make this more concrete, suppose we have a table like so p  precode id fruit   date    1  apple     1    1  cherry    2    1  apple     3    1  cherry    4    2  orange    1    2  grape     2    2  grape     3   codepre  pAnd we want to create a table like so omitting the date column for clarity p  precode id fruit   prior      1  apple     0     1  cherry    0     1  apple     1     1  cherry    1     2  orange    0     2  grape     0     2  grape     1    codepre  pNote that for codeid  1code, moving along the ordered partition, the first entry apple doesnt match anything since the implied set is empty, the next fruit, cherry also doesnt match.

Negative 1435 pIm working in a CC mixed project that has the following situation.p  pI need to have a iteration to go through very small chunks rarely larger chunks as well in a file one by one. Ideally, I should just read them once consecutively.  I think will be a better solution in this case to read a big chunk into a buffer and consume it later, rather than read each of them instantly when I need.p  pThe problem is, how do I balance the cache size  Is there any wellknown algorithmlibrary that I can take advantage ofp  hr  pUPDATE changes the titlep  pThanks for you guys replies and I understand there are different levels of caching mechanism working in our boxes.

Negative 1435 pIm pretty new to Java so sorry if this is super basic.  Basically I have some data in a array list and it works fine but in a later part of my program I need to read the list and it takes a long time because the list becomes very large.  So I thought I could take certain parts of the array listthats needed later into a hash map that I can extract that section of the array list later fromhopefully that makes sense.p  pI first create the array list with all the data I wantI have a loop and call each data thats created in a single loop datacachelocalloopp  precodeHashMap hashmapofvalues  new HashMap hashmap of arraylist for int i  0 ilt100 i  ....program logic and more loops Set uniqieTcache  new HashSetTcachelocalloop make values unique hashmapofvalues.puti, new ArrayListuniqieTcache  codepre  pThen later on when I need the data I extract it like thisp  precodeList t  new ArrayList t.addhashmapofvalues.geti codepre  pBut my program fails and Im not sure exactly why.  When I print out the size of hashmapofvalues I get the number of is Im expecting but when I print out the number of T it only shows onewhen I run the program it says Tcachelocalloop has hundreds of items.p  pCan anyone suggest to me what Im doing wrong  Im not 100 but I think I maybe looking at the array list I add as a single item but Im unsure of what Im doing wrong.p

Negative 1435 h2Contexth2  pIm currently developing a tool for managing orders and communicating between technicians and services. The industrial context is broadcast and TV. Multiple clients expecting media files each made to their own specs imply widely varying workflows even within the restricted scope of a single clients orders.p  pOne client can ask one day for a single SD file and the next for a fullblown HD package containing up to fourteen files... In a MySQL db I am trying to store accurate information about all the small tasks composing the workflow, in multiple formsp  ul liDATETIME values every time a task is accomplished, for accurate trackingli lipaths to the newly created files in the companys file system in VARCHARsli liarchiving background info in TEXT values info such as user comments, e.g. when an incident happens and prevents moving forward, they can comment about it in this feedli ul  pMultiply that by 30 different file types and this is way too much for a single table. So I thought Id break it up by client one table per client so that any order only ever requires the use of that one table that doesnt manipulate more than 15 fields. Still, this a pretty rigid solution when a client has 9 different transcoding specs and that a particular order only requires one. I figure Id need to add flags fields for each transcoding field to indicate which ones are required for that particular order.p  h2Concepth2  pI then had this crazy idea that maybe I could create a temporary table to last while the order is running that can range from about 1 day to 1 month. We rarely have more than 25 orders running simultaneously so it wouldnt get too crowded.p  pThe idea is to make a table tailored for each order, eliminating the need for flags and unnecessary forever empty fields. Once the order is complete the table would get flushed, JSONencoded, into a TEXT or BLOB so it can be restored later if changes need made.p  pDo you have experience with DBMSs MySQL in particular struggling from such practices if it has ever existed Does this sound like a viable option I am happy to try which I already started and I am seeking advice so as to keep going or stop right here.p  pThanks for your inputp

Negative 1435 pImagine you have a typical producerconsumer pattern in Java. To be a bit more efficient you want to use codenotifycode and not codenotifyAllcode when a new element is added to the queue. If two producer threads invoke notify, is it guaranteed that two distinct waiting consumer threads will be awoken Or can it be that two codenotifycodes fired shortly after each other cause the same comsumer thread to be queued for wakeup twice I cant find the section is the API describing how this exactly works. Does java have some atomic internal operation for waking up threads exactly oncep  pIf only one comsumer is waiting then the second notify would be lost, that is no problem. p

Negative 1435 pSo ive been doing some iphone development with some OpenglES in it, but i am getting a rather weird error when i call prepareToDraw on my effect. My program in short simulates dice rolling trying to learn objectivec and opengl. The program works fine for the most part, i can use everything ive programmed my app to do with its bugs in the physics but ill fix that later. The problem comes in after ive used the part that contains the OpenGL. p  pThe program contains 2 menus you have to go through in order to reach the screen that is using OpenGL, once you have used the apps OpenGL part and go back to the previous menu, then try go back to the OpenGL part again, i get a print out saying GL ERROR 0x0501. ive narrowed it down to be caused by the prepareToDraw method from my effect. The other weird part about it, is if i go back, then forward again, the OpenGL works again, and can be repeated again and again for it to be working and breaking every second time you go into the OpenGL part.p  pIve been searching around for similar problems to mine, but each time its got something to do with loading textures that are not a poweroftwo texture, which doesnt help me because im not even using textures yet, just colored vertices.p  pive pastebind my two code files where the problem should liep  pDice.m a hrefhttppastebin.comze1DEEzs relnofollowhttppastebin.comze1DEEzsa in the draw method youll see my printouts have narrowed down where the problem lies, which is the prepareToDraw method. line 308p  pRollViewController.m a hrefhttppastebin.comVycwAh3R relnofollowhttppastebin.comVycwAh3Ra this file is where i setup the effect and the context etc, so i must be doing something wrong in here to cause the prepareToDraw method to mess up every 2nd time i run the OpenGL part of the program. i have a feeling it has something to do with not letting go some kind of resource to do with the context and the effect, but i cant find anything about deleting context and effect probably because you dont need to but im not sure.p  pI hope there is someone out there that has run into the same problem and can answer my question and i hope its not just a silly mistake because ive been trying to solve this for a while now p  pthanksp

Negative 1435 pIm new to Android programming, so Im facing some general problems about choosing the best way to design my app.p  pWhat I want to do is basically a media player. I want the media player to run on a service because I want it to play also when the activity is not displayed. p  pMy question is, how can I update the UI on my activity depending on the service working flow  for example, the song changes and I want its name to be displayedp  pI guess I could use a Local Broadcast Manager in order to send intents from my service to my activity and invoke UI updates does it seem rightp  pBUT... I will want my service to do some stuff while playing music like queryingupdating the DB.  For this reason I was thinking on running the service on a different process or thread.p  pSO.. I guess, running service on a different process, I wont be able to use local broadcast manager is this right.p  pI hope I explained what are my doubts... anyone can helpp  pthanks a lotp

Negative 1435 pIs there a sure way to programmatically differentiate between multiple cameras I enumerate CLSIDVideoInputDeviceCategory and then I GetDisplayName on each IMoniker.

Negative 1435 pIm encountering a problem where some simple Cocoa bindings are altering a fetch predicate attached to an ArrayController that has Auto Rearrange Content set.p  pMy data model has three classes well call them A, B, and C. Its arranged in a strict hierarchy, where an instance of classA owns one or more instances of classB, each of which owns one or more instances of classC and each instance of classes B and C has a weak reference to its parent. For examplep  precodeinterface ClassA property strong NSArray collectionofb property BOOL foo end  interface ClassB property weak ClassA classA property strong NSArray collectionofc property weak SomeOtherClass bar end  interface ClassC property weak ClassB classB property weak SomeOtherClass baz end codepre  pIm showing this hierarchy in a large masterdetail view. Theres a first table view with a list of all classA instances upon selection, a second table view presents the list of classB instances and upon selection again, a third table view presents the list of classC instances.p  pBeneath each list, theres a set of fields bound to various properties of the selected instance of classA, classB, or classC like foo, bar, and baz. These fields either use strictly KVOcompliant accessors to modify the class members, or Im just binding the field straight to the selection member. For example, classA.foo is bound to a set of radio buttons for YES and NO. All of that seems to be working perfectly.p  pNow, heres the kicker. In another part of the same window, Im presenting a filtered list of classC instances having some properties. To present that filtered list, Im using a filter predicate specifying some criteria like classB.bar  some value OR classB.classA.foo  YES. The filtering works perfectly... until I alter the values of foo or bar through the bound fields, when my app instantly crashes with the following messagep  pCannot remove an observer for the key path bar from ltClassB instancegt, most likely because the value for the key bar has changed without an appropriate KVO notification being sent. Check the KVOcompliance of the ClassB class.p  pIve narrowed the problem down to the Auto Rearrange Content setting of the ArrayController. When I turn this off, the table doesnt automatically adjust the content when the filtered properties of the instances change, but it also doesnt crash. Of course, I can manually trigger the rearranging, but its an inelegant solution.p  pSome searching revealed a 2009 cocoadev thread reporting the exact same behavior of Auto Arrange Content as a bugp  pa hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumhlenampfromgroupstopiccocoadevSpXF0B4dE relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumhlenampfromgroupstopiccocoadevSpXF0B4dEap  pNot sure what can be done about it, though. Any thoughtsp

Negative 1435 pApologies if this has been resolved elsewhere.  I searched and searched.p  pIm working with a config file that separates chunks of data by leftaligning the name of each chunk and indenting arguments for each name see codeDATAcode below.  Ive written a script that stores each chunk into a hash having a codehashnamecode key pointed at a scalar value, and a codehashargscode key pointed at an array of values.  As each chunk is stored into its own hash, a reference to the hash is stored anonymously in an array.  Eventually Id like to grab these hashes one by one and process the values in them but Im having trouble iterating through the array.p  pWhen I try to print the values stored in each hash it seems to be taking the hash refs in that array in list context, so if hashargs was a reference to an array having three elements, thats three more times the foreach loop runs.  p  pHow do I get the code in that loop to just run once for each hash reference Ive socked away into that arrayp  pIf you check my output its clear that the nested array reference needs to be dereferenced but Im so stuck on getting the loop right that I havent been able to tackle that yet.

Negative 1435 pSo Im making a text editor using Qt and right now I have a button that opens a dialog called Format text.

Right now I have it working where you can select the font style, font color, and font size and hit preview and it shows you in a box in the dialog what your text will look like. However, I have a button called okay which is supposed to change the highlighted text or the text you are about to type, but I cant figure out how to display those changes on the main window. The .ui files are private and a lot of the already made functions and pointers are the same in every ui file so if I change the ui file to pubic I have to change a whole bunch of things. Can anyway give me a simple answer Im trying to do this with as little confusion as possible. More coding and less confusion is better than less coding and more confusion for someone of my skill level.

Negative 1435 pI am exploring the use of a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgDesignIssuesMatrixURIs.html relnofollowMatrixURIsa in a JAXRS application. In the process Ive noticed that the a hrefhttpjsr311.java.netnonavreleases1.1javaxwsrsMatrixParam.html relnofollowMatrixParama annotated parameters seem to only get the matrix parameters from the final segment which makes trying to use a hrefhttpjersey.java.netnonavdocumentation1.15userguide.htmld4e374 relnofollowsubresource locatorsa a bit painful. I would like to know if this is a bug, or is part of the spec and why, or is simply an undefined crack. p  pI know that I likely could devise a way to use the Context injected a hrefhttpjsr311.java.netnonavreleases1.1javaxwsrscoreUriInfo.html relnofollowUriInfoa object which does change depending upon where in the locator chain one finds oneself, but this feels ugly.p  pThumbing quickly through the a hrefhttpjcp.orgaboutJavacommunityprocessmreljsr311index.html relnofollowJAXRS 1.1 speca... the closest I could find to this not being supported was around 3.2 p  blockquote   pBecause injection occurs at object creation time, use of these annotations with the exception of Context on resource class fields and bean properties is only supported for the default perrequest resource class lifecycle.p blockquote  pBut thats talking about ConstructorField injection, not method parameters like in 3.3.2 p  blockquote   pWhen a resource method is invoked, parameters annotated with FormParam or one of the annotations listed in section 3.2 are mapped from the request according to the semantics of the annotation.p blockquote  pBut of course the semantics of the annotation are seemingly vague. p  h1Runtime Environment Detailsh1  ul liJersey 1.13, 1.15li liTomcat 7.0.29li liJava 1.6.031 Appleli liMacOS X 10.7.5li ul  h1Example resourcesh1  precodepublic

Negative 1435 pI am developing a custom imagemap type map without geo referencing i.e. latlng of my map do not relate to acutal latlng of that place. Now i have also created custom streetview panoramas of certain buildings and places in that map. p  pThe issue is am not able to integrate those custom streetview panoramas with my custom imagemap.p  pFollowing is the link to see whats going onp  pa hrefhttpcdi.astateweb.orgvirtualtour relnofollowhttpcdi.astateweb.orgvirtualtourap  pFirst Approach There are two markers on the map right now. When you click on them a small infobubble pops up. Now when you click on the virtual tour link a dialog comes up. I want to load the custom streetview panorama in that dialog. I tried several things but to no avail. I am trying to reuse the same dialog for both markers. I tried initializing the panorama in jquery ui dialog open function. It worked for the first one but when you close the dialog and open it again it fails with some cbk error from google apis.p  pSECOND APPROACH I tried to use the default streetview pegman such that when the pegman is dropped on a certain building or place which has a panorama the streetview comes up just like in normal google maps. This didnt work either.p  pCan somebody point me to the right direction. Any help will be highly appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 1435 pHere is my code for my logic, it plays two teams against eachother using random values as pitch and hittingskills etc. I want to represent each pitch within my applet, so it updates each pitch.

Negative 1435 pI have an anonymous class that needs to be initialized before the trait that it mixes in.  Early initialization wont work because they dont allow one to use the this reference.  I can make it work if I declare the class as an inner trait with a self type, but this seems unnecessarily verbose, as the type is only used in one place in the code and is inuitive to be inlined as an anonymous class.  However, I seem to find the syntax that scala will accept and meets the initialization order requirements that I have.  Here is a simplified example without the extraneous detail assume there are reasons Im doing things this way.p  precodetrait WaitCondition[T]  ...   trait EventWaitCondition[T] extends WaitCondition[T]  ...   trait Event  outer gt     private[this] var cachedWaitCondition  Option[WaitCondition[T]]      def next  WaitCondition[T]          Is there a way to inline the defintion of NextWaitCondition         without screwing up the initialization order         cachedWaitCondition.getOrElse new NextWaitCondition with EventWaitCondition[T]       private[this] trait NextWaitCondition  this  WaitCondition[T] gt         outer.cache  Somethis         ....          ....  codepre  pSo, basically, my question is that is there a way to inline the definition of NextWaitCondition as an anonymous type without changing the initialization order between NextWaitCondition and WaitCondition i.e., so that NextWaitCondition still initializes firstp

Negative 1435 pIt seems empowering that one can effectively make assertions about legal return emvaluesem of implementing methods just based on the type of the abstract functionmethod.

Negative 1435 pI have an MVC 4.5 project that has most of the UI logic organized in jQuery plugins. I want to protect my code by minification and bundling While I understand that minification will only do so much as far as protection, its better than leaving formatted and documented source files on the server.p  pIdeally, I want my dev server to work as is  files are nonminified and separated. But, when I deploy to the production server, I want the source files to be removed and only minified bundles to be available. Also note, on many occasions my jQuery plugins load other plugins from JavaScript code I use head.js, so I cannot use Script.Render for that. p  pWhat technologies do I use  builtin MVC bundling, SquishIt, Bundler or do I need to resort to MSBuild and Microsoft Axaj Minifier To recap, I want to remove source JS files and just be left with minified bundles in production, and, preferably, find a way to not change head.js references based on whether files are minified or not.p  pThanks for your advice.p

Negative 1435 pI know it sounds heavy weight, but Im trying to solve an hypothetical situation. Imagine you have emNem observers of some object. Each one interested in the object state. When applying the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiObserverpattern relnofollowObserver Patterna the emobservableem object tends to iterate through its observer list invoking the observer codenotifyupdatecode method.p  pNow imagine that a specific observer has a lot of work to do with the state of the emobservableem object. That will slow down the last notification, for example.p  pSo, in order to avoid slowing down notifications to all observers, one thing we can do is to notify the observer in a separate thread. In order for that to work, I suppose that a thread for each observer is needed. That is a painful overhead we are having in order to avoid the notification slow down caused by heavy work. Worst than slowing down if thread approach is used, is dead threads caused by infinite loops. It would be great reading experienced programmers for this one.p  ul liWhat people with years on design issues think li liIs this a problem without a substancial solution li liIs it a really bad idea whyli ul  h2Exampleh2  pThis is a vague example in order to demonstrate and, hopefully, clarify the basic idea that I dont even testedp  precodeclass Observableobject     def initself         self.queues        def addObserverself, observer         if not observer in self.queues             self.queues[observer]  Queue             ot  ObserverThreadobserver, self.queues[observer]             ot.start      def removeObserverself, observer         if observer in self.queues             self.queues[observer].putdie             del self.queues[observer]      def notifyObserversself, state         for queue in self.queues.values             queue.putstate  class ObserverThreadThread     def initself, observer, queue         self.observer  observer         self.queue  queue      def runself         running  True         while running             state  self.queue.get             if state  die                 running  False             else                 self.observer.stateChangedstate codepre

It causes every entry in codeCSgtccode to become equal to code0.0code and it results in my program seg faulting.p  pstrongEdit 2strongbr I think I realized why the method suggested in my first edit did not work. codealphacode is a temporary pointer, created and initialized inside of a function, so once that function is exited, the memory occupied by codealphacode is freed. Since codeCSgtccode points to that memory, it is also freed. Upon this discovery, I think I will rework my code, such that codealphacode and codeCSccode are initially swapped, such that when they are switched again, the end order will be correct.

Negative 1435 pThere are two ways of opening a ToolTipDialog. One is by giving around attribute which is a DOM node and other is by giving x and y coordinates.

Negative 1435 pGood evening, noble experts.  Im likely going to betray some of my ignorance againp  pIve written a python script that creates a window in tkinter, and works the way Id like it to so far as I can tell.  What Id like to do now is turn it into a standalone .exe that will, upon being doubleclicked, generate said window for use.p  pIve installed pyinstaller, and put in the fateful commands to create the .exe from my humble .pyp  precode...python pyinstaller.py w F examplename.py codepre  pand shiny new .exe was made and put into the dist folder.  The problem I seem to be encountering, is that running this application doesnt open up the tkinter window in the script, and Im not sure why.  Based on the tutorials Ive seen online and my own limited understanding of the process, I suspect that it may have something to do with a SPEC file, which I have not yet fiddled with as Im not 100 certain that is whats causing this issue.p  pI would greatly appreciate any insight into this, and if Ive neglected key information that you need, I will try and fill that in asap.  Thank youp  pEdit so it turns out that one of the modules that I was using in this, scipy, has some known issues with pyinstaller.  When I commented out the scipy stuff, it worked the way it was supposed to... minus the scipy of course.  Im going to have to spend some time figuring outunderstanding the workaround for it.p

Negative 1435 pI am a newbie in multithread programming and this is my first post here So please bear with me.  p  pI have two cameras which I would like to track an object simultaneously two independent threads and output its position to the main function or perhaps a third thread. Using the position of the object from each camera, the 3D position of the object should then be calculated. Lets say the first camera outputs emx1em and emy1em, the second camera outputs emx2em and emy2em and these should be used to estimate emxem, emyem, and emzem. p  pI was thinking of defining emx1em, emy1em, emx2em and emy2em as global variables so that they are easily accessible for the third thread. But the problem is that the third thread should be synchronized with the first 2 threads. The third thread doesnt change the content of emx1em, emy1em, emx2em and emy2em. It only uses these values to obtain emxem, emyem and emzem. But if the value emx1em and emy1em is updated and emx2em and emy2em are not yet updated, I want the third thread to pause until the emx2em and emy2em is updated. Or in other words, I want the third thread to use emx1em, emy1em, emx2em and emy2em that are ideally obtained at a time point emtem, or during a very short period of time. p  pI appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this problem. I am thinking of using CreateThread. Is there an easier way  Is it a good idea to use global variable in multithread programming Is it a good idea to output global variables emt1em and emt2em system time from thread 1 and 2 respectively, and compare them in the third thread One problem with this approach might be that since both threads 1 and 2 are doing the same thing, it takes lets say T second for them to complete their task and therefore there is always a fixed lag between these threads which might be longer that what we want.   And as a result, thread 3 would never find emx1em, emy1em, emx2em and emy2em which are obtained very close in timep  pNOTE I am using windows 7, visual studio 2010, programming language C.p

Negative 1435 pI have been writing an application for Android that receives a response from a cgiscript python that access data from a MySQL DB in order to generate dynamic content. I receive the response fine. I am trying to use a python dictionary serverside so that I can respond to the android client with a JSON array. During debugging, if I dont use a dictionary, like thisp  precodewith con      cur  con.cursor     cur.executeSELECT  from posts     rows  cur.fetchall  print Contenttype texthtml print if cur     print row[1] this entry in the DB is a datetime field, however other fields suffer from the same problem else     print Something went wrong. codepre  pIn that case, I get the response on the android client in a desirable format, such as 20130606 230347. p  pOn the other hand, if I create a dictionary and place the value under a key such as my column name like thisp  precodewith con      cur  con.cursor     cur.executeSELECT  from posts     rows  cur.fetchall  print Contenttype texthtml print if cur     for row in rows         d  timerow[1]         print d else     print Something went wrong. codepre  pThen the response I receive has formatting issues. I receive a response likep  precodetimedatetime.datetime2013,6,6.23.3.47 codepre  pThe same happens with numbers that Ive used Decimal on. Instead of showing as just the number, as they do in a normal print, inside the dictionary response they show asp  precodeDecimal12.345678 codepre  pCould anyone with more knowledge than me shed some light on the subjectp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1435 pWeve been having some trouble getting minscore to work.p  pWe have two types. There is usermeta, the parent index type. There is also the child index, userperk specified below.p  pThe query returns both the right documents and accurate scores for those documents, but when I add a minscore  1, it returns no data.p  pAnother weird behavior is that changing the boost value in constantscore does not change the score that is returned. For example, if I have a boost value of 1 and a document that has a score of 29, that document will also have a score of 29 if I set a boost value of 0.1.p  pVery confused here.

Negative 1435 pMy objective is to implement a messenger in a clientserver model. However, in the clients, one client will be a web browser and another would be an android phone. So i need to develop an android app as well for a client. For web server I intend to use Lift with Scala. I wish to use Comet for messages in a fashion similar to described here a hrefhttpsimply.liftweb.netindex2.1.htmlNext relnofollowhttpsimply.liftweb.netindex2.1.htmlNextap  pAlthough this technique might work fine in web browsers, I dont think it will work on the android app. What solution do I have for this How do messengers like whatsapp work  Quickness in sending and receiving responses is an important factor here which is why I chose the Comet model  and also its ease of implementation . However, Im open to new suggestions and ideas for incorporating this functionality. Please guide me through....Im also open to other languages for the server that may be better suited to the task since I havent started development.p

Negative 1435 pWhat Im trying to do is use my own Iphone and Ipad as a simulator through xcode.  Im doing this because the built in simulator cannot get past the log in page on my app, any valid user name and password will result in the error message Service Error, A server with the specified host name could not be found.  Because of this error, I cannot test the code Ive changed.p  pI believe I have the profiles and certificates set up correctly on xcode, when I look at my phones provisioning profiles in the organizer I see Ad Hoc, Dist, Dev, and iOS Team Provisioning profile all with a Valid profile status..p  pBut when I try to run the app on my phone I get the Code Sign error Provisioning profile random letters and numbers cant be found..  Ive searched this issue and came to the conclusion that I needed to modify my .xcodeproj project folder, specifically the project.pbxproj file.  I go to that file and delete the line provisioningprofile[sdkiphoneos]  random numbers and letters..p  pNow when I run the app on my iphone after deleting that line it gives me the error libxmltree.h file not found... Ive found the fix to this problem, but once I fix it ill get the error opensslssl.h not found..p  pIt seems like there is another underlying cause to these problems, because once I fix something it will just break something else.  Thanks for reading and hopefully there is someone out there who had this problem and fixed it.p  pXCode 4.6.3 Please let me know if there are any other specs needed that would help in debugging this problem.p

Please help Ive been up all night fooling with this.p  precodeltWindow     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsdxuihttpschemas.devexpress.comwinfx2008xamlwindowsui     xmlnsdxhttpschemas.devexpress.comwinfx2008xamlcore     xmlnsdxlchttpschemas.devexpress.comwinfx2008xamllayoutcontrol         xmlnsdxbhttpschemas.devexpress.comwinfx2008xamlbars xmlnsdxrhttpschemas.devexpress.comwinfx2008xamlribbon xmlnsdxehttpschemas.devexpress.comwinfx2008xamleditors xmlnsighttpschemas.infragistics.comxaml xClasspNetWPFtile.MainWindow     dxThemeManager.ThemeNameDXStyle WindowStyleNone     WindowStateMaximized     TitlepNetWPFtile Height738.326 Width900 AllowDropTruegt ltdxBackgroundPanelgt     ltDockPanel Margin2,0gt         ltGrid Width888 Margin0,0,0,21gt             ltStackPanel Margin0,12,1,593 OrientationVerticalgt                 ltdxbBarManager CreateStandardLayoutFalse AllowDropTrue ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAuto RenderTransformOrigin0.501,0.512gt                     ltdxbBarManager.Itemsgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem1 ContentNew LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesActionsNew32x32.png RibbonStyleAllgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem2 ContentOpen LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesActionsOpen32x32.png RibbonStyleAllgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem3 ContentSave LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesSaveSave32x32.png RibbonStyleAllgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem4 ContentSave As LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesSaveSaveAll32x32.png RibbonStyleAllgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem5 ContentPrint LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesPrintPrint32x32.png RibbonStyleAllgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem6 ContentPrint Preview LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesPrintPreview32x32.png RibbonStyleAllgt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem7 ContentExport RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesExportExportFile32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem8 ContentRedo RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesHistoryRedo32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem9 ContentUndo RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesHistoryUndo32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem10 ContentCopy RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesEditCopy32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem11 ContentPaste RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesEditPaste32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem12 ContentCut RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesEditCut32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem13 ContentDelete RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesActionsDeleteList32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem14 ContentZoom In RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesZoomZoomIn32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem15 ContentZoom Out RibbonStyleAll LargeGlyphpackapplication,,,DevExpress.Images.v13.1componentImagesZoomZoomOut32x32.pnggt                         ltdxbBarButtonItem xNamebarButtonItem17 ContentPrev.

Negative 1435 pAfter coming across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq161950411292230this questiona, I am concerned that there will not be an answer to the question, but I will hope, anyways.p  pI have setup a few geofences most small and one large. I am using the simulator and I have outputted the radius of the large codeCLRegioncode and it tells me that the radius is 10881.98m around a certain coordinate, but when I simulate the geolocation to 11281.86m away from that same certain coordinate, it does not trigger the codelocationManagerdidExitRegioncode delegate method for the large region.p  pWhile the large region will not trigger codelocationManagerdidExitRegioncode, I have confirmed that the smaller regions will trigger the delegate method every time. Is there a reason why this is not firing Is there a distance buffer around a region Is it documented somewherep  pAny help would be great.p  pEDIT From testing, I need to cut down the radius by around 45.28 in order to have the geofence trigger. Obviously this is not a great solution, as it is very imprecise and it goes against the whole idea of geofencing.p

Negative 1435 pIve created an observer that observers all models for changes to the database.  This auditor observer works great in and of itself, but it destroys the testing suite. Im unclear as to why the observer causes all my tests to fail. If you know, please tell me. Incidentally, Im running Rails 3.2.14.p  pBut more importantly, Im looking for a way to get this observer to play nicely with the testing suite.  I was thinking of adding some sort of flag on the environment configuration layer that the observer class can evaluate at run time.  Then I would just set the flag to false for the dev and test environments and true for production. But I have no idea how I would go about doing this.  Any suggestionsp  pI dont have the option of disabling the observer in my spechelper because a substantial quantity of tests dont actually load the spechelper.  Most of these tests dont actually make changes to the database, but hypothetically, they could and I dont want to have to dig through hundreds of tests files to refactor them.p  pSo, Im looking for a way to disable or incapacitate my observer for the entire test environment.  The configuration layer seems like the appropriate place to do this, but Im not sure how to go about it.  Id love to hear any advice on how to accomplish this.p  pUpdate related post with more detailed account of the issues Im having a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18321693howtodisableanactiverecordobserverinarailsenginenoredirect1comment2688876718321693How to Disable an ActiveRecord Observer in a Rails Engineap

Negative 1435 pIve setup Solr for autosuggestions. It needs to be able to suggest phrases and handle spelling errors. So far, Im using a normally tokenized field for spelling suggestions works fine and a copy of the same field without tokenization to search on with wildcards for autosuggestion e.g. searchterm. This also works ok, but due to wildcards, the scoring is always 1 for each document. In addition, normal scoring wouldnt actually make sense here. The natural way to score would be based on how many results would the suggested phrase generate if it were a search term itself. Something similar to what Solrs spellchecker is using. I dont think this is possible out of the box, but I have no real clue. Any ideas on how to achieve this Or at least improve it Its important that the suggestions remain full phrases.p

Negative 1435 pI am developing a component which needs to process the live feed and broadcast the data to the listeners in pretty fast manner  with about 100 nano second level accuracy, even less than that if I can do that Currently I am raising an event from my code which subscriber can subscribe to. However because in C event handlers run on the same thread which raises the event, my thread which raises the event will be blocked until all subscribers finish processing the event. I do not have control on subscribers code, so they can possibly do any time consuming operations in event handler, which may block the thread which is broadcasting.p  pWhat can I do so that I can broadcast the data to other subscribers but can still broadcast the stuff quite fastp

Negative 1435 pFor few months now I have been developing an Android app using codePhoneGap 2.8code and on the javascript side I have used codeBackbonecode and codejQuerycode as my main frameworks. As my application has grown to a reasonable size, I have started to notice a considerable memory consumption. Having read different articles that explain why codePhoneGapcode requires considerable amount of memory even to run, I still believe that I can do some optimization to how i use memory. p  pIn codeBackBonecode we have a Router object that maps URIs to specific functions, which render me something called a codeViewcode object. Not only I implemented my router functions to create a view and render it, but I also store globally reference to currently being displayed view. So before a new view is created, I tell the old view to make some clean up That is done recursively since views can contain more sub views. Under clean up I currently tell view to undelegate his events I trust codeBackbonecode removes the event listeners. Not much more is done currently. Once new view is rendered, global variable will reference the new view. I trust that javascript GC will release the memory, used by the old view. Alas, I dont things this is happening the more I navigate around my app, the more memory is being used up. I am aware that there is some memory leaking going on, but I cant figure out what is it, that takes memory. One thing I suspect is that old objects are not being garbage collected properly for some reason. I suspect that once I render new html DOM over some container, perhaps old codeDOMcode is causing memory leaks, perhaps some event handlers are being unnecessarily stored somewhere.  p  pWhat I would like to know, if there is any tools or commands or tips on how can I debug trace measure where memory is being allocated. Is there a way to access all event listeners and measure them somehow same for DOM. Any article to smart memory efficient techniques would also be appreciated. Currently only thing that I can thing of to do, is to start recursively deleting all attributes of the objects in the end objects as well I am willing to destroy. p  pAny suggestion is very welcome  Thank you in advance. p

Negative 1435 pIm creating a C library on Linux which has several functions, which together operate upon some global data. In order for these functions to be thread safe, they must employ mutexes at the appropriate points in the code.p  pIn Linux, in order to use pthreads in an application, one needs to link in the appropriate library, emlpthreadem. In the case of my library once compiled, Id like to make it work both if the user of it decided to use pthreads in their application, as well as if they dont.p  pIn the case where a developer does not use threads in their application, they will not link against pthreads. Therefore Id like my compiled library to not require it, and furthermore, employing mutexes in a single threaded application uses needless overhead not to mention is silly.p  pIs there some kind of way to write code with GCC extensions if necessary that a certain block of code will only run if certain symbols were linked in Im aware I can use emdlopenem and friends, but that in itself would require some of what Im trying to avoid. I imagine what Im looking for must exist, as several standard functions are in the same boat, and would require mutexes to be thread safe and they are, but work even when not linked with pthreads.p  pOn this point, I notice that a hrefhttpsvnweb.freebsd.orgbaseheadliblibcgenpopen.crevision250827ampviewmarkup relnofollowFreeBSDs popen functiona on line 66 amp 67 employs a non portable check  emisthreadedem, to determine if threads are used or not, and whether to use mutexes. I doubt anything like that is standardized in any way. But more to the point such code cant compile and link if the symbols arent recognized, which in Linux, the mutex symbols wont even be present if pthread is not linked.p  pTo summarize On Linux, how does one create a library, which knows when threads are also used, and if so, employs mutexes where appropriate, and does not require linking against pthreads, unless the application developer specifically wants to use threading somewherep

Changed permissions on the file stored internally with codefile.setReadablecode. The command fails to set codeWORLDREADABLEcode permissions.br 2. Tried to copy it into another file which was created specifically with codeWORLDREADABLE and WORLDWRITEABLEcode permissions. Oddly, I get a codeFileNotFoundcode error despite the previous lines saying that the file codewordrecorded.wavcode was present.br 3. The permissions on wordrecorded.wav suggest that the file is readable but the program indicates otherwise.br 4. Pulled the wav file out and played it on my system. It plays just fine.br 5. Passed a codeFileDescriptorcode to the program. This has not worked either.  p  pMy questionsbr 1. Where am I going wrong How do I make this workp

Negative 1435 pOn my HTML form, users can enter their name.

Negative 1435 pIm loading data from a web server and presenting the result in a listview. The code is working fine, but the list is empty until the data is done loading from AsyncTask and everytime the user leaves the screen and comes back the list has to load again. I have multiple lists across my application where i do the same approach and it seems clumsy and wrong when all my lists has to load the entire data each and everytime.p  pSo as it is right now im thinking about storing the data somewhere so i can show the old data  until I have gotten newer data from the server and then update the list with the new data. p  pSo my first question would be, where should i store such data In a file or should i create an SQLite database and store the list objects there p  pSince I have multiple lists across my application i was thinking the database approach would be the best solution. Then i could get the latest inserted id for a given objecttable and check the server whether there is new data to retrieve.p  pI have also read about the AsynTaskLoader class which seems to do what im looking for, but i cant really find any good guides to follow. And since i already have my AsyncTask fully working it might be too much unnecessary work to implement the loader.p  pSo yea what would be the recommended approach to this problem  p  pThe data i get back from the server is a JSONArray and im using SimpleAdapter to create my lists.p  pLet me know if you need to see any of the code.p  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 1435 pOk, so I have a basic list of checkboxes as followsp  precode      ltdiv classcontrolgroupgt         ltdiv classcontrolsgt           ltlabel classcheckboxgt             ltinput typecheckbox namelowercase idlowercase checkedtruegt lowercase letters           ltlabelgt           ltlabel classcheckboxgt             ltinput typecheckbox nameuppercase iduppercasegt UPPERCASE LETTERS           ltlabelgt           ltlabel classcheckboxgt             ltinput typecheckbox namedigits iddigitsgt Digits 0 to 9           ltlabelgt           ltlabel classcheckboxgt             ltinput typecheckbox namesymbols idsymbolsgt Punctuation  Symbols ltsmallgte.g.   amp   ...  ltsmallgt           ltlabelgt           ltlabel classcheckboxgt             ltinput typecheckbox nameascii idasciigt All ASCII Characters           ltlabelgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt codepre  pWhen each of the checkboxes is checked the form it sits within submits via ajax to calc.php. Part of the calc uses a value I assign if the checkbox is checked or not, as followsp  precodeif issetPOST[lowercase]          numChars  26           if issetPOST[uppercase]          numChars  26          if issetPOST[digits]          numChars  10          if issetPOST[symbols]          numChars  12          if issetPOST[ascii]          numChars  96      codepre  pSo, as youll see if a user selects more than one checkbox it adds up the respective values in the var numChars. If the user selects All ASCII then the var should have a fixed value of 96 as this is the number of usable ascii chars im interested in. I use this code, found elsewhere on this forum, to remove checks from the other boxes if the ascii box is ticked. p  precodefunction        var el  inputcheckbox      el.onchange, function e           if this.attrid  ascii               if this.ischecked                  ascii.propchecked, false              else                   var l  checkbox                      .filterchecked                      .notascii.length                  if l  0                      ascii.propchecked, true                         else               if this.ischecked                  el.notthis.propchecked, false                   codepre  pIt all works fine. Except for one part. If I select lowercase then numChars is 26. If I then select uppercase then numChars rightly is 52. etc. If I select ascii numChars goes to 96. But then if I select anything else, like uppercase numChars remains at 96 despite the checkboxes updating on the screen. It only happens once Ive selected ascii so no matter what I press after it, it takes another click to update the value of numChars.p  pHope this makes sense. I tried to make a jsfiddle but struggled with the ajax side of things despite reading the echohtml examples..  p
Negative 1435 pI am trying to make a ZMQREP socket reconnect to a new address when connecting to a first socket did not work out. The main question concerns a problem that occurs when the user provides an incorrect socket endpoint. Eg. the server is located at endpoint codetcp127.0.0.112345code but the user tries to connect to codetcp127.0.0.112346code note the 6 instead of 5 in the port number. Now I send a message to the server and the server should reply with another message. If this operations results in a timeout ETIMEOUT, I want the program to reconnect to a new address specified by the user.p  pBelow is a lot of code but please focus on the thread and the main function. The other functions are included so the entire program is compilable. The thread function acts as a server for the main function which acts as a client. If you compile the program you can just run it and the main function will connect to the proper function. However, if you specify an endpoint as argument of the program it will fail unless you specify the correct endpoint of course.p  pSo I hope someone knows how I can make a socket reconnect to a new socketendpoint I always keep either getting ETIMEOUT even when the user specifies the correct endpoint when heshe is prompted.p  pI compile the code like this codeg program.cpp stdc0x  pkgconfig cflags libs libzmq  Wall pedantic gcode Where libzmq is version 2.2.0 .  p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltthreadgt include ltzmq.hgt include ltcstdlibgt include ltcstringgt include ltcassertgt  using namespace std  forward declarations. char recvstr void socket, int options0  int sendstring  void sock, const char message, int opt  0  void  threadfunc  void context, stdstring address, string identifier       int rc     void socket  zmqsocket context, ZMQREP     if  socket          perror LINE            stdcout ltlt identifier ltlt  binding to  ltlt address ltlt endl     rc  zmqbind  socket, address.cstr      if rc  0         char error  strerrorerrno         cout ltlt error ltlt endl           int running  1     while  running           char message         message  recvstr socket          cerr ltlt recieved  ltlt message ltlt endl          if  strcmp message, stop   0              rc  sendstring socket, stopping              if rc                 perror Unable to send string              assert  rc  0             running  0                  else if strcmp  message , reply   0              int rc  sendstring socket, stringreply    identifier.cstr              if rc                 perror Unable to send string              assert  rc  0                  else              sendstring  socket, error           zmqclosesocket     cout ltlt  Server is stopping.ltlt endl   int main  int argc, char argv      int rc     returnvalue a to check whether function succeed     char msg  recieved messages.

Negative 1435 pI am now working on an existing asp.net MVC application which has a few submit button in one web pagee.g. ignore, delete, update, submit... And they all send a post request to the server and the server will perform different operation based on the request action type e.g. ignore, delete, update, submit. p  pHowever, an issue is raised that the model validation will always triggered regardless of the operation. According to the business rule, we only need to perform validation for some certain operations. I can clear the error in the modelstate after the validation. for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7424003mvc3removemodelstateerrorsMVC3 Remove ModelState Errorsa. p  pHowever I am hoping there is a better way to just bypass the model validation according to the operation parameter from the client.p  pBTW I am not allowed to significantly change the way how it works e.g. send to another action for those operation that does not care about the validation, so I am hoping there is some trick that I can use to achieve this easily.p

Negative 1435 pI am trying to develop a SPA application, which uses KnockoutJS and .NET MVC WebAPI for data access. As the application has more than one view, I also want to use some routing.

Projects list with its data is loaded at application startup when page is loaded and it contains basic information about projects. A user can choose a project and see a details view. Details are lazyloaded using AJAX call, when user opens a project.p  pI wanted to give strongPager.jsstrong a try as it was made for Knockout, but I cant figure out how to load extra details, create a viewmodel and present the view to the user, when he chooses a project.

The server will then receive a byte array with all the data in it.p  pAnd this works fine for all primitive types, but it doesnt work too well for my custom structs. Consider the following struct Im usingp  precode[StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential] public struct HotspotUpdate      public string LeaderHash  get set      public string OurName  get set      public CommandSide Side  get set      public CommandType Type  get set      public Vector3 Location  get set   codepre  pI usually make these structs work by specifying the codeSizecode in the codeStructLayoutcode attribute. However, now I have two strings in there of varying size, and I cant for the life of me figure out how I can get the codeMarshalcode to grab a packet which is a byte array and have it marshal it back to the above struct since I cant specify it as an codeLPStrcode and set its size  it will vary.p  pSo whenever I do attempt this, the marshal will yell at me, sayingp  pcodeType HotspotUpdate cannot be marshaled as an unmanaged structure no meaningful size or offset can be computed.codep  pIs there any way I can make this work, or will I have to resort to just sending over strings a byte arrays and working them out on the server endp

Negative 1435 pI embedded Python in C using Boost Python.p  pI wanted to run 2 Python scripts concurrently. The scripts should also have the opportunity to access C member functions.p  pWell, when I use just 1 thread in the main interpreter it can use the member functions. But to run 2 scripts concurrently I create a new interpreter for each thread a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2capiinit.htmlsubinterpretersupport relnofollowhttpdocs.python.org2capiinit.htmlsubinterpretersupporta.

This is an almost totally separate environment for the execution of Python code. In particular, the new interpreter has separate, independent versions of all imported modules, including the fundamental modules builtins, strongmainstrong and sys. The table of loaded modules sys.modules and the module search path sys.path are also separate. The new environment has no sys.argv variable. It has new standard IO stream file objects sys.stdin, sys.stdout and sys.stderr however these refer to the same underlying file descriptors.emp  pSo, is there no possibility to do thatp
Negative 1435 pI am writing a java program that runs a loop and keeps asking the user for input. The program then does a bunch of things with the string, and asks for another string and repeats.p  pThe issue is that many strings are very similar, so i would like to populate the prompt with the input from the last time in the loop. For instance If the user enters a value as followsp  precodeEnter the SKU Number APE6603A codepre  p...

Negative 1435 pHow would you go about converting a decimal value to hex and then do math in C programming Every example of converting decimal to hex that I have seen creates an array and I wouldnt be able to do math if I did that. Something like this.  I just want the basic idea of how to do hex math C. I have mixed files that Im reading from. Part of the files are in hex and part are in decimal. So first step is to convert the decimal to hex. You obviously cant do math hex and decimal without converting one of them. I wanna convert the decimal to hex. The only 2 ways to convert that I have found is to make an array which you cant do math with a char array and the x option with printf and then you cant do math that wayp  precode15 decimal to hex F 17 decimal to hex 11 F hex  11 hex  20 codepre

This is a simple example code of the situation for clarificationp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode[MetadataTypetypeofMetadata] class ModelA       public class Metadata               [Required]          public object Property1  get set            [Required]          public object Property2  get set             public int Property1  get set      public int Property2  get set    [MetadataTypetypeofModelA.Metadata] class ViewModelA      public int Property1  get set   codepre  pThe problem is when the razor engine tries to process the view, it throws the an strongInvalidOperationExceptionstrong with the following error messagep  pThe associated metadata type for type strongViewModelAstrong contains the following unknown properties or fields strongProperty2strong. Please make sure that the names of these members match the names of the properties on the main type.p  pIn my understanding the problem here is that the metadata contains properties which the the view model does not. However, this way I dont really understand the advantages of having a metadata class. So my questions are p  p1 Is there a way to prevent of throwing this exceptionp  p2 If not, what it the best pattern to this situation like using a model, a viewmodel, which contains the subset of the properties of the model, defining data annotations by keeping the DRY approach. p

Negative 1435 pI understand this is more of an arithmetic question than purely a programming question but it relates to a problem Im trying to solve at the moment. Also, I dont know any good places to ask math or JES related topics. p  pThe problem I am having is that, for a uni assignment, we are meant to use JES to draw different national flags. The flags can be any size, which is determined by the user. The flags are rated by difficulty by the patterns and numbers of stars on the flag. p  pAnyway, Im trying to draw the Chilean flag and the only problem Ive run into is how to calculate what the scale of the star should be. p  pHere is the function I have for scaling the starp  precodedef scaleStarpicture, scale    the starting X position is set to 0 sourceX  0  Calculates the scaled width and height of the picture as an integer scaleWidth  intgetWidthpicture  scale     scaleHeight  intgetHeightpicture  scale  Creates an empty picture with the scaled dimensions just calculated scaledPicture  makeEmptyPicturescaleWidth, scaleHeight    Begins the loop that goes through the entire picture and copies the  pixel from the source to the target pixel for scaleX in range0, scaleWidth   sourceY  0   for scaleY in range0, scaleHeight     sourcePixel  getPixelpicture, intsourceX, intsourceY     scaledPixel  getPixelscaledPicture, scaleX, scaleY     colour  getColorsourcePixel     setColorscaledPixel, colour     sourceY  sourceY  scale   sourceX  sourceX  scale return scaledPicture codepre  pI know that the star is 112 the size of the entire flag. So for the scale parameter I tried having the value 12. This worked for a flag picture with 300 width by 200 height. But not for other sizes. I tried heightwidth12 of the entire flag but this only returned a value error. Ive been playing with this code for the past 3 days and every time I think I have the answer, the size of the star is way off. p  pIm really sorry if this a dumb question but if anyone has any advice on how I would go about solving this problem, Id be extremely grateful. If you need more info to help, dont hesitate to ask p

After I closed the command prompt and reopened, python will no longer run from command prompt, and says it is not recognized as an internal or external command. I checked my path variable, and it is still there. The only way I can get it to run is to be in the root codeanacondacode folder.

Negative 1435 pI am at somewhat of a conceptual and practical impasse in writing a correlatedrandom walk code according to a wrapped Cauchy distribution for a specific organism. In the landscape, the organisms movement will be determined based on its location in habitat, outside of habitat, and in edge boundary. The correlatedrandom walk code is as follows, where rho and stepsize will be determined based on whether the organism is either in habitat or outside of habitat.p  precodeset heading heading  pi  180  2  atan   1  rho  1  rho     tanpi   randomfloat 1  0.5  1  180  pi set stepsize randomgamma alpha lambda set xc xc  stepsize  dx set yc yc  stepsize  dy codepre  pThe tricky part, and where I am stuck, is in the edge boundary. Here, the organisms movement is influenced by the direction of the organism to the closest habitat patch. This direction is multiplied by a parameter to result in a modified correlatedrandom walk code. In order to write this bit of the code, it is necessary to know each turtles heading to the closest patch identified as habitat in the landscape. Once that is known, I believe I can modify the correlatedrandom walk code as followsp  precodeset heading [EdgeParameter  TurtleDirectionToClosestHabitat  [1    EdgeParameter[heading  pi  180  2  atan  1  rho  1    rho   tanpi   randomfloat 1  0.5  1  180  pi]]] codepre  pAfter browsing through the NetLogo dictionary, and poking around several sample models, and poking around the Internet, I have yet to find an elegant way to calculate TurtleDirectionToClosestHabitat. The toward primitive seems to be the ticket, though I cannot reason a way to specify the primitive to return the heading for only the turtles in the edge boundary of the landscape toward the habitat patch closest to them. This is where my conceptual and practical impasse lies.p  pAdvice, suggestions, criticisms, and potential bits of code to play with are all welcome. Thank you all.p

Negative 1435 pI copied a TableColumnAdjuster class which seems to be pretty popular.  a hrefhttptips4java.wordpress.com20081110tablecolumnadjuster relnofollowhttptips4java.wordpress.com20081110tablecolumnadjusterap  pHowever, the JTables I am developing are dynamic and can have a large amount of data flow in and out of them as much as 30,000 records. Obviously, when the TableColumnAdjuster has to iterate through every cell it can take awhile and make the Swing interface unresponsive. I tried putting the adjustColumns method on its own thread, but the columns began to resize wildly and randomly. Obviously not threadsafe. So I started to reverse engineer the class, turning variables into volatiles, replacing the hashmap with a concurrent hash map, and separating the calculation from the Swing invokeLater thread.p  pHowever, nothing is working and the columns still resize wildly. Im beginning to wonder if the JTable is not threadsafe altogether. Is JTable even threadsafe for tasks like this Is there a somewhat simple, strategic insertion of code to make the adjustColumns run on a separate thread safely And interact with the Swing thread when it has updates for the viewp

Negative 1435 pAlright, this is one of my first times asking a question on here..  Hopefully there are no other answers questions like this one, Ive looked..  Heres my problem, Im just starting off learning JavaScript and I decided it would be good to make a simple game like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpaceInvaders relnofollowSpace Invadersa.  p  pBut I cannot seem to figure out how to get collisions...  Ive been trying to make it so when the missile hits an image, the image disappears as well as the missile, but its been quite a hard task.  What Ive got happening at this moment is the shipcannon follows mouse codexcode.  And when you fire a missile by clicking it fires a missile straight up with you mouse x position.  All I need it to do now is, have the missile kill the invader.  Any chance someone could tell me the way about how to achieve this, or could someone please make it do what I want completely so I can review over the code and learn.   p  pa

Yet, with every key stroke I see a 40mb increase in my applications memory usage that never seems to go down.p

Negative 1435 pI have built several related applications using Python and Flask. One is an authentication app where the user logs in and receives a token. The others are business apps, which authenticate and authorize the user based on the token. Of course its necessary to sign the token to prevent tampering. Since Im using Python, the itsdangerous module is a natural choice. But it doesnt provide some features that seem important. Writing ones own security code is rarely a good idea, but I feel forced to add my own code on top of itsdangerous to address some limitations. Id like to knowp  pa. Are the concerns below valid b. If so, can anyone recommend a good opensource security solution for PythonFlask that addresses themp  pThe two limitations that most concern me arep  ol lipLack of encryption. Itsdangerous can sign the token but cant encrypt it. The token might contain information the user shouldnt see, such as a list of which roles he or she has been granted.pli lipLeaking information about whether an expired token was ever valid. A malicious user who got hold of a token could use itsdangerous to differentiate between tokens that were never valid, and tokens that used to be valid but have expired. It would be better if such a user could tell only that the token is invalid, with no indication as to why.pli ol

Use a codeperlcode or codebash  sedcode script to build codefoo2.gocode and codefoo3.gocode from codefoocommon.gocode by fixing the codecgo pkgconfigcode lines and adding go build directives for a gtk2 tag. p

Also written in the main is index and i was wondering if i should rename this i as i have used it as i in the search.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated, I was thinking about giving up this whole programming malarkey because its so hard but i guess it just takes time but it is like learning another languagep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  class Person  public string name, family int age  PersonPersonstring family, int age Person  void printOut      cout ltlt The name is  ltlt name ltlt  and their age is  ltlt age ltlt endl      int lsearchPerson family[], int pInfam, int key  for int i  0 i lt pInfam i     if family[i].age  key         return i  return 1   void bubblesortPerson family[], int pInfam   for int i  0 i lt pInfam i      int numbersLeft  pInfam  i      for int j  0 j lt numbersLeft j              if family[j].age gt family[j  1].age                      Person temp             temp  family[j]             family[j]  family[j  1]             family[j  1]  temp                            const int pInfam  4  int main  Person family[pInfam] family[0].name  Richardfamily[0].age  31 family[1].name  Emeliefamily[1].age  32 family[2].name  Umafamily[2].age  4 family[3].name  Holliefamily[3].age  2    int index int searchage index  family, pInfam, searchage  bubblesortfamily, pInfam  return 0  codepre

Negative 1435 pI was wondering if it is possible to upload a file directly to be used with the Box View API without saving it on my local server. The idea is users will be able to upload a file pdf, ppt. etc and it will be used only with the Box Viewer and not saved in my server. Users will be uploading many large files and I am looking to avoid storing them.p  pI know Box requires a URL of the file location for it to generate the content, but is there a way for the file to be uploaded and handled with the View API p  pIf anyone knows of a solution it will be greatly appreciated Thanks.p

Negative 1435 pI maintain a website using Visual Studio 2010, asp.net, and vb.net for the codebehind. Yesterday my software was switched over to Visual Studio 2013 and I converted my 2010 project to the 2013 platform. Initially, the switch didnt seem to cause any unexpected errors. This morning, however, I have been unable to debug the program using breakpoints. I receive this errorp  precodeThe breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document. codepre  pI have checked other stackoverflow questions and have tried multiple solutions, such asp  ol liCleaning and rebuilding applicationli liRebooting Visual Studio and running as administratorli liDeleting Telerik references and then adding them againli liChecking to make sure debug  true is set in Web Configli liTurning Ajax to false to check if any different errors were received or fixedli liChecking that asp.net option in debugging is trueli liChecking the options window for anything out of placeli ol  pAfter all of this, the error still persists. I think it may have to due with some file not using .NET framework 4.5 and using 4.0 instead, but I am not sure how I would check this. Is there a forall method where it will set emallem files to 4.5 framework instead of raking through each file and checkingchangingp  h2EDITh2  pMatt Wilkos comment made me realize I forgot to add in another item that I tried. The answer on another stackoverflow question suggested deleting old .pdb files. Then you look at the symbol load information and compare that to the locations of the actual .pdb file.p  pI had tried this previously and I had 6 .pdb files located across 4 backup files, inside a debug folder within a backup folder, and then inside the bin folder. The symbol load information was searching inside the IIS, temp asp.net files folder, my local symbol cache, and then various Telerik folders. It is searching for Telerik.Web.UI.pdb and there is an error that statesp  precodeCannot find or open the PDB file codepre  pHowever, the answer did not clearly specify how to rectify the situation. How do I point the symbol load information to the accurate folder where the .pdb files are being kept Which file do I delete and keep p  h2EDIT 2h2  pAs a workaround for not being able to debug in Visual Studio 2013, I have copied my code and went back to 2010 to test.

Negative 1435 pI have a list of nodes which belong in a graph. The graph is directed and does not contain cycles. Also, some of the nodes are marked as end nodes. Every node has a set of input nodes I can use.p  pThe question is the following How can I sort ascending the nodes in the list by the biggest distance to any reachable end node Here is an example off how the graph could look like. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYHM9v.png altenter image description herep  pI have already added the calculated distance after which I can sort the nodes grey. The end nodes have the distance 0 while C, D and G have the distance 1. However, F has the distance of 3 because the approach over D would be shorter 2. p  pI have made a concept of which I think, the problem would be solved. Here is some pseudocodep  precodesortedTableltNode, depthgt  used to store nodes and their currently calculated distance tempTableltNodegt used to store nodes  currentDepth  0   fill tempTable with end nodes  while tempTable is not empty        create empty newTempTableltNode nodegt       add tempTable to sortedTable     for every node in tempTable              ifnode is in sortedTable                       overwrite depth in sortedTable with currentDepth                  else                        add node, currentDepth to sortedTable                    get the node in the next layer         for  every newNode connected to node                       add newNode to newTempTable                    tempTable  newTempTable            currentDepth  codepre  pThis approach should work. However, the problem with this algorithm is that it basicly creates a tree from the graph based from every end node and then corrects old distancecalculations for every depth. For example G would have the depth 1 calculatet directly over B, then the depth 3 calculated over A, D and F and then depth 4 calculated over A, C, E and F.p  pDo you have a better solution to this problemp

Negative 1435 pWhen I try to import the ParseFacebookUtils framework in Swift, it does not work. In the documentation a hrefhttpsparse.comdocsiosguideusersfacebooksdkandparse relnofollowhttpsparse.comdocsiosguideusersfacebooksdkandparsea I follow the steps to integrate the FBSDK once I have Parse up and running, errorfree. p  pThe thing is that since the Parse.com iOS SDK was just recently updated you dont really have to create bridging headers anymore for the Parse SDK Frameworks, and in the link above they tell you to include p  precodeimport ltFBSDKCoreKitFBSDKCoreKit.hgt import ltParseFacebookUtilsV4PFFacebookUtils.hgt codepre  pin your header file.

Negative 1435 pI am currently engaged on a IT junior enterprise JE at my college. I have been thinking of having our JE do more strongsocial worksstrong involving programming on our strongcommunitystrong, since one of our goals is to increase the relationship stronguniversitycommunitystrong.p  pWe have thought on giving programming classes to lowerclass kids. However, we found out that this would be impracticable, because of the strongcomplexitystrong of training teachers on what to teach them, how to treat them and what to expect from them. Alongside with some other issues.p  pWhat could be some good ideas for social projects that are relatively easy to put into practice that you might suggest p  pOpensource projects are also a good idea, but we have realised it wouldnt be a very direct way of helping our community. Also, we are a IT junior enterprise, hence it would be very good but not necessary if it would also involve programmingp  pLooking forward to your ideasp
Negative 1435 pIm using SignPost with Java to do a 3legged OAuth integration. Most of the examples I see use Servlet sessions to preserve the OAuthConsumer across multiple requests, but thats not feasible for us because we use Hazelcast to manage a multiclustered environment.p  pNo problem, Ill just use Hazelcast to stash the OAuthConsumer across requests. But when I try to do this I get an Exceptionp  pCaused by java.io.NotSerializableException oauth.signpost.http.RequestParametersp  pLike I said, this is a 3rd Party library so I cant modify it but I do see that OAuthConsumer extends Serializable... so Im not sure what the problem is.p  pHas anyone else encountered this problem and been able to work around itp

Negative 1435 pIs there any way that you can update a table based on another tables columnp  pFor example if I use the codeAdventureWorks2008R2.Production.Productcode table there are 500 products and each has an ID codeProductIDcode and Product number codeProductNumbercode.p  pSo if I have another table called codeAdventureWorks2008R2.Production.ProductRevcode and in that table the codeProductNumbercode column has only 31 of those product numbers. Can I update the codeAdventureWorks2008R2.Production.Productcode to delete those product numbers where they matchp  pSo AK5381 from the codeProductRevcode table would be used to delete the AK5381 codeProductNumbercode in the codeAdventureWorks2008R2.Production.Productcode tablep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1wz0I.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1wz0I.png altenter image description hereap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGibPo.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGibPo.png altenter image description hereap  pResult would bep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comznFmJ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comznFmJ.png altenter image description hereap

Negative 1435 pI have created and submitted a Paypal application  using the classic API. The application is in a conditionally approved state. Paypal reached out and asked additional questions which I responded back with details. The application does not use the Paypal API to make payments. It only reads transactions related data and shows useful reports and insights for users. The API permissions requested arep  precode1.Obtain transaction specific information. 2.Obtain your paypal account balance 3.Search your transaction specific information. 4.Search your transactions for items that match specific criteria and display the results codepre  pI was able to get a live app id and also have the API username, password and API signature. However since our app uses Paypal oauth, the permissions part doesnt work . My guess is this is because the app is conditionally approved. Is this the right assumption Also what is the typical timeline for an app to get approved My Paypal account from which I created and submitted the app is a verified account. I have sent messages from within my developer portal to support but I havent heard anything back.p  pSo far we have been working with a sandbox account. The live application I created is in a different account than the sandbox account. I am not sure if this is an issue.Would be great if someone who has been through the process can confirm.p

Because it search for it using path relative to index.html, not relative to its originall location. I understand this is logical because we have created shadow dom from the script that runs in context of index.html.p  pMy question is how should I develop mycontrol custom component that is part of core library that can be reuseddistributed in different places and still correctly reference resources like cssimagesetc that are also part of the core library.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 1435 pbr Im working on a popup where the user can choose an image, crop it and then upload the croped area. The problem is that if the user choose a big image the popup goes very big so I tried to give the img a fixed size or put it in a fixed div but that ruined the coordinates that I get from the crop function I use Jcrop btw. So the question is haw can I get correct crop coortinates from a resized image. Thank you.p

Negative 1435 pGiven the code sample below, it seems that the variable codecurrOncode is raised up outside of the loop and only instantiated once.  For example, say there are three items in codeitemListcode and on the second iteration codeSomeFunctionThatDoesSomeStuffcode returns codetruecode.  The value of codecurrOncode will then be codetruecode.  On the third iteration, I would have thought that given VB.NET is a block scope language that codecurrOncode would be reinstantiated and default to codefalsecode however, I see that it remains codetruecode and therefore no matter the value of codesOncode, does not get updated in further iterations.  It seems like javascripts function scope where the declaration of codecurrOncode would be pulled up outside the loop.  Anyone know whats going on herep  precode        For Each item As MyItem In itemList             Dim currOn As Boolean             Dim sOn As Boolean  SomeFunctionThatDoesStuffitem             currOn  currOn OrElse sOn              Debug.PrintString.Formatthe value of currOn is 0, currOn         Next codepre  pAs a further example, explicitly setting codecurrOn  falsecode every iteration seems to work as I would have expected the above to work.p  precode            For Each item As MyItem In itemList                  Dim currOn As Boolean  False                 Dim sOn As Boolean  SomeFunctionThatDoesStuff                 currOn  currOn OrElse sOn                  Debug.PrintString.Formatthe value of currOn is 0, currOn             Next codepre

Negative 1435 pIn Polymer 1.0, I would like to have a one way data binding from the child element to the host. You can do this if you define codenotify truecode and codereadOnly truecode when defining the property.Explained a hrefhttpswww.polymerproject.org1.0docsdevguidedatabinding.html relnofollowherea.p  pAlso see my sample below.p  pChildp  precode... Polymer   is childelement,     properties        myProp          type Number,          notify true,          readOnly true,          value 0                codepre  pHostp  precode... ltchildelement myprophostValuegtltchildelementgt ... codepre  pSince there are code ... code and the property is set to codenotify truecode the host will try twoway binding but the child has codereadOnly truecode. So the binding will work only childtohost.p  pIn my setup I want to change the value in the child. So the bound value in the host will change accordingly. But since the property is marked codereadOnly truecode also the child cannot change the value.p  pIs there a way to bind one way from childtohost, prevent the host to overwrite the value but allow the child to do sop  pUPDATE I prepared a Plunk a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditdFKdxHdCA9xgl1oDiQG6 relnofollowherea. Go to childelement.html. You see the value of the codemyPropcode is codeInitial valuecode. When you click the button nothing happens, because it is set to codereadOnlycode. But if you comment out that codereadOnlycode on emline 19em and then click the button, you will see the value changes. So readOnly also prevents to over write the value from with in the child element.p
