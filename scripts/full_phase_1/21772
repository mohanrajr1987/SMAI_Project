Positive 21772 pSo Im working on my first real attempt at an Android app, just a simple scorekeeper for softball games. Ive got it tallying scores, outs, etc, and right now it just displays Home and Away. Id like to give users the chance to enter in actual team names. To this effect, I added a custom AlertDialog that pops up with an EditText, so when you hit OK itll update the HomeAway team name.p  pThe problem is Ive been Googling this for most of the week and Ive not found a single way to actually do this. Ive tried tagging the fragments layout XML so I can find the EditText, but it always gives me a null reference and crashes the app. I added a TextWatcher that presumably watched the fragments text, but once changed and hit OK, nothing happened. Tried adding the TextWatch to the fragment, that crashed I think, it was about two hours ago and Im exhausted.p  pReally, I think I need a way to have the fragment find the TextView with the team name and change it to the value of the EditText when I positive click, but I dont know how to do that. Or maybe Ive seen it and dont understand it, Ive only been doing this about two months. Id post my code, but I deleted out all the stuff that didnt work because it was taking up most of the screen real estate. Any ideasp  pEDIT So I followed advice below on defining views, that found the value of the EditText presumably, but hitting OK just made it set the TextView to a blank value. I think this is because the EditTexts contents went away as the dialog was closed. Either that or this is all wrong.  codeView dialogname  getActivity.getLayoutInflater.inflateR.layout.fragmenthome, null                         EditText mEtName  EditText dialogname.findViewByIdR.id.homeName                         View mainAct  getActivity.getLayoutInflater.inflateR.layout.activitysoftball, null                         TextView oTextView  TextView mainAct.findViewByIdR.id.teamOne                         newName  mEtName.getText.toString                         oTextView.setTextnewNamecodep
Positive 21772 pI am creating a calculator app for a class and I have everything working except the BackSpace Button. The only information that I can find on manipulating the TextView is using the SetText method to reset the TextView to either null or just an empty string.

Positive 21772 pHi I am a new Android Developer i have some doubt in Google map so any one clarify  my doubts.I Have list some address in separate Text view in  database Then when i Touch the one of the text view address that time go to Google map find that address  in androidp
Positive 21772 pSo this is something really strange that i cannot figure out.p  pI am developing a normal educational application on eclipse that is just supposed to have some exercises.p  pEverything was going pretty well, i had one of my exercises completed, then i decided to add a second exercise at a new activity, like the first onep  pSo i added a new activity Exercise3, with nothing in it, only the default textview that eclipse adds and i created an button that leads to that activity from my main menu.p  pThe code is this, and is exactly the same code different names off course that works for my 1st exercise and perfectly changes forms.p  precodebutton2  Button findViewByIdR.id.button2           Capture button clicks         button2.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener              public void onClickView arg0                    Start NewActivity.class                 Intent myIntent  new IntentMainMenu.this,                         Exercise3.class                 startActivitymyIntent                       codepre  pThere is absolutely no error in the log, and the app runs perfectly, but when i press button 2 to open the new activity i created, my application crashes. Again, eclipse shows nothing, the code is exactly the same with my first button to activity which works perfect, but i dont know whats happening with this one.p  pThere is only something strange though, on the new activity i add the standard Hello World textview that always is there is replaced by one saying Error loading. In the mainmenu activity also where i had forgotten that standard textview, now it also says Error loading instead of hello world. Just checked out this was done by my partner in this app from the strings.xml.p  pThe xml is the followingp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin     toolscontextcom.main.pirateisland.Exercise3 gt      ltTextView         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextstringhelloworld gt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pI noticed that the id is missing from the textview, i tried adding it manualy, or completely erasing it and same problem, the application crashes when i try to go to that form from my button.p  pThere is absolutely not error.warning whatsoever from eclipse which makes this quite confusing for me.p  pI guess there is something wrong with the xml, but i just cant find what. Maybe i changed something without noticingp  pAlso tried cleaning the project, restarting eclipse etc, nothing helps and the problem persists.p  pEDIT Adding the manifest.xml p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     packagecom.main.pirateisland     androidversionCode1     androidversionName1.0 gt      ltusessdk         androidminSdkVersion13         androidtargetSdkVersion22 gt      ltapplication         androidallowBackuptrue         androidicondrawableiclauncher         androidlabelstringappname gt         ltactivity             androidname.MainMenu             androidlabelstringappname             androidthemestyleMyTheme gt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnamecom.main.pirateisland.MainMenu gt                  ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.LoginScreen             androidlabelstringtitleactivityloginscreen             androidthemestyleMyTheme gt             ltintentfilter androidlabelstringappname gt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt                  ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.Exercise1             androidlabelstringtitleactivityexercise1             androidthemestyleMyTheme gt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.SplitActivity             androidconfigChangeskeyboardHiddenorientation             androidlabelstringtitleactivitysplit             androidscreenOrientationportrait             androidthemestyleMyTheme gt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt                  ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.MainActivity             androidconfigChangeskeyboardHiddenorientationscreenSize             androidlabelstringtitleactivitymain             androidscreenOrientationlandscape             androidthemestyleMyTheme gt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt                  ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt         ltactivity             androidname.Exercise3             androidlabelstringtitleactivityexercise3 gt         ltactivitygt     ltapplicationgt  ltmanifestgt codepre

Positive 21772 pIve tried enabling the hyperlink in XML to no avail. codeandroidlinksClickabletruecode doesnt seem to work for a lot of people, including me. The only thing that works isp  precodeTextView myTextView  TextView findViewByIdR.id.myTextView myTextView.setMovementMethodLinkMovementMethod.getInstance codepre  pThe problem with this is that if you dont open the browser via the chooser tap outside or back button, the link stays highlighted and it looks bad.

This is pretty glitchy behavior for such a simple task.

Positive 21772 pI am developing a native android game. I have several test devices. My application works very slowly at one of them HTC One m7,Android 5.0.2.

When I remove setText methods from the code, application works fine. Setting static text is also slow. I am sure that problem is setText method itself.pli lipSecond main reason is several animations in layout AnimationDrawable.pli ul  pAfter some research, some people think that setting TextView dimensions to exact values while using setText method solves the problem. I tried that but it did not work.p  pTo solve animation issue I tried to use androidhardwareAcceleratedtrue in AndroidManifest file.

Positive 21772 pSo I am still quiet the novice when it comes to programming but I was curious as to what would be the best practice to making a formula sheet. Of course itll be just straight words, letters and numbers in the layout but some of those math formulas have a lot of characters that wouldnt be able to be read by the textview. So should I just make screenshots of formulas I make on word or is that too much memory to waste. Also to zoom in and out how do I go about that. p

Positive 21772 pI am trying a show a console like screen in the ios app for ongoing current activities. I was able to make the GUI and other process. The data constantly written to a text file and textview parallel. As the textview has a limit to get max characters in its container, I am braking the data into chunks and fetching 10000 characters of old data if scrollbar goes towards top navigaitonbar and latest if goes downwards. The problem is, the scrolling becomes and handling data is difficult. Is there any plugin or working solution which works like xcode log console screen without any issue.p

Negative 21772 pIm currently working on an internal sales application for the company I work for, and Ive got a form that allows the user to change the delivery address.p  pNow I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea Im using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed.p  pHeres a screenshot of it currently.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXK48E.png altISO Addressp  pAny ideasp  hr  pChrisp  pA good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize, I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it.  As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.p  pI can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable.  Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 one takes 5 lines.  Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major nono.p  pI guess I should be a bit more specific, Im after vertical resizing, the width doesnt matter as much.  The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number the large 1 gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small as you can see on the screenshot.p  pIts not about having a gimick, its about having a text field the user can edit that wont take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.p  pThough if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem Im open to that too.p  hr  pOrionp  pThanksp  pIve modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd, I changed it to activate on keyup, because it wouldnt take into consideration the character that was just typed.p  precoderesizeIt  function     var str   isoaddress .value   var cols   isoaddress .cols   var linecount  0   A str.split n  .each function l       linecount  1  Math.floor l.length  cols   take into account long lines        isoaddress .rows  linecount  codepre

Negative 21772 pI have a simple HTML table with 2 columns containing text fields and headers for Name, Comments and Email.p  pIm looking for the best strategy on styling this HTML fragment if it were to appear on multiple pages  requiring different dimensions on each page. Ive been reading a lot about CSS recently but havent stumbled across enough information yet that really makes me comfortable to know the best way to design such .css.p  pFor instance I might show the comments form at 50 width on the comments page, but only at 20 in a sidebar in some additional places on the site. p  pI am mainly concerned about styling the widths of the boxes  but of course the same approach applies for the text. For instance the name field should not be as wide as the email field. Im thinking fixed widths are better than percentages.p  pThere are obviously many ways to style it. Assume I have 1 master css file already.p  p1 Put percentage widths on the codeinputcode tags and then the outer div would be 100 width for whatever panel it is contained in. This requires no page specific css but I dont like the idea of percentages inside the codetdcode tags, plus I cant change the height easily of the codetextareacode.p  p2 create styles for Name, Comments and Email in each individual page as additional styles in codeltheadgtltstylegtcode p  p3 style based on Name, Comments and Email in a page specific css file. Are page specific files good or bad Im not even sure I like styling based on the ids here because theyre dynamically generated and if for some reason they needed to change Id have to update the css everywhere.p  p4 style based on Name, Comments and Email but qualify them with a descendent selector specific to each page. So id have code.faqPage Namecode for when this appears on the FAQ page. Obviously these go in my master css file. p  p5 create class names for emailFieldcode, codenameFieldcode and codecommentsField [options 2,3,4 are repeated for this option]p  p6 create class names for shortFieldcode, codefullWidthFieldcode and codetextInputField [options 2,3,4 are repeated for this option]p  p7 you get the idea p  p8 something else p  pIm just a little overwhelmed with all the options.

Negative 21772 pIve created a WPF control inheriting from FrameworkElement that displays a tiled graphic that can be panned. Each tile is 256x256 pixels at 24bpp. Ive overridden OnRender. There, I load any new tiles as BitmapFrame, then draw all visible tiles using drawingContext.DrawImage.p  pNow, whenever there are more than a handful new tiles per render cycle, the framerate drops from 60fps to zero for about a second. This is not caused by loading the images which takes in the order of milliseconds, nor by DrawImage which takes no time at all, as it merely fills some intermediate render data structure.p  pMy guess is that the render thread itself chokes whenever it gets a large number 20 of new BitmapSource instances that is, ones it had not already cached. Either it spends a lot of time converting them to some internal DirectXcompatible format or it might be a caching issue. It cannot be running out of video RAM Perforator shows peaks at below 60MB, I have 256MB. Also, Perforator says all render targets are hardwareaccelerated, so that cant be it, either.p  pAny insights would be appreciatedp  pThanks in advancep  pDanielp  pRandomEngybr BitmapScalingMode.LowQuality reduced the problem a little, but did not get rid of it. I am already loading tiles at the intended resolution. And it cant be the graphics driver, which is uptodate Nvidia.br Im a little surprised to learn that scaling takes that much time. The way I understood it, a bitmap regardless of its size is just loaded as a Direct3D texture and then hardwarescaled. As a matter of fact, once the bitmap has been rendered for the first time, I can change its rotation and scale without any further freezes.p
Negative 21772 pSometimes due to the SCM not strictly remembering the timestamp of files the generated Makefile will think that it needs to rerun autoreconf i or equivalent to regenerate Makefile.in from Makefile.am, configure from configure.ac, etc..p  pHow do I prevent thisp  pI want to prevent it because it causes these problemsp  ul liwhen creating a dist archive git archive formattar ... the timestamp will be incorrect and the problem will be there for endusers. Not cool.li liOn slow systems this makes the compile take a lot longer, because its no longer configure, make, make install, but configure, autoreconf i, configure, make make install.li ul  pI know I can touch the generated files prior to making a dist tarball, but in my opinion that only solves the problem for the tarballs, not for developers. Its also an ugly hack to work around a misfeature that should just be turnoffable. Also, it breaks git archive, since the timestamps wont always be correct there anyway.p  pOther SCMs also have this, so the problem is not IMO with git.p
Negative 21772 pI am trying to remove the windows logon screen winlogon from an executable launched from a service. The service would start automatically with windows and wait for commands from another computer. When it receives a command, it will launch an exe which will start cmd.exe under a particular username.p  pThe service is already present. I have the job of writing this executable. Currently, I have written the executable CmdLogin which starts cmd.exe under a different user through calls to LogonUserW, ImpersonateUser and CreateProcessWithLogonW. I specify lpDesktop as WinSta0Default. The only catch is that the service must run under an administrator account but that is a different problem.p  pThis works perfectly fine when called from a command prompt even on Windows 7. This also works when called from the service when a user has logged on and viewing his desktop like I do when debugging on the same machine. However, like I said above, my real requirement is for this to work even when the windows logon screen is displayed. Currently, the exe gives a proper exit code but the window does not appear. However, when the user logs in, he sees the cmd window on the desktop.p  pOne solution I found was to use WinSta0WinLogon for lpDesktop instead of Default. I am yet to try this. However, this looks like it will show the cmd window right over the login screen. What I really need is to actually emulate the user login to winlogon and show his actual desktop and the cmd window.p  pI looked around and found GINA and Winlogon Notification Packages. They seem like an overkill and I am not sure if that will even solve the purpose here. Moreover, these are deprecated in Windows Vista which makes me think there is a better and neater method to solve this.p  pAny suggestions on what should I use to achieve this For the record, the executable is in C with API calls using PInvoke. I am open to using a C dll that I can call from this C application too.p  pThank you,br  Husainp

Negative 21772 pI am working on a largish internal web application which has multiple modules security, execution, features, reports, etc..  All the pages in the app share navigation, CSS, JS, controls, etc.  I want to make a single Web Application project, which includes all the pages for the app, then references various projects which will have the database and business logic in them.  However, some of the people on the project want to have separate projects for the pages of each module.p  pTo make this more clear, this is what Im advocating to be the projects.p  precodeWebInterface SecurityLib ExecutionLib etc... codepre  pAnd here is what they are advocatingp  precodeSecurityInterface SecutiryLib ExecutionInterface ExecutionLib etc... codepre  pproject will be published to a virtual directory of IISp  pBasically What Im looking for is the advantages of both approaches.  Here is what I can think of so farp  h1Single Virtual Directoryh1  h2Prosh2  ol liModules can share a single MasterPageli liModules can share UserControls this will be commonli liLinks to other modules are within the same Virtual directory, and thus dont need to be fully qualified.li liLess chance of having incompatible module versions together.li ol  h1Multiple Virtual Directoriesh1  h2Prosh2  ol liCan publish a new version of a single module without disrupting other modulesli liModule is more compartmentalized.  Less likely that changes will break other modules.li ol  pI dont buy those arguments though.br First, using load balanced servers which we will have we should be able to publish new versions of the project with zero downtime assuming there are no breaking database changes. Second, If something breaks another module, then there is either an improper dependency or the break will show up eventually in the other module, when the developers copy over the latest version of the UserControl, MasterPage or dll.  p  pAs a point of reference, there are about 10 developers on the project for about 50 of their time.  The initial development will be about 9 months.p

Negative 21772 pIm doing this for fun or as 4chan says for teh lolz and if I learn something on the way all the better.

I thought about a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiArtificialNeuralNetworks relnofollowArtificial Neural Networksa mainly because I remember enjoying that chapter but as far as I can tell thats mainly used to classify things i.e. given a finite set of choices [x1...xn] which x is this given input not really generate anything. p  pIm not even sure if this is possible or if it is what should I go about learningfiguring out. What algorithm is best suited for thisp  pTo those worried that I will use this as a bot to spam or provide bad answers to SO, I promise that I will not use this to provide bad advice or to spam for profit.

Negative 21772 pHey folks, I have to apologize for my inexperience here, Ive been working on this for about an hour but Im so new to jQuery that I dont even know emwhatem to search for...p  pIve got a page a hrefhttpmilliondollarextreme.tv relnofollowhttpmilliondollarextreme.tva that has multiple YouTube video embeds on it.  I am trying to make the videos resize to fill the divisions that they are placed in, dynamically, according to that divisions width so that I have the option to change it later.  Simply putting in  width 100  will work for the width, but the videos dont maintain their aspect ratio.  So I used the following scriptp  precodecontainer width30  ltscriptgt var vidPlayer  embed var aspect  vidPlayer.attrheight  vidPlayer.attrwidth     window.resizefunction            var playerWidth  container.width           vidPlayer             .widthplayerWidth             .heightplayerWidth  aspect     .triggerresize ltscriptgt codepre  pThis is currently not implemented on my page, but it emdoesem work for single postings.  For the permalink, single entry postings, it works perfectly.  However, on the index of videos, where 510 videos are going to be posted at a time, it will only work if all the videos are the same aspect ratio.  If the first video is 43 widthheight, then all subsequent video players get resized 43, even if the video is supposed to be 169, or something else.p  pIm assuming that the reason for this, is that the script searches for embed, and once it finds one, it stops searching.  It has the variables, and it applies them to all subsequent video players regardless of the dimensions.p  pLets say Ive got ten videos on a page.  Five of them are your standard 43 aspect pictures, with dimensions like 640x480px.  The other five are 169 aspect ratio 1280x720px.  I need to make this script check each one then resize on an individual basis, rightp  pIve got to use a script because I might change the design layout division width in the future, and I have about forty or so more videos to post.p  pI dont even know emhowem or emwhatem functions to use here.  It looks like .each or .live might be good bets, and I tried tossing them in there to no avail.  Any help would be hugely appreciated.p

When this handler is invoked, I set the position of my Cursor to the first visible position so I can look at the data for that rowp  precode        public void onScrollAbsListView view, int firstVisibleItem,                 int visibleItemCount, int totalItemCount              mCursor.moveToPositiongetListView.getFirstVisiblePosition             ... codepre  pI then reference the data in the Cursor to make my display changes.p  pHeres the thing  This working is spotty.  Most of the time it works perfectly.  I cant make it screw up.p  pHowever, sometimes getListView.getFirstVisiblePosition does not return 1 until the 3rd item index 2 is really the first visible item.  It displays 0 when the 0 index is showing.  It displays 0 when the 1 index is showing.  It displays 1 when the 2 index is showing and so on.  Additionally, it only does this when the user is scrolling down the list.  If the user is scrolling backwards up, getFirstVisiblePosition returns the correct value.p  pIm wondering if this isnt related to some efficiency problem.  This handler is going to execute over and over and over as the user scrolls.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on what could be the problem  Does anyone have any better solutionsp  pUpdatep  pDo I remember hearing that getFirstVisiblePosition is really only a guess and that Android essentially supposes what index might be available by rows probable height  If this is so, then I have a problem.  Some rows in my list are bigger than others.  If this is the case, is there any way around itp

Negative 21772 pI have a program that needs to load files from a directory as soon as they are written.  I got the FileSystemWatcher to notify me of changes to the directory.  Rather than check the event for what changed I just list the files and start processing all that I found.p  pTo prevent trying to read a file which is still being written I have code likep  precodetry      fs  fi.OpenFileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite,                     FileShare.None     message  new byte[fs.Length]     int br  fs.Readmessage, 0, intfi.Length  catch Exception e       Ill get it next time around     return  finally      if fs  null         fs.Close  codepre  pThe problem is that for some files, about 1 in 200, the program read all zeros.  File length is correct but the content appear to be all zero bytes.  When I check the file latter I find it does contain actual correct data.  I thought the way I was opening the file would prevent premature access to the file.p  pIm testing this by copying files to the directory with the DOS command copy InFile0 dropdir  About 100 files per execution.  Possibly this command does the copy in two steps  1 allocate space and 2 fill space and my program occasionally jumps in the middle of the two.p  pAny ideas on how to code this to be reliablep  pstrongUpdatestrong  I dont have control over the writing program  it could be anything.

Negative 21772 pI need to edit the header information of several PDF files. What Id like to achieve is to remove all header data before codePDFX.Y.Zcode.p  pWhat I came up with as a possible solution was to open the PDF in binary mode, read each character until codePDFX.Y.Zcode is found. Then continue reading the rest of the stream and save it to a new file. I thought this way I will end up with an exact binary copy of the PDF, just with different header information.p  pWhats the easiestbest way to do this in C Are there any libraries available that could help me do this Im also interested in hearing different approaches to solve this problem.p  pThanks.p

Negative 21772 pAre there any modern, common CPUs where it is unsafe to write to adjacent elements of an array concurrently from different threads  Im especially interested in x86.  You may assume that the compiler doesnt do anything obviously ridiculous to increase memory granularity, even if its technically within the standard.p  pIm interested in the case of writing arbitrarily large structs, not just native types.  p  pNotep  pPlease dont mention the performance issues with regard to false sharing.  Im well aware of these, but theyre of no practical importance for my use cases.  Im also aware of visibility issues with regard to data written from threads other than the reader.  This is addressed in my code.p  pClarification  This issue came up because on some processors for example, old DEC Alphas memory could only be addressed at word level.  Therefore, writing to memory in nonword size increments for example, single bytes actually involved readmodifywrite of the byte to be written strongplus some adjacent bytesstrong under the hood.  To visualize this, think about whats involved in writing to a single bit.  You read the byte or word in, perform a bitwise operation on the whole thing, then write the whole thing back.  Therefore, you cant safely write to adjacent bits concurrently from different threads.p  pIts also theoretically possible, though utterly silly, for a compiler to implement memory writes this way when the hardware doesnt require it.  x86 can address single bytes, so its mostly not an issue, but Im trying to figure out if theres any weird corner case where it is.  More generally, I want to know if writing to adjacent elements of an array from different threads is still a practical issue or mostly just a theoretical one that only applies to obscureancient hardware andor really strange compilers.p  pYet another edit  Heres a good reference that describes the issue Im talking aboutp  pa hrefhttpmy.safaribooksonline.combookprogrammingjava0321246780threadsandlocksch17lev1sec6 relnofollowhttpmy.safaribooksonline.combookprogrammingjava0321246780threadsandlocksch17lev1sec6ap

Negative 21772 pIve built a pretty simple content manager for a website that I have. For every page, the user has control over what content is displayed by using an Admin tool.p  pNow, my client wants the ability to add entire pages.

Negative 21772 pI have a window with two columns of fields. On the left, there is an codeNSTableViewcode and an codeNSTokenFieldcode, and on the right, there are two codeNSTextFieldcodes. I want the tab order to go down the left, then down the right. So the order should be codeNSTableViewcode, codeNSTokenFieldcode, codeNSTextFieldcode, codeNSTextFieldcode in my window.  However, Cocoa appears to be determining its own preferred order, going from the top to the bottom. The codeNSTokenFieldcode is positioned lower in the window than any other control, so it will always tab from codeNSTableViewcode, to the right codeNSTextFieldcodes, then back to the bottom left codeNSTokenFieldcode.p  pI have tried following this section of the Apple developer documentation called a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualObjCTutorial05View05View.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40000863CH7SW11 relnofollowEnable Tabbing Between Text Fieldsa and dragging nextKeyView in Interface Builder between the fields in the order that I want.

Negative 21772 pI know this is a common question as I have read many threads on here and other forums about it but for the life of me I can not get the camera rotation that I desire. I want the camera to be able to look around and not for it to orbit around a point, this point being the OpenGL origin.p  pI am aware that there is no camera in OpenGL, the terrain moves and not the viewpoint, etc. and all of those similar concepts but it has not helped me in solving this. p  pUnfortunately I am stubborn and want to write my code with no deprecated features and so this eliminates 99 of the similar situations I have read about since most of those solutions were with gluLook and similar functions. p  pThe matrix class I am using is similar to the one that is used by the OpenGL SuperBible 5th Edition  a hrefhttpoglsuperbible5.googlecode.comsvntrunkSrcGLTools relnofollowsourcea, GLFrame.h is the main file of interest but have adapted it to use the a hrefhttpglm.gtruc.net relnofollowOpenGL Mathematics Librarya.p  pThe typical response to this question is to translate to the origin, rotate, then translate back, but this does nothing for me.p  pSome codep  precodevoid rotateLocalX GLfloat pAngle       if  mRoll lt mRollLimit  ampamp  mRoll gt  mRollLimit                 store away the current location so I can translate back to it         glmvec3 tempOrigin  getOrigin           mRoll  pAngle           Go to the Origin          you can also subtract the current location to get to 0.f          also doing glmtranslate mMatrix,  tempOrigin   gt rotate gt          glmtranslate mMatrix, tempOrigin  has the same result         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 0 ]  0.f         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 1 ]  0.f         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 2 ]  0.f         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 3 ]  1.f           Rotate the matrix         mMatrix  glmrotate mMatrix, pAngle, glmvec3 1.f, 0.f, 0.f             Go back to the original location         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 0 ]  tempOrigin.x         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 1 ]  tempOrigin.y         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 2 ]  tempOrigin.z         mMatrix[ 3 ][ 3 ]  1.f          normalize        codepre  pAnd if it is of any consequence, I am treating the camera matrix as the view matrix with a separate model matrix [viewmodelmodelview] and a perspective projection matrix.p  pFinally a typical frame goes like this check for input moverotate camera as appropriate, render skybox ignoring the originlocation column of the viewcamera matrix, draw everything else taking into account the entire view matrix.p  pI apologize for asking such a common question but two days of searching and trying various different solutions has yielded no positive results.p  pThank you.p

Negative 21772 pI have a problem when merging from the trunk into a development branch in an SVN tree.p  pThe history of the project is this. It started with just a single trunk. About revision 207, the first branch was created. Then, at revision 331, the branch of interest was split off from the trunk.p  pWere now at revision 384. Most of the changes between 331 have been made on the branch of interest, but a few have independently been made on the trunk.p  pSo that the branch stays in tune with the trunk, I wanted to merge from the trunk into it. So I duly did sop  precodesvn merge trunk . codepre  pHowever, I find that all manner of conflicts are popping up. A few conflicts I might understand, but almost all directories and files in the tree are affected.p  pWhat makes it worse is that most of these purported conflicts are actually changes that were committed to the trunk between 207 and 331, and are therefore already incorporated in the branch, having been there since the branch was split off from the trunk.p  pWhats worse than that is that a number of the supposed conflicts are tree conflicts, involving files that were deleted or renamed, again between 207 and 331. Because they dont exist on the branch any more, and indeed shouldnt exist there, I cant see any way to resolve the problem.p  pA fix is complicated because for almost all files, the branch is correct, and so a merge in, followed by accepting the branch copy, leaves me with nothing to commit, so the server never gets the hint that the merge has in fact been carried out.p  pIve tried several things to fix itp  precodesvn cleanup codepre  pIt seemed to me that this didnt do anything pertinent.p  precodesvn checkout branchesbranchofinterest newlocalcopyofbranchofinterest codepre  pThe problem persisted into the new copy of the checkout.p  precodesvn merge recordonly r207331 trunk . codepre  pInterestingly enough, the supposedly recordonly merge also tried to change the files in my local copyp  precodesvn merge trunk . codepre  pThis generated a whole pile of conflicts and tree conflicts, even after Id fought with the recordonly merge, painstakingly resolving the changes it the recordonly merge applied.p  pI should also say that when I started, my client was running 1.6.17 and the server 1.4.6. However, the server has since been upgraded to 1.6.17 too, and the problem persists.p  pIs there any way people have found to solve this problem Doing a full merge and resolving files one by one would be incredibly timeconsuming, and at this point  for obvious reasons  I dont even have confidence that the next time my SVN wouldnt just try to pull the same thing on me all over again.p

Negative 21772 pIm having an issue with pthreadmutexunlock and my native activity NDK app.  Ive added logging messages to each mutex initialization, lock, lock success and unlock.  My program is getting deadlocked because the mutex unlock is telling me that the thread trying to unlock the mutex did not lock it.  My logging says otherwise.  So Im wondering if there is something Im doing  not doing that could be causing this.  The number in  is the mutext followed by the code line number and thread id returned by pthreadself. To me it looks as though thread 1584064 has acquired the lock and is doing its processing.  Then thread 1597448 attempts to lock and correctly is paused waiting to acquire the lock.  The problem is when 1584064 then completes its work and tries to release the lock pthreadmutexunlock returns an error 1.    p  blockquote   p0921 135527.098 WARNnativeactivity1333 Try to lock mutex   2154220968 Line3041 Thread1584064p      p0921 135527.098 WARNnativeactivity1333 Success Locked Mutex   2154220968 Line3041 Thread1584064p      p0921 135531.668 DEBUGdalvikvm352 GCEXPLICIT freed 8K, 4 free   8606K8963K, paused 3ms423msp      p0921 135531.898 WARNnativeactivity1333 Try to lock mutex   2154220968 Line3041 Thread1597448p      p0921 135532.198 WARNnativeactivity1333 Error1 Unlocking   Mutex2154220968 Line3045 Thread1584064p blockquote  pInitialization is a macro that looks like thisp  precodedefine InitializeCriticalSectionp, X    LOGWInitialize Mutexu, p  p  PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER  pthreadmutexattrt attr  pthreadmutexattrinitampattr  pthreadmutexattrsettypeampattr, PTHREADMUTEXNORMAL  int iip  pthreadmutexinitpthreadmutext p, ampattr  pthreadmutexattrdestroyampattr  LOGWInitialize Mutexu Returned d, pthreadmutext p, iip   codepre  pOne thread is the standard NDK thread, the other one is my own timer thread initialized like thisp  precodepthreadt thread pthreadattrt pattr int state state  pthreadattrinitamppattr  pthreadattrsetdetachstateamppattr, PTHREADCREATEDETACHED  if state      LOGWCreating Timers Thread d MS, dwMsecs     int iRetTest  pthreadcreateampthread, amppattr, TimersThread, void pTimer     pthreadattrdestroyamppattr  codepre  petc... error handlingp  pIt doesnt seem to make any difference if I AttachCurrentThread to the vm or not in my timers thread.

Negative 21772 pI dont know but it may be no sense question to many of you, but I was asked in an interview and I really got confused as I have just started working on SQL Server.

Is it the only way to do this or is there a easy way of doing this I dont have a great knowledge of SQL Server. I am trying to learn it. I am using C 4.0, SQL Server 2008 Express.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pLet me explain the Interveiw Question. To be precise, they asked me that, they had a form to filled in by a user in winforms. That form was divided into multiple Tab Pages56 in a Tab Control. Now they wanted to feed the data in the database by a single click means, they did not want to send the data page by page. Rather they wanted to feed the data by a single click of a button. Either complete data or none.p  pWhat I answered is, I will do it through transaction. For clarity i will frame an Insert command for every page and Execute them in a transaction. If succeed Commit otherwise rollback. p  pBut the immediate reply was, Transaction is fine, but will you write all the textboxes value in insert commandp  pI said if something is null I will ignore, but all the time values can not be null as different users will be filling the form in a different way. So it is better to include all textboxes value or sql parameters in our SQL Command.p  pBut the question was again same, Will you be writing all the textboxes values if at all they count to 100s or 200sp  pWith a confused mind, my answer was yes.p  pAnd they did not look satisfy.p  pThats the reason I asked in 1 comment. Can it be done with a list. I mean, if I have all the controls added into a list, can we use that list in anyway But now I feel, we can not.p  pAnd ya they kicked me out of the selected candidate list  LOL, never  mind.p

Negative 21772 pI think this is a memory issue, but im unsure on what to do here.p  pMy issuep  pIve nearly finished a game using cocos2d for the iphone, with retina gfx, Ive made the app universal, and have done adjustments to make it run correctly on the iPad, mostly I use the retina spritesheets on the ipad, with a few additional images contained inside the hd spritesheets to cover the edges of the screen etc.p  pEverything is working fine, the iPad, when in the game runs at 60fps, like on the iphone4 i usually get about 4050fps on iphone3g, however, occasionally, after 5 minutes or so of moving between menus on the iPad generally, but not always, after unloading the game engine and moving back to the menus, the game falls over.p  pIn the debugger, i get Received memory warning., shortly after not immediately, when a new spritesheet or graphic is loaded not creation of a sprite, but the actually loading of a new texture into memory, the app closes and all that I get in the console is gdb with no stacktrace.p  pIm struggling to find a solution, when moving from my game engine to my menus, I have a loading screen, which is mostly created using 1 full screen image, and some text, all other textures, spriteframes and preloaded soundfx are then purged from memory before anything new is loaded in.p  pIve attempted to run the ipad with leaks and allocations on in instruments, but as soon as the app loads, instruments crashes every time.p  pDoes anyone happen to know what the max memory space is for an ipad app before it closes i thought id atleast get 3 warnings, not 1, and how many 2048 x 2048 sheets does that equate toop  pEDIT New cause of irrational memory disappearance discoveredp  pSo, weeks later, I stumble onto this post on the cocos2d forums.p  pa hrefhttpwww.cocos2diphone.orgforumtopic31092 relnofollowhttpwww.cocos2diphone.orgforumtopic31092ap  pThis bug in iOS5 is likely to be the main cause of my troubles, all advice and suggestions have helped, in my opinion, to tighten up my app as a whole.p

I can either use the GAEs bulkloader by calling appcfg.py uploaddata application kind filename  OR I can go into my webapps datastore admin section, select the entities I want to backup, and then click the Backup Entities button. Unless I am mistaken, the Backup Entities button will create a backup of my datastore in the blobstore while using the appcfg.pys downloaddata will create a local backup. The backups will be happening weeklymonthly and the primary reason will be in case one of the webapps admins accidently deletes important data.

Why is this, and how can I fix itp  pEDIT Below is the verbatim message from PHPLDAPAdmin. Note that its not exactly an error, so much as an absence of proper permissions.

Negative 21772 pI have developed a ASP.NET MVC website that also hosts a WCF 4 service and I have created a .NET Windows application that complements the website and interacts with it by consuming that web service via the internet. Both programs were created using .NET 4 in Visual Studio 2010. The binding used with the WCF service is a WsHttpBinding.p  pMy emonlyem security requirement is that the WCF service is not consumed by some unknown party, as that would contaminate the information in my websites database. I have no need for any privacy I dont care if some third party gets to see the messages I am sending to the web service i.e., no need for encryptionp  pConsidering that single requirement, and as far as my knowledge about security in web services goes, the best way to implement that security scenario would be for the client to sign each SOAP message with a X509 Certificate, and have the web service trust any message signed with a certificate present in its trusted people store. Since certificates use PublicPrivate key pairs, even if the message is not encrypted it cannot be reproduced by an unauthorized third party without the private key used to sign the message. This would also assure me message integrity.p  pConsidering that decision, I have created a test certificate using makecert.exe. I installed the version with embothem the private and public key in the client machine the one with the windows application, in the Current User My certificate store. Then, I exported the certificate without the private key, and installed it in Trusted People of Local Machine certificate store of the web server.p  pMy unsuccessful attempt to configure that scenario so far goes like thisp  pBinding is configured to use Message security, where the Message expects client credentials of the certificate type. Also, the server is configured to use PeerTrust instead of ChainTrust, since the test certificate is not emitted by a trusted CAp  precodeltbindingsgt   ltwsHttpBindinggt     ltbindinggt       ltsecurity modeMessagegt         lttransport clientCredentialTypeNone proxyCredentialTypeNone gt         ltmessage clientCredentialTypeCertificate gt       ltsecuritygt     ltbindinggt   ltwsHttpBindinggt ltbindingsgt  ltbehaviorsgt   ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehavior nameStandardgt       ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledtrue gt       ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultstrue gt       ltserviceCredentialsgt         ltclientCertificategt           ltauthentication certificateValidationMode  PeerTrust trustedStoreLocationLocalMachinegt         ltclientCertificategt       ltserviceCredentialsgt     ltbehaviorgt   ltserviceBehaviorsgt ltbehaviorsgt codepre  pThe configuration on the client windows application sets the certificate as its credential.

As far as I understand, the service certificate would allow the client to authenticate the service, but I dont need that I just want the service to authenticate the client and thats it. I strongdostrong understand this means that if someone impersonates the web server by tampering the DNS settings of my client computer, for example it would receive the messages from my client and the client would not know it is not communicating with its intended recipient I dont mind if that happens.p  pIn summary, my question is How do I configure in WCF the security scenario Ive describedp  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 21772 pI want to know few basic things about strongconnection establishment between client and serverstrong. suppose my web page has left menu where i have some links, on click of those  child pages  are open in the right side of master page .Now each link is requesting a new web page to  the server. Each web page is calling 56 web services asynchronously to get the data. So  if i am clicking on a left menu link, a connection is established between client and  server using codeclient IP and Portcode to codeserver Ip and portcode. But before the response comes,  suppose i clicked on other link of menu then how server knows that old conneciton is  terminated and new connection is established.next thing,when i clicked on a link, request  goes to server, server process the request but before sending the response if connection  is terminated from client side, what happens to that response, does server discards the  response and takes the new request for process. p  pactually i have lot of confusion, so if anyone can explain me the full clientserver round trip process,that will really very helpful . p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 21772 pIm reading the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspythondatastoreoverview relnofollowdocumentationa for Google App Engine and stumbled upon something that I dont quite understandp  blockquote   pThe Datastore uses optimistic concurrency to manage transactions. When   two or more application instances try to change the same entity group   at the same time either by updating existing entities or by creating   new ones, the first application to commit its changes will succeed   and all others will fail on commit. These other applications can then   try their transactions again to apply them to the updated data. Note   that because the Datastore works this way, using entity groups limits   the number of concurrent writes you can do to any entity in a given   group.p blockquote  pDoes this mean that if two different users from two different devices try to modify the same object, only one of them will succeed Is this typical database behavior, or just a GAE limitation How do other databases usually handle such situations, where two or more users try to modify the same objectp  pAnd what does it mean by the fact that when two or more application instances try to create new entities, only one will succeed. Am I understanding that wrong No two application instances can add a new object to the same tablep

Negative 21772 pIm trying to use Bullet Physics for collision detection only. I dont need it to move any objects for me or handle rendering with callbacks. I just want to update object locations every frame and use it to tell me when I have collisions. To get the simplest example going, Im trying to find collisions between objects with btBoxShape as their shape. Everything runs fine without crashes or apparent memory leaks, but I get no collisions so I must be making some mistakes somewhere. Ill try to keep this as brief as I can without leaving anything important out.p  pHeres my world setup functionp  precodecollisionConfig       new btDefaultCollisionConfiguration dispatcher            new btCollisionDispatchercollisionConfig overlappingPairCache  new btDbvtBroadphase solver                new btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver dynamicsWorld         new btDiscreteDynamicsWorlddispatcher,  overlappingPairCache, solver, collisionConfig           dynamicsWorldgtsetGravitybtVector30.0f, 9.8f, 0.0f codepre  pRight now I have player and enemy objects of the type btCollisionObject.

Negative 21772 pIve built myself a Rails Engine that requires that the main app have a Users table. I need to be able to create a relationship between one of the models in my engine and the Users table in the main app. Is this more complicated than just saying codebelongsto usercode Im getting an error that says the codeUsercode object is nil, but when I use the console it returns the right user. My assumption is that Rails assumed my codebelongsto usercode call meant a Users class in the same namespace as the engine, i.e. MyEngineUser.

Negative 21772 pSomething weird has happened.  Ive written a Java program, where Ive done nothing to handle uncaught exceptions in any special way.  But when I run this one particular program in Windows 7, there is this uncaught exception in a static context called from main that causes a window to pop up, displaying the exception.  I have tried to write a small program to duplicate this effect to no avail.  One program which I have written entirely by hand produces a popup, while no others will do the same.p  pId like to track this down particularly so that I can add code that makes other CAUGHT exceptions display the stack trace in a similar way.p  pIve asked about this in IRC, but people tell me that this doesnt happen.  Well, it DID happen.  There is a screenshot below.  p  pI think my only hope is if someone else recognizes this and can tell me where it comes from.p  pThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVZVbD.png altJava exceptionp  pUPDATE  Sorry for the delay getting some code.  I had to attend to a colicky infant.  Please note that this is a desktop Java app.  Its not an applet, and it doesnt use webstart.p  pHere is code copied and pasted from the program that gets the dialog.  Ill do another edit to let you know whether or not my colleague who gets the exception gets the dialog for this case.  Ive been careful to include everything leading up to the exception.  Only the IPAddress class implementation is missing, but that doesnt participate in the exception, because its not actually used until after the exception occurs.  Note the asterisks before the line where the exception occurs. That line of code corresponds with the exception you can see in the screenshot.p  precodepackage staticexception  import java.net.InterfaceAddress import java.net.NetworkInterface import java.net.SocketException import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Collections import java.util.Enumeration import java.util.List import javax.swing.UIManager  public class StaticException       Dont need this fully implemented.     public static class IPAddress           public static IPAddress getBroadcastIPAddress mask, IPAddress myip              return new IPAddress                   public IPAddress           public IPAddressint maskval           public IPAddressbyte[] addr           public IPAddress maskIPAddress netmask              return this                   public int prefixLength              return 0                     public static class Network          public IPAddress broadcast, netmask, ip         boolean remember          public NetworkIPAddress br, IPAddress nm, IPAddress ip              broadcast  br             netmask  nm             this.ip  ip                   boolean matchIPAddress ip              IPAddress a  ip.masknetmask             IPAddress b  this.ip.masknetmask             return a.equalsb                   Override         public String toString              return ip.toString    netmask.prefixLength                    static ListltNetworkgt mynetworks      static void enumerateNetworks          mynetworks  new ArrayListltNetworkgt          EnumerationltNetworkInterfacegt nets  null         try              nets  NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces          catch SocketException ex              ex.printStackTrace                  for NetworkInterface netint  Collections.listnets              for InterfaceAddress address  netint.getInterfaceAddresses                    Exception would occur on the next line when                    address.getAddress would return null                 byte[] addr  address.getAddress.getAddress                 if addr.length  4 ampamp addr[0]  127                      int prefixlen  address.getNetworkPrefixLength                     int maskval  1 ltlt 32  prefixlen                     IPAddress mask  new IPAddressmaskval                     mynetmask  mask                     System.out.printlnNetmask      mask                      IPAddress myip  new IPAddressaddr                     myipaddress  myip                     System.out.printlnLocal IP     myip                      IPAddress broadcast  IPAddress.getBroadcastmask, myip                     System.out.printlnBroadcast    broadcast                      mynetworks.addnew Networkbroadcast, mask, myip                      System.out.printaddress.getAddress.getAddress.length                        System.out.printaddress.getAddress                        System.out.printaddress.getAddress.getHostAddress                        System.out.printlnaddress.getNetworkPrefixLength                                                  static private void setupNetwork          System.setPropertyjava.net.preferIPv4Stack,true          enumerateNetworks           ... stuff that would happen after the exception           public static void mainString[] args          try                       UIManager.setLookAndFeelUIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName               catch Exception e           setupNetwork           ... stuff that would happen after the exception       codepre  pSECOND UPDATE  My colleague reports that this program does NOT produce the dialog.  The only difference between this and the program that gets the popup is that the program that gets the popup is being launched from an exe wrapper produced by AdvancedInstaller.  Besides that, within the Java program, the sequence of execution is identical.  Ive googled this, and as far as I can find, AdvancedInstaller does nothing at all that would result in this popup being generated.  Im not sure that it CAN without modifying the Java program which it doesnt, because Im not sure that you can do anything from outside the Java program to make this happen.  Except perhaps capture stderr, but that doesnt explain why other programs wrapped by AdvancedInstaller dont produce this popup or why later exceptions produced by this application also do not produce this popup.p

Also worth mentioning that the animSpeed is ignored for some transitions, it stays at at least 500 even more perhaps sometimes.p  pCode for firing the pluginp  precodewindow.loadfunction    slider.nivoSlider       effect boxRandom,       animSpeed 500,       pauseTime 51000,       directionNav true,       controlNav false,       pauseOnHover true,       prevText Prev,       nextText Next,       randomStart true,     codepre  pHTML codep  precodeltdiv idslider classnivoSlidergt     lta hrefgt ltimg srcvalidsource1.jpg alt gt ltagt     lta hrefgt ltimg srcvalidsource2.jpg alt gt ltagt     lta hrefgt ltimg srcvalidsource3.jpg alt gt ltagt     lta hrefgt ltimg srcvalidsource4.jpg alt gt ltagt ltdivgt lt slidergt codepre  pAny ideasp

Negative 21772 pI recently converted some slow python code into a C extension. It works beautifully, except that it generates a segfault at the 162nd call into it, right at the return statement.p  pHeres how it works. Once, prior to all of the calls to the function I want to compute, I load the data into memory remembering to INCREF the parent objectp  precodestatic PyObject grmloadDosagePyObject self, PyObject args     Load the dosage matrix into global memory  Global variables DOSAGESPYMAT  will be a pointer to the PyArrayObject of the dosage array must incref this                    DOSAGES  will be a pointer to the double array underlying DOSAGESPYMAT    PyArrayObject dosageMatrixArr  if   PyArgParseTupleargs,O,ampDOSAGESPYMATOBJ  return NULL  if  NULL  DOSAGESPYMATOBJ  return NULL   PyINCREFDOSAGESPYMATOBJ    from PyObject to Python Array   dosageMatrixArr  pymatrixDOSAGESPYMATOBJ   get the row and col sizes   NVARIANTS  dosageMatrixArrgtdimensions[0]  NSAMPLES  dosageMatrixArrgtdimensions[1]  DOSAGES  pymatrixtoCarraydosageMatrixArr  PyRETURNTRUE  codepre  psee a hrefhttpwww.scipy.orgCookbookCExtensionsNumPyarrays relnofollowhttpwww.scipy.orgCookbookCExtensionsNumPyarraysa for the Carray method. I then reference the loaded double[][], DOSAGES in the function I will call from pythonp  precodestatic PyObject grmcalcdistancePyObject self, PyObject args    Given column indeces samples of DOSAGES, and an array of row indeces the variants missing for one or both,      calculate the distance   int samI,samJ,nMissing, missing  PyObject missingObj  PyArrayObject missingArr  printfdebug1n  if   PyArgParseTupleargs,iiOi,ampsamI,ampsamJ,ampmissingObj,ampnMissing  return NULL  if  NULL  missingObj  return NULL  missingArr  pyvectormissingObj  missing  pyvectortoCarraymissingArr  double replaced1[nMissing]  double replaced2[nMissing]  printfdebug2n   int missingVectorIdx  int missingVariantIdx   for each sample, store the dosage at the missing site as it could be missing   in the OTHER sample, and replace it with 0.0 in the dosage matrix  for  missingVectorIdx  0 missingVectorIdx lt nMissing missingVectorIdx     printfdebugA d lt dn,missingVectorIdx,nMissing   missingVariantIdx  missing[missingVectorIdx]   replaced1[missingVariantIdx]  DOSAGES[missingVariantIdx][samI]   replaced2[missingVariantIdx]  DOSAGES[missingVariantIdx][samJ]   printfdebugBn   DOSAGES[missingVariantIdx][samI]0.0   DOSAGES[missingVariantIdx][samJ]0.0      calculate the distance this uses DOSAGES which we just modified  double distance  calcDistancesamI,samJ   printfdebug3n   put the values that we replaced with 0.0 back into the matrix  for  missingVectorIdx  0 missingVectorIdx lt nMissing missingVectorIdx     missingVariantIdx  missing[missingVectorIdx]   DOSAGES[missingVariantIdx][samI]  replaced1[missingVariantIdx]   DOSAGES[missingVariantIdx][samJ]  replaced2[missingVariantIdx]    printfdebug4 fn,distance   grab the python object wrapper and return it  PyObject  distPy  PyFloatFromDoubledoubledistance  printfdebug5n  if  NULL  distPy    printfand is NULLn  return distPy   codepre  pWith tons of debug statements that you see, Ive localized the segfault to the return statement. That is, after the instantiation of the python float object, but somewhere between calling return from C, and the next executed line of python which is, you guessed it, a printdebugReturned. What I see in stdout isp  precodedebug4 0.025160 debug5 Segmentation fault codepre  pSo the double is not a strange value, the python object is properly created, its not NULL, but theres some error between returning from C, and continuing in python. Sources online suggest that this might be a INCREFDECREF problem, but also state that PyFloatFromDouble and PyBuildValuef,double generate new references, so dont need to be INCREFd. Both choices generate this same result. While Im reasonably certain that I need to INCREF the PyObject holding my matrix during my grmloadDosage function, Ive tried both with and without that INCREF, with the same behavior.p  pAny ideas whats going onp  pThanksp  pAlso, a stacktracep  precode0  0x0000000000000000 in   1  0x000000000045aa5c in PyEvalEvalFrameEx f0x2aaae1ae3f60, throwflagltvalue optimized outgt at Pythonceval.c2515 2  0x000000000045ecb4 in callfunction f0x3fb7494970227c55, throwflagltvalue optimized outgt at Pythonceval.c4009 3  PyEvalEvalFrameEx f0x3fb7494970227c55, throwflagltvalue optimized outgt at Pythonceval.c2692 4  0x000000000045ecb4 in callfunction f0x95c880, throwflagltvalue optimized outgt at Pythonceval.c4009 5  PyEvalEvalFrameEx f0x95c880, throwflagltvalue optimized outgt at Pythonceval.c2692 6  0x000000000045f626 in PyEvalEvalCodeEx co0x98abe0, globalsltvalue optimized outgt, localsltvalue optimized outgt, args0x0, argcount0, kws0x0, kwcount0, defs0x0, defcount0, kwdefs0x0,     closure0x0 at Pythonceval.c3350 7  0x000000000045f74b in PyEvalEvalCode co0x146b098, globals0x71, locals0xc7 at Pythonceval.c767 8  0x0000000000482fab in runmod fp0x881b80, filename0x2aaaae257de0 humgengsahphome1chartlprojectst2dgctaresourcesbincGRMcalculateGRM.py, startltvalue optimized outgt,     globals0x81e340, locals0x81e340, closeit1, flags0x7fffffffbfd0 at Pythonpythonrun.c1783 9  PyRunFileExFlags fp0x881b80, filename0x2aaaae257de0 humgengsahphome1chartlprojectst2dgctaresourcesbincGRMcalculateGRM.py, startltvalue optimized outgt, globals0x81e340,     locals0x81e340, closeit1, flags0x7fffffffbfd0 at Pythonpythonrun.c1740 10 0x0000000000483268 in PyRunSimpleFileExFlags fpltvalue optimized outgt, filename0x2aaaae257de0 humgengsahphome1chartlprojectst2dgctaresourcesbincGRMcalculateGRM.py, closeit1,     flags0x7fffffffbfd0 at Pythonpythonrun.c1265 11 0x00000000004964d7 in runfile argcltvalue optimized outgt, argv0x7df010 at Modulesmain.c297 12 PyMain argcltvalue optimized outgt, argv0x7df010 at Modulesmain.c692 13 0x000000000041563e in main argc11, argv0x7fffffffc148 at .Modulespython.c59 codepre

Negative 21772 pIm fairly new to NodeJSusing c9.io and have this sick obsession with it lately.  p  pI would like to know while using NodeJS.  Is it possible to stream the contents of a basic html page, not large, and not special to lets say 10 concurrent users.  However if there is a change to that html page the users will instantly see the changes.  This can be based on whatever event but basically on the file contents being updated.  Im really hoping to create some simple prototype to impress the boss and do it with NodeJS with hopes to get ride of our current outdated use of setInterval ajax posts. pukep  ol liWhat is the name of this process because i keep hearing different names.li liIs it Possibleli liWhat else would i need in addition to NodeJSli liWhere is a good starting pointli ol  pThanksp

Negative 21772 pCurrently Im working on a DirectShow based application for configuring TV capture cards. Its supposed to work with most of the capture cards out there, so it has to be as generic as possible.p  pSince most capture card manufacturers seem to come up with different ways of configuration, my application will try to analyse the related filters and their pins.

Negative 21772 pIm writing an application which connects to an external rtmp server to get a live stream. Opening the file with firefox over the localhost apache 2.2 server works fine and Im getting the stream. But if Im opening the file with the file protocol file I will get the error NetConnection.Connect.Rejected and then NetConnection.Connect.Closed.p  pIm assuming this happens because of some security restrictions of the flash player and have set the flash file as trusted in etcadobeFlashPlayerTrusttrusted.cfg after the change Security.sandboxType is returning localTrusted. But even with this change the connection still gets rejected. The rtmp address contains the port 1935 and I have also tried to use the rtmpt protocol but in this case Im getting the error NetConnection.Connect.Failed.p  pThe only event handler that gets thrown is NetStatusEvent so there is no security exception. I have already read many documentations and looked for hours but I cant figure out why this doesnt work.p

Negative 21772 pIm using the Web Audio API to make a graphic EQ with four BiQuad filters a highpass, two bandpass and a low passp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFjZOU.png altenter image description herep  pYou can see each node representing each filters frequency. Its working nicely but Id like to draw the shape of the filters rolloff youd usually find in other graphic EQs.p  pI have the Qfactor of each filter and the central frequency. What I would like to do is get a formula that allows me to get the frequency of the rolloff at a specific db value. For example what is the frequency of the rolloff at 200dbp  pIts been a while since Ive done any heavy mathematical stuff and so any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 21772 pBefore I start I just want to say that I understand the auto layout constraints to a point where Im happy to use them in IB and code to create what I want.p  pThe issue I have, which I find very frustrating is that in IB I have a view set up with some labels, images and buttons positioned using auto layout just as I want them, great. p  pI then realise that I need to add one more label to the view... if I drag a label into that view IB will then add and remove constraints freely within that view to fit this new object. I then have to add all my custom constraints again and remove the ones automatically added.p  pI just wanted to know if Im missing something. Is there a way to drag a new object into a view without the existing constraints being ruined, or is this just something that we all have to deal withp  pthanks Stewartp

Negative 21772 pThe Spring Cache abstraction allows you to easily cache the results of method but when it comes to collections, AFAIC, it just caches the collection result which is not always efficient when many users share elements in the collection.p  pWhat Im looking for is a good way to create a readthrough cache. And Im looking for some suggestions how best to do it. p  pIn this scenario Im retrieving postsings from various users imagine FB wall. The posts have aspects that are common for each user title, description, photo of the poster etc. But also things that are individual to the user You and 3 of your friends like this.p  pMy Service Layer basically has methods such as thisp  precodepublic ListltPostgt getPostsUser user, int start, int max    get the ids     ListltLonggt ids  dao.getPostIdsuser, start, max     get the associated posts    ListltPostgt posts  dao.getPostsids     personalize result    return convertposts, user  codepre  pThe Post objects are derivatives of the Hibernate managed Post Entity. I always feel that getting the entire Hibernate managed entity with all its lazy collections and sometimes unwanted initialization is not the ideal candidate for large volume reads, so I project the values of those entities to a simple Post bean. If anyone has any thoughts on the sense of that it would be interesting also.p  pPostIds are things that update very frequently as new posts come in. The posts themselves can be shared amongst users as you will see some of the same posts as your friends. Conversions are unique to the end user.p  pSo, I would like to be able the cache to support this. A short lived id cache and a LFU post cache.  This is more or less the way that the second level Hibernate cache works, but unless someone can convince me otherwise, thats out. Also I want to use this a little higher up the chain so that we can cache objects and not just arrays of values that have to be hydrated to objects on each request.p  pSo, the LFU cache would have to be able to see if any of the idposts are in its cache and retrieve any missing items from the database in a separate getPostsids for the missing ones, put them in the cache and the whole thing returns a result.p  pIs there a good way of doing this that doesnt require lots of wheels to be invented Most if not all of the documentation seems to be focused on just caching the entire result of a method without some describing how to achieve this more fine grained read through approach.p  pAny suggestions are appreciated.p  pKind regards, Marcp
Negative 21772 pThis one has me wondering whats going on, has been a couple of days already..p  pI have been delevoping a concept app on xcode and relying on the iOS Simulator initially, then I started testing it on the iPhone ans something rather odd happens.p  pWhen I look in the simulator I have the screenp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMz8x9.png altenter image description herep  pWhich is exactly how I wanted to look, but then I load it in the iPhone and I see this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3TzIt.png altenter image description herep  pWhere one can clearly see that the arrows are missing, this also happens for the header bar etc. Also the arrows seem a bit off on the iOS Simulator  this is replicable when I open the site on Chrome.p  pAny ideas on this issuep  pThank you again in advancep
Negative 21772 pDoes anyone know if the function a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36689028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowVirtualAllocExa from the API Win32 could alloc more than one page when we call it p  pFor example I want to allocate 100Mo.

Negative 21772 pBasically I have a website that will run a background task to perform some maintenance duties while its not idle. When it is idle, these processes do not need to run.p  pNow I have a secondary website virtual directory under main site that needs to execute these tasks as well. However they cant both run them at the same time or it will cause issues.p  pNow the more correct solution would probably be to either merge the sites, break out the tasks into a different application, or change the tasks so that they do not conflict with each other if theyre both running at the same time. For one reason or another, these are not currently options.p  pSo basically when the secondary website is active, what would be the best way to make sure the primary website is awake and running these tasksp  pIm thinking the easiest solution would be to include a reference to the main website from the secondary website, so that any page load on the secondary website would force the first website to be server the request. Something like a 1px image.p  pBut would this be better solved through IIS Should they share the same application pool Both applications are relatively stable, so Im not too worried about one website bringing down the other.p

Negative 21772 pI am working on an really large multi language project 1000 Classes  Configs  Scripts, with files distributed over network drives. I am having trouble fighting through the code, since the available Tools are not helping. The main problem is finding things. For the C Part VS with VAX can only find files and symbols which are in the solution. A lot of them are not. Same problem with Reshaper. Right now i am stuck with doing unindexed string and file searches, which is highly inefficient on a network drive.

Negative 21772 pI am designing a REST service for my company. No one here has had much experience with REST so I read through a few books on the subject but I am stuck on resource design of a POST vs. the resource design of a GET request for the same data. Particularly in the case of foreign relationships. p  pFor instance I have a class PurchaseRequest which represents a request to purchase some fixed asset. Behind the scenes my service is an interface to a relational DB. There is a PURCHASEREQUEST table which has a foreign key to an ASSET table Defining which of a fixed list of assets are being requested and a PERSON table Defining which of the users is doing the requesting. Currently in my service when a GET command is issued for a purchase request, the service returns the whole thing An XML representation of the PURCHASEREQUEST table entry along with a list of asset entries like sop  precodeltPurchaseRequestgt     ltIDgtltIDgt     ltRequestDategtltRequestDategt     ltRequestor hrefrequestorsrequestorIDgt         ltRequestorIDgtltRequestorIDgt         ltFirstNamegtltFirstNamegt         ltLastNamegtltLastNamegt     ltRequestorgt     ltRequestedAssetsgt         ltRequestedAsset hrefassetsAssetNumber gt             ltAssetNumbergtltAssetNumbergt             ltYeargtltYeargt             ltMakegtltMakegt             ltModelgtltModelgt             ltCostgtltCostgt         ltRequestedAssetgt         ltRequestedAsset hrefassetsAssetNumber gt             ltAssetNumbergtltAssetNumbergt             ltYeargtltYeargt             ltMakegtltMakegt             ltModelgtltModelgt             ltCostgtltCostgt         ltRequestedAssetgt         ltRequestedAsset hrefassetsAssetNumber gt             ltAssetNumbergtltAssetNumbergt             ltYeargtltYeargt             ltMakegtltMakegt             ltModelgtltModelgt             ltCostgtltCostgt         ltRequestedAssetgt     ltRequestedAssetsgt ltPurchaseRequestgt codepre  pThis works pretty efficiently. The consuming application makes a single request and gets the whole thing and links to the full resource requestor resource or asset resource if they need them.p  pThe problem comes on a POST. My gut tells me to try to use the same resource layout for POSTing a new purchase request as I used to retrieve an existing one. This is what all the examples in the books I have read do anyway. I dont need to know anything more than the Asset Number and Requestor ID to fulfill the POST. That means that data is not necessary but the inefficiency alone is not what bothers me. The main thing is you should not be able to edit the year, make or model of an asset when creating a purchase request, those fields are predefined. You also should be able to create a new asset definition when creating a purchase request. Similarly you should not be able to updatecreate a persons details when creating a purchase request. There are separate services for creatingupdating people and assets. p  pThe only thing I can think of is to define a different DataContract class for the POST which has the minimum info to identify an asset or a person and does not expose those fields which cannot be updated. I really dont love this option because it is going to create a large number of DataContracts  classes nearly all of the tables in my DB have foreign relationships, this is not isolated to one request or I would not be worrying about it However I really dont love my current design because REST does not have readonly fields.The burden is now on the consumers of my service to constantly be checking,  does it save this field what about this one... Has anyone else ran into this issue Is it common to have to define a separate DataContract class for POSTing and GETing Seems like a pretty basic design question but I dont see a lot of posts out there on the subject so I am hoping I just missed something. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 21772 pFirst, I apologize if my question is unclear.  The Googling and book reading I have been doing over the past couple weeks on this topic has not revealed any terminology for the problem I am trying to solve.  I will describe my problem as best I can if anyone knows the proper jargon to help me more concisely express my problem, please let me know.p  pI am doing some research into how feasible it is to use voxels to represent largish 256x256x256 voxels battlegrounds with destructible terrain for serverhosted multiplayer games.  Only one battleground will exist for any game at a time.  However, to be able to broadcast rooms and changes to their terrain, I am trying to find an algorithm that can group the voxels into the fewest rectangular blocks as possible.  As a simplistic example, if the bottom half of the level was completely filled with voxels of one type and the top half with voxels of another type, the level should be divided into two blocks, one representing the bottom half of the level, and the other representing the top.  Ideally, this algorithm should be able to run in real time so any deformation in the terrain could be accounted for on a perframe basis and broadcast to the clients.  This should enable the clients to render the terrain efficiently without worrying about duplicating terrain destruction logic in the clients.p  pI have not found any articles anywhere on how to do this.  I have tried looking for articles on voxel engines I dont think chunking is good enough for my needs.  I have looked at books and articles on data mining, but without knowing the correct terminology for my problem, I havent been able to search effectively.  Ive even looked at emComputational Geometry in C Second Editionem by Joseph ORourke, but it does not seem to have anything to help.p  pHere are the approaches I have tried and the problems I find with them.  The block counts reported are for filling a 2563 space by randomly dropping more than 4,194,304 EARTH voxels into as far close to the bottom as they can go for the randomly selected x,z coordinate.  Only EARTH blocks are counted.p  ul liOctrees very fast, but if I split at the middle of a space, it produces a ridiculously large number of blocks 800,000li likD trees splitting to minimize weighted entropy after a split slightly slower than octrees, but much fewer blocks 350,000li likD trees splitting to maximize information gain ratio twice as fast as than the previous kD trees method, generating far fewer blocks 167,000, but still to slowli likD trees splitting to minimize Gower similarity very slow, but generates fewer blocks than any other kD tree method 155,000li ligreedily grabbing the largest subset of nonintersecting, largest volume blocks available when considering each unclaimed EARTH block as the blocks defining point even threaded, this algorithm is obscenely slow 16 minutes with 8 threads on an 8core system, but it generates the fewest blocks of all lt65,536li ligreedily grabbing the largest subset of nonintersecting blocks while treating a blocks dimensions as objective scores to maximize much slower than the other greedy approach and generates a few thousand more blocks, tooli ul  pConsidering that a maximum acceptable number of blocks is one block per x,y coordinate to represent a single column, only the greedy volume is having results that could be considered even close to optimal.p  pI do not know how to compute the minimum block count without using a brute force approach that never ends, so I do not know whether it is possible to do better than the greedy volume approach.  Furthermore, I do not know how I can make it any faster.p  pCan anyone give me an algorithm to try or at least point me in the right direction  Id like to stop exploring this direction and think of another way to approach my problem if this cannot be done any better.p

Negative 21772 pIm using Fluent NHibernate to write to an Oracle 11g database.   Im not sure if its a problem, but the NHibernate drivers have only configuration settings for 9 and 10g databases.  Anyways, when I had instantiated only one NHibernate SessionFactory and only one NHibernate session a used both a regular session and a IStatelessSession.   Anytime I performed a read or write to the database, the Oracle sys.aud table would have a log of the transactions being performed.  Our DBA said it was because the connection was logging in and then logging off after each read or write transaction.  With a large amount of queries, we would end up killing the audit table.  Were going to create a second database user with tweaked auditing for that account, but is it the default nature for NHibernate to close and open the connection for each transaction  Is there a way to prevent the connection from logging in and logging offp  pHeres the SessionFactory configurationp  precodepublic static ISessionFactory getSessionFactory          var cfg  FluentNHibernate.Cfg.Db.OracleClientConfiguration.Oracle10         cfg.ConnectionStringc gt              c.Instance...             c.Username...             c.Password...             c.Server...                    return Fluently.Configure.Databasecfg.Mappingsm gt              m.FluentMappings.AddltDummyDataMapgt         .BuildSessionFactory      codepre  pand heres the Main method for the tests I wrotep  precode static void Mainstring[] args          try              var sessionFactory  getSessionFactory              using var statelessSession  sessionFactory.OpenStatelessSession                  for int i  0 i lt 1000 i                      var dd  new DummyData                     dd.FIRSTCOLUMN  i                     using var t  statelessSession.BeginTransaction                          statelessSession.Insertdd                         t.Commit                                                                using var statefulSession  sessionFactory.OpenSession                  for int i  0 i lt 1000 i                      var dd  new DummyData                     dd.FIRSTCOLUMN  i                     using var t  statefulSession.BeginTransaction                          statefulSession.Savedd                         t.Commit                                                                 using var statefulSession  sessionFactory.OpenSession                   for int i  0 i lt 1000 i                      statefulSession.QueryltDummyDatagt.Wheredd gt dd.FIRSTCOLUMN  i.ForEachdd gt                         Console.Out.WriteLinedd.FIRSTCOLUMN                                        catch Exception ex              Console.Out.WriteLineex.Message          codepre

When the codedetailDisclosureIndicatorcode is pressed, it pushes a new controller, changes the subtitle text, then pops that view controller and returns to codeallone.hcode. The problem is, it still shows the codedetailDisclosureIndicatorcode even strongif the text  hello, worldstrong. I tried changing the style in codeviewWillAppearcode, but I dont have access to cell. p  pHere is my code.p  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  populate cells with stuff      if[cell.detailTextLabel.text isEqualToStringhello, world]        cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailDisclosureButton       codepre  pSo I guess my question is, how do I change the accessory type embackem once I return to codeallone.hcode and the cells text is no longer hello, worldp

What could be the reasons for this I believe the skipping frames problem is probably due to the fact that I have used codewriteShortcode function to write out each element of the short array that stores the audio sample data separately, but if that is the case please suggest a workaround to it that involves writing data as shorts and not using the codewritebyte[]code function, because I need to use parts of this code in my main project which involves obtaining audio samples in a short array. Also why is it speeded upp

In this form there should be a button to test the connect and another button to save the user changes to the connection parameters. p  p3 how to share the connection, created by the class we made in point 1,  between different forms in the application.

Negative 21772 pTitle pretty much sums it up. p  pI have a factory class that will construct an instance of another class when its codecreatecode method is called.

Negative 21772 pI have this basic textchecking code that has worked fine up until iOS 7p  precode   NSMutableCharacterSettestchars[NSCharacterSet alphanumericCharacterSet]   [testchars addCharactersInString.]    BOOL didFindBadCharacters  [userInput rangeOfCharacterFromSet[testchars invertedSet]].location  NSNotFound codepre  pThe simple idea here is to check the users input which is codeuserInputcode and find a BOOL that is codetruecode if any of the characters the user entered are emnotem alphanumeric or contain a dot or dash. That is, those entries are fine, but a space, or a symbol, are not fine.p  pUntil iOS 7, this worked. I dont understand why this would be different with iOS 7, but now if the user enters a dot or a dash, the BOOL returns as codetruecode when Ive logged to make sure there is no other character, such as a space, triggering the error instead.p  pWhy would this fail on iOS 7 Seems like basic language features.p

Negative 21772 pWe use C SQLDriverConnect to connect to our backend MS SQL Server. Via the attributes it is possible to set a parameter for a login timeout SQLATTRLOGINTIMEOUT, which, defines how long it takes before the SQLDriverConnect which is kind of the login takes.p  pNow, if I stop the SQL service on the server, this timeout is respected, and exactly after X seconds after calling the function I wil get my connect faillure, which is of course correct. However, if I do not stop the service, but, disable the network adapter from the server, our pull out the network cable of the server, the SQLDriverConnect does not respect this timeout, and only returns a lot later. p  pFor example, when setting the timeout to 5 seconds, the SQLDriverConnect only returns after 53 seconds if the SQL server is down. p  pI know this can be solved by making my own asynchronous connect, which I can always make return after X seconds, but, if possible, I would prefer not to do this and just use the provided functions and options to control the connection.p  pI assume the delay is caused by the network stack that is trying to find the host, but, my idea is that we use a higher level API with a timeout just to make sure we dont have to worry about those kind of things...p  pAny ideas on how this can be fixed p  pthx in advancep  pWimp

Negative 21772 pWe have a mobile app built using phonegap accessing data from a REST API. This rest API has an authorization token specific to us  provided by them after registering with them. Now, we are using the API access URL with the token issued.p  pE.g. codehttpapi.something.comcitiesbuildingsauthtokenblahblahcode. We are able to get the data through an AJAX request  which obviously has a SUCCESS and an ERROR callback function.p  pI understand now that there is an expiry for this session, and this is where I am stuck. My AJAX request fails and the control goes to the ERROR callback after a few mins. In my whole app, I do not have a login screen I dont want to have one. p  pThe AJAX request is being called on a button click. So, when I click this button for the first time, my data comes out successfully. But when my session expires, I get an error message the message that I defined in my AJAX error callback. Here, if I click the same button again, the session gets established and I am getting my data again.p  pShortly  p  pStep 1. Click the button  Data retrieval successfulp  pStep 2. Session expiresp  pStep 3. Click the button  Error message appearsp  pStep 4.

Negative 21772 pIt seems intuitive that one should be able to use sets of sets, and indeed codestdsetcode is designed to support such use by default since lexicographical ordering is implemented by default. Similarly, it seems reasonable to expect the same feature of codeboostunorderedsetcode.

Negative 21772 pI have a large class, lets call it Country. It has all kinds of properties like List States, Age, etc.p  pIn real life, I am working on an ASP.NET application in which a user enrolls into a subscription for a service our client provides. This application form they need to fill out has many many properties and one of the main classes representing the data model is becoming too bloated, and so I want to break it into small classes via composition but still have properties on the subclasses linked to the parent class.p  pFor this example to keep things simple and refer to the car example. So we have a class called Country that looks like thisp  precodepublic static class WorldDatabase      public static ListltCountrygt Countries getset   class Country      public int Age getset     public string Namegetset     public ListltStategt Statesgetset   class State      public string CountryNamegetset     public string Capitolgetset     public Listltstringgt Citiesgetset  codepre  pNow, creating a quick sample of the setupp  precodevar states  new ListltStatesgt states.Addnew StateCountryNameUnited States,                        StateNameNJ,                        CapitolTrenton  WorldDatabase.Countries.Addnew CountryAge237,                                  NameUnited States,                                  Statesstates  WorldDatabase.Countries[0].NameUS  assert obviously fails because the names are not linked Assert.IsEqualWorldDatabase.Countries[0].Name  states[0].CountryName codepre  pSo the problem Im trying to solve whats the best way to link the two properties The way I came up with is injecting an instance of the parent Country into the State class. But Im concerned about the child making changes to the parent when he shouldnt be. Also, it seems like there might be a way to do this with less code that Im not aware of. Heres the two ways I came up withp  precodedoes a onetime binding class State      public void BindFromCountry country               CountryNamecountry.Name          public string CountryNamegetset     public string Capitolgetset     public Listltstringgt Citiesgetset   tracks the parent forever class State      private readonly Country parent     public StateCountry parent               parent  parent           public string CountryName           get               return parent.Name                   public string Capitolgetset     public Listltstringgt Citiesgetset  codepre  pWhats the name of this pattern if it is one Id like to read more about it.. and is there an alternativep

Negative 21772 pIm using OSX 10.9, iTerm2, Emacs Prelude, and Clojure with all the modes that entails most relevantly, codesmartparenscode. Good so far. p  pThe short version is has anybody out there found a harmonious way to use all of this together with OSX Mission Control p  pThe longer version goes I want to be able to use commands like codespforwardslurpsexpcode, which has a default keybinding of codeCltrightgtcode, better known as the default OSlevel shortcut for switch Spaces right via Mission Control. I can remap that fairly easily say, to codeCShiftltrightgtcode  but now, I discover that codeCltrightgtcode actually seems to be sending something like codeM[14Acode. Instead of triggering codespforwardslurpsexpcode, you get codespwrapwithpair [code. Uhm.p  pI dug up this a hrefhttpoffbytwo.com20120115emacspluspareditunderterminal.html relnofollowdissertation on remapping keysa, which is very thorough, but also involves remapping rather a deal of stuff, then disabling the parts of codepareditcode that are listening for the codeM[code command. While this technically seems to work, I actually rather like having codespwrapwithpaircode enabled. Perhaps a better option would be to embrace the theoretically equivalent codeCcode  except iTerm2 only interprets that as a literal 9, and codeCcode as 0. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6260754justgettingusedtopareditinemacsonosxhowcomecdoesntworkThis SO posta chews on this problem, and gets as far as a tantalizing comment suggesting that codeCcode and codeCcode simply be remapped to escape sequences that emacs can map embackem to codeCcode and codeCcode  but frankly, I havent a clue how to figure out what escape sequences those should be. p  pBringing it all home has anybody found a way to use all of these tools Mission Control, iTerm2, Emacs Prelude, smartparens together without having to rewire or disable parts of some or most of them Or who has the most elegant rewiring Anybody figured out the codeCcodetoescapesequencebacktocodeCcode trick yetp  pstrongEditstrongp  pStabbing in the dark, Ive done the following 1.

Negative 21772 pI have spent quite a bit of time researching the different Python frameworks for neo4j i.e. neo4django, bulbflow, py2neo, and have been very impressed at how they are able to abstract the functionality to make it feel like working with familiar relational databases.  The question I have is around setting up a stack that allows for some of this abstraction for things like model creation, oauth, and basic querying but to incorporate graphbased algorithms for data analysis, more detailed traversals and path finding, etc.p  pIs there a recommended or tried approach for creating a robust RESTful API with the available libraries and capabilities of Django, and the freedom to drop down to the lower level neo4j API when necessary  Having some control over the cypher queries would be great, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel if something like neo4django has already implemented the basics very well.  It is a bit daunting deciding how to set this all up from scratch, and there seem to be a lot of possibilities, so any advice is greatly appreciated.p  pFor example, since py2neo is built on top of the neo4j REST API, and I then use it to work with Django and Tastypie as a separate REST API, which is accessed by a mobile or web app, do these layers of abstraction get redundant or even start to take away from the usefulness  Again, any input from people who have worked with graph databases and python is definitely helpful.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I would also really like to take advantage of some of the neo4j libraries out there, such as spatial, so the extra abstraction in some of the existing solutions may be counterproductive  again, Im not sure thoughp

Negative 21772 pFor well over a year and a half I have been running Apache using HTTPD, naturally through WAMP without issue, or at least no issues like this. On this system, we host around 8 or so different web sites and a few applications that use the MySQL database. p  pRecently I had a full system crash and when I rebuilt the system on the same operating system with the same versions of Apache, MySQL, and PHP and nearidentical configuration files.p  pThe issue I am having is this On startup our web services initially seem to work fine, and this can hold over for an hour or so, sometimes less, sometimes more. However after some period of time, all web sites suddenly become entirely unavailable, to include the localhost landing on the web server itself or any local browsing for that matter. Apache identifies as still running, remains listening on port 80, and has no abnormal access or error logs to include in debug mode.p  pIve gone over this quite a few times, reinstalled WAMP and have interchanged different versions of Apache. Additionally Ive vetted the configuration files compared to the old system and have ensured that the modules, extensions, and so on are the same as our previous version.p  pI would really appreciate any insight as I continue to rack my head over what might be causing this erroneous issue. p  pp  pSome additional details and notes that might prove insightful.p  ul liIve ensured the firewall isnt an issue, plus that wouldnt explain the sudden downtime or downtime at the localhost.li liA restart of just the Apache service tends to fix the issue, but only for a little while.li liBecause we host multiple web sites, we do use virtual hosts.

This works as intended, however Im now testing everything considering existing data. p  pSo I basically created a codevariables.phpcode file that sets values to the codeSESSIONcode global and was working from there. Everything was working as expected on codeindex.phpcode, but as soon as I click the overlay I notice the values arent passing through to populate the form that was added.p  pI already poked google for a few hours to no avail. Ive added codeecho vardumpSESSIONcode on the codeindex.phpcode file and the values are all there. However on the overlay it returns NULL. Ive even codeincludeonceloginForm.phpcode right in the middle of index.php and that gave me the values. So theres something Im missing in order to get the values to apply to code.loadcode elements.p  pHeres some codep  pvariables.phpp  precodeadded values to the SESSION global for testing purposes  SESSION[email]  johnjohn.com SESSION[password]  johnny SESSION[name]  John SESSION[surname]  Smith SESSION[country]  UK SESSION[phoneOption]  Mobile SESSION[phone]  987654321 codepre  pheaderlogin.phpp  precodethis form accepts an email to check ifExists and decide whats next the input preLoginEmail assumes the value correctly ltform actionheaderlogin.php namepreLoginForm idpreLoginForm methodpostgt ltdiv idloginpart2gt     lttable idpreLoginTablegt       lttrgt         lttd colspan2gt         ltinput typetext idpreLoginEmail titleEmail nametestemail tabindex1 size10 maxlength60 placeholderEmail value. email . gt         lttdgt       lttrgt       lttrgt         lttdgtlta titleforgotten password hrefheaderlogin.php idpreLoginForgotgtforgot passwordltagtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput typesubmit classbtn1 namepreLoginRegisterButton idpreLoginRegisterButton tabindex1 valueLogin  Register gtlttdgt       lttrgt     lttablegt ltdivgt     echo vardumpSESSIONworks ltformgt codepre  ponClickEvents.jsp  precodethis call retrieves the HTML correctly although the variables dont get assigned to the inputs value  preLoginForm .submitfunction event   event.preventDefault var form   this , term  form.find input[nametestemail] .val, url  form.attr action  verifiedEmail  validateEmailterm  ifverifiedEmail      Put the results in a div     olContainer.load..incloginForm.php     overlayOn  else      .sessionstat.css backgroundcolor A60000    codepre  ploginForm.phpp  precodewhen this form is loaded there are no values in the inputs and vardumpSESSION returns NULL ltform idloginForm nameloginForm methodpost actionbooking.phpgt     some blocks are static and created in plain html     ltinput nameemail typetext classdDown12 idagentuser size20 maxlength20 valueltphp echo email gt gt     others are php variables to make the ifelse statement more readable     countryBlock ltinput nameagentuser typetext classdDown12 idagentuser size20 maxlength20 value. country . gt     echo vardumpSESSION NULL codepre  pI kinda ran out of ways to figure out whats going wrong, and I just started learning about AJAX this week.

Negative 21772 blockquote   pAssume that there are an unlimited number of workers each of which can   complete one task, each of which takes some time. There are also   precedence constraints where one task cannot be completed until   another is. What is the minimum amount of time needed for each task to   be completed while respecting the precedence orderp blockquote  hr  blockquote   pAs an example, lets say you have 3 tasks. p      pThe first task takes 10 units of time to complete, the second takes 5   units of time to complete, and the third takes 6 units of time to   complete.p      pThe constraint is that the 2nd task cannot be started until the 3rd   task is finished.p blockquote  hr  blockquote   pGiven this, you can conclude that the minimum time needed for all the   tasks to be completed while respecting the precedence is 11.p      pThis is because you can do tasks 1 and 3 which take times 10 and 6   respectively simultaneously, and after task 3 is finished, you can   begin on task 2 which takes 5 units of time. Thus, all tasks will   end at time 11.p blockquote  hr  pIt seems like this could be solved with a topological sort, which would give you the order in which to complete tasks in order to satisfy the constraints.p  pFor example, in the problem, after topologically sorting the tasks you would end up withp  precodeTask 1 10 Units of time gt Task 3 6 Units of time gt Task 2 5 Units of time codepre  hr  pHowever, once you obtain this order in which go about the tasks, how do you determine which ones can be done simultaneously and which ones need to be done one after the other Further, how do you compute the minimum time needed for all of them to finishp

Negative 21772 pI am trying to build a text based adventure game from this online tutorial below but am at pulling my hair out stage.

I have entered this command on the shell command line prompt window php htdocstextGamegame.php and previously php htdocstextGamegameworld.xml which is where my files are kept as I didnt understand the following paragraph in the tutorial, where I got stuckp  pBefore we go through that script line by line, first try running it. The commands are north, south, west, and east for directions, look to repeat the description of the current place, and quit to exit the game. Run the game using the CLI SAPI, like thisp  precode Windows copy game.php cphpcli copy gameworld.xml cphpcli cd cphpcli php game.php codepre  p Unix php game.php The extra instructions for Windows are there because you probably do not have the PHP CLI executable in your path, so we copy game.php and gameworld.xml into the same directory as the PHP CLI and run it from there. You should, of course, change cphp to wherever you have PHP installed.p  pIf all has worked well, you should be able to play the game  or at least as much of the game as we have so farp  pIt hasnt, I get the following errorp  precodewarning simplexmlload fileIO warning  failed to load external entity gameworld.xml in CxampphtdocstextGamegame.php on line 2 followed by  Notice Trying to get property of nonobject in CxampphtdocstextGamegame.php on line 10 to 12 and line 17 to 34. codepre  pI have checked my code and it is identical to that on the tutorial except I have changed room names and descriptions.

When the user presses and holds on a thumbnail I want to popup a grid that acts as context menu over the location where the thumbnail is.  I have everything working except the positioning of the grid over the target thumbnail.  In WinForms this is trivial using the TopLeft properties, but those properties or anything similar dont seem to exist in WinRT.p  pI have access to the target Image object via the HoldRoutingEventArgs and I have access to the Grid via XAML since it exists at start but with an opacity of 0.  Ive even saved off the Rect structure belonging to the target Image object to a Rect property in my ViewModel in the hopes of pulling this off with data binding.  I just dont know how to move the Grid to the desired location.  How can I do this  p

Negative 21772 pI just ran myself round in circles, all coming down to having instantiated an app delegate object in a secondary NIB that wasnt the codeNSMainNibFilecode.  Amazing how having two app delegates kicking around means you have separate codemanagedObjectContextscode.p  pHeres a thought bcould I make my application delegate class a singleton And safely instantiate it in more XIBs What would that breakbp  pAlso, there are some mentions on stackoverflow that code[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]code is a singleton but it doesnt appear that codeUIApplicationDelegatecode protocol guarantees that, nor is the superclass codeUIRespondercode a singleton, either.  So could I shoot myself in the foot in this regard on iOS as wellp  p[edit] Looks like you could nil out the delegateClassName in codeUIApplicationMaincode for iOS and have the main NIB load the delegate object, so you could create the App Delegate object pattern seen on OSX, if using a main NIB.p  p[edit2] Screenshot of what MainMenu.xib looks like for a new nondocument application.  The project gets created with this object, app delegate class gets created with a window property.  The issue is getting that nice handy object in other NIBs, and that object being the same as code[NSApp delegate]code img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Qfeh.png altenter image description herep

The codeHTMLStripCharFilterFactorycode filter has a bug that makes it not usable in this scenario see a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSOLR2834 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSOLR2834a.  The bug makes the solrj client not able to handle the response from an analysis request to solr.  It is a bug in all versions of solr 4 as far as I can tell and it doesnt look like it is going to be fixed any time soon.  I also dont actually use the codeHTMLStripCharFilterFactorycode.  It was previously put in place but then never used.  As a result I have a blocking, unused feature in my schema that I want to remove.p  pI have a test environment with a copy of all of the data which I have experimented with.  In my test, I stopped the tomcat server that was running solr, removed that codeltcharFiltergtcode line, and restarted tomcat.  I did not see any negative impact from the change and now solrj is able to properly handle things and I get the results I am expecting.  At this point I feel like I can just make the change to schema.xml and that is all I need to do.p  pHowever, when I read pages like a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgsolrHowToReindex relnofollowhttpwiki.apache.orgsolrHowToReindexa it makes it sound like I would need to reindex because Im changing schema.xml.p  pSo in the end, can anyone verify if I would need to reindex or not  What are the risks, if any, to making this change to schema.xml without reindexingp

Negative 21772 pWhen used in lambda functions the placeholder is generally presented as just syntactic sugar that allows you to avoid specifying a parameter, e.g.p  precodedef bars String  s  val o  Somex  o.foreachs gt bars  Explicit parameter. o.foreachbar  No need for explicit parameter. codepre  pThe second foreach is just a shorter version of the first. However if I add in another level of calls then things dont work as one emmightem first assumep  precodedef foos String  s  o.foreachs gt foobars  OK o.foreachfoobar  Error codepre  pWhats happening here is that foo feels its being passed a lambda function rather than a String.p  pSo while it might emseemem obvious to a simple human like me that Scala should transform codefoobarcode to codes gt foobarscode what it actually does is equivalent top  precodeo.foreachfoos gt bars codepre  pFair enough  it was maybe stupid to imagine Scala would magically know, as it were, how far emoutwardem to pull the parameter though in this case one could imagine parsing the initial expression into a tree, seeing the placeholder and then trying to reformulate its immediate parent as a lambda and, on seeing that that doesnt make sense, push the reformulation up and up the tree until it does, but I guess it might just be too hard to reason about expressions in general if one had this kind of implicit behavior.p  pI can avoid using an explicit parameter and reformulate the error case above like sop  precodeo.foreachfoo .composebar codepre  pThis is fairly clear.p  pBut can someone provide a concise explanation of how to think about the placeholder in these situation and the transformations Scala is performingp  pWhile it now seems obvious to me that Scala couldnt deduce that in my error case I meant codes gt foobarscode its unclear to me what rules it must be using.p  pGiven the nice theory behind most things in Scala I hardly imagine there are just some arbitrary rules like if the placeholder is used as an argument to a function replace this by a lambda that invokes this function on its argument.p  pNote I know that in the above examples that I dont even need to use the placeholder explicitly, i.e. I can write codeo.foreachbarcode or codeo.foreachfoo .composebarcode and yes  the original title is a naive formulation of this question  as often the process of asking the question made things clearer to me.p

Negative 21772 pI have a slice that contains different variable types.  Some strings, integers, etc.  Is there any way for me to cast a pointer to one of these values from codeinterfacecode to codestringcode or codeint32code where appropriate.p  pHere is a toy program that demonstrates the issue a hrefhttpplay.golang.orgpJ3zgrYyXPq relnofollowhttpplay.golang.orgpJ3zgrYyXPqap  precode Store a string in the slice valSlice  make[]interface, 1 var strVal string  test valSlice[0]  strVal   Create a pointer to that string ptrToStr  ampvalSlice[0]   Outputs string vs interface  fmt.PrintfT vs Tn, valSlice[0], ptrToStr    Attempt 1 doesnt compile    How can I cast the pointer type to string, referencing the same  memory location as strVal  This doesnt compile var castPtr string  ampvalSlice[0].string   Attempt 2 after assertion, doesnt point to the same memory location var sureType string  valSlice[0].string var castPtr string  ampsureType castPtr  UPDATED fmt.PrintlnvalSlice[0]  Outputs test, not UPDATED codepre  pIf I need to justify my desire to do this, heres the explanation.  The codedatabasesqlcode package looks at the pointer type when scanning values.  My code has already prepared a slice holding zerovalued variables of the correct types to match the resultset.p  pBecause codeScancode requires pointers, I iterate over my slice and build a new slice of pointers to the variables in my original slice.  I then pass this slice of pointers into the codeScancode.  But because the act of creating a pointer as above results in an codeinterfacecode pointer instead of one that matches the variable type, the codeScancode does not know the underlying datatype to convert the raw code[]bytecode value to.p

Negative 21772 pIm looking at moving away from using ClickOnce to deploy my .net app.  Presently I am using InnoSetup as a wrapper so I can distribute a single executable to users.  This has worked fine for our first release  ClickOnce handles the File Associations and ensuring that the correct .net framework is installed  which is nice.  p  pHowever now we are looking at releasing an update and found that our new version installs alongside the old and the old version retains the file associations.  If the old version is uninstalled first then everything works fine, however, at present this process is a manual one user has to go into Control Panel and uninstall it.  I already have a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26028487howdoigetclickoncetouninstalloldversionduringinstallofnewversionherea relating to this problem but since no answers have been forthcoming, Im looking to see if I get InnoSetup to handle everything including the uninstall.  p  pIve already found examples that should help me replicate the .net framework check and install with InnoSetup.

Negative 21772 pIm trying to get dependencies set up correctly in my Workflow application.  It seems the best way to do this is using the Service Locator pattern that is provided by Workflows WorkflowExtensions.p  pMy workflow uses two repositories IAssetRepository and ISenderRepository.  Both have implementations using Entity Framework EFAssetRepository, and EFSenderRepository, but Id like both to use the same DbContext.p  pIm having trouble getting both to use the same DbContext.  Im used to using IoC for dependency injection, so I thought Id have to inject the DbContext into the EF repositories via their constructor, but this seems like it would be mixing the service locator and IoC pattern, and I couldnt find an easy way to achieve it, so I dont think this is the way forward.p  pI guess I need to chain the service locator calls  So that the constructor of my EF repositories do something like thisp  precodepublic class EFAssetRepository      private MyEntities entities      public EFAssetRepository              this.entities  ActivityContext.GetExtensionltMyEntitiesgt       codepre  pObviously the above wont work because the reference to ActivityContext is made up.p  pHow can I achieve some form of dependency chain using the service locator pattern provided for WFp  pThanks, Nickp  hr  h2EDITh2  pIve posted a workaround for my issue below, but Im still not happy with it.  I want the code activity to be able to call metadata.Requirelt, because it should be ignorant of how extensions are loaded, it should just expect that they are.  As it is, my metadata.Requirelt call will stop the workflow because the extension emappearsem to not be loaded.p

Negative 21772 pI am creating an embedded client in java that has to run without user interaction, but root privileges in Ubuntu is giving me problems. My problem is that I have to save files to usrlib and be able to install things like Chromium on the device remotely. These things require root access, but to give root access to my program, the only working solution I have found, is giving the whole JVM root access through sudo visudo and setting NOPASSWD on the JVM, as the JVM is the one running the .jar. So I would like to know if there is any way to give root access to a single Java program, instead of the whole JVM.p

Negative 21772 pwe are trying to create a deep link from our website to app. If the app is not installed then user should be taken to the play store and after installing the app he should proceed to location of the deep link.p  pKey to this is sending referrer query parameter to store marketdetailsidpackageampreferrerencodedDeeplink and then process INSTALLREFERRER in the app. This solution wasnt problem some time ago, but since chrome 25 this kind of auto deep linking doesnt work.

Negative 21772 pI have a string that a user will type in representing time.  i.e 1005p  pIve been searching for a while, and cannot find a way to search this string to find a specific number.  The reason I need this number is because I need to take each number and use an algorithm to discover how much power it takes to display this number on a digital clock.  To do so, I need the frequency of each number.  For example if the time was 1005, the number 0 would occur 2 times, and I can take that 2 and multiply it by the necessary numbers to discover the power needed.p
Negative 21772 pIve been struggling with this issue for quite some time now. Im developing an AngularJS application consisting of two views, each containing a threejs scene with several objects in it. If I directly navigate to the first or the second view coming from a blank browser tab everything works alright, but navigating between the two views is impossible despite my efforts do deallocate programsgeometriestextures on the coderouteChangeStartcode or codelocationChangeStartcode events, something leaks behind and the second view renders nothing on real app with much more complex scenes pc almost freezes and CPU skyrockets. Javascript console in chrome simply logs a second call to codeTHREE.WebGLRenderer 69code but nothing shows up in the canvas. Example online a hrefhttpangularglexaxedre.rhcloud.com relnofollowherea Ive simplified the scene with only a rotating green cube in view 1 and a rotating yellow cube in view 2 click View 2 in top right corner to see what Im talking about. So, instead of tackling threejs memory leak issues, since I am due to deliver this app quite soon, I decided to try a quicker solution have AngularJS fully reload the page on route change, as if I were navigating to that route from a completely different site. SO is full of question regarding how to NOT do a full page reload on route change, so basically I am asking how to achieve the opposite behavior. Cheers.p

Negative 21772 pIm writing an application using PyQt4 to analyze data as it acquired from our data acquisition software. The application will consist of a few widgets p  ul lia widget to display what files have been imported and what data channels are in those files this widget will also contain the file watcher that is looking for data files as they are generatedli lia widget that will plot certain data channels as they are importedli limultiple other widgets that perform different analysis and display the results of that analysisli ul  pAll of these widgets would be contained within a QMainWindowp  pSo basically, the main routine will be file generated external to application  file imported into pandas dataframe  data plotted  analyzed p  pWhat Im unclear about is where in the application would be the best place to actually run the import function and therefore where the actual pandas dataframes will be held. p  pThe two places that make sense to me are either in the first widget mentioned that one that is doing the file watching  displaying of what has been imported or the actual QMainWindow itself. p  pI understand how to tell all the widgets currently in the QMainWindow that a file has been imported using signals  slots. So, for example, the file watcher widget will emit a signal every time a file is imported. This would be connected to slots in the other widgets that would tell them to update the current plot, or run some analysis, or whatever. p  pBut the point of uncertainty Im running in to how to make the data that is imported available to all of the widgets currently in the QMainWindow. Which is what I mean by asking where the import function should actually be run. p  pHopefully what Im asking is clear if not let me know. p  pEdit p  pReading a bit more about MVC design in Qt, its unclear to me whether its appropriate here. I would like to make the parts of the application as independent as possible, so the idea behind using MVC is very appealing, but Im having trouble understanding how it would be implemented in my case. All of the examples that I have been able to find seem to deal with updating, for example, a TreeWidget and a ComboBox so that when the data for one is edited it remains in sync with the data for the other i.e. they both change since the data is held in one place. p  pIn my case the data itself is never modified by anything after it has been imported. Analysis may be run on it, but that would be independent to each widget and would have no effect on the actual raw data that has been imported into the application. Each widget is essentially independent, with anything occurring within that widget having no effect on any other widget in the application. Every widget currently active in the main application simply needs to have access to the data that has been imported, and needs to know when a new piece of data has been added this is envisioned as a dictionary of file names matched to pandas dataframesp  pAs suggested, keeps the data in the main application and connecting to each of the widgets to indicate that a new piece of data is now available is straightforward, so I get how that would work. p  pIm just very unclear about what I would gain by going to MVC route. p

Negative 21772 pI have Python 3 and I am trying to post to Tumblr via API a hrefhttpswww.tumblr.comdocsenapiv2 relnofollowlink to API documentationa. I keep getting an error 401 despite feeling like I am doing everything correctly. There is an official API client in Python 2 but that feels a bit hard to follow and all other mentions of it seem to be in PHP or Java. I also am not sure of the format to post in after the 401 error because the documentation doesnt give any explicit examples other than post.

Negative 21772 pI am creating a C VSTO addin and am having trouble with setting the owner window parameter in Form.ShowDialog when the form is shown in a secondary thread and the owner window is on the main thread.p  pWhen using VSTO, Excel only supports changes to the Excel object model on the main thread it can be done on a separate thread but is dangerous and will throw COM exceptions if Excel is busy. I would like to show a progress form while executing a long operation. To make the progress form fluid, I show the form on a separate thread and update the progress asynchronously from the main thread using Control.BeginInvoke. This all works fine, but I seem to only be able to show the form using Form.ShowDialog with no parameters. If I pass an IWin32Window or NativeWindow as a parameter to ShowDialog, the form freezes up and does not update the progress. This may be because the owner IWin32Window parameter is a Window that exists on the main thread and not the secondary thread that the progress form is displayed on.p  pIs there any trick I can try to pass a IWin32Window to the ShowDialog function when the form is on a separate thread. Technically I dont need to set the forms owner, but rather the forms parent if there is such a difference.p  pId like my dialog to be linked with the Excel Window so that when Excel is minimized or maximized, the dialog will be hidden or shown accordingly.p  pPlease note that I have already tried going the BackgroundWorker route and it was not successful for what I was trying to accomplish.p  pUpdated with sample codep  pBelow is a trimmed down version of what I am trying to do and how I am trying to do it. The MainForm is not actually used in my application, as I am trying to use it to represent the Excel Window in a VSTO application.p  pProgram.csp  precodeusing System using System.Windows.Forms  namespace WindowsFormsApplication1      static class Program              [STAThread]         static void Main                      Application.EnableVisualStyles             Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse             Application.Runnew MainForm                codepre  pMainForm.csp  precodeusing System using System.Windows.Forms using System.Threading  namespace WindowsFormsApplication1      public partial class MainForm  Form              public ManualResetEvent SignalEvent  new ManualResetEventfalse         private ProgressForm progressForm         public volatile bool CancelTask          public MainForm                      InitializeComponent             this.Name  MainForm             var button  new Button             button.Text  Run             button.Click  ButtonClick             button.Dock  DockStyle.Fill             this.Controls.Addbutton                   private void ButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e                      CancelTask  false             ShowProgressFormInNewThread                   internal void ShowProgressFormInNewThread                      var thread  new Threadnew ThreadStartShowProgressForm             thread.Start              The main thread will block here until the signal event is set in the ProgressFormLoad.             this will allow us to do the work load in the main thread required by VSTO projects that access the Excel object model,             SignalEvent.WaitOne             SignalEvent.Reset              ExecuteTask                   private void ExecuteTask                      for int i  1 i lt 100 ampamp CancelTask i                              ReportProgressi                 Thread.Sleep100                                private void ReportProgressint percent                      if CancelTask                 return             progressForm.BeginInvokenew Action gt progressForm.UpdateProgresspercent                   private void ShowProgressForm                      progressForm  new ProgressFormthis             progressForm.StartPosition  FormStartPosition.CenterParent              this works, but I want to pass an owner parameter             progressForm.ShowDialog                             This gives an exception               An unhandled exception of type System.InvalidOperationException occurred in System.Windows.Forms.dll               Additional information Crossthread operation not valid Control MainForm accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.                           var window  new Win32Windowthis             progressForm.ShowDialogwindow                  codepre  pProgressForm.csp  precodeusing System using System.Windows.Forms  namespace WindowsFormsApplication1      public partial class ProgressForm  Form              private ProgressBar progressBar         private Label progressLabel         private MainForm mainForm          public ProgressFormMainForm mainForm                      InitializeComponent             mainForm  mainForm             this.Width  300             this.Height  150             progressBar  new ProgressBar             progressBar.Dock  DockStyle.Top             progressLabel  new Label             progressLabel.Dock  DockStyle.Bottom             this.Controls.AddprogressBar             this.Controls.AddprogressLabel             this.Load  ProgressFormLoad             this.Closed  ProgressFormClose                   public void UpdateProgressint percent                      ifpercent gt 100                 Close              progressBar.Value  percent             progressLabel.Text  percent                     public void ProgressFormLoadobject sender, EventArgs e                      mainForm.SignalEvent.Set                   public void ProgressFormCloseobject sender, EventArgs e                      mainForm.CancelTask  true                 codepre  pWin32Window.csp  precodeusing System using System.Windows.Forms  namespace WindowsFormsApplication1      public class Win32Window  IWin32Window              private readonly IntPtr handle          public Win32WindowIWin32Window window                      handle  window.Handle                   IntPtr IWin32Window.Handle                      get  return handle                 codepre

Im trying to get all of the local IP address of these machines not just the current machine i.e. 192.168.0.1 without having to physically connect to every possible IP and test a connection.p  pSo far everything Ive tried has failed.  Either I can only get the IP address of the machine Im running on or, I get the ip address for Searchguide 198.105.244.65 which is where my ISP defaults when an IP address cant be found.p  pHeres the code Im using that fails.  If I leave the  in the network name, I get an unknown result. If I remove the  I get the Searchguide IPp  precodefunction GetIPAddressNetworkName String String var Error DWORD HostEntry PHostEnt Data WSAData Address InAddr begin      ErrorWSAStartupMakeWord1, 1, Data      if Error  0 then       begin           HostEntrygethostbynamePansiCharNetworkName           ErrorGetLastError           if Error  0 then            begin                AddressPInAddrHostEntry.haddrlist                ResultinetntoaAddress           end           else            begin                ResultUnknown           end      end      else      begin           ResultError      end      WSACleanup end codepre  pSo, assuming I know nothing about the router these computers are connected to, is it even possible to get a list of local IPs p  pThanksp  pemeditemp  pHeres an image of its outputp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7kmop.jpg altenter image description herep

When I runp  precodeinigetuploadtmpdir codepre  pI get the directory that I specified in my codephp.inicode file. Is there anyway to change what PHP uses for the sys temp dir p  pI keep having random files show up in my codetmpcode directory. These are prefixed by php and then have a series of random numbers and letters. From what I can tell, these are probably being generated by PHP tmpfile or tempnam. httpd is the process that is using them when they are created. They are massive files that fill up my entire codetmpcode partition and take my server down. I cant figure out where they are coming from. I could increase the codetmpcode partition size from 500MB to 2GB but Id rather avoid that if I can.p  pI dont understand where the codesysgettempdircode is pulling codetmpcode from. Everything I search for just tells me to change the uploadtmpdir in .ini but these are two separate things. p

Negative 21772 pIm fairly new to PHP and Ive been teaching myself mostly by editing files on a test site thats a duplicate of our live site. We are wanting to upgrade our WordPress site and all our plugins because its nearly 6 years out of date. The person who made the site put in lots of custom code without making a child theme, so I duplicated the live site and upgraded everything. Now, there are a few tweaks I need to make in order to keep the functionality we had before. All of those changes are done except for this last PHP file.p  pIve scoured the file a dozen times by now but I havent been able to find an open bracket anywhere. I tried testing by deleting several sections and using the PSPad function to find a matching bracket, but I continue to get the same error. One of my concerns is that the file uses if statements with  sometimes, but other times it uses .

Ideally, I would want to offset the content so the tapped codetableCellcode is just above the keyboard. The problem is that I dont know how to do it.

Negative 21772 pIm having some difficulty with this question because I have a lot of background knowledge with regards to what needs to be done and my practical knowledge for how to implement it is spotty. I feel like I can almost answer my own question but there are random pieces of information missing which lead me to seek out help.p  h2What I want to doh2  pIm planning to start up a web application development business catered towards small businesses real estate, car sales, etc. From the outset I wish to use the best practices for developing and maintaining codep  ul liLocal development environmentli liRemote testing, staging, and production environments all separate machinesli liBest security practices bare minimum software running on the production and staging servers to minimize the risk of security holes, keep everything up to date, proper UNIX permissions configuration, etcli liAbility to utilize whatever tool is right for a given client MySQL vs MongoDB vs something else... or Apache vs nginx... or local storage vs S3li liFull version control on all codeli liAutoscaling to handle increased server load plus load balancingli liProper logging and analytics... on nearly everythingli ul  h2The scope of this questionh2  pI am not looking for best practices for any particular software item. I am not looking for help working with a particular API. Instead I want to know about the sysadmin process. In what order do you need to set things up or install things to be sure that everything works as intendedp  h2What needs to be doneh2  ol liSpinning up serversli ol  pFirst is the matter of spinning up servers.p  pI plan to use a third party server management solution like AmazonAWS or DigitalOcean. This way I have access to APIs for spinning up a server. However in order to utilize these APIs I must access them from strongsomewherestrong, so it seems logical to me that I should have one central control panel server which never gets spun down and houses no development code, then I log into here to monitor the health of my servers, spin up servers, and spin down servers. Is this accurate, or is there a better solutionp  pI also know that in order to manage testing, staging, and production servers for several clients and possibly multiple production servers if a client grows large enough I will need a configuration management tool like Chef or Salt. If I used such a tool, would my control center act as the master and all of the servers I spin up act as slaves Or should I have a second, separate server to act as my chef masterp  pFinally, when it comes to configuration management tools, how do I get them installed on the slaves Should I create a custom snapshot on AmazonAWS  DigitalOcean so that when I spin up a server its automatically installed, or will this run into issues if Chef is updated and my snapshot is not Should I SSH into a new server after spinning it up and install it manually using aptgetp  ol start2 liConfiguring the softwareli ol  pSo lets say I successfully spin up 3 servers testing, staging, and production. In staging and production I want install the latest Apache, MySQL, and PHP according to the best security and performance practices. Or maybe I want to install NGINX, MongoDB, and Node.js.p  pAs the software chosen may differ per client, I need some way to specify what will be installed. Its my understanding that this is trivially done through almost any configuration management tool. I also need a good way to add or update software in the future. Also should be trivial, however it would benefit me to have the actual process explained emHow do I upgrade MySQL on the production server without taking it down for an houremp  pThe real question now is how to properly configure it. Best practices for individual elements of software are beyond the scope of this question, as Im only interested in the process for being a sysadmin. I can look up the best way to install MySQL on my own time. However whats the best practice for doing it via configuration management Do I just update a single config file and every server is updated, or do I update staging then somehow perform a switch to production independent of Chefp  pThe whole switch from staging to production has always seemed like magic to me. How can you upgrade the software in production without at least a few seconds of downtimep  pAlso when it comes to the testing server, should automated testing tools be managed by Chef or should the testing server be managed manually like the local development environment might bep  ol start3 liSetting up version controlli ol  pI plan to use Git. Theres no debating this  I like it, and Ive used it in my job for two years now so Im familiar with it. However a major question remainsp  pHow do I get the code into testing  staging  productionp  pI need to have at the very least two repositories My local one for development and a remote one for tracking and collaboration. However in test I dont really need to clone the entire repository including all deltas. All I really need is the most uptodate files on the master branch.p  pIs it better to automate this process when something is pushed to the remote master it automatically shows up in test or should there be some way to push code into test so that a rogue developer cant screw up the test process by pushing new code in the middle of a test cycle Is this something that is managed by Chef, or something that I have to handle myselfp  ol start4 liSetting up the staging environmentli ol  pThis is really just a continuation of the question from 2. So I use Chef  Salt  Puppet  Whatever to ensure that staging and production have the same software installed, with the same versions, with the same configuration. Staging can clone the production database to be sure that theres no differences between the two environments. Then I somehow question 3 transfer my new code to staging to verify one last time that nothing breaks. Now Im ready to go to production...p  pHow do I do it How do I flip the switch to go from staging to production with absolutely zero downtime Using Chef doesnt seem ideal since it will have to copy over my new code meaning at least a few seconds downtime. Plus if there was an update to Apache  NGINX and I was testing out this update in staging, it could take the site down for several MINUTES while it installs the update.p  pSo how to do thisp

Negative 21772 pIt is easy to use SFINAE to hide a particular function overload if a particular expression is not wellformed. But I want to do the opposite, hiding an overload if and only if a given expression emisem wellformed, and to do so in a very general way. I have a solution thats working in clang 3.5.0 and gcc 5.2.0, but Im interested in any comments and alternatives.p  pIdeally, there would be a builtin codeconstexpr boolcode functionmacro that would tell us at compile time whether a particular expression is well formed.p  precodeISWELLFORMED  declvalltTgt lt declvalltTgt     I want this as bool codepre  pwhich could be used with codeenableifcode to enable or disable overloads.p  pI have found a solution, but I have come across some strange behaviour in g 5.2.0 and clang 3.5.0 and I wonder if either are buggy.p  hr  h2A proposed solutionh2  pFirst, the most robust solution Ive found so far, which works on both compilers. For example, I want to test if codeTcode has a code.lengthcode method. This requires hiding the expression inside another template. Also, a function called codewellformeddefaultcode that Ill discuss later.p  precode     Define a template to contain our expression     templatelttypename T2T, typename           decltype declvalltT2gt.length   This line is the expression to test     gt struct testforlengthmethod   codepre  pand here is how it might be used in a containing classp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt struct Demo   the main struct Im working on       Define a template to hide our expression     templatelttypename T2T, typename           decltype declvalltT2gt.length   This line is the expression to test     gt struct testforlengthmethod         test if the above test succeeds     constexpr bool Thaslength          wellformeddefaultlt testforlengthmethod gt       demonstrate the bool in an enableif     templateltbool b  Thaslengthgt     static     auto demoenableif gt typename stdenableiflt  b gttype           cout ltlt T has length ltlt endl          templateltbool b  Thaslengthgt     static     auto demoenableif gt typename stdenableiflt b gttype          cout ltlt T doesnt ltlt endl       codepre  pThe above works as expected with codeDemoltintgtdemoenableifcode and codeDemoltstdstringgtdemoenableifcode.p  pI cant use codeThaslengthcode directly inside the codeenableifcode as it will lead to hard errors because its not template substitution. Therefore, I pretend it is a template parameter by making a copy of if in another template parameter codebool b  Thaslengthcode. This is similar to how we have to use codetypename T2Tcode inside the test struct. A bit annoying, but I guess it makes sense.p  pI now define codewellformeddefaultcode. It takes a template and optionally some types and returns true or false depending on whether it can construct the template with those particular args. I would include it automatically in all my projects. Perhaps something like this already exists in the standardp  precodetemplatelttemplateltclass...gt class Template, class ...Argsgt constexpr auto wellformeddefaultimplint      gt typename stdconditionalltfalse,TemplateltArgs...gt, boolgttype          return true  templatelttemplateltclass...gt class Template, class ...Argsgt constexpr auto wellformeddefaultimpl...     gt bool          return false      templatelttemplateltclass...gt class Template, class ...Argsgt constexpr bool wellformeddefault      return wellformeddefaultimplltTemplate,Args...gt0  codepre  pp  h2My first questionh2  pThis works in both g 5.2.0 and clang 3.5.0.

I thought it would be equivalent. But instead, with both compilers, they think that codestringcode does emnotem have a length method.p  precodetemplatelttypename T2Tgt     using testforlengthmethodalias  decltype declvalltT2gt.length  codepre  pFinally, I tried both the struct and the alias, but where I explicitly define the first type parameter codeTcode instead of relying on the the default codeT2Tcode.

Negative 21772 pWhen making requests to the reachestimate endpoint in the Facebook Ads API v2.4, we are receiving an Unsupported get request error code 100 for some users, whereas it works for the majority. Heres what I knowp  ul lipThe requests are wellformed. We are providing the access token, ad account ID, currency, targeting spec, and API version. Except for ad account ID and access token, the parameters are identical between working and nonworking requests.pli lipAccording to the access token debugger, the access tokens are valid, never expire, and contain the adsmanagement scope. pli lipI am able to use the same access token to successfully retrieve the Facebook page being promoted.pli lipOne theory was that perhaps the users did not have permission to view the pages that were being promoted. To test this, I added an alcohol restriction to one of the pages for which the reachestimate call did work, and changed the users age to 20. I also blocked the country in which that user was located. The reachestimate call continued to work for that user, so thus that did not reproduce the issue.pli ul  pFacebook seems to be providing a generic error that does not help determine the problem. Im looking for any other ideas as to what it could be or how to identify it.p

The server already has numpy and spicy, I installed pyyaml and Theano using pip install XXX user. p  pI downloaded HDF5 source and installed it by running the .configure, and it was installed successfully, under folder homemynamesoftwarehdf5. Now the last step is to install strongh5pystrong, where I was stuck in and cant find solutions online. p  pI triedp  blockquote   pHDF5DIRsoftwarehdf5 pip install h5py userp blockquote  pAnd getting the following error p  blockquote   pusrlib64gccx8664suselinux4.7........x8664suselinuxbinld   cannot find lhdf5   usrlib64gccx8664suselinux4.7........x8664suselinuxbinld   cannot find lhdf5hl   collect2 error ld returned 1 exit statusbr   error command gcc failed with exit status 1p blockquote  pThen I tried p  blockquote   pCFLAGSIusrlibopenmpiinclude Ihomemynamesoftwarehdf5include LDFLAGSLhomemynamesoftwarehdf5lib pip install h5py userp blockquote  pBut getting the same error.

Negative 21772 pFor all intents and purposes, MMDrawerController basically acts like a UINavigationController, where it holds a ViewController as the root VC.p  pIs it ok practice to hold the MMDrawerController in a variable in the root VC or should I store a reference to the MMDrawerController in the AppDelegatep  pI dont want to run into any memory issues and the reason I ask is because at some point in a Registrations Controller I have to codepresentViewControllerrootVCcode. This would be a different instance of the root VC and I would either have to store the reference to the MMDrawerController in the Registrations Controller OR maybe call upon the AppDelegate and change the MMDrawerController stored there to the new one for the new Root VCp  pI suppose that second option would work fine, but still curious overall about my question in the title.p  pAlso, one last thing Is there any way when one calls codepresentViewController...code to make the new ViewController the new initial controller As it stands, in the new presented controller I would still be able to codedismissViewControllerAnimated...code which means that the underlying stack of View Controllers are still in memory. Id like them dumped from memory. Should I even be concerned about thatp

Negative 21772 pWhat is the recommended approach for checking for new data regardless if the app is in the foreground or background  I am wondering which Android API people are typically using to do this.  There seems to be a few ways to achieve my goal, and I want to make sure Im on the right path.p  pI have something put together which uses codeAlarmManager.SetInexactRepeatingcode to call an codeIntentServicecode which does the sync and insertsupdates data in the database.  This works while the app is in the foreground and background, but if I force stop the app then I keep seeing Unfortunately,  has stopped working messages when the AlarmManager alarm wouldve triggered.  In this case, I only care about checking for new data only when the app is running in the foreground or background.p  pMy first thought is to detect when the app is force closed, and stop the alarm, but that does not seem possible.  So I am asking here, is my approach wrong  If so, which approach is used to perform some periodic task regardless if the phone is in the foreground or background The problem with the AlarmManager solution I am using is the alarms continue to fire even when the app is closed.p
Negative 21772 pI am currently trying to analyze different strategies for a processing method. There are 4 quantities of 2 options 24 and 1 quantity of 4 options 4 for a total of 64 different rows of the dataframe. For example, the data frame would be structured as followsp  precodeOverallName  option1  option2  option3   option 4  option5  value codepre  pWhere each object is a 3 character string corresponding to the option.p  pI would like to be able to compare based on an option, so for example, if Im testing to compare option1, I would like the other 4 options to form the x axis something like option2.option3.option4.option5 and the y axis be the value, thereby, the strategies that differ only in the option1 would appear at the same x position, but presumably different y position and then compare both choices with some statistical metric that I havent decided upon yet, but thats a bit farther down the line. p  pSo, for example, if I hadp  precodeOverallName               option1  option2  option3   option 4  option5  value data.aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa    aaa       aaa       aaa        aaa        aaa       .93 data.bbb.aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa    bbb       aaa       aaa        aaa        aaa       .85 codepre  pI would want the aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa position of the x axis to have one point colored a to show .93, and the other colored b to show .85. p  pSimplified example codep  precode  dataset lt data.framematrixncol5, nrow0   namesdataset lt cname, opt1,opt2,opt3, mnr   name lt name1   opt1 lt aaa   opt2 lt aaa   opt3 lt aaa   val lt .95   dataset lt rbinddataset, data.framename, opt1, opt2, opt3, val   name lt name1   opt1 lt bbb   opt2 lt aaa   opt3 lt aaa   val lt .85   dataset lt rbinddataset, data.framename, opt1, opt2, opt3, val   name lt name1   opt1 lt aaa   opt2 lt bbb   opt3 lt aaa   val lt .97   dataset lt rbinddataset, data.framename, opt1, opt2, opt3, val   name lt name1   opt1 lt bbb   opt2 lt bbb   opt3 lt aaa   val lt .87   dataset lt rbinddataset, data.framename, opt1, opt2, opt3, val codepre  pthen some command would produce two lines, both from aaa.aaa to bbb.aaa, one with values [.95, .97] and the other with values [.85, .87], and the first line would be called aaa and the second bbb. p
Negative 21772 pIm creating a web site using ASP. NET with a large client side that takes care of many events for the site. On the client side via AJAX I update, delete and add to the database in that order. My question is, because the order of the tasks is very important first update database, second delete from database, third add to database  Should I make the AJAX call synchronous by changing async to false or should I leave it as true by default which approach should I takep
Negative 21772 pI have never used Jmeter or Maven and have been assigned to the task in my work place. I have Jmeter Functional tests which are integrated with maven and when I run it from maven they run fine and produce a result like below However, the approach is okay if all tests are green. If something fails I dont know which test run has failed. Can we do something to improve the reporting of maven from Jmeter. I saw something called jmeteranalysisMavenplugin which I beleive is to analyse performance test results from Jmeter. Any idea or any other plugin you know to report functional tests of Jmeter in a better way. Also one more question. If we have to use this analyze plugin do I need to download the jar file of the plugin. But where to keep it. Is there any guide which explains how to use a new jmeter plugin with maven from scratchp  p[INFO] Tests Run 7, Failures 0 [INFO] Total time 25.714 sp  pThanks in Advance.p  pCheers Vivekp
