Positive 58338 pI have a codeUIImageViewcode subclass in swift set up so I can access touchesBegantouchesMovedtouchesEnded.p  pWhen one of these methods is called, I need to change a property of a different, loaded view.p  pIt seems to me that I will now need to access the active view controller in order to set the properties of this other view. Is there are better way to go about this such as event methods called in the view controllerp  pNote that Im new to iOS and I am not extremely familiar with the event system yet, as most information Ive found is written in Objective C and not in Swift. Dont worry, Im looking through Apples Documentation.p  pAlso, no, I cant change the codeUIImageViewcode to a codeUIButtoncode. Even if I changed to a codeUIButtoncode, I need access to the individual codetouchesBegancode, etc. methods and the same problem would persist.p

Positive 58338 pSo, in my app, I utilize Background Fetch. I also use the Keychain with this for authenticating sessions and requesting data from my backend.p  pIt seems as though Background Fetch is never called when the phone is locked. Is this the casep  pFurther, I was under the impression that when using Keychain, that whenever my app is in the background, Id be able to access values stored there as long as I use code.AccessibleAfterFirstUnlockcode.p  pIm using that, but whenever the phone is locked and I Simulate Background Fetch via Xcode, my values I get back from the Keychain are codenilcode.p  pIs this expected I havent found any answers about these situations exactly. It seems like when the phone is unlocked that I successfully get values from the Keychain every time.p

Positive 58338 pI have an UITabBarController that has 3 UINavigationController within. What I am trying to do, is on the push of a button on the UINavigationControllers bar, to drop the bar all the way down to right above the UITabBarControllers bar. I am doing this so that I can display in a pull down fashion, more content that would fill in the area above the now lowered UINavigationBar and then go away when it is moved up. So, in essence, I want to move around the UINavigationBar of a UINavigationController. I will only need this slideup down behavior of the UINavigationBar in the root view controllers of the respective UINavigationControllers of each tab. I have tried to just reposition the bar on the UINavigation controller like so...p  precode IBAction func moveBarDownsender AnyObject       self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame  CGRectx 100, y 500, width 100, height 100        note that I just used bogus values for demonstration purposes. codepre  pHowever, I get something like this...p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png altenter image description hereap  pAs you can see, the navigation bar extends all the way to the top even though it only has a height of 100. This leads me to believe that I am not supposed to resize and move around the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController and move it around. So, was thinking and researching some other ways of getting this same functionality. p  p1 Fake it I was thinking that I could just programmatically insert an identical but fake navigation bar not connected to a UINavigationController, hide the real UINavigationBar attached to the navigation controller, and then move the fake one around as needed. Then, on the slide up, I could move fake navigation bar back up, unhide the real one, and then delete the fake navigation bar.p  p2 Implement my own sort of navigation controller I was reading that I could use a container view to implement my own navigation controller. I am not familiar with doing such a thing, and dont even know if implementing my own UINavigationController would be a good thing to do.p  pSo, my question is, how would I achieve the desired functionality of moving the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController Is there some way that I am totally missing Any comments, suggestions, or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Positive 58338 pIve been building a game center game for iOS and it works great so far. I finally started testing the game and theres obviously some latency, which is causing the game to be out of sync.p  pBasically I have 2 players, each controlling a game character. The game character can shoot fireballs and iceballs etc. These attacks do damage, and they have effects. For example. the ice ball effect will freeze the opponent for 3 seconds if it makes contact. the fireball will do extended fire damage for 3 seconds.p  pso the problem is, when I was playing against my brother, because of the latency, my game said I had 40 health left and he was down to 0, while on his device, the game said I had 0 and he had 20.p  pThis means that attacks were registeringcolliding on one device based on the positions of the charactersfireballs and not on the other. and vice versa.p  pIm currently using the default peertopeer gamecenter architecture. Would using a clientserver architecture one person becomes the server solve this outofsync problemp  pif not, what other options do I have with the game kit APIp

Negative 58338 pI am developing a scientific application used to perform physical simulations.  The algorithms used are On3, so for a large set of data it takes a very long time to process.  The application runs a simulation in around 17 minutes, and I have to run around 25,000 simulations.  That is around one year of processing time.p  pThe good news is that the simulations are completely independent from each other, so I can easily change the program to distribute the work among multiple computers.p  pThere are multiple solutions I can see to implement thisp  ul liGet a multicore computer and distribute the work among all the cores.  Not enough for what I need to do.li liWrite an application that connects to multiple processing servers and distribute the load among them. li liGet a cluster of cheap linux computers, and have the program treat everything as a single entity.li ul  pOption number 2 is relatively easy to implement, so I dont look so much for suggestions for how to implement this Can be done just by writing a program that waits on a given port for the parameters, processes the values and returns the result as a serialized file.  That would be a good example of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGridcomputing relnofollow titleGrid ComputingGrid Computinga.p  pHowever, I wonder at the possibilities of the last option, a traditional cluster.  How difficult is to run a Java program in a linux grid  Will all the separate computers be treated as a single computer with multiple cores, making it thus easy to adapt the program  Is there any good pointers to resources that would allow me to get started  Or I am making this overcomplicated and I am better off with option number 2p  pEDIT As extra info,  I am interested on how to implement something like described in this article from Wired Magazine a hrefhttpwww.wired.comtechbizitnews200710ps3supercomputer relnofollowScientific replaced a supercomputer with a Playstation 3 linux clustera.  Definitively number two sounds like the way to go... but the coolness factor.p  pEDIT 2  The calculation is very CPUBound.  Basically there is a lot of operations on large matrixes, such as inverse and multiplication.  I tried to look for better algorithms for these operations but so far Ive found that the operations I need are 0n3 In libraries that are normally available.  The data set is large for such operations, but it is created on the client based on the input parameters.p  hr  pI see now that I had a misunderstanding on how a computer cluster under linux worked.  I had the assumption that it would work in such a way that it would just appear that you had all the processors in all computers available, just as if you had a computer with multiple cores, but that doesnt seem to be the case.  It seems that all these supercomputers work by having nodes that execute tasks distributed by some central entity, and that there is several different libraries and software packages that allow to perform this distribution easily.p  pSo the question really becomes, as there is no such thing as number 3, into  What is the best way to create a clustered java applicationp

Negative 58338 pI have a relatively simple feature that uses the WebClient class to perform  an HTTPS POST to a web server.

Negative 58338 pI have a UIWebView within my application which Im using to provide web browsing functionality.p  pI have a button on my toolbar which callsp  precodevoidstopLoading codepre  pon the UIWebView. The problem with this is that when this method is sent to the web view, the delegate receives the p  precode voidwebViewUIWebView webView didFailLoadWithErrorNSError error codepre  pmessage. The error accompanying this call is strongOperation could not be completed. NSURLErrorDomain error 999.strongp  pI also use the didFailLoad message to tell if the page actually failed to load  and in that case, I display an html formatted message to user to communicate this failure to them.p  pSo the problem is that if the user hits the stop button, the error page is shown instead of just showing whatever parts of the page loaded before being stopped.p  pI had hoped that NSError.h contained an enum of error codes that I could compare against  but it seems like Ill have to make my own based on my observations of the error codes that come out in my logs  which is less than ideal, since they could change in the future...p  pAny suggestions would be great, thanks.p

Negative 58338 pI get a crazy error and I am unable to see why it happens. I have made a simple app that uses a TabBar to navigate 3 views.

Negative 58338 pIve been using mootools for some time and trying jQuery for a week so this probably is a  newbie question  though Ive found nothing in the manuals.p  pIn mootools, when you use the option strongclonestrong in a sortables list it creates a clone of your imageobject that helps you visualize where the imageobject will be droppped  works great on my thumbnail sorting system.p  pa hrefhttpmootools.netdocsmoreDragSortables relnofollowmootools sortables doc pageap  pWell, jQuery also has that same option, strongclonestrong but when I use it doesnt do a thing. Meaning, it in fact clones the element and the one you drag around is a clone but when you dropit the original stays exactly where it previously was.

Negative 58338 pIm using Turbogears 2.1 and repoze.whowhat and am having trouble figuring out how to extend the basic authentication functionality. I am essentially attempting to require users to activate their account via an emailed link before they can login. If they try to login without activating their account, I want to display an appropriate error message. The default Turbogears functionality simply displays one message for all errors. p  pI created my own authentication plugin which works fine. It wont allow users to login if they have not activated their account. However, the problem comes when I try to create the form and display custom error messages. How can I go about doing thisp  pThanksp
Negative 58338 ptemplates allow in c to automatically create a lot of classes with the same interface, but different data stored.p  pim looking for something similar i dont know whether it exists, thats why I ask here that automatically creates for me variations of an object storing only a subset of the datamembers.p  plets say i have ap  precodeclass FullClass  public     bool A     int B     float C     double D  codepre  pthen i would like to have all possible combinations of those fields like for examplep  precodeclass BDClass  public     int B     double D  codepre  porp  precodeclass BCDClass  public     int B     float C     double D  codepre  pand i want to be able to cast from any of the variation classes to FullClass such that the defined fields will be copied, and the missing fields are set to defaultvaluesp  precodeFullClass foo BDClass bar  BDClass3, 5.0 foo  FullClass bar codepre  pIs there any mechanism that lets the compiler create those variations for me, or do I have to define all possible combinations myselfp  pthanksp  peditp  pwhy am I looking for thisp  pI have a software construct that follows the strategy pattern. thus, i have a bunch of different algorithms more than 30 using the same interface. the client shall be able to use this interface without knowing what exact algorithm currently is running behind. the client calculates such a FullClass object and passes it through the interface  however, each algorithm uses only a subset of the fields provided in this object and each algorithm uses different ones.  This strategypattern construct is fixed and i cannot change it.p  pNow i want to record the sequence of such generated FullClass objects, such that the complete flow of the usage of this construct can be repeated without having to recalculate those FullClass objects. However, this is a lot of data which id like to keep in mainmemory for performance reasons and since most of the algorithms only use a small subset of the fields, i only want to store the fields which are effectively usedp

Negative 58338 pI have a multistep Sharepoint workflow in task list A that starts when a new task is created in that list and creates a task in another list, B. When that task in list B is completed, I would like the workflow in list A to create another task in list C. p  pI am using Sharepoint Designer 2007 to build all of this and at the moment I have this represented by multiple steps. So, step one is to create the task in the other list, and store its ID as a variable. Step 2 is conditional on a value in the task created by step one being marked complete, and it creates a task in the next list, and so on.p  pHowever, when I run the workflow, it marks its status as complete as soon as the item in the first list is completed, and does not go on to create the task outlined in Step 2 of the workflow.p  pI would like to know why the workflow is marking itself complete at the end of step one, and why the subsequent steps are not executed. Thanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 58338 pIm implementing a web app, which uses sessions. Im using GWT and app engine as my clientserver, but I dont think theyre doing anything really different than I would do with PHP and apache etc.p  pWhen a user logs into my web app, I am using HttpSession to start a session for them. I get the session id like thisp  precode From my login servlet getThreadLocalRequest.getSessionfalse.getId codepre  pI return the sessionId back to the client, and they store it in a cookie.

What are my options Can I just set no expiration time for this cookie That way the user would have to explicitly log out, otherwise they could just use the app forever without having to log back inp  pOr is there a better way to do this I cant remember sites like Twitter having ever asked me to log back in again. I seem to be permanently logged in. Do they just set no expirationp  pThe webapp isnt protecting any sort of highly sensitive data, so I dont mind leaving a cookie that doesnt expire, but it seems like there must be a better wayp  pThis is the tutorial Im referencingp  pa hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitincubatorwikiLoginSecurityFAQhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitincubatorwikiLoginSecurityFAQap  pThanksp

Negative 58338 pIve got a scenario where we have a customer who has a linux hosted php app joomla that they wish to integrate with some backend asp.net mvc functionality that was created for a sister site. Basically, the mvc site has prices and stock availability methods which in the sister site populates dropdown lists and other order style info on the pages. Ive been tasked with looking at the integration options to allow the php site to use this info as a service. as ever, these guys are looking at cost of ownership, maintenence etc, so this is their preferred route p  pHas anyone done anything similar with success Id imagine much like the sister site liberal doses of ajax will be employed in order to populate portions of the page on demand. So this may have a bearing on any suggestions that you may have. Also, the methods that are being called ultimately end up populating the same database, so there are no issues with correlating the IDs across the different platforms.p  pI dont really want to go down any iframe type route if at all possible, tho reality may dictate this as being an option. Im possibly naively imagining that i could simply invoke the mvc functions directly from the php app with some sort of session variable being passed for authentication.p  ppretty tall order or pretty straightfwdp  pcheersp  pjimp  pstrong[edit]strong  tho highly unlikely to be implemented due to the existing structure of the joomla site, would the use of an openID account help to glue the two sites togetherp  palso, found this little article that may go some way twds what Im thinking of a hrefhttpwww.jeffancel.comarchive2009040570.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.jeffancel.comarchive2009040570.aspxap

Negative 58338 pIm having crashing issues using the Quartz PDF API for iOS. At the moment I am compiling with the SDK 4.0 GM Seed and running on my 3.2 iPad I have tried using the 3.2 SDK with identical results.p  pAll the code I am using is based on the standard Apple Quartz documentation and from various sources around the internets. So I cant image Im doing something drastically different or wrong.p  pThe code runs perfectly in the Simulator all versions, its a Universal app and even while using the Simulate Memory Warning function. Ive used the Leaks tool and there are no leaks that it finds. Build and Analyze also finds nothing. No crash or low memory log is left in my Library.p  pAll this leads me to believe the device is running out of memory. This happens after running through say 50 pdf pages, with about 35 having an image of some sort some full page some icon. It does not crash on any particular page. The pdf I am loading is about 75 pages and 3.5MB.p  pIve perused similar issues on this site and around the internets, and have applied some of the advice in the code below. I now release the pdf document reference on every page turn and I no longer retainrelease a page reference. Ive also simplified the image swapping from using CGImages to just using the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext function. Ive tried various implementations for switching the images, including replacing the pdfImgView completely with a newly allocated temp instance using code[[UIImageView alloc] iniWithImageUIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext]code, using the setter for pdfImgView and releasing the temp. All of the variations pass the Leaks and Analyzer tests, but still exhibit the same crashing behavior.p  pSo, before I move away from PDFs altogether, is there something I should try or something I am missingp  pView controller code that is called in interface handlers to swap pages and on first loadp  precode[self drawPage]   ...animation code...simple CATransition animation...crashes with or without   scrollView is a UIScrollView that is a subview of self.view [scrollView.layer addAnimationtransition forKeynil]  pdfImgView is a UIImageView that is a subview of scrollView pdfImgView.image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext codepre  pdrawPage method used to configure and draw PDF page to the contextp  precode[CFURLRef pdfURL  CFBundleCopyResourceURLCFBundleGetMainBundle, CFSTRBMEinterior.pdf, NULL, NULL pdfRef  CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURLCFURLRefpdfURL  instance variable, not a property CFReleasepdfURL CGPDFPageRef page  CGPDFDocumentGetPagepdfRef, currentPage  CGRect box  CGPDFPageGetBoxRectpage, kCGPDFMediaBox  ...setting scale and imageHeight, both floats...  if UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions  NULL      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionsCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, imageHeight, NO, 0.0  else      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, imageHeight  CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext NSLogpage is d, context is d, pdf doc is d, pdf page is d, currentPage, context, pdfRef, page  all prints properly   ...setting up scrollView for new page, using same instance...

Negative 58338 pIs this a good pattern It has a code smell to me with having  a factory class aware of the IUnityContainer... p  pMy basic need was to resolve an ICalculationRuleProcess at runtime depending on an Id of a class. It could be based on something other than the Id, I am aware of that... basically I have a known set of Ids that I need to deal with because I bootstrapped the records into the database manually and there is no way to edit the records. With each Id I have a related class. I also have a varying number of constructor parameters within each class that implements the ICalculationRuleProcess, so using an IoC container is extremely helpful versus some crazy switch statement and variable constructor aguments using Activator.CreateInstancep  pHere is what I didp  ol liRegistered the IUnityContainer instance within the container itself. I wasnt sure if this was even possible, but it worked.li liRegistered all of the ICalculationRuleProcess classes with a unique identifier within the registration basically just the Id.ToString of each possible DistributionRuleli liCreated a factory to determine the correct ICalculationRuleProcess, and had it use the IoC container to figure out the correct class to load.li liRegistered the factory class ICalculationRuleProcessFactory to the IoC containerli liWherever the ICalculationRuleProcess needed to be used, I had the class take an ICalculationRuleProcessFactory in its constructor and have it call the Create method to figure out which ICalculationRuleProcess to use.li ol  pThe code for the factory is herep  precode  public interface ICalculationRuleProcessFactory        ICalculationRuleProcess Create DistributionRule distributionRule        public class CalculationRuleProcessFactory  ICalculationRuleProcessFactory        private readonly IBatchStatusWriter batchStatusWriter     private readonly IUnityContainer iocContainer      public CalculationRuleProcessFactory       IUnityContainer iocContainer,       IBatchStatusWriter batchStatusWriter             batchStatusWriter  batchStatusWriter       iocContainer  iocContainer           public ICalculationRuleProcess Create DistributionRule distributionRule             batchStatusWriter.WriteBatchStatusMessage          string.Format Applying 0 Rule, distributionRule.Descr          return iocContainer.ResolveltICalculationRuleProcessgt         distributionRule.Id.ToString          codepre

Negative 58338 pThis is going to be fairly hard to explain, so Ive put together a JsFiddle to help demonstrate. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netj5TKr relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netj5TKrap  pIve tried to include everything that I require without complicating it too much. The overall aim is to have a list of codelicodes which can be selected single click, ctrlclick, shiftclick or doubleclicked to be opened. The selected codelicodes can be dragged around so that they can be moved into other folders. The JsFiddle doesnt have the codelicodes being grouped together correctly, but Im not worried about that as it is actually working correctly.p  pThe strongproblem that I havestrong is that in Google Chrome and IE and possibly other browsers  strongnotstrong Firefox you cant drag the codelicodes around using the image within the anchor. Or more specifically, in Chrome it doesnt drag until you release the mouse button. If I remove the image the This one works text link it works. If you drag using the image information below the actual anchor, it works as well.p  pI gather its a problem to do with me wanting to be able to click and select codelicodes without actually opening the links.p  pSorry if this is all a bit confusing. Ill answer any questions that come up.p

Negative 58338 pI have an ecommerce application that uses MySQL, and Id like it to be faster. When a part  is accessed on the website that has been accessed before, the part loads quickly because all the necessary data is already in the INNODB buffer pool. However, if the part  has never been loaded before, that data isnt in the buffer pool yet, so it needs to be read from disk, and that is slow. I set my INNODB buffer pool to be 2GB, and this entire database is only about 350MB, so there is plenty of room to load the entire database in the buffer pool. I can see from the INNODB statistics that only about half the buffer pool is used right now.p  pIve found references to preloading the data, also known as warming up the buffer pool, such as a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20080501quicklypreloadinginnodbtablesinthebufferpoolQuickly preloading Innodb tables in the buffer poola or mysqldump.azundris.comarchives70Innodbcachepreloadingusingblackhole.html. The strategy basically involves forcing a table scan on each table since MySQL doesnt have a native way for preloading the data.p  pI dont want to manually create a script that lists every single table in my database and have to do this. How can I create a script that goes through and does a select for each table automatically, and automatically picks out a nonindexed column so that a table scan is performed Thanks.p
Negative 58338 pIn some code I am fixing up, which makes heavy use of generics and interfaced types, I am getting error p  pre E2134, Type ltvoidgt has no type info.pre  pI believe it is because I am in the middle of a refactor where some deeply nested set of units that all use generics are out of sync, but the error is not happening in a place  where I can make use of the error message to fix the code, because there is nothing wrong with the code, at the location where the error is appearing.p  pHere is the context, mocked up, because I can not post the code, there is too muchp  precode unit GenericThing  ...  interface  ...  type  ...

This is a weird armpit of PascalDelphi in my opinion, where you completely violate Wirths idea of strong typing.   It is about as weakly typed as a void  pointer in C, or the Pointer type in Delphi, but it is rarely used, except for in places like the standard preobjectpascal RTL functions like Move, and so on. In my opinion, untyped parameters in interfaces, used in generics, should either be allowed, or disallowed, but not allowed sometimes, and disallowed other times.p  pThis is a case of a Pascal feature from 1978 mixing badly with an ObjectPascal feature from 2009.p

Negative 58338 pI have to make an iPhone app for a company which has a web based system, and wants to go mobile. Its known in advance that the UI of the screen will change fairly often adding new labels, buttons, etc. Also, many elements on the screen have an strongIfcondition then visible else hiddenstrong type situation. For instance, strongifuser.isMember then showLoginButton else showRegisterButtonstrong All this is a fairly common scenario for companies who want to take their weoffering as a mobileapp.br The challenge now is how to write a flexible UI. If I go the standard UIView type approach and add labels, buttons etc, it becomes static in nature. Further, since a lot of elements for instance, in the above example, loginButton, registerButton, retrievePasswordButton are overlapping since they should be on the exact location on the canvas, the Interface Builder looks cluttered.  p  pOne solution I can see is to use HTML content in UIWebView. Considering HTML browsers were defines with the concept for emFormsem in mind, it makes logical sense. There would be some overhead of doing searchreplace for the values in the locally stored html file call it template now, but guess the flexibility provided will be worthy of it.  p  pI would like to invite proscons for this approach, and any other approaches that may have worked for you in the past for making flexible UIs. p

However, the bar is not being resized correctly. Rather than being the width of the activity, the bar is the width of the message text. This means that if the activity is being expanded by the message, then the bar will fill the whole activity, so it looks correct. However, if the message width is less than the activity width, the bar only displays above the part of the activity with the text. Ive tried every single combination of fillparent and wrapcontent that I can think of, and none of those work.p  pIve also tried using RelativeLayout and placing the bar above the message text, but that also doesnt work. If I use the RelativeLayout approach and set the bar to fillparent, it causes the activity to expand to fill the whole screen width, which is also undesirable. Ideally, I want the text placed, the activity width computed, and the bar resized to that width without affecting it. Is there some way to flag a view to fill the parent view but not to affect its size Thanks.p

Negative 58338 pIm developing a WPF application using the MVVM pattern. Im using MVVM Light library and Im also trying to use a dependency injector Im considering Ninject and Unity.p  pIve read a lot of blog articles and Im quite confused about the proper way of making my classes communicate with each other. In particular, I dont know when to use Dependency Injection and when to rely on the mediator pattern.p  pLets consider an example. I have a ViewModel, lets call it DataViewModel, and the Data class that provides some kind of data. How is it better to communicate between themp  pA. Inject a dependency to DataViewModel with an interface of IData This way Data will not have to rely on Messenger, but it will have to provide an event if the Data changes, and the ViewModel will have to subscribe to it.p  pB. Rely on the mediator pattern implemented in MVVM Light as Messenger and send messages between Model and ViewModel This way it will not be necessary to use Dependency Injection at all, because whole communication will be based on messages.p  pMoreover, should my ViewModels have injected dependencies on other ViewModels, or it would be better just to rely on the Messenger If the first, would it be necessary to define a separate interface for each ViewModel I think that defining an interface for each VM will be an additional work, but maybe it is worth it.p

Negative 58338 pBoth Linux and the GNU userspace glibc seem to have a number of WONTFIX bugs, i.e. bugs which the responsible parties have declared their unwillingness to fix despite clearly violating the requirements of ISO C andor POSIX, but Im unaware of any resource for programmers which lists such bugs and suggestions for working around them.p  pHere are a few that come to mindp  ul liThe Linux UDP codeselectcode bug codeselectcode and related interfaces flag a UDP socket file descriptor ready for reading as soon as a packet has been received, without confirming the checksum. On subsequent coderecvcodecodereadcodeetc., if the checksum was invalid, the call will block. Working around this requires always setting UDP sockets to nonblocking mode and dealing with the codeEWOULDBLOCKcode condition. If I remember correctly, MaraDNS was the first notable project affected by this bug and the first to complain unsuccessfully to have it fixed. strongNotestrong As pointed out by Martin v. Lwis, apparently this bug has since been fixed. Workarounds are probably only necessary if you need to support really outdated versions of Linux.li liThe codeprintfcode family in the GNU C library wrongly treats arguments to codescode as multibyte character strings instead of byte strings when a field precision as in code.3scode is specified, potentially causing truncated output. I know of no workaround except replacing the whole codeprintfcode subsystem or simply not using the codeprintfcode family of functions with nonmultibytecharacter byte strings, but this can be problematic if you want to process legacycodepage strings using codesnprintfcode while in a UTF8 locale.li listrikeWrong codeerrnocode result codes for certain syscalls cant remember which ones right off. Usually these are easy enough to check for if you just read the GNULinux man pages and compare them to the standard.strike I cannot find the references for this and perhaps I am mistaken.

Negative 58338 pI have a data model or an object from a class, and I need to initialize it by reading from an xml file, or create this object from scratch and output it to an xml file. Previously, I simply use string operations from python to read xml file.read  string.find and write xml file.write, without error checking. p  pNow I am thinking to use Sax2 to do this. I know how to do it for the read, but not very clear about write. It looks like the sax2 is used for the case when there is an original xml and you want to output after certain modifications. In my case I want to output my data model to xml, with no original xml at all. I wonder if sax2 is good or suitable for this or I should keep using my old way. What is the better way to inputoutput a class object fromto XML with python The class is very simple just a list collection of a list information, i.e., root  children  grandchildren and small size. p  pThanks for any suggestions. p

Negative 58338 pMy .Net Winforms application creates three OpenGL rendering contexts in my main window, and then allows the user to popup other windows where each window has two more rendering contexts using a splitter. At around the 26th rendering context, things start to go REALLY slow. Instead of taking a few milliseconds to render a frame, the new rendering context takes between 5 and 10 seconds. It still works, just REALLY SLOW And OpenGL does NOT return any errors glGetError.p  pThe other windows work fine. Just the new rendering contexts after a certain number slow down. If I close those windows, everything is fine  until I reopen enough windows to pass the limit. Each rendering context has its own thread, and each one uses a simple shader. The slow down appears to happen when I upload a texture. But the size of the texture has no effect on how many contexts I can create, nor does the size of the OpenGL window.p  pIm running on nVidia cards and see this on different GPUs with different amounts of memory and different driver versions. Whats the deal Is there some limit to how many rendering contexts an application can createp  pDoes anyone else have an application with LOTS of rendering contexts going at the same timep

Negative 58338 pHopefully somebody can point me to something that could help. What Im doing is designing a few things in a HTML document, but Id really like to be able to have blocks of CC not too worried, although I imagine C would be easier code in the design document. The problem I have is formatting the code  as Id ideally like syntax highlighting.p  pI know the above is very possible  many sites that allow code to be entered do this, but what Im wanting is for this to be possibly done in javascript so that everything can be contained nicely in a html file that can just be browsed and edited locally with no hassle for running an albeit probably a simple web server. I dont suppose anybody knows of such a javascript tool that can do thisp  pThanks very much. p  pEdit Remarkable  Ive spent the past 1 12 hours looking for something like this and the next search I make after writing this question gets me a hrefhttpshjs.sourceforge.net relnofollowthisa I shall leave this question open a little to give others a chance to post so that if the above doesnt suit somebody, then perhaps another solution will.p

Negative 58338 pSeveral popular CMSs such as Drupal, Wordpress, etc. have an index.php file that is pretty much empty except for a includerequire statement that includes some other PHP file as in emoneem file containing all of the bootstrap code for the CMS. What is the rationale for this Why not just move all of the bootstrapping code into index.php if it is doing nothing other than including the bootstrapping code anyway p  pIm trying to build a CMS as an example project to improve my PHP skills, and Id like to understand what design considerations led them to do it this way. I understand the benefit of breaking up applications into multiple files, but Ive never heard of making a file that does nothing but include another one. Obviously there is some benefit, since several major CMS projects designed it this way, but I just cant figure out what it is. p  pCan someone explain to me the reasoning for thisp

Negative 58338 pstrongNotestrongp  pemGiven this OP was written about two years ago, rather than ask the same question again, I am wondering if stepbystep instructions exist, so that I can integrate a Noir or other Clojure web application into Apache, whether its Jetty, Tomcat, or something else. Similar instructions exist for Django, and I think I understand that Python is being run in Djangos case as an engine rather than a ring framework, so things are more complicated with Clojure web applications.em p  pstrongEnd Notestrongp  pIm deeply in love with Clojure, and Compojure seems like a neat web framework.p  pBut it all fell apart when I wanted to deploy my application on a regular application server like Tomcat as a WAR. I actually had to write custom Ring handlers for static files and resources that would work on both local Jetty and Tomcat because the stock handlers didnt, and I had to prepend the context root everywhere manually.p  pI am negatively amazed that I had to write all this code to create the simplest web application conceivable that would run on both Jetty and Tomcat. I have only three possible explanations for thisp  ol liNobody uses ClojureCompojure for anything other than local development with Jetty, i.e. in productionli liEverybody deploys ClojureCompojure apps on a dedicated Jetty without context root LIke people do it with Node.js appsli liThere is a really simple way to circumvent the problems I ran into I wasnt aware ofli ol  pWhich of these is in your opinion the case Or is it something elsep  pstrongEditstrongp  pPlease note that creating a war file is a nobrainer with MavenLeiningen and not what I mean. Im wondering that I have to write so much code to make Compojure work with Tomcat, basic stuff like static file serving and context root awareness that emshouldem work out of the box.p

Negative 58338 pI have a WPF textbox on a form to allow input of a URI.p  pI tried to do this using a data converter. The problem is that when the textbox binding updates and the textbox doesnt contain a valid URI, p  ul liThe data converter returns a null li liwhich sets my model property to null li liwhich results in a property changed event firing li liwhich sets the text box value to the empty string, wiping out the users invalid inputli ul  pIm a WPF novice, and Im at a loss to find a simple pattern using a data converter that doesnt result in this behaviour. Im thinking there must be a standard pattern to use, that Id know about if I was an experienced WPF programmer.p  pLooking at the examples included with Prism 4, there seems to be two different approaches used. I dislike them both.p  pThe first approach is to throw an exception when my model property is set null, which is caught and shown as a validation error. The problem is that I want the property to be able to be set to null  each time you open the form, the fields are set to their previous values. If the application has never been ran before, the URI will be set to null  this shouldnt throw an exception. Also, the use of exceptions for validation is ugly.p  pThe second approach is when the property is set to null, set the validation state of the model to include the property invalidity, but dont actually update the property. Which I think is awful. It results in the model being internally inconsistent, claiming that the DCSUri is invalid, but containing the previous valid value of DCSUri.p  pThe approach Im using to avoid these issues  is to have a string DCSUri in my ViewModel, which only updates the Uri typed DCSUri property of my Model if it is a valid URI.

Negative 58338 pOk  for a web SITE that loads over and over again this is an obvious question. One sprite sheet that will probably be cached on the users system and some fancy css backgroundposition trickery, and youre saving yourself a ton of server requests. p  pBut for a web APP, that loads once, and never again. Is a sprite really the way to go. Yes, breaking it up into individual pngs means that many more requests up front, but in the long run, how does this fair p  pIm guessing it depends entirely on the rendering engine and how the memory management works, but it seems like having a 200k sprite sheet duplicated all over the place might be more costly to performance in the long run...p

Negative 58338 pIve just started looking into optimizing my queries through indexes because SQL data is growing large and fast. I looked at how the optimizer is processing my query through the Execution plan in SSMS and noticed that a Sort operator is being used. Ive heard that a Sort operator indicates a bad design in the query since the sort can be made prematurely through an index. So here is an example table and data similar to what Im doing p  precodeIF OBJECTIDdbo.Store IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.[Store] GO  CREATE TABLE dbo.[Store]      [StoreId] int NOT NULL IDENTITY 1, 1,     [ParentStoreId] int NULL,     [Type] int NULL,     [Phone] char10 NULL,     PRIMARY KEY [StoreId]   INSERT INTO dbo.[Store] [ParentStoreId], [Type], [Phone] VALUES 10, 0, 2223334444 INSERT INTO dbo.[Store] [ParentStoreId], [Type], [Phone] VALUES 10, 0, 3334445555 INSERT INTO dbo.[Store] [ParentStoreId], [Type], [Phone] VALUES 10, 1, 0001112222 INSERT INTO dbo.[Store] [ParentStoreId], [Type], [Phone] VALUES 10, 1, 1112223333 GO codepre  pHere is an example queryp  precodeSELECT [Phone] FROM [dbo].[Store] WHERE [ParentStoreId]  10 AND [Type]  0 OR [Type]  1 ORDER BY [Phone] codepre  pI create a non clustered index to help speed up the queryp  precodeCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IXStore ON dbo.[Store][ParentStoreId], [Type], [Phone] codepre  pTo build the IXStore index, I start with the simple predicates p  precode[ParentStoreId]  10 AND [Type]  0 OR [Type]  1 codepre  pThen I add the code[Phone]code column for the ORDER BY and to cover the SELECT outputp  pSo even when the index is built, the optimizer still uses the Sort operator and not the index sort because code[Phone]code is sorted AFTER code[ParentStoreId]code AND code[Type]code. If I remove the code[Type]code column from the index and run the queryp  precodeSELECT [Phone] FROM [dbo].[Store] WHERE [ParentStoreId]  10 AND [Type]  0 OR [Type]  1 ORDER BY [Phone] codepre  pThen of course the Sort operator is not used by the optimizer because code[Phone]code is sorted by code[ParentStoreId]code.p  pSo the question is how can I create an index that will cover the query including the code[Type]code predicate and not have the optimizer use a Sortp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe table Im working with has more than 20 million rowsp

And this is where my error occures, because after swapping the languages the enumerationvaluetranslations unique constraint validates to false.p  pTo debug this i simply tryed to print out the error causing translations before and after i processed the params, sop  precodeEnumeration enumeration  Enumeration.getparams[id]  println before enumeration.enumerationValues.each  enumValue gt     enumValue.enumerationValueTranslations.each  enumValueTr gt         println enumValueTr         ifenumValueTr.validate               print errors...                  swap languages  this are the lines of codes that are actually executed, and cause the   error. The actual processing of params looks different of course...   sets the language of Comedy to English EnumerationValueTranslation.get5.language  Language.get1  sets the language of Komdie to German EnumerationValueTranslation.get6.language  Language.get2   println after enumeration.enumerationValues.each  enumValue gt     enumValue.enumerationValueTranslations.each  enumValueTr gt         println enumValueTr         ifenumValueTr.validate               print errors...                codepre  pwich results top  precodebefore EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Fantasy, language enUS, enumerationValue Fantasy EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Phantasie, language deDE, enumerationValue Fantasy   EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Comedy, language deDE, enumerationValue Comedy EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Komdie, language enUS, enumerationValue Comedy   after EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Fantasy, language enUS, enumerationValue Fantasy EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Phantasie, language deDE, enumerationValue Fantasy  EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Comedy, language enUS, enumerationValue Comedy     validation fails Property [language] of class [Translation] with value [Languagecode enUS] must be unique EnumerationValueTranslationvalue Komdie, language deDE, enumerationValue Comedy     validation fails Property [language] of class [Translation] with value [Languagecode deDE] must be unique codepre  pat this state i havend deleted, or saved or flushed in any way anything  this is just the result after altering the objects. And as you can see, there really is no inconsistency in the actual data and the validation shouldnt fail.p  pMight there be a mistake in the way i change the translations I just fetched them by ID and simply updated the language  i tryed that out in a minimalistic example and it worked there... It also works if i just create a deep copy of all enumerationvalues and enumerationvaluetranslations and store that instead which means that the validation really shouldnt fail, but i think this is really not the way it should be done...p  pAnother strange thing is, that the validation only fails if I iterate through the data. If i dont touch the data at all, no error occures, but the data isnt saved too, meaning that the folowing lines are causing the validations to be evaluated at allp  precodeenumeration.enumerationValues.each  ev gt     ev.enumerationValueTranslations.each  evt gt        codepre  pthats why i strongly believe that there must be some nontrivial problem... please let me know if there is anything else you need to know.p  pthanks for any helpp

For instance, instead of allowing an error to occur, applying the function sqrt to an object of the class real will always return an object of type complex.p  pSo far so good, but now it would be a good idea to have some predefined constants, like pi or the complex i. The simplest way would obviously be to declare them as followsp  precoderealltdoublegt pi  3.14... codepre  pBut then, as a maybe too perfectionist programmer, I realize that this approach has a couple of problemsp  p1  An application which requires a high precision pi, for instance, would not benefit from using realp  p2  An application which is concerned about memory usage would not be able to use this pi, since operating it with an object of type real would yield an object of type real. Alright, explicitly forcing conversions down to real every time an operation occurs is an ugliness I want to avoidp  pThe smartest way I see to solve this, is to design constants which lazily properly evaluate themselves through implicit conversion operatorsp  precodetemplatelttemplatelttypenamegt class Cgt class scalarconstant      public         scalarconstantamp operator  const scalarconstantamp  delete          templatelttypename Tgt         operator CltTgt  const   class pit  public scalarconstantltrealgt, public scalarconstantltcomplexgt      public         templatelttypename Tgt         operator realltTgt  const                      return stdacosstaticcastltTgt1                   templatelttypename Tgt         operator complexltTgt  const                      return stdacosstaticcastltTgt1            const pit pi  pit codepre  pAnd here this concept check is absolutely important, since I wont be overloading every operator for every single constant I decide to provide. This way, I can simply provide a SFINAE enabled overload for the operators and it would be just a matter of inheriting the concept to provide new constants.p  pI can obviously erase the undefined conversion operator on the base class and the problem would be solved, but then it would lose the whole concept idea, which is both to enforce the concept check, by making the program potentially not linkable due to undefined inherited functions, as well as to make it easier for the programer the lazy me to get back to this code a couple of years from now and be able to add another concept compliant class, by just looking at the concept itself and realizing what should be provided.p

Negative 58338 pIm using ASP classic and Id like to submit post data without actually having a form.p  pHeres the scenario. The user fills out a comment box in a form on Page1. The form uses Post to submit the data for Page2. Page2 processes the incoming data and redirects back to Page1 using the Response.Redirect method. If the user has filled out something incorrectly I need to post this data back to Page1 so the user does not lose what he has typed. Page2 is not intended to actually display any HTML at any time. Its merely used as a comment processing page and always redirects no matter what. Is there a better or preferred way of doing thisp  pjQuery has the .post method which allows you to do what Im asking for. However, Im really not sure how Id integrate this with my ASP page. I supposed Id actually have to display an HTML page momentarily and then have jQuery handle the redirect after the page is loaded. This also means that Id have a form with values which jQuery would extract. I think this would probably be an OK workaround but Id prefer a more native solution if one exists.p

Negative 58338 pIm building an Android application that will be like an eBook.  Standard flip through pages, view images, etc.  One of the requirements is that in multiple places you will see a preview of what a page will look like.  Itll be the exact contents of that page, just in a smaller size.p  pI cant for the life of me get this preview working the way I need it to.  I coded an activity which will display either controls to play audio or video depending on some values passed in the extras.  That works fine.  The preview should be this activity, but only in a smaller size, and shown in a separate activity.  Heres what Ive tried to get a smaller version of the activity to showp  pFirst, I stumbled across the poorly documented ActivityGroup object.  I figured I could use this to call the activity, and then get the view and throw it into a parent view somehow.  Heres what that code looked likep  precodepublic class GroupTest extends ActivityGroup    Called when the activity is first created.  Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.grouptest      LocalActivityManager manager  getLocalActivityManager      Intent intent  new Intent     intent.setClassgetBaseContext, ViewElement.class     intent.putExtraElementID, 22     intent.putExtraPackID, 10     Window w  manager.startActivityvideoelement, intent     View v  w.getDecorView       Grab the table and add a view to it.

The activity ViewElement was indeed displaying in the GroupTest activity.  The problem was that whenever I tried to add something else to the table like a label, the ViewElement activity would disappear.  I tinkered with this for a while figuring I was failing to grasp some UI constraint, then realized that the ViewElement activity being displayed had clickable buttons, which isnt what I really want.  I just want to see what that page looks like, not be able to interact with it.p  pSo I tried a different approach.

As far as I can tell calling w.getDecorView doesnt return a view that actually has any height, width, or drawn properties on it.  If I run that code I get the error width and height must be  0  And if I put in values for width and height, nothing shows but a black image.  So I then proceeded to create simple things such as a TextView and draw it to the bitmap to display in my LinearLayout, but could never get it working right either.  Im to the point of just being completely fed up with manipulating UI in Android.p  pSo, has anyone else does something similar with previewing what another activity would look like, and how did you accomplish it  Am I just going down the completely wrong path here  Ive googled all over the place and part of me feels like someone has to have solved this problem before, but Ive lost over a day of work on it and I just cant pour much more time into it right now.p  pThanks for any help.p
Negative 58338 pI am developing an iPhone application which plays the video using codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode. When I switch to backgrounddevice with multitasking support, the video play is paused and when I bring my app to foreground video play is resumed. p  pBut, when I switch to foreground I do not want my video to be resumed. I tried to pause the codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode in the method applicationWillEnterForeground. But, I think they resume implicitely after call to codeapplicationWillEnterForegroundcode. Is there any notification methods that corresponds to   codeapplicationDidEnterForegroundcode OR codeapplicationWillEnterBackgroundcodep  pThanks and Regards, Deepap
Negative 58338 pIve got a basic Activity class, which creates a GLSurfaceView and that is passed a class derived from Renderer in its SetRenderer method.  Now Im aware that OpenGL resources can be lost when the phone or tablet goes to sleep so far, so DirectX 9, and that these resources must be recreated when the phone returns from its sleep state.  p  pAm I right in thinking that all of my other classes, the activity and so on, are restored exactly as they were when it wakes  i.e. I would only have to rebind things like textures, shaders, GL state and so on in the onSurfaceCreated method.  I dont need to recreate the view, or the renderer object.  p  pDoes the onSurfaceCreated method get called when the phone wakes, or just once at startup  Is the GL object I receive in onSurfaceCreated destroyed i.e. is it safe to store it and use it through a sleepwake cyclep

Negative 58338 pI know this is simple, which is why Ive been trying like mad to figure it out myself but Im at the end of my rope.p  pWhen a user clicks a button an action is emsupposedem to do thisp  precode IBActionstartActionidsender  MyClass anInstance  [[MyClass alloc] init] NSLogthe name is, [anInstance name] codepre  pAs you can see, MyClass has the name method, which is thisp  precode NSString name  return [nameInput stringValue] NSLogstringValue  , [nameInput stringValue] codepre  pnameInput is a text field which the user fills with a name, presses the button to call startAction, that method should call name in another class, which should return the string value from the text field and make the logs.p  pWhat is actually happening is that when start is pressed the log says the name isnull. And the second log doesnt even appear. I assume its because the name method isnt getting called. But I dont know why. I should specify that they are in separate classes and I declared the name method like thisp  precode NSStringname codepre  pEDIT After a bit more fooling around I found that when the name method gets called from its own class, the log correctly shows whatever was in the text field. I put an extra log inside the name method, and I can see that it emisem getting called from the other class, but the value its returning is still null which means something is happening after the call that is preventing the class from getting the text field string.p  pEDIT Im not sure if this is important but one of the classes is a subclass of NSObject, the other is a subclass of NSViewController.p  pLet me know if you need any more information.

Negative 58338 pI am trying to use Boosts serialization functionality to serialize a derived class.  My base class doesnt have different data members, so the derived class just has this serialize functionp  precodetemplateltclass Archivegt void serializeArchive amp ar, const unsigned int version      ar amp boostserializationbaseobjectltCargtthis  codepre  pThen the base class has this serialize functionp  precodetemplateltclass Archivegt void serializeArchive amp ar, const unsigned int version      ar amp color     ar amp miles     ar amp model     ar amp doors  codepre  pAdding this to the base class made no differencep  precodeBOOSTSERIALIZATIONASSUMEABSTRACTCar codepre  pThe program compiles just fine.  The main generates some dummy data, prints it to stdout, then saves it with boost serialization.  Then it attempts to read the data from the file and print the results.  It saves the data just fine, and I can open the data files and confirm that the data is in fact present.p  pHowever, when rebuilding the derived class and when also rebuilding an instance of the base class, it fails at the beginning of the serialize function for the base class.  Any thoughts  I think I did everything correctly from the example provided on the boost website.  Thank you in advance.

So I thought it would be good if I made an interface for exporters and importers, then have one class for each type of importerexporter, rightp  pNow the problem is that my two methods dont have the same parameters, so I cant use an Interface very easily.p  pThe first exporter is a an organized exporter, and it exports the frames in a manner that humans can easily follow, no restrictions. It would just take the sprite definition, and a file name with no extension then produce the pair of files.p  pThe second exporter is an optimally packed exporter and would take the same parameters plus a maximum width and height. Right now its not optimal, it doesnt resize the frames and it just picks the next slot that fits. Maybe there are additional options parameters that I have not thought of yet for this method.p  pThe XML is identical for the existing exporters, but the PNG differs. Some time down the road, I might like to have other types of metadata exporters, like JSON.p  pFor the existing exporters, they both follow this patternp  ul liDetermine size of output PNG  strongDifferentstrong for each methodli liMake a Bitmap object with that sizeli liSet up, and start writing to my XML fileli liWrite out a bunch of metadata that doesnt relate to the frames just yetli liIterate through each sequence a little more involved than it seems ul liFor each frame ul liFigure out where the frame will go  strongDifferentstrong for each methodli liWrite information about this frame including spritesheet location amp size from aboveli liDraw the frame to the output bitmap at the location amp size calculated aboveli ulli ulli liSave and close filesli ul  pI can provide a link to the code on request.p  pI added Importer to the question because I will want to add importers to these exporters one dayp  pAny suggestions on how I might pull these exporters out of my Sprite class and how to keep them relatedp

Negative 58338 pI am try to fit an eGARCH model on an expanding basis using the rugarch package.  I have 6 columns of data, and I am trying refit parameters 6000 for each column.  If I run the following code, I get an error in windows on the 2nd column this means I am getting all the way through the first inner loop succesfully.  By using gc within the loop and removing the fitted object I have extended the length of time it takes to hit the memory error.  Also, this process takes a very long time in general and I am wondering if there is anyway to improve it on my end.

Negative 58338 pIve recently inherited a project that uses Spring for Net and nHibernate and I have started to get a recurring error on our Live Servers that require an urgent fix.p  pIm not a Spring or nHibernate expert, Im just starting to figure out what the technologies do, and what the different settings are for i.e  I am a total beginner.p  pI upgraded the site from spring version 1.2 to 1.3 and nHibernate from 1.2 to 2.1 and this error has started to creep in and is now becoming very regular.p  blockquote   pException information       Exception type ConfigurationErrorsException       Exception message Error creating context spring.root Existing context [spring.root]WebApplicationContextxxxxxxxx already registered under name spring.root. p blockquote  pstrongNotes on the error and deploymentstrongp  ul lipWe have 20 web sites in IIS 6 using a different copy of the code, all accessing diff databases, all assigned their own application pool.pli lipThe error seems to occur when a user attempts to access a page that they hadnt been to when they originally accessed the site since the last time the application pool has been restarted.  If we restart the application pool, the issue doesnt occur on that page any more, unless we restart the pool because another page had this issue.pli lipIm not sure if the issue is occurring because we have multiple sites trying to access the same spring context, or if each site has their own spring context. I was under the impression that when a user attempts to access the site, if the site had not been accessed before then the spring would set up the injections for all the objects which is why the first page takes a little time to load after an IIS restart or App Pool restart.pli lipIve been looking through the Spring for Net sample code and the set up is pretty similar in the web.config, dao.xml, web.xml files... pli ul  pWeb.configp  precodeltsectionGroup namespringgt     ltsection namecontext typeSpring.Context.

Negative 58338 pI have an ASP.NET in C web application which consumes data from a web service. It works                 just fine most of the time, but sometimes, usually when requesting larger data sets, it         only returns an Access is denied error.p  pFor instance, if I call the service to return some documents from between a certain date range, with a small enough range it works just fine. If I expand the range too far, however, it returns this error. This leads me to believe its either a size or a time issue.p  pHowever, if I try to return all of the documents it returns the Access is denied error almost instantly, with no waiting.p  pIm pretty certain the problem lies between the service and the app, or even in the configuration of the app.p  pCan anyone help me discover why I am getting this vague Access is denied error Let me know if theres more information I should supply.p  pstrongEditstrong I do control the web service. p  pIve tried calling the service through a little windows form app and Ive never seen any errors.p  pIm calling the web service via some kind of contract client Im not sure of the specifics, but I just have a service reference pointing to the service, and then I am able to declare a client and then use the methods within.p  pI am able to access the service just fine in the browser.p  pAs far as the other questions go, Im not sure yet.

This runtime code MUST not use stack, which means when calling dosomedangerthing the stack must in the same status as when we enter the runtime code, except that the return address set to the runtime code the original value was saved to a jmp target, in order to return to the caller.p  pBecause we are using dynamic machine code, the target platform is fixed to WIN32 on x86 CPU, the x64 CPU is not currently in focus.p  pTo do this we have to process any exceptions. In WIN32 C exception is SEH based, so we have to due with it. The trouble is that we cannot find a way to do this and make it compatible with other code. We have tried a couple of solutions but none of them works, sometimes the userinstalled exception handler was never called, sometimes the outer exception handlers was bypassed and we received an unhandled exception error.p  pUPDATEp  pIt seems to be the case that SEH exception handler chain supports code within the EXE image only. If the exception handler pointed to my generated code it will never been called. What I have to do is to create a static exception handler function stub, and then let it call the generated handler.p

Negative 58338 pIts not really a coding problem, but im after some feedback from the community regarding some issues that Im having, while developing a new Logger implementation.p  h1Backgroundh1  pour ASP.NET Application originally worked with log4net. While log4net is a great logging tool, it does not suit our needs and in some cases it even causes problems for our application by the way the logging is done. We currently are implementing our own logging system that is mimicing some behavior of log4net, but also tailored to suit our needs. Im not here to discuss about the usage of log4net or how to config it.p  h1Systemh1  pCurrently we have a system thats beeing developed. The system has a logger class, which is a Singleton emdesign flaw, I know...em and this class has a collection of strongIReporterstrong objects.p  pEverytime the application calls strongLogger.Instance.Logmessagestrong the logger will direct these messages to every strongIReporterstrong inside the queue, and the reporters have the responsibility of logging the message in their destinationstoragewhatever.p  pCurrently weve chosen that each strongIReporterstrong has a backgroundthread and a message queue to process the messages at their own speed. The danger here is that when the app dies suddenly we could lose some of the messages. p  pAnother approach we had in mind was to have a thread pool on the logger and let these threads run over the queue and then delegate the messages to the reporters.p  pstrongWhat Im concerned about is the performance. We first implemented this using events in the logger, but the threads spawned went haywire fast when accessing  the file. So now with this approach we hope to limit the access to the resourcesstrongp  pWhat Im lookign for is people who had similar situations and how they approached this issue.p

On each page user has an option to sort the hotels based on price, name, userreviews etc. Now the intelligent thing to do will be to only get the first 25 hotels on the first page from the database. When user moves to page 2, make another database query for next 25 hotels and keep the previous results in cache. p  pNow consider this, user is on page 1 and sees 25 hotels sorted by price and now he sorts them based on userratings, in this case, we should keep the hotels we already got in cache and only request for additional hotels.

After placing it on the market, I had a friend show me how he could hack into it and just emchangeem high scores something I did not know was possible.  With v2.0, I am adding GameCenter, so this becomes a much bigger deal as I post these scores to a leader board.  I do not want jail breakers to be able to just change their high scores and have a bunch of trillions on the high score list. Is there a way to keep high scores saved on the device so that jail breakers cant edit them so easily    I really liked the simplicity of NSUserDefaults, so I was wondering if there was a way to make these unseeable to jail breakers, but another save system would be just great.  I save high scores for each individual level on the device and upload total episode scores to Game Center, so I cant just retrieve scores from their servers.p  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 58338 pI am importing records from XML files, and it is chewing up memory. Ive gone through the XML ElementTree that is created and deleted all of the elements and subelements to clear memory, but it still just piles up.p  pI finally found a solution, and wanted to have this in SO for others who may have the same problem in the future. I was scouring the web for answers, when I stumbled upon this a hrefhttptravelingfrontiers.wordpress.com20100626djangomemoryerrorhowtoworkwithlargedatabases relnofollowDjango MemoryError  How to work with large databasesa. My MemoryError is not because of the size of my Queryset, because those arent that big, but I figured Id give it a try anyway. I changed all of my objects.all to objects.all.iterator for any loops over objects. That didnt do much, as I was only looping over about three different sets of objects, none of them huge sets. I reluctantly turned codeDEBUGTruecode to codeDEBUGFalsecode in settings.py and it cut down the memory usage to almost nothing From the Django Docsp  pemIt is also important to remember that when running with DEBUG turned on, Django will remember every SQL query it executes. This is useful when youre debugging, but itll rapidly consume memory on a production server.emp  pThis is not a production server, it is my development server. So, since all of the queries executed are stored, where are they and how can I get them If they are so helpful for debugging, why arent they more readily availablep

Can anyone show me or point me to an algorithm that can control a car like that of GTA2 After 3 days of research all I could come up with was all of these algorithms for using pivot and joints on the wheels and separate wheels and such. Is that the only way to achieve simple car movement like that of GTA2p  pI want to be able to use the algorithm on a rectangle without wheels but still be able to have the car drift. Is that possible  By the way, I am usign Box2D for the 2D game.p  pI know this is more suitable for gamedev but for some reason I cant post questions .p
Negative 58338 pJava integrates nicely with the users desktop OS through JNLP. Not only does my software show up as a desktop icon, but it is listed as an installed program in the control panel Windows 7.  I was also able to get the JNLP file to autoconfigure file association. Now if the user doubleclicks a file saved by my program a pxml file, the program launches.  JNLP makes this excellent desktop integration happen smoothly through the web launch. One issue remains How do I get my program to load the data file that the user doubleclicks  The pxml file is given the same icon as my program, and JNLP created the file association, so windows knows to launch my software when the user tries to open the pxml file.  But how does my program know to OPEN that file when it startsp  pBelow is part of the JNLP file for reference, taken from a hrefhttpwww.proctinator.comdistclientDownload.htm relnofollowProctinator.comap  precodeltjnlp  spec6.0 codebasehttpproctinator.comdist gt   ltinformationgt     lttitlegtThe Proctinatorlttitlegt     ltvendorgtSmart Software Solutions, INC.ltvendorgt     lthomepage hrefhttpproctinator.comgt     ltdescription kindshortgtThe Proctinator exam scheduling softwareltdescriptiongt     lticon kindsplash hrefsplashScreen.jpg gt     lticon kindshortcut hrefbigP.jpg gt     ltofflineallowedgt      ltassociation extensionspxml mimetypeapplicationpxmlgt     ltshortcut onlinefalsegt       ltdesktopgt     ltshortcutgt   ltinformationgt   ltresourcesgt    ltj2se version1.6gt ...  ltresourcesgt ltapplicationdesc mainclassthornworks.proctor.GUIgt codepre  p p

Negative 58338 pIm fairly new to Java and Im trying to create a GUI application with some labels, buttons, and textfields. The program is pretty simple and I just wanted to use a default layout, which is FlowLayout. I managed to place and size everything fine, but the only thing seem to be not working is the alignment. I want to place buttons and textfields with certain alignments, but whenever I set an alignment, it moves the text inside of whatever the object rather than the object itself. For example, I wrote p  precode button.setHorizontalAlignmentJButton.RIGHT codepre  pbut it seems like it aligns the text inside the button instead of the button itself.  Is there any way to align the button itself rather than the text inside of itp  pI know the alignment stuff could be easier with some other type of layout e.g. BoxLayout, but I just want to use the FlowLayout for this one, unless it is impossible to align them using the FlowLayout which I dont think so. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 58338 pMy question is about controller methods possibly included from an outside class that work with instance variables. I frequently use a beforefilter in controllers to set up certain variables, e.g.p  precodeclass DocumentController lt ApplicationController   beforefilter fetchdocument    def action     document.dosomething   end    private    def fetchdocument     document  Document.findparams[id]   end end codepre  pIve been working on a project in which a few controllers will share some functionality, say, document editing.  My first thought was to extract the relevant methods, and get them from applicationcontroller.rb or a separate module.  But then I noticed I was writing code that looks like thisp  precode  def fetchdocument     document  Document.findparams[id]   end    def dosomethingtodocument     document.dosomething   end codepre  pThis sets off warning bells dosomethingtodocument is essentially assuming the existence of document, rather than taking it as an argument.  Is this, in your sage opinions, a bad coding practice  Or am I being paranoid  p  pAssuming it is an issue, I see two general approaches to deal with itp  ol lipCheck for the instance var and bail unless its setp  precodedef dosomethingtodocument   raise no doc unless document   [...] end codepreli lipCall the action with the instance var as an argumentp  precodedef dosomethingtodocumentdocument   [...] end codepreli ol  p2 looks better, because it hides the context of the calling object.  But dosomethingtodoc will only be called by controllers that have already set up document, and taking document as a method argument incurs the overhead of object creation.  Right 1 seems hackish, but should cover all of the cases.p  pIm inclined to go with 1 assuming Im right about the performance issue, even though seeing a list of methods referencing mysterious instance vars gives me hives.  Thoughts  Let me know if I can be more clear.  And of course, if this is answered somewhere I didnt see it, just point me in the right direction...p  pThanks, Erikp

Negative 58338 pThere are several tools out there that can decompile an APK dex file and insert various hooks.p  pFor example if you want to check the installer package name you need to call the function codePackageManager.getInstallerNamecode.p  pNow as far as I am concerned they replace the reflection to the method and then either calling the real method or sending some spoofed result.p  pThis has the huge advantage that it doesnt matter if you are calling the method natively or with a reflection.p  pIn this particular case, codegetInstallerNamecode would always return codecom.google.android.feedbackcode.p  pSome source code for such a hook can be found here a hrefhttpandroidcracking.blogspot.de201103originalsmalihookjavasource.html relnofollowhttpandroidcracking.blogspot.de201103originalsmalihookjavasource.htmlap  pIs there a way to detect these hooksp

Negative 58338 pIm new to Java FileUpload APIs of Apache, and for a start, I found a a hrefhttpwww.servletworld.comservlettutorialsservletfileuploadexample.html relnofollowtutoriala that explains how FileUpload can be used in a Servlet.

Following is my project directory structure.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKAT79.png altProject Directory Structurep  pWhile the code of codeUploadImage.javacode is same as mentioned in the example, except that I have the servlet file in codeservletscode package and file MIME type is JPEG image instead of plain text. Now, Im new to servlet development in Eclipse, but as per my understanding, the class file created from the servlet must be kept within codeWEBINFclassescode folder, and its entries in the codeweb.xmlcode. Also, the index.jsp code is same as mentioned in the example of given tutorial. Now, I have codeltform actionservlets.UploadImage enctypemultipartformdata methodpostgtcode in my codeindex.jspcode.

Negative 58338 pSo ive inherited a web application that is using crystal reports to display our reports.

It is only taking 12 seconds to run the stored procedure in the database and at most 45 seconds to get the results of our data in our web services. But when i go to run the report using crystal it takes several minutes.p  pWhat i would like to know is if there is some kind of bug occurring in the crystal reports viewer or if someone would have any idea on how to go about speeding up the time it takes to load a report using the crystal reports viewerp  pIve looked around quite extensively for the answer to this problem which included making changes to the a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comforumsenUSvscrystalreportsthreadf70cad38dea94c4ba8129b2f2a7b4c08 relnofollow.net frameworka But i was hoping for some insight regarding crystal reports itself as to why this occurs.p  pany help of suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 58338 pSo I need to map a texture to a sphere from within a pixelfragment shader in Cg.p  pWhat I have as input in every pass are the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z for the point on the sphere where I want the texture to be sampled. I then transform those coordinates into Spherical coordinates and use the angles Phi and Theta as U and V coordinates, respectively, like thisp  precodeu  atan2y, z v  acosxsqrtxx  yy  zz codepre  pI know that this simple mapping will produce seams at the poles of the sphere but at the moment, my problem is that the texture repeats several times across the sphere. What I want and need is that the whole texture gets wrapped around the sphere exactly once.p  pIve fiddled with the shader and searched around for hours but I cant find a solution. I think I need to apply some sort of scaling somewhere but where Or maybe Im totally on the wrong track, Im very new to Cg and shader programming in general... Thanks for any helpp

Negative 58338 pI am trying to create a script purely learning purposes to translate a given word with a few different dictionaries. I worked my way through two, using urllib2 and beautifulsoup to get and parse the translations, then moved on to google translate.p  pI quickly found it returns  403 forbidden error. Adding a user agent gets the translation, but only a one word translation. To illustrate, go to a hrefhttptranslate.google.comtexttestampslenamptles relnofollowhttptranslate.google.comtexttestampslenamptlesa and you will get both the translation in a class titled hps and a list of verbs, nouns and adjectives.

Negative 58338 pWe are developing a completely new mobile version of our site, it is a HTML5 site written using Sencha Touch 2 Ext JS, JavaScript.p  pWe are using Google Analytics on our main site, and we would like to use GA on the mobile site as well. However our desired use case is a little special  strongWe would like hits to articles on the mobile site to be tracked as hits to the corresponding article on the main site.strong The reasoning behind this is the desire to aggregate the statistics, and not have the data tracked separately.p  pThe domains and URL structure is different for the two sites, although the site hierarchy is somewhat similar they both get content from a Sharepoint backend, and herein lies the challenge. We cannot only change the domain using something like setDomainName.p  pOn every page in the mobile version, we have available the full URL to the original pagearticle on the main site.

Could we provide this method with the desired hit URL and thats it Would it work then to have a script in the header that checks for a set variable with this URL, and if it exists call trackPageView with it as a parameter, if not just track a regular hit Any help with syntax for this approach is welcome.p  pAll help amp suggestions appreciated here Ive scoured GA docs without much helping information on this special case.p

Negative 58338 pI find myself doing a lot of work here and there both for myself and on contract to develop small, static websites where the use of dynamic tools like PHP frameworks or Rails would be totally useless and heavyhanded and a waste of resources.p  pIm looking for a way to author static HTML sites that introduces a level of modularity and syntax simplification to clarify, something like SASS for HTML with a fast syntax and that allows common patterns to be extruded out in to separate files.p  pIm aware of HAML.  I would love for HAML to be my solution.  But in all of my reading, HAML doesnt seem to have an equivalent to a SASSstyle include directive used for inlining the content of external files.  In addition, HAML seems to bill itself as more of a templating engine than an authoring tool the way SASS bills itself it seems to have a desire to be a replacement for ERB and to be used in Rails projects, rather than being used as a modular HTML preprocessor.p  pI know I could roll my own solution by bolting a small amount of Ruby and inline evaluation on to HAML, but it feels a little cheap and dirty since this isnt really what HAML wants to do.  Its not a solution Im averse to, but if there is a noconfiguration, lightweight option out there that basically behaves like SASS but for HTML then Id prefer to go that route.p

Negative 58338 pHi Im developing a phonegap  JQueryMobile app, which should be correctly executed on Android, iOs and WindowsPhone as well.p  pI need to exploit an external service wich requires one callback url to redirect the app to in case of success, and one in case of error pretty common situation. In my case both will be local files, say wwwsuccess.html and wwwerror.html. Of course I could write different paths for each device e.g. fileandroidassetwwwsuccess.html on Android, but im wondering if the framework provides a more elegant and solution.p  pSo the questions is, how can i get a unique absolute URL wich allows me to perform a crossplatform HTTP redirection from a remote web page to a local file within a phonegap applicationp  pThanksp

Negative 58338 pTo begin with Yes, Ive searched for an answer to this everywhere, but no one have had the same problem that i have. This question might seem to be the same as another question on here, but its most definitely not p  pBasically what i want to create is a Firststart activity that consists of 4 fragments with different layouts. This Ive managed to do myself. I also have an AsyncTask that will help one of the fragments with a call to a remote server to check if a user exists in a database. This also works. BUT, as soon as I rotate the phone and orientation changes the FragmentActivity is recreated obviously . If i do this when Ive fired the AsyncTask, it either crashes or in some cases finishes its user check.p  pSo my question is strongHow do I preserve the state of the AsyncTask if orientation changesstrong Ive seen some basic solutions using callbacks and to place the AsyncTask as an innerclass. They dont work in my case due to the layout of my pager adapter and the fact that the same Fragments class is used for all four fragments thats created.p  pAny help is much appreciated. Examples or solutions are even more appreciated p  pSee below for the ugly code that makes all of this come to life.p  pstrongFirstRunActivity.javastrongp  precodeimport android.content.Intent import

I examined codecat.classNamecode while the program was running, and it emdidem change correctly, for example codeL DJcode to codeL Dcode, in all my test browsers, however the cat would remain displaying the codeL DJcode graphics even though the className was codeL Dcode.p  pThis seems to be some sort of rendering problem.

In my real environment, the tiles load in Firefox too after first drag of the view.p  pEDIT2 The tiles didnt show at all in the fiddle because I had forgot to add the styles to fix bootstrap messing with the google map canvas. I added .mapcanvas img rule to the css and now it shows the initial problem. Tiles wont load until street view is dragged in Firefox.

Negative 58338 pI have the following problemp  pAn image is given and I am doing some blob detection. As a limit, lets say I have a max of 16 blobs and from each blob I calculate the centroid x,y position.

The assumption is that they keep more or less the grid form but they could be really much warped.p  pI need to sort the blobs such that I know which one is the nearest left, right, up and down. So the best would be to write these blobs into a matrix.p  pIf this is not enough, it could happen that I detect less then 16 and then I also need to sort them into a matrix.p  pDoes anyone know how this could be efficiently solved in Matlabp  pThanks.p  pstrong[update 1]strongp  pI uploaded an image and the red numbers are the numbers which my blob detection algorithm assign each blob.p  pThe resulting matrix should look like this with these numbersp  precode1   2   4   3 6   5   7   8 9  10  11  12 13 16  14  15 codepre  pe.g. I start with blob 11 and the nearest right number is 12 and so onp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO4LhY.png altexamplep  pstrong[update 2]strongp  pThe posted solution looks quite nice.

Negative 58338 pMy goal To pass a string into a Cwritten Direct3DComponent from a CXamlwritten Windows Phone Runtime component.p  pMy understanding This is accomplished using the D3DInterop.p  pTo be more specific, I am using the D3D with Xaml application template and attempting to pass a value to the Direct3DBackground object that is created when the DrawingSurfaceGrid is loaded.p  pThe template authors have accomplished this by copying over only trivial data types such as integers, but no examples of marshaling strings is given.

Negative 58338 pIn my AppStart.cshtml I fetch some data from the database, do calculations, serializedeserialize json strings and such, etc, and I store the result in a couple AppStatevariables by doing something like the followingCp  precodeAppState[myVar1]aString AppState[myVar2]anArray codepre  pThese variables are accessed frequently and are a bit heavy to define so I thought something like this would make sense rather than creating the data from scratch every time its needed. Even if the optimization isnt needed it still makes sense to me since it also increases readability and definitely maintainability by not having the same code in a bunch of places where that data is needed.p  pLikewise, I do similar actions on a peruser basis by putting data in Session whenver a user logs in, e.g.p  precodeSession[userVar1]myString Session[userVar2]myAray codepre  pHowever, Ive just read that we should never rely on that the data stored in these still exist when we want to read them because theyre stored in the servermemory which might have been cleared. Is this true So when we want to access one of these we should first check whether its null or not And if were lucky its not null and we can use it straight away, otherwise we set it again. Is this how data stored in AppState and Session are supposed to be used And if so, what would be a good way of resetting them if theyre null I suppose doing something like creating a function which sets them if theyre nullp

Negative 58338 pI am using Magento 1.7.0.2 and have encountered a problem when deleting products. I create 20 products in a clean install of magento using the product import routine. The products where assigned to categories, and had images associated with them.

This worked fine on the face of it and the products disappeared from the products grid.p  pI then attempted to reimport the products using the same format import file with some slightly different descriptions ect SKUs were the same as previously and I get an error saying that the SKU must be unique.p  pI have attempted creating a simple product in the back end with several of the now deleted SKUs and I get the same error  sku must be unique.p  pI have noticed that if I go into the category within the back end the deleted products are still listed against the category  I cant unassociate them as the products are not visible in the product list.p  pThe products are not visible within the store,and I have tried the followingp  ul lirefreshing the indexes and deleting the cash multiple timesli liUsing the mage api to try deleting the phantom items  this just errors as stock item not foundli liTried using the Mage and Soap APIs to recreate the item, but get the same SKU must be unique errorli ul  pDoes any body have any ideas I assume it should be possible to delete an item from the product list and recreate it p  pIf I cant fully delete the item is there a way for me to undelete it so I can then just update the profilep
Negative 58338 pIve been looking at QEMU for a while now and Ive been trying to find out if I can use it to simulate a device that we are developing. p  pThe device will be powered by an ARM Cortex M3 and QEMU is well suited for emulation of its software.p  pWhat I want to know is if anyone has used QEMU in the past as a simulatorp  pThe intent is to use QEMU to do blackbox testing of the software before rolling it out to the devices in the field.p  pThis would involve being able to monitor and modify the memory location in which your Parallel InputOutput PIO pins are configured and set and the memory locations of all other peripherals externally.p  pNow, considering that some of the peripherals would be PWM and UART, it is clear that there will be a need to resolve synchronization issues.

Negative 58338 pI have log4net setup to log to a database table.

I also have a custom object that has a boolean on it to tell me to create an open or close xml tag.p  pAll of this gets messed up because the log message is called, then the references are updated, then the buffer limit is hit and then the the layout is called using the updated references.p  pstrongIs there anyway to get log4net to call the layout right away, then buffer the database callsstrongp  pAlternatively, I can make sure that my log calls are always durable ie do the serialization before I make the log call.

The store has been using several methods that require two fields exemple sending an employee id and a record Id to verify if the record belongs to the employee and return more details. However, for some reason I have a method that simply refuses to work. Here is the method in the controllerp  precode    [HttpGet]     [ActionNameteste]     public IEnumerableltEmployeeProjectViewModelgt testeint iUserMasterId, int iEmployeeOrganizationsId              var Query  from eprojects in db.EmployeeProjects                     where eprojects.UserMasterId  iUserMasterId                     ampamp eprojects.Deleted  false                     ampamp eprojects.EmployeeOrganizationsId  iEmployeeOrganizationsId                     select new EmployeeProjectViewModel                                              EmployeeProjectsId  eprojects.EmployeeProjectsId,                         UserMasterId  eprojects.UserMasterId,                         Name  eprojects.ProjectName,                         Month  eprojects.ProjectMonth,                         Year  eprojects.ProjectYear,                         URL  eprojects.ProjectURL,                         Description  eprojects.ProjectDescription,                              return Query      codepre  pAnd the routeConfig codep  precode                routes.MapHttpRoute name teste, routeTemplate apicontrollertesteiUserMasterIdiEmployeeOrganizationsId, defaults new      action  teste  codepre  pThe error it gives me is 404 Method not found in controller verified with Fiddler.

Negative 58338 pCan a direct branch instruction with a lower target address than the address of the branch instruction itself be considered as the beginning of a loop Is this condition sufficient, or are there are other situations compiler optimizations, etc in which similar behaviour is shown on the instruction level.p  pWhat other approach would you recommend The obvious one is storing a list of target addresses encountered and if a target address is taken by the same instruction more than once, it means its the beginning of a loop. The downside of that is that it takes up memory of storing all the addresses and time for checks.p

Negative 58338 pThis question has been asked before, but the answers Ive found werent useful in my case.p  pWhen the user presses a button in Activity 1, Activity 2 is opened. Activity 2 has to load some data that has been stored in the SharedPreferences. Activity 2 has to do quite a lot in the onCreate, so thats why it takes a little while to open it especially on slower devices. Unlike the other cases Ive seen, the Activity doesnt have to download data from the internet, so using an AsyncTask isnt an option for me, because the reason why it takes long to open the Activity isnt internet, but the reason is that is has to load 5 listviews and it has to do a lot of calculations to process the data properly.p  pSo how do you display a ProgressDialog in this case, while Activity 2 is loadingp

Negative 58338 pI have a ViewPager that I shows more than one item. I used the solution of putting multiple items in one fragment and I created an Adapter that calculates how many items I can put per fragment based in the width of the screen.p  pThe getItem of my FragmentPagerAdapter creates a range of items for each fragment, dividing the quantity of items for each fragment.p  pFor example, I have 12 items and in the portrait orientation, I can put 3 items. The getItem will create fragments with the range of 02, 35, 68 and 911. In the landscape orientation, since the width of the screen is bigger, I can put, for example, 5 items. So, the ranges would be 04, 58 and 911.p  pWith this requirement, I need to create new Fragments and destroy the old ones on orientation changes.p  pI created a solution, but it depends on the method isChangingConfigurations of the Activity. But this method just exists for API level 11 and above. So I cant use it.p  pBasically, I Im not allowing the Fragment to save its state and Im removing it in the onPause if the configuration is changing. But since I dont have this method in old android versions, I need another solution.p  pCan anyone help mep

Negative 58338 pI am trying to load the details of a single product from a list of products displayed in a ListView into a FormView control using ASP.NET 4.5s model binding capability.p  pThis is all hosted in a single ASPX page which decides which to display using a Multiview control. In one view I have the ListView which displays all the products. In another view I have the FormView control to displayedit the details of a single product. When I click on a single product record in the ListView, I want to display the view that contains the FormView, and load that product into the FormView for editing or review.p  pFollowing direction for Model binding in WebForms, I have defined the SelectMethod property of the FormView with a method that takes a ProductId as its parameter. This method returns a single corresponding Product object. It is my understanding that somewhere in the lifecycle of the page this method is called and the FormView is automatically loaded.p  pNow, when I click on a record in the ListView to view its details, it fires the ItemCommand event handler. The event handler uses the Product Id from the selected record and retrieves the Product that corresponds to this Id.p  pThe problem comes in that I then need to bind that Product to the FormView. How do I manually assign the Product as the model that the FormView binds to When I attempt to manually set the DataSource of the FormView I get the errorp  blockquote   pemDataSource or DataSourceID cannot be defined on ProductForm when   it uses model binding.emp blockquote  pHas anyone else has this similar issue and figured out how to handle itp  pThanks,p  pGp

Negative 58338 pI believe the best practice for RESTful APIs is to be stateless.

Negative 58338 pIm writing an android app where I need to communicate with a computer on a wifi network. All the code is in java and the wifi network is an ad hoc network. In order to connect I start by sending a NBNS broadcast name query for for the machine I wish to connect to from my phone. Most times this works as expectedabout 3 or 4 out of 5 times. Sometimes though, the name query fails. In either case when I send out the name query, right after I see the name query packets on the machine Im attempting to connect tousing wireshark, I see an ARP query go out looking like...p  pHonHaiPr69a067   Broadcast   ARP 42  Who has 192.168.1.2  Tell 192.168.1.10p  pThats the card from the computer Im attempting to connect to asking who has my phones address.

The name query fails though when those ARP queries seem to go ignored by my phone. I never see an ARP response and the NBT query I put out winds up timing out. I have tried every form of datagramsocket initialization available to me in the standard java packages and nothing helps. I have researched writing my own arp response packets out, but because of where on the stack ARP is located, I need to have access to raw socket programming capabilities, which means I have to root my phone. This is an unacceptable solution for me because I want the average android user to be able to use this app without having to do anything special to their phone or their wifi network. If any of you have experienced this problem before and solved it, could you please let me know the magic formula Thanks in advance for any input you can offer.p

Negative 58338 pcodemakecode is halting and reporting an error code of 12 after attempting to codezip ucode some files.p  pThe error code 12 is actually an exit status from zip which indicates that it has nothing to do.p  pI dont understand why this is a nonzero exit status.  Wouldnt it be more appropriate to just let zip quietly do nothing  It doesnt seem like an actual problem if zip has nothing to do.p  pI could suppress it tell codemakecode to ignore nonzero exit status from zip by calling codezip ucode.  But the problem with that approach is that 12 is the only exit status I want to ignore.  All of the others indicate actual problems that would cause me to want to abort codemakecode.p  pMaybe I could set a variable equal to the output from codeecho code and then test for 0 or 12 but it seems klodgy to do this after every single codezipcode statement in the .mk file.p  pIs there an elegant way to handle thisp

Negative 58338 pI seem to have encountered a weird problem with my website. When I am on the home page and then click one of the tabs, it works as it should. As soon as I try to click from one of the other tabs to another tab in my example, from News to Beats, from Beats to News, from News to Home and from Beats to Home the content of the tab movesshifts for a second and then switches. It never used to do this and it seemed to just start doing it all of the sudden. I was just wondering if anyone else has encountered this problem or if anyone knows of a solution. Here is the link to my websitep  pa hrefhttpgscobeats.com relnofollowhttpgscobeats.comap  pJust to clarify, what Im talking about is when you go on my site and let the whole thing load and click one of the tabs, the page does a fading transition effect then the page you selected appears.

Negative 58338 pSomehow I find this confusingp  pIf your activities and bound service run in the same process, and you want to communicate asynchronously between activity and bound service which is set to the foreground using a notification, how do you use handlers on both sides The part that I dont understand is that both the activityside and serviceside run in the same thread the UIthread. That means THE SAME HANDLERp  pI used to program it like this In my bound service I create a Handler, put that handler into a Messenger, return the Messenger in the onBind method. On the activityside I create a ServiceConnection object with onServiceConnected and onServiceDisconnected. I also create a client Handler and put that in a client Messenger object. I also define a service Messenger object which gets its Messenger object handed out in the onServiceConnected method of the ServiceConnection object. Everything is setup now.p  pI believe I could remove the whole Messenger part between the activity and service and only use a local binder object because the activity and the service run on the same uithread. That way you only have ONE thread for both sides and two handlers and two Messengers. Why have two handlersmessengers in the same thread Is that the ONLY way to get asynchronous communication I dont want to call methods in the service directly from the activity as you normally would do using a local Binder object, because that is synchronous communicationp

Negative 58338 pI recently started my journey to Symfony2 world. The archive I downloaded Standard edition comes with a demo bundle the AcmeDemoBundle.  I tried to code along with the Symfony2 book provided by the official site. So I created a bundle of my ownEXPHelloBundle through  the Symfony2 console. Then, I created the controller associated with the current bundle.p  pThe problem is this Whenever I run my app localhostappdev.phphellowhatever browser prints hello whatever. I know that this message runs from the AcmeDemoBundle the bundle that comes with Symfony2 archive. Whatever changes I make to my EXPHelloController.php, the app naturally runs the AcmeDemoBundle as a default. To put it simply, I dont know how to tell Symfony2 to run my bundle instead of the demo bundle. p

Negative 58338 pI have an input file element within an angular viewform. Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwilson63ngUpload relnofollownguploada like thisp  precodeltinput idimg typefile nameimage onchangeangular.elementthis.scope.setFilethisgt ltinput idimgname typehidden valuegtltdivgt codepre  pSince I cant tell angular to listen for changes on codeinput[typefile]code element, Ive created the method that updates the hidden input that just holds the current filename. That way I can run my validator on the second field.p  pAnother field I have has some sort of validator, like thisp  precodeltinput ngmodelother ngchangechggt codepre  pNow, the trouble is, if I trigger the validator, codescope.chgcode, from codesetFilecode method, I think I dont get the same scope  codechgcode runs, but its as if the validator is in another scope and doesnt set my actual submit button to enabled. I tried logging from the chg  it shows different scope then what I actually see on the view.p  pAnd if I later trigger the ngchange by changing the regular input field strongotherstrong, it picks up the changes, or actually, it sets the submit button state correctly.p  pNow, I suspect this has to do with me calling the emangular.elementthis.scope.setFilethisem from my form instead of direct, scopebound method. But I cannot call scopebound method because it does not trigger  if I understood correctly, thats due to Angular not yet working with eminput typefileem fields.p  pWhat can I do herep  pI simply want to detect if there is a file or not so I can enabledisable the submit button appropriately.p

Negative 58338 pIm working on a game written in C using VS2013 and monogame. However, monogame doesnt support the XNA content pipeline emstillem, so the going advice is to build your content separately using Microsofts XNA and VS2010. Since I didnt want to clutter my primary development machine Win8 with VS2010 et cetera, I created a Win7 virtual machine to run Win7 along with VS2010 and all the tooling I need to build my content. All my project and solution files have corresponding 2010 versions, and the 2010 solution only has the necessary projects to build the content.p  pI can successfully build the content, but only if its present direcly on the VMs hard disk emCem. If I map a local drive to a network share on the host machine and attempt to build, I get a build time error. Why do I want to do this Because I want a single copy of the source tree so I can iterate at a decent speed. Its just far too painful and errorprone if I have a separate source tree in the VM.p  pHeres the build error I getp  precodeError loading pipeline assembly SSrcContentPipelineExtensionbinx86DebugNewtonsoft.Json.dll. codepre  pI have emSem mapped to my network share. emNewtonsoft.Json.dllem exists at the indicated path.p  pI have triedp  ul lispecifying codeverbositydcode when building to see if any more information is output.

Negative 58338 pstrongEDITstrong I have now solved the problem you can see my solution in the answers.p  pIm in the process of writing a realtime raytracer using OpenGL in a GLSL Compute Shader, and Ive run into a slight problem with some of my linetriangle intersections or at least, I believe they are the culprit.  Heres a picture of whats happeningp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEWnaq.png altSpheres in a room with some artifactsp  pAs you can see some pixels are being coloured black at the intersection of two triangles near the top of the image.  Its probably got something to do with the way Im handling floats or something, and Ive tried searching for a solution online but cant find similar situations.  Perhaps theres an important keyword Im missingp  pAnyways, the important piece of code is this onep  precodedefine EPSILON 0.001f define FARCLIP 10000.0f float FindRayTriangleIntersectionRay r, Triangle p       Based on MollerTrumbone paper     vec3 E1  p.v1  p.v0     vec3 E2  p.v2  p.v0     vec3 T  r.origin  p.v0     vec3 D  r.dir     vec3 P  crossD, E2     vec3 Q  crossT, E1      float f  1.0f  dotP, E1     float t  f  dotQ, E2     float u  f  dotP, T     float v  f  dotQ, D      if u gt EPSILON ampamp v gt EPSILON ampamp uv lt 1.0fEPSILON return t     else return FARCLIP  codepre  pIve tried various values for codeEPSILONcode, tried variations with  for the codeEPSILONcode values, but to no avail.  Also, changing the code1.0fEPSILONcode to a code1.0EPSILONcode yields a steady black line the whole way across.p  pAlso to clarify, there definitely is NOT a gap between the two triangles.  They are tightly packed and I have also tried extending them so they intersect, but I still get the same black dots.p  pCuriously enough, the bottom intersection shows no sign of this phenomenon.p  pLast note if more of my code is needed just ask and Ill try to isolate some more code or maybe just link to the entire shader.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong It was pointed out that the black artifacts are in fact brown.  So Ive dug a bit deeper and turned off all reflections, and got this resultp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu7IWN.png altSpheres without reflectionsp  pThe brown colour is actually coming from just the copper material on the top, but more importantly I think I have an idea what the cause of the problem is, but Im no closer to solving it.p  pIt seems that when the rays get fired out, due to very slight imperfections in the floating arithmetic, some rays intersect the top triangle, and some intersect the bottom.p  pSo I suppose now the question reduces to this how can I have some sort of consistency in deciding which triangle should be hit in cases like thisp

Negative 58338 pIm trying to implement a web prefetching system. The purpose of a system like this is to predict future requests and prefetch them.  p  pThe system builds a predictive model from web navigation logs Squid access.log files. The model is a dependency graph, where a node representing URL A has an arc to a node representing URL B if URL B has been requested immediately after URL A.  p  pOnce the model is built, the system receives queries of URLs requested by users, and make predictions based on the graph. Predictions are resources URLs very likely to be requested in the future. So, based on predictions, the system prefetches these resources to store them in cache prior to users requests.  p  pIm using the following testing scenario  p  ul liA process simulate multiple clients, requesting URLs in a file using libcurl. The process runs in a different PC from the prefetching system. PCs are connected directly via an ethernet cable  li liRequests made by the client simulator are always the same URLs in the same relative time from the first request made. All requests are going to port 3128 Prefetch PC Squid listen port port 80 DNAT to port 3128 in the client.  li liThe prefetching system runs in a CentOS 6.3 box, kernel 2.6.3271.el6.i686, 2 core Intel Pentium 4 3.00GHz processor, 4 GB RAM.  li liThe prefetching system is one process with multiple threads. The main thread creates the predictive model and generates predictions based on queries. A listener thread reads URLs requested by users and prefetches predicted URLs using libcurl. Listening means reading from a named pipe called urlfifo URLs captured live on an interface using tsharkbr codestdbuf o0 tshark i eth1 tcp port 3128 and  tcp[tcp[121] amp 0xf0 gtgt 24]  0x47455420 T fields e http.request.fulluri gtgt urlfifocode   li liEach 10 minutes 1 cycle the model is updated based on requests from the last cycle. The client tells the system when a cycle ends and so the model is updated. Once the model is updated, the system tells the client to start requesting URLs from the next cycle.  li ul  pHere is the situation Sometimes reading from the named pipe freezes. No URLs are read from the pipe even though tshark keeps capturing URLs and redirecting them to the named pipe. After an hour or a couple of hours all buffered URLs are read in less than 10 minutes. After that, reading from the pipe keeps going ok again. This situation doesnt happen always 50 of times freezes, 50 no.  p  pIt seems that there is a buffering issue, since tshark keeps capturing URLs and all requests are correctly logged in Squids access.log.p  pIn the beginning, I ran tshark with the codelcode option, so that its output becomes line buffered. Then I started using codestdbuf o0code no buffering. Anyway the situation still happens. p  pIn the system code, I also tried opening and reading the named pipe as a stream codeFILE code and set the stream as no buffered or line buffered using codesetvbufcode function. The situation still happened.  p  pIn some cycles requests are faster than in other cycles. Anyway, it doesnt seems to be a fast producer slow consumer issue, since in many repetitions of the test all URLs are correctly read and processed without any freezes.  p  pIs there something am I missing related to named pipes and buffering Id really appreciate some guidance.  p  pAssume networking interfaces, routing, iptables, squid is ok. Ive not had any issues related to it.p    pCode assume necessary header files are includedbr functions.cp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodedefine BUFLEN 512 define QUEUELEN 64 define THREADSLEN

Deleting this folder via code[NSFileManager removeItemAtPath]code takes a nontrivial amount of time.  But on OS X, deleting a folder with the same contents is very fast.

The rules are like this onep  precodeRewriteCond QUERYSTRING ampnameYourAccountamp [NC] RewriteRule  suchen [L,R301] codepre  pIn this case, all urls that contain nameYourAccount are redirected to the search page. However, it is considered best practice to return a 404 or even a 410 status.

Heres how I coded the shortcodep  precodefunction sldsshortcode atts     extract shortcodeatts array     slideshow gt   all,     timeout   gt  5000,   , atts     slideshow  atts[slideshow]   global post   tmppost  post   args  array slideshows gt slideshow, timeout gt timeout,    myposts  getposts args    obstart  Helps output the HTML where the shortcode is otherwise it outputs before the content.       gt   ltdiv idltphp echo slideshow gt classsldsslideshowgt     ltdiv classtimeoutltphp echo timeout gtgt     ltphp foreach myposts as post   setuppostdatapost gt       ltdiv classslidegt        ltphp thecontent gt       ltdivgt     ltphp endforeach gt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltphp   post  tmppost     return obgetclean      addshortcodeslides, sldsshortcode codepre  pThe scripts and stylesheet are included in the footer, only if a shortcode is found in the post. The script responsiveslides.js requires an init, which currently outputs in the footer whether a shortcode is found in the post or not. Heres how I generate thatp  precodefunction sldsinit    echo    ltscriptgt     jQueryfunction        document.readyfunction          .sldsslideshow .timeout5000.responsiveSlides           pause true,           nav true,           pager true,           timeout 5000,           speed 1800                  .sldsslideshow .timeout10000.responsiveSlides           pause true,           nav true,           pager true,           timeout 10000,           speed 1800                        ltscriptgt    addactionwpfooter, sldsinit codepre  pThis works great, so long as the defaults I coded in there are suitable for the project. Instead, Id like to be able to set these parameters in the shortcode like [slides slideshowtour timeout10000 speed1200]. As you can see above, the init has a few major limitations. It selects ALL instances of .sldsslideshow instead of selecting each shortcode output individually by a unique id or class, meaning these default parameters have to be used for all shortcode outputs. In fact, the reason I have two jQuery selectors is so I can add an alternate .timeout class to the output, which just changes which jQuery selector is affecting the shortcode output or slideshow HTML if you will. This is a shoddy solution. Obviously if I relied on classes for all the parameters this way, with the virtually infinite number of parameter combinations, the init would become extremely heavy and clunky.p  pHow can I generate that middle section of the init the jQuery selectors and their parameters based on the shortcode attributes in such a way that they still correlate to the HTML output of the shortcodes in the postp  hr  h2Edith2  pThanks again birgire for your ideas I think they got me much closer to where I need to be. p  pI tried out a lot of options. I think the main thing Im still running into is getting shortcode instances to generate anything in my javascript initialization.

Hoping this will keep the array keys from overwriting eachother.   sldsvars.instance.responsiveSlides     pause true,     nav true,     pager true,     timeout timeout,     speed speed     codepre  pOf course, I realized after I saw this result...p  precodeltscriptgt   jQueryfunction      document.readyfunction          ltscriptgt codepre  pI cant select the variable from outside my shortcode function like I was attempt to dop  precodefunction sldsinit  gt   ltscriptgt     jQueryfunction        document.readyfunction  ltphp echo jQselectors gt               ltscriptgt ltphp       addactionwpfooter, sldsinit   codepre  pIm having trouble wrapping my head around how to do this.

Negative 58338 pMy question is related to the improving performance of the aspx page. So after reading this Post, please comment whether it is even possible to improve the performance of this page.p  pHere is the scenario.p  pI am working on one asp.net web application with following toolsp  ol li.Net 3.5li liTyped Dataset10 tablesli liIE 8 Compatibility ViewIE7 StandardsApp does not work on FF,Chrome or any other browserli liTelerik RadControls.

Approx 30k lines in code behind, 5k lines in jS and around 4k lines htmljs combinedin the aspx page.  There is complex logic in the code behind which runs on page load as well as every partial post back, and most of the grids are rebinded on almost every postback.p  pThings we did to improve performancewhich did not help much.  Note Rewriting the entire page again was not an option so all the enhancements had to go in this page. p  ol liMinified all javascripts, CSSli liAdded all scripts in Radscript mangaers Script collectionI dont know if this would help in any case, but was told to do so. li liMoved all the javascript written on aspx to js files from RadScriptBlockli liRefactored lot of code and minimized the use of appfabricpush,get.li liRadCompression is already implemented.li liAll Grids use serverpaging 5 records per page.li ol  pPage has hardly any static contents.  Page Caching, Fragment caching is not possible looking at the usage of this pagep  pI dont know if this surprises anyone, but the partial postback operations on this page takes around 46 secondsRequestResponseRender. I think that is pretty fas, looking at the code that is running in the background. But the client doesnt feel like that. p  pThe expectation is that any operation on the page should not take more than 11.5 seconds.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liIs it possible to get this performance boost looking at the infrastructure used in this pageli liIf at all it is possible what are the things that I am missing and that could make the page perform better.li liI have seen that the ItemCreated and ItemDatabound of each grid is called lot many more times than the codeRowCountcode.

Negative 58338 pI have one table that has a codeCodecode and a codeTypecode property. I have another table which has a codefooidcode property. The codefooidcode is a codeCodecode of codeType  foocode so when creating a constraint between these two tables I need to match codeCodecode to codefooidcode and codeTypecode to the constant codeFoocode. p  pIs there a way to do this I dont want to add an codeTypecode column to my second table that is going to have the same value for emevery single rowem because that seems like a waste.p  precodeTable 1                    Table 2 Code     lt  Fooid                   Fooid maps to Code Type     ltFoo                                  But Table 2 doesnt have a property                                                      that maps to Type.

When I click on that association and then click on the Referential Constraint, I can see codeCodecode and codeTypecode for the principle key, but I only have codefooidcode I can use for the Dependent Property. So I want to specify that the constraint for codeTypecode should be a constant. p  pThere are, of course, other values for codeTypecode other than codeFoocode, but codeTable 2code in particular is only concerned with codeFoocode types.p  pI can work around it by just doing something likep  precodevar x  from i in Table2         select new  someT2Prop  i.Table2Prop,                      someT1Prop  from r in Table1 where r.Code  i.Fooid                                     ampamp r.Type  Foo select r.Table1Prop.FirstOrDefault  codepre  pBut thats kind of messy.

Negative 58338 pIm building a very numberheavy app and one feature of the app is to be able to filter between the three results at the end. These are Drugs, Disease amp All both.p  pIm pretty new to Knockout so not totally sure what the bestpractise way to approach the following situation would be.p  pI have the values filtering, my problem lies with computing the new values. strongThe totals at the bottom have to reflect what data is currently visible in the table.strong Although these cell values apart from totals in the codepen below are static, theyre actually dynamic in my app and theyre a computed combination of a couple of values that are stored in sessionStorage in the app on previous pages. This screen is a totals page.p  pExamplep  pcodeself.total  ko.computedfunction         return sessionStorage.getItem1  sessionStorage.getItem2 codep  pSo to clarify initially the computed totals at the bottom of the table are a total sum of numbers in the table cells that are multiplications of numbers from sessionStorage. The totals values then need to update every time the table is filtered to reflect the total of the visible data.p  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpennlemE relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpennlemEap  pI appreciate this may be complicated to get your head around and if I havent explained it well enough, let me know and Ill clarify.p

Negative 58338 pI am building a tool that can send CoAP messages to another peer different implementation, but I am having difficulties. I am using the CoAP library called Californium and am developing the tool in javaeclipse. Heres the deal I send a message over californiums default endpoint, which allows the system to make up a sourceport for the UDP connection. I want to listen on this same sourceport using californiums Server object, but I am getting the following errorp  precodeSEVERE Could not start endpoint java.net.BindException Address already in use codepre  pSo my question is how do I first send a CoAP message and start listening for other CoAP messages on the same socket using Californiump  pBelow is the java code for the client. What it does is register using a certain protocol layered on top of CoAP. After registering I want it to reuse the UDP socket for listening for subsequent messages of the entity I registered with earlier.p  pstrongemNOTEemstrong The server part of the client works when I explicitly tell it to listen to a certain port e.g. 5683, leave out the register part and test it with the Firefox Addon Copper i.e. Copper can get to the 1 11 110 resources.p  precodepackage com.example.l2mwm.client  import java.net.InetSocketAddress  import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.coap.CoAP.Code import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.coap.CoAP.ResponseCode import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.coap.CoAP import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.coap.Request import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.coap.Response import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.network.Endpoint import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.network.EndpointManager import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.server.Server import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.server.resources.CoapExchange import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.server.resources.Resource import ch.ethz.inf.vs.californium.server.resources.ResourceBase  public class Main       public static void mainString[] args          Endpoint endpoint         if endpoint  register  null              listenendpoint          else              System.out.printlnCouldnt register                    private static void listenEndpoint endpoint          InetSocketAddress sockAddress  endpoint.getAddress         int port  sockAddress.getPort         Server server  new Serverport         Resource topResource  new ResourceBase1              Override             public void handleGETCoapExchange exchange                  exchange.respondResponseCode.CONTENT, this is 1s value                           Override             public String getPath                  return                                 Resource instanceResource  new ResourceBase1              Override             public void handleGETCoapExchange exchange                  exchange.respondResponseCode.CONTENT, this is 11s value                           Override             public String getPath                  return 1                                topResource.addinstanceResource          instanceResource.addnew ResourceBase0              Override             public void handleGETCoapExchange exchange                  exchange.respondResponseCode.CONTENT, this is 110s value                           Override             public String getPath                  return 11                                server.addtopResource          server.start           private static Endpoint register          Request request  new RequestCode.POST         request.setURIlocalhost5684rdepcoapclientamplt86400ampbU         request.setPayloadlt110gt         Endpoint endpoint  EndpointManager.getEndpointManager.getDefaultEndpoint         request.sendendpoint          Response response         ResponseCode responseCode  null          try              response  request.waitForResponse          catch InterruptedException e              System.out.printlne.getMessage             return null                   responseCode  response.getCode         if responseCode  CoAP.ResponseCode.CREATED              return null                   return endpoint        codepre

However, because Im using CodeIgniter as a framework of my application, I cant get it to work properly. I have a controller where Im loading all of my Dashboards views, ones I want display inside my div called contentcontainer.p  pThe problem is that every time I click another anchor tag to get different view to load through ajax request, it adds another dashboard in my url and of course it doesnt display the view after that.

Negative 58338 pIm new to python, and Im making a program for a friend. I was wondering if its possible to call a function in another function, for example like thisp  precodedef hundredsCheck     if till.hundreds gt 0         till.hundreds  1         total  100         deposit.hundreds  1         deposit.total  100         return     else             fiftiesCheck             return codepre  pIn this case, fiftiesCheck is a function that is defined just below hundredsCheck, and follows a much similar format. I have two classes as well, till and deposit, and they just contain values like the ones used in the example I listed.p  pIm doing this to save space in a tiered if statement that takes up a lot of room, so this would be far simpler. If this is a viable method, then please say so, along with any other advice you may have.p

Negative 58338 pSay I have a data that describes different items sold and when they were sold. I want to breakdown this data and count different items sold on monthly basis. So here is what I have so farp  precodeSELECT   ItemDescription ,OrderReceivedData  ,COUNT AS ItemCount  INTO CUserswhatever.csv  FROM CuserinputFileHere.csv  GROUP BY ItemDescription, OrderReceivedDate  HAVING OrderReceivedDate LIKE 2011 codepre  pNow the thing is that my dates are in a bad format. So what the query above does is that it shows count for an item on 01JAN2011, 02JAN2011, ... , 10FEB2011, ...and so on. But what I want is the count for JAN2011, FEB2011, MAR2011... and so on. So basically I dont wanna GROUP BY OrderReceivedData but I want to Group by these specific 7 characters in OrderReceivedDate so I can ignore the dates. I hope it makes sense. So how do I do this p
Negative 58338 pIm trying to solve a large eigenvalue problem with Scipy where the matrix codeAcode is dense but I can compute its action on a vector without having to assemble codeAcode explicitly. So in order to avoid memory issues when the matrix A gets big Id like to use the sparse solver codescipy.sparse.linalg.eigscode with a codeLinearOperatorcode that implemements this action.p  pApplying codeeigscode to an explicit numpy array codeAcode works fine. However, if I apply codeeigscode to a codeLinearOperatorcode instead then the iterative solver fails to converge. This is true even if the codematveccode method of the codeLinearOperatorcode is simply matrixvector multiplication with the given matrix codeAcode.p  pA minimal example illustrating the failure is attached below Im using shiftinvert mode because I am interested in the smallest few eigenvalues. This computes the eigenvalues of a random matrix codeAcode just fine, but fails when applied to a codeLinearOperatorcode that is directly converted from codeAcode. I tried to fiddle with the parameters for the iterative solver codev0code, codencvcode, codemaxitercode but to no avail.p  pAm I missing something obvious Is there a way to make this work Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Many thanksp  pstrongEditstrong I should clarify what I mean by make this work thanks, Dietrich. The example below uses a random matrix for illustration. However, in my application I know that the eigenvalues are almost purely imaginary or almost purely real if I multiply the matrix by code1jcode. Im interested in the 1020 smallestmagnitude eigenvalues, but the algorithm doesnt behave well i.e., never stops even for smallish matrix sizes if I specify codewhichSMcode. Therefore Im using shiftinvert mode by passing the parameters codesigma0.0, whichLMcode. Im happy to try a different approach so long as it allows me to compute a bunch of smallestmagnitude eigenvalues. p  precodefrom scipy.sparse.linalg import eigs, LinearOperator, aslinearoperator import numpy as np   Set a seed for reproducibility np.random.seed0   Size of the matrix N  100   Generate a random matrix of size N x N  and compute its eigenvalues A  np.random.randomsampleN, N eigvals  eigsA, sigma0.0, whichLM, returneigenvectorsFalse print eigvals   Convert the matrix to a LinearOperator Aop  aslinearoperatorA   Try to solve the same eigenproblem again.

And map the oracle tables.li ol  pSo I am assuming that Entity Framework 6 will generate the same codemodel.edmxcode class regardless of the database vendor .

Negative 58338 pOur current setup is to use codeocibindbynamecode when retrieving data from an Oracle database. However, in doing so we must define a codemaxlengthcode to set the maximum length of the data so that PHP allocates enough memory to hold the returned value.

Negative 58338 pIm hoping I just missed something in the README somewhere, but...p  pI have a library of VB.net code that Im trying to package into a PCL, ultimately for use under Xamarin. The code is relatively straightforward, theres a lot of File IO using streams and some SQL client code, and a smaller amount of UI and control related code.p  pSo I made a new PCL project, but I was confused what to select, so I chose Windows Store and .Net 4.5.

Now Im getting errors on the most basic things  ArrayList does not appear to exist in spite of importing System.Collections, and StackTrace doesnt exist in Diagnostics. Even simple things like StringFormat and SortedDictionary arent there.p  pDid I skip a step somewhere Perhaps I didnt download the right libs from MS Or maybe I have to manually include a Reference to something Any ideasp

Negative 58338 pSo I finally got Masonry to work with my NexGen gallery plugin.  Pagination appears at the bottom of the first page after applying a CSS rule.  Im trying to make it so that I can go to any page and see different gallery images.p  pUsing a custom permalinks structure codenggallerycode the NextGen permalink slug so my links looks like this codehttp  funnykittenmemes.comnggallerynggallerypage2code. I can get to page 2 of the gallery but then the pagination disappears and the Masonry layout is not there anywhere images are not stacked on top of each other....instead, they are in rows.p  pGoing to page 3 and 4, I get an error with the images still in rowsp  precodeWarning Division by zero in homefunnykitpublichtmlwpcontentpluginsnextgengalleryproductsphotocratinextgenmodulesnextgendataclass.gallerystoragedriverbase.php on line 1093  Warning Division by zero in homefunnykitpublichtmlwpcontentpluginsnextgengalleryproductsphotocratinextgenmodulesnextgendataclass.gallerystoragedriverbase.php on line 1096 width190 height162 gt codepre  pNow, using the default permalink so my links look liks this codehttp  funnykittenmemes.comindex.phpnggallerypage2p1code, no images appear.p  pKinda confused on how to make pagination work.p  pOther people have reported this problem but they are using other templates and other custom permalinks.  I am using the Basic Thumbnail layout with Masonry integrated but I want to have the clean codenggallerypage2image.jpgcode URLp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOh yea, I would also like to add that using the custom permalink codecode allows the nggallery link structure to follow so it looks like codehttp  funnykittenmemes.comnggallerypage2code where  codenggallerypage2code follows the codecode.  Now the problem is that every page after the first page does not show the pagination.  The pagination bar shows up on first page than disappears after that.  I used firebug to figure out where the bar was and it was actually hidden in the footer but not visible.  It becomes visible if I use marginbottom to push it up but then it will also be pushed up on the first page.  So it will not look the same one first and second pages.p

Negative 58338 pIn my code I have an object called codeDataLoggercode.

Every time a new event comes in, the data will be logged into a file. The data logger should be started with the codestartcode method and stopped with the codestopcode method. The problem I see with this code is, that if the client  caller of the DataLogger calls codestopcode it can be the case that an event just arrived at the same moment which will then be logged, although the user has called codestopcode before. This can lead even to a crash if the data stream is already closed. I guess I need to add some synchornization  Locking code here is this right Whats the best way to extend my codep

Negative 58338 pI have a multiline codeUILabelcode, which will display contents at run time, contents may only need 1 line or up to 3 lines.p  pWhen there is less contents, Id like the label using a larger font size, and when there are more contents, I want the label to use multiple lines and smaller font size.p  pDue to autolayout, I cant set the frame of codeUILabelcode, and the frame of the label is unknown until run time, so that it can be compatible with different devices.p  pCurrently I set line number of the label as a fixed number, which will divide contents into multiple lines when there is more contents, but when there is less contents, the single line uses a font size as small as when there is more contents.

Negative 58338 pDear StackOverflow Usersp  pI am currently working on a data analysis web app.p  pNow in this app you can drag and drop graphs  and you can remove it by unselecting it. Also you can add the graph with a plus button. Only problem is there is no way to unselect it when you add it by that plus buttonWhich I put the code of  tbadd.button p  pWhat I am trying to do is find a way to write a function button that would undo what the add graph button did, or close it or delete it, since there is no unselect button.p  pMy question is Is there such a javascript function that would undo or remove what the tbadd.button did. p  pso lets say I want to add a button called tbremove.button is there any simple javascript that would simply undo what was added  If there is what is it called  can you direct me to it  p  pThank youp

Negative 58338 pWe are currently discussing how to define our goals on code coverage in a C project this question is not limited to C though. On the way, we found that we should exclude some code from being counted. The most obvious are the tests themselves, as they have 100 coverage and should not influence the average. But there are also classes that are wrappers for system calls we need to be able to create mocks. They are untestable, as we dont want to test system libraries. The code is calculated towards the coverage though and makes it hard to move across the 90 mark.p  pWe do not want to lie at ourselves by excluding every piece of code that is untested, which makes it fairly easy to walk towards 100.p  pThe question is Is there any reference, article or discussion on this topic with experience in this area We would like to explore the different views on this topic that may help us finding and developing our definition for testable code.p
Negative 58338 pI an currently working on the admin features for an ecommerce application that features the capacity to create bundles of products and sell said bundles. However, the contents of each bundle must be different two different bundles can be comprised of the same items, provided that they have different quantities on at least one of the items. Im trying to implement a check that enforces this. Given that bundle creations are often batch processed on a very large scale, I need for this process to be fairly fast. p  pThe tables that I am working with are in MySQL and look like thisp  precodePRODUCTS  product ID [other product attributes, like name, cost, etc.]   BUNDLES  bundle ID [other bundle attributes, like name, cost, etc.]   BUNDLE CONTENTS  bundle ID product ID quantity of product required for bundle codepre  pNote that each row of the BUNDLE CONTENTS table must be unique.p  pAfter some initial processing, the contents of the potential bundle come in as a multidimensional array of product IDs already confirmed to exist in the database and the corresponding required quantity of that product. p  pIve tried the following approaches to the issue, but found that each of them was too computation intensive for the desired response time note that I can and have split processing between the database and the PHP webserver as needed.p  pApproach 1p  ul liSplit the array up so that a single product ID and the corresponding quantity are getting processed at a time, via PHP li liFor each product ID  quantity pairli liUse mySQL to find potential bundle matches by looking for bundles that contain the specified product at at the specified quantity, and also contain the specified number of products the length of the product ID array.li liPush the bundle IDs of the potentially matching bundles onto a PHP arrayli liOnce all products have been used to find potential bundle matches, eliminate duplicate entries from the PHP arrayli liUse that same array to check the contents of each bundle, in a for each bundle, for each product configurationli liIf one of the bundles matches exactly, break the loop and return the bundle ID for the bundle that has identical contents, so that an error log for that particular entry in the batch process can be written.li ul  pApproach 2p  ul liPull in the productID section of the array, and the number of items in said array.li liSelect the distinct bundle IDs for all bundles that contain any of the product IDs, using a productID IN [contents of array], and that have the appropriate number of productsli liPush the bundle IDs out to a PHP array, making double sure to eliminate any duplicatesli liUse that array to check the contents of each bundle listed to see for an exact matchli liIf an exact match is found, return that bundle ID for the previously discussed error logli ul  pApproach 3p  ul liPull in the productIDs and the quantities, splitting the multidimensional array into two arrays, making sure to keep them in the proper order, and thus be able to reference a products corresponding quantity by matching indexes in the arrays. Also pull in the number of products entries.li liLimit the initial search field to just bundles that contain the appropriate number of productsli liCheck the contents of each bundle against the list of required items and corresponding quantities, continuing the check to the next bundle if a required item is not found, and breaking the check entirely if a bundle is an exact matchli liIf an exact match was found, return it for the error log.li ul  pGiven the large number of bundles that already exist and the similarly large number of bundles that will need to be checked before being created, the amount of time and processing that the above approaches take is not meeting requirements. p  pTo clarify my point, examplesp  pstrongBundle 1 Contentsstrongp  ul li2x Red Cupli li2x Red Bowlli ul  pstrongemFirst Ever Bundle, No Check Necessaryemstrong p  pstrongBundle 2 Contentsstrongp  ul li2x Red Cupli li2x Red Bowlli ul  pstrongemFAILemstrongp  pstrongBundle 3 Contentsstrongp  ul li2x Red Cupli li3x Red Bowlli ul  pstrongemPASSemstrongp  pstrongBundle 4 Contentstrongp  ul li2x Red Bowlli li2x Red Cupli ul  pstrongemFAILemstrongp  pstrongBundle 5 Contentsstrongp  ul li2x Red Bowlli li2x Red Napkinli li2x Red Cupli ul  pstrongemPASSemstrongp  pEDIT I should wish to point out that while the above examples are small bundles, we operate with a lot of very big bundles, which is where a lot of the processing time comes in at.p  pThus far, I cannot find any way to just simply tell mySQL to return the bundle ID of a bundle if it exists, return NULL otherwise where the contents of BUNDLE CONTENTS exactly match the multidimensional array in any row order for that particular bundle, without implementing an inane number of loopbased calculations.p  pI would greatly appreciate any insight into this situation. Thanks in advance.p

I wanted to add the App Icon and change the app display name and found out that it had to be done over the AndroidManifest.xml file. So after finally finding where to add it in the QtCreator, I added an Icon and changed the name. When I click deploy, it loads and then the bar turns red, without ANY error messages or nothing. It just goes red full and then goes away. Even the warnings from build are not even showing. p  pI hope you guys can help me, this is my first question, so if I forgot any information or asked the question wrong, please let me know p

Negative 58338 pI have a third party library that is a dynamic lib libthirdparty.so. How do I go about including this into my VS2012 solution I have already tried adding it as a dependency under LinkerInputAdditional Dependencies and it compiles, but at runtime, my app crashes immediately. Also, my apk without the third party lib is about 9MB and the dynamic lib is 20MB by itself, so if it were included the APK size would jump at least a few MBs, but it doesnt. So I think that at compile time VS finds the .so fine, but doesnt include it into the generated apk.p  pEdit I got my libthirdparty.so to be included in the apk by adding it as a dependancy in the ant build settings, but the behavior is the same it crashes on launch.

Negative 58338 pIn Javascript, Im creating a number of blobs that I want to prompt the user to save as files.  At the moment, Im doing that using codeURL.createObjectURLcode, placing the URL in a link, and simulating a click to the link.  Of course I call codeURL.revokeObjectURLcode to release the URL so the blob can be discarded after the user saves it.  I have a loop that runs through and does this for each blob I want the user to save.p  pAt least on Firefox, triggering the link is an asynchronous operation I call codeclickcode and my loop to generate the rest of the blobs immediately continues execution before the user chooses a location to save the file.p  pThis presents a bit of a problem because each blob could be somewhat large, and there could be a lot of them.  I can easily foresee a situation where there wouldnt be sufficient memory to hold all of them in memory waiting for the user to save and release them onebyone.  So Id like to generate one blob, have the user download it, and then, emafterem the file has been saved and thus is eligible to be discarded by the garbage collector, proceed to generate the next blob and have the user save it.p  pIs there any way to achieve this without requiring the user to manually click another button or some such thing to signal the page that he is done saving the filep

You will notice when running top the php process that is sticking... this one when traced just loads a page, sleeps on a timer, loads another page...

I compile on that as a Win32 target, and it compiles fine, but when I run my new app on Win7 or Win8 both 64bit havent tried anything else, it always throws an error at this point. Whyp

At the beginning main routine, I add these URLs to a queue, then start x goroutines that work on these URLs.p  pIn special cases, the resource a URL points to may contain even more URLs which have to be added to the queue.

SoftReference might work, but then theres still a chance that our resource will be GCd before we can put it back in the available list.p  pSo heres the question strongIs there any way to keep track of whether these resources are still actually being usedstrongp  pIdeally, threads could claim resources, use them as long as they want, and those resources would be freed up automatically as soon as no more references are maintained.

Negative 58338 pstrongEDIT 2strong This entire question and exploration were based on my missing the fundamental notion of zippers that they represent a perspective in a datastructure from the point of view of a particular node. So a zipper is  at all times  a pair of the current node and what the rest of the tree looks like from the perspective of that node. I was originally trying to generate a whole new structure from the zipper, while the zipper itself was all I needed, all along. Ill leave this all up for posterity, in the hope that somebody else is helped by it or so it serves as a warning to any successors.p  pOriginal questionp  pIm trying to get my head around using zippers to manipulate trees. The specific problem is that I need to generate at runtime routes between two nodes matching arbitrary criteria in an arbitrary tree.p  pI thought I could use the codepathcode function to get a route to a location by calling codepathcode on the current location. But the path returned seems to omit the last steps required to get there.p  pFor examplep  precodedef testzip vectorzip [0 [1] [2 [3 [4] 5 [6 [7] [8]]]]] gt testzip      down right right down      right down right right     node codepre  pgives code5code, but p  precodegt testzip      down right right down      right down right right     path codepre  pgivesp  precode[[0 [1] [2 [3 [4] 5 [6 [7] [8]]]]] [2 [3 [4] 5 [6 [7] [8]]]] [3 [4] 5 [6 [7] [8]]]] codepre  pwhich isnt the same location its missing the effect of the last three steps, codedown right rightcode.p  pIt looks like the path function only gets you to the parent location in the tree, ignoring any siblings between you and the actual location.p  pAm I missing the point of the codepathcode function Id assumed that given a tree and a path, applying the path to the tree would bring you to the original location of the path, not partly there.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Ive used the following function definition to compile a path of nodes from a start location to an end locationp  precodedefn lcapath [startloc endloc]   let [sczip zroot startloc         startpath zpath startloc         startnode znode startloc         endpath zpath endloc         endnode znode endloc         lcapath filter set startpath endpath         lcanode [last lcapath]         lcatostart conj vec drop count lcapath startpath startnode         lcatoend conj vec drop count lcapath endpath endnode         ]      concat reverse lcatostart lcanode lcatoend    codepre  pPretty heavily influenced by the chat with Mark Fisher, thanksp
Negative 58338 pI am reading through the documentation and the following confuses me because it states at the top of the document with version 5 we get reliability without using the DTC.p  blockquote   pThese feature has been implemented using both the Outbox pattern and the Deduplication pattern. As a message is dequeued we check to see if we have previously processed it. If so, we then deliver any messages in the outbox for that message but do not invoke messageprocessing logic again. strongIf the message wasnt previously processed, then we invoke the regular handler logic, storing all outgoing message in a durable storage in the same transaction as the users own database changesstrong. Finally we send out all outgoing messages and update the deduplication storage.p blockquote  pIm sure its probably due to my lack of understanding, but wouldnt the fact that NServiceBus is opening its own connection and transaction separate from the message handler ex calling repository for saving database connection the transaction would be escalated to a full 2PC using the DTCp  pHere is the documentationp  pa hrefhttpdocs.particular.netnservicebusoutbox relnofollowhttpdocs.particular.netnservicebusoutboxap  pThanksp

Negative 58338 pI am looking for an alternative solution to using Sumproduct  Sumif  Sumifs basically, array formulas when it comes to the example provided below. I have scoured Stackoverflow and I am coming up woefully empty. I am open to anyandall suggestions to achieve better performance that do not involve changing out of Excel because that is the medium I have been ordered to do this in. Thank you in advanced for your timep  pMy problem is thus I have an excel workbook that takes 4090 seconds to calculate, depending on PC specs. I have narrowed the calculation problems to a series of array calculations. When these array calculations are removed, my workbook takes 3 seconds to fully recalculate... so yes I am sure these are the bottleneck.p  pMy array calculations are like so I have a list of zone names eg North America, Western Europe, etc... on Sheet 1, row 2, extending to column HJ. I have a list of values on Sheet 2 rows 2500, also extending to column HJ. I need to aggregatesumup all of the values on Sheet 2, based on the zone names on Sheet 1. The columns are in a direct 1to1 relationship, so the following formulae all work and create the exact same valuesp  precodeSUMPRODUCTSheet2A2Sheet2HJ2, Sheet1A2Sheet1HJ2  North America SUMIFSheet1A2Sheet1HJ2, North America, Sheet2A2Sheet2HJ2  SUMIFSSheet2A2Sheet2HJ2, Sheet1A2Sheet1HJ2, North America codepre  pThe performance of doing these array calculations is unacceptable to the powers that be. I am fairly certain that my response should be tough noogies, but I must do my due diligence on finding an alternative.p  pSo am I doing anything wrong with these array calculations Can I restructure them somehow I am fine with helper rows, UDFs, etc...p  pThanks againp

Negative 58338 pI have a nice C project, where template programming is used extensively, but that is really not the point. The point is that some of my class names with all the template parameters get quite long. I use Doxygen for documentation.p  pThis wouldnt normally be an issue but recently I noticed that the class list is unreadable because the long class names make it too wide to fit on a screen.p  pIs there a way to make Doxygen break names of classes in the class list to more lines Is there perhaps a way to hide specializations of a template class from class list while retaining the general template class Is there a better solutionp  pI managed to find a silly workaround by hiding the classes in a namespace and then immediately importing this namespace to the global namespace, so that the names of those classes would not appear on the list, unless the namespace is clicked or detail level is increased.

Negative 58338 pI know inheritance means is a relationship, and it can also have polymorphic behaviour. But for example, in Java, the difference between extending from a parent class and implementing an interface is that the interface has methods to be implemented only. They both need the child class to depend on the parent class and lead class to couple to each other.p  pSo, besides extending from parent class, should implementing interfaces to a class also be avoided if possiblep

Now the problem is the codesimilarity valuecode for codesummarycode becomes same for some of the strings in codelinecode. So the strings in codelinecode are sorted alphabetically. So if the highest value is same for some of the strings, the topvalue will have the highest value alphabetically whereas it may be most similar with lower strings.p  pSo I want to have most highest similar value in topvalue plus also the most similar string match also regardless the alphabetically sorted order.p  pFor example if codesummarycode is Software engineering in 2001  A case the matched values are given by these lines of code.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comdPZcB.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdPZcB.png altResults of scoring lines and summary matchesap  pAs it can be seen from image attached that string to be matched contains strings codeSoftware Engineering.........code where I got codeengineering designcode in the highest codetopvaluecode whereas it should be codesoftware engineeringcode.

Negative 58338 pIm studying IOSSwift development and Id like to build an IOS app that in the future will have its own Today Extension. Ive read that it is better to put the common logic for example the logic that accesses Internet resources, performs some job on the result etc between the App and its extension into a Custom Framework.. Since I think Ill need to change both Framework and App code during the development of the App, Id like to avoid building the framework in a separate project, than use Show In Finder function to locate the framework bundle and then draganddropping it within the App project.. So Id like to know if this is the correct way to set up a Workspace with an App, the framework it uses and the Today Extension of the Appp  ol liemCreate a new Project with an IOS App targetemli liemSelect the project in the Project Navigatorem and then emEditorAdd Target...em and specify a emCocoa Touch Frameworkemli liemEditorAdd Target...em and specify emToday Extensionemli liemAdd the framework in Linked Frameworks and Librariesemli ol  pIn this way Ive seen that changes to the Framework sources do not need a Framework target recompilation, maybe because the project knows about the need to recompile framework sources even if I only build amp run the IOS App target that uses that framework Am I doing it right Ive seen that the Today Extension created in such way does not lists the framework in the emBuild Phases  Target Dependenciesem while the IOS App does, but both of them correctly use the updated code of the Framework when I update it.p  pThen, Ive noticed the following warning when I compile the project, but I dont know if it is related to the way Ive setup the projectp  precodeld warning linking against dylib not safe for use in application extensions UsersgianniLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataTestFrameworkAppdshihhfiuepeqzddbnpgnfwilhemBuildProductsDebugiphonesimulatorTestFramework.frameworkTestFramework codepre  pBTW is it normal that the entries within the emProductsem folder are always red Is it due to the fact that I build only for IOS Simulator since I dont have a Paid developer account that allows me to build for an IOS Device Does this prevent me to build a framework that can be exported for some other Project since I cant find the Framework bundle with a right clicking on the framework product and selecting emShow In Finderem and so I cant draganddrop it to another projectp  pI hope Ive been clear enough and that youll point me in the right direction to understand what is the suggested way of starting my new project p

Negative 58338 pAlright, so. This is driving me absolutely insane. Im building an application in Java and it requires that the keyboard keys be simulated. Like, I want to fool the entire computer into thinking a key is being pressed. Dont worry, my intentions are not malicious P  The problem is, I was using Javas Robot class to simulate the key presses, and there is a bug that doesnt allow for the arrow keys to be pressed in some applications, for whatever reason.p  pSo I figured I would just make a small C program to handle the input simulation and call it from Java. But heres the kicker The arrow keys emstillem do not work for some programs. Like, it just doesnt register. They are the same programs that didnt work for Java, as far as I can tell.p  pIs there any way at all to simulate arrow key presses throughout all programs, 100 of the time Im open to any language at this point.p  pHeres the C program I have so far, if it matters.p  precodedefine WINVER 0x0500 include ltwindows.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltcstringgt  int main      INPUT ip      Sleep2000      ip.type  INPUTKEYBOARD     ip.ki.wScan  0     ip.ki.time  0     ip.ki.dwExtraInfo  0      ip.ki.wVk  VKRIGHT     ip.ki.dwFlags  0     SendInput1, ampip, sizeofINPUT      Sleep1000      ip.ki.dwFlags  KEYEVENTFKEYUP     SendInput1, ampip, sizeofINPUT      return 0  codepre  pI really hope somebody can help me, because I am out of ideas.p

Negative 58338 pMy first question here. I have a script with 2 arrays of objects where 1 property from object1 match 1 property from object 2. When the properties match, object1 gets a new property based on a property in object2. The range of properties can be around 520 different ones and the array holding object1 can easily contain 100 objects so if there is a better way to do it other than double loops that would be great, but i am still new to handlingcomparing objects in this way.p  pSo far i have this but it doesnt seem to work.p  precodeforeach vm in vms    foreach csv in csvs      if vm.location eq csv.ownerNode     vm  vm  AddMember MemberType NoteProperty Name csv Value csv.name         codepre  pemedit for more background, also posted further downem The reason i chose to use objects is that i need to add more and more properties as the scrip runs, then at the end use them around 45 properties per object to sort them and then do different actions based on the different properties.p
Negative 58338 pIm trying to get the hang of javascript inheritance for multilevel inheritance frameworks. Basically what Ive built is an abstract utility class that contains generic functions I can use in all other classes including stuff like a selfcontained simple set of ajax restful methods.p  pBelow that I have generic abstract classes to define core functions to key types of classes that will fall under each. One of my types for example, includes a collection of one of the other types. Im trying to write some javascript classes to emulate doctrine entities and entity collectionsp  pOne of the things I tried to do, since all collections will have an associative array with the primaryIdkey and the entity object value, was that I put the definition for the actual list of entities in the abstract layer. But I quickly found out that when I created more than one collection of the same type, any new ones I created had that property already populated with the values from the most recently populated prior one.p  pBarebones examplep  precodemyUtil  function      this.prop1  some value   myUtil.prototype.setVals  functiondata,child      child.populatedata   myInter  function      this.vals  zz   myInter.prototype  new myUtil myInter.prototype.populate  functiondata      fori in data          this.vals[i]  data[i]        myClass  functiondata       this.vals       this.vals[0]  0      this.setVals  functiondata           do other stuff specific to inherited class         myInter.prototype.setValsdata, this            if data was passed in when instantiated, set values     iftypeofdata  object          this.setValsdata       myClass.prototype  new myInter  var foo  new myClassaa,bb,cc var bar  new myClass bar.setVals11, 22, 33  console.logfoofoo,barbar codepre  pSo in this example both object instances would end up with aa, bb, cc, zz, 00, 11, 22, 33 for their vals property. If I uncomment the local initial setting of this.vals   in the child levels, each will have the values I set to it plus the 00 but not the zz.p  pFirst, am I doing this the right way or is there a better way to write this out so the values property cascade down and each child has a unique set of the properties when you make a new onep  pI can probably get by for now with declaring and modifying all at the child level, but in other languages, Ive done some things with initializing part of a propertys dataset in one level and filling in the remainder in the specific child classes. Is there a way to do something like this in js or do I have to split out the data even further and write in specific initialization methodscode to grab parent level data each timep

Whenever the window is on the Thunderbolt Display, the controls pop back into 2x mode, and when the window is on the Retina MacBooks display, they pop back to original size. How do I ensure they scale on retina displays Using transform scale4 doesnt do anything it isnt a matter of retina displays requiring 2x the scale factor.p  pNote I tested in Chrome 44 and Safari 8.0.7 and the behavior occurs in both, thus my titling the question WebKit. Interestingly, using zoom 200 instead of transform scale2 causes Chrome to render the boxes in a different style that bypasses this issue, but that doesnt work in Safari, where it exhibits the same behavior described above. I have tested this on multiple Retina MacBook Pros and they all exhibit this behavior, so it is not an issue local to my machine.p  pstrongEDITstrong I modified the fiddle to include a codeltbuttongtcode element as well, and same thing occurs, so this is not limited to radios and checkbox inputs.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong I tested codeltimggtcode elements and they scale properly. As a result I dont think this is an issue for all elements, just specific ones, and I have found that it impacts radio buttons, checkboxes, and buttons so far.p

Negative 58338 pIm using the Jenkins DSL plugin to automatically create build jobs for all branches of a git project. The DSL plugin is triggered by web hooks so that it is run immediately after a new branch was created. The generated build jobs for each branch are also configured to be triggered by web hooks.p  pThe problem with the current setup is, that the build will only be executed after the second commit. The first commit will trigger the Jenkins DSL plugin to create the respective Jenkins Job and the second commit will then trigger the newly created job.p  pIs there any way, to start a Jenkins job immediately after it has been created by the DSL plugin The only thing I can currently come up with is to add an additional build scheduling but Id rather like to use web hooks only to prevent unnecessary polling.p

Negative 58338 pI am using a system.timer in a Windows Service to run a process that usually exceeds the timers interval.  I am trying to keep the timer from firing the same code more than once, a known issue with system.timers.p  pWhat I want  The timer runs my code, but the timer pauses to wait until the code is completed before resuming ticks.p  pI have two problemsp  ol lipThe way system.timers work is that the timer will create a race condition on you by launching new redundant threads of the same code and pile them up on you if the has not completed by the time the timers interval has elapsed.pli lipI would startstop the timer to keep this from happening, but with a System.Timers.Timer, once you stop the timer for the processing to complete, it never comes back  I have never been able to restart a timer once it has been stopped, it has been destroyed and likely collected.  Enablingdisabling is the same exact thing as startstop with same results.pli ol  pHow on earth do you keep a system.timer from launching new redundant threads of the same code if the process has not completed by the time the timers interval has lapsed  Obviously, startingstopping enablingdisabling the timer is NOT a solution, as it doesnt work.p  pHelpp

Negative 58338 pWe are building a web application with aggressive performance SLAs which are periodically being violated due to the JVM going out to lunch due to System.gc calls. Weve done some debugging, and determined that in all cases its the internal app server code which is invoking System.gc. This occurs a few times while the app server is booting or the application is deployed, which we arent concerned about. However, System.gc is also periodically be triggered when the app is up and running via internal app server calls the NIO classes.

I havent been able to find a direct reference as to why the System.gc calls in NIO are actually necessary, and there isnt a code comment specifically addressing it where it occurs in JDK code, either a hrefhttphg.openjdk.java.netjdk8ujdk8udevjdkfile4a1e42601d61srcshareclassesjavanioBits.java relnofollowhttphg.openjdk.java.netjdk8ujdk8udevjdkfile4a1e42601d61srcshareclassesjavanioBits.javaap  pIf its a bad idea to completely disable System.gc due to the use of NIO, is there at least something we can do to reduce the frequency at which its called It appears that we can set XXMaxDirectMemorySize, but this appears as if it would only set up upper bound on the amount of allocated memory, and would just as likely have an adverse affect.p
