Positive 1903 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pIm working on an application using an entity component system.  The system relies heavily on two abstract classes, Component and Processor, which share a one to one relationship.  Each Processor implements a basic Subscriber interface allowing the EventManager class to notify them when a new Event is created.p  pstrongEventsstrongp  pI have an Event abstract class which stores event type ID, like sop  precodepublic abstract class Event       public static final int NONE  0      private final int eventID      public Eventint eventID          this.eventID  eventID           public int getEventID          return eventID       codepre  pThen I have a Factory type class that extends Event, like sop  precodepublic abstract class BaseEvents extends Event       public static final int TRANSFORM  1      public BaseEventsint eventID          supereventID           public static class Transform extends BaseEvents           private final float rotation,                 tx,                 ty          public Transformfloat rotation, float tx, float ty              superTRANSFORM             this.rotation  rotation             this.tx  tx             this.ty  ty                   public float getRotation              return rotation                   public float getTx              return tx                   public float getTy          return ty                codepre  pIm trying to allow the ability to create new events simply by further extending BaseEvents.  Im using static inner classes mostly for organization. I dont want to create a separate class for every event.p  pstrongEvent Handlersstrongp  pTo avoid hardcoding handling of each Event in a given Processor Im using an EventHandler class.  My plan was to have one EventHandler class per Event.  Again Im using static inner classes for organization.p  pHeres the EventHandler abstract classp  precodepublic abstract class EventHandler       public void handleEvent event, Component component        codepre  pHeres the BaseEventHandlers Factory classp  precodepublic class BaseEventHandlers extends EventHandler       public static class Transform extends BaseEventHandlers           Override         public void handleEvent event, Component component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             RenderComponent c  RenderComponent component             c.setRotatione.getRotation             c.setTxe.getTx             c.setTye.getTy                codepre  pThe example code Im showing is for a RenderComponent  RenderProcessor pairing.  We care about Transform events because they tell us where to repaint an object.p  pWhen EventManager notifies RenderProcessor of a new event, we check a Map using the Event ID to obtain the appropriate EventHandler, invoking its handle method. Note, Events are actually stored in a Processors queue and processed during an update call, like sop  precode... protected final MapltInteger, EventHandlergt eventHandlers  new HashMapltgt ...     Override     public void update          events.stream                 .forEachevent gt                      eventHandlers.getevent.getEventID.handleevent, components.getevent.getSourceEntityID                          events.clear      ... codepre  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pIn the EventHandler, I need to cast both the Event and the Component abstract classes into appropriate concrete classes.  Im OK with being limited to one type of Event, but I cant limit myself to one type of Component.  What I want is to use Polymorphism and Overloading so that I have something likep  precode    ...         public void handleEvent event, RenderComponent component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             component.setRotatione.getRotation             component.setTxe.getTx             component.setTye.getTy                   public void handleEvent event, OtherComponent component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             component.setRotatione.getRotation             component.setTxe.getTx             component.setTye.getTy              ... codepre  pThis wont work because I only have access to the handleEvent event, Component component method of the abstract class overloading doesnt seem to care about the subclass.  One idea was to create an interface like Transformable and have RenderComponent and OtherComponent implement it.  This works when the data contained in the event is applicable to both Components, but it would be very easy for that not to be the case with some Events.  p  pFor example, say I have an event for closing a window called WindowClosed.  I need to play a sound, draw a closing animation, and update the number of open windows.  Thats one event three different ComponentsProcessors need to process.  In this example, the only interface that would work would be one that covered all methods needed by each Component, which in my opinion leads to messy, messy spaghetti code.p  pIs there perhaps a clever way to solve this using Genericsp

Positive 1903 pIm using Lua for scripts in my C game.  I want to be able to attach scripts to entities, and based on which functions are defined in the script, register for callbacks which will run the script functions at the appropriate time.p  pI believe that I can encapsulate different scripts from each other, by making the script into a table.  Basically, code... lua source code ...code would become codeScriptName   ... lua source code ... code.  Then instead of calling codefunccode, Id call codeScriptName.funccode, and thus two scripts defining the same function aka registering for the same event wouldnt trample over each other.p  pMy problem now is in encapsulating different entities sharing the same script.  Obviously I dont want them to be sharing variables, but with what Im doing now, any variable defined by a script would be shared by every instance of that script, which is just really bad.  I could maybe try something similar to my above solution on the source level, by wrapping every script with codeEntityID.ScriptName   ... code before compiling it.  Something tells me theres a better way, though, I just dont know it.p  pAnother factor is that scripts need to be able to reference entities and scriptscomponents relative to a specific entity.  If I use the above method the best solution to this would be passing entity IDs around as strings which could reference the table specific to that entity, I think  At this point I really have no idea what Im doing.p

Positive 1903 pstrongTLDRstrong How do I tell doctrines entity manager that it doesnt need to persist entities that have been recovered from cachep  pIve recently been looking to make some optimizations in a code base and noticed that our object for describing the logged in user was proving costly to query and hydrate. It is comprises of a small number of doctrine entities. p  pGiven that the user details change rarely and we can easily identify when this happens, it makes sense to me to cache this object for the duration of the users logged in session invalidating it when any of the entities are updated by the user. p  pI made use of the Filesystem Cache driver that we use for caching of doctrines meta data. So far so good.p  pUntil of course the user tries to do something that requires saving. When we record the users action, we use one of the users entities as a property to relate that action to the user. p  pDoctrine reports with an codeORMInvalidArgumentExceptioncode that codeA new entity was found through the relationship entity... that was not configured to cascade persist operations for entity ...codep  pIt looks like as entities are queried using doctrine, the entity manager keeps track of these such that when a save happens, it knows what entities are new and which require persisting. By recovering our user object from cache, we bypass this operation. When a user entity is used, it looks to the entity manager that it is new and thus requires persisting but the relationship isnt set to persist, and even if it was, it would fail miserably. p  pMoving forward I see two possible optionsp  ol liWhen ever we make use of a users entity, instead of passing the actual entity, we pass a doctrine reference instead. This should be simple to put in place but requires all developers to be aware of this so has a risk of future problems.li liWhen we recover the user from cache, somehow tell the entity manager that these entities already exist and dont require persisting. Ive tracked this down to the codeUnitOfWorkcodes codeentityStatescode property but its marked as private.li ol  pI personally prefer option 2 but I have no idea how to do this. Are there any other options that Ive overlookedp

Negative 1903 pI was trying to contact the author of a book I am reading on SQL Server query performance, but it seems the email address provided in the book does not exis any more. So I decided to ask the community. I am pasting the messasge I had written below. Thanks in advance.p  pp  pI have bought your book SQL Server 2008 Query Performance Tuning Distilled and got to know that my SQL Server Express Edition wont support many of the important tools I will need in order to run the necessary performance tests. As you have said, it is important to have an initial analisys to check how much queries are hurting database performance. Since I dont have profiler, I cannot know. I have downloaded a free project tool, but I am afraid I am not getting the information I need. And it seems to me, the information that should be shown when using SET STATISTICS wont appear in SQL Server Express either.p  pWhich is the lowest version of SQL Server that will offer me the tools to run the tests suggested in the book Is it Developer Edition Does it offer everything I need in order to follow the examplesp  pAlso, is there any problem to install the new version like Developer Edition on top of Express Edition Or do I have to uninstall the previous versionp  pI hope I am not bothering much. I would also like to congratulate you on the great book on such an important topic.p

For similar reasons, I never really invested in downloadinglearning software to help me program IDEs, editors, compilers, etc. p  pI know it sounds tedious, but my current setup is notepad for coding Filezilla to transfer .cpp amp .h files to schools aludraunix and compiling unix tells me where my bugs are and I go back to notepad to debug repeat until done. p  pThis isnt fun  and I know it could be easier. But I put it off knowing that I was soon going to switch to a Mac. And, tomorrow, Im switching.p  pSo...p  ul liHow should I set up my Macbook for the best programming experience li liWhat IDEs and editors and debuggers and so on should I download li liHow will Mac programming differ from PCli ul  pIm open to all ideas and comments, even the most basic.p  pemBackground  Im learningprogramming in C right now. Next semester, my classes switch to Java. Im also going to take a class in web development, with HTMLCSSJavascriptPHP. My new laptop will be a late 2009 Macbook Pro with Leopard, or maybe Snow Leopard. Free would be preferrable for all programs.emp  pThank you all.p
Negative 1903 pI am embedding tracking images within emails that are being sent from a custombuilt optin CRM system.  The image src is an encoded .gif, such as src1234675.gif.  The image is served by an ASP.NET httphandler that decodes the src encoding and serves a transparent image.p  pEverything works fine, but some email clients request the image multiple times, creating duplicate entries.  Some clients make three calls all within one second, and some seem to make tens of calls over a day or so.  Mostly email clients make single calls, but these few duplicates are very perplexing.  I know I can code around them, but Id really like to understand whats going on.p  pIve checked the IIS log files, which show that the duplicate requests are coming from the client machines.

Negative 1903 pI have been looking all over the Web for a way to plot an ellipse from rectangle coordinates, that is, topleft corner x, y and size width and height. The only ones I can find everywhere are based on the MidpointBresenham algorithm and I cant use that because when working with integer pixels, I lose precisions because these algorithms use a center point and radials.p  pThe ellipse MUST be limited to the rectangles coordinates, so if I feed it a rectangle where the width and height are 4 or any even number, I should get an ellipse that completely fits in a 4x4 rectangle, and not one that will be 5x5 like what those algorithms are giving me.p  pDoes anyone know of any way to accomplish thisp  pThanksp

Negative 1903 pI created a codeJFramecode initialized with a codeBorderLayoutcode and a codeJScrollPanecode as its codeCENTERcode element.p  pThe scroll pane is set with codeVERTICALSCROLLBARALWAYScode and codeHORIZONTALSCROLLBARNEVERcode policies.

But instead, there is only a single line displayed with no wrapping... ever.p  pDoes anyone know why the codeflow layoutcode does not wrap when a codescroll panecode is involvedp  pIf I remove the codescroll panecode all together and put the codecontent panelcode directly in the codeframecode, the desired wrapping effect occurs, but if the codeframecode height is shrunk smaller than the codecontent panelcode height it just disappears. p  pThe idea is that I want my codelabelscode to be wrapped when necessary but also always be visible if it means having to scroll updown.p  pAny suggestions on how to fix thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 1903 pI am using modules in flex , to build different parts of my webapp. What I need now, is a way these modules can communicate with each other on events.p  pWhat really is happening is ,that there is a central module, which then will take care of loading other modules and passing data to and fro. But , coding for each part to delegate events to each of these loaded modules from the central module and back would be  a big nightmare.p  pWhat I really want to do is have a global event bus for it. Are there any specific libraries , already existing for such a process. Also, I would be using MVC , so it should also take care between events form the model to the view and viceaversa.p

Negative 1903 pIm working my way through Accelerated C and have decided to mess around with the one of structs that were defined in there. While doing so, Ive come across a problem creating a vector of these structs and modifying the elements in each one seems to modify the elements in all of them.p  pI realize that this probably means Ive initialized all the structs in the vector to a struct at a single memory address, but I used the .pushback method to insert dummy structs in to the vector.

Negative 1903 pI have a multipage form with many dropdown select boxes. Most of those boxes need to have an Other field and then a way to enter content that is not one of the select values. When the form is submitted, if Other is selected, the other content should be saved into the database in place of the dropdown menu.p  pIs there a plugin or script that has already been written that can do this for me easily A lot of my fields are created dynamically and must be edited later on using a nested form jquery plugin so writing code that applies to all of them without writing a specific function for each field has been tough for me.p  pIf I cant find a suitable plugin I will probably use the a hrefhttpdojotoolkit.orgreferenceguidedijitformComboBox.htmldijitformcombobox relnofollowDojo dijit Comboboxa, and while that accomplishes exactly what I am looking for, the ideal for my users would be a select box plugin that has an Other option in the dropdown, and when Other is selected a text box would appear for users to fill out. When the field is being edited, it would also need to populate the dropdown or textbox appropriately based on the value stored in the database. Does something like this exist, either in javascriptjqueryprototypeother, or a rails 3 plugin or gem Thanks so muchp  pEdit I will most likely use a hrefhttpflexbox.codeplex.com relnofollowFlexBoxa if I cant find something with a separate text area  but Im still looking for a separatetextarea solutionp

I have a program on my computer, that I have no control over. I dont have its source, there is not way to modify the source, and I cant use injection techniques to tell it to do something different. And of course, it uses UDP to connect with a server, and i NEED that to work.p  pNow, I need to get that program working, however I am behind a secure network, that does not allow UDP traffic dont ask. I need to create a network driver that captures all of the UDP traffic generated by ALL the programs on my computer, send it to a dedicated server in which i would have coded a server daemon to translate the TCP to UDP and send it to the original destination.p

Negative 1903 pIm writing an app that manages documents for a user and eventually posts PDF files served out through a web service on the iPhoneiPad. These are almost exclusively scanned PDF files, and they appear to REALLLLLY bog down the iOS device.p  pThe first solution I came up with was to simply host the PDF in a UIWebView. This works really, really well for generated PDF files, but NOT for scanned PDF files Im guessing the difference here is raster vs. vector. p  pMy next solution was to implement a UIDocumentInteractionController, which was said to increase snappiness. I can report that it does, indeed, seem to be faster than UIWebView, but its still unacceptably slow, even on smallish, 2 page PDF files. On a side note, the autoopeninanotherapp feature, along with builtin printing is super slickp  pIve read a post or 2 about the QuickLook framework, and I plan to look into that, but Ive also stumbled across a few posts talking about CGPDFDocument classes and such. Those seem to have a finer control over document navigation a la xPdf, but I have no idea where to start with that. Plus, Im not even sure if it offers a performance benefit for what Im doing.p  pSo, first question whats the fastest way to render scanned PDF files on the iPhoneiPadp  pSecond question The scanned PDF files are generated by my company, so I have some control over the PDF generation settings.

Negative 1903 pThis is a bit of a followup to my last question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6522541canvasisdrawingtooslowlyCanvas is drawing too slowlyap  pNow that I can draw images more quickly, the problem I am faced with is that the actual loading of the images takes far too long.p  pIn the app I am working on, the user is able to play back video frames jpegs in succession, as though he is viewing the video in realtime. I have been using codeBitmapFactory.decodeFilecode to load each jpeg in a Bitmap. Im unable to load all images at once since there are about 240 of them, and that would use up all of my heap space. What I have been doing is preloading up to 6 at a time into an array by way of a separate thread in order to cut down on the time it takes for each image to display.p  pUnfortunately, it takes somewhere between 50 and 90ms to load an image, and I need to show an image every 42ms. Is there a faster way to load images possiblyp  pFor clarification, these images are in a folder on the SD card, and they are all 720x480 jpegs. I am sampling them at half that size to cut down on memory usage.p

Negative 1903 pIm using the code from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms131056.aspxthis MSDN pagea to create a user defined aggregate to concatenate strings with codegroup byscode in SQL server. One of my requirements is that the order of the concatenated values are the same as in the query. For examplep  precodeValue   Group 1       1 2       1 3       2 4       2 codepre  pUsing queryp  precodeSELECT   dbo.Concattbl.Value As Concat,   tbl.Group FROM   SELECT TOP 1000      tblTest.   FROM      tblTest   ORDER BY      tblTest.Value As tbl GROUP BY   tbl.Group codepre  pWould result inp  precodeConcat  Group 1,2   1 3,4   2 codepre  pThe result seems to always come out correct and as expected, but than I came across a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.sqlserver.server.sqluserdefinedaggregateattribute.isinvarianttoorder.aspxthis pagea that states that the order is not guaranteed and that attribute codeSqlUserDefinedAggregateAttribute.IsInvariantToOrdercode is only reserved for future use.p  pSo my question is Is it correct to assume that the concatenated values in the string can end up in any order brIf that is the case then why does the example code on the MSDN page use the codeIsInvariantToOrdercode attributep
Negative 1903 pIs there a MVC 3 helper that could compress and include linked JavaScript  CSS in the original HTML sent from the server so the client wouldnt have to go get it as a separate requestp  pWe started storing linked images in the cloud while our ASP.NET code is locally hosted.  It allows 100 times the requests but subsequent requests take forever.  p  pWe need the first html request to include everything rather than several call backs to the server.  I thought if something existed to identifycompressdotfuscate JavaScriptCSS in the original HTML sent to the client, it would be much more efficient.  It could be cached too.p

Negative 1903 pIs it possible to create, in Scala, a type which is parametrized by a value Instead of defining a partial type codeList[A]code and parametrize it with codeList[Int]code, Id like to define a partial type in pseudocode codeElement[Symbol]code and parametrize it with codeElement[td]code. In this example, the type represent an XML element codeElement[td]code informs the Scala type checker that we have a codelttdgtcode element, and you can imagine that one could have APIs that specifically expect or return codelttdgtcode elements.p  pSubclassing, as incodeclass Td extends Elementcode, is not a very satisfactory solution, as it doesnt prevent two pieces of code, maybe written by independent developers, from declaring different subclasses for codelttdgtcode, which will then be considered to be different types by the Scala type checker.p

Negative 1903 pthis one is really puzzling me, so thanks for any help. I am trying to output the values of a SQL result set, but the foreach loop appears to be iterating twice, then incrementing the array index. Such that if my DB row holds the contiguous integers 1,2,3,4,5 the output of the foreach loop is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5. Cant see the reason. Code follows.  p  precoderesult  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM Test  echo lttable border1gtlttrgtlttrgt  Whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresult      echo lttrgt     foreachrow as value              echo lttdgt . value . lttdgt          echo lttrgtlttrgt     forx0xlt5x              echo lttdgt . row[x] . lttdgt          echo lttrgt  codepre  pThe second for loop was thrown in afterwards for debugging, to make sure the array didnt actually contain two instances of each value. But that loop outputs as expected 1,2,3,4,5. Any Ideas Thanks.p

This thing has been up and running for two weeks now, so our database is growing Number of log tables    411  Number of log entries   48,000,513 Approx. size of tables 37.32 GBp  pEvery hour a different logtable is created with over 100.000 entries every time, thats why we have 411 at the moment.p  pI also created a search interface for it, using an index table which contains table names, the first and the last entry in the table, so that when specifying a date for the search, things run quite smooth.p  pHowever when I search for e.g. site X without specifying a date range, over 400 tables have to be searched, and every row contains a large XML message, so things are getting slower every day.p  pI started looking for more advanced search solutions and found them with Sphinx and Solr, BUT I just cant seem to get things rightp  ul liI cant find how to set up those engines to search across all tables they all have the same structure.

Negative 1903 pPlease refer to the following fiddle a hrefhttpwww.senchafiddle.comxXQlp relnofollowhttpwww.senchafiddle.comxXQlpa Be sure to have your console open to see the output that shows the incorrect data.p  pHere you can see Im creating 2 Student models, each of which have a list of 0 Award models.  Dave has been given 2 rather nice awards  unsurprisingly   whereas Chaz has added 2 notsogreat awards.  The problem is that the logging shows that infact Chaz ends up with 4 awards the 2 good ones, as well as the 2 bad ones.p  pThis fiddle is a severe boiling down of a much larger app, but I have isolated this as the origin of a huge problem Ive been having  Ive even found a fix for it.  If you uncomment lines 55 and 56 from the fiddle and run it again be sure to clear your localstorage, you will see that Chaz only has to 2 awards that he should.p  pFor reasons that I hope are obvious, this is not a fix Im happy with.  There has to be something else Im doing wrong with the association to cause Chaz to get all 4 awards.  ... surelyp  pCheersp  pUPDATE Answer below accepted, removing autoLoadtrue fixes the problem.  I want autoLoad however, so I implemented the following in the init of the Student model p  precodefor var i0, lthis.associations.all.length iltl i      var assoc  this.associations.all[i]     if assoc.type  hasmany          var assocName  assoc.name         var getterName  get  assocName.charAt0.toUpperCase  assocName.slice1         this[getterName]  functionassocName              var self  this             return function                  var store  self[assocName]                 if store.isLoaded                      store.load                                  return store                      .callthis, assocName       codepre  pThis adds a getter for each hasMany association that the student has, and ensures that the store for that association is loaded before returning it.  ie I can now access student1s awards with student1.getAwards rather than student1.awards, and know that the awards will have been loaded, this will automatically work for any other hasMany associations I add to the model.  p  pI hope this is helpful to some readers.p

Negative 1903 pSo, heres the deal.  My current usecase is in C, but Im also interested in the general algorithmic case I am given two Arrays of objects I dont get to alter the code that creates these arrays, unfortunately. Each object has as part of it a .Name property, a string. These strings are unique per object, and they have zero or one matching strings in the other object. What I need to do is efficiently pair these objects based on that string, into some sort of collection that allows me access to the paired objects.  The strings need to match exactly to be considered a match, so I dont need any Upper or CaseInsensitive, etc. Sadly, these lists are not sorted. The lists themselves are maybe 3050 items, but I need to repeat the algorithm on thousands of these arraypairs in a row, so efficiency is important.p  pSince I know that theres 0 or 1 match, and I know that most of them will be 1 match, I feel like theres a more efficient algorithm than xy Foreach item in x, foreach item in y, if xy then x and y are a matchp  pI believe the most likely options are p  pKeep the unsorted list and just do xy, but drop items from the list once Ive found them so I dont check ones alreadyfound,  OR Convert both to Dictionaries and then do an indexed lookup on each array2[currentArray1Item] OR Sort the lists myself Array.Sort, and then having sorted arrays I can probably do something clever like jump to the index in B where Id expect to find it wherever it was in A and then move up or down based on string until I either find it or pass where it shouldve been.p  pThen once thats done I need to figure out how to store it, I suppose I can make a custom ObjectPair class that just holds objects A and B.  No need to do anything fancy here, since Im just going to ForEach on the pairs.p  pSo the questions are  Are any of the above algorithms the fastest way to do this if not, what is and is there some existing C structure thatd conveniently hold the found pairsp  pstrongEDITstrong Array.Sort is a method that exists, so I dont need to convert the array to List to sort. Good to know. Updated above.p

Negative 1903 pIm developing a MacOS application. Since Mountain Lion 10.8 it is possible to add Game Center to OS X applications. Ive added one, tested it, and it works fine, but only in windowed mode. If I go fullscreen with my app, I can no longer see Game Center windows authentication window nor match finding. What can be the problem Im using SDL and OpenGL. I know that SDL uses Cocoa to set up the applications window. Game Center for OS X uses GKDialogController to show and dismiss windows, but there isnt much to tweak there. One thing that came to my mind was setting parent window as followsp  precodeself.dialogController.parentWindow  [NSApp mainWindow] codepre  pBut nothing changed. There is a brief pause when i access the Game Center, so it seems everything is working ok in fullscreen, just the window is not shown.

Negative 1903 pAll the documentation seems to suggest that setting the RenderTransform isnt supposed to impact arrange.  But thats not exactly the behavior Im seeing.p  pI have an odd requirement for a control layout.  I wanted to leave as much of wpfs layout system as I could, so I created an element that inherits Decorator.I have an attached property that marks the elements Im interested in.  During arrange, I call the base ArrangeOverride method, which layouts out the elements using the normal process.  Next, I crawl through the controls with the attached attribute and, using the render transform, I reposition the controls where I want them.p  pAll of this works fine, until I use an items control.  Assigning the RenderTransform is causing the arrange to be invalidated and my arrange method is being called repeatedly.  The documentation seems to suggest setting the RenderTransform has no impact on Arrange.p

Negative 1903 pI consume a web service that has a numeric element. The Delphi wsdl importer sets it up as Int64.p  pThe web service allows this element to be blank.

Negative 1903 pIm having difficulties testing python functions that return an iterable, like functions that are yielding or functions that simply return an iterable, like codereturn imapf, someitercode or codereturn permutations[1,2,3]code.p  pSo with the permutations example, I expect the output of the function to be code[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, ...]code. So, I start testing my code.p  precodedef perm3   return permutations[1,2,3]   Lets ignore test framework and such details def testperm3   assertEqualperm3, [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, ...] codepre  pThis will not work, since codeperm3code is an iterable, not a list. So we can fix this particular example.p  precodedef testperm3   assertEquallistperm3, [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, ...] codepre  pAnd this works fine. But what if I have nested iterables That is iterables yielding iterables Like say the expressions codeproductpermutations[1, 2], permutations[3, 4]code. Now this is probably not useful but its clear that it will be once unrolling the iterators something like code[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 3, ...]code. However, we can not just wrap codelistcode around our result, as that will only turn codeiterableltblahgtcode to code[iterableltblahgt, iterableltblahgt, ...]code. Well of course I can do codemaplist, product...code, but this only works for a nesting level of 2.p  pSo, does the python testing community have any solution for the problems when testing iterables Naturally some iterables cant be tested in this way, like if you want an infinite generator, but still this issue should be common enough for somebody to have thought about this.p

Negative 1903 pContext a program written in VB.NET, developedmaintained in VisualStudio2012, targeting framework v3.5.p  pA few years ago, the program was in VB6 and we translated it to VB.NET. As a result of the transformation, which was mostly automated, we still have quite a few places in the code where formatting of doubles and dates... for textual presentation is processed as inp  precodeDim sValue As String  Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.VB6.FormatdblValue, 0.00 codepre  pConversely, when we need to extract a Double value from such a string, we use p  precodeDim dblValue As Double  CDblsValue codepre  pCDbl listens to the System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture of the applications Thread, and this does NOT change when  during the run of the code  you change the Regional Settings through the Control Panel.p  pHowever, the VB6.Format as executed in the code starts out conforming to the currentCulture of the application as you might expect, BUT apparently I didnt know this, but accidentally found out listens to CHANGES in the Regional Settings and responds immediately to any changes you make there during the program execution. This implies that the CDbl and VB6.Format become mutually inconsistent.p  pOf course, changing the Regional Settings during program execution is awkward, and moreover, if you wish to support it, you can manage it by catching the SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged and Changing events and act upon their occurrences.p  pHowever, the different behaviour of VB6.FORMAT versus normal casts as CDblsomeString regarding changes in the CultureRegional Settings, strikes me as undesirable. Preferably you would have VB6.Format to comply ALWAYS with the applicationthreadCurrentCulture, and you may THEN choose how you want your code to respond to userpreference changes. Furthermore, Id like to gain some more insight in the issue.p  pMy question, therefore, is Is there a way to compilearrange... things such that the Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.VB6.Format listens to the applicationCurrentCulture and NOT respond  without our consent  to changes in Regional Settingsp  pAdditional information The program is compiled with  for the visualbasic stuff  a reference in the project VisualStudio2012 to CWindowsMicrosoft.NetFrameworkV2.0.50727Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.dll and ...Data.dll.p  pAny educational information or suggestion is welcome. The issue is not causing any real problems in our program, but I feel that we shouldmight have a better understanding and maybe even methods to make things more robust.p

Negative 1903 pIm developing a game in Unity using C. A part of the code, using a boolean, decides if the player is allowed to buy an upgrade for a building or not. If he is, the integer of the building is increased by 1. Next to that, the boolean gets set to false. If he isnt, nothing happens at the moment.p  pThere is a button in game, functionally increasing the week number by 1, allowing the player again to be able to upgrade building thus setting the boolean true again. p  pThe problem is that after buying the upgrade, the boolean is set to false, and even when I set it back to true again, when I try to upgrade the building, the boolean appears to be false. I also tried to check it with the help of an integer instead of a boolean using the values 0 and 1, but the problem is still here.p  pHere is some codep  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections using System.Collections.Generic  public class ActivateTrigger  MonoBehaviour      public int transtech  0     public int factech  0     public bool facmag  true     public bool transmag  true      void OnGUI  GUI.Boxnew Rect0, Screen.height  120  60, 150, 30, Week   week.ToString     if GUI.Buttonnew Rect0, Screen.height  120  30, 150, 20, Continue one week                     NextProcess          if GUI.Buttonnew Rect20, 70, 120, 20, Koop upgrade                   Debug.LogFacmag   facmag         if facmag  true                      facmag  false                        void NextProcess              Debug.LogNext process called         facmag  true         transmag  true         Debug.LogFacmag   facmag       codepre  pSo, when NextProcess is called, the Debug Log shows the value being true. But after the first time buying the upgrade, no matter if I pressed the button to execute NextProcess or not, the value stays false. Im wondering if I missed something completely or not. No other code in this class uses the booleans, nor do any of the few other classes Ive got do. So where lies the problemp

Negative 1903 pI use CreateProcessAsUser from a Windows Service in order to launch an application for the current active user. So far it works great with applications on a local drive.p  pBut if the executable exists on a network share, the service generates 5 ERRORACCESSDENIED when I use the full server name myserverpathapp.exe. I can also generate 2 ERRORFILENOTFOUND if I use the mapped drive instead Ppathapp.exe.p  pI can launch the application fine from explorer. It really sounds like I cannot get a proper token duplicate as the service fails to properly impersonate me on the server.p  pI tried several different implementations of CreateProcessAsUser from various posts to no avail.

Negative 1903 pIm learning OpenGL 3 using LWJGL. I have tried to implement an equivalent to codegluLookAtcode, and although it works am I somewhat confused as to why.p  pI confess to just copying this code from various sources on the web, but after much study I think understand the maths behind it, and that I understand what LWJGL is doing.p  pHowever the correct codegluLookAtcode code behaved incorrectly in my application, as the camera seemed to be turning the wrong way. I only managed to get my code working by transposing the orthonormal vectors codeforwardcode, codesidecode, and codeupcode hope Im using the correct terminology, which Im pretty sure is wrong...p  precodeprivate static final Vector3f forward  new Vector3f private static final Vector3f side  new Vector3f private static final Vector3f up  new Vector3f private static final Vector3f eye  new Vector3f  public static Matrix4f lookAtfloat eyeX, float eyeY, float eyeZ,                                float centerX, float centerY, float centerZ,                                float upX, float upY, float upZ      forward.setcenterX  eyeX, centerY  eyeY, centerZ  eyeZ     forward.normalise      up.setupX, upY, upZ      Vector3f.crossforward, up, side     side.normalise      Vector3f.crossside, forward, up     up.normalise      Matrix4f matrix  new Matrix4f     matrix.m00  side.x     matrix.m01  side.y     matrix.m02  side.z      matrix.m10  up.x     matrix.m11  up.y     matrix.m12  up.z      matrix.m20  forward.x     matrix.m21  forward.y     matrix.m22  forward.z      matrix.transpose  lt My dumb hack      eye.seteyeX, eyeY, eyeZ     matrix.translateeye      return matrix  codepre  pI dont think I should be doing the transpose, but it doesnt work without it. I put codetransposecode because I couldnt be bothered to retype all the matrix cell positions btwp  pMy understanding is that the form of the lookAt matrix should be as followsp  precode[ side.x  up.x  fwd.x  0 ] [ 1  0  0  eye.x ] [ side.y  up.y  fwd.y  0 ] [ 0  1  0  eye.y ] [ side.z  up.z  fwd.z  0 ] [ 0  0  1  eye.z ] [      0     0      0  1 ] [ 0  0  0       1 ] codepre  pAnd I think that the LWJGL codeMatrix4fcode class represents matrix cells as codemltcolgtltrowgtcode. The codetranslateVector3fcode method does the followingp  precodepublic static Matrix4f translateVector3f vec, Matrix4f src, Matrix4f dest    ...     dest.m30  src.m00  vec.x  src.m10  vec.y  src.m20  vec.z     dest.m31  src.m01  vec.x  src.m11  vec.y  src.m21  vec.z     dest.m32  src.m02  vec.x  src.m12  vec.y  src.m22  vec.z     dest.m33  src.m03  vec.x  src.m13  vec.y  src.m23  vec.z   ...  codepre  pSo I am left hugely confused as to what part of this I have screwed up. Is it my understanding of the lookAt matrix, the columnrow majorness is that a word of codeMatrix4fcode, or something else Is the rest of my code just broken Is it actually correct and Im just worrying too much Am I just an idiotp  pThanks.p

Negative 1903 pI am working on a webapp in PHPMySQL and I have come to the point where I need to create a usergroup association.p  pHere is what I am shooting forp  ul lipI am going to have an ever growing number of groups and users. pli lipThe users are going to be able to modify their group associationsbr whenever they want.pli lipThe group association is going to dictate the priority of contentbr displayed on the site.pli lipEmail updates sent to user will be determined by their current group  associations.pli ul  pMy question is, what is the best way to handle this usergroup associationp  pMy current table structure looks like this Simplified for ease of communicationp  precodeUsers UserID, Username, Fname, Lname, isdealer  Deals DealID, DealerID, Dealname, Dealcontent  Dealers DealerID, UserID, Dealername, Dealer address.. etc. codepre  pMy initial thoughts are to create a Groups table with GroupID, and Groupname columns. Then I could do one of two thingsp  pI could create a column in the Groups table called UserID and for every group association I have a row that states the GroupID, the Groupname, and the UserID. That option feels like it would create a huge super redundant database table.p  pThe other option I could think of would be to create a GroupID column in the Users table and just fill it with all of the groups a user is associated with in some sort of array of text that would have to be parsed. The issue here is that I want there to be an unlimited number of groups, and jamming all of a users group associations into one value for each row in my user table seems super sloppy.p  pReally this is a SQL database logicdesign question.

Negative 1903 pAs the title says, I would like to reuse a given ShaderMaterial for different meshes, but with a different set of uniforms for each mesh in fact, some uniforms may vary between meshes, but not necessarily all of them is it possible p  pIt seems a waste of resources to me to have to create a full ShaderMaterial for each mesh in this circumstance, the idea being to have a single vertexfragment shader program but to configurate it through different uniforms, whose values would change depending on the mesh. If I create a new ShaderMaterial for each mesh, I will end up with a lots of duplications vertexfragment programs  all other data members of the Material  ShaderMaterial classes.p  pIf the engine was able to call a callback before drawing a mesh, I could change the uniforms and achieve what I want to do. Another possibility would be to have a LiteShaderMaterial which would hold a pointer to the shared ShaderMaterial  only the specific uniforms for my mesh.p  pNote that my question is related to this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14145275threejsmanymesheswiththesamegeometryandmaterialcanichangetheircothree.js Many meshes with the same geometry and material, can I change their colorsa but is still different, as Im mostly concerned about the waste of resources  performance wise I dont think it would be a lot different between having multiple ShaderMaterial or a single one, as the engine should be smart enough to note that all materials have the same programs and dont resend them to the gfx card.p  pThanksp

Negative 1903 pIve been a lurker for some time on Stackoverflow, and here is my first iOS post.p  pI am implementing a UINavigationController programmatically and am using it for the default back buttons.

lost even though we can still see it on the screen.That is why I am getting an empty excel sheet right now.p  pSecondly,Since I am creating the gridview on button click and not on the page load,the data of the gridview is not available in the       protected void Button2Clickobject sender, EventArgs e  function.p  pOnly option now to make it working is I should do the same operations of executing the query again on button2Click function also.p  pBut again I dont think this is an efficient way.And moreover I am running a complex query that may take 3 4 mins at times to give the output.So running the query two times is out of question. I also tried caching the dataset but it did not work.Even creating session in not working.p  pI have been breaking my head on this since last 1 day. Please help me Thank you.p

Negative 1903 pSuppose I have a table codeSTUDENTcode with columns including codeIDcode, codenamecode, codeemailcode, and codeadvisorIDcode. And I have a second table codeADVISORcode with fields including codeIDcode and codenamecode. codeSTUDENT.AdvisorIDcode is a foreign key. When inserting a student, you must have a key pointing toward an codeADVISORcode.p  pWhen inserting a student from the application, however, you only have an codeADVISORcode name. In other words, you have strings with a particular students name and email, as well as the advisors name, but not the Advisor ID.p  pSomehow I just cant get my head wrapped around how to do this. I know its a common situation, and Ive even found one or two similar Qs asked in the past on stackoverflow. I know were talking about INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... FROM .. WHERE. I assume the WHERE clause is advisor.nameanAdvisorName but Im struggling with the fact some of the info getting inserted is from a table and some is not. Discussions about this kind of statement seem to center on instances where all the data being inserted is from a second table. Thats not what Im talking about.p  pp.s. To make it simple, please dont worry about duplicate entries, multiple advisors with the same name, etc.p

Negative 1903 pIm attempting to build a multitenant application using Play Framework 2.2 and have run into a problem.  I want to set a session key in the global codeonRouteRequestcode or codeonRequestcode in Java that identifies the site ID for the domain the user is requesting.  In literally dozens of other frameworks this type of thing is painless e.g. Django, but Im learning that the session object in Play is apparently immutable, however.p  pSo, right now, I have something like this p  precodeoverride def onRouteRequestrequest RequestHeader Option[Handler]       if request.session.getsite.isEmpty          val id  models.Site.getSiteUIDFromURLrequest.host.toLowerCase.toString       if id.isEmpty        what goes here to set the session       else         not found  redirect to a general notFound page                 super.onRouteRequestrequest    codepre  pAnd, although its not the most efficient way using a database lookup, it works for testing right now.  I need to be able to set a session key in the global but am completely lost on how to do that.  If there are any better methods I am all ears perhaps wrapping my controllers.p  pIm open to solution examples in either Java or Scala.p

Negative 1903 pSo heres my situation. I have a class library in C. It exposes some types like codeRectanglecode. It also exposes some methods for doing algorithmic computation.p  pIt seemed like a good idea to write those algorithmic bits in F. So I added another F library project to the solution.p  pNow heres the issue. In order for the F project to do algorithmic computations it needs to know about the codeRectanglecode from the C project. And in order for the C project to be able to use the F functions it needs to reference the F project. So theres the circular reference.p  pOne possible solution is to have a third project where I can define the codeRectanglecode, then reference that project from both F and C, and then reference the F project from C so I can use the functions.p  pThe issue with this is that then the user of my library would have to not only reference my C project but also the extra third project because the use needs to supply the input to the algorithm.p  pThis isnt really acceptable since using F is just an implementation detail and I dont want it to have any overhead on the way my library is used.p  pSo lets say the codeRectanglecode stays in the C project. The interface to the F implementation the method in C that calls the function in F of the algorithm is also in the C project. How do I link it all up so it works Are there any other options evenp  pIt seems odd to me to refuse circular references. Tightly bound projects like this one dont really have a directed graph structure.p  pTheres an extra method Im aware of. The F project having its own codeRectanglecode and then do serialization and deserialization on both ends. This is both tedious and contrary to the original idea of using F to make my code simpler.p

I suppose in a 3x3 triangular matrixes look like thisp  precode1 1 1     1 0 0  0 1 1     1 1 0  0 0 1     1 1 1 codepre  pHeres my codep  precode    bool flag     int count  0     for int i  0 i lt n i         for int j  0 j lt n j                      if i gt j ampamp a[i][j]  0  i lt j ampamp a[i][j]  0                              count                 break                            for int i  0 i lt n i         for int j  0 j lt n j                      if i lt j ampamp a[i][j]  0  i gt j ampamp a[i][j]  0                              count                 break                            if count  2 flag  false     else flag  true     cout ltlt flag codepre  pNow, about the issue  the two examples of matrixes I gave before the code should always return 1 true as they are triangular by definition, while, say, thisp  precode0 1 0 0 0 5 1 3 4 codepre  pshould always return 0 false as it is by no means triangular. My problem is that no matter what I input, fore some reason it always returns 1 true telling me that the matrix is triangular while it clearly is not. My question is how can I possibly fix this I have absolutely no idea what my mistake is though I suspect it has something to do with my count approach, which is basically  if some of the conditions for a triangular matrix is not met  break the cycle and add 1 to the counter, then check if its a reversed triangular matrix and if it still isnt add one more to the counter. In the end, the counter will be either 1 or 2, which will indicate whether the matrix is triangular or not. Theres a leak somewhere and I cant seem to be able to find it. If it turns out its all wrong, Im open for suggestions to do it some other way.p

Negative 1903 pI am a new user and relatively new to C  C so bear with mep  pI am developing a real time network data sonification application for a university project, that synthesises sounds for packets captures by a simple packet sniffer using libpcap.p  pRight now it is able to do this, but the sheer volume of traffic often means my audio synthesis cant keep up.p  pI need to be able to log and track tcp conversations as Wireshark is able to do, so that I can synthesise sounds for an entire tcp connection rather than each individual packet.

Negative 1903 pIm new to Android and my app uses Bluetooth to receive data from a small load cell amplifier. While in some devices Samsung ones the BT signal strength RSSI vary as expected from around 20, at short distance, to around 80, at 10m, in some others one LG model, at least the RSSI are quite weird, as around 200 positive value at short distance. Im supposing that LG phone is not giving RSSI values in dBm. In all cases Samsung tablets and LG phones were always connected to the same remote device the amplifier sample that my customer is developing. Actually my question is if it is normal, in this case, that different Android devices or different Android versions answer differently to the same API call.p

Negative 1903 pIm using Oracle 9g at the moment and writing a package, which Im fairly new to.  I have some procedures in the package that load data into tables from external tables.  It drops those tables first, recreates it with some transformations from the external table, and then creates the indexes for it. I cant just reference the external tables as I need indexes and a few changes to the data.p  pI then have some other procedures later on in the package that reference these temporary tables to do their work.  It all works fine, except if, when running the procedures in order, the procedure that creates the table gets interrupted after it drops it, but before it creates it.p  pNo if I make a change to the package body it compiles with errors as the later procedure that reference that table inform me that the table does not exist. Nor can I now run any of the procedures due to this validation error.p  pCan anyone advise of any best practices or how best to do these without getting these validation errors  Or is there a way to turn off this validation somehowp  pMany thanks, Danp

Negative 1903 pWe have the following scenario that we would like to solve using Apache Camelp  pAn asynchronous request arrives to an AMQP endpoint configured in Camel. This message contains a header property for a replyto that should be used for the response. Camel must pass this message to another service using JMS and then route the response back to the replyto queue from the AMQP request. This seems like a textbook example for using the InOut functionality in Camel but we have one problem The reply from JMS service could take a long time, in some cases several days. p  pAs I understand it, if we are using InOut it would mean that we would lock a thread to the the long running service. If we are unlucky, we could get several long running calls simultaneously and in the worst case scenario it could be that all threads are busy waiting for replies thus clogging the system.p  pWhat strategy should I use for solving the problem described above At the moment, I have created to separate routes One that listens to the AMQP endpoint and forwards the message to the JMS endpoint. The other route listens to the replytoqueue for the jms system and would be responsible for sending the reply back to the AMQP replyto. The problem I have right now is how I should store the AMQP replyto between these two routes and I am not sure this is a good solution overall for this problem.p  pAny tips or ideas on how to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1903 pIm using stringizing operator to convert parameter which may contains comma passed to a macro into string.

Negative 1903 pI am writing a program that allows the user to create expedition kit lists. The last area I need to configure is multiplying the amounts of equipment from a saved expedition per person by how many people are on the expedition, to give the user how much of that piece of equipment they will need.p  pHowever, the problem is, when the user enters how much of a certain equipment they would like, the unit goes with the amount. For example, in the file, it looks like this Water 100mlp  pSo, I need to multiply the 100 by a number, but need to separate it from ml first. I have no code necessary to show, as I dont have any idea where to start.p  pNote I am using python 3.2, I can easily change some syntax, but any extra effort to change it would be great, but dont bother too much p

I want it to be positioned next to items in the main menu.p  pAbsolute positioning doesnt work because the height of the page keeps changing and the element I am trying to position gets positioned relative to its parent.p  pIs there a way to absolutely position an element relative to the html tag instead of the parent Essentially I want to position like if the element was fixed so it always appears on the same place on the page, but it should be part of the document tree and scroll with the page.p  pstrongEDITstrong The element cant be moved so the positioning needs to be done though CSS entirely.p

Negative 1903 pIve got a simple GUIp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com3Y8WGMd.png altcurrent guip  pWhich combines the command from the dropdown with an optional parameter, and formats them as shown with ltltConnectParameterp  pId like to basically add 56 more of these things, so that I can have a bunch of different commandparameter combos set up by default, and be able to just press the respective Send button, rather than changing one each time there are a few combos which are used very oftenp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comRI2OYUS.png altdesired gui obviously the single String Being Sent isnt really relevant anymore, as it depends on which Send you clickp  pThis was done just by copypasting the code for each one.  I know UserControls exist thats what I should be doing, right but Im using MVVMrelay commands and am unsure if theyll work without codebehind.p  pMy naive approach is to make a struct of command enums and parameter stringsp  precodestruct CommandString      public CommandEnum Command     public string Parameter  codepre  pStore them in a list, and hard code each row on the UI to a different index in the list, then hard code the Send button to pass in that same index to the relay command so it knows which one to use.p  pCan I make use of a UserControl to cut down on the copypasting  Will it work with MVVM and relay commandsp

Negative 1903 pI have two questions the first on the cause of the specific error Im trying to solve here, the second on the validity of my approach to the problem.p  pIm trying to create a state machine that uses member function pointers, and Im lost in the details. Other QAs on the member function pointer topic seem to deal with calling the member functions from outside the class, and advocate the use of stdfunction and stdbind. I also read a hrefhttpwww.parashift.comcfaqpointerstomembers.html relnofollow titleC FAQthe C FAQ on pointers to member functionsa which also gives examples of calling the member functions outside the class. Im not entirely sure those examples apply to what Im trying to do.p  pThis state machine approach is general across what Im trying to do for this embedded application This is the first real application Ive written in C. If this approach is stupid, please help me toward a better solution.. The specific code below is for the MessageHandler class.

Negative 1903 pWe have a rails 3.2 app that has quite a few database tables and we are hitting the database quite often.

I defined an enum for this with values within the space of HRESULTs which is reserved for userdefined codes.p  pThis is fine in a C client however when VB is the client, or Java wrappers such as JACOB, it appears to intercept the HRESULT and there is no way that the client can tell which successful code occurred. p  pIs it actually a terrible design to have the HRESULT indicate anything other than code0code or exceptions  should I instead make new functions that have an code[out]code parameter to get which button is usedp

Negative 1903 pI posted a question earlier and got a great answer but realize I went about my logic the wrong way.

My last question asked and answered how to pull the high and low values for three different fields for a given unique name into a new table.  This turns out to not be what I needed although the first question successfully was answered and marked as such. What I need are the values for two fields from the high and low values of another field for a given name. If you look at the question you will see this is so and the solutions are in fact differentp

The widget will have its own CSS that emmust not break the host applications CSS.emp  pThe widget will live in a nice little DIV with a specific ID.p  pSo what were trying to do is modify the LESS files that compile Bootstrap to reference that specific ID. Im getting close to doing this, but I keep running into issues. The current issue I have is that the Bootstrap LESS code uses mixins to create GRIDspecific CSS in the GRID.LESS file. When I try to add my selector to the GRID.LESS file, it doesnt behave like Id expecthope Instead of applying my ID selector to all the class selectors in the GRID.LESS file, it only applies to the first selector in a list of selectors.p  pAs a little background on Bootstrap as I understand it hopefully so those of you with LESS experience can answer my question even if youve never used Bootstrap the source LESS files are all referenced via import statements in the BOOTSTRAP.LESS file. I use Grunt to compile the Bootstrap.CSS and JS files per Bootstraps website documentation so a Grunt.JSON file exists that orchestrates the LESS compiling and a bunch of other stuff. BOOTSTRAP.LESS uses import to access VARIABLES.LESS, MIXINS.LESS, and GRID.LESS, which are all players in this drama.p  pHopefully I can explain what I meanp  pOriginal Code Bootstrap 3.1.1s GRID.LESS file containsp  precode Columns   Common styles for small and large grid columns .makegridcolumns codepre  pThat code calls a mixin in the MIXIN.LESS file that dynamically creates some column class selectorsp  precode.makegridcolumns     Common styles for all sizes of grid columns, widths 112   .colindex when index  1   initial     item .colxsindex, .colsmindex, .colmdindex, .collgindex     .colindex  1, item      .colindex, list when index lt gridcolumns   general lt isnt a typo     item .colxsindex, .colsmindex, .colmdindex, .collgindex     .colindex  1, list, item      .colindex, list when index gt gridcolumns   terminal     list        position relative        Prevent columns from collapsing when empty       minheight 1px        Inner gutter via padding       paddingleft  gridgutterwidth  2       paddingright gridgutterwidth  2           .col1  kickstart it  codepre  pI dont fully understand the code above, but I think it loops through the parameters it receives from the VARIABLES.LESS file that comes with Bootstrap, and creates the list of class selectors into CSS that looks like thisp  precode.colxs1, .colsm1, .colmd1, .collg1, .colxs2, .colsm2, .colmd2, .collg2, .colxs3, .colsm3, .colmd3, .collg3, .colxs4, .colsm4, .colmd4, .collg4, .colxs5, .colsm5, .colmd5, .collg5, .colxs6, .colsm6, .colmd6, .collg6, .colxs7, .colsm7, .colmd7, .collg7, .colxs8, .colsm8, .colmd8, .collg8, .colxs9, .colsm9, .colmd9, .collg9, .colxs10, .colsm10, .colmd10, .collg10, .colxs11, .colsm11, .colmd11, .collg11, .colxs12, .colsm12, .colmd12, .collg12     position relative    minheight 1px    paddingleft 15px    paddingright 15px  codepre  pThe modification I made was to add my custom ID selector scope around the call, like belowp  precode Columns   Common styles for small and large grid columns myidselector .makegridcolumns codepre  pThe problem is that this doesnt apply my selector across all the dynamically generated columns that Bootstrap creates in the MIXIN.LESS code, and instead only adds my ID selector to the first selector in the list, like thisp  precodemyidselector .colxs1, .colsm1, .colmd1, .collg1, .colxs2, .colsm2, .colmd2, .collg2, .colxs3, .colsm3, .colmd3, .collg3, .colxs4, .colsm4, .colmd4, .collg4, .colxs5, .colsm5, .colmd5, .collg5, .colxs6, .colsm6, .colmd6, .collg6, .colxs7, .colsm7, .colmd7, .collg7, .colxs8, .colsm8, .colmd8, .collg8, .colxs9, .colsm9, .colmd9, .collg9, .colxs10, .colsm10, .colmd10, .collg10, .colxs11, .colsm11, .colmd11, .collg11, .colxs12, .colsm12, .colmd12, .collg12      position relative     minheight 1px     paddingleft 15px     paddingright 15px  codepre  pWhat I find odd is that if I just write a LESS file without the mixin to apply my ID selectors scope to a list of selectors, I get the output that Im expecting.

Negative 1903 pI have the need to defer the processing of a directive nested inside another one until an asynchronous operation is performed by the nesting directive. This is easily done with two lines of JQuery, but I was wondering if there was a purely Angular way to do the same, maybe using q. p  pIn a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4smtgs3f1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net4smtgs3f1a you can find an example of what I mean p  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMyCtrlgt     ltloadData urlhttpip.jsontest.comgt         lttransformAndOutputgt     ltloadDatagt ltdivgt codepre  ploadData is loading data from some URI, while one or more transformers handle the processing and display of the data. BTW, in the JSFiddle I use two different loadData directives loadData1 uses ihttpi asynchronously and fails to load the data in time, while loadData2 uses JQuery i.ajaxi synchronously and works very well. p  pSo the problem is ihttpi only works asynchronously, and the inner directive is processed bbeforeb the asynchronous loading operation has completed.

Negative 1903 pIve been working to animate a box with no set height and width. So far its working, with a little problem. p  pThe box contains text buttons, all with the same width and the text centered. The problem is not all text is the same lenght, so while animating the shorter texts scrolls from left to center. Its not a big problem, but it looks a bit stupid.p  pDe code is below, and here is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2rrwof2w5 relnofollowFiddlea to demonstrate. Ive set the animation on 1500 to make the problem more obvious. As you see the short button scrolls to the middle. What I would like  if possible  is for the buttons to be set in the middle, so the are allready in the right position whilst animating.p  pI dont know it it is possible at all, but if so, any help would be appreciated.p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idprefboxwrapgt     ltdiv idprefbox classprefboxm1 prefboxcllgt         ltdiv classprefboxmm11 prefboxcldgtHeaderltdivgt         ltdiv classprefboxx222 act fsc1,1910gt             ltdiv classprefboxy222gtltspan classsp1 prefboxclbgtltspan classsp2gtShortltspangtltspangt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classprefboxx222 act fsc1,1920gt             ltdiv classprefboxy222gtltspan classsp1 prefboxclbgtltspan classsp2gtThis is a longer button ltspan idfgrgttgrltspangtltspangtltspangt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classprefboxx222 act fsc1,1930gt             ltdiv classprefboxy222gtltspan classsp1 prefboxclbgtltspan classsp2gtAnd another very very very long button ltspan idfklgttgrltspangtltspangtltspangt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodeprefboxwrap      position absolute     margintop 20px     marginleft 35px     zindex2030  .prefboxm1      position absolute     visibility hidden     fontsize 1em     zindex2926     webkitboxshadow 0 14px 14px 0px 000     mozboxshadow 0 14px 14px 0px 000     boxshadow 3px 3px 3px 0px fff  .prefboxmm11      height 24px     padding 2px 0 2px 9px     color fff     textalign left     fontweight bold     fontsize 100  .prefboxx222      margin 2px 0     padding 5px     background blue  .prefboxy222      lineheight 29px     whitespace nowrap     height 29px     width 100     color fff     background orange  .prefboxy222 .sp1      display block     width 100     margin 0     padding 0     textalign center     bordertop 1px solid fff     borderleft 1px solid fff     borderbottom 1px solid 333     borderright 1px solid 333  .prefboxy222 .sp2      padding 0 15px     webkituserselect none     mozuserselect none     msuserselect none  codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong I solved the problem with the answer below, but there was another problem, by animating the box wasnt flexible anymore. So replacing the buttontext or changing the fontsize on the run didnt change the size of the box anymore. I solved that by adding 3 lines of code to the jquery animation copy the content of the cointainer, change the css name and replace the containercontent after animating.

Negative 1903 pI know that Dnotify is old and there is a new api called Inotify, but I have to work with linux kernel 2.6.9, so the only option is to use dnotify.p  pI have a basic program to watch a directory using dnotify, Im watching for DNCREATE and DNDELETE events. The program works good, it respond to every change. In my callback function I start a python script which acts as a filter there are several files in that directory and I need to detect changes only about few of them. In that filter I save the state of the directory filelist to a file, so I can latter make a diff of current and old state and detect what file was modified.p  pEverything was working great until we figured out that the change I have to respond doesnt always come from creating or deleting the files of interest, but also from changes in their content. So i added the DNMODIFY bits, now it works as excepted, but Im also getting 2 modify signals every second which I filter out in the python script. The signals are received because in that directory there are 2 files to which is written every second by some external program I dont have reach.p  pLaunching a python interpreter twice a second seems as a waste of cpu plus this notification is running on a systems where I cannot waste a lot of cpu because those are testing machines where are our tests performed.p  pSo is there a way, to exlude those 2 files that change every secondp  pA few thoughtsp  ul liMove the filter from python to C  this may by faster but it still be detecting two changes every secondli liCreate a link to a file of interest when it is created, and put this link into a separate directory and watch for changes in that directory, after the file is deleted  destroy the link and stop the watch program.li ul  pEDIT I tried that second thought and it did not work, because dnotify wasnt detecting changes to that file when written to from outside of watched directoryp  pDoes anybody have any other ideas or better yet solutions to this kind of problemp  pThanksp

Negative 1903 pI have an array, collection view uses data from array while creating cells. Im adding some objects  the beginning of the array, when my collectionview is almost at the top.

I start scrolling to top, and when i get to section 4, 10 more items are added to the array that means 10 more sections are to appear. So section 4 must become section 14 now. So it does, but my scrollView contentOffset does not change, and new Section 4 is visible instantly, so it calles this method again to add 10 more items and so on.p  pWhen i use this method to add objects at the end of the array, it works fine. Sections get added at the bottom and I scroll fine.p  pI thought of a solution to determine height of all the new sections added, and add this value to the current contentOffset, but i dont see how can i calculate the height.p  hr  pUpdate p  precode  ifindexPath.section lt sectionLimitBeforeLoadingMoreSections  load  beginning              ifself.isLoading                      self.isLoading  YES             CGFloat height  self.contentSize.height             [self performBatchUpdates                                [self loadNewMonthsAtTheBeginning10]                  [self insertSections[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndexesInRangeNSMakeRange0, 10]]                                          completionBOOL finished                               self.contentOffset  CGPointMakeself.contentOffset.x,self.contentOffset.y  self.contentSize.height  height                  self.isLoading  NO              ]               codepre  pSeems to work well, but i get a little freeze when performing batch, any way to avoid thatp

Negative 1903 pI have a problem with DPD Api. I hope someone has been using this web services in your own projects.p  pConnection and authorization are okey. I can generate packages numbers by using codegeneratePackagesNumbersV1code method. It works fine. I get waybills. I also can generate sped labels by using codegenerateSpedLabelsV1code method. These labels are in PDF format and I generate the easily. p  pBut... I have a problem with generating protocol by using codegenerateProtocolV1code method. Funny thing is that generating sped labels and generating protocols gets the same parameters. But although I send the same parameters to this method  it does not return a PDF file.p  pThis question is directed primerity to people who have been in contact with DPD Api, because its a slightly specific question. Has anyone used this API I work with documentation of course but this documentation isnt so good and cant help me. I use VB.NET but it really doesnt matter here.p

Negative 1903 pI am running a binary logistic regression in SPSS, to test the effect of e.g. TV advertisements on the probability of a consumer to buy a product. My problem is that with the formula of binary logistic regressionp  precodeP11eabAdv  codepre  pthe maximum probability will be equal to 100. However,even if I increase the number of advertisements by 1000, it is not sensible to assume that the probability to purchase will be 100. So if I draw the graph of the logistic regression with the coefficients from the Binary Logistic Regression, at some point the probability reaches 100, which is never the case in a real life setting. How can I control for thatp  pIs there a way to change the SPSS binary logistic regression to have a maximum probability of e.g. 20p  pThank youp

So what i have done is that the geoolcaion function displays the location on the web page using the following functionp  precodefunction geoFindMe   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPositionsuccess, error, geooptions function successposition  var latitude  position.coords.latitude  var longitude  position.coords.longitude  var altitude  position.coords.altitude  var accuracy  position.coords.accuracy  var time  getTime  post the everything somewhere and then the callback function will fetch the info   may use var time  position.timestamp  result.appendtime     latitude     longitude    function errorerror   alertUnable to retrieve your location due to error.code      error.message  there was a semicolon here  var geooptions    enableHighAccuracy true,  maximumAge  30000,  timeout  27000    codepre  pthis function is called by the following codep  precode geoFindMefunction successful         first call geoFindMe function then call successful as a callback         the function will retrieve the information that was displayed by the geoFindMe on the webpage             result.hide             var currentLocation  document.getElementByIdresult             document.getElementByIdresult.innerHTML               var moved  hasMovedpreviousLocation, currentLocation             var time  isItTimemoved, lastBuffer, 15             iftimeits time to put the location in the buffer                 currentLocation  currentLocation   this way we will be able to differentiate between different locations                 charBuffer.wrapcurrentLocation                          dumpstringArray, lastDump, true          codepre  pwhat i am trying to do is once the geolocation is found then call the successful function which i am trying to make a callback function. the problem is that for some reason it is skipping over most of the successful callback function and it continues with the line dump... any suggestions perhaps i am not writing the successful function properly thanks a lotp

Negative 1903 pI havent been able to find a question online similar to this, so I thought I would submit the question. In most cases it seems people have the opposite problem were lag may be occurring during a touch event, but I am seeing the exact opposite. I am creating an air hockey game and each frame the pieces are moved based on their current parameters, and the game is redrawn while in the background the override ontouch listener is looking for motion events. The thing is there is noticeable lag when there is no fingers touching the screen and just watching the animated pieces, but as long as there is any form of motion event happening, if ontouch is being called, then the animation is smooth. I really can not figure why this is, my best educated guess is the interrupt that is checking if ontouch should be called is consuming more resources than it should, but I know nothing about how to modify or check the ontouch interrupt behavior at all so hopefully someone might know.p  pA little more background on how everything is organized. The overall class is located in Main.java, it is created here and requests the Context view, the game class is an extension of ImageView. The game class has a override OnTouchEvent, which has all the defintions for what to do depending on what state and what motion event. The class also has a draw method, and at the end of the method it calls h.postDelayedr, FRAMERATE where r is a Runnable with Override public void run which just calls invalidate. h is just a handler that is initialized in the class. So each time the game is drawn invalidate will be called after the FRAMERATE elapse time of 10ms, which tells the game to redraw. All the move functions for the game are also called from the draw method. The OnTouch is happening all along side this process so why would it be smoother if on OnTouch is being called rather than checking if its true, it all seems counter intuitive but Im sure there is a logical reason. Lastly the lag time was measurable using the system clock and was time dependent based on where exactly it was called. It just showed an increase in passing time between the games move function when a touch event was not occurring.p  pSorry for the long response without much actual code context, I hope it is descriptive enough. The code its self is rather long so I didnt think it would help to post that, but if needed I can do better at re posting some pseudo code with the visualized hierarchy. Thank you for any help and suggestions for this problem. It would be great to be able to understand why it is happening.p  pHere is the code, I was trying to fit it into a comment didnt realize you had to post it by editing the original post.p    precodepublic class Main extends Activity   Game game private Menus menus  contains menu info int menu keep track of what menu you are at  Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.main      game  new Gamethis     setContentViewgame     Override public void onDestroy      super.onDestroy   Override protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data   super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data      ..some code here to process photo files   get the orientation of loaded pictures public static int getOrientationContext context, Uri photoUri       its on the external media.

Negative 1903 pIn maven projects the version of a project is contained in the codeltversiongtcode attritbute of the pom.xml file. When creating a new release in the git flow model I need to bumb the version number. a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodelreleasebranchesThis articlea explains how this is done without mavenp  ol liCreate a release branchli liChange the version number and commitli liMerge the release branch both to develop and masterli ol  pAdditionally it saysp  blockquote   pIt is exactly at the start of a release branch that the upcoming release gets assigned a version numbernot any earlier. Up until that moment, the develop branch reflected changes for the next release, but it is unclear whether that next release will eventually become 0.3 or 1.0, until the release branch is started. That decision is made on the start of the release branch and is carried out by the projects rules on version number bumping.p blockquote  pI see two problems in conjunction with maven herep  ol liThe version under development in maven would be [next version]SNAPSHOT. So we cannot really postpone the decision which version is next up to the moment we create a release branch. Of course if we can change our mind later, but we already need to enter some value here earlier.li liBefore creating our release the version in the pom.xml was lets say code1.1SNAPSHOTcode. Now we have changed that to simply code1.1code on the release branch and merged that to master. Fine. But we should also merge that branch back to develop and for that we need to adapt the version to e.g. code1.2SNAPSHOTcode. And probably we should not have done that on the release branch because that commit should not be part of the release. Actually we probably should have made this change right after branching off develop because all future commits on develop will be for the next version.li ol  pWhen googling for the problem I found some articles about mavenplugins that can automate the process, which may be interesting, but this question is really on how the git graph should look like and where the version bump commits should be and not how I can automate this using a mavenplugin.p

Negative 1903 pSo for this program we are to use recursion.

Negative 1903 pSo Im new to Laravel and trying to make a permissions system for the users on my application. Here is my approachp  p1 Place a column in users table with the name permissions 2 Create a table of permissions with columns id and pagenamep  pHeres how it will workp  ul lipEach page will be assigned an ID. For example, the page strongManage Accountsstrong has id strong1strong and the page strongManage Customersstrong has the id strong2strong in the permissions table.pli lipIn order to give user full access to Manage Accounts and view only access to Manage Customers, I will make the following entry in the permissions column for the user strong1.1111,2.1000strongpli lipNow when the user will land on the Manage Accounts page, I will get the page id for the current page from the permissions table, i.e. strong1strong. I will then convert the string value from the users.permissions column in the following format strongarray1  1111, 2  1000strong. Now I can get the user permissions saved against the ID of the page by strongpermissions[1]strong.pli lipI will then have a function to parse the 4 digits and get boolean values for the following in the exact orderp  pcanView  truep  pcanAdd  truep  pcanEdit  truep  pcanDelete  truepli lipNow inside my page, I can easily put checks and display items accordingly.pli ul  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  p1 So first question. Is this a good approach Or are there better ways for going about this I like this approach because I only have to add one more table in the database and it will only have as many entries as there are pages on my application, which arent many. And it also means that I will only have to access the database once and I can then keep on using the values in the variable.p  p2 Should I create a separate class for permissions Im new so I dont completely understand the Eloquent class. But is that something I should be using for this Or should I just add the functions that I need to create to the users classp  p3 Where should I store the values of canView, CanEdit etc. Should I place them in the class for permissions and create an object for it Or should I just use the Users class and access them using Auth I do not want to use Session, I dont think it to be safe.p  p4 Can I somehow have the permissions autoload every time a page is opened I was looking into beforeFilter, and thinking of creating adding it to the constructor of each controller.

Negative 1903 pContinuing to work on my port of a CakePHP 1.3 app to 3.0, and have run into another issue. I have a number of areas where functionality varies based on certain settings, and I have previously used a modular component approach. For example, Leagues can have roundrobin, ladder or tournament scheduling. This impacts on the scheduling algorithm itself, such that there are different settings required to configure each type, but also dictates the way standings are rendered, ties are broken, etc. This is just one of 10 areas where I have something similar, though not all of these suffer from the problem below.p  pMy solution to this in the past was to create a LeagueComponent with a base implementation, and then extend that class as LeagueRoundRobinComponent, LeagueLadderComponent and LeagueTournamentComponent. When controllers need to do anything algorithmspecific, they check the scheduletype field in the leagues table, create the appropriate component, and call functions in it. This still works just fine.p  pI mentioned that this also affects views. The old solution for this was to pass the league component object from the controller to the view via codethisgtsetcode. The view can then query it for various functionality. This is admittedly a bit kludgy, but the obvious alternative seems to be extracting all the info the view might require and setting it all individually, which doesnt seem to me to be a lot better. If theres a better option, Im open to it, but Im not overly concerned about this at the moment.p  pThe problem Ive encountered is when tables need to get some of that component info. The issue at hand is when I am saving my addedit form and need to deal with the custom settings. In order to be as flexible as possible for the future, I dont have all of these possible setting fields represented in the database, but rather serialize them into a single custom column. Reading this all works quite nicely with a custom constructor and getters. I had previously done this by loading the component from the beforeSave function in the League model, calling the function that returns the list of schedulespecific settings, extracting those values and serializing them. But with the changes to component access in 3.0, it seems I can no longer create the component in my new beforeMarshal function.p  pI suppose the controller could pass the component to the table by setting it as a property, but that feels like a major kludge, and there must be a better way. It doesnt seem like extending the table class is a good solution, because that would horribly complicate associations. I dont think that a hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org3.0enormdatabasebasics.htmladdingcustomdatabasetypes relnofollowcustom typesa are the solution, as I dont see how theyd access a component either. Im leaning towards passing just the list of fields from the controller to the model, thats more of a configuration method. Speaking of configuration, I suppose it could all just go into the central Configure data store, but thats always felt to me like somewhere that you only put small data. Im wondering if theres a better design pattern I could follow that would let the table continue to take care of these implementation details on its own without the controller needing to get involved if at some point I decide to change from the serialized method to adding all of the possible columns, it would be nice to have those changes restricted to the table class.p  pOh, and keep in mind that this list of custom settings is needed in both a view and the table, so whatever solution is proposed will ideally provide a way for both of them to access it, rather than requiring duplication of code.p

Ive been searching for ways to improve this, particularly through build settings and for months had no luck. One thing I overlooked was codeSWIFTWHOLEMODULEOPTIMIZATIONcode, particularly because any mention of it claims it will increase a projects compile time. p  pSo the other day we enabled codeSWIFTWHOLEMODULEOPTIMIZATIONcode and lo and behold we have a 10x improvement on compile times. p  pThe problem is, now whenever were debugging the project and try printing an object in lldb with codepo myObjectcode Xcode immediately crashes.

Im wondering if we have some sort of unusual configuration that is causing the compile time issues, or if there is a known reason why lldb might be crashing.

Negative 1903 pI have a nib file I created for a custom view to be loaded into a ViewController. The custom view has  .background image that fills the whole view Im using it as a background  .label inside that I need to be placed in a specific location based on the size of the background image.p  pI managed to resize the background image based on the size of the screen using AutoLayout in Storyboard. It can shrink with Aspect Fit. But I want to change the constraints of the label with the same ratio as the background image resized. Meaning, if the background image shrinks by half, I want the constraints of the label to change by half. This way, they will always show up at the same spot with respect to the image.p  pBut the constraints I created in the storyboard for the label stay constant and I can not figure out how to manipulate the constraints for the label programatically.p  phere is the code for the custom class that defines the custom XIB view     import UIKitp  pIBDesignable class TestView UIView p  precodevar view UIView var nibName  TestView  IBOutlet weak var backImage UIImageView IBOutlet weak var upcomingLabel UILabel  IBInspectable var Background UIImage      get          return backImage.image          setBackground          backImage.image  Background       IBInspectable var maintenance String      get          return upcomingLabel.text          setmaintenance          upcomingLabel.text  maintenance        MARK     Implement both CustomView initializers initcoder and initframe override initframe CGRect      super.initframe frame     xibSetup  required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder      super.initcoder aDecoder     xibSetup   func xibSetup      view  loadViewFromNib     view.frame  bounds      addSubviewview  func loadViewFromNib gt UIView      let bundle  NSBundleforClass self.dynamicType     let nib  UINibnibName nibName, bundle bundle     let view  nib.instantiateWithOwnerself, options nil [0] as UIView      return view   codepre  pAnd here is how Im adding the view in the View controllerp  precodeimport UIKit  class TestVC UIViewController   IBOutlet weak var customViewContainer UIView  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      let customView  TestView     customView.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsfalse     customViewContainer.addSubviewcustomView      Add constraint to the view     let viewDictionary  [custom customView, view view]      let constraintH  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[custom], options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views viewDictionary     let constraintV  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[custom], options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views viewDictionary     let constraintWidth  NSLayoutConstraintitem customView, attribute .Width, relatedBy .Equal, toItem customViewContainer, attribute .Width, multiplier 1, constant 0     let constraintHeight  NSLayoutConstraintitem customView, attribute .Height, relatedBy .Equal, toItem customViewContainer, attribute .Height, multiplier 1, constant 0      view.addConstraintsconstraintH as [AnyObject]     view.addConstraintsconstraintV as [AnyObject]     view.addConstraintconstraintWidth     view.addConstraintconstraintHeight   override func didReceiveMemoryWarning      super.didReceiveMemoryWarning   codepre  pIm loosing my mind over this, helpp

Negative 1903 pAndroid Lollipop introduced a battery saver mode that can be turned on at any time, and turns on by default when the battery is at 15 or lower. This poses a problem for my app, since the battery saver disables animations that provide crucial information. Just to give context, my app allows users to configure an Android Wear watch face when they save a new theme, I animate the theme moving to a button on the action bar so that they know where it was saved to. When animations are disabled by the battery saver, nothing happens when they hit save, which I think would be confusing.p  pSo, is there a way to programmatically determine whether the battery saver is on That way I can provide an alternative to the animations such as displaying a Toast.p

Negative 1903 pWe have a scenario where we use multiple Web apps in Azure, when scaling up I understand Azure is simply starting more Web processes and as such allows for connections to multiple servers, theres a broadcast system in place for the synchronization. The issue is, what happens to an open socket if we manually or automatically scales down Say we have 5 servers which each have an open web socket, and we scale down to 1, what will happen to the 4 sockets that were connected to the servers that are being removed p  pAs a side note, if they stick and keep up until the socket is disconnected to the client, will Azure bill me for that timep  pIf they dont stick, its only a matter of making sure the client reconnects properly.p  pBy what Ive seen so far, it seems to stick, but that might just be a grace period while its scaling down so Id rather be on the sure here with an answer from someone who actually knows.p

Negative 1903 pI have set up a simple android web application using a webview. Id now like to include a WhatsApp share button using codewhatsappsendcode.

But the solutions provided elsewhere are not suitable for my situation.p  pThe best solution requires me to change Java code in the app itself. Since my app is not on the play store I have distributed it by letting people download the .apk file, and registration was done by a simple unique cookie that will be deleted when my users would have to update the app manually.p  pThe puzzle here is, can we find a workaround to make this work without touching the clientside but by updating the serverside.p  pI hope some smart people on here can help me.p  p Merijnp

Negative 1903 pFor business reasons, I cannot indulge the carrier or the app, but I need to test our app on phones that already have our app preinstalled.  I have no problems running my scripts on phones that do not come preinstalled with this app, only the ones with it.  The reason I believe is possibly because of the location of where the app is installed versus the location in which Calabash installs to.  I thought if I rooted an Android phone that had our app on it that this would solve the problem, but thats not the case since the app does not appear on the phone after being rooted.  Any suggestions would be appreciated and I apologize for the question being somewhat vague as I have to protect the companies involved.  Thanks for understanding.p  pTo add a little more detail so it makes more sense, this app Im testing has already been released and because its preloaded on this carriers phones, I need to be able to get permission to uninstall and then reinstall the app.  Maybe its not possible but without getting some input I wont really know.  Again, I have no problem testing on our older test phones before the carrier began preloading the app and maybe I need to just stick with testing on that for now.  The problem with this is that it limits me from being able to test on the latest OSs.  Thanks again for any input.p

Negative 1903 pI am developing a library JAR that is meant to be used across many projects.

Or, outside of a test, it helps to add a temporary codemainString[]code method to a random class and test functionality and log output as if the lib was an executable JAR. Since SLF4Js default binding is a NoOp no output whatsoever, I have been getting by so far by adding the SLF4J Simple binding as a compile configuration dependency while I am developing amp testing. Then, before I commit and publish, I simply remove the Simple binding as a dependency since each developer who uses my lib should be able to select their own binding.p  pThis is hacky and I know Gradle support a hrefhttpsdocs.gradle.orgcurrentuserguidedependencymanagement.htmlsubconfigurations relnofollowcustom configsa, but I have yet to see a coherent example that could act as a guide.

Negative 1903 pIve built a custom menu using Bootstrap collapse and a list of links within an expanding div. Most of the links are to anchors within the page. When you click a link, the menu closes. Everything works perfectly on a desktop, but on mobile the menu does not close.p  pIm pulling my hair out... from what I understand, Safari mobile does consider links to be interactive, but divs are not...
