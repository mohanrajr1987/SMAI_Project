Positive 87680 pCurrently I need to drag multiple rows from a grid and drop them to a container. As far as I read over the internet, kendo does not support this even out of the box.

Positive 87680 pHere is the scenario Im trying to achieve with the Kendo UI gridp  ol liRetrieve some persisted data via jquery, restangular, or whatever.li liBind the grid to the data.li liEdit the data in the grid.li liAdd a new row to the grid.li liClick some Save button and send the updated data back to the server.li ol  pBased on what Ive read, when using the Kendo UI grid you have to wrap the array you supply for the data source in order for the grid to update the original model.  The grids builtin commands, however, dont seem to operate correctly when you do this.  As shown in the following example, upon clicking Edit on a row, you cant then click Update or Cancel.  It just gets stuck.  If you dont wrap it with an array, the existing records are updated fine, but then you dont get new records added to the origin array.p  pa hrefhttpdojo.telerik.comaTIba relnofollowhttpdojo.telerik.comaTIbaap  pThe faulty behavior seems to have something to do with the fact that a uid is placed on the records by wrapping them with an ObservableArray.  Oddly, passing in an empty array as you might do for an Add vs and Edit dialog, the buttons work correctly and the underlying datasource is modified.p  pSo, whats wrong with this configurationp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe original example displayed the id field as one of the columns which was proving to be a distraction from the real issue for several people Ive received feedback from, so Ive removed it.  I also add the ability to add a new row and added output to see the contents of the original data source.p

Negative 87680 pIm currently trying to debug a customers issue with an FTP upload feature in one of our products. The feature allows customers to upload files lt 1MB to a central FTP server for further processing. The FTP client code was written inhouse in VB.NET.p  pThe customer reports that they receive Connection forcibly closed by remote host errors when they try to upload files in the range of 300KB to 500KB. However, we tested this inhouse with much larger files relatively speaking, i.e. 3MB and up, and never received this error. We uploaded to the same FTP server that the client connects to using the same FTP logon credentials, the only difference being that we did it from our office.p  pI know that the TCP protocol has flowcontrol builtin, so it shouldnt matter how much data is sent in a single Send call, since the protocol will throttle itself accordingly to match the servers internal limits if I remember correctly...p  pTherefore, the only thing I can think is that an intermediate host between the client and the router is artificially ratelimiting the client and disconnecting it we send the file data in a loop in 512byte chunks.p  pThis is the loop that is used to send the data buffer is a Byte array containing the file datap  precode            For i  0 To buffer.Length  1 Step 512                 mDataSocket.Sendbuffer, i, 512, SocketFlags.None                 OnTransferStatusi, buffer.Length             Next codepre  pIs it possible that the customers ISP or their own firewall is imposing an artificial ratelimit on how much data our client code can send within a given period of time If so, what is the best way to handle this situation I guess the obvious solution would be to introduce a delay in our send loop, unless there is a way to do this at the socket level.p  pIt seems really odd to me that an ISP would handle a ratelimit violation by killing the client connection. Why wouldnt they just rely on TCPIPs internal flowcontrolthrottling mechanismp

Negative 87680 pSome of the stored procedures we have contain conditional logic, like thisp  precodeCreate Procedure dbo.DoSomethingSome Parameters As     ...     If Some Condition Begin         Set SomeVariable  SomeValue                     End     ...     Select ... codepre  pWhen such a stored procedure is used as a recordsource for an MS Access form, and user tries to use builtin sortingfiltering functionality of the form, MS Access tries to execute the stored procedure in FMTONLY mode apparently, hunting for metadata of the rowset provided by the stored procedure.p  pAs most people know now including ourselves , when FMTONLY is set ON, SQL Server ignores conditional statements. In the example shown below, the strongcodeSet SomeVariable  SomeValuecodestrong statement is executed regardless of whether strongcodeSome Conditioncodestrong is true, which obviously creates some troubles for us.p  precode EXAMPLE   Create Procedure dbo.DoSomething..., vcSomeDate as VarChar50, ... As    ...    Declare dtSomeDate As Datetime    If IsDatevcSomeDateOrAgeInDays Begin         The next statement fails miserably when FMTONLYON        Set dtSomeDate  vcSomeDateOrAgeInDays    End Else Begin        ...    End    ... codepre  pIn order to circumvent this problem, we wrap conditional logic or whatever other code fragments affected by FMTONLY like thisp  precodeCreate Procedure dbo.DoSomethingSome Parameters As     ...       HACK Protection from unexpected FMTONLY mode     Declare wasFmtonlyOn As Bit If 0  1 Set wasFmtonlyOn  1 SET FMTONLY OFF     ...     If Some Condition Begin         Set SomeVariable  SomeValue                     End     ...      HACK Protection from unexpected FMTONLY mode     If wasFmtonlyOn  1 SET FMTONLY ON      ...     Select ... codepre  pThis ugly oneline formatting of the protection code is intentional we believe that hacks required to solve some weird problems do not deserve proper formatting quite the contrary, we believe that they should fit into as few lines of code as possible. p  pAnyway, this protection works fine, but it is somewhat too verbose and not as much encapsulated as we would want it to be. For example, wed definitely prefer to hide the actual logic of the hack  for example behind a scalar UDF like thisp  precodeCreate Procedure dbo.DoSomethingSome Parameters As     ...      declare wasFmtonlyOn as bit set wasFmtonlyOn  dbo.SetFmtonly0     ...     If Some Condition Begin         Set SomeVariable  SomeValue                     End     ...     dbo.SetFmtonlywasFmtonlyOn      ...     Select ... codepre  pUnfortunately, this does not seem to work  neither with scalar UDFs, not with another stored procedure. It looks like FMTONLY prevents return of any data from anywhere. So, here comes strongThe Main Questionstrongp  blockquote   pemIf you also had to deal with this problem SQL Servers ignoring conditionals in FMTONLY mode, were you able to come up with a better protection idiom than the one described aboveemp blockquote  pBTW, I still dont understand one thing Is this problem a bug or a feature in SQL Server 2005 And if it is a feature, then what could possibly be a good reason for itp  pThank youp

Negative 87680 pI know the question about measuring developer performance has been asked to death, but please bear with me. I know the age old debate about how you cannot measure performance of developers, but the reality is, at our company there is a need to do that one way or another.p  pI work for a relatively small company small in terms of developers, and management felt the need to measure developer performance based on functionality that passes test QA at first iteration. p  pWe somehow managed to convince them that this was a bad idea for various reasons, and came up instead on measuring developers by putting code in test where all unit tests passes. Since in our team there is no requirement per se to develop unit tests before, we felt it was an opportunity to formalise the need to develop unit tests  i.e. put some incentive on developers to write unit tests.p  pMy problem is this since arguably we will not be releasing code to QA that do not pass all unit tests, how can one reasonably measure developer performance based on unit tests Based on unit tests, what makes a good developer stand outp  ol liFunctionality that fail although unit test passesli liNot writing unit test for a given functionality at all, or not adequate unit tests writtenli liQuality of unit test writtenli liNumber of Unit tests writtenli ol  pAny suggestions would be much appreciated.

Negative 87680 pIve been working on this for awhile, now.  You might also call it a reverse mask, or an inverse mask.p  pBasically, Im creating a view window within a display object.  I need to allow objects on the stage that are under the window to be able to interact with the mouse.p  pThis is similar to a WPF question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions740994usewpfobjecttopunchholeinanotherhttpstackoverflow.comquestions740994usewpfobjecttopunchholeinanothera, which has a much shorter writeup.p  pIve got a Class called codePunchOutShieldcode, which creates a Sprite that covers the stage or over some desired area.  The Sprites Graphics object is filled using the color and transparency of Flexs modal screen.  The result is a screen that looks like the screen which appears behind a modal PopUp.  p  pcodePunchOutShieldcode has a method called codepunchcode, which takes two arguments  the first is a Shape object, which defines the shape of the punchthrough area the second is a Point object, which indicates where to position the punchthrough area.p  pIt took some experimenting, but I found that I can successfully create a punchout area i.e.  the modal screen does not display within the bounds of the given Shape.  To do this,  I set codecacheAsBitmapcode to true on the Sprite that is used to create the modal screen, and also on the Shape object, which is added to the modal screen Sprites displayList.p  pIf I set the blend mode of the Shape to ERASE, a completely transparent area is created in the modal screen.  So far, great.p  pThe problem is that codeShapecode does not subclass InteractiveObject, so there is no way to set codemouseEnabled  falsecode on it.  And so, it prevents interaction between the mouse and any objects that are visible through the punchout area.p  pOn top of that, InteractiveObject isnt available to look at, so I cant see if there is a way to borrow what its doing to provide the codemouseEnabledcode functionality and apply it to a subclass of Shape.p  pIve tried using another Sprite object, rather than a Shape object, but the blending doesnt work out correctly.  Im not sure why there is a difference, but the Shape object seems to somehow combine with the parenting Sprite, allowing the ERASE blendMode to effect the desired punchout visual appearance.p  pIt wouldnt be the end of the world if I had to draw up the screen with a series of rectangles so that the punchout area was just simply not drawn, but that approach wont work if the punchout area is complex.  Or round.p  pAny thoughts on this approach, or on an alternative approachp

Negative 87680 pI am working on a Windows program codebase that has heretofore been 32bit. I am trying to make this codebase 64bit clean. Turning on top down allocations in the heap manager by setting the AllocationPreference registry value has been very helpful in turning up bugs where code was guilty of coercing pointers down to 32bit values such as ints and back, thus loosing the most significant half of the pointer values on x64.

Negative 87680 pBasically the idea is to use the same hibernate mapping files for two different underlying databases. In production the underlying database is MySQL5 and for testing purposes Id like to use Apache Derby  in order to avoid setting up and maintaining various MySQL databases for testing purposes. p  pI hoped that just switching the DataSources Driver and changing a few params would do the job, but Ive already run into some minor difficulties.

The mapping is as followsp  precode  ltproperty nameaboutgt     ltcolumn nameabout notnullfalse sqltypetextgtltcolumngt   ltpropertygt codepre  pDerby doesnt know the sqltype text so it refuses to create the table.

They do not have stagingQAtesting servers. yes this is not optimal. The data their apps consist of are images, xml files, user uploads and data in Sql Server. Having a few records, of their production database and a couple of dummy files is not a substitute of testing against real data in my opinion. How would you design a workflow that can create a acceptable environment to mimic a production environment before going livep  pstrongAnother Updatestrongp  pWhat Im still wondering is what tools, or procedures can you use to take a realistic snapshot of your production data files, database such that you can build your own Q amp A environment. The entire database and files relating to that are too large to copy entirely to the Q amp A server. But if you just copy the first couple of rows of each table, they might have no relation with each other and give random errors or unexpected behavior all over the place and does not reflect a realistic production database.p  pPS.

But if i remove FreeLibrary, in that case the DLLPROCESSDETACH case is executed implicitly and this time it gives error dialog box mentioning that there is access violation.p  pWhy calling FreeLibrary suppress this error OR internally it handles this exception What is suggested way.p  pUpdate I have added details for ATTACH and DETACH. Probably it will help why i am not clear about the behavior observed. With FreeLibrary call, i didnt get any error message but the cout message was not displayed. It seems crashed too but not being bnotified. But if i remove FreeLibrary, in that case the DLLPROCESSDETACH case is executed implicitly and gives access violation dialog box. Ideally in former case as well, it should display the error. So i am guessing the FreeLibrary suppresses this access violation error.p

Negative 87680 pI have a grid with one TemplateField which is a checkbox and say 2 bound fields.p  pIn PageLoad on postback I rebind the grid with cached dataset stored in session. If user selects checkbox on the grid, upon postback i can iterate on the grid and get those checked values, everything works fine.p  pIf I move the code of grid binding on postback to OnInit instead of PageLoad then i loose those user checked checkbox data. Why Should the postback data not overlay on top of the grid after oninit p  pIt does work with pageload, Im assuming that when i rebind the grid, Im overlaying my data on grid which has postback data, since the checkbox column is not bound i do not overwrite postback data.p  pNOTE viewstate is disabled on my grid, i bind data stored in session on everyback postback. Also something weird, when Im using OnInit, on every postback i get the first page of the grid, no matter which page the postback was triggered. Thanks.p

If they were bothp  pcodehttpwww.shotgunanddribble.comcode  codecmscodep  pcodehttpcrm.shotgunanddribble.comcode  codecrmcodep  pIs there any downside to using these kinds of rewrites  I think that, unless anyone else has any magical ideas, codesvnexternalscode is my only hope.p

Negative 87680 pFor quite some time now, Ive been fighting in vain to get a software Im working on to work under Windows. Its written in Python the 2.x series, and although all Linux users can benefit from its GUI when they use the source package, it seems that many people who download it go for the Windows package, for which Ive only been able to provide commandline binaries.p  pThe GUI was built using GladeGTK, and uses poppler to embed a PDF viewer. Ive found various howtos in the past I dont have them at hand right now, sorry, which Ive tried to follow religiously, but I never got things to work at all.p  pSo, is there a reliable tutorial explaining exactly how to install the needed libraries GTK and Poppler, so that I can build the corresponding binaries for my usersp

Negative 87680 pHas anyone ever heard of a general textual notation that can describe any IT system at any scale It should be something that is clearly defined, minimalistic, and can be applied recursively at any scale from website mashups, to network architecture, to software services, to multiple objects and threads inside one process. Something that starts with the basic concepts of storage, communication, and processing, and apply them at all levels.p  pIf such a notation exists, it could be used as the base for a DSL that could programmatically manage and monitor every and all part of a complex IT system. Then one would need only create a plugin for every system component, that expose its functionality into the DSL.p  pEDIT It looks like there is no such thing, or I didnt expressed myself clearly. So Ill tell you what I emwantem to do. I want to get into the website business, but for me, the fun part would be to collect data about everything that happens at all levels of the system, in a central database, and analyze that data to get insights into what is happening, to plan my next iteration. Therefore, I want a DSL that can represent any processstructure at any level, so that I can then programmatically access that data to gain insights. A Big Brother kind of thing. Since I want to do this in my new programming language of choice, Scala, something like Nagios or Zenoss Core wont help me much, IMHO.p

Negative 87680 pI have a distributed application which polls for commands from a central server and the content of those commands are signed by a private key with the public key deployed along with the application at each remote site. Each command is signed with the private key and that signature is verified before the command is executed.p  pHere is how I generate my publicprivate key pairs in java. emI realize, we should be doing more then 1024emp  precodeKeyPairGenerator keyGen  KeyPairGenerator.getInstanceDSA, SUN     SecureRandom random  SecureRandom.getInstanceSHA1PRNG, SUN keyGen.initialize1024, random KeyPair pair  keyGen.generateKeyPair codepre  pThe new requirement is that in addition to sending simple relatively safe commands, we now want to send commands which will instruct our software to download and execute an installer to update itself. This has the potential to open up a big hole if not done correctly. The execute update installer command will be signed as always and will also include the md5 of executable which will be downloaded and run. So, the signature on the command must be correct and will include the md5 and then calculated md5 on the downloaded file will need to be correct, before the execution will occur. This should take care of most attack vectors I can think of. strongAny others I should be concerned aboutstrongp  pSo, now I am directing my attention to securing the private key on the server where these commands originate. If that private key is obtained, it is game over. How should I secure that key on diskp  pMy thought is to use symmetric encryption with a passphrase to secure that private key.p  pMy current solution is as follows p  precodechar[] passphrase  Actual passphrase PrivateKey privateKeyObj  Actual Private Key byte[] privateKeyBytes  privateKeyObj.getEncoded  byte[] salt  new byte[8] new SecureRandom.nextBytessalt  SecretKeyFactory factory  SecretKeyFactory.getInstancePBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 KeySpec spec  new PBEKeySpecpassphrase, salt, 1024, 256 SecretKey tmp  factory.generateSecretspec SecretKey secret  new SecretKeySpectmp.getEncoded, AES  Cipher cipher  Cipher.getInstanceAESCBCPKCS5Padding cipher.initCipher.ENCRYPTMODE, secret AlgorithmParameters params  cipher.getParameters byte[] iv  params.getParameterSpecIvParameterSpec.class.getIV  byte[] ciphertext  cipher.doFinalprivateKeyBytes  FileOutputStream outputFileStream  new FileOutputStreamoutputFile outputFileStream.writesalt outputFileStream.writeiv outputFileStream.writeciphertext outputFileStream.close codepre  pemexceptions removed for clarityemp  pThis basically randomly generates a salt, uses passphrase to come up with key and then stores the resulting salt, IV and cipher text in a file ready for decryption. p  pHowever, I feel something is missing here. Like I should also somehow include some type of MAC on the key so that I know I get a valid description Maybe it is a simple as just putting 5 or 6 bytes of known text before the private key A bad passphrase right now just results in bad padding exception, but I read that this might not always be the case and some bad passphrases will decode and result in junk. I feel I need to guard against this.p  pCan someone let me know if I am on the right track here and provide some feedback. It is important that I get this as secure as possible..p

Occasionally, usually as the result of the Auto Complete feature, I will mistakenly send email from johndoedomainA.com to a recipient that should only be receiving mail from johndoedomainB.com.p  pThese restrictions between from my selected mail account and recipient To or CC email addresses can generally be defined by domain name.p  pFor example, johndoedomainA.com should not send to recipientdomainX.com amp recipientdomainY.com.

Negative 87680 pI want to use a custom ResourceProvider but still have the benefit of strongly typed resource names. It seems though that in my view if I access the resource property directly like sop  precodeHtml.RawUIText.Header codepre  pThen the text is read directly from the resx file and doesnt go through my custom provider factory which is defined in the web.config.p  precodeHtml.RawHttpContext.GetLocalResourceObjectUIText.resx, Header.ToString codepre  pWorks fine but has the downside of being stringly typed. I have created an extension method which wraps this but its still quite uglyp  precodeHtml.ResourceText gt UIText.Header codepre  pSo, is there a way to use the resource properties directly but have them route through a custom provider without having to create our own codeResXFileCodeGeneratorcodep

Negative 87680 pWere creating a highthroughput AMQP client using Qpid as the broker, and we are getting nowhere near the throughput reported in other places.  Were receiving under 250 msgs, while a hrefhttpbhavin.directi.comrabbitmqvsapacheactivemqvsapacheqpid relnofollowthis blog posta gets over 4 times that.  I fear the weak performance might be due to the fact that Qpid Python client libraries are in pure Python.  Does anyone know of a compiled Python AMQP library that is compatible with Qpid 0.7p  pstrongEdit 20110701strong Although Ive accepted zeekays answer, for Qpid they recently released SWIG bindings for their library.  Ive made a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseQPID3333 relnofollowpatchesa that make it a near dropin replacement for their pure Python client libraries.  After configuration changes which got us up to about 1000 msgssec, using the SWIG version got us to about 7000 msgssec.  Hopefully other Qpid users will find the bindings and my patches useful.p
Negative 87680 pIm trying to setup WCF Delegation, without success the scenario is Client  Frontend Server  Backend Server.p  pIn theory, this should be straight forward using Kerberos I do have a Windows Domain, but in practice Im running into weird errors with things like SSPI or even basic message security.p  pI found countless shallow resources, and forum posts where people had problems and were essentially just guessing solutions through trial and error. I looked at the Table of Contents at some socalled Pro and Expert WCF Books, but Delegation seems to be something no one wants to cover in fact, there is a typo in one of the Exceptions that .net throws that makes me feel not even Microsoft really bothers with it.p  pAnyway, is there any resource where someone that actually has a clue and the confidence to explain the whole process AZ, using a methodological approach with actual explanations and not just meaningless code blocks that dont work and are never explainedp
Negative 87680 pA C code retrieves a property value from a C dll and this retrieval blocks the current thread until the dll returns the value. In debug mode, when the retrieval takes a long time, the MDA throws a ContextDeadlockSwitch.p  pI suppose its not possible to catch ContextDeadlockSwitch at runtime, but is there a way that the a mechanism similar to MDA can throw a similar exception that C can catch to detect this deadlockp  pThe reason is to let C code prompt to the user to either continue waiting a few seconds more or forcibly kill and restart the app.p

Negative 87680 pIm having a lot of trouble with a query. I dont really know how to explain this well, but Im going to try.p  pBasically, we have several objects with a postedat field that keeps the date and time something was posted, with the time zone, in a datetime field. I need to query and get a range by date with those objects.p  pPreviously, I was converting that to Date and comparing it to another Date object. The query was something like thisp  precodeDatepostedat gt startdate AND Datepostedat lt enddate codepre  pHowever, when Postgre converted it to Date, it lost the timezone info which caused innacurate results to the query.p  pSo, I changed to thisp  precodeif startdate then     starttime  Time.zone.parsestartdate.yearstartdate.monthstartdate.day     conditions ltlt postedat gt start     hash[start]  starttime end  if enddate then     endtime  Time.zone.parseenddate.yearenddate.monthenddate.day.endofday     conditions ltlt postedat lt end     hash[end]  endtime end codepre  pWhile this gets me the accurate results, it also has horrible performance and is causing some timeouts in my application.p  pI couldnt find any other way to do this query and still keep the accurate results. Would anyone have some advice or ideasp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 87680 pI was hoping to use code.ajaxurlfoo.js, asyncfalse, dataTypescriptcode to block content display until foo.js had loaded.  The assumption was that synchronous script loading is roughly equivalent to codedocument.writecode.  Im guessing thats incorrect since I still get FOUC.  p  pWhile I can solve the immediate issue by hiding the element and showing it on script load, Im curious how the synchronous code.ajaxcode call differs from codedocument.writecode.  If you happen to know a way to get content blocking behavior from jQuery, that would be interesting also.p  pThanksp  pAdamp
Negative 87680 pFrom Day One I was told that each thirdparty iOS app was perfectly sandboxed and therefore there was no way for a thirdparty app to transfer messages other than some predefined urls to another app.p  pBut this emSend to Instagramem trick done by em100 Cameras in 1em just caught my attention. When the user triggers this action, he jumps from em100 Cameras in 1em to Instagram right away which is OK and could be easily implemented by the url trick mentioned above. However, what is interesting is that Instagram will display the image just processed by em100 Camera in 1em as if it was displaying a image from its own sandbox.p  pI understand that Cocoa Touch must have some APIs to support this. My question is, what are they Are they only limited to imagesp  pThanks a lot in advance.p  pstrongEditedstrong I understand theres the Cocoa Touch URL scheme thing, but if its the url scheme that did the trick...   the url scheme must contain info of a pointerreference to the image. Otherwise even if we jump from 100 Cameras in 1 to Instagram, Instagram wont have access to that image.p  pstrongEdited 2nd timestrong Though I havent tried yet, Tom Hs answer might finally led to a solution. So I accepted his answer as the final answer. As for unsets answer, unset kept mentioning the url scheme thing but dude, we all know that. And its not the switchingbetweenappsbycallingurl that confused us. Its how Instagram accessed that image from another app that confused us. Since unsets answer doesnt provide much useful info and never answered my question to the point, I downvoted his answer, and I suggest those who upvoted adjust your votes accordingly. strongStack Overflow is a great place because we could almost always have answers that are to the point, not because there are people whos answers are nothing wrong but are never really to the point.strongp  pstrongEdited 3rd timestrong a hrefhttpinstagram.comdeveloperiphonehooks relnofollowThe official Instagram developer pagea now gives the official solution.p  blockquote   pIf your application creates photos and   youd like your users to share these   photos using Instagram, you can use   the Document Interaction API to open   your photo in Instagrams sharing   flow.p      pYou must first save your file in PNG   or JPEG preferred format and use the   filename extension .ig. Using the   iOS Document Interaction APIs you can   trigger the photo to be opened by   Instagram. The Identifier for our   Document Interaction UTI is   com.instagram.photo, and it conforms   to the publicjpeg and publicpng   UTIs. See the Apple documentation   articles Previewing and Opening Files   and the   UIDocumentInteractionController Class   Reference for more information.p      pWhen triggered, Instagram will   immediately present the user with our   filter screen. The image is preloaded   and sized appropriately for Instagram.   Other than using the appropriate image   format, described above, our only   requirement is that the image is at   least 612px tall andor wide. For best   results, Instagram prefers opening a   JPEG that is 612px by 612px square. If   the image is larger, it will be   resized dynamically.p      pAn important note If either dimension   of the image is less than 612 pixels,   Instagram will present an alert to the   user saying we were unable to open the   file. Its our current policy not to   upscale or stretch images to our   minimum dimension.p blockquote

I cant seem to get the handler setup right to catch the confirm dialog.p  pHere is a test method I have been trying    p  precode    [TestMethod]     public void AddNewPostToRecordPublicNotOnBehalfNoSubNoNotifications              using var browser  new IEURL to the IFRAME                                      var approveConfirmDialog  ReturnDialogHandler.CreateInstance              var confirmCode  Guid.NewGuid             logon to CRM             logonToADFSbrowser              var recordPage  browser.PageltDiscussionRecordpagegt             recordPage.CreateNewPostButton.ClickNoWait              HtmlDialog dialog  browser.HtmlDialogFind.ByTitleNew Post             var messageText  dialog.TextFieldFind.ByClassrequired             messageText.TypeTextType some text.

I assume that I need to use the ReturnDialogHanlder.CreateInstance method for IE9 compatibility, but the standard ConfirmDialogHandler did not seem to work either.  Honestly, I dont know if I am using the dialog handler correctly in this case, but  I can click the ok buttons on other confirm dialogs that spawn from buttons on other pages.  This is a bit unique since it is spawning from a modal dialog instead of a page.p  pI also tried using this custom handler a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3454422cwatinaddanalertdialoghandlertoclickokbuttononeveryalertdialogwinC WatiN  Add an AlertDialogHandler to click ok button on every Alert dialog windowa with no results.p  pThanks in advance.p

As an example, the android application will accept the first button click event fine and fire the event but then the next fireEvent call activated by the next button press will not fire. p  pI know that the click event is firing, by placing an alert inside of each Event Listener, and that it has to be the fireEvent call.p  pI also know that it doesnt have anything to do with the order of the calls. If I change which event is fired first it will always fire the first one and it will always refuse the fireEvent calls that follow.

Negative 87680 pI have a project which uses Jersey 1.7, Guice 3.0 and has some JAXB annotated classes which are serialized through resources to XML and JSON.

Negative 87680 pI am a java developer learning Objective C for an IPhone  project, my question is about the OOP design in Cocoa.

Negative 87680 pI have a Single Page Application in which the browser does all the logic work.  Except for initial loading, the server is pretty much a fancy interface to the database.p  pThe browser sends data dictionary keys, column name  value pairs, and where clauses for SELECT, for example.  The server assembles the parts into SQL, executes the queries, and replies.  NEW In a SELECT, for example, the table name and columns pulled are from the data dictionary  the browser supplies the data dictionary key and the SELECT where clause.p  pThis very open environment is very susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.  The goal is to emprevent damageem from said attacks.p  h2Problems to be Overcomeh2  pFirst, as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7291630sqlinjectionhowtosanitizeprogramgeneratedsqlclausediscusseda, it is impossible to paramaterize a random SELECT codewhere clausecode  SELECT cannot use a prepared statements.p  pSecond, codemysqlicode, the library for paramaterized statements with MySQL, does not support NULL nor MySQL functions, eg, CURRENTDATE or NOW, as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7330744usingmysqlitopreventsqlinjectionhowtosetnullorcurrentdatediscusseda.p  h2Proposed Solutionh2  pFirst, if SELECT cannot be paramterized, then execute SELECT by a user who has no DML or DDL rights.  This will prevent SQL Injection Attacks from changing the database.p  pSecond, write a wrapper function for codemysqlicode that will allow NULL and MySQL functions to be passed as parameters.  This will allow parameters to be easily used for all DML.p  pThird, shadow highly sensitive data where it cannot be seen or touched by normal queries or normal users.  This will put sensitive data, such as passwords, out of the range of attacks.p  pForth, write a wrapper order to enforce the user  query type relationship.  This will ensure SELECT are executed by the codeselectcode user, for examplep  pThe result of that effort is a hrefhttpsgithub.combangkokmacoMySQLsqlinjectionprevention relnofollowherea.  The question is, logically, will this approach successfully protect against SQL Injection Attacksp  h2NonAnswer Answersh2  pI proposed this same question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7401852resqlinjectionattackusingmysqlwhatarebaselinerequirementsbeforea.

Negative 87680 pIve not had any luck searching for a solution to this, partly because Im not exactly sure how best to explain the problem Hopefully Im clear here but if not please feel free to ask for more info.p  pAt the top level In our database, each customer can have multiple services. Services are allocated to a customer individually. However, we need group services into packages of common service combinations for reporting purposes.p  pI have a database which contains package definitions  a table called packageServices, simply listing each PackageID with an associated ServiceID. Therefore I can retrieve a list of services for each package.p  pFrom the same database I can retrieve a list of ServiceIDs for a particular customer. p  pWhat I am trying to accomplish is to compare the list of ServiceIDs retrieved for that customer, and see if that combination matches any of the defined pacakges i.e. combinations of ServiceIDs and if so report which packages that customer has.p  pIm struggling to know where to begin so far as the comparison goes I guess I need to start by creating some sort of list of serviceIDs for each package rather than my current KeyValuePairs in the dictionary with multiple lines for each package then iterate through the packages and compare those lists of services with the list of services that customer hasp  pThe data types used here may not be most appropriate  in many cases Im referring to a logical list rather than a C List object  I can use whichever datatype is appropriate p  pAny help much appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrong  Its been suggested that I collate this information in SQL instead of in my C application. This seems like a good idea and one of the answers below has brought me close. However, there are business rules in place which determine whether a package is an upgrade of a lower package or a package in itself and this is seriously complicating things.p  pThe more I try to make this work the more I think that Ive bitten off more than I can chew I am emtryingem to design this properly, so that any changes to services or packages in the future will be handled easily  these changes are unlikely but possible. However, it would be much easier to just to hardcode the options from what Ive seen so farp  pstrongEDIT 2strong  Ive been working through this and it has been suggested that I assign a weight and a group to each package. The groups are there to ensure that a customer can only have one package from each group, and the weights are there to ensure that only the highest level package is returned. Using this in conjunction with MarceloCantos s query will mean that I should be able to return just the highest weight package from each group  this looks like it might fit the requirements of the applicationp  pThanks to all who have helped so far  Im amazed how quickly the responses started coming in and at the quality of the responses given. Ill give this a go and see how I get on.p

Negative 87680 pI have two Tomcat servers that need to maintain a persistent connection to cut down on SSL handshaking. One server the proxy sits in a DMZ while the other one is safely behind another firewall. The proxy basically just runs a simple servlet that does some sanity checking before forwarding requests over to the secure machine. On an intial request the machines exchange certificates before performing the real work. Therefore Id like to maintain a persistent connection with a timeout of a few minutes.p  pTo talk to the secure server, the servlet on the proxy uses codeHttpsUrlConnectioncode. Ive set up WireShark and Ive noticed that no matter what codekeepAliveTimeoutcode value I set for connector on the secure machine, the TCP connection gets closed after about 5 or 10 seconds. This number seems to match up with what Ive read is the default timeout and how Java handles HTTP KeepAlive. This a hrefhttpwebcache.googleusercontent.comsearchqcacheqNLXSxfa6oJbugs.sun.combugdatabaseviewbug.dobugid448712620ampcd1amphlenampctclnkampglus relnofollowlinka explains that Java honors the codeKeepAlivecode timeout if it is sent by the server, otherwise it uses 5 seconds direct connections or 10 seconds proxy connections before it closes the connection.p  pWhat Im trying to figure out is how can I force Tomcat to send the KeepAlive header. Not, codeConnection KeepAlivecode, but codeKeepAlive timeoutxcode.p  pIve experimented with Apache HTTP server and modifying the codekeepAliveTimeoutcode in httpd.conf does cause the KeepAlive header to change its timeout value. Furthermore Java does honor this timeout.p  pstrongUPDATE 122311strong After running a few more experiments I tried whipping up some quick and dirty code using Apaches HttpClient 3.1 rather than codeHttpsUrlConnectioncode. It appears that HttpClient, when set to use KeepAlive, simply waits for the server to close the connection. I dont know how long it will wait though. Im shooting to keep the HTTP connection alive for 3 to 5 minutes.p

Negative 87680 pIm using Silverlight, RIA and Entity Framework all .NET 4.0 for a business application.  The end goal is to use EF to build all the objects and map the CRUD operations in EF to stored procedures i.e. Insert, Update and Delete.  I have all this working with EF and RIA CRUD.  p  pThe issue that I am having is specific to the CreateInsert aspect of RIA Services.  When I dont have a Stored Procedure Mapped in EF, Silverlight client gets the updatedinserted Primary Key for the object after the async call to SubmtChanges completes, however when I use a mapped Stored Procedure, the Primary Key is never updated after the Insert. I have also tried explicitly calling the Store Procedure, but that doesnt effect it at all either. I am hoping I am just doing something wrong, or this is a known issue and therefore has a known workaround.p  pTo help illustrate the example I am talking about, I uploaded a sample app divided into two Parts through folders in both the Silverlight and web projects the Entity part represents using EF and LINQ like queries, and Stored represents utilizing EF objects with mapped Stored Procedures however only the CREATEINSERT method has a mapped SP.p  pThe fully working source can be downloaded at a hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comac2oj2n9ig8rywy relnofollowhttpwww.mediafire.comac2oj2n9ig8rywya and also includes a SQL script to create the DB, Table Street Abbri, and Store Procedures.

Negative 87680 pCurrently as a trail effect in my game I have for every 5 frames a translucent texture copy of a sprite is added to a Listlt of trails. p  pThe alpha values of these trails is decremented every frame and a draw function iterates through the list and draws each texture. Once they hit 0 alpha they are removed from the Listlt.p  pThe result is a nice little trail effect behind moving entities. The problem is for about 100 entities, the frame rate begins to drop drastically. p  pAll trail textures come from the same sprite sheet so i dont think its batching issue. I profiled the code and the CPU intensity is lower during the FPS drop spikes then it is at normal FPS so I assume that means its a GPU limitation p  pIs there any way to achieve this effect more efficientlyp  pHeres the general code im usingp  precode fade alpha malpha  intgameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds  10.0f   draw if malpha gt 0       p is used to alter RGB of the trails color mtint depending on alpha value     float p  floatmalpha255.0f     Color blend  new Colorintmtint.Rp, intmtint.Gp, intmtint.Bp, malpha                     draw texture to sprite batch     Globals.spriteBatch.Drawmtexture, getOrigin, mrectangle, blend, getAngle, new Vector2mrectangle.Width2, mrectangle.Height2, mscale, SpriteEffects.None, 0.0f                  else           flag to remove from Listltgt         misDone  true                 codepre  pI guess i should note, the mtexture given to the trail class is a reference to a global texture shared by all trails. Im note creating a hard copy for each trail.p  pEDIT If I simply comment out the SpriteBatch.Draw call, even when im allocating a new trail every single frame for hundreds of objects there is no drop in frames... there has got to be a better way to do this.p

Negative 87680 pcurrently I am using ListActivity. I use a cursor to get the data from SQL, and built the ListView according to the SQL query result. For every objects in my ListView, if I press that object onListItemClick, it will change the value in the SQL that the cursor will read, and open a new intent.Pressing on different object will change different value in the SQL table. To keep my ListView most updated, I usep  precodeadapter is the SimpleCursorAdapter I use protected void onListItemClickListView l, View view, int position, long id      super.onListItemClickl, view, position, id     change the data in sql     ...     change the data end     adapter.changeCursordbAdapter.getResultid     adapter.notifyDataSetChanged     create intent here     startActivityintent  codepre  pThe problem is, if I keep pressing the same object, leave the intent it create, it works fine. But once I press a different object after I leave the previous intent, my ListView becomes empty. For example, if I press object a, I enter intent a, and then I leave intent a, back to List View ListView is fine now, then I press on object b, I enter the intent b. When I leave intent b, the ListView becomes empty. Does anyone has any idea about this problem Thank you.p

Negative 87680 pI have an iOS application that Im just starting to implement game center support for.  I call the authenticateWithCompletionHandler method during loadView for my main root view controller.  My main view displays, and shortly later the sign in to game center dialog appears exactly as expected.  If Create New Account is selected, the game center New Account popover dialog displays in the middle of the screen this is on an iPad  but my underlying main menu disappears.  Underneath the popover dialog is just a black screen.  If I dismiss the dialog in the completion handler, it goes away as expected and my main menu comes back.p  pI figure this must be some sort of view hierarchy issue, and so to try to simplify the issue I created a new project.  Using Xcode 4.3.2 I modified a new Empty Application iOS project by adding a single view controller class, AppViewController.  I changed the system created AppDelegate.m file applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions method to set the rootViewController right after the window background color is set to whitep  precodeself.window.rootViewController      [[[AppViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil] autorelease] codepre  p...and I set the loadView method of AppViewController to load a view with a colored background so I could tell if it was properly compositing on top of it and then call the gamekit authentication methodp  precode void loadView      self.view  [[[UIView alloc] initWithFrame[UIScreen mainScreen].applicationFrame] autorelease]     self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor yellowColor]     GKLocalPlayer  localPlayer  [GKLocalPlayer localPlayer]     [localPlayer authenticateWithCompletionHandlernil]  codepre  pThis simple structure exactly mimics how I have my view hierarchy set up  a single UIViewController set as the window rootViewController which loads and manages a view heirarchy.  No XIB files.p  pAnyway, I get exactly the same behavior with this very simple test app.  When the New Account popover dialog appears, my underlying view in this case a yellow fill goes away and the underlying window white fill shows.  I assume this has to do with my misunderstanding of how iOS wants me to manage these controllers and views.p  pHowever, what is particularly odd at least to me is if I either cancel out of the New Account window or log in using an existing account and then immediately bring up the achievement popover dialog using presentModalViewController, that works  I can see my main menu view behind the achievement dialog.  Adding a simple button to the view and button press handler to the view controller showed the same thing  the achievements dialog shows the background view just fine, but New Account dialog obscures the underlying view.  Obviously, I would like the New Account dialog to look like its floating on top of my underlying view.  I should mention Im testing on iOS 5.1.p  pThanks for any help you might be able to give mep  pstrongUPDATEstrong After taking the advice of another stackoverflow post I purchased Beginning iOS 5 Development by Jeff LaMarche, David Mark, and Jack Nutting, and reviewed the section about starting from the Xcode Empty Application template.  This led me to modify my test code slightly.  emInsteadem of setting the rootViewController property directly, I am now doing this in applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsp  precodeUIViewController  viewController      [[[AppViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil] autorelease] viewController.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor yellowColor] [self.window addSubviewviewController.view] codepre  pI also got rid of the above loadView method on my view controller.  This works  Does anyone have any idea why  I dont see a substantive difference between the two systems.  In the first I guess I am emrecreatingem the view on the view controller there is no allocinit on the view controller view in the second system is there something special about the view that is automatically createdp  pstrongUPDATE x2strong OK, it looks like the real difference is in the linep  precode[self.window addSubviewviewController.view] codepre  pI thought setting the rootViewController on the window would automatically add the view to the window, but unless I do that explicitly, I get this odd behavior.  So I have found a work around for this issue, I just dont understand why it works.  Any ideas  Thanksp

An abstract class indicating there is a method which derived classes must implement, but they can change the type of object passed in as a parameter, so long as it is from the same inheritance chain...p  pWhat I have ended up doing, is to remove the abstract method codeAddProductcode from the abstract class, and instead just implementing it in the derived class anyway, but theres then no contract for other classes in the future that they must create their own implementation of codeAddProductcode. And it doesnt emfeel rightem.p  pI hope this makes sense. Apologies if this is a duplicate question but I couldnt find anything by searching.p  pThanks,br bgs264p

Negative 87680 pSo I was trying to follow a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmediacamera.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmediacamera.htmla to create a simple app that captures video and audio and saves the file to the sd card. and have succeed. with the help of pro android 4 pretty decent bookp  pHere is a github repo with the code a hrefhttpsgithub.comandroidAwesomeAndroidCamcorder relnofollowhttpsgithub.comandroidAwesomeAndroidCamcorderap  pWith the Help of Sam, Thanks again, I have a working copy of a camera app that can be customized. The documentation is kinda shaky, and I think it is missing a line in the prepareVideoREcorder method. There should be a mCamera.stopPreview before the mCamera.unlock is called. Hopefully with no luck you should be able to create an android project, add a class for the SurfaceView, then copy everything in here and have a working camcorder app that you can continue to customize p  pManifestp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     packagecom.camera123.cr     androidversionCode1     androidversionName1.0 gt      ltusessdk androidminSdkVersion8 gt      ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.CAMERA gt     ltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.camera gt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.RECORDAUDIO gt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE gt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.RECORDVIDEO gt      ltapplication         androidicondrawableiclauncher         androidlabelstringappname gt         ltactivity             androidname.Camera123             androidlabelstringappname               androidscreenOrientationlandscapegt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt                  ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt     ltapplicationgt  ltmanifestgt codepre  pcameraPreview.javap  precodepackage com.camera123.cr  import java.io.FileNotFoundException import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.io.IOException  import android.content.Context import android.graphics.Canvas import android.graphics.Color import android.graphics.Paint import android.hardware.Camera import android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback import android.util.Log import android.view.SurfaceHolder import android.view.SurfaceView  public class CameraPreview extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback      private SurfaceHolder mHolder     private Camera mCamera      public CameraPreviewContext context, Camera camera          supercontext         mCamera  camera           Install a SurfaceHolder.Callback so we get notified when the          underlying surface is created and destroyed.         mHolder  getHolder         mHolder.addCallbackthis          deprecated setting, but required on Android versions prior to 3.0         mHolder.setTypeSurfaceHolder.SURFACETYPEPUSHBUFFERS           public void surfaceCreatedSurfaceHolder holder           The Surface has been created, now tell the camera where to draw the preview.         try              mCamera.setPreviewDisplayholder             mCamera.startPreview          catch IOException e              Log.dDEBUG, Error setting camera preview   e.getMessage                      public void surfaceDestroyedSurfaceHolder holder             public void surfaceChangedSurfaceHolder holder, int format, int w, int h           If your preview can change or rotate, take care of those events here.

Negative 87680 pI have a method that is gobbling up 25 of my cpu time.  I call this method about 27,000 times per second.  Yup, lots of calls since its updating frequently.  I am wondering if anybody knows a faster way to detect if 2 polygons overlap.  Basically, I have to check the moving objects on the screen against stationary objects on the screen.  I am using PathGeometry and the two calls below are using up 25 of the cpu time used by my program.  The PointCollection objects I am passing just contain 4 points representing 4 corners of a polygon.  They may not create a rectangular area, but all the points are connected.

Negative 87680 pwe are using Akeeba Backup for backing up our Joomla website. It is possible to start a backup just by calling an URL as described here a hrefhttpswww.akeebabackup.comdocumentationquickstartguideautomatingthebackup.html relnofollowhttpswww.akeebabackup.comdocumentationquickstartguideautomatingthebackup.htmla. To automate the backup of our site we want to call this URL using a daily executed Cron job. Our web hoster supports the creation of Cron jobs, but you cannot use any shell scripts or something.

Negative 87680 pI use codetermmodecode to run Bash shells within Emacs. On remote hosts, codetermmodecodes directory tracking feature helpfully sets codedefaultdirectorycode to have the host name in it, so that tab completion and file access is done remotely via Tramp. Sometimes, however, I use remote hosts that mostly share the same filesystems as my workstation, as they load the same directories from NFS. In these cases, Tramp slows me down too much. I would like, when using these systems, for Emacs to set the codedefaultdirectorycode locally.

Negative 87680 pIm trying to create a function that moves images arranged in a radial layout around in a circle by swapping each ones position with their neighbors position. The final effect is that the images are rotating around in a circle. The transform is activated when the S counterclockwise or D clockwise keys are pressed. Im using an array to track the positions of the images and sending those coordinates to a function that actually does the transform. p  pThe first rotation in either direction works fine. But any consecutive rotation in the same direction produces strange unwanted movement. In essence, with every new rotation the images all move inward towards the center of the circle before moving out again to take their final positions. The amount of inward motion gets worse with each key press. p  pSince Im not allowed to attach an image to this email I have posted one here  a hrefhttpi1266.photobucket.comalbumsjj532ikalscreencap.jpg relnofollowhttpi1266.photobucket.comalbumsjj532ikalscreencap.jpgap  pThe image shows a series of screenshots to illustrate the phenomenon.

Negative 87680 pIve been learning OpenGL, and the one topic that continues to baffle me is the far clipping plane.  While I can understand the reasoning behind the near clipping plane, and the side clipping planes which never have any real effect because objects outside them would never be rendered anyway, the far clipping plane seems only to be an annoyance.p  pSince those behind OpenGL have obviously thought this through, I know there must be something I am missing.  Why does OpenGL have a far clipping plane  More importantly, because you cannot turn it off, what are the recommended idioms and practices to use when drawing things at huge distances for objects such as stars thousands of units away in a space game, a skybox, etc.  Are you expected just to make the clipping plane very far away, or is there a more elegant solution  How is this done in production softwarep

Therefore it uses the codePathcode to the file and the codeNamecode of the shader as the string key in the codeShaderListcode map is named.p  precodevoid ShadersObjectLoadFilestring Name, string Path      string FilePath  FolderPath  Path     ifstream StreamFilePath      ifStream.isopen              cout ltlt Loading Shader from  ltlt FilePath ltlt endl          string Output         Stream.seekg0, iosend            Output.reserveStream.tellg         Stream.seekg0, iosbeg         Output.assignistreambufiteratorltchargtStream,istreambufiteratorltchargt           this line doesnt compile         strcpyShaderList[Name].File, Output.cstr          else cout ltlt Can not load Shader from  ltlt FilePath ltlt endl  codepre  pI another method I want to use the value from codeShaderList[Name].Filecode to load and compile the shaders using codeglShaderSourcecode and codeglCompileShadercode. Where codeglShaderSourcecode needs a pointer to a codeconst GLcharcode holding the source code. In my case this would be codeampShaderList[Name].Filecode.p  pSome time ago I used codeShaderList[Name].File  Output.cstrcode instead of the line which doesnt compile now. The result was that only the pointer was saved in the codeShaderListcode and after the method exited the source code was gone. Thats why I tried using codestrcpycode but this function doesnt accept codeconst GLcharcode as parameter type.p  pstrongHow can I save the read file into my class memberstrongp
Negative 87680 pIm a fairly new programmer with some background in AS2, C, and Java. What I tried to do was begin creating a game in AS3 and simply consult Google when necessary, but there are some significant changes combined with my inexperience that are making things difficult.p  pBasically, I have a gridlayout successfully working where you can control a movieclip on the grid and within the bounds. I also implemented a 2DArray class to create an array that could mimic the board and store information like There is already a character at position 5,4 so you cannot move your character there. It just stores 0s and 1s.p  pWhat Im lost at is how to correctly manage the movieclips I created in my library so they could be placed on the stage and be handled by alreadywritten code. By this I mean it would be fantastic to add a movieclip and have an event handler updating my 2D array to say that location has been filled now. As well as add some AI movement to it that I maybe had a class for.p  pSo in a nutshell, I was wondering if anyone had either some quick tips or tutorials that could help me get the ball rolling again.p  pThanksp  pMikep

When the user clicks delete the category is removed and then I want to rearrange the category divs so that the rows are filled from the top down. p  pTo give an example If the user clicks the delete that is labeled by the comment in the html above then I want to reshuffle the category divs so that the top row has three category divs in and the second row only has two in  this needs to work for any number of rows.p  pI have tried a few things but am not getting anywhere  I feel like I am missing some essential principle of DOM manipulation.p  pI have tried collecting all the category divs up as one object and then wrapping them in the relevant row tags but I get lots of DivElement does not have XXX property errors. I have tried rebuilding the html from scratch but then I get lots of nasty event handler .bind problems as I said, this is a simplified sample.

Negative 87680 pThis probably doesnt even need asking, but I want to make sure Im right on this.  When you create an array of any object in Java like sop  precodeObject[] objArr  new Object[10] codepre  pThe variable codeobjArrcode is located in stack memory, and it points to a location in the heap where the array object is located.  The size of that array in the heap is equal to a 12 byte object header  4 or 8, depending on the reference size bytes  the number of entries in the array.  Is this accuratep  pMy question, then, is as follows.  Since the array above is empty, does it take up 12  410  52 bytes of memory in the heap immediately after the execution of that line of code  Or does the JVM wait until you start putting things into the array before it instantiates it  Do the null references in the array take up spacep

Instead only something like a hrefhttppostimage.orgimagejk9swfr2t relnofollowhttppostimage.orgimagejk9swfr2ta is rendered.  I spent a very long time to search for a solution but it always ultimately turned out to be impossible due to Word based Outlook HTML render engine.p  pOur C addin code repository is extremely large and is legacy  I am not a c developer and dont know to much about COM and c outlook corresponding APIs, the target is to rewrite  according to existing functionalities, there is simply no time and no resources to analize legacy code.p  pBut the most interesting to me is that c version of software render everything inputs, checkbox, select option, just everything So I guessed it is possible and started looking for a workaround or any kind of hack.p  pI analyzed the old c addin using OutlookSpy tool and it turned out that it doesnt fill HTMLBody. I had to wade through a partial legacy code and found that it set PRHTML MAPI property. Unfortunately I found also that this property is not available in vsto so I cant check if it helps.p  pSo  my questions arep  ul lido you know any hacks to render HTML forms in Outlook using VSTOli liare there any differences using item.HTMLBody or PRHTML MAPI property which can have impact on my problem li liif yes then can I set PRHTML using C Ive checked free a hrefhttpwww.addinexpress.comcreatingaddinsblog20081121outlookobjectmodelpropertyaccessorstorageitem relnofollowhttpwww.addinexpress.comcreatingaddinsblog20081121outlookobjectmodelpropertyaccessorstorageitema but it doesnt work for me  code doesnt execute when I add AddExpress.MAPI.dllli ul  pEverything must be done programmatically so inserting using Outlook UI or exporting to Outlook from IE doesnt count.

Negative 87680 pIm doing interprocedural dataflow analysis with clang. Currently Im using libtooling to parse source files and call AST visitor. The question is how do I create a single AST for several .c filesp  pIve tried to use ASTImport class, but it does not support import of some AST nodes. Moreover, Im doing something wrong when I create and manipulate CompilerIstance and it crashes in destructor.p  pA very similar option was ASTImportAction but its not quite clear to me which commandline parameters should be passed to the ClangTool in this case.p  pThe third option was to create ASTUnits for every .c file and to look for definitions in each of them its not clear how to find correspondence between userdefine types, e.g. records. In ASTImport they use IsStructurallyEquivalent function but its declared in anonymous namespace so I can only copy all this code into my program. And again it supports not all AST nodes.p  pFrom the internet this link a hrefhttplists.cs.uiuc.edupipermailcfedev2012August023865.html relnofollowhttplists.cs.uiuc.edupipermailcfedev2012August023865.htmla seems to be most appropriate but for me the technical details of the solution are not clear.p  pAny suggestions are welcome.

Negative 87680 pSome programmers argue that it is better to pass codeIEnumerableltTgtcode parameters over passing implementations like codeListltTgtcode, and one of the popular reasons to do this is that the API is immediately usable in more scenarios because more collections will be compatible with codeIEnumerableltTgtcode than any other specific implementation, e.g. codeListltTgtcode.p  pThe more I dive into multithreaded development scenarios, the more I am starting to think that codeIEnumerableltTgtcode is not the correct type either and I will try to explain why below.p  pHave you ever received the following exception while enumerating a collectionp  pstrongCollection was modified enumeration operation may not execute.strong an InvalidOperationExceptionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMy0Y0.png altCollection was modified exceptionp  pBasically what causes this is, you are given the collection on one thread, while someone else modifies the collection on another thread.p  pTo circumvent the problem, I then developed a habit to take a snapshot of the collection before I enumerate it, by converting the collection to an array inside the method, like thisp  precodestatic void LookAtCollectionIEnumerableltintgt collection         foreach int Value in collection.ToArray  take a snapshot by converting to an array               Thread.SleepITEMDELAYMS       codepre  pMy question is this. strongWouldnt it be better to code towards arrays instead of enumerables as a general rulestrong, even if it means that callers are now forced to convert their collections to arrays when using your API p  pIs this not cleaner and more bulletproof the parameter type is an array insteadp  precodestatic void LookAtCollectionint[] collection         foreach int Value in collection              Thread.SleepITEMDELAYMS       codepre  pThe array meets all the requirements of being enumerable and of a fixed length, and the caller is aware of the fact that you will be operating on a snapshot of the collection at that point in time, which can save more bugs.p  pThe only better alternative I can find right now is the IReadOnlyCollection which will then be even more bullet proof because the collection is then also readonly in terms of itemcontent.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pDanielPryden provided a link to a very nice article a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20080922arraysconsideredsomewhatharmful.aspx relnofollowArrays considered somewhat harmfula.

Negative 87680 pI build a Viewcontroller with a TableView for iPhone. Now i try to generate the same content but sorted in a kind of grid. It should be 3 x 3. I generated quads with a measure of 220px x 220px and also set the width of my TableView to 220. p  pTo generate the grid I thought about inserting two more Tableviews which will get 3 specified cells. The problem is just, that I have the method cellForRowAtIndex in my ViewController and I cant insert the cell into the tableview I want. I found a method that is calledp  precode[self.channelTableView2 insertRowsAtIndexPaths0                                   withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic] codepre  pBut this seems to be the method that adds a new row into a tableview when youre in edit mode.p  pI also thought about creating a condition that will set 3 specific columns into each tableview but for me it seems like the method cellForRowAtIndexPath is just for one TableView and you cant specify anything inside it.p  pDoes anybody know a way how to solve this Problem I also saw other posts where a grid has been created but I cant use the old code if I create a new View instead of a new UITableViewCell. And I heard about the Collection View but it is just supported by devices with iOS 6.p

Note  I removed some code that refreshes the grid in order to simplify the code I posted.  However, where I have the codeconsole.logcode statements are where I am tracking what is supposed to happen.  p  pAll the examples of jqGrid I have seen thus far deal with editing the data, which I am not doing. I believe I am doing something wrong in the custom formatter, but I do not know what.  I would appreciate any help or suggestions as to how resolve this or how I am going about this incorrectly.  p  pThanksp

Negative 87680 pI have a Django application with views which I hope to profile with a hrefhttppythonhosted.orglineprofiler relnofollowlineprofilera or similar linebyline profiling methods. I have successfully tested lineprofiler on other python scripts, but have not figured out the best way to do so on Django views. All of the views I have created are initiated by MATLAB url requests and are thus difficult to debug. What I need is some way of wrapping the views such that when a request is made lineprofiler will create a statistics file for later viewing right now, the only way I have figured out how to use lineprofiler is through explicit calls to a script with kernprof.py in the terminal  perhaps simulating an http request at this step would work, but none of my attempts in this vein have succeeded.. If anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated  p

Negative 87680 pimg srchttpi39.tinypic.com6qeh3r.png altsample imagep  pIntro The whole metrics table you see here is a view within a metrics viewcontroller. There is a nearly identical table below in green doesnt get displayed properly as you can see. The red area and green area are actually just container UIViews for the viewcontrollers views.p  pThe problem I must use autolayout for my project. The size of these tables is dynamic vertically. It is my understanding that autolayout should be able to determine height automatically for UIViews using intrinsicContentSize as opposed to me manually constraining heights. The actual best height of the table in this example is 192. However, when calling sizeThatFits, it returns 405 on the viewcontrollers view. After hooking up the more button to a test method, I found that by calling sizeThatFits on the subviews of the viewcontrollers view, it properly returns a sum of 192. So, I can at least manually constrain the height by using a method to determine the sizeThatFits on the subviews, right..p  pUnfortunately, this sizeThatFits method only seems to be able to work once the view has totally loaded on the screen which explains why it works when using the more button test method. If I attempt to manually determine the sizeThatFits automatically when the view loads, it returns 0 for all views. There seems to be an issue Im not familiar with when it comes to the order of views loading or something. At what point does this method actually workp

Negative 87680 pI have a model that could be owned by many other models It has many foreign keys.p  pIm going to try to make a polymorphic function on this model, that will behave depending on who its owner is.  Unfortunately Im not sure what the active record code would be to find that out, and when I go in binding.pry the self object doesnt have any information I can tell.p  pSo a good example would be Company and Person both have a Tax IDp  pWhen the Tax ID model is going to do something, it wants to know who its owner is.  Makes sensep  pMy actual relationship is a hasmany, but I doubt that is the sticking point.p

Negative 87680 pSo, I created a Spring Maven Project, a Dao Project, which works great.  All the code is in the correct place, all the unit tests run, and I can do a mvn clean install.  I can see in the target directory that there is a build jar, and everything in it looks fine.  I can also confirm that when I check my local .m2repository, the latest jar I just built is in there.p  pHere is a small segment of that pom.xmlp  precodeltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt ltgroupIdgtcom.tom.myprojectltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtmyprojectdaoltartifactIdgt ltversiongt0.0.1SNAPSHOTltversiongt ltpackaginggtjarltpackaginggt ltnamegtMy Project DAOltnamegt codepre  pNow, I am creating a new Spring Maven WebProject for my UI, and this pom.xml starts out likep  precodeltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt ltversiongt0.0.1SNAPSHOTltversiongt ltgroupIdgtcom.tom.myprojectltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtmyprojectwsltartifactIdgt ltnamegtMy Web Projectltnamegt ltpackaginggtwarltpackaginggt codepre  pAlso in this pom.xml file, one of the first dependencies I have isp  precode    lt My DAO ProjectDependencies gt     ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtcom.tom.myprojectltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmyprojectdaoltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt0.0.1SNAPSHOTltversiongt         lttypegtjarlttypegt         ltscopegtcompileltscopegt     ltdependencygt codepre  pI can see in eclipse that when I try to access the classes from this dao jar, that seems to work fine.  When I compile the code here, that all works fine.  And when I do a mvn clean install to build this war, I can see the target directory, and all the needed classes and jars come in, obviously there are hibernate, logging, and spring classes that are there in the WEBINFlib directory.p  pNow this is he part where the question comes in ... Why does the myprojectdao show up under WEBINFlib as WEBINFlibmyprojectdao0.0.1SNAPSHOT.jar but appears as a directory, and not a jarp  pCertainly when I pull in other jars, they are just .jar files and not directories.p  pI should add, when you look in the Eclipse project under maven dependencies, the icon for all the other jars show them as files.   The icon for my myprojectdao.jar uses the icon for a folderdirectory, so clearly a directory named myprojectdao.jar is being created and not a file with zipped up contents into a jar file.p  pWhen I build the war file, and deploy the war, the app says it cannot find any of the classes in the myprojectdao.jar directory.  I have to delete the FOLDER myprojectdao.jar from the WEBINFlib directory and manually copy over the FILE myprojectdao.jar.  I can then clearly see the icon that means this really is a file.p  pThis is probably a simple fix, so if you can help me out, that would be great.p  pANSWERp  pI wasnt using the mavenassemblyplugin.  But, I did find out what the problem is.p  pBoth my DAO project and the WEB project are in the same workspace, and the DAO project was open, as a result, the maven dependency shown in Eclipse was a folder icon, and not the jar icon.   When I closed the DAO project and looked back at the maven dependencies on the WEB project pom.xml file ... NOW it shows the icon as a jar and not a folder.p  pSo, all I have to do build my dao.jar file with maven, and when it is successful, it is done. Then I have to CLOSE the project within Eclipse. In my web project pom.xml file, the icon will now show this as a jar file, and when it builds, it will pull in the jars.p  pI imagine this is a benefit if one is working on several prior project, you really do have the chance to look at what is in the jar file while the war is running.   p  pIn my case, I know my dao.jar is working, so I can build it, and close the project, and then make use of that jar anywhere I need it.p

Negative 87680 pFirst of all Im really sorry if im asking a Dumb Question. But unfortunately i cant find out a way to take inputs for my salesforce Application. strongI am developing a simple CV Management app, but i cant figure out how to interact usersinput data to the App I have created Candidate Custom object, and manually i can create the Candidates, but my requirement is to create records by Candidates themselves.strongp  pI followed SalesForce Tutorials and i found out a way to display data using VisualForce Custom Pages. But what i want to Heading  do is when i giving a link to the user, he can go to that link and there having form to fill with his personal data, and submit only. But im just confused how to user input data map with our Custom Candidate object fields.  when im searching i saw some FormAssembly and Custom VisualForce Pages. But Problem is I dont hope to use any 3rd party apps. p  pstrongTutorials says thatstrongp  blockquote   pIn the past, to make Force.com data available to the general public, you had to set up a Web   server, create custom Web pages JSP, PHP, or other, and use the API to integrate Force.com   apps with an external website. This is no longer the case, thanks to Sitesp blockquote  pPlease if you can, help me Friends, Really Appreciate it amp Thank you soo much.. p
Negative 87680 pIm in a situation where I have 4 groups of 7 threads each. My CPU core i7 is supposed to be able to handle 8 threads, so Im considering going through each group one at a time, running the 7 threads, then moving to the 2nd group, running its 7 threads, then 3rd and 4th groups in the same way, and then starting back at 1st group, until user sends a stop command.p  pMy question is, once each group of 7 threads has finished processing, should I keep those threads idle, or shut them down completely and restart a new group of 7 threads at the next iteration Which method will be faster This is for a very speed intensive app, so I need everything to happen as quickly as possible.p  pI will be using a codeFixedThreadPoolcode to manage each group of 7 threads. So I could either just codeinvokeAllcode and then leave them alone presumably to idle, or I could codeshutdowncode each threadpool after the codeinvokeAllcode and start a new threadpool at the next iteration.p  pWhich method will be fasterp

Negative 87680 pI had some code and it used to work fine, now it doesnt anymore. I have a set of results, displayed in a GridPanel and I have a textfield to filter the results. When there is more than 3 letters entered, it will filter the display results accordingly. There is a listener in the textfield that will react to values being entered. Once something has been entered, it fires the following commandsp  precodegrid   Ext.getCmpshopGrid console.loggrid store  grid.getStore console.logstore  if strLen gt 3      store.filterNAME, input, true, false   else      store.clearFilter     store.load  codepre  pI have added console.log to see whats going on. I get the grid put out into the console and its an object with all kinds of elements, just a I would expect. It doesnt go any furhter though and terminates with the error message TypeError Ext.getCmp....getStore is not a functionp  pI have encountered this kind of error message before, but I dont fully understand what its trying to tell me yet, as my understanding of the inner workings of Javascript is rather limited. Within ExtJS the function getStore is only defined for GridPanels. Could my problem be that getCmp serves me with a standard object rather then a GridPanel But then there is only one type of object within Javascript, right Anyways, Im using Ext Version 3.4.1. Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 87680 pI am trying to plot multiple lines in a 3D plot using matplotlib. I have 6 datasets with x and y values. What Ive tried so far was, to give each point in the data sets a zvalue. So all points in data set 1 have z1 all points of data set 2 have z2 and so on. Then I exported them into three files. X.txt containing all xvalues, Y.txt containing all yvalues, same for Z.txt. p  pHeres the code so farp  precode        usrbinpython         from mpltoolkits.mplot3d import axes3d         import matplotlib.pyplot as plt         import numpy as np         import pylab          xdata  X.txt         ydata  Y.txt         zdata  Z.txt          X  np.loadtxtxdata         Y  np.loadtxtydata         Z  np.loadtxtzdata          fig  plt.figure         ax  fig.addsubplot111, projection3d         ax.plotwireframeX,Y,Z         plt.show codepre  pWhat I get looks pretty close to what I need. But when using wireframe, the first point and the last point of each dataset are connected. How can I change the colour of the line for each data set and how can I remove the connecting lines between the datasetsp  pIs there a better plotting style then wireframep

Then when I click on any of the node, I go and retrieve the childrenin JSON format of that particular node based on its id and its type. jsTree appends the hierarchies successfully on the browser but it fails to acknowledge that the clicked node is a parent of the loaded nodes Logically I would expect this because I didnt tell jsTree to do so. So, now my questions comep  p1 How do I dynamically make this clicked node as a parent of those loaded nodes.p  p2. I have to double click on the node for jsTree to load the corresponding children. How do I do that in just a single clickp  pThanks in advance.p  pHere is my code codep  precode   In the Servlet, I have the following conditional statements             iftype.equalsroot                         String jsonString  TreeTest.getRoot.getStringdata             out.writejsonString                        else iftype.equalsrig                          String jsonString  TreeTest.getSecondHierarchyInteger.parseIntid.getStringdata              out.writejsonString                        else iftype.equalswell                          String jsonString  TreeTest.getThirdHierarchyInteger.parseIntid.getStringdata              out.writejsonString               codepre  pThe JSONObject which I am returning for every call is in the form of p  pdata              data  nodename,              attr id nodeid,  type  nodetype          p  hr  precode        Here is my jsTree codes             document.readyfunction                tree.jstree                       themes theme classic,                       core                                strings                                  loading  Loading data...                                                      ,                       jsondata                         ajax                         type GET,                        url TreeViewServlet,                         data functionn                                                  return                              id  n.attr  n.attrid  0,                             type n.attr n.attrtype root                                                                                            ,                   types                    types                        rig                           icon                               image  .imagesRig.gif                                              ,                     well                           icon                               image  .imagesWell.gif                                              ,                      assysystype                           icon                               image  .imageswhxt.gif                                              ,                     assy                           icon                               image  .imagesAssy.gif                                              ,                   DrlWH                       icon                           image  .imageswicon.gif                                      ,                  ComplXT                       icon                           image  .imagesxicon.gif                                      ,                  subAssy                      icon                           image  .imagessubass.gif                                                                          ,                plugins  [themes,jsondata,ui, core, types]               .delegate.jstreeopengta, click.jstree, functionevent                                                    .jstree.referencethis.closenodethis,false,false                         .delegate.jstreeclosedgta, click.jstree, functionevent                                                    .jstree.referencethis.opennodethis,false,false                                              codepre

Negative 87680 pIn my form application i added an adobe reader control to show pdf files IN my application. I have a split panel, so on the left is a tree view with directories and files. And on the right side i have the adobe reader control. Works good. p  pBut i want to implement some keyevents while the focus is on the adobe reader control. I search around the whole day withound find a solution that works.p  pI also tried to override the ProcessCmdKeyEvent, but it didnt work too. The Event isnt called, when the focus is on the adobe reader control. The Event is calld, if the focus are on the form or at the tree view. No error was displayd or in the console. Also tested with an breakpoint.p  pSo, is there something you know and I dont Your suggestions are very welcome.  Thanks.p
Negative 87680 pWe are looking for a solution to consume a REST full service dynamically in C. It is something like Wcf test client. In our application, user should be able to provide a service url and then select the required data to be used in the application.p  pNormally, we will get the WSDL in case of SOAP based service, that describes all about the service, like available methods, parameters to be passed, response type, etc. We, then can use the response, probably using reflection if we execute it dynamically. p  pHow can we achieve the similar information if the services are RESTfull How do we know what type of data it returns What is the schema etc.p  pI found something called WADL and RSDL can be used to know about the RESTfull services. Do all the REST full services always provide that If so then how If not then how will I get to know about the servicesp  pPlease note that in our application, we want our user to register any RESTfull service at runtime and consume the response in the application, so we dont want to code for each type of services.p  pWCF support dynamic discovery in case SOAP. Does it support something similar for REST p

Negative 87680 pWhen helping someone, I had an interesting situation.

Later I learned browsers scope all HTML elements globally.p  pSo explaining how this problem is solved is by myElem will be in scope as a JQuery object within the on load function, however the JQuery object will become outofscope when it is inside myProblem method and, because browsers scope all HTML elements globally, myElem will be scoped as a HtmlInputElement.p  pI have been writing code for awhile, and for me to just learn browsers are scoping all HTML elements globally was news to me.p  pI understand the code sample and why it works. My question is how early have browsers been doing this Is this a latest trend or have I missed something Do all browsers support thisp  pAfter some research, I found the latest browsers support, but how about IE6, etc.p  pThank youp

Negative 87680 pin my Neo4j 2.0 server database I have a forest, i.e. a set of trees. One of my use cases is to get the child nodes of an arbitrary subset of tree nodes.p  pFor instance, I have the root nodesp  precoderoot1 root2 root3 root4 codepre  pand now I want the child nodes of coderoot1code and coderoot4code. bAnd I need to know which children belong to which rootb. Each query individually is a simple MATCH Cypher query. But for the sake of performance I would like to keep the amount of database calls low since I use the Neo4j server. Thus I am thinking about a way to tell Cypher give me the child terms of root1 and root4 and tell me which node belongs to which root in the result. That is, I think of a kind of map. Or a collection of result sets where the first element is the child nodes of the first root, the second element the child nodes of the second root etc.p  pIs there a way to do this in Cypher or will I have to fall back to a server plugin herep  pThank you and best regardsp  pbEditbp  pTo clarify My main concern is that I need to know which children belong to which root. As an example, consider the small graph generated by this commandp  precodecreate r1ROOT nameroot1, r2ROOT nameroot2, c11CHILD namechild11, c12CHILD namechild12, c13CHILD namechild13, c21CHILD namechild21, c22CHILD namechild22, c23CHILD namechild23, r1[HASCHILD]gtc11, r1[HASCHILD]gtc12, r1[HASCHILD]gtc13, r2[HASCHILD]gtc21, r2[HASCHILD]gtc22, r2[HASCHILD]gtc23 codepre  pHere, we get coderoot1code and coderoot2code with three children, respectively.p  pTo get the children of coderoot1code I would issue the following queryp  precodeMATCH rROOT[HASCHILD]gtc where r.nameroot1 RETURN collectc codepre  pNow I know the children of root coderoot1code. The question is How would a query look like that queries the children of coderoot1code AND coderoot2code where the result would show the association of which child belongs to which root. Because clearly the queryp  precodeMATCH rROOT[HASCHILD]gtc where r.nameroot1 OR r.nameroot2 RETURN collectc.id codepre  pwould give me the children of both roots. But now I would not know which root had which children. So what can I dop

Negative 87680 pI am working on a project that uses requirejs to dynamically load modules from a web browser. Some of the modules are vendor files, e.g. jQuery, which are all installed into a folder codeprojectrootlibcode via bower. This projects modules are located in a folder codeprojectrootcomponentscode. So I have a requirejs config, codecomponentsmain.jscode, that looks something like thisp  precode  requirejs.config     baseUrl components,     paths        jquery libjqueryjquery,         codepre  pThis way, when a vendor module is requested, require finds it by using the mappings defined in codepathscode, while all other modules are located relative to codecomponentscode.p  pI also want to use r.js to perform concatenation and minification and reduce all javascript files to simply codeapp.jscode for use in production. I was able to successfully perform this task with coder.js o build.jscode. Here is what codebuild.jscode looks likep  precode     baseUrlcomponents,     out    jsapp.js,     name   app,     paths        jquery ..libjqueryjquery       codepre  pHowever, because there are dozens of vendor file paths defined in my require.js config codemain.jscode, I dont want to have to replicate the configuration across two different files. I would rather use a single config file. The problem is that the paths defined in codemain.jscode are absolute codelib...code, codecomponentscode, because theyre URL paths, but the paths in codebuild.jscode need to be relative code..lib...code, code.componentscode, because theyre filesystem paths. Is there a way to reconcile these differences and define the paths only in codemain.jscode, which I then I load in using codemainConfigFilecode in codebuild.jscode I tried using the require config called codemapcode in codebuild.jscode, but this method required that I defined a new mapping for each module, which is just as bad as redefining all of the paths. I want a blanket mapping, essentially.p  pIs there a method to consolidate my config files to avoid duplicate path definitionsp

Negative 87680 pIve implemented a sliding menu nav using SWRevealViewController which works great. I was able to easily make it so i could swipe right to see the menu by adding this line to my     p  precode[self.view addGestureRecognizerself.revealViewController.panGestureRecognizer] codepre  pThe menu nav would then show up on the left side of the screen my main view controller would move to the right. However I am unable to swipe the screen back  I am forced to tap on the main screen to have it move back hiding the menu nav in the process. Is there an easy way to implement thisp
Negative 87680 pIm building a form that can add extra fieldsets and inputs. I am trying to get the fieldsets and inputs to have an individual ids and names such as fenceDescription2, fenceDescription3 but I cant figure out how to have the new element for either the fieldset or the inputs call on its own name so that it can add a new number to it. I got it to work with just one field but cant get the names to and the newNum correctly when I have multiple fieldsets. Ideally every time you clicked add new fence a clone of the elements would pop up underneath, each with a matching newNumber that corresponds to their order in the form fenceHeight2 with postQuantity2 and postMeasurement2, and then 3 with 3, etc.  Any help explaining how this is done would be greatly appreciated Thanks Here is a JSFiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgv00293dnNP1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netgv00293dnNP1ap  pHTML  p  precode    ltfieldset idfencegt     ltdiv idinputFence1 classclonedInputFencegt         ltfieldset idfenceDescriptongt             ltlegendgtltstronggtFence Descriptionltstronggt              ltlegendgtFence Description             ltselect namefenceHeight idfenceHeightgt                 ltoption valueselectgtSelect Fence Heightltoptiongt                 ltoption value6 idfH6gt6 Ft.ltoptiongt                 ltoption value8 idfH8gt8 Ft.ltoptiongt             ltselectgt         ltfieldsetgt          ltfieldset idpostgt             ltlegendgtltstronggtPost Typeltstronggt              ltlegendgt              ltlabelgtPost Quantity                 ltinput typepostQuantity namepostQuantity idpostQuantity value gt             ltlabelgt             ltselect namepostMeasurements idpostMeasurementsgt                 ltoption valueselectgtSelect Post Measurementsltoptiongt                 ltoption value238 x .065 x 8 id238 x .065 x 8gt2 38 x .065 x 8ltoptiongt                 ltoption value238 x .095 x 8 id238 x .095 x 8gt238 x .095 x 8ltoptiongt             ltselectgt         ltfieldsetgt      ltdivgt ltfieldsetgt     ltdivgt         ltinput typebutton idbtnAddFence valueAdd Another Fence gt         ltinput typebutton idbtnDelFence valueRemove Fence gt     ltdivgt codepre  pJSp  precode Dynamic Fence Input Fields         btnAddFence.clickfunction                      var num      .clonedInputFence.length  how many duplicatable input fields we currently have                     var newNum   new Numbernum  1       the numeric ID of the new input field being added                  create the new element via clone, and manipulate its ID using newNum value                 var newElem  inputFence  num.clone.attrid, inputFence  newNum                  Fieldset creation                 newElem.findfieldset.attrid, name  newNum                  Fence Description                  newElem.findselect[namefenceHeight].attrid, fenceHeight  newNum.attrname, fenceHeight  newNum                   Post Type                 newElem.findinput[namepostQuantity].attrid, postQuantity  newNum.attrname, postQuantity  newNum                 newElem.findselect[namepostMeasurements].attrid, postMeasurements  newNum.attrname, postMeasurements  newNum                     insert the new element after the last duplicable input field                 inputFence  num.afternewElem                   enable the remove button                  btnDelFence.removeAttrdisabled                   business rule you can only add 5 names                 if newNum  5                     btnAdd.attrdisabled,disabled                           btnDelFence.clickfunction                  var num  .clonedInputFence.length  how many duplicatable input fields we currently have                 inputFence  num.remove      remove the last element                   enable the add button                 btnAdd.attrdisabled,                 btnAddFence.removeAttrdisabled                   if only one element remains, disable the remove button                 if num1  1                     btnDelFence.attrdisabled,disabled                           btnDelFence.attrdisabled,disabled           codepre
Negative 87680 pIm currently facing a  I think  very common networking problem. But I cant find an answer with SpriteKit.p  pLets take a simulation with a ball that bounce again wall. The objective is to synch the ball position on two devices via bluetooth or Wifi.p  ul liIt uses codeSpriteKitcode physics to simulate ball movement and collisionsli liIt uses codeMultipeerConnectivitycode for networking on bluetooth or Wifi.li liThe Device A  master  simulates everything and tells ball position and vector to Device B at synchronisation points. The Device B simulates the scene between synch points.li ul  pCurrently, the ball in Device B is always 50ms later than device A. To prevent this, someone told me about interpolation  Device B receive the DeviceAs ball position and knows the info is 50ms old. So Device B should be able to predict the real position 50ms after the received one.p  pBut I did not find a way to do this with SpriteKit. I dont want to manually develop whats SpriteKit physics automatically made for mebr Im just searching for a way to simulate a 50ms jump in the futurep  pAny ideap

Negative 87680 pIm trying to write Int64.MinValue 0x8000000000000000 as a negative hexadecimal, but Visual Studio 2010 doesnt allow me because it assumes that 0x8000000000000000 must be a ulong literal, and and unsigned number cannot be negative.

Negative 87680 pI have an Excel file created from a SQL Report with a massive amount of tables. Ive been given the task to either delete rows or add page breaks depending on a cells value.p  pHere is a Google Spreadsheet that shows a very basic version of my Excel. a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd1cvDuVpu3NQqMf7wkj8D3DB1y54TmczaSbTZbx26sd8edituspsharing relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd1cvDuVpu3NQqMf7wkj8D3DB1y54TmczaSbTZbx26sd8edituspsharingap  pIf a sets Total is not 0, a page break is added. If a sets Total is 0, delete the set. The total is known by if its cell has a left border. The problem with my code is if a delete of a set occurs, and the next set has a lower row count than the deleted set, the code misses that set and starts affecting the following set excuse my poor explanation. p  pIn the example supplied, the FIRST set total lt 0 and SECOND set lt 0 each get page breaks. The THIRD set  0 is deleted. Since the FOURTH set is smaller in row count than the THIRD, the code appears in the FIFTH set, which is deleted  0 and deletes the FOURTH set with it. Had the FIFTH set not  0, itd leave the FOURTH set untouched and add the page break to the FIFTH set.p  pHeres the VBA for Excel code Im usingp  precodeSub Hello     For Each myWorksheet In Worksheets         myWorksheet.Activate         With myWorksheet             Dim Lastrow As Integer             Lastrow  myWorksheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count             Dim intLastStartRow As Integer             intLastStartRow  12             For Each myCell In RangeB12B amp Lastrow.Cells                 Dim lastRange As Range                 If myCell.BordersxlEdgeLeft.LineStyle ltgt xlNone Then                     Dim borderRange As Range                     Set borderRange  myWorksheet.RangeB amp myCell.Row                     If borderRange.Value ltgt 0 Then                         myWorksheet.RowsmyCell.Row  1.PageBreak  xlPageBreakManual                         intLastStartRow  myCell.Row  1                     Else                         myWorksheet.RowsintLastStartRow amp  amp myCell.Row.Delete                     End If                 End If             Next         End With     Next End Sub codepre

Negative 87680 pGood morning guys. I have a batch file that searches network PC user folders for XML files, then copies those files to a network location.  However, it copies folders for all users, regardless of whether they have the files in question.  What I would like to do is only make a folder for that user if the directory in which those files are contained exists.  p  pHere is what the code looks likep  precodefor d g in computer.domaincusers do  xcopy d q c i y gAppDataRoamingProgramFolder.xml server.domainsharedfolderg  codepre  pIt works perfectly but for creating a user folder for every user.  What I would like to do is only create a folder for users where AppdataRoamingProgramFolder contains XML files in the first place.  I cant figure out how to get an if exists statement to work within that for statement though. Also, this creates a directory structure like computer.domaincusersuser.  If there is a way to strip out the cusers so its computer.domainuserfile.xml, that would be even more amazing.  p  pThanks in advance p  pUpdate  Here is the full code the batch is using.  It repeats for each computerp  precodenet use k computer.domaincusers for d g in k do  forfiles P gAppDataRoamingProgramFolder m .xml D 7 C cmd C del path  net use k delete for d g in computer.domaincusers do if exist gAppdataRoamingProgramFolder.xml  xcopy d q c y gAppDataRoamingProgramFolder.xml server.domainsharedfoldernxg  forfiles P S MMAS500endiciapostbackarchive m .xml D 60 C cmd C del path codepre  pThe entire functionality is to delete XML files a week or older, then copy the remaining files, then delete files from the server that are two months or older.  That line is only at the end, but the other lines are repeated for each computer.br Perhaps there is a better way to go about it  When I run it this way, it seems like I dont get a folder for all users that meet the criteria.

It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used top      ul   lipavoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the abstract factory pattern does.pli   lipstrongavoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way e.g., using the new keywordstrong when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.pli   ul blockquote  pAnd from this QA a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq16738411065197Examples of GoF Design Patternsa, BalusC explains that prototype pattern in Java is implemented by a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangObject.htmlclonecodeObjectclonecodea only if the class implements a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangCloneable.htmlcodeCloneablecodea interface marker interface similar to codeSerializablecode to serializedeserialize objects.

Probably this also happens when unmarshalling JSON content as well.p  hr  pPeople would advise using object constructor, and I would mind that option when working with simple objects. This question is more oriented to deep copying complex objects, where I may have 5 levels of objects to clone. For examplep  precodefields is an abbreviation for primitive type and String type fields that can vary between 1 and 20 or more declared fields in the class and all of them will be filled during application execution class CustomerType      fields...   class Customer      CustomerType customerType     fields   class Product      fields   class Order      ListltProductgt productList     Customer customer     fields   class InvoiceStatus      fields   class Invoice      ListltOrdergt orderList     InvoiceStatus invoiceStatus     fields   class to communicate invoice data for external systems class InvoiceOutboundMessage      ListltInvoicegt invoice     fields  codepre  pLets say, I wantneed to copy a instance of codeInvoiceOutboundMessagecode.

The problem Im seeing is that, ultimately, the extractor just boils down to the 1st codecasecode statement, and the rest is just boilerplate. Instead, I think the following would be much more desirable for defining simple possibly oneoff or twiceoff extractorsp  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecodedef EmployedAtx Person Company     case Person, , SomePosition, Somecompany gt company  codepre  p...which is 2 full lines instead of 4.p  p how would I go about DRYing up the boilerplate to come to something as concise as the abovep

Negative 87680 pHow can I go about hiding an opponents score from a user in a TurnBasedMatchp  pTo elaborate a little further, I have created a UI that displays all the players in the match. It displays their pictures, their names, and their scores. For every player that is not you I would like to set their scores as hidden. So for example, user A, who is signed into the Google Game Services, will see user Bs score as hidden but will be able to see herhis own score. Likewise, user B, who is also signed into the Google Game services on a separate device, will see user As score as hidden but will be able to see hisher own score. Once the match is over all scores will become visible to all players involved.p  pAny suggestions on ways to implement this Is it possible to get an ID of the current user logged in and compare it to all the participant IDs of the match thus marking every nonequal ID as hiddenp  pThanks.p  pNote emThe scores are saved as part of the data of the match and are accessed via TurnBasedMatch.getDataemp

Negative 87680 pI am clock gating some stronglatchstrong and logic in my design. I dont have much experience in synthesis and place amp route.

Negative 87680 pIm coding a website similar to a forum. There are Posts that any user can make, only the poster can edit their post, but moderators can edit emanyem post, and admins can alter users privileges to promote them to ModAdmin, as well as alter board settings, etc.p  pSo here weve set the stage for as far as I understand it ACL where the posts can be altered by their owner strongandstrong RBAC where users can have roles to give them access to resources regardless of their individual requirements.p  pIm wondering about how to lay this out in my SQL tables. p  pI would have thought to do it like sop  pTables p  ul liUsers  ID  Name  etc   li liUsersGroups  UserID  GroupID   li liGroups  ID  Name  IsAdmin  CanEditOtherPosts  CanDoOtherStuff  Etc   li liPost  ID  Content  Owner  etc..li ul  pAnd so upon editing a post I would check if the user is the posts owner, or if has the CanEditOtherPosts option set true. p  pI know this implementation would work just fine, I decided to check phpBBs and Wordpresss MySQL structure before actually doing this. I have now become a little concerned.p  pIve noticed that in phpBB  Wordpress rather than naming their permissions in the Column name they have the followingp  ul liUsers  ID  Name  etcli liUsersGroups  UserID  GroupIDli liGroups  ID  Nameli liPermissions  ID  Nameli liGroupsPermissions  ID  GroupID  PermissionID  Valueli ul  pThis seems a lot more robust than my original solution. Making it so if I need to add a different permission later I dont have to add a column to the table. which isnt strongtoostrong hard Though is there any other reason why I should use this method over mine Would this method have any performance gainshits probably negligiblep  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated. My motto when creating this website is Do it right, the first time Rewriting something that already works for a performance gain or to get over a limitation is something that I want to avoid.

Negative 87680 pThis programs purpose is to translate Morse code into English. Ive divided the programs execution logic into three cases the translation of one Morse code character, two characters and three characters. This program tries to translate characters that fall under case three. If you can help, and decide to test the program, please input at least four morse code characters between a and d Otherwise, expect some outofbounds exceptionsp  hr  pWhats wrong with the switch I used Ive read that, up until a few years ago, Java did not support switch statements that used Strings. Java now supports String switch statements and, if Im not mistaken, my syntax agrees with the notverycomplex conventions of these statements. To determine whether the compiler first recognizes the switchs subject i.e. codeswitch aReferenceThatPointsToaStringcode, I printed the reference in the line preceding the switch. No problem there. I also looked at whether cases could be executed if the switchs subject were explicitly stated. Instead of saying codeswitch array3[i]code, I wrote in codeswitch .code This test did result in a working switch, leaving me with the impression that codeswitcharray3[i]code isnt quite the same as codeswitchaStringexpressioncodep  precodeimport java.util.Scanner  public class MorseToEnglish1   public static void main String[]args     System.out.printlnenter morse here     Scanner input  new Scanner System.in     String container  input.nextLine      char [] array  container.toCharArray     int count  0     for int i  0 i lt array.length i      if array[i]            count             count counts the number of times a space appears      System.out.printlncount     int [] array2  new int [count]     int counter  0     for int i  0 i lt array.length i          if array[i]                array2[counter]  i             counter                       array2 assigns the indexes of spaces to its members      System.out.printlncounter      String [] array3  new String [array2.length  1]     for int i  0 i lt array3.length  i          array3[i]  container.substringarray2[i], array2[i1]          array3 creates substrings based on these spaces     System.out.print array3[1]     System.out.printarray3[0]       tests above      for int i  0 i lt array3.length i          switch array3[i]         case .

GUIPanels child is GUIWindow.p  pGUIEngine stores pointers to GUIElements and loads various PNG files to be used by all the GUIElements. These PNG files are stored in a SpritePool, a simple double vector that stores both SDLTextures as well as stdstrings. The strings are the PNG file names.p  pI currently have two PNG files that are not rendering properly with the following code from the strongvoid GUIWindowrenderstrong function, windowtop and windowbottom.

Negative 87680 pI apologize if this is an ignorant question. It seems it should be trivial, yet I cant find a solution that works.p  pI have a Chart control in a Visual C 2010 form. Im reading a bunch of data out of a form, doing some computation, then plotting the results. Im using AddXY to add the data, and it works fine.p  pHowever, every time I call AddXY, it refreshes the chart. With a large data set, Id prefer that it suspend redraws until all the data is added, then resume redraws. I dont need to watch the line crawl across the screen, and it slows the load down substantially. I would think this would be simple.p  pUsing SuspendLayout on the control or the form didnt seem to affect it. The Chart class does not have a BeginUpdate and EndUpdate like some other controls do. This discussion talks about a workaround for flickerfree use, but that is more than I need.p  pAm I missing something stupid herep  pThanks.p

However, only rows which are visible are filtered.  When I scroll to the bottom of the table and apply the filter, the entire table is filtered as desired.brbr I also noticed, that when i move the horizontal divider, the divider doesnt repaint itself when it moves over the altered cells.

Negative 87680 pIn order for a class to be attached to a codeGameObjectcode it needs to inherit from codeMonoBehaviourcode. If I create a base character class that contains all the attributes shared by both NPCs and PCs, how do I create instances of that class and attach it to game objects To give a concrete example of the problem, if the base character class has variables like health, stamina, strength etc, and I want a particular game object to have a particular set of those attributes, how do I attach that to a game object as it cannot inherit the base character classp  pI suspect the mistake Im making is to think that these instances need to even be attached to the objects that I want them to be associated with, but some clear guidance here would be most appreciated. p

Negative 87680 pI have two input amount fields and a Submit button on a form in an ASP.NET MVC4 application.  If both amounts are left blank before clicking submit, serverside validation creates two error messages saying one or the other needs to be filled.  Everything works fine until then.p  pAfter this though, if I enter in one amount and click Submit, the form is not submitted, instead the error on the box that has the amount disappears.  I have to click Submit a second time in order to actually submit the form correctly.p  pI assume the error disappears because of jquery eager validation after initial error when the box loses focus, as I click Submit.

Negative 87680 pI need to search two sources in Liferay one a Liferay site, one a nonLiferay site. Thankfully, both have Lucene indexes. How can I read from both of them in my Liferay search I know how to use the Multireader in Lucene to use multiple indexes like a single index, but I cant find where to implement that in Liferay. p  pId prefer to just use Liferays built in stuff not Solr if I can help it. Is this the right solution If so, how can I implement it, if not, what should I do insteadp  pEDIT Both sites will still be uploading new content for awhile. However, if a merge moving Liferays stuff over and changing where Liferays lucene directory points would still allow both the be read write, that could work too.p

Negative 87680 pI am running RStudio Server version 0.98.978 with R 3.0.2. on an Ubuntu 14 server. Yesterday I executed a command that caused the session to freeze. Since then, every time I try to load that user profile and that user profile only, the browser hangs. I generally get an error message saying the browser has become unresponsive regardless of whether I use Chrome or IE .p  pSimple commands like R.Version take several minutes to complete.

Negative 87680 pI have a horizontal ScrollViewer that contains a single StackPanel, which is initially empty. UserControls are created on buttonclick, and added to the StackPanel. The code looks something like thisp  precodeltScrollViewer Grid.Column1 Grid.Row0 RequestedThemeDark ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollModeAuto ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAuto ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollModeDisabled ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityHiddengt     ltStackPanel xNameContainer HorizontalAlignmentLeft VerticalAlignmentTop WidthAutogt         ltUser controls added here dynamicallygt     ltStackPanelgt ltScrollViewergt codepre  pAs you can see the ScrollViewer is itself in a larger Grid. Now I would like a Polygon to be added to this ScrollViewer, but I cannot add it as a child directly, since Content can only be set once.

Negative 87680 pWhen using auto layout, I am confused on how to set the size of both my view and, more importantly, my labelsbuttonsimages.p  pI have read dozens of webpages perspectives. Many say that if I am using auto layout correctly, I should not need to explicitly state the size of my view objects. Yet, auto layout seems to almost demand exactly that, explicit size constraints If I do not give them, auto layout says my image and view sizes are ambiguous.p  pI would also like to know what auto layout will do when my conatraints are loaded on a retina display. Will my 300x90 image suddenly be half the size Will a view I pin 70 from the top now be covered by a navigation bar Most auto layout tutorials focus on how to use constraints, not how my 300x90 image will be manipulated by the iOS on different devices.p  pIt seems like, if they wanted the view to be fluid then I should be specifying percents, not specific pixel measurementsp  pCan anyone help me better understand how my views will scale up and downp

Negative 87680 pI am trying to add thread safety to a lazy init NSPersistantStoreCoordinator. I heard of the synchronized method in objectivec which doesnt exist in Swift.

I tried to put objcsyncexitself after and before the return with no luck. Is there some kind of best practice for this situation My real problem is that in my app, the persistentStoreCoordinator is being accessed by a thread while its being created by another, which makes the app crash. Thats why I want to use the synchronizedself.p

Negative 87680 pI have a list of integers and I am trying to achieve Olog n by using a recursive algorithm to identify a dip in a list of integers.

First and last elements can be considered dips as long as the number next to them is greater than or equal to these elements.p  pI have been able to achieve On by simply iterating through the list, however Im trying to use an approach similar to the binary search algorithm to achieve a faster result. I only need to find a single dip in the list.p  pMy problem is when I separate the list into left and right of the midpoint I eventually reach smaller lists with onetwo elements but they are not necessarily pits as they do not take into consideration the numbers just outside of their slices.p  pCan anyone help me p  precodedef finddiplst      if lenlst  1           return 0      elif lenlst  2           if lst[0] lt lst[1]                return 0           else                return 1      else           ans  False           mid  lenlst  2           printtest           if lst[mid1] gt lst[mid] lt lst[mid1]                ans  mid           elif ans  False and lenlst[mid] gt 2                if lst[mid] gt lst[mid1] lt lst[mid2]                     ans  mid1           elif ans  False and lenlst[mid] gt 2                if lst[mid2] gt lst[mid1] lt lst[mid]                     ans  mid1                 elif ans  False                ans  finddiplst[mid]           else                ans  finddiplst[mid1]           return ans codepre

Negative 87680 pIve made a class revolved around implementing queues using a linked list. My implementation works fine. However, I have to write a constructor which is passed a queue, and it has to make a duplicate of the original queue. By duplicate, I mean that all the elements in each queue are the same, but the actual nodes are not. How would I go about doing thisp  pP.S.

Negative 87680 pIm seeing a weird linking issue on Linux with a crossplatform library project that uses CMake to create both an OS X Framework and a Linux shared library from the same source tree. The crossplatform aspect of that project has worked well in the past up to about two years ago, but since then, we have exclusively done development work on OS X. The reason for the temporary Linux abandonment was a developer shortage all those who remained used OS X  there was no technical reason for not building the source on Linux for some years. p  pAnd with one potentially relevant exception more on this later, there have been no fundamental changes to our source in the meantime. But of course Linux has advanced so of course there were some minor snags at first when we went back there. Things like the new version of the compiler complaining about things they had not complained about in the past questionable casts, void pointer voodoo, and such. These issues were resolved in short order.p  pThe entire source tree now compiles again on Mint 17.1 with some definitely harmless remaining warnings. But linking fails with a rather bizarre messagep  precodeLinking CXX shared library libltourLibNamegt.so CMakeFilesltfile1gt.c.o11 error stray 177 in program CMakeFilesltfile1gt.c.o11 error stray 2 in program CMakeFilesltfile2gt.c.o11 error stray 213 in program and so on, thousands of times, with seemingly random values in the quotes for all the object files in the library codepre  pTo me, this looks like the linker is accidentally trying to emcompileem the object files one more time, instead of linking them. Switching between gcc and clang made no difference.p  pAs I already said, there was one potentially relevant structural change to the project since it last compiled under Linux it used to be a combination of only C and ObjectiveC sources. It now contains C, ObjectiveC strongemas well as ObjectiveCemstrong source. On OS X, this change has not caused any issues whatsoever, and it is very hard for me to imagine that this addition of some .mm files is causing what we are seeing here. But still  weirder things have happened.p  pAlso, there is a popular issue with several articles on stackoverflow about erroneously including unicode characters in CC programs. This is not the problem here  no such messages appear during the actual compilation. The circus only starts once linking should happen.p  pThe source tree is far too large to post, and the CMake files are also fairly involved, nested, and large i.e. impossible to include here. To add insult to injury, they have worked fine in the past, on Ubuntu 10.10. Which I dont have around anymore, to test if the current tree still works there that would have been far too easy, I guess. The relevant commands in the CMakeList that generate the library under Linux arep  precodesettargetproperties     ltourLibNamegt      PROPERTIES         VERSION    2.0         SOVERSION  2       targetlinklibraries     ltourLibNamegt     ourotherlinklibraries       install      TARGETS         ltourLibNamegt     DESTINATION         lib      codepre  pwhich still looks o.k. to me at first glance.

This I am not talking from what gets passed to make install, using the setup from python.orgp  pSo I want to know in which case the python gets installed here codeLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersionscodep  pand in which case its gets installed here codeusrlocallibcodep  pare there default behaviours of pip, brew, easyinstall of where to install python p  pnow when I installed python3.5 rc version using alt install it got itself to codeusrlocallibcode I supposed this happened because I did not want to ruin my existing python 2.7 installation, but then why cant or why is it chosen to instal to user level rather than in codeLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersionscode where Current symlink can point to different version.p  pIs there better strategy to install python from source that it gets installed one place without having to change the codeCurrentcode symlink to code2.7code p  pAttempting to install python 3.3 from python branch 3.3 I am really stuck at this make error when i try to do install or test saying p  precodegcc c Wnounusedresult fnocommon dynamic DNDEBUG g fwrapv O3 Wall Wstrictprototypes     I.

Negative 87680 pLets say I want to model an issue tracker, and my model, consists of two entities Repository and Issue. A repository may contain several issues.

I see various options, but Im not sure whats best.p  h1Calculate Id manually when instantiating the issueh1  pNot using any automatic generation, just setting the value before persisting. So query the issues for the repository, calculate the maximum issue number if any, increment, set and persist. This feels a bit error prone, because if you will instantiate issues from other segments of the code, you will need to keep this in mind.p  precodeIssue issue  new Issue issue.setRepositoryrepository  For example, assuming this is right for the context now issue.setIssueNumberrepository.getIssues.size  1 codepre  pObviously this one can being refactored to deduplicate this issue number generation but that does not prevent Issues with a codenullcode issueNumber being codepersistedcode on an codeEntityMangercodep  h1JPA Lifecycle Eventsh1  pUsing JPA Lifecycle Events, hooking on the codePrePersistcode and doing the same there.

Negative 87680 pIve got a basic web2py app running, as Im making a simple website for my organization.  Its going to be extremely simple  there will be no user logins, no information, no databases, nothing  its really going to be mostly static.  The only dynamic content will be a couple of scrapers showing what our group has been up to recently.  However, my web2py app seems to force every single connection to go over HTTPS.  I dont want this, because since I selfsigned the SSL certificate for admin login purposes, every browser acts like my website is some malicious attack website because the SSL certificate isnt verified.  I want to allow normal connections to the nonadmin, frontfacing part of my site to use HTTP, but they always, no matter what browser I use or if cookieshistory are cleared etc, redirect to HTTPS and trigger that malicious website warning all browsers seem to have.  I just want the site to allow normal HTTP.  Anyone know what I can dop

Negative 87680 pIm trying to develop a RESTful api using the hypertext as an engine of application state principals.p  pIve settled on using the Link header RFC5988 for all state transitions, it seems natural to place links there, and doesnt make my response types specific on an implementation eg XMLjsonetc all just work.p  pWhat Im struggling with at the moment is the pagination of a collection of resources. In the past Ive used the Range header to control this, so the client can send Range MyObjects020 and get the first 20 back. It seems natural to want to include a next relation to indicate the next 20 items but maybe it isnt, but Im unsure how to do it.p  pMany examples include the range information as part of the URI. eg it would bep  pcodeLink lthttptest.commyitemsstart20ampend40gtrelnextcodep  pUsing the range header would I do something like the followingp  pcodeLink lthttptest.commyitemsrelnextrangemyitems2040codep  pThe concern here is that the link feels nonstandard. A client would have to be checking the range header to get the next items.  p  pThe other thing is, would I just leave this all as somewhat outofband information. Never showing nextprevious ranges as that sort of depends on what the client is doing, and expect the client to just serialize down what it needs when it needs it. I can use the acceptsranges link hints in the initial link to the collection to let the client know its pageablep  peg something likep  precodeOPTIONS httptest.com gt Linklthttptest.commyitemsrelhttptest.comrelsbusinessconceptacceptsrangesmyitem codepre  pThen the client would go, oh it accepts ranges, I will only pull down the first X, and then go for the next range as necessary this sort of feels like implicit states though.p  pI can seem to figure out what is really in the best spirit of HATEOAS here.p

Also, Id like the timing to be unaffected by the amount of processing taking place in between calls, which I guess will depend on how much musical activity is occurring at any given moment. But this is just timecode, no notes, and even so the timing is not accurate enough. Im using Python 2.7 on Windows 7 later on OSX 10.9 and Linux. Everywhere I look, I find results for benchmarking code or functions, but what I want is to execute some code 100 times per second without drift. Any ideas My codep  precodeimport time import threading as th  ind  0  class MyThreadth.Thread     def initself, event         th.Thread.initself         self.stopped  event         self.ind  0      def runself         while not self.stopped.wait0.01             self.ind  1             if self.ind  100  0                 print time.clock             if self.ind  1000                 self.stopped.set  stopFlag  th.Event thread  MyThreadstopFlag thread.start codepre  pThanks a million Chuckkp

Negative 87680 pIm plotting yield for products. I have two ways of classifying products, lets say these two ways are first as numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ect, and then as letters, a, b, c, d, e, ect. The letters are a subcategory of the numbers. So within products, I have many different letters within individual number groupsp  p1 a, b, c, ep  p2 c, dp  p3 ap  pFor each product, Ive calculated yield and plotted it in a pivot table. Ive plotted the pivot table so that the letters are a subcategory of the numbers within the column labels, please see picture below please note that in the picture the subcategory is labelled using numbers as well, the letters subcategory is just to try to explain with more contrast in this questionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPLNqT.png altAn example of this can be seen herep  pThis is all well and good, but Id like to find an average of everything within the numbers umbrella category. However, theres one final problem to consider with the task the amount of products that contribute to a yield average may be different per letter subcategory. I.ep  p1  a 2 out of 2 products yielded  1 fractional yieldp  p1  b 2 out of 22 products yielded  0.09 fractional yield p  pThis leads to a problem while using pivot tables. Using the above yield fractions, if I was using the pivot tabless average of yield to work out the total yield for all the 1 group, it would calculatep  p1  0.09  2 ....  0.54 fractional yieldp  pBut we can see that this isnt a true representation of yield, as it should bep  p2  2  2  22  p  p4  24  p  p0.17 fractional yieldp  pCan anyone work out a way of calculating true yield with pivot tables rather than the average of an averagep

We are using AFNetworking 2, up to date to the latest version.p  pI read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23173839afnetworking20andusecacheonlywhenofflinethis answera, and the a hrefhttpwww.hpique.com201403howtocacheserverresponsesiniosapps relnofollowpost linked to ita, but unfortunately the method used by codeAFHTTPSessionManagercode to perform a multipart POST, codePOSTparametersconstructingBodyWithBlocksuccessfailurecode does not call the ones that the guide suggests to override.p  pThe guide suggests to emenable offline modeem by changing the codecachePolicycode of the request sent used to create the codeNSURLSessionDataTaskcode, and to force caching by modifying the headers of the response. The first is done by overriding the method codeAFHTTPSessionManagercode calls to create the task, the second by overriding the codeNSURLSessionDataDelegatecode delegate implementation related with caching.p  pAs said above, neither of those is called. In particular, the method called to get a data task instance is codeuploadTaskWithStreamedRequestprogresscompletionHandlercode which returns a codeNSURLSessionUploadTaskcode. That I can successfully override and performing the same trick on the codecachePolicycode value.p  pWhen it comes to the delegate though, as far as I understand, the library sets a new delegate rather than codeselfcode, codeAFURLSessionManagerTaskDelegatecode. This object, despite conforming to codeNSURLSessionDataDelegatecode does not implement the caching method, and I cant find any way to set a caching callback on it.p  pAny idea on how to proceed Any blogpost to point top  pIm considering overriding the method setting that codeAFURLSessionManagerTaskDelegatecode, to provide my own emdecoratedem subclass, that implements the caching delegate method.

Negative 87680 pI am designing a mobile app for task management todo list plus lots of extra goodies that can be used offline and sync up when reconnected. I have been impressed with Couch and Pouch DB but am still not sure on the best structure of databases and roles. My situation is that a user can have many tasks and tasks can be shared to many other users read only either directly or via assigning a task to a group and then sharing that group with specific users.p  pAfter reading through the following question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28874087couchdbreplicationstrategywithdynamicgroupsofusersCouchDB replication strategy with dynamic groups of usersa I think I may not allow direct sharing of a task and and only allow sharing through Groups. Then each group is effectively a role in Couch which I can then manage authorization to. I can write an API from my webapp so that a mobile user can get a list of groups that are shared to them and then set up a oneway replication from each DB based group to their local Pouch DB. Each user would also have a read and write access to a DB of their own tasks with two way sync from Pouch to Couch. There would be a filtered replication from their own Couch DB to each Role based DB that the task belongs to.p  pMy main questions arep  ol liIs this a valid structure or are there flaws in my logic that would make this difficultli liWhat would be the best way to handle when a user was removed from a grouprole and how to delete any previously replicated tasks on their local Pouch DB now that the Group is no longer shared to them they no longer have that roleli liA user may delete a group which will mean the entire role based DB will need to be deleted  are the any implications of thisli ol

Negative 87680 pWe have a hybrid app with phonegapcordova which supports multiple users.  The app does a logon through a jquery ajax call against a backend system and receives a session cookie. p  pI was surprised to see that if the app is closed force close on Android or swipe to close in iOS and it is restarted, the session cookie is persisted. Its therefore included in the next logon request. Since the user has done no concrete log out action, they are still logged in if the session has not timed out. Since there is multiple users in the app, they may now be logged in as different user than they think.p  pIn order to support multiple users, we need to reset the cookie state before triggering the next login state. p  pI do not want to waste a separate HTTP request which explicitly logs the user out before attempting log out. p  pIs it possible to send an asynchronous ajax request on the onStop handler of phonegap Any other optionsp
Negative 87680 pI am trying to add functionality to a print preview window i have. I know that CKEditor is not intended for document creation but it has handled it very well so far.

However the problem is that my method for getting the cursor does not account for Page breaks, which would cause this method to be inaccurate. p  pMy question is, what is the best way account for this so that the pdf opens almost exactly where the cursor was. p

Negative 87680 pIn order to to get Polymers databinding without creating a custom element, I am using the dombind template helper.

The issue I am running into is that both codedombindcode and codedomrepeatcode seem to create local dom and put the result inside of it. p  pTo create my grid, I need to access both the container for the grid, which will be the codesectioncontentcode element and the grid items, which are the codeskillcategorycode elements inside the codedomrepeatcode template. p  pIf they all resided in the same document, I think could do I am new to masonry, so this might not actually work p  precodedocument.addEventListenerWebComponentsReady, function       resume sectioncontent.masonry         columnWidth resume skillcategory[0],         itemSelector skillcategory,         isFitWidth true       codepre  pBut the queries dont seem to work because presumably the elements I need are hidden away from the main document in the shadow dom. p  pI was able to get access to the content inside coderesumecontainercode viap  precodePolymer.domdocument.querySelectorresumecontainer.node.content codepre  pHowever, I still cant get to the codeskillcategorycode elements in the codedomrepeatcode.

Negative 87680 pI have a GPUImageView that works great for my purposes except Id like to do custom drawing on top of it and have been so far unsuccessful. I havent found much online to help so if anyone has experience in this area, some advice would be deeply appreciated.p  pThings Ive triedp  pA Containing my GPUImageView as a subview inside an NSView to which I can draw. Two things that prevented me from making progress with this was 1 keeping the GPUImageView the same size as the containing NSView and 2 the custom drawing implemented inside the containers drawRect method stays behind the GPUImageView, rather than on top of it. I could possibly deal with that by having a second subview on top of the GPUImageView that actually handles the drawing, but the resizing problem would be even more difficult in that case.p  pB Ive tried subclassing GPUImageView and overriding drawRect directly to issue CoreGraphics drawing commands but I havent been able to obtain a valid CGContext to draw to.p  pC Ive tried issuing OpenGL drawing commands inside the drawRect override, but these conflict with the GPUImage drawing commands even when issuing them as synchronous calls on the GPUImageViews video processing queue.p  pIve been struggling with this for a few days, so if anyone has any experience or ideas as to how I could draw custom elements think basic CGFillRect type of stuff on top of a GPUImageView please let me know.p
