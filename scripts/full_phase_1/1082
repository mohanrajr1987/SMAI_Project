Positive 1082 pI am making a little program where some balls are bouncing inside a box. The logic for that has already been done in a class called Ball.java and balls are bouncing and moving normally. p  pI want to take it a step further and to draw a rectangle inside of the Jframe and have the ball behave a specific way when theres two inside. There should only be 2 balls moving inside the boundaries of the rectangle. Other balls going in the rectangle should freeze until one of the 2 currently moving balls leaves it. A moving ball exiting the rectangle should freeze unless there is another ball in the box meaning the rectangle should never be empty.p  pBelow is my logic where this should be implemented, I drew the rectangle with codeg.drawRect75, 75, 200, 200code in the paincomponents method, I have trouble making the balls know theyre inside that rectangle.p  precodepackage bouncingball  import bouncingball.Ball import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter import java.awt.event.MouseEvent import java.util.ArrayList import javax.swing.JPanel  public class BallPanel extends JPanel   private Ball ball private ArrayListltBallgt balls  new ArrayList private int ballsInside  0  public BallPanel      addMouseListenernew Mouse   method for creating a new ball private void newBallMouseEvent click      ball  new Ballthis     balls.addball     Thread t  new Threadball     t.setPriorityThread.NORMPRIORITY     t.start     System.out.printlnNew ball created   public void animate      while true          repaint    public synchronized void countIn throws InterruptedException   while ballsInside lt 2  wait    ballsInside  notifyAll      public synchronized void countMaxIn throws InterruptedException   while ballsInside  2  wait    ballsInside  notifyAll    private class Mouse extends MouseAdapter       Override     public void mousePressedfinal MouseEvent event          newBallevent        Override public void paintComponentGraphics g      super.paintComponentg     g.drawRect75, 75, 200, 200     for Ball ball  balls          if ball  null              ball.drawg                 codepre  pand my ball classp  precodepackage bouncingball  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.event.MouseEvent import java.util.Random  import java.lang.Runnable import javax.swing.JPanel import java.util.ArrayList  public class Ball implements Runnable   public final static Random random  new Random  final static int SIZE  30 final static int MAXSPEED  5  BallPanel panel  new BallPanel  private int x private int y  private int dx private int dy  private Color color  Color.BLUE private ArrayListltBallgt balls    Override    public void run      while true          move         try              Thread.sleep40   wake up roughly 25 frames per second          catch InterruptedException exception              exception.printStackTrace                 public BallBallPanel panel      this.panel  panel     x  random.nextIntpanel.getWidth     y  random.nextIntpanel.getHeight     dx  random.nextInt2  MAXSPEED  MAXSPEED     dy  random.nextInt2  MAXSPEED  MAXSPEED   public void drawGraphics g      g.setColorcolor     g.fillOvalx, y, SIZE, SIZE   public void move        check for bounce and make the ball bounce if necessary          if x lt 0 ampamp dx lt 0          bounce off the left wall          x  0         dx  dx          if y lt 0 ampamp dy lt 0          bounce off the top wall         y  0         dy  dy          if x gt panel.getWidth  SIZE ampamp dx gt 0          bounce off the right wall         x  panel.getWidth  SIZE         dx  dx          if y gt panel.getHeight  SIZE ampamp dy gt 0          bounce off the bottom wall         y  panel.getHeight  SIZE         dy  dy           make the ball move     x  dx     y  dy   codepre

Positive 1082 pIm having problems with a packaged program I built using the NetBeans IDE and Java Swing. When the project is built from netbeans, it copies all the libraries the program is dependent on, including the sqlite4java API that I use into a folder called lib within the folder dist. Dist also holds the executable .jar file. When the file is opened, the normal jFrame opens and the program runs fine until a SQLiteConnection is called. No errors are returned, but the program always fails to go past that point in the executable .jar file.

Positive 1082 pI have a work assignment which isp  pCreate a subclass of JPanel, named RegularPolygonPanel, to paint an nsided regular polygon. The class contains a property named numberOfSides, which specifies the number of sides in the polygon. The polygon is centered at the center of the panel. The size of the polygon is proportional to the size of the panel. Create a pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, and octagon, nonagon, and decagon from RegularPolygonPanel and display them in a frame.p  pYour Task 1. Create a class named RegularPolygonPanel to paint an nsided regular polygon. So, if n is 3, it paints a triangle, if n is 4, it paints a square, etc. 2. Create a frame classes that contains pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, and octagon, nonagon, and decagon. These objects are created from RegularPolygonPanel. 3. Draw a UML diagram for RegularPolygonPanel class and the frame class.p  pNow so far I have been able to make the gui and display a hexagon, I assumethe shape has 6 sides a hrefhttpimgur.comqOk4OPI relnofollowhttpimgur.comqOk4OPIap  pIn all honestly this is more if a request for guidance than a specific question.

Positive 1082 phello guys i just want to ask a question again, so im trying to make a POS system right now my problem is that, I want to make my jtable add the same items in a single row and add their quantity and adjust its price, for ex. product 1 already existed in the table and i want to add the same product 1 but with different quantity, and that additional product 1 will add its quantity to the previous product 1 that is already in the table and then adjust the price of the product 1.p  phope i got myself clear, sorry for my bad englishp
Positive 1082 pIm using graphics to recreate a state machine like Im showing a hrefhttpi809.photobucket.comalbumszz12laurabruges1ejzpsihdkfwiq.png relnofollowherea. What Im trying to do is that if the user moves a state A and it overlaps another one B, then A might not change its position.p  pAt first I thought that I had to validate if the distance between the new location of A and the center of any other state doesnt exceed a certain value, then it could be moved. I use a HashMap to store the states and used Iterator to validate the position of each state. It worked, but the states started to move slower than before when I dragged the mouse.p  pDo you know any better way for doing that Thanks for your help  p

Positive 1082 pI am using Java and Eclipse to build a program that logs users in by checking usernames and passwords from a SQLite database. I am completely brand new to GUIs and it was pointed out to me in a previous post that my GUI and program logic is not very well structured. With that said, I have successfully logged four different users in and displayed their previously entered information on a form with textFields and comboBoxs. My Query on the SQL database is working great retrieving this information and I have been able to show the user that information in the correct fields. As you can see in my code below, I have a textField called strongUsernameCuststrong. This is where I want to pull my variable to select from in the WHERE clause of my query. The problem is that this textField is located in the Window.Java class and I am trying to use this variable in the CustomerInfo.Java class. I have done a ton of research on gettersetter methods and other ways to pass variables from class to class, but the sheer size and frankly bad logic of my program is making it nearly impossible. How can I pass this variable to the CustomerInfo.Java class Please feel free to correct my class logic as well. I have tried moving things around but lost functionality of the program, so I am trying to achieve this with the structure that I have.p  pHere is the Window.Java classp  precodeimport java.awt.EventQueue import java.awt.Font import java.sql. import javax.swing. import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.ActionEvent codepre  ppublic class Window p  precodeprivate JFrame frame public static JTextField textFieldUsernameCust     Launch the application.   public static void mainString[] args      EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable          public void run              try                  Window window  new Window                 window.frame.setVisibletrue              catch Exception e                  e.printStackTrace                              Connection connectionnull public JPasswordField passwordFieldCust public JTextField textFieldUsernameComp public JPasswordField passwordFieldComp     Create the application.   public Window      initialize     connectionsqliteConnection.dbConnector      Initialize the contents of the frame.   private void initialize      frame  new JFrame     frame.setResizablefalse     frame.setBounds100, 100, 623, 382     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     frame.getContentPane.setLayoutnull      JLabel lblUsername  new JLabelUsername     lblUsername.setFontnew FontTahoma, Font.PLAIN, 14     lblUsername.setBounds86, 166, 86, 14     frame.getContentPane.addlblUsername      JLabel lblPassword  new JLabelPassword     lblPassword.setFontnew FontTahoma, Font.PLAIN, 14     lblPassword.setBounds86, 202, 65, 14     frame.getContentPane.addlblPassword      textFieldUsernameCust  new JTextField     textFieldUsernameCust.setBounds182, 165, 97, 20     frame.getContentPane.addtextFieldUsernameCust     textFieldUsernameCust.setColumns10      JButton btnLoginCust  new JButtonLogin Customer     btnLoginCust.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent arg0              try                  String queryselect  from CustomerInfo where Username and Password                 PreparedStatement pstconnection.prepareStatementquery                 pst.setString1, textFieldUsernameCust.getText                  pst.setString2, passwordFieldCust.getText                   ResultSet rspst.executeQuery                 int count0                 whilers.next                     countcount1                                  if count1                                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Login Successful                     frame.dispose                     CustomerInfo custinfonew CustomerInfo                     custinfo.setVisibletrue                                  else ifcountgt1                                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Duplicate Username or Password                                  else                                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Username or Password is incorrect.

You can see above that I have been using strongString username  Customer3strong to test my query. This is where I need to pass the username variable from the first class so the WHERE clause is dynamic based on the username entered to login. Later, I will also need to pass all the variables I set after the Query into yet another class to compare with if statements, so I will need to yet again pass variables from class to class. If I am on the right track trying to use getters and setters, where in the above code would they be placed and how should I properly call them Thank youp

Positive 1082 pIm wondering whats the most efficient way of repainting in my case, and how to go about it.p  pIve got a codeJFramecode, containing a codeJPanelcode. This codeJPanelcode contains a some AWT graphics. Some of these graphics are fixed, they dont move. Some other graphics on top of the fixed graphics in this panel do move. The layout is updated every 3 seconds. The fixed graphics require quite a bit of math to draw, so I probably dont want to repaint all graphics, but only the moving ones. p  pThis is the possibilities I came up withp  ol liTo put the fixed graphics and the moving graphics in two separate panels and only repaint one panel, which are layed over each other.li liTo add two different codeGraphicscode objects to the panel one for fixed graphics and one for the moving and only repaint one graphics object. is this even possibleli liPerhaps some other way I dont knowli ol

Negative 1082 pI am currently working on a project where a programmer who fancied themselves a graphic designer attempted their hand at ASP.Net themes. The CSS is pretty bad, but that is another question altogether.p  pWhat I really need help with is the best way to organize ASP.Net Themes and the CSS that lies within them. Imagine that there is a directory structure that looks something like thisp  ul liThemes ul liTheme A ul liStyleA.cssli liemCommon.cssemli ulli liTheme B ul liStyleB.cssli liemCommon.cssemli ulli liTheme C ul liStyleC.cssli liemCommon.cssemli ulli ulli ul  pEach theme has a common stylesheet in it. Unfortunately the author of those style sheets managed to change only a few things here and there in each copy of emCommon.cssem. Eventually I will evaluate whether or not those changes are even necessary, but some major cleanup needs to happen first. For now just assume that the changes, ever so small, are necessary for things to look right with each theme.p  pI would like to know what the best practices are for using themes while also needing some common styles across your application. I want to minimize the number of AppTurns in the page load, but I really want to consolidate common styles into one place in a way that maintains the ease of themes.p

Negative 1082 pI want to write a service probably in c that monitors a database table.  When a record is inserted into the table I want the service to grab the newly inserted data, and perform some complex business logic with it too complex for TSQL.p  pOne option is to have the service periodically check the table to see if new records have been inserted.  The problem with doing it that way is that I want the service to know about the inserts as soon as they happen, and I dont want to kill the database performance.p  pDoing a little research, it seems like maybe writing a CLR trigger could do the job.  I could write trigger in c that fires when an insert occurs, and then send the newly inserted data to a Windows or WCF service.p  pWhat do you think, is that a good or even possible use of SQL CLR triggersp  pAny other ideas on how to accomplish thisp

Negative 1082 pIm trying to figure out the best way to save serialize and later open deserialize a tree structure. My structure is made up of various object types with different properties, but each inherits from a base abstract Node class.p  pEach node has unique ID GUID, and has an AddSuperNodeNode nd method that will set the parent of a node. This in turn calls other methods that allow the parent node to know what sub nodes it has. However, some nodes also utilize a strongAddAuxSuperNodestrong method that adds a secondary parent to the Node.p  pI was using binary serialization, but now I think I want to use something where I have a bit more control, and the serialized data is more accessible. I also want to retain Type information when I deserialize, and be able to serialize private values. So strongDataContractSerializerstrong seemed like the best way to go.p  pI cant just serialize the root strongNodestrong directly because of nodes having multiple parents. I do not want to create duplicate objects. So it would seem that I need to deconstruct the tree into a flat list, and then serialize that. Then after serializing that list reconstruct the tree. Does this sound rightp  pLike I said before each strongNodestrong has a unique GUID identifier, but right now Nodes reference their parentschildren directly and do not store their ids. I could update the strongAddSuperNodestrong and strongAddAuxSuperNodestrong methods to also update a list of parent ids to be serialized in addition to the direct references.

Negative 1082 blockquote   h3Duplicate a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20856howdoyourecommendimplementingtagsortaggingHow do you recommend implementing tags or taggingah3 blockquote  pWhats a efficient, fast and elegant architecture for a tagging system such as posts or photos.  For example, you have a site like StackOverflow and each item has a couple of tags. Whats the best way to keep track of these, and make them searchable. Scalability is important as well. p  phr p  pHave a tags column per each item. So in the database for that items row you have string with all the tags tag1 tag2 tag3 keyword anothertag etc. Then you can allow fulltext search index on that column. p  phr p  pHave a tags table. Where it maps tagitemid. This would make searching faster... you can search for the tagkeyowrd and get a list of all the itemids.p  phr p  pBoth of these seem like the obvious solutions, but for very very large data sets, seems like a pretty inefficient method. Any thoughts or other ways to implement a tagging system p

Negative 1082 pI have a button that when clicked opens a Popup. The Popup is a submenu containing more buttons. When one of the buttons on the submenu are clicked the Popup closes. I also want the Popup to close when the user clicks somewhere outside the Popup. Its also important to note that the majority of the screen is taken up by a WindowsFormsHost that displays an OpenGL Win Forms control.p  pClosing the Popup when a submenu button is clicked Ive been able to do. Within the click handler for those buttons I close the Popup. However, closing the Popup when clicking somewhere else is where Ive run into a problem.p  pThings Ive triedp  pSetting PopUp.StaysOpen to false. This works in that when clicking elsewhere on the screen, the Popup closes. However, on the Win Forms control it seems to require a click to close the Popup then a second click to perform what ever action. This is very undesirable. p  pIve tried handling the LostFocus event for the button that opens the Popup and setting StaysOpen to true. This works in that clicking off the Popup doesnt require the second click on the Win Forms control. The problem now is that the LostFocus event is handled and the Popup closed before it reads a click on any buttons on the Popup. This makes the submenu unusable.p

Is there any performance overhead caused by the usage of attributes Think for a class likep  precode    public class MyClass             int Count getset      codepre  pwhere it has 10 attibutes attributes being classes, where the attribute classes themselves are way larger than MyClass itself likep  precodepublic class FirstAttribute  Attribute     int A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J ... getset  codepre  p2.. Would 10 of these attributes be a memory overhead everytime codeMyClasscode is instantiated codeFirstAttributecode being 10 times the size of codeMyClasscode which will be decorated with 10 of these, so making the actual object itself so small compared to the total size of the attributes that are decorated on it. Is this a concernp  p3.. Would this scenario be any different for structs Structs being value types and attributes being reference typesp  p4.. Where are attibutes stored in memory in relation to the object that they are attached How are they hooked togetherp  p5.. Are attributes initialized as soon as codeMyClasscode is initialized or when you use reflection to retrieve themp

Suddenly a bunch of tests that excercise codeMyClasscode get the red x  for class not found  p  pIn codesrcmaintestcodep  precodecom.foo.DbUnitTest com.foo.mypackage.FooTest extends DbUnitTest codepre  pDbUnitTest gets a class not found.  I do a clean, and everything is fine.  I touch something, and it breaks again .  I dont really know where to begin on how to troubleshoot this.  p

Negative 1082 pI am using a lot of custom GWT events which 100s of objects need to register to receive. Is there anyway I could automatically register types of classes with each other. Or is there simply no way around it, the event handler manger needs the references to all the objects wanting to receive events. Would I be better off implementing my own type of event bus system Any ideas on the matter would be most helpful thanks.p  pEdit Examplep  pLets say I have over 1000 walls objects that make up a maze in which the walls can be moved around to find an exit and 200 NPC and 1 player Object inside the walled maze. Every time one of the playersNPCs hits the wall an onCollision the event is fired. So for all the wall objects to receive this event they most all register with the player and npcs. Seen as there are 1000 wall objects that quite a bit of registering. p  pSo what I am asking is, is there a way predefine that any object of type wall will receive event type onCollision form any object of type NPC or player. p
Negative 1082 pI have an opensource application on the Android market.  It seems to work fine for me with over 1,000 active installs, I have to presume that it works for most people.p  pI recently got a a hrefhttpcode.google.companddaavenissuesdetailid21 relnofollowbug reporta that indicated a problem for at least three users on Samsung phones Intercept and Captivate.  I have been unable to reproduce the problem on my ADP2 and on the emulator.p  pIn order to get enough data to diagnose the problem, I first tried to add logging and then I asked users to submit logs via a hrefhttpwww.appbrain.comappcom.xtralogic.android.logcollector relnofollowLog Collectora.  Each time a user tried to send the log there were four attempts, it was truncated and I did not get any useful data.p  pI then added a hrefhttpacra.googlecode.com relnofollowACRAa to the project in an attempt to get information, but I dont seem to be able to automatically detect the bug in order to send a report.p  pSince I dont have a Samsung phone and I cant reproduce it on anything where I could connect with the debugger, I am mostly out of ideas.  The only idea I have left is to add a button to the UI to generate a report.p  pAre there any other approaches to suggestp  pstrongUpdatestrong since people are asking for more specifics essentially, the app reads in text files from the assets and puts them with some preprocessing into a TextView in a ScrollView.  The data is prgressively added to a SpannableStringBuffer and then that is passed to TextViews setText function.  Depending on the options chosen, the text displayed is between 15k115k.  On phones with this issue, only part of the text is displayed.  The cutoff point depends on the options, but seems to be somewhere between 17k18k.p  pACRA sends a report for all uncaught exceptions and puts them into a Google FormSpreadsheet.  Ive gotten reports from my emulator and from my phone, so I know that end works.  Actually, Ive often found it faster to debug from the stack trace in that report than to attach the debugger to the process.p  pPhone specs I have exercised the app on emulators running 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, and 2.2.  My phone is ADP2 the developer version of the MyTouch, but Ive installed a a hrefhttpwww.cyanogenmod.com relnofollowthirdparty ROMa to jump up to Froyo 2.2.  I am unaware of an emulator specifically for the Samsung OS build, although that would be quite helpful here.p  pSince the expected text length is constant, I emshouldem be able to detect if it is read correctly or not.  I added checks at the end of my text processing, but those never triggered, indicating that the problem was not with reading the file.  I then tried adding checks to onPostCreate and onPostResume, but those did not fail either.  It seems that the UI thread had not yet actually run at that point, though.p  pIve now done 6 private APK versions attached to the bug in the bug tracker.  I frankly am surprised that any users are still trying them.  This latest version has a button to force a bug report  that will only be called after the UI thread has laid out the screen.  Hopefully that will give me enough variable information to point me in the right direction.p
Negative 1082 pI am using a Silverlight usercontrol in my ASP.NET web app. The user control has several autocomplete boxes and it seems that the enter key never fires the keydown event in any of them while it fires for other keys.p  pIm assuming that autocomplete boxes must handle the enter key in a different way, perhaps for chosing an item from the list.  Thus it works with simple text boxes.p  pI was thinking about overriding the eventhandler in a new deriving control...p  pHave you guys found a solution for thisp

Negative 1082 pI am looking for a testing framework that allows me to havep  ol listrongDifferent kindscategories of tests.strong I want to be able to just run all fast tests or all slow tests. I know MSTest allows you to create lists and run then run them, but I find it annoying and distracting. Id like to just tag the tests with attributes as I am developing them, and then just have something like a combobox that lets me select which kind of tests I wanna run. I also know that if I have slower tests I can sort them with MSTest so I can see when the faster ones are over. That certainly is only a hack and as you have more and more tests, it gets a total mess.li listrongRun tests sequentially.strong When I say sequentially I dont mean that they depend on each other, I just mean that as I have to test the GUI I cant have 2 tests running at the same time.li listrongHave the option to have several tests depend on each other.strong This means that if I have a test A that fails, in some situations, Id like to not even try to run tests B or C.li listrongHave some kind of support in Visual Studio for all of this.strong I currently am always doing CTRLBCTRLR, A build  run tests.

Negative 1082 pIt would seem like this should be something easy, but Im just not having any luck.p  pWhat I want to be able to do is use core motion to keep track of where the phones camera is being pointed at for a sort of augmented reality app.  The user would point the phone to a reference point as if taking a picture of it and hit a button to align the phones position with the object.

If the phone is held vertically long axis up then the deltaAlt works fine.  As long as the phone is pointed at the horizon alt  0 , then the deltaAzm is correct as well.  However, if the phone if pointed say 45 into the sky, then as I move the phone in azimuth, the altitude component is changed as well.  The two are intertwined in a way I cant understand.p  pIs there some simple math that I need to tease these apart  Again, I would think this would be a necessary need for an augmented reality app, but Ive been unable to find any examples that do this.p

Negative 1082 pI am new to this forum and not a native english speaker, so please be nice p  pstrongHere is the challenge I face at the moment I want to calculate the approximate relative coordinates of yet unknown points in a 3D euclidean space based on a set of given distances between 2 points. In my first approach I want to ignore possible multiple solutions, just taking the first one by random.strongp  pe.g. given set of distances I think its creating a pyramid with a rightangled triangle as a basep  h2P1P2Distanceh2  ul li1230li li2340li li1350li li1460li li2460li li3460li ul  pstrongStep1strong Now, how do I calculate the relative coordinates for those pointsbr I figured that the first point goes to 0,0,0 so the second one is 30,0,0.br After that the third points can be calculated by finding the crossing of the 2 circles from points 1 and 2 with their distances to point 3 50 and 40 respectively. How do I do that mathematically though I took these simple numbers for an easy representation of the situation in my mind. Besides I do not know how to get to the answer in a correct mathematical way the third point is at 30,40,0 or 30,0,40 but i will ignore that.br But getting the fourth point is not as easy as that. I thought I have to use 3 spheres in calculate the crossing to get the point, but how do I do thatp  pstrongStep2strong After I figured out how to calculate this simple example I want to use more unknown points... For each point there is minimum 1 given distance to another point to link it to the others. If the coords can not be calculated because of its degrees of freedom I want to ignore all possibilities except one I choose randomly, but with respect to the known distances.p  pstrongStep3strong Now the final stage should be this Each measured distance is a bit incorrect due to real life situation. So if there are more then 1 distances for a given pair of points the distances are averaged. But due to the imprecise distances there can be a difficulty when determining the exact relative location of a point. So I want to average the different possible locations to the optimal one.p  pCan you help me going through my challenge step by step p
Negative 1082 pTo preserve data integrity, I need to prevent some models from being modified after certain events. For example, a product shouldnt be allowed to be written off after it has been sold.p  pIve always implemented this in the controller, like so pseudoish codep  precodedef ProductsController lt ApplicationController   beforefilter requireproductnotsold, only gt [ writeoff ]  private   def requireproductnotsold     if product.sold       redirectto product, error gt You cant write off a product that has been sold     end   end end codepre  pIt just struck me that I could also do this in the model.

Negative 1082 pDigging into a legacy project C that needs to be extended, I realized that there are about 40 readerwriterparser classes. They are used to read and write various type of data different objects in different files format binary, hdf5, xml, text, ...  one type of object is typically bound to one or two file formats. The classes have for most of them just no knowledge of the others. Interfaces and inheritance were apparently unknown to the writer, as well as design patterns.p  pIt seems to me an horrendous mess. On the other hand I am not exactly sure how to handle this situation. I will at least extract interfaces. I would also like to see if I can have common code in some parent classes, for example what is specific to a hdf5 readerwriter. I also thought that the abstract factory pattern could help but the object I get out of the readers are completely different.p  pHow would you handle this situation  how would you design the classes  what design pattern would you use if any  Would you keep the reading and writing parts splitted  p

Negative 1082 pUPDATE Im using Netbeans and Matise and its possible that it could be Matise causing the problems I describe below.p  pUPDATE 2 Thanks to those who offered constructive suggestions. After rewriting the code without Matises help, the answer offered by emignisem worked as he described. Im still not sure how the code the Netbeans code generator interfered.p  pThough Ive been programming in Java for awhile Ive never done any GUI programming until now. I would like to control a certain part of my program externally updating a jTextArea field with output from an external source without requiring any user action to trigger the display of this output in the jTextArea.p  pSpecifically, I want this output to begin displaying on startup and to start and stop depending on external conditions that have nothing to do with the GUI or what the user is doing. From what I understand so far you can trigger such events through action listeners, but these action listeners assume they are listening for user activity. If I must use action listeners, is there a way to trick the GUI into thinking user interaction has happened or is there a more straightforward way to achieve what I want to dop  pAlso, Id really like to know more about best practices for separating GUI code from the application logic. From the docs Ive come across, it seems that GUI development demands more of a messy integration of logic and user interface than, say, a web application where one can achieve complete separation. Id be very interested in any leads in this area.p

Negative 1082 pOk so Ive been researching this for a while and seems there are a few ways to do this, CSS media queries that detect the screen size, htaccess and javascript.p  pI would prefer to go the htaccess route, because as far as I know, tablets now have 1024px resolution. Wouldnt this interfere with desktop resolutions Also htaccess gives me the opportunity to make a whole new site for tablets and mobile browsers, but how do I go about detecting whether its a tablet or a mobile I dont want to have to detect if its a Google Nexus vs an HTC Desire or iPhone, up against iPad, Acer Iconia, Xoom, etc.p  pIs there a way to detect a tablet, phone or desktop computer, without having to include every single make and model a hrefhttptechnobuz.com201103androiduseragentstring relnofollowfor example as herea.p
Negative 1082 pIm using Rails 3.1.0.rc4 and Im working on doing integration tests with capybaras new Steaklike DSL and Rspec using Devise authenticationp  pThe issue Im having is that when I run an integration test, the racktest driver from capybara seems to just completely lose the users logged in session, in fact, the session seems to just clear out altogether.p  pAfter days of debugging, Im at a complete loss as to why.  Going line by line through the middleware stack, I believe Ive ruled the problem down to something going on in the codeActiveRecordSessionStorecode that is causing this.  Ive read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5000333howdoesrailscsrfprotectionworkherea that Rails will clear out a session if it cant validate the CSRF token, which leaves me to believe that Ive got something configured wrong, and for some reason this one test is not authenticating the CSRF token correctly.p  pThis is what is in my sessionstore.rb in the initializers directoryp  precodeMyAppApplication.config.sessionstore activerecordstore codepre  pDoes anyone who knows about CSRF protection in rails have any leads on why this may be happening p  pAlso, here are some things to notep  ul lithe thing Im trying to test actually works within the browser itself, only this one test is dropping the sessionli lithe session seems to get dropped after the submission of a form to which the action url is to another server.  Im using the VCR gem for capturing the requestsresponses to this external server in the test, and while I believe Ive ruled the external request as the problem, this may have something directly to do with the CSRF token not authenticating, thus clearing out the session.li liother tests involving logging in  using sessions are not dropping sessionsli ul  pCan anyone give me any leads as to what is going on here exactly, and why the one test just seems to arbitrarily drop its session and fail on me  Ive done lots of debugging and have tried everything I can possible think of.p

Negative 1082 pi am loading textures in a background thread and then send the Bitmap to the GL thread via GLSurfaceView.queueEvent... to upload it to the graphics card. to prevent garbage collection after each image load i reuse one Bitmap with power of two dimensions for sending a texture to open gl.p  pand that is the problem, this bitmap gets overwritten sometimes, as the worker thread and GL thread are fighting each other. as i understand it, it is impossible to acquire a lock in one thread worker and unlock it in another thread GL. so i came with a solution like this my thread is a HandlerThreadp  precodepublic boolean handleMessageMessage msg      switchmsg.what          case MESSAGEFROMMAINTHREAD             mLock.lock             loadTextureFromAssetsmsg.obj.toString, msg.arg1             break          case MESSAGEFROMGLTHREAD             mLock.unlock             break           return true  codepre  pwere mLock is a ReentrantLock. but this still does not work and sometimes a texture is repeated or partially overwritten by the next one. it looks like the unlocks are in LIFO order...p  pany ideas except creating a new Bitmap for each loaded texture and causing GC ...it could be solved for almost all cases with having two Bitmaps for loading textures and switching between them, but this is not 100 correct. id like to solve this with proper threads synchronization.p

Negative 1082 pI am using a tabactivity with 3 tabs. Each tab is populated by a activity group. I referred a hrefhttpericharlow.blogspot.com201009experiencemultipleandroidactivities.html relnofollowthis tutoriala for the tab implementation. p  pMy tab initially has a activity A that does some scale animations. On the end of the animation I have started the next activity B. Now when I press back, A gets created again. I want to resume the A activity as I want to reverse the animation I did earlier. p  pThis is the code that gets execute when the back buttons is pressed.p  precodepublic void finishFromChildActivity child      LocalActivityManager manager  getLocalActivityManager     int index  mIdList.size1      if index lt 1          finish         return           manager.destroyActivitymIdList.getindex, true     mIdList.removeindex     index     String lastId  mIdList.getindex     Intent lastIntent  manager.getActivitylastId.getIntent     Window newWindow  manager.startActivitylastId, lastIntent     setContentViewnewWindow.getDecorView  codepre  pFrom what I understood from this code is that they start a next activity and get its decorview. Is there a way to finish the activity and get the decor view for the previous activityp  pI tried many flags in the intents and set launchMode to singleInstance. These method triggered the onResume event of my activity but I got a error that my bitmap is recycled. This is the bitmap I apply animations to. I am including the code for my button handler in activity A.p  precodepublic void gridHandlerfinal View target          target.buildDrawingCache     Bitmap bm  target.getDrawingCache     CustomLayout ghostRow   null     ghostCell  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.ghostgridr0c0     ghostRow   CustomLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.ghostgridr0                                  boxOutAnim  new ScaleAnimation1.0f, 3.0f, 1.0f, 3.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     boxOutAnim.setDuration700     boxOutAnim.setFillAftertrue      If i comment this line I dont get the recycling error.     ghostCell.setBackgroundDrawablenew BitmapDrawablebm      AnimationListener rowListener  new AnimationListener                 Override     public void onAnimationEndCustomLayout cLayout              TabGroupActivity parentActivity                                            TabGroupActivityArtistsActivity.this.getParent             Intent nIntent  new IntentparentActivity,FollowUp.class             parentActivity.startChildActivityFollowUp, nIntent                    ghostRow.setAnimationListenerrowListener     ghostRow.startAnimationboxOutAnim     codepre  pBasically this function just makes a bitmap of the clicked target and does scaling animation to it. I have not written any code to recycle the bitmaps. Any ideas of what might be causing the error.p  pThe other thing I noticed is that, if I do a normal startActivity outside activity group, everything works fine. And get the scaled bitmap when I go back to activity A.    p

Negative 1082 pwhat is the best way to detect escape sequences in ncurses raw mode. p  pThe thing that come to my mind is do getch and then add it to some kind of buffer and then when  the text matches known escape sequence execute appropriate command otherwise ignore the sequence. p  pHowever in this algorithm if i hit an escape sequence that system doesnt know about even if a continue typing other characters they will be considered as a part of escape sequence. Are there any rules of how long the escape sequence can be or some standart characters that end escape sequencep  pOr is there a way of detecting in ncurses when user stopped typing the characters like escape sequence usually come as sequence of characters but i have no way to detect the last character because i have a blocking getch that just blocks when there are no characters from input systemp  plike for example if i press page down and c button i have continuous stream of  escape sequence characters [[6 and then character c. how can i detect between those two that the user pressed first escape sequence and then c character if i dont have a predefined set of known escape sequences   p

Negative 1082 pI have a database that has a scenario where there is a many to many relationship between two tables with a third associative table between themp  pEgp  precodeTable 1  user primary key id Table 2  contactinfo primary key id Associative table userhascontactinfo primary key id, foreign keys userid and contactinfoid codepre  pNow the requirements for the application are to be able to add multiple contactinfo entries on the same page as creating a user recordp  pEg Formp  precodeUserName   Contact Type    Contact Detail Phone           1234567 Email           mehere.com  V       [Add Contact Button]  ... plus more fields for the user table ... codepre  pSo in my example above, I have the username field which would go in the user table, a table of all contact information records that relate to the user in the username field, that would go into the contactinfo table, and then the form elements for contacttype and contactdetails under their respective columns below the table with an add button which would add the contact information to the contact table.  Then below all that, more fields that belong to the user table.p  pIf you are following me so far, the problem I am facing is the client wants this to show on a single form not multi page or separated in two forms, the flow must look like a single form even though the elements will belong to different database tables.p  pSecond, it is simple enough to have the data put into the contactinfo table, however there is no actual userid generated until the rest of the user fields are filled out and the user record is updated, and therefore, I am failing to see how to add the associative record in userhascontactinfo, without saving the user record first and adding the contact info second.p  pFinally, the preference is to avoid javascript though not completely ruled out, because pretty much any solution is going to require either javascript or page refreshes with partial form field data retention and possibly even validation and filter issues  have not gotten that far yetp  pSo my ultimate question is, what is the best way to handle manytomany database table relationships using ZendForm in the scenario above.  I might be overthinking this problem and missing the simple solution here, and look forward to different perspectives.p  pPlease note, this is not a question about how to design the database, rather how to create the zend form to handle the database the way it is designed.p

Negative 1082 pIm working entirely in VBA for Excel.  My solution must be entirely programmatic, and not user driven.

The results of the formulas can be discarded.  a hrefhttpoffice.microsoft.comenushelpexcelformattingandfeaturesthatarenottransferredtootherfileformatsHP010014105.aspxBM4 relnofollowThe Microsoft websitea says p  blockquote   pIf cells display formulas instead of formula values, the formulas are converted as text.

The euro symbol will be converted to a question mark.p blockquote  pThis means the SaveAs function will probably never do what I want it to do, but I need some way to create the file.  Ideally, I would like to keep Excels ability to escape the CSV cells in tact as well.  The CSV files will be read by Java and SQL programs that can properly parse the Excel functions as needed.p

But, were only able to see them if we refresh the page.p  pDoes rails have a mechanism builtin that would allow us to periodically check the database and update the view based on the new changes without refreshing the page Should I be using Jquery AJAX commands If so, how would I implement thisp  pWere using Rails 3.2.1, Ruby 1.9.2 in conjunction with jquery and twitterbootstrap.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1082 pIm developing an HTML5 app for mobiletouch device deployment and are utilising PhoneGap and only targeting the iOS platform for the moment Webkit.p  pMy issue occurs with the CSS3 transitions and it happens to regular jQuery animations as well in that Webkit tends to do some strange things. For instance, in the code available to view a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netlvl99dSjcj relnofollowherea a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netlvl99dSjcj relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netlvl99dSjcja when you step through the pages, going back in the sequence i.e. from page 5 to 1 will render the animation fine, however stepping forward i.e. from page 1 to 5 will produce inconsistent rendering, mostly on the side of ugly remember to view it in Safari. Ive been using Safari 5.1.7.p  pI was originally developing using the jQuery Mobile framework, but the key functionality that I was using was the page routing through hashtags and the transitions, but since I had these issues with the transitions, I tried developing a simpler solution to avoid any JSCSS conflicts with jQM. Alas, its possible that the errors Ive been coming up are actually SafariWebkit related.p  pI originally used codejQuery.animatecode on the left property, to now using CSS3 codetransformcode technique similar to the jQM way of doing things, also to help with speed and test whether it would be more willing to render properly. Both havent worked to varying degrees of unworkingness.p  pFortunately, Firefox renders everything fine. It has no problems, however Firefox isnt the target platform and when the project is compiled within Xcode in the PhoneGap environment, it expresses the same problems that Safari has with it. When I was still using jQM with an earlier development version, Safari would render it fine including Safari on the iPad Simulator, however UIWebView wouldnt. This made me think that perhaps it was a Nitro JS engine issue as in, perhaps UIWebView didnt have the speedpowercapability to render the transition properly  Ive attempted to transfer all animations to CSS3 to relegate the rendering operations to the GPU.p  pIve used various plugins like a hrefhttpricostacruz.comjquery.transit relnofollowjQuery Transita, a hrefhttpplayground.benbarnett.netjqueryanimateenhanced relnofollowjQuery Animate Enhanceda, and a hrefhttptransformjs.strobeapp.com relnofollowTransformJSa. I also tried coding my own custom transition handler within jQM and it didnt render properly although it came the closest worked in Firefox and Safari, just not in UIWebView.p  pIve had inconsistent results regarding transitioning elements with different types of content too video, images, floated elements, multiple paragraphs are all Ive tested. There was at some stage too issues with transitioning tofrom the extreme ends of the sequence i.e. 1 and 5, but now my issue is just that ascending page transition i.e. 1 to 5.p  pIve spent a number of days on this, trying to address this seemingly small issue, but its quite integral to the user experience having slide transitions like this which are contextual based on the direction the user is moving through the app. The easiest solution is to just remove the transitions, but if theres some way to understand what exactly WebkitUIWebView is having trouble with, to create some solution for it. Its no doubt related to the flicker issue jQM experiences with transitions too. A lot of the CSS fixes for those people suggested on the web didnt work either, such as codewebkitbackfacevisibility hiddencode and setting a default transform property codewebkittransform rotateX0code.p

Every time a key is pressed the ajax script searches for a string matching the value of the input field, if the string is found, the script updates a div on the page and sets the value of the input field back to null so that the user has a fresh space to type a new string.  However, if the user types the first string and the script updates the div with the response data and clears the input field value, then the user starts typing again without waiting for a moment or two, any of the text they type into the fieldfor the next two seconds or so gets deleted after they type it in. I simply want to stop their text from being deleted if they are to type a new string in shortly after the first one is validatedp  pHere is the jquery script that updates the div, this is fired by an input with id searchbars onkeypress eventp  precodefunction searchstatus   ifsearchbar.val.length gt 1     .gethttpwww.website.comsubfolderssomephpscript.php,       l status, qsearchbar.val,       functiondata         divtoupdate.htmldata                 codepre  pEDIT searchbar is not inside the div that gets updatedp

A few things has changed for testing using SpecFlow in VS2012. Now it is possible to get functionality in VS2012 that comes closes to the functionality described in VS2010. This is what did the trick for mep  ul liVisual Studio 2012 Update 2 introduced the use of playlistsli liSetting the Test Runner Tool to VisualStudio2012 Tools  Options  Specflow  General  Test Runner Tool gave me te opportunity to run single scenarios by just rightclicking on them and select Run Unit Testsli liInstalling the NUnit Test Adapter let VS2012 discover all my SpecFlow Scenarios and got them to show up in the Test Explorer where they can be put into playlists.li ul  pI hope that this update will help people who where running into the same problems as I was.p

Negative 1082 pLooking for some advice with an iOS application.p  pEssentially what my app does is generate a CSV file that logs certain events within a period of time. So users can press a button and an entry will be added to the log saying Event of type X happened at Time Tp  pThe way Im doing this is by maintaining an NSMutableArray which stores NSStrings. Each event adds a string to the NSMutableArray. p  pWhen the user is done with a session, they can export the file. Im using the NSMutableArrays writeToFile then I use an email interface to send that file as a CSV to a target email. p  pIt all works, except the CSV file that is generated has some metadata in it. Specifically, I believe at the top of the file I see  and  at the beginning of each row of cells when opened in excel. p  pIs this something inherent in the data structure NSMutableArray or data type NSString that I am using Is there a way for me to just get the raw data p  pI can upload code if need be Im not near the work computer now though, so Im testing the waters to see if there is something simple I can do to stop seeing this metadata.p  pThank youp

Negative 1082 pstrongDisclaimerstrongp  pI am in no means an expert in web technology, nor am I too familiar with .asp, .dll and other MS shenanigans, so dont be surprised to find weirdillogical but hopefully meaningful enough constructs bellow.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm working, along with my colleagues, on a IEonly dllpacked .aspx IFRAMEd CRM application. What that was supposed to mean is that its only accessible via IE, and the url is in the form of emhttpinternalipfoobarsomething.dllFOOBARem, and that the page displayed consists of misc HTML background items and two IFRAMEs, containing important application stuff. Being CRM, it requires repetitive actions hundreds of times per day insert new customer, update a customer, lookup various information about them etc.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pEvery one of those actions requires multiple complicated menu navigations through the software in order to finally click on the relevant menu item and wait for the required page to load so complicated, that they are estimated to consume more then 75 of total time spent completing an action.p  pstrongIdeastrongp  pIn order to speed things up and thus increase efficiency I came up with an idea to somehow implement keyboard shortcuts that would act the same way as the click on the menu item does. The idea seems simple enough, but I dont know where to start.p  pstrongAttempted solutionstrongp  pIf it were a standard web page I would create a greasemonkey script that does menuitem.triggerclick when I press ctrlsomething, but I cannot do that for two reasonsp  ol liNo greasemonkey Trixie doesnt work, and  li liCant examine any objects or DOM navigate though them because they are in an IFRAME, so thats as far and as deep as I can go with firebug lite.li ol  pIn order to solve the first issue, Ive managed to open the application with Firefox using IE Tab 2, and sure enough, the application works, but the Greasemonkey scripts dont  even a simple alerta script on page load doesnt execute maybe because the page wrapped in a .dll.p  pstrongConclusionstrongp  pSo it seems to me that I wont be able to push through with my original plan, so is there anything else I could try I have limited access to the remote server where the application is located, and can only peak into the files in hope to catch a glimpse of something that would be helpful, but that is too timeconsuming and probably not fruitful in the end.p  pIm hoping there is a simple enough solution as this should be a pretty common feature to avoid tumbling through hundreds of files or learning how to reverseengineer .dlls. Has anyone been in a similar situation, and if not, how would you try to achieve thisp
Negative 1082 pIm trying to show some connecteddisconnected messages on the status bar in my application. It is a console application written in c, with a Qt GUI. When something changes in the connections status, the connection handler calls a callback in some gui related object, which updates the GUI. I can draw on my QGraphicsScene, but when i try to use showMessage method of QStatusBar, sometimes it crash immediately, sometimes it works until a few calls but the message isnt disappear after the timeout elapsed. I get this error messagep  precodeQObject Cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread. Parent is QStatusBar0xae55feb0, parents thread is QThread0xb3e006f0, current thread is QThread0xb0c00478 QObjectstartTimer QTimer can only be used with threads started with QThread QPixmap It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread codepre  pI think that means the showMessage is not called from the GUI thread. Then how could i display connection status changes on the status bar p

Negative 1082 pHello fellow programmers,p  pIve made a rather complicated WPF application with data bound datagrids and stuff. Since the content changes dynamically, the window itself resizes as well as its supposed to do. I made a function which aligns the window to the center of the primary screen when the size changes, like thisp  precodethis.SizeChanged  delegate            double screenWidth  SystemParameters.PrimaryScreenWidth        double screenHeight  SystemParameters.PrimaryScreenHeight        double windowWidth  this.Width        double windowHeight  this.Height        this.Left   screenWidth  2    windowWidth  2         this.Top   screenHeight  2    windowHeight  2      codepre  pIt works like I suspected it to. However, since the content is data bound, it takes roughly 14th a second before the content is available. The SizeChanged event above already did its job by that time, so the window is not centered at all.p  pCan i implement some sort of timeout before the event is triggered without locking everything upp  pAwaiting your responses patientlyp

Negative 1082 pIve been updating my Mac toolchain in order to take advantage of C11 features and eventually get prettyprint debugging of STL data structures. I used Homebrew to build the gcc 4.7.2 compiler. Ive been able to recompile the source of my current project using this new compiler. However all versions of gdb that Ive tried have various problems when setting breakpoints, viewing source code or viewing local variables.p  pThe version of gdb that I believe is installed as part of the Xcode commandline tools, version 6.3.50, has trouble displaying various templatebased variables. Ive also built and tried to use several other gdb versions 7.3.1, 7.4.1 amp 7.5.1, but each gdb version has problems that make it difficult to impossible to set breakpoints, view source code and view variables. Specifically, these gdb versions dont know the source file or line number of functions defined in header files, breakpoints cant be set in these headerfile functions, and many local variables have been optimized out.p  pHas anybody else experienced these problems, and if so have you been able to resolve them Which versions should I be using in my toolchain in order to avoid these problemsp  pFor the record, my development is on a recent MBP running the latest Mountain Lion updates. My IDE is Eclipse Juno with CDT version 8.1.1. And, yes, Ive code signed all versions of gdb that Ive built and attempted to use.p  pThanks for any input,p  pBobp

Negative 1082 pIm making an autobackup for excel and I cannot find a way to run a sub procedure that starts a timer in my custom addin code.p  pIve found the WorkbookActivate or WorkbookOpen sub but they must be created in the worksheet and not in the addin therefore everyone who would want to use the backup feature from the addin should write that code, which is not manageable.p  pIs there anyway thanksp
Negative 1082 pIm a bit confused about bit architectures. I just cant find a good article that answers my questions, so I figured Id ask SO.p  pQuestion 1p  pWhen speaking of a 16 bit architecture, does it mean each ram address is 16 bits long So if I create an int 32 bit in C the variable would take up 2 addressesp  pQuestion 2p  pin a 16 bit architecture there are only 216 65536 amount of addresses inside the RAM. Why cant they add more Is this because 16 bit cant represent a higher value and therefore cant reference to adresses above 65535p

Negative 1082 pHi I am developing a project where I need to produce a time line sort of a thing where in I need to place images dynamically in a horizontal line depending on the condition. The image instance would differ based on the condition from the data base and the number of instances also would differ. I used an absolute panel to do so and placed the images at a difference of 40 between the horizontal axis keeping the yaxis constant. The images come from a class which  extends Client Bundle as follows.p  precode  public interface TimeLineWidgetResources extends ClientBundle   TimeLineWidgetResources INSTANCE  GWT         .createTimeLineWidgetResources.class  Sourceapplicationconnectionpointbig.png ImageResource getApplicationConnectionPointImage  Sourcebusinessconnectionpointbig.png ImageResource getBusinessConnectionPointImage  Sourcemonitorsmall.png ImageResource getMonitorImage codepre  pp  pI have placed only 3 here but in my resource file i have almost 15 images. The time line looked perfect on the jetty server in IE, Chrome and Safari. But when i create a war and deploy it in tomcat it looks perfect in Chrome and safari but all the images come and get displayed on the screen in IE. if i create 5 instances of it then it is creating 515  75 instances of those images. Can anybody help me with this. What am I doing wrong here Let me post the absolute panel code as well here.p  precode   The method to build Time Line using an absolute Panel   public void buildNewTimeLineGWTTimeLine timeLine

Negative 1082 pIve already got headaches when trying to solve this in my current app Im using iCloud to store my documents  but I cant use UIDocument based storage for the data. So my approach was to follow WWDC 2012 article 237 advanced iCloud document storage and treating my documents like a shoe box app.p  pThe real problem occurs when I build up a NSMetadataQuery to monitor changes in the iCloud document folder to watch out for file changes. Ive setup my query, start it with an observer for NSMetadataQueryDidFinishGatheringNotification and when it fires I enable updates for the query and setup an observer for NSMetadataQueryDidUpdateNotification. The latter only works once for one file change and I didnt find out how to get it fired repeatedly for subsequent changes of the same or other files.

Negative 1082 pI have installed Eclipse on a remote Linux machine and trying to access it from my Windows box thru X11 forwarding. Yes, we have a requirement to do so.p  pIm having a problem with right click behavior when using Eclipse HeliosIndigoJuno.  When I right click in Eclipse the popup menu briefly appears and then whatever menu item the cursor is near gets selected and that action is performed.  If I hold the right click then the popup menu stays open and I can select any menu item.  When I release the right click the selected menu item action is performed.

I am trying to convert an image file to byte[] by using a memorystream to return the memorystream.ToArray However, i have noticed that the image quality decreases after the conversion inputBitmap  byte[]  outputBitmap. outputBitmap has a lower quality than the inputBitmap. My code to convert the image to byte[] is as followsp  precodeMemoryStream mstream  new MemoryStream myImage.Savemstream,System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg byte[] buffer  mstream.ToArray codepre  pand to convert from the byte[] back to an image,p  precodeMemoryStream mstream  new MemoryStreambuffer Image newImage  Image.FromStreammstream codepre  pcan somebody explain why this is and hopefully guide me to correct this problem Note that before i used the inputBitmap as my pictureBox.Image, it looks great in quality. But after converting from byte[] to outputBitmap, setting outputBitmap as my pictureBox.Image becomes kind of blurred and low in quality.p
Negative 1082 pOn the basis of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13391457convertrecursivefunctiontoviewConvert recursive function to viewa, Id like to speed up the retrieval of the path from any arbitrary node in the graph to its root by creating a snapshot of a nodes parents. The idea is that the recursive tree walk is bounded by having intermediate snapshots which avoid any further recursion and hence speed up execution time. I havent performed a load test, so I dont know how this performs beyond this simple example, but early trials already indicate some bottlenecks.

The other part of the puzzle would be to return the content of revisionsnapshot from the revision id where codehassnapshottruecode and join these two results. The problem is how to get this revision id from the CTE. I could store the query result of the CTE in a temp table and query for the revision id, or perhaps its advisable not to write a CTE and write it as a loop instead. This way, one could keep track of the revision id at which the loop would exit when codehassnapshot  truecode. But Im not sure how this would compare against a CTE.p  pWhat do people think about this approachp

Negative 1082 pI have a simple system Im working on that involves serializing user objects.

In this example, I have serializers for 2 types codeintcode and codeNoteNumberArraycode. The storefetch functions do not need any additional state for codeintcode types, the readwrite implementation is very simple.p  pHowever, for codeNoteNumberArraycode, state is necessary so I create my own class instead of using core types or STL types. This state is used by the implementation of codeItemSerializercode emonlyem, for optimization purposes. This private state would be used to optimize the speed and efficiency of the readwrite methods. Since the serializer classes are not stateful, I put this state in the user object instead.p  pI could probably make codeItemSerializercode a friend of codeNoteNumberArraycode, but this would cause a circular dependency and gives codeItemSerializercode access to more of codeNoteNumberArraycode than might be necessary.p  pWhat is a good design for such a system Just looking for some tips to help me get started.

For UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements, for the SQLADD,   SQLUPDATEBYBOOKMARK, and SQLDELETEBYBOOKMARK operations in   SQLBulkOperations, and for the SQLUPDATE or SQLDELETE operations in   SQLSetPos, the value returned in RowCountPtr is either the number of   rows affected by the request or 1 if the number of affected rows is   not available. When SQLExecute, SQLExecDirect, SQLBulkOperations,   SQLSetPos, or SQLMoreResults is called, the SQLDIAGROWCOUNT field   of the diagnostic data structure is set to the row count, and the row   count is cached in an implementationdependent way. SQLRowCount   returns the cached row count value. The cached row count value is   valid until the statement handle is set back to the prepared or   allocated state, the statement is reexecuted, or SQLCloseCursor is   called. Note that if a function has been called since the   SQLDIAGROWCOUNT field was set, the value returned by SQLRowCount   might be different from the value in the SQLDIAGROWCOUNT field   because the SQLDIAGROWCOUNT field is reset to 0 by any function   call. For other statements and functions, the driver may define the   value returned in RowCountPtr. For example, some data sources may be   able to return the number of rows returned by a SELECT statement or a   catalog function before fetching the rows.  Note Many data sources   cannot return the number of rows in a result set before fetching them   for maximum interoperability, applications should not rely on this   behavior.p blockquote  pAnd at the very end of the doco page, we get thisp  blockquote   pIf the last SQL statement executed on the statement handle was not an   UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statement or if the Operation argument in   the previous call to SQLBulkOperations was not SQLADD,   SQLUPDATEBYBOOKMARK, or SQLDELETEBYBOOKMARK, or if the Operation   argument in the previous call to SQLSetPos was not SQLUPDATE or   SQLDELETE, the value of RowCountPtr is driverdefined.

Negative 1082 pI have a mobile app with a comment system, backed by App Engine.  When user A replies to user Bs comment, user B gets a notification.  Everything works over HTTP.p  pRight now I have the client device polling App Engine every minute for updates.  It works but on average, theres a 30second delay before the notification appears.p  pI would like to close this gap by having App Engine send a packet to user Bs device immediately after user A posts the reply.  I can make this happen by moving the codewait60code command from the client to the server  the client will run a tight loop, making another request as soon as it gets a response App Engine sits on every request for 60 seconds before responding.p  pBut if the user gets a notification, App Engine responds before the 60 seconds are up.  Essentially, user As request handler wakes up user Bs sleeping request handler and causes it to return nonnull data.p  pIs there a name for this technique as applied to HTTP  Can it be coded efficiently  If so, how can I implement the waitnotify codep

Negative 1082 pI have already implemented two pretty fast ways of paging a large MS SQL Server database table which contains at least code1,000,000code records, but have failed to determine the pros and cons of either method, advise on either would be greatly appreciatedp  pThe first is to run the SQL query and return only the Primary Key values of the filtered records, specifying a TOP clause of maybe 1001000.  These can then be placed into a session variable on the web server and paged through accordingly by supplying a subset of Primary Key values back to the server.p  pOne positive to this is the filtering of the records only occurs once when the user initially performs the search and secondly it gives the ability to page through the entire record set one item at a time if needs be, such as in previews of upcoming records, etc.  This method also provides some benefits with regards to further filtering already filtered records, as filterable options can be determined by supplying the list of Primary Key values back to the SQL Server  such as common attributes, title, directors, etc.p  pThe second option is to perform both the filtering and paging via SQL Server, supplying variables such as records per page and page number, etc .p  pThe benefit to this is that there is no need to clog up the web server with user sessions that size wise will undoubtedly be at least 1000 bytes each, which will only cause problems in the long run as the number of web site users increases.  In contrast, the down sides are ultimately what Ive listed as being the positives for the first option, such as the lack of the ability to determine filtering options for the whole records set having only a single page or subset of Primary Key values to work with on the web server.p  pWhat are everyones thoughts given the above, especially with regards to storing the Primary Key values for the results in a session variable, memory, alternate options, etcp

Negative 1082 pI have a project branch that was created off of a master branch about a month ago. Im trying to bring in all of the changes from the master branch into the project branch while still keeping the branches separate. I need an end result of a single commit that is a combination of the two branches that I can then push to our gerrit setup.p  pIve tried fetching the latest versions of both branches and then merging the master branch into the project branch. This resulted with a merge commit that joined the two branches. However, I want a single commit with all the changes that will play nicely with gerrit, so I tried rebasing the branch on top of originproject, but this then wanted me to go and merge the 600 commits in the master branch since the two split. Since this is the case, Im assuming pushing the commit at this point will result with gerrit requiring a crazy rebase as well.p  pI also tried rebasing and squashing the project branch on itself down to one commit above the point where it branched off, and then rebasing that one commit on top of the master branch. At the end it gave me a Refs refheadsproject is at [hash] but expected [different hash] error. This approach also would erase the commit history of my project branch, wouldnt itp  pIs there a better way to approach this Am I correct in my assumption that as long as the master branch doesnt have any of the project stuff in it, the next time I try to combine the two, Ill have the same conflictsp

Negative 1082 pI have a tableview with another view called codebottomViewcode as a subview placed at the bottom of the content of the tableview. What I want to happen is, when the user pulls up when at the very bottom of the tableview, upon release I want to slide the tableview up so that codebottomViewcode appears. To do this, I implement the delegate p  precode voidscrollViewDidEndDraggingUIScrollView scrollView willDecelerate BOOLdecelerate      [UIView animateWithDuration0.1 animations         [self.tableView setContentInsetUIEdgeInsetsMake0, 0, 250, 0]     ]  codepre  p250 is the height of bottomView in an animation block. What I expect to happen is for the tableview to slide up 250pts, revealing the codebottomViewcode. Oddly enough, what ends up happening is that the table only slides up a little bit maybe 100pts and does so very slowly, over around 5 seconds, when my animation block was only for .1 seconds.p  pDoes anybody know why this is happeningp  pThanksp

Negative 1082 pIm trying to authenticate with the MtGox.com WebSocket API and after a long while managed to complete the required call attribute of the JSON data. However, I realized that I was using Python 2 to run my codesample and the application the API is finally going to be implemented in is written in Python 3. When I tried to make it work in Python 3 I ran into a couple of problems I was unable to resolve despite several long attempts.p  pI also tried code2to3code, but seems it doesnt have builtin fixers for these kinds of problems.p  pThe API specification for authenticated API calls can be found here a hrefhttpsen.bitcoin.itwikiMtGoxAPIStreamingAuthenticatedcommands relnofollowhttpsen.bitcoin.itwikiMtGoxAPIStreamingAuthenticatedcommandsap  pHere is the working Python 2 script I used for generating the JSON call which I then ran through a WebSocket console extension I found for Chrome.p  precodeimport hashlib import time import hmac import json import base64 import binascii  apikey   apisecret    def nonce     produce a unique nonce that is guaranteed to be ever increasing     microtime  inttime.time  1E6     return microtime  def reqidnonce     return hashlib.md5strnonce.hexdigest  def sendsignedcallapiendpoint, params     nonce  nonce     reqid  reqidnonce     call  json.dumps         id        reqid,         nonce     nonce,         call      apiendpoint,         params    params,           sign  hmac.newbase64.b64decodeapisecret, call, hashlib.sha512.digest     signedcall  apikey.replace, .decodehex  sign  call      return json.dumps         op       call,         call     base64.b64encodesignedcall,         id       reqid,         context  mtgox.com       msg  sendsignedcallprivateinfo,  printmsg codepre  pSome of the errors I ran into related to the no longer existing String.decodehex, Ive had a few others but unfortunately I havent kept track of all of them as I tried a great deal of different approaches.

Negative 1082 pI have a Visual Studio solution and I want to setup project dependencies in following wayp  ul liProject A needs project B during strongruntimestrong. E.g. when someone emBuildsem project A, project B should also be built unless it is uptodate.li liProject A does NOT depend on project B in strongcompiletimestrong e.g. it doesnt statically link to project B etc.. Therefore they can be built in parallel.li ul  pIf I set in Project Dependencies dialog for Project A that it depends on Project B, Project A will be built only after project B is finished building. Because I have about 100 projects in a solution, this significantly slows down build. p  pSo my question is can I setup dependencies in the way that Project A requires project B, but they could compile in parallelp  h2Updateh2  pThe most common case when we run into problem is when someone just forgets to build the solution before launch. When dependencies are set, VS brings up a prompt to build all projects depending on startup project. When there is no project dependency and project B was modified, VS doesnt issue any message to user, and this usually results in nasty runtime errors.p  pAt the moment we are using following workaround project A does strongnotstrong have dependency set on project B, and we set codeProjects and Solutionscode  codeBuild and Runcode  codeOnly build startup projects and dependencies on runcode to false not checked. However, this is a global setting, not a solution option. So I wonder if there is more correct way to solve this problem.p

Negative 1082 pPart of the emfunem of this question is emdefining what a task isem and how it is recorded in git history.p  pWhen you use the a hrefhttpsgithub.comnviegitflow relnofollowgit flow branching modela each developed feature gets its own branch. Then, using the following script which I got from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6191836172690httpstackoverflow.coma6191836172690ap  precodebinsh  From httpstackoverflow.coma6191836172690  NAME11 if [[ z NAME1 ]] then     echo Usage     gitshowmergeancestry.sh COMMITID         This will display the ancestry of the merged in branch.         To list only merge commits, use git log merges. else     git show 1  grep Merge gt devnull     if [[ 0   ]] then         echo Displaying ancestry of merged commit 1         git show 1         git log git mergebase octopus git log 1 merges prettyformatP NAME1..git log 1 merges prettyformatH NAME1 boundary graph prettyoneline abbrevcommit     else         echo The commit 1 doesnt seem to be a merge commit     fi fi codepre  pI can easily look at a merge commit and extract all the juicy information of commits related to the merged branchfeature. However, emshit happensem and sometimes the commits really related to a single taskfeature are actually scattered through more than a single branch. In fact, thats what sometimes I use hotfixes for, patching a feature.p  pIn these situations I emback upem by adding to each commit a strongRefs xxxstrong marker. These kind of marker shows up in github and similar ticketing systems, and is my definitive manual way of tracking changes related to a task. Then the changes related to the task can be extracted with a command like codegit log grep39code which greps the log commits for a specific number.p  pThe question is how can I mix both informations into a single view What I would like is a command which would accept either a strongRefs xxxstrong marker or a commit hash and show all the related information, no matter how scattered through the git history. If the input is the task, it should first grep individual commits, then find out which branches they came from. If the input is a commit hash, it should parse its ancestry logs for strongRefs xxxstrong markers and find out what other commits in the history reference those tasks.p  pSince this is a more complex feature maybe it is implemented in any of the git graphical browsersp

Negative 1082 pIm developing an Webapp. It consists of 2 parts. A node rest server and an angularjs client.p  pThe app is structured this way Rest Server lt Api Module lt Angular Appp  pThe server is currently well tested. I have Unit Tests and Integration Tests. The Integration Tests are accessing a real database and calling the rest api over http. I think this is as high level as it can get for the server testing. The integration tests run fast, too. Im pretty confident that the way I tested the server is sufficient for my use case and Im happy with the results.p  pHowever Im struggling how to test the angularjs app. I have unit tests for the relevant directives and modules. Writing these wasnt an issue.p  pI would like to write integration tests that cover user scenarios. Something like a signup scenario The user visits the website, goes to the signup form, and submits the form with the data.p  pThe angularjs team is moving from a hrefhttpsgithub.comkarmarunnerkarmangscenariongscenariosa to a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorprotractora. Protractor is using Selenium to run the tests. Therefore there are two scopes The app scope and the test scope.p  pNow I can think of three different abstractions I could use. And Im not sure which one suites me best.p  ul liMock the Api Moduleli liMock the Rest Serverli liUse the full serverli ul  h2Mock the Api Moduleh2  pIn this case I would need not to setup a server. All Interactions are running in the browserp  pAdvantagep  ul liNo server is neededli ul  pDisadvantagep  ul liThe api is in the browser scope and I have to tamper with this.li ul  pI really like this solution, but I find it difficult to mock the Api. The Api needs to be modified in the browsers scope. Therefore I need to send the modification from the test to the browser. This a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues31issuecomment21359857can be donea, however I dont see how I could run assertions like codemockedApi.method.wasCalledOncecode in the tests scopep  h2Mock the Rest Serverh2  pAdvantagep  ul liClient would be unchangedli liOnly one scope to deal withli ul  pDisadvantagep  ul liOne has to setup the Rest Routesli ul  pI could create a complete Mock Rest Server in nodejs. Protractor Tests are written in nodejs, thus the control of the server can be done in the test. Before I run the test I can tell the server how to respond. Something like this codeserver.onRequestmethod GET, url .respondWithhello worldcodep  pThen I could do assertions like codewasCalledOncecodep  h2Use the full Server with Databaseh2  pEach test is running with a complete server and can add elements to the database. After each test one can look at the expected elements in the databasep  pAdvantagep  ul liCan be pretty sure, that if these tests are running the app is functional in the tested use caseli ul  pDisadvantagep  ul liI already made a fairly intense integration test with the rest server. This feels like doing the same again.li liSetup depends on the full serverli ul  h2Current Conclusionh2  ul liMocking the Api would separate the server and the client completely.li liUsing a Mock Api would be a higher level test, but would require a fake serverli liDoing a full integration test would give the best reliability, but this is also highly dependant on the server codeli ul  pWhat should I pick What would you dop

Negative 1082 pI have developed a script to upload amp delete images. The images will be saved to a directory like webrootimages. The file names relating to each users upload will be saved in the database when a publish button is clicked. Until then the images will be uploaded in order so that I can show a preview. All seems to work fine except a security vulnerability that allows users to delete other users images. Eg Any user can copy the file name of an image amp inject it to the delete script. Is there any mechanism to prevent this issue.p  pHope this explanation isnt boring, its a little hard to explain.p

Negative 1082 pIm getting images from the camera and I have to account for them being in different orientations. The first approach I took was to use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma542789015055this code snippeta to create a properlyrotated codeUIImagecode. That calculates a codeCGAffineTransformcode and then draws the image using codeCGContextDrawImagecode.p  pHowever, this operation took 23 seconds to complete.p  pThe second approach I took was to just calculate by how many degrees Id have to rotate the image, and whether I have to flip it, and then to apply those rotations before drawing the codeUIImagecode. This approach took a negligible amount of time.p  pTo be specific, Im using Cocos2D, so in either case I converted the codeUIImagecode to a codeCCTexture2Dcode, created a sprite with that texture, and then drew it. In the first case, I created a new codeUIImagecode and had an unrotated codeCCSpritecode. In the second, I used the same codeUIImagecode but had a rotated sprite.p  pWhy is the second approach so much faster The net result is the same a rotated image.

Negative 1082 pI found a bunch of questions regarding similar issues this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11371009parallelmappingfunctionsinipythonwmultipleparametersonea, for example, and the problem with pickling a closure seems to be all around when dealing with iPython.Parallel but I couldnt get around this particular issue anywhere.

The thing is, if I try to create a function that returns the root, it will have to create a closure and pass it to codescipy.optimize.fsolvecode i think.

If I do create a matrix of codebyte[][]code with size codeN  100000code then it throws codejava.lang.OutOfMemoryError Java heap spacecode error.p  pIn this matrix I will store either 0 or 1 at particular codeithcode and codejthcode index. So my use is limited to a bit only and I need a way so that I can just use only 1 bit size per matrix cell rather than over flooding memory keeping 8 bits in a cell where the need is only for 1 bit.p  pHow can I achieve thisp  pPlease take a note that my concern is not increasing heap of JVM, I am just searching for a way to optimally achieve the solution of a Dynamic Problem.p
Negative 1082 pFirstly, heres a bit of backgroundp  pI am developing a 2D game as a personal project possibly for release on mobile devices. I plan on creating a tile based puzzleplatformer with a lot of visual elements.p  pI have never produced anything of this scale before and Im wondering how to stick to good OO principles in a relatively large project.p  pI would like some advice on how to structure some of my code for different types of collisions with different tile types.p  ul liI have solid tiles which my player object can stand onli liwater tiles which still detect collisions but allow the player to swimli libackground elements without any collision detectionli ul  pShould I create a base Tile class with abstract methods so that each tile type can behave differently upon a collision or use different layers for each typep  pI am also wondering how to keep the physics logic of my player object together rather than parts in the tile classes and some in the player object classp  pAs you can see I am quite inexperienced in terms of knowing what works best in certain situations.p  pCan anyone give me some general guidance in these areasp

Negative 1082 pI believe my problem can be considered regardless of used language but, to have some anchor, Ill describe it using the Java language.p  pLets consider the following scenario I have a class strongPickyHoststrong extending Thread and an instance of it, strongpickyHostInststrong running. That class might look like thisp  precodeclass PickyHost extends Thread      private ArrayListltGuestgt guests     public void enterGuest g           deal with g          private void pickGuests           ...          public void run           listen indefinitely       codepre  pMoreover, in the background, I have many strongGueststrong instances running they also extend strongThreadstrong class and once in a while, some stronggueststrong wants to invoke strongenterstrong method on strongpickyHostInststrong with an argument stronggstrong being itself. Now, I want strongPickyHoststrong to be picky in the following sensep  pImmediately after someone invokes strongenterstrong method, it puts stronggstrong at the end of strongguestsstrong list and forces stronggstrong to wait for notification. Also I think here lies the crux of the matter it goes itself for a 5 seconds sleep and somehow allows during these 5 seconds other guests to invoke strongenterstrong method if so happens, then it forgets about how long it had to sleep and resets its alarm clock to sleep exactly 5 seconds again  Ill call it a emsensitive sleepem.p  pAs you can see, the total amount of time strongpickyHostInststrong sleeps can be huge if many guests arrive  like A arrives, then after 4 seconds B arrives, then after another 4 seconds C arrives and so on. However, suppose theres been created a chain A, B, ..., G of guests and from the moment of arrival of G till 5 seconds later, noone arrived. Then I want strongpickyHostInststrong to invoke strongpickGuestsstrong method which, using some algorithm, determines a strongsubsetstrong S of A, B, ..., G of guests to notify that they can stop waiting and carry on doing what they normally do and moreover removes elements of S from strongguestsstrong list. Method strongpickGuestsstrong can take some time to accomplish and in the meantime some guest H might have arrived and invoked strongenterstrong  then strongenterstrong should proceed normally but strongpickGuestsstrong should ignore H and to the end of its last invocation deal with A, B, ..., G  not with A, B, ..., G, H. After finishing strongpickGuestsstrong, strongpickyHostInststrong should here I have 2 ideas  implementing any of them will make me happy  eitherp  ol lifall again into 5 seconds of emsensitive sleepem after which, if no guest after H arrived, invoke strongpickGuestsstrong again, orli lisimultaneously serves guests via strongenterstrong method as usual but invokes strongpickGuestsstrong only after maxa moment when last guest from S from the last invocation notifies strongpickyHostInststrong like the last Thank you, Mr Host from among S, a moment 5 seconds after the last newest guest invoked strongenterstrong.li ol  pFinally, after a long introduction, my question  which tools do I need to accomplish such task Im unfortunately a bit lost among the richness of various locks and multithreadinglocking mechanisms and cant discern which one fits to my problem or which ones, combined somehow.p  pIll greatly appreciate some codesketches that would put me on the right track.p

Negative 1082 pI am trying to Marshal some data from c to a c library.

It was simple enough and indeed does work when I marshal by fixing the IntPtr array...p  precode fixedIntPtr ptr  structArray     InteropCallptr  codepre  pHowever, I soon realized that the c library is actually keeping a reference to the struct and after sometime, expectedly breaks when the array is moved or collected.

Negative 1082 pI am trying to develop a new custom codeUIViewcode to allow for horizontal date selection.  I want to do all the UI design in XIB files.p  pThe custom UI view contains a scrollview and then two week views.  The idea is that as the scrolling occurs, I will move the two week views in place and reconfigure them to the right dates to create an infinite scroll for date selections. p  pI can load the codeUIViewcode, which then loads scrollview and week views all designed in a XIB.  p  pMy DatePickerView class, derived from the codeUIViewcode class does an codeaddSubviewcode of the scroll view which contains the two week views.  The scroll view is 320 wide and the contentSize is set to 640 wide. UserInteraction is enabled. Horizonal Scrolling is enabled.p  pThis all works and displays on the screen.  The week views each contain 7 buttons. I can press them and they get the touch.  However, the scrollview does not seem to want to scroll.p  pI set my custom view to be a codeUIScrollViewDelegatecode.  No calls occur to codescrollViewDidScrollcode.p  pFor each of the week views, I have a container view and then the buttons.  I added the following to the container view again derived from a codeUIViewcode.p  precode voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      DDLogInfoBegan.

Negative 1082 pSo Ive been searching for a solution and reading books, and havent been able to figure it out, the question is rather simple, I have 2 tables. On one table I have 2 fieldsp  ptable1chromosome and position both of the being integers. p  ptable2chromosome start and end, all being integers as well. p  pI want a query that gives me back all rows from table1 that are between the start and end of table2. The query looks like thisp  precodeSELECT      table1 .  FROM     table1,     table2 WHERE     table1.chromosome  table2.chromosome         AND table1.position gt table2.start         AND table1.position lt table1.end codepre  pSo this query works fine, but my tables are many millions of rows 7092713 and 215909 respectvely. I indexed chromosome, pos and chromosome, start, end. The weird part is that if I do the query one by one perl DBI, do one statement for every row of table2, this runs a lot faster. Not sure where am I screwing up. Any help would be appreciated.p  pJorge Kageyamap
Negative 1082 pI have an ASP.NET 4.5, chatty, web application which is hosted on one Large 4 cores 7GB Azure VM. The WEB application is loosely coupled to the data tier via a dedicated WCF Service. The application database is hosted by a dedicated SQL Server instance on another Large 4 cores 7GB Azure VM. The WCF endpoint communicates with the DB VM via an ASP.NET Connection String that employs the DB VM public DNS name  e.g. xyz.cloudapp.net. p  pBoth the WEB and DB VMs appear to be operating in a different subnet but both are in the same Azure location differing second and onwards octet values.p  pWhen running the exact same solution on one Medium 2 cores 3.5GB Azure VM, the latency issues are much lower.p  pI am looking for suggestions on how to reduce the WEB to DB latency as much as possible.p

Negative 1082 pI have a project consisting of various headers and .cpp files. With this I built a shared library with Eclipse and everything is ok. Now I want to use JNA with this C library. I am aware of other maybe easier options than JNA but it is obligatory to use this. I have searched around the web but to be honest I have not found until now a quite easy example to understand what I have to do and go on. I have tested some examples but they only consist of one header and one .cpp with very small functions and are not helpful for me at all. I have also found a tool called JNAerator which is supposed to simplify the procedure if I understand well at least but also the examples for it are limited. So I would really appreciate it if someone could explain me the steps to do this I want C shared library with many headers and .cpp  JNA andor provide me links with examples.p

When the device connects to the internet, I need to read the string in each row, upload it to the a URL using HTTP connect and delete the row and move on to the next row. p  pI am using a Broadcast receiver to wake the app up when the device connects to the internet At the moment it shows a toast message when the device connects to the internet and this works fine. I also know how to upload using the HTTP connect , this part is OK as well. p  pHere is my question How to select the rows from the database one at a time and upload the string in it p  pI was thinking I should do something like get the number of entriesusing codecurson.getInt0code and have a for loop where I increment the row ID and select the rows one at a time but if I do this how do I find the row ID of the first entry. It will not always be 0coz the device may go offline will uploading some of the rows in an earlier sessionp  pI hope my question in clear if not let me know and I will attempt to clarify. p

Negative 1082 pI am writing a program in java in which takes the input from the user as to how many times a given image needs to be compressed, based on which it should compress the image.p  pInitially we convert image into pixel matrix, find the probabilities of each pixel appearing in that matrix and apply huffman code to obtain code in the form of 0s n 1s.p  pNow  if we try to compress it 2nd time we will have only 2 probabilities i.e of 0 n 1.Hence we cant apply the huffman code now.p  pso what can be done in this situationp
Negative 1082 pThere is a class that is annotated with JAXBs codeXmlRootElementcode, but there are some flows which doesnt exploit this annotation and which require high performance. Is there a performance penalty in constructing objects from this class and setting fields as opposed to doing so with the same class without this annotationp

Negative 1082 pI am wondering about some redundant functionality in jQuery and hope someone could shed some light into it.p  pcodejQuery.getJSONcode takes as third argument a callback function for the successful completion of the request, but at the same time codegetJSONcode also returns a codejqXHRcode object which also comes with three callback functions codealwayscode, codedonecode and codefailcode.p  pNow my question is whether there is any semantical difference between passing the desired function as third parameter or as argument to codedonecode also in terms of best practices, respectively if there are any advantages or disadvantages in using either. As for the latter, the only disadvantage I could imagine even though rather unlikely as scenario is a timing issue in case the request is processed faster than the codedonecode call can bind the passed function.p

Negative 1082 pI am trying to build a search page using angularjs. I need to provide some fields check box, radio, age range, etc as filters for search result. For this demo, I am focusing only on check boxes. I have given a demo code in the below plunker listp  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditPMQQzf63uy8Pzq4fVIYQppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coeditPMQQzf63uy8Pzq4fVIYQppreviewap  pSo basically, in the above page, when user selects Yellow then the field show for result 1 should become false. And if the user further selects Circle then the field show for result 2 should be false. The user can select more then one color or shape.p  pThough I have not written the lengthy code, below is pretty much I am thinking ofp  precodewhenever there is user action on filters select or deselect    for each result result 1, result 2, result 3       result.showtrue        The below condition is mn check and hence is a nested for loop.       if none of the selected colors match the colors in the result           result.showfalse        The below condition can be achieved using a single for loop       if none of the selected shapes match the shape of the result          result.showfalse      codepre  pI would like to know any design patterns I can refer to for designing the above function. Also if there are any easy alternatives in angularjs to achieve the above.p  pEdit Actually I want to hide the results that do not match the filter criteria. I used the field show just to demonstrate the example.p

Negative 1082 pI have a partial view in my main page that uses a different model than the main page uses.p  pIn a nutshell what I have is a dropdown control on my main page that uses one model to populate its options. When an option is selected, I have a script that will post the selected option to another action method in the home controller. That method takes that value, and runs a db query dependent on that value. Then I put those results into a model and pass that model to my partial view. The partial view is rendered and then converted to HTML markup and passed back to the script in a JSON object. The script then writes the resulting view markup to a div in the main page.p  pMy problem is that I get an error saying the partial view is looking for one model, when the model its getting is the main pages model  not its own. Is there an easy way I can remedy this I cant wrap both models in another model view model because the two models are passed through different action methods.p  pHeres the relevant code to hopefully assistp  pstrongControllerstrongp  precodepublic class HomeController  Controller       Loaded when page first requested.

Negative 1082 pI have this kind of setup Im trying to use custom eventhandlers for processing a code.datacode hash and to garbage collect its items after handlers had run, to avoid keeping them needlessly in memory, etc. code.defercode function simulates what I got, it generates functions based on provided ones that run asynchronously, trying to mimic native eventhandling that way... brbr Thing that confuses me is that deleting data items, by assigning code...  nullcode, after calling deferred function seems to run before a function gets executed, basically inverting execution order, leaving a function with no data to work with... brbr Heres the script I havep  precode        var defer  functionfunc        get asynchronoused .func version     return function          cache inputs for use by defered function       var args  arguments       var node  this        return setTimeout         function            func.applynode, args                , node              var action  functionnode       process a node     console.lognode[foo][txt]        var data        foo        id   foo,       tag  h2,       txt  stuff,     ,      spam        id   spam,       tag  h1,       txt  and shit,     ,        run .action asynchronously   deferactiondata     garbage collect after   data[foo]  null    this part seems to run before function call    cleaning the data before deferactiondata gets its time    it throws error here because null gced it right away or something      TypeError node[foo] is null     codepre  phr Im currently working around the issue by providing additional function codefinalycode to callbacks that will run the cleanup right after data get processed, which seems quite awkward and unnatural to simple thing..

Negative 1082 pI am using ArcMap to determine the maximum distance from a set of polylines fault lines in Virginia to a set of polygons sinkholes in Virginia. p  pI have tried using some tools in the Proximity toolset but have had no luck.p  pMy initial try used the Near tool, but I was not able to produce an output attribute table field with feet as my linear coordinate. It kept producing outputs in angular degrees, which I am having trouble converting back into linear feet.p  pThen I tried using the Euclidean Distance tool but this did not have an option to input both the sinkholes and the fault lines, so the results was basically a multiple ring buffer raster around the faults.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 1082 pOn my map when you drop a pin it calls DirectionsService to find the route from the previous pin using the latLng of the markers.  That works fine except with dual carriageways, where it essentially treats both sides of the road as separate oneway ones.p  pSo if you click to drop the pin the wrong place  which without zooming in tightly and being very careful you have no control over  you get routes that feature unnecessary loops to change sides of the road.p  pAlthough this seems to me like an understandable and common problem, I cannot see any option to tell the directions service to treat them like a single road, which is how they are drawn on the map anyway.  Nor by searching have I been able to find any references to this problem, which surprised me.p  pSo is there any way this can be achievedp

Negative 1082 pIm creating a web application with a very limited set of users who want to be able to upload local file paths through the use of the file input type.  A healthy bit of research has demonstrated that this is typically undesirable and can be a pretty massive security hole if misused.  Despite that fact, internet explorerversion 11, at leastallows users to configure their browsers such that the genuine local path is included in uploads instead of the fake path that other browsers use.p  pWhile I realize the security implications of allowing the full local path to be disclosed, I was curious if it was possible to override the fake path protection that other major browsers Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari provide.  I dont want to enforce internet explorer use if I dont have to, but if there is no other way, and this feature is that important, I suppose I will.p  pThanks for the help p

Negative 1082 pWhen it comes to parallelising a problem, it involves the division of routines and subroutines between a number of nodes, namely the master node and the slave nodes. Once each of these nodes completes its respective task, all the results from all the nodes are concatenated together to give the final output, hopefully in a shorter time than when using sequential computing methods.p  pMy question is, is there a standard strategy which migrates this method over to the realm of neural networks For example, my initial reasoning was that what would be parallelised in this case would be the feature vector, and each portion of this vector is computed simultaneously, and then concatenated together into one again and the final result will be classified. p  pWould this strategy make sense or would it be better to parallelise the neurons themselves insteadp

Negative 1082 pFYI This is a weird request, but I feel this may benefit other people.p  pIm using a hrefhttpjekyllrb.com relnofollowJekylla and a hrefhttpjekyllrb.comdocsgithubpages relnofollowGitHub Pagesa to publish a website.

As you can see in the generators link, the blue box specifically says that Github actually doesnt support generators, meaning none of my generated files will actually be created by committing to GitHub. This sucks, but isnt the end of the world. p  pMy current very hacky method is to build my site in a codejekyllcode branch in my repo so I can save my codebase, commit those files, copy the generated codesitecode files into a temp folder, switch branches to my codeghpagescode, delete existing files, and copy the generated file from my temp directory into the repo and commit those files so the site will exist publicly. p  pI hate this. I feel like there has to be a better way using codegitcode only. Anyone know how to do this so that I can commit only certain files to one branch and other files to another branch, but same repo Also, if anyone has any better suggestions overall, Id be more than happy to entertain them.p  pThank you.p

All my sounds are done here too but I dont think those are a problem. p  blockquote   pcodeimport flash.media.Soundcodebr   codeimport flash.media.SoundChannelcodep      pcodevar musicChannelSoundChannel  new SoundChannelcodebr   codevar speechChannelSoundChannel  new SoundChannelcodebr   codevar sfxChannelSoundChannel  new SoundChannelcode p blockquote  pAnd heres an example of one of the buttons that causes the 1009 errorp  blockquote   pcodefunction goHomeeMouseEventvoid codebr   codespeechChannel.stopcodebr   codesfxChannel.stopcodebr   codemusicChannel.stopcodebr   codegotoAndPlay2, TitleScreencodebr   codecodep      pcodehome.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, goHomecodep blockquote  pNow what really confuses me is that this same code ran perfectly last night on my computer. I went to test my .swf on the computers at my college and my animation froze, so I checked in Flash and this is what I got. p  pIm also getting the same 1009 error on some TweenMax stuff. And yes I did import everything necessary and all files that are required for these functions to run are in the root directory of the .fla file. I know this because, as with the other error, this stuff worked on my computer at home perfectly. I am running the exact same .fla file and code file I saved on my computer and I do have the com folder and greenstock swc files in the same directory as my .fla, just like on my PC, yet Im stilling seeing 1009 with this p  blockquote   pcodeimport com.greensock.TweenLitecodebr   codeimport com.greensock.TweenMaxcodep      pcodeTweenMax.tomusicChannel, 2, volume0codep blockquote  pAgain this line is referencing a sound channel, so Im 99 sure its the root of these problems. I can swap out musicChannel in this piece of code with Music1 a sound declared in the first frame with the channels and it stops the music fine, but whenever I try to stop sound channels it craps out on me.p  pAgain sorry if this is really simple to fix but Im quite confused because it was working fine last night. The Flash Player could be outdated but its Adobe Flash Player 11 so I dont know if that would be the problem. Right now Im at college so I dont know what version I have at home. p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 1082 pI am building an application that relies on some processing performed by a third party product TPP. The distributors of this TPP recommend deploying it on GridEngine for parallelisation etc...p  pThe interface to this TPP will be a REST API built on Scala amp Akka. p  pAssuming the processing is something akin to handing off processing to a database or similar TPP, would I be be able to achieve this parallelisation using Akka and its Load Balancing, Routing, Cluster and Remote Actor features instead of GridEngine altogether p  pMy understanding of GridEngine is that it provides cluster management tools. It manages load among slaves and you hand it a job to complete and it allocates to an available slave. Is this possibly all achievable using just Akka Would there be any specific reason to go with GridEnginep  pThanksp

Negative 1082 pIm using Jena to read an ontology and its working really well so far. Unfortunately I havent been able to figure out how to use compact uris that Ive defined in the model. Ive defined the prefixes using the models codesetNSPrefixString prefix, String uricode method. When I try to retrieve statements using the prefix, I get nothing. Also, when I do successfully retrieve a Statement, it contains the full uri instead of the compact one that I defined. It will even do it for the xsd uri codehttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemacodep  pFor example, Im using the uri codehttpwww.example.comcode, Ive defined my prefix mapping as codeexcode, and my Statement is codehttpwww.example.comfather httpwww.example.comparentOf httpwww.example.comchildcode where father is the subject, parentOf is the predicate, and child is the object. If I try to retrieve it using codeexfathercode I get no results, and when I do get the Statement back the full uri is there for the subject, predicate, and object. Ive seen it use the prefix instead of the uri when I do codemodel.writeOutputStreamcode, but that isnt particularly helpful for me. Am I able to use the prefix as a substitute for the uri like Ive been trying to do, or is that not something Jena will provide for mep

The MovieClip disappears on contact without the animation happening. p  pThrough debugging Ive learned more. The value of currentFrame starts off going 140 then stays at 40 for the rest of the execution.  So the MovieClip is always on the last frame for every object. p

Negative 1082 pI am trying to brush up a bit on my understanding of binary trees and in particular binary search trees. Looking through the wikipedia showed me the following information a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBinarysearchtree relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBinarysearchtreeap  pBinary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search when looking for a key in a tree or a place to insert a new key, they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, based on the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip over half of the tree, so that each lookupinsertiondeletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an unsorted array, but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables.p  pCan someone please elaborate  explain the following portions of that descriptionp  p1 On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip over half of the tree, so that each lookupinsertiondeletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.p  p2 [from the last sentence] ...but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables.p

Negative 1082 pI need to combine two observables which usually produce values one after the other.  The first sequence lets call it codeSeq Acode produces more values than the second codeSeq Bcode, but usually a bunch of values from the first observable are follewed by one value on the second.  So basically I need to produce a value from the latest value of codeSeq Acode and the latest of codeSeq Bcode.p  pHowever, it can happen that the second sequence doesnt produce a value.  In that case, the combined sequence should still produce a value when after a value from codeSeqAcode and some timeout codeSeq Bcode still didnt produce a value, I need to produce a value from just codeSeq Acode.p  pThe marble diagram should look like thisp  precode                          ltgt Timeout          No timeout Seq A   a1a2a3a4a5a6 Seq B   b1b3 Output  x1x2x3                               I need this        And this codepre  pwhere codeOutputcode basically is some combination of the values.p  pPS I have a hard time explaining the problem consisely, so please excuse the title.p

Negative 1082 pI need to log progress of a project at weekly intervals, but I also need to store expected progress at these intervals for comparison in the future.p  pTypically each project has several tasks of different durations which make up the total duration of the project.p  pWhen a project is first stored, I will know the start and end dates and so I would then store the weekly intervals in a logs table. I can then map this against the tasks to store expected progress at each interval. I then plan to use a cron job to log the actual progress each week.p  pI dont feel easy about this solution. What if the planned dates for the project change If another task is stored and extends the overall duration of the project, the original stored intervals might not match up. Also, what if a task starts midweek This wont match up to the project wide intervalsp  pHow might I execute this within the confines of MySQLp

Negative 1082 pI have a 2D sidescrolling game. Right now, in order to jump, the player must be touching the ground. Therefor, I have a boolean, isOnGround, that is set to YES when the player collides with a tile object, and no when the player jumps. This generates a LOT of calls to didBeginContact method, slowing down the game.p  pFirstly, how can I optimise this by using one big physics body for the tiles on the floor for example clustering multiple adjacent tiles into one single physics bodyp  pSecondly, is this even efficient Is there a better way to detect if the play is on the ground My current method opens up a lot of bugs, for example wall jumping. If a player collides with a wall, isOnGround becomes YES and allows the player to jump.p

I used codeANTLRcode for this.p  pNow that the program is working, I would like to make some sort of plugin which makes use of it.

Negative 1082 pThis may be better suited for stackexchange.com but... I have an ecommerce db built and Im adding subscriptions.

I could put the original codeorderidcode in the codesubscriptioncode table to track the lineage but then it gets confusing as the codeinvoicescode table would have duplicate codeorderidscode. I tried removing the codeordercode and codeorderitemscode and keeping the codeinvoicescode table and adding an codeinvoiceitemscode table to bypass the codeorderidscode altogether but I thought it makes more sense to keep them because people can also buy regular products like tshirts and those are technically an order. Is there a recommended way to structure the tables so that invoices are generated correctly Should orders be for single purchase products and invoices only for subscriptionsp

Negative 1082 pI have a vertical RecyclerView hosted in a CoordinatorLayout featuring a collapsing toolbar layout. The ViewHolder for this RecyclerView contains yet another RecyclerView with a GridLayoutManager. p  pThe reason for this nesting is that the inner RecyclerView displays a collection of pictures that can have anywhere between 1  20 pictures. I dont know how many pictures there will be, but the span of the Grid must always be 3. Every time I bind the ViewHolder I adjust the layout params of the RecyclerView to just accommodate the contents.p  pThis works great if there is no CollapsingToolBarLayout. However, if there is a collapsing ToolBar, scrolling with my finger on the inner RecyclerView does not scroll the Collapsing toolbar, scrolling on another Item however does.p  pTo reemphasize, in the bound ViewHolder, if I begin to scroll on any other item besides the nested RecyclerView, scrolling works fine. However, If I begin the scroll on the nested RecyclerView, then it breaks.p  pIs it possible to prevent scrolling interception on the inner RecyclerView and let only the Parent scroll I would like the inner RecyclerView to still handle clicks however.p  pHeres a YouTube link for the phenomenon a hrefhttpsyoutu.befzj7HmqskzU relnofollowhttpsyoutu.befzj7HmqskzUap  pHere is the XML for the parent

Negative 1082 pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comsgqfz.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsgqfz.png altA ScreenShot From Pagesap  pHere is the screenshot of a view That I hope to get in my ios app.. The ViewControlelr is embedded on a UIScrollView.as you can see, in the beginning there are 4 important UIViews, namelyView1, View2,FixedView and SEARCH. The UIScrollView must have size height limit at FixedView. When the  button is clicked A new View View3 is to be added, bringing FixedView further down increasing the size of the UIScrollView in the process. The Search Button is to be pinned at the bottom of the screen. There is a  button now that would bring the ViewController back to the original state. There is also one more View same idea, add 1 more view, I didnt draw a picture for that. Here is the code for what I have done so far.p  precodeframeForThreethirdGroup.frame frameForFourfourthGroup.frame frameForFixedfixedGroup.frame frameForFixed.origin.x11 frameForButtonsearchButton.frame originalAutoViewviewForAuto.frame thirdGroup.hiddentrue fourthGroup.hiddentrue fixedGroup.frameframeForThree fixedGroup.frameCGRectMakefixedGroup.frame.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y19, fixedGroup.frame.size.width, fixedGroup.frame.size.height codepre  pin ViewDidLoadp  precode IBActionplusInTwoidsender  thirdGroup.hiddenfalse thirdGroup.frameframeForThree fixedGroup.frameframeForFour fixedGroup.frameCGRectMakefixedGroup.frame.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y15, fixedGroup.frame.size.width, fixedGroup.frame.size.height searchButton.frameCGRectMakeframeForButton.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y160, frameForButton.size.width, frameForButton.size.height scrollArea.contentSize  CGSizeMakescrollArea.frame.size.width,1.27  scrollArea.frame.size.height twoPlus.hiddentrue numberOfCities3    IBActionplusInThreeidsender  fourthGroup.hiddenfalse fourthGroup.frameframeForFour fixedGroup.frameframeForFixed searchButton.frameframeForButton scrollArea.contentSize  CGSizeMakescrollArea.frame.size.width,1.44  scrollArea.frame.size.height threeMinus.hiddentrue threePlus.hiddentrue numberOfCities4    IBActionminusInThreeidsender  thirdGroup.hiddentrue fixedGroup.frameframeForThree fixedGroup.frameCGRectMakefixedGroup.frame.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y19, fixedGroup.frame.size.width, fixedGroup.frame.size.height searchButton.frameCGRectMakeframeForButton.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y160, frameForButton.size.width, frameForButton.size.height scrollArea.contentSize  CGSizeMakescrollArea.frame.size.width,1.13 scrollArea.frame.size.height twoPlus.hiddenfalse numberOfCities2     IBActionminusInFouridsender  fourthGroup.hiddentrue scrollArea.contentSize  CGSizeMakescrollArea.frame.size.width,1.27 scrollArea.frame.size.height fixedGroup.frameframeForFour fixedGroup.frameCGRectMakefixedGroup.frame.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y15, fixedGroup.frame.size.width, fixedGroup.frame.size.height searchButton.frameCGRectMakeframeForButton.origin.x, fixedGroup.frame.origin.y160, frameForButton.size.width, frameForButton.size.height threePlus.hiddenfalse threeMinus.hiddenfalse numberOfCities3 codepre  pthirdGroup refers to View3. fourthGroup refers to the View4that is not in the picture i posted as it is the same idea.

Negative 1082 pI am facing a concurrency problem here. I have a codestdmapcode, there is one  occasional writer and multiple frequent readers from different threads, this writer will occasionally add keys key is a codestdstringcodeto the map, and I can not guarantee when exactly the readers perform reading and stop reading. I dont want to put locks for the readers, since reading is very frequent and checking locks frequently will hurt performance. p  pIf the readers will always access the map by keys not codemapcode iterators, will it be always threadsafe If not, any idea how to design the code so that the readers will always access valid keys or codemapcode iterators  p  pOther approaches using different containers solving this problem are also welcome.p

Negative 1082 pIm trying to standardise on log4j for logging in some existing web applications in Tomcat 7, but I cant get it to do exactly what I want.p  pIm setting a codelog4jConfigLocationcode context parameter for each webapp, and the codeweb.xmlcode has a codeLog4jConfigListenercode set up. In itself thats working fine. But, if theres also a codelog4j.xmlcode file in codeWEBINFclassescode, then that gets processed strongemas wellemstrong, and embeforeem the intended file is processed. I found this out by setting the codelog4j.debugcode property.p  pI suspect its down to the order of initialisation of the various parts of the system, but I dont want any legacy config files to clash with the new config files that would cause confusion and delay so how can I make it ignore codeWEBINFclasseslog4j.xmlcode completelyp  pcodeWEBINFweb.xmlcodep  precodeltwebapp

Negative 1082 pIve been working on this issue for over a month now.p  pWhat am I trying to do Get a list of HID devices attached to the system without failure.p  pWhats happening SetupDiGetClassDevs is intermittently returning no devices when filtered for HID devices, but only for the specific process in question. Other processes running simultaneously running the same calls work perfectly. I cannot reproduce this issue in a clean project no matter how hard I try.p  pBackground Im the author of an input system that runs under Unity 3D game engine. A customer of mine is having problems with joystick hot plugging in his gigantic project. On the title screen of his game, everything works swimmingly. Once the first game level is loaded, Windows intermittently and seemingly randomly reports zero HID devices. As long as the current controller is still attached, input works fine, but during these periods of failure, if the controller is removed and plugged back in, Windows returns 0 device interfaces.p  pI do not have access to this customers project over 80 GB, but have injected my own testing code into the executable to try to find the source of the problem. I have over a thousand customers and only this project seems to have this issue.p  pHere is some testing code Im using in a C DLL to query the number of HID devices in the system.p  precodeint EnumerateDevices   int deviceCount  0  LPGUID guid  LPGUIDmallocsizeofGUID HidDGetHidGuidguid  HDEVINFO deviceInfoSet  SetupDiGetClassDevsguid, NULL, NULL, DIGCFPRESENT  DIGCFDEVICEINTERFACE  if deviceInfoSet  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE       SPDEVINFODATA deviceInfoData  new SPDEVINFODATA     deviceInfoDatagtcbSize  sizeofSPDEVINFODATA     deviceInfoDatagtDevInst  0      DWORD deviceIndex  0     int totalDeviceCount  0     int totalInterfaceCount  0      while SetupDiEnumDeviceInfodeviceInfoSet, deviceIndex, deviceInfoData          deviceIndex  1          SPDEVICEINTERFACEDATA deviceInterfaceData  new SPDEVICEINTERFACEDATA         deviceInterfaceDatagtcbSize  sizeofSPDEVICEINTERFACEDATA         int deviceInterfaceIndex  0          while SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfacesdeviceInfoSet, deviceInfoData, guid, deviceInterfaceIndex, deviceInterfaceData              deviceInterfaceIndex             deviceCount             totalInterfaceCount                   totalDeviceCount          stringstream ssss      ifdeviceIndex  0          ssss ltlt No devices. Last error   ltlt GetLastError ltlt n            ssss ltlt Total Device Count   ltlt totalDeviceCount ltlt  Total Interface Count   ltlt totalInterfaceCount     Logssss.str      SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoListdeviceInfoSet     deletedeviceInfoData  else      stringstream sss     sss ltlt Invalid handle value     Logsss.str   freeguid  return deviceCount codepre  pp  pThe result is always OK with INVALIDHANDLEVALUE never returned. However during certain periods, Windows reports the number of devices as 0. SetupDiEnumDeviceInfo returns false and the error code is 259 ERRORNOMOREITEMS.p  pUnity is C based, so Ive tried both calling this function every frame from managed code and by spinning up a new thread in the C DLL and logging the results. Regardless, every time without fail, during the long load of the first level, devices reported will become 0. And intermittently throughout gameplay, the result will alternate between 6 the number of total devices in the system and 0. Sometimes the 0 result can stick for minutes at a time, and sometimes it will only happen for one frame.p  pWhat makes this problem even more interesting is XInput and Direct Input also will fail at exactly the same times as this code. XInput and DI are selfcontained, but I suspect internally they are making the same Windows function calls. Clearly this issue is not in my code, but I have no idea what could possibly cause this kind of occurrence. I suspect some other plugin is interfering or possibly a lack of memory issue.p  pOther info If I change the call to SetupDiGetClassDevs top  precodeHDEVINFO deviceInfoSet  SetupDiGetClassDevsNULL, NULL, NULL, DIGCFPRESENT  DIGCFALLCLASSES codepre  pI get a valid result return at all times  168. This never varies. None of these are device interfaces however, so I cant use this information. If I add back the device interface filters, I get 0 intermittently. Again, this only happens after a large level has been loaded and the games memory footprint is over 2GB. I have read some issues with Direct Input and running out of heap memory causing it to return a result of OK but with no devices, but as far as I can tell theres no relationship between memory and this issue except for that fact that it NEVER occurs on the title screen when memory is 500MB, only after the level loads past 1.6GB or so do you start seeing it  but again, I have no access to the project to determine if its some plugincomponent in there causing this.p  pJust to restate If I run a parallel process another instance of Unity using a different project simultaneously and watch the logs, I receive the correct value of 6 devices at all times at the very same moment this process returns 0. This same behavior is consistent with Windows HID functions, Direct Input, and XInput. When one fails, all fail. Yet the other processes running simultaneously NEVER have a problem seeing all the devices every frame.p  pUnity is based on an ancient version of Mono, so I imagine there could be issues there, but my attempt to circumvent the issues of Mono by spinning up a native thread to do the testing show that it doesnt really make any difference.p  pHaving worked on this so long, Ive scoured the web for information but cant find anything that remotely resembles this issue.p  pEdit Forgot to mention, this project uses Steam also.p

Negative 1082 pI was wondering whether or not it is possible to tell NetBeans I am running NetBeans 8.0.2 to build a project lets call that Project A that is a dependency of another project lets call that Project B whenever the second project is run.p  pIll try to explainp  pProject A is a library. Project B is a simple test application for said library. Ergo, once I change anything in the library A, I need to build it before I can rundebug the test application B. Oh, both projects are usign Maven but Id prefer a solution that does strongnotstrong involve Maven.p  pFrom time to time it simply happens I forget that I have to build the library and wonder why my changes wont work well, of course they wont, the librarys changes have not yet been built.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong how can I tell NetBeans Id prefer not to use Maven for this to always build the library when I run or debug the test applicationp  pHope you guys can find me an answer to this question, its driving me crazyp  pThanks in advance, feel free to ask if I did not make everything clear.p
