Positive 2595 pIn a swift OS X project, Im trying to register an observer to handle WebHistory Notifications sent from a WebView. I think that the registration process is successful, but when my notification handler should be invoked an uncaught exception is raised specifically, the error message is [projectname.HistoryController didAddHistoryItems] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x600000002420. But HistoryController defines the methodp  pfunc didAddHistoryItemsnotification NSNotification.p  pSo, whats wrong I am really struggling. Ive been fighting against this issue for days now. Ive tried instantiating my HistoryController in various places in the program applicationDidFinishLaunching, viewDidLoad method of my WebView, viewDidAppear method of my WebView and even instantiating it as a global variable, but the result does not change. The observer is registered as followsp  pNSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter.addObserverself, selector SelectordidAddHistoryItems, name WebHistoryItemsAddedNotification, objectnilp  pCan anyone help What am I missingp

Positive 2595 pDRM issue  The normal decryption process is  1.      The player throws a needkey event 2.      Webkit sends the event to Java Script 3.      Call webkitGenerateKeyRequest of Java Script HTMLMediaElement to generate a Request, then interacts with the license server to get the key 4.    Call addkey to send the key to browser webkit, then pass the key to the player. If these steps are completed , the player could play the encrypted videos.p  pOn our platform, the player starts 2 needkey events at the beginning of the video play, and the key is obtained successfully every time. But after about 10 seconds playback, the player will throw the 3rd needkey event, and step 3 is not completed this time, no key can be sent to browser. So the video play has to stop.p  pIs there any conditions according to which YouTube Java Script will implements webkitGenerateKeyRequestp

It works great, except on Sarafi mobile browser.  In this case, there is a horizontal scrollbar that you can use to go and look at the sidebar...and it messes up the whole layout.

Negative 2595 pWhat is the best approach to implementing authorisationauthentication for a Windows Forms app talking to an IIShosted RESTful WCF Servicep  pThe reason I ask is I am very confused, after sifting through different articles and posts expressing a different method and eventually hitting a 650 page document on WCF Security Best Practices a hrefhttpwww.codeplex.comWCFSecurityGuide relnofollowhttpwww.codeplex.comWCFSecurityGuidea I am just uncertain which approach is the BEST to take and how to get started on implementation, given my scenario.p  pI started with this article A Guide to Designing and Building RESTful Web Services with WCF 3.5 a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd203052.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd203052.aspxa and a PDC video on RESTful WCF services, which was great and helped me implement my first RESTfriendly WCF service,p  pAfter I had the service working, I returned to implement security, see. Security Considerations quarter down the page and attempted to implement a HTTP Authorization header as per the instructions, however I found the code to be incomplete see how UserKeys variable was never declared.  This is the point at which I tried to research more on how to do this using a HMAC hash with the Authorization HTTP header, but could not find much on google it led me to other articles regarding messagelevel security, forms auth and custom validators and frankly I am not sure which is the best and most appropriate approach to take now.p  pSo with all that said and thanks for listening up till now, I guess my main questions are,br p  pstrong Which security implementation should I usebr br     Is there any way to avoid sending the usernamepassword with every WCF call I would prefer not to send these extra bytes if a connection has been established at the beginning, which it will be before subsequent calls are allowed to be made after login.br br     Should I even really be concerned about anything other than plain text if I am using SSLstrongp  pAs said, .NET 3.5 win forms app, IIShosted WCF service, however what is important is I wish any and all WCF services to require this authorization procedure however it should be, session, http header or otherwise as I do not want anybody to be able to hit these services from the web.p  pI know the above post is large but I had to express the route I have already been down and what I need to accomplish, any and all help is greatly appreciated.p  pPS I am also aware of this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions141484howtoconfiguresecurerestfulserviceswithwcfusingusernamepasswordsslHow to configure secure RESTful services with WCF using usernamepassword  SSLa and if the community suggests I move away from REST for WCF services, I can do this, however I started with this to keep consistency for any public APIs to come.p  pI think its important I state how I am accessing my WCF Service contacting the service is working, but what is the best way to validate credentials  and then return the Member objectp  precodeWebChannelFactoryltIMemberServicegt cf  new WebChannelFactoryltIMemberServicegt                 new UriProperties.Settings.Default.MemberServiceEndpoint             IMemberService channel  cf.CreateChannel             Member m  channel.GetMemberuser, pass codepre  pCode that was half implemented from MS article and some of my own for testingp  precode public Member GetMemberstring username, string password              if string.IsNullOrEmptyusername             throw new WebProtocolExceptionHttpStatusCode.BadRequest, Username must be provided., null         if string.IsNullOrEmptypassword             throw new WebProtocolExceptionHttpStatusCode.BadRequest, Password must be provided., null          if AuthenticateMemberusername                      WebOperationContext.Current.OutgoingResponse.StatusCode  HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized             return null                   return new Member  Username  goneale       codepre

Negative 2595 pI am writing a clientserver in linux kernel Yes. Inside the kernel. Its design decision taken and finalised. Its not going to changep  pThe server reads incoming packets from a raw socket. The transport protocol for these packets on which the raw socket is listening is custom and UDP like. In short I do not have to listen for incoming connections and then fork a thread to handle that connection.p  pI have to just process any IP datagram coming on that raw socket. I will keep reading for packets in an infinite loop on the raw socket. In the userlevel equivalent program, I would have created a separate thread and kept listening for incoming packets. p  pNow for kernel level server, I have doubts about whether I should run it in a separate thread or not becausep  ol lipI think read is an IO operation. So somewhere inside the read, kernel must be calling schedule function to relinquish the control of the processor. Thus after calling read on raw socket, the current kernel active context will be put on hold put in a sleep queue maybe until the packets are available.

Negative 2595 pIm writing a library for manipulating bond graphs, and Im using the Boost Graph Library to store the data for me.  Unfortunately, I cant seem to figure out how to implement a proper visitor pattern using it, as you cant subclass out vertices  you must rely on properties instead.  The visitor framework provided in the library seems heavily geared towards working with certain algorithms where vertices are all of the same type, but store different information.  In my problem, the vertices are of differing types and store differing types of information  some vertices are resistors, while some are capacitors, etc.  How do I go about writing a visitor pattern that works based on a property of a vertex, instead of the vertex itselfp  pMy only thought so far has been to write a small class to represent the type of an object that points back to the original vertex that I need to get the graph information.

Negative 2595 pSimple issue, actually. Just curious if others recognize the problem and perhaps have a working solution for it...p  pI have a simple XSD file which I use to define a configuration file that is used by my application. I need to bind this schema to my project and this is done using the XDBW. In Delphi 2007, this wizard would just recognise an XSD as a schema and thus I would get perfect code for my schema. I recently upgraded to Delphi XE and I want to recreate this code again, just for the fun of it. I could use the old code, so no problem there. I just want to see if DXE had added some improvements. Unfortunately, DXE interprets the file just like any other file and generates code that would help me to create this schema from code. CLANK Thats the sound of my head hitting a wall... I dont want that I want code to generate the XML that is described by the schema So, is this problem familiar for other users Any solutions yetp  hr  pOne solution is to just use the D2007 source files. Thats not an answer, though, since I need to do this exclusively from DXE.p  hr  pAnother solution is by renaming the xsd file to an .biz extension. But this is an extremely ugly hack...p

Negative 2595 pI am adding a bunch of boxes into a UIView inside of a UIScrollerView. The content of the UIView goes beyond the bottom of the devices screen and should cause the whole scene to scroll.p  pHowever, this isnt happening. The content gets added but the scene will not scroll. I assume it has to do with UIKit not automatically resizing the UIView container to match the overflowed content I can understand why, so I tried setting the new bounds rectangle with [container setBounds CGRectMake0, 90, 768, 23020], with the 20 being the number of boxes the height of each is 230. When I do this, nothing appears at all...p  pAnyone know why the content doesnt reappear or does anyone have another solution for making the UIScrollView scrollp

Negative 2595 pI am wondering if there is an intelligent way to design a C dll such that you can later rebuild it and use the new version as a dropin replacement in a safe manner.  Safe mostly means the signatures dont change.p  pI was contemplating the differences between using a database primarily via LINQ vs using it primarily with stored procedures.  On advantage of stored procedures is that you can change any individual stored procedure without doing a recompilerepublish of your application.  So, I was contemplating what it would take to have a similar ability by creating a solution where all of the databaseoriented code was in a separate project using fun stuff like dbml files and whatnot .  Obviously if you stuff garbage on the inside of one of your replacement LINQ functions, the replacement will cause issues, but this disadvantage exists.p  pThe main sort of rules I came up with are justp  ul liIf the database model changes, it is time to do a recompile.li liProtection against any of the signatures changing.  No existing public methods should be removed.li ul  pMy intuition is that a big part of doing this would involve the use of an interface that was referenced by the separate project and used by the main project in order to make all the calls.p  pSo, does this idea make sense Are there any strategies that should be used to make this reasonably safe i.e. without adding much new risk beyond that associated with editing stored procedures without rebuilding an applicationp

Negative 2595 pI am trying to set up a project to develop an iPad application for the company I develop for. I am relatively new to iOS development and just recently got a not too old, not too new either iMac. My problem is that it is not intelbased and therefore I cant install the latest SDK on it. Not to mention that the new Xcode requires intelbased processors too. I have been doing some digging and found the possibility of running OSX and its applications through a virtual machine. Everywhere I have been searching for alternate options, this is the only other I can find. My question is is it better or more recommended to develop iOS applications using a Mac vs using a virtual machine If so, what makes it better to develop on one as opposed to the other option Personally I am about to just tell my boss to get a couple of intelbased macs, but I need to back my suggestion up.p

Negative 2595 pThere was a lot of excitement about Smarty 3 and its new lexer and how much more power it would give you as a template designer, but when it actually hit the shelves as it were, it was a real disappointment how slow it was.

Not good.  p  pBut it did get me thinking, why do you need to implement a fullblown language parser in PHP when it already has modules like DOMDocument, SimpleXML and the like available to it  p  pAre there any template engines for PHP that are based on the XML extensions andor DOMDocument  If so, what is the performance like  If not, then has anybody attempted to write one  p  pOne drawback I can forsee is it would only really be useful for XMLbased formats such as XHTML and RSS.

Negative 2595 pI am in the process developing a PHP5 extension that that calls a Java class using JNI. The Extension and the core functions doing this are ready so far and work like expected in a single threaded per process environment. So using the extensions class functions in php script on commandline phpcli works without any problem. Now using that PHP extension as a apache module I experience problems in creating the JVM through JNI. The first call using the module works fine, the second call while first call running and also after the first call has finished the JVM is not created and returns a code less 0 codeJNIERRcode. As I found out, it is a restriction that I only can have one JVM at a time per process. I test and run my module running apache with just one worker using the codeXcode switch.p  pMy design of the module in the current stage is like thisp  ul liThe extension constructor creates the JVM and makes some initialization.li liThen I have a few methods to call and work with the java class like passing parameters, etc and to execute some methods of the java class.li liMy extension destructor frees all resources used and destroys the JVM formerly created in the constructor.li ul  pWell, first I thougth, that all would work out, but it does not. Not in the way like it is implemented for now. So I am a little stuck on ideas how to get this problem solved.p  pMy questions are Where should I create the JVM and how can I call it the JNI Env properly in a threaded environment  PHP as a Apache Module. I think I have to create the JVM somewhere using codeJNICreateJavaVMcode at module initialization and then use codeAttachCurrentThreadcode  codeDetachCurrentThreadcode  What happens, if another thread tries to attach to to the JVM thread, but there is already another Thread attached to it Do I have to make some locking mechanism here Or create the JVM in a extension class method, call inside that method all Java related methods and destroy the JVM at the end of the same extension class method I do not like this idea at all. Even though I think it does not solve the problem of multiple JVM per process.p  pI hope things do not get too complicated.p  pSo, basically, my problem is where to implement JVM creationdestruction calls and how to access the JNI Environment to call the Java class methods. Last but not least, is that anyways possible what I am trying to accomplishp  pSome development details My platform is LinuxUbuntu Lucid 10.04 LTS, using Apache2 and PHP 5.2.16 compiled from source. The module and core functions are developed in C, the Java JRE is 6.0.22 Oracle download.p

Negative 2595 pIll start with the ultimate question In C with gcc, is it possible to get the values of codefunccode or equivalently, codeFUNCTIONcode stored in a section other than code.rodatacode or wherever codemrodatacode points or subsection thereofp  pThe full explanationp  pSay I have a logging macrop  precodedefine LOGfmt, ... loginternalFILE, LINE, func, fmt, VAARGS codepre  pThe string concatenation operator codecode used in that unary context consumes the preceding comma if and only if the codeVAARGScode list is empty, thereby allowing use of a format string with or without arguments.p  pI can then use the macro normallyp  precodevoid myfunctionvoid      LOGfoo     LOGbar p, ampbar  codepre  pmight print obviously depending on the implementation of codeloginternalcodep  precodefoo.c201myfunction foo foo.c202myfunction bar 0x12345678 codepre  pIn this case, the format strings codefoocode and codebar pcode and the preprocessor strings codefoo.ccode and codemyfunctioncode are anonymous read only data, and they get placed into the code.rodatacode section automatically.p  pBut say I want them to go to a different place Im on an embedded platform running almost everything from RAM for speed, but memory constraints are pushing for moving some things into ROM.  Its easy to move codeFILEcode and the format stringp  precodedefine ROMSTRstr extensionstatic const attributesection.romdata char c[]  str const char ampc define LOGfmt, ... loginternalROMSTRFILE, LINE, func, ROMSTRfmt, VAARGS codepre  pYou cant put an codeattributecode on an anonymous string, so the codeROMSTRcode macro gives it a transient name, affixes it to a specific section, then evaluates to the starting address, so it can substitute cleanly.  This doesnt work if you try to pass a codechar code variable to codeLOGcode as your format string, but Im willing to exclude that use case.p  pNormally, anonymous strings that happen to be identical get combined by the compiler into a single storage location, so every instance of codeFILEcode in one file would share the same runtime address.  With the explicit naming in codeROMSTRcode, each instance will get its own storage location, so it probably doesnt actually make sense to use it on codeFILEcode.p  pHowever, I would like to use it on codefunccode.  The problem is that codefunccode is not the same kind of magic as codeFILEcode.  From the gcc manual, Function Names as Stringsp  blockquote   pThe identifier codefunccode is implicitly declared by the translator as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function definition, the declarationp blockquote  precodestatic const char func[]  functionname codepre  blockquote   pappeared, where functionname is the name of the lexicallyenclosing function. This name is the unadorned name of the function.   ...   These identifiers are not preprocessor macros.  In GCC 3.3 and earlier, and in C only, codeFUNCTIONcode and codePRETTYFUNCTIONcode were treated as string literals they could be used to initialize char arrays, and they could be concatenated with other string literas.  GCC 3.4 and later treat them as variables, like codefunccode.p blockquote  pThus, if you wrap codefunccode with codeROMSTRcode, you getp  precodeerror invalid initializer codepre  pand if you try to put a section attribute before or after the use of codefunccode, you getp  precodeerror expected expression before attribute codepre  porp  precodeerror expected  before attribute codepre  pAnd thus we loop back to the opening question Is it possible to get codefunccode stored in a section of my choosing  Maybe I can use codefdatasectionscode and do some linker script magic to get code.rodata.func.code excluded from the rest of code.rodatacode  If so, what is the syntax for globbing with exclusion in a linker script  In other words, somewhere you have a code.rodatacode  I could put a code.rodata.funccode somewhere else, but I would need to modify the original glob to exclude it so I dont get two copies.p

Negative 2595 pIm fairly new to both Git and Ruby, but Im wondering if this situation is an appropriate time to use Git submodules, or if I should use a different approach.p  pIm working on a Sinatra project. Theres a gem I would like to use with the code hosted on Github. I need to make some changes to the gem for my project. Basically, the gem is for working with a certain file format, and the source Im using doesnt conform to certain standards for this format. I think it would be easier to adjust the gem rather than try to fix the files. I dont think the changes Im making would be of any use to most other people, so I wasnt planning on forking the project.p  pWhat I was thinking of doing was adding a submodule to my project for the gem project, and then making my changes in there. I dont plan on ever needing to push any of these changes to a separate repository, but I thought it would be nice to be able to pull any changes the authors of the gem make to merge in with my changes if they add any additional functionality.p  pDoes this seem appropriatep

It doesnt use the t parameter  this is just so the url is different, so the image reloads.p  pThis works fine on the page where the user uploads their new avatar, but elsewhere on the site it will still use the cached image.p  pI could turn off caching for user avatars, but I dont really want to do this. Is it possible to force a particular cached image to reloadp

Negative 2595 pI am working on an iPhone game and would like to set it up to download configuration data so I can put up a build and then I or my teammates can make changes and just rerun the game rather than rebuild and for nonprogrammers, redistribute the build.p  pThis is basically an easy thing to do, I can set it up to download from a public Dropbox or FTP using NSURL no problem.p  pHowever, we are using GitHub for revision control, so it would be nice to download the file from GitHub and then we get the advantages of having configuration data under revision control without having to manually copy the file to a share when its modified need to commitpush obviously but thats already part of the workflow. Note that I dont need to check the file out or do any actual revision control operations on it as it wont be modified by the app, I just need the app to acquire the latest revision of the file.p  pGitHub allows webbased browsing of repositories, so it seems like this problem should reduce to downloading a file from a URL, but since our repository is private Im not sure how to handle the authentication. It looks like the NSURLConnection class can handle authentication, but Ive tried to set that up and I cant get my file. Im honestly not even sure if this is possible with GitHubs authentication system. I unfortunately do not have much of an HTTP or Web development background, so for me this is a situation where I dont know what I dont know about approaching the problem.p  pI searched around a bit on Google and SO and was surprised I didnt find any straightforward examples of doing this sort of thing, I figured downloading application data from source control would be a pretty common thing to do the GitHub private repository part obviously makes it a bit special but it seems like everyone is using GitHub these days.p  pThanks for any help.p

Again, thats part of the site that I cant control.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  function getTablesdRef   var d  document var dMid  d.getElementByIdmainContent var dTabs  dMid.getElementsByTagNametd      Attempts to load table cells...   for var i  0 i lt dTabs.length i        Attempts to detect the specific cell type...     if dTabs[i].className  bodyTextSmall          Attempts to locate the parts inside this cell...       var myNodes  i.ChildNodes    This part runs, but I cant get ChildNodes.length to work          Attempts to notify the user...       alertdTabs[i].className      i            window.onload  getTables  ltscriptgt codepre  pSo, now Ive switched to jQuery, and Im getting the same problem.  I can tell what image is where, but I cant do anything to the image itself.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function getTables        Locates the correct container for images...     mainContent img.eachfunctionidx, item          var tImgs  item.src         if tImgs.indexOfds. gt 0              window.alerttImgs             this.appendHere is a message about the image.  nothing happens here                   window.onload  getTables  ltscriptgt codepre  pAgain, this jQuery code responds by responding to any image that has ds. anywhere in the src.  I cant get anything else to happen.  I do know that img.append will affect EVERY image, so the script is capable of doing something.p  pThis has now become a case of getting more than what I want or nothing at all, and its really starting to get on my last nerves.p

Negative 2595 pSo Im developing this web application in Django. The exact web framework doesnt matter, but the point is We have a nice separation between code, data and the actual HTML. The further we go however, the more we find wed like to keep on a single web page and make the interface respond to user actions via AJAX requests. Now I find myself writing all these handler functions which expect a particular input from the AJAX request and construct large parts of the page by basically concatenating strings and data. Suddenly its 1999 again and Im manually creating HTML strings. This cant be itp  pSo my question is, whats a decent patternframework... to create HTML on the browser side in a systematic fashion Im aware there are some templating plugins for jQuery, before I commit to one of those however I wonder if there isnt a more fundamental approach to this problem that cant be all that rarep

Negative 2595 pI have a first draft for an extension method on IQueryable with an override for GroupBy which should group by a named property. p  pBefore you ask, Im not using the Dynamic Expression API aka Dynamic Linq because I couldnt figure out how to access a count for each group with that.

Parameter name expressionp blockquote  pI notice that its expecting an codeIEnumerablecode generic rather than an codeIQueryablecode, which is strange. But a pretty good tip. You cant cast codeIEnumerablecode to an codeIQueryablecode without doing an codeAsQueryablecode. The question then is, why is it giving me an codeIEnumerablecode instead of an codeIQueryablecode An why isnt it failing in the same way when I pass in a propertyName for a string propertyp  pI should mention that my codeIQueryablecodes are instances of codeNhQueryablecode, from NHibernate, that is.p

Negative 2595 pI want to use Facebook as an authentication source for my application a website users. I do not want my application to have anything but basic and email permissions. Thus, my application must not be able to publish to a users wall for example. In other words, I want to restrict the allowable set of values for the scope parameter and I want this restriction to occur on the applications configuration pages on the Facebook site itself.p  pNormally this would be easy, just specify email for the scope parameter of the OAuth URLcall.p  pHowever in this case there is another factor and this is a hacker may gain access to the app and change the OAuth call to specify more permissions. Then an unsuspecting user will typically or at least possibly grant those permissions and the hacker will be able to grab the OAuth token and perform actions on behalf of that user.p  pIm not interested in discussing the whys of this issue, just in finding of there is a way to specify that my application can only use a specific set of values for the scope parameter. Ideally this specification of the scope restriction be done in the application configuration page on Facebook itself.p  pHowever, I am interested in alternate solutions that involve using SAML, OpenID or some other authentication only mechanism even if I cannot get the users email address. Im not interested in using RPX.p  pPlease note this is a complex question not a simple one. I have searched far and wide for an answer and have just found what amounts to the opposite of this question.p

Negative 2595 pI have a NSStatusItem that displays a NSPopover which contains a NSTextField but the text field isnt editable although it has been so be so in Xcode. Now this is a known bug and there is apparently a solution someone posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7214273nstextfieldonnspopover77943247794324herea. I really need to work around this bug.p  pIll just quote the answer here for conveniencep  blockquote   pThe main problem is the way keyboard events works. Although the NSTextField and all his superviews receives keyboard events, he doesnt make any action. That happens because the view where the popover is atached, is in a window which cant become a key window. You cant access that window in no way, at least I couldnt. So the solution is override the method canBecomeKeyWindow for every NSWindow in our application using a category.p blockquote  precodeNSWindowcanBecomeKeyWindow.h interface NSWindow canBecomeKeyWindow  end  NSWindowcanBecomeKeyWindow.m implementation NSWindow canBecomeKeyWindow  This is to fix a bug with 10.7 where an NSPopover with a text field cannot be edited if its parent window wont become key The pragma statements disable the corresponding warning for overriding an alreadyimplemented method pragma clang diagnostic push pragma clang diagnostic ignored Wobjcprotocolmethodimplementation  BOOLcanBecomeKeyWindow      return YES  pragma clang diagnostic pop  end codepre  blockquote   pThat makes the popover fully resposive. If you need another window which must respond NO to canBecomeKeyWindow, you can always make a subclass.p blockquote  pI dont really understand what I am supposed to do. Do I just create these two files     NSWindowcanBecomeKeyWindow .h and .m and that will do it Because it doesnt work for me.p  pI am not sure about this but does this only work if I am actually using an NSWindow that displays the NSPopover I am not using a NSWindow, how can I get the NSTextField to be editablep  pThanks.p

Negative 2595 pSo I have this huge tree that is basically a big switchcase with string keys and different function calls on one common object depending on the key and one piece of metadata.p  pEvery entry basically looks like thisp  precode else if  strcmpkey, keystring  0      classnameobjectgtdosomething  else if  ... codepre  pwhere codedosomethingcode can have different invocations, so I cant just use function pointers. Also, some keys require object to be cast to a subclass.p  pNow, if I were to code this in a higher level language, I would use a dictionary of lambdas to simplify this.p  pIt occurred to me that I could use macros to simplify this to something likep  precodecasecallkeystring, classname, dosomething casecall  ...   codepre  pwhere codecasecallcode would be a macro that would expand this code to the first code snippet.p  pHowever, I am very much on the fence whether that would be considered good style. I mean, it would reduce typing work and improve the DRYness of the code, but then it really seems to abuse the macro system somewhat. p  pWould you go down that road, or rather type out the whole thing And what would be your reasoning for doing sop  pstrongEditstrongp  pSome clarificationp  pThis code is used as a glue layer between a simplified scripting API which accesses several different aspects of a C API as simple keyvalue properties. The properties are implemented in different ways in C though Some have gettersetter methods, some are set in a special struct. Scripting actions reference C objects casted to a common base class. However, some actions are only available on certain subclasses and have to be cast down.p  pFurther down the road, I may change the actual C API, but for the moment, it has to be regarded as unchangeable. Also, this has to work on an embedded compiler, so boost or C11 are sadly not available.p

Basic column state is codeperm  [0,1,2,3,4]code column 3 is hidden and column 0 is the checkbox. Now I have a custom context menu which I use to finally give me a perm array of code[0,1,3,2,4]code I have read in the documentation that the permutation array needs to start with 1, is this right When I try using remapColumns functions of the jqgrid and pass the perm array, it works fine. But if I try hiding and showing columns a couple of times, the column order is getting messed with. Please help me understand what these indices for the permutation array stand for Are they column indexes for visible columns Should hidden columns be part of array What happens in case of frozen columns In some examples I have seen codeperm  [01, 13, 22, 31]code What is the correct way I am using codegrid.jqGridremapColumns, perm, truecodep

Negative 2595 pIve been working for a while on a program I am writing in C that runs an MCMC using functions from the GSL. Ive read a lot of the GNU documentation and the writing R extensions, and Ive read plenty about using RcppGSL, but it seems to me to be easier to write in C and then dynamic load the function into R. I have seen many sources describing how to build the function on Windows, but everything I see on how to use it on Unix based systems is that it is relatively straightforward and simple however I can not get it to work. p  pThe C script I am dying for someone to get to work is an easy one. Its simply to take an array with a given number of rows and columns, turn it into a gslmatrix, then turn it back into an array This is essentially what my program does anyway except for the whole changing what the entries are. The C script isp  precodeinclude ltR.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltgslgsllinalg.hgt  void simple int n, int rows, int cols    int r,c   int Cols  cols This step, and the step below it are unnecessary except for readability   int Rows  rows   gslmatrix  m  gslmatrixalloc Rows, Cols  Declares a gslmatrix m of size Rows x Cols    for r  0 rlt Rows r     for c0 clt Cols c       gslmatrixsetm,r,c, nsizeofintColsrc  The array is organized by rows, sets matrix values    for r0 rlt Rows r     for c0 c lt Cols c       nsizeofintColsrcgslmatrixgetm,r,c  This return matrix values to the array should be the same as before  codepre  pWhat Ive done is made sure that my terminal Mac OS X and R share the same directory that simple.c is saved to.

Negative 2595 pThere are hundreds of array topics in all the programming forums. maybe even thousands. daily. But none of them touch upon this aspect. p  pBecause arrays are indexed from 0, i often still enter access my data starting at one. the reason being the zero fields usually work well as holding totals of columns or rows, as well as status flags, instead of a plethora of named variables. It always makes better sense reading it because the fourth entry in is visible as 4, not 3. Some people call the Ground floor of a building 1 and the next storey up 2 or Second floor. Others call the First floor above Ground as 1 and so on. People get lost in buildings because of this. In the demanding world of CAD anything that interrupts a train of thought, no matter how minor is a disruption, equal to a loss of income. Therefore i like arrays comprehensibly as close to the natural conceptual model as i can get it.p  pso the first question is,.. Is this acceptable practice and if not, why not Even though im the only one reading my own code, i rarely share it, i think there is value in not straying too far from convention.  At least if i go on my own bloodyminded way im clear on the reason why.p  pthere are a few more questions, and while they could be deserving of their own thread, they all relate to each other in some way so ill lay them out as wellp  pI also find that there are often parts of arrays that are redundant, because in the real world for which your software is to be used those cases dont arise. So question two rather than have a large array, is it acceptable practice to rethink the data usage into smaller likeforlike arrays where these dead areas are minimized how it relates to the question above is that this would be yet another set of zerozero fields which may become superfluous in themselves. I know there is a sentiment of .. hey theres plenty of memory but somehow I have a view thats just sloppy thinking.p  pand my last question Occasionally im adding an offset to my indices to cater for extra dimensions dealing with user historyp  precodeprintf   s t d n, foo[i],bar[i][c] printf   s t d n, foo[i],bar[i][c1] printf   s t d n, foo[i],bar[i][c2] codepre  pso im worried about a couple of things here. Is doing a calculation at each access a speed hit  In the world of mobile apps, does this represent some battery usage that could have been avoidedp  p for the benefit of any beginner reading this, four dimensional arrays and up are easy to comprehend if you think of a three dimensional array as a Rubiks cube. Put another cube or two alongside it within the room you are seated in and you have four. the building full of rooms is the fifth and so on for city blocks of buildings being six, states of cities 7, countries, etc and up. p
Negative 2595 pIs it possible to vary the output cache in MVC based on certain values in the session Ive read a lot about using the varybycustom functionality and overriding GetVaryByCustomString in Global.asax but the session is not available at this point.p  precodepublic override string GetVaryByCustomStringHttpContext context, string custom       if custom  somekey           Want to check the session here but it isnt available.       return base.GetVaryByCustomStringcontext, custom  codepre  pI understand this is because the Session isnt created until later in the request pipeline.p  pMy concern is that without varying the cache based on the users session, the page which changes based on what the user has in the session, has additional HTML specific to that user etc will get cached as the URL is the same and served by our load balancer, proxy servers etc. and then served to other requests with other peoples session information on the pagep  pThe reason the URL is the same is that the user comes in as a guest, enters some information POST, this is validated and stored in the session and then they are redirected back to the same page which should now be specific to the user based on the session data.p  pThe page itself should be cached normally because if a guest visits the same URL, it should serve the same standard page every time.p  pIs is possible to vary the caching in this wayp

Negative 2595 pOK, this one is rather complicated to explain, which explains the verbose title In my Objective C application I generate a JSON string to hold all of my properties for the objects I need to draw in the ARchitect browser of the wikitude SDK as far as I know the Wikitude SDK only handles JSON viap  precodeNSString javaScript  [self convertPoiModelToJsonself.poiData.pois] NSString javaScriptToCall  [NSString stringWithFormatnewData, javaScript] codepre  pOne particular object I am interested in is stored as a string in that JSON string, its the URL to an image. However, this image is behind a password protected area on our webserver and the app handles the authentication.p  pThe problems start when I am in the ARchitect Browser, which is basically a .html file with calls to specific wikitude javascript functions to build the augmented reality world and show it in a UIWebView in the app. I want to show that image when a POI in the augmented view is clicked in the footer popup which is a basic html div container. So now I have a URL to an image resource on the webserver, which I cannot directly access withp  precodedocument.getElementByIdthumb.src  jsonObject.thumbUrl codepre  pbecause of the authentication needed and the only way I was successful to load that image was via the codevar poiImage  new AR.ImageResourcejsonObject[i].iconURL, onError errorLoadingImagecode method but then I can only display it in the augmented view but not in the footer.p  pI tried it with providing a static string from some other image in the web or to local resources to the img element in the footer section in the view without problems like that codedocument.getElementByIdthumb.srcmarker.pngcode and it works fine, also the image is correctly loaded in the augmented view.p  pI have read about encoding the image which I can access and download in the objective c part of the app in base64 and storing that string in an additional JSON property to load it into the src property of the html img element with a codeltimg srcdataimagepngbase64,BASEampENCODEDDATAgtltimggtcode but this seems like a really dirty and overly impractical workaroundhack for what I try to accomplish. Also I dont know if its a better idea to start reading about how to implement the authentication to access that image in the protected area of the webserver or rather begin implementing the ugly base64 encoding or continue searching for alternatives.p  pIm not asking for a solution but rather for suggestions what possibilities I have left to access that image.

Negative 2595 pI am working on getting validation from Facebook users to access their basic information on the app Im building. I am using the PHP SDK and the Javascript SDK. The Javascript is to call up the login screen and the PHP is to then take the data and store it in a MySQL table to use around the app.p  pIts an app where you can vote on things and I have it set so the vote button is a facebook login button if the user is not validated with the app. Everything works great up until the point where they login. It successfully logs them in on a popup login dialog as normal but I cant get the parent window to refresh successfully to reflect the changes. Basically the only way to get the user information is if they log in and then manually refresh the app. It then sends all the data correctly.

Negative 2595 pThis is an unexpected issue Ive run into. Im writing a GUI application, and I use two classes from the GUI library a Model class and a View class. The Model contents are rendered by the View class to the screen. At some point I decided to derive the Model class because I needed extended functionality. The librarys classes are meant to be derived and I found many examples. It was easy and workd perfectly.p  pNow theres a problem the Model class offers methods for direct editing of the model data. I dont want these methods to be public because I wrote wrappers, and these wrappers have to be the only way to edit. I do need the inheritance because my derived MyModel overrides many virtual methods of the Model class. So I was thinking what to do. Heres a summary with all detailsp  ul liTheres a BasicModel class which offers methods for iteration through the model datali liTheres a Model class, which inherits BasicModel, and extends it by also offering methods for editing the data I think BaseModel is abstract and has no data, and Model defines internal data structures and implements the iteration interface offered by BasicModelli liTheres a MyModel class which inherits Model. It overrides many virtual methods, has extended editing mechanism and wants to hide the lowerlevel editing methods offered by Modelli liTheres a View class which stores a pointer to a BasicModel object. Thus the View uses only the iteration interface, and doesnt even know about any editing interfaces.li ul  pSo I want to keep MyModels iteration interface public, so that I can pass it to my View object, but hide the editing interface offered by Model.p  pstrongSolutions I thought ofstrongp  pemSolution 1em Inheritance cant be avoided because I have to iverride virtual methods, but the solution itself doesnt have to use inheritance I can write a wrapper to the MyModel class, which offers access to a emconst referenceem to the encapsulated MyModel object and offers wrappers to MyModels editing mechanism. It may be ugly because of all the wrappers, but it avoids messing with multiple inheritance and access specifiers.p  pemSolution 2em Have MyModel inherit Model. No multiple inheritance. Now go to MyModels class definition in MyModel.hpp and write method declarations of all Models editing methods, under codeprotectedcode ir codeprivatecode, so that theyre hidden. This works very well, but theres one little problem with maintenance If in future versions of the library, the Model interface changes, e.g. a new editing method is added, well have to add it manually to the MyModel class as a privateprotected method. Of course I can track the librarys changes, or at least go to its online API reference and have a glance at the Model class reference page, just to make sure nothings changes, or update my code if necessary, before a productionstable version of my application is released.p  pemSolution 3em Use multiple inheritance, and then I have no idea whats supposed to happen. Is it safe or not. Is the behavior compiler dependent or not. This is the idea MyModel inherits from Model and from basicModel codepubliccode inheritance from BasicModel for the iteration interface and codeprotectedprivatecode inheritance from Model in order to hide Models editing interface.p  pstrongNotesstrongp  pemNote 1em My highlevel editing mechanism emusesem Models lowerlevel editing methods.p  pemNote 2em The virtual methods MyModel overrides, some of them are defined by BasicModel thus inherited by Model too and some dont exist in BasicModel and are defined by Model e.g. methods related to dragndrop.p  pemNote 3em The GUI library I use is stronggtkmmstrong, the C binding of strongGTKstrong, and the classes Im talking about are GtkTreeModel, GtkTreeStore, GtkTreeView and my own MyModel class, which derives from GtkTreeStore. I ignored these names because the question is a general OO planning question, but Im mentioning the real classes here so that people who are familiar them will understand the problem much more easily. p  pIm not sure what would be the best design here. Definitely solution 3 is the one with the lowest maintenance cost. Its actually zero, because the inheritance access specifiers just do all the work automatically. The question is, does solution 3 always work as expected, e.g. for an iteration method, will compilers make it public because of public inheritance from BasicModel or private because of private inheritance from Model, which is derived from BasicModel. I never used multiple inheritance like this...p  pstrongPseudoCodestrongp  pThis is more or less how the library worksp  precodenamespace GUI       class BasicModel             public            iteration interface for observing the model            iterator getiter            but no data here, its just an interface which calls protected virtual methods            which are implemented by deriving classes, e.g. Model       protected               virtual iterator getitervfunc  0           virtual void handlesignal             class Model  public BasicModel                 inherits public iteration interface           implements observation virtual methods from BasicModel          virtual iterator getitervfunc  ...            has private data structures for the model data           stdvectorltRowgt data           has public editing interface, e.g. insertrow, erase, append           has protected dragndrop related virtual methods          virtual void handledrop        codepre  pMy codep  precodeclass MyModel  public GUIModel        implements virtual methods from BasicModel, e.g. default signal handlers      virtual void handlesignal  ...        implements dragndrop virtual methods from Model      virtual void handledrop  ...        inherits public iteration interface       inherits public editing interface which I want to hide       implements its own editing mechanism      void highleveledit int param  codepre  pstrongExperiment with GCCstrongp  pI tried the following code, compiled with warnings off otherwise GCC complainsp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  class Base  public     void func               stdcout ltlt Basefunc called ltlt stdendl         funcvfunc       protected     virtual void funcvfunc               stdcout ltlt Basefuncvfunc called ltlt stdendl        class Derived  public Base  protected     virtual void funcvfunc               stdcout ltlt Derivedfuncvfunc called ltlt stdendl        class MyClass  public Base, private Derived    int main int argc, char argv[]      Base base     Derived derived     MyClass myclass      base.func      derived.func      myclass.func      return 0  codepre  pFor some reason GCC insists the call codemyclass.funccode is ambigous, but one of the codefunccodes us supposed to be private because of the private inheritance, so I dont understand why it cannot compile. Bottom line, assuming its not a bug but just me not understanding how things work  the suggested solution of multiple inheritance is impossible. The only way to fix this problem, if Im not mistaken, is virtual inheritance, but I cant use it because the classes I use are library classes and they dont use virtual inheritance. And even then, since I use private and public inheritance together, it may not solve the problem and still be an ambigous call.p  pEDIT I tried making Derived and MyClass derive virtually from Base, and it fully solves the problem. But in my case, I cant change library classes, so its not an option.p

Negative 2595 pHaving a really strange experience right now trying to implement responsive CSS media queries on a web app Im working on and just want to see if anyone has any theories on why this might be happening.  p  pHeres some contextp  ul liWorking on a Django app, running on localserver localhost8000 from manage.py runserverli liWas just modifying style.css file and everything was OK.  If I made a change in style.css, refreshed the change, my work looked fine in the browserli liIm testing browser compatibility in Chrome amp Firefox right nowli ul  pSo workflow was proceeding normally until I started writing some media queries at the bottom of the same style.css file.  An example beingp  precodemedia screen and maxwidth 1080px      hero .useractions         float left        width auto       codepre  pAnd heres whats happening in Chrome After I write and save that query, if I reduce my browser width from, say 1200px to 1000px to test the change measured via multiple 3rd party apps, no change  the media queries arent being detected at all.  I dont see the media query in elements in Chrome browser webmaster tools but they show up fine in Firefox and other browsers.  Ive tried 1 clearing my Chrome browser cache, 2 going back into terminal and runningp  precodemanage.py collectstatic codepre  pIve looked at my meta viewport tags, Ive checked my CSS syntax and I dont know why its not reading it specifically in Chrome.  Now, whats bizarre is that if I reduce my Chrome browser size FURTHER down to 965px width or narrower, all of a sudden my maxwidth 1080px media queries show up and start working in Chrome. So its like theres 115px of margin before chrome picks up the media query. Huh Has anybody ever experienced anything like this before Is there some setting in Chrome or something Im not thinking of that might be causing this I looked at a few other posts and saw references to a webkit zoom bug, but thats not the case here.p

Negative 2595 pThis is my first stack overflow question. Normally I dont have to ask because its already been addressed elsewhere, but Ive been trying to figure this out for nearly a week and cant do it.p  pI have maven. p  pSince the guide on the mahout website basically say Installing mahout step 1  you should install mahout, I had to look elsewhere for a guide. I followed the guide here because it seemed simple enough and made sensep  phttp harish11g.blogspot.co.uk201202configuringmahoutclusteringhadoop.htmlp  pHowever, if I dont run p  psvn co a hrefhttpsvn.apache.orgreposasfmahouttrunk relnofollowhttpsvn.apache.orgreposasfmahouttrunka as sudo, it wont work. p  pSimilarly, if I dont use sudo forp  pmvn installp  pIt wont work, failing at the mahoutcore stage of the build.p  pUsing sudo, the build succeeds, but because my useraccount did not do the build root did it when I import the project to eclipse there are errors. Here is a screenshot  a hrefhttpi.imgur.comMEp3lA0.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comMEp3lA0.pnga Can I proceed with using mahout despite these errors, or how can I fix them If I have done something wrong and should reinstall mahout in a different way, Im happy to but I need to know exactly what Ive done wrong.p  pI tried using maven to install mahout in my home directory and it didnt work there either. My thinking was that I wouldnt need superuser permissions to use the directory, so I didnt use sudo. I also tried changing the permissions of opt to allow my useraccount to make changes. It still failed, and Ive had to use sudo again and the eclipse errors are still showing. p  pI dont understand why in every guide Ive seen online this hasnt been a problem. What could be so different about my user account that means I cant simply use p  pmvn installp  pto get mahout downloaded and installedp  pIf anyone could explain this is in a simple stepbystep way that would be amazing, because I really dont know why Im having such trouble with this. Also, Ive only been using Ubuntu in earnest for the past few weeks although I had some experience with it over the past year, never really used it for anything serious for this project, so youll understand if Im not immediately aware of some terminal commands or other linux tricks that to others may seem obvious.p  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 2595 pOn my Control is a TreeView with a set of Items which can be in one of three levels. The Objects inside the TreeView have a property called Level which determines this. Under the TreeView there are some TextBoxes. The TextBoxes should be filled depending on the level of the SelectedItem in the TreeView. If an Item on the top level is selected only the first TextBox should be filled. If an item on the second level is selected the first an second TextBox should be filled and so on.

I could simply call func2 as func2fin.p  pNow suppose that func1 read the file until line 4, and then func2 is called and do its thing, reading the file until line 7. Now this is the problem as soon as funct2 returns to func1, I would like to continue reading the file from where func1 left, that is, line 5, but it isnt possible because fin is now pointing to line 8 of the file. p  pI have already tried defining func2 as func2const ifstreamamp  and  func2const ifstream  or creating a copy of fin inside func1 and passing it to func2, but the compiler will not accept any of these options.p  pWhat should I do Thanks.p

Negative 2595 pIm trying to create a fluid and dynamic interface, and I do love the way Facebook loads pages so that bits of the page are left intact most importantly the chat section, top nav bar and footer, while the content you navigate to gets loaded asynchronously. p  pSo.. What needs to be done in order to achieve such a system What Im thinking, is to have all link requests rerouted through code.htaccesscode to some main hub PHP file that includes whatever content is requested by including the corresponding PHP file that handles that request. So if we were to request codephotoscode in our nav bar, our request would go the .htaccess file, which would reroute the request to some codemainhub.phpcode file which in turn would include our codephotos.phpcode file.p  pBut Im bumping into a few hiccups. If i reroute all traffic to codemainhub.phpcode with lets say this rule codeRewriteRule . mainhub.php [QSA]code then everything images, css, js files etc will also pass through the codemainhub.phpcode file. Thats no good..p  pAlso, just as Facebook has some pages that are not loaded asynchronously, but are properly navigated to like the settings page, Id also like to have that feature. So also there as to be a requirement for some pages not go through the codemainhub.phpcode file.p  pAnother thing Im not sure how to accomplish, is having the sticky content loaded when accessing a specific link. For example codehomecode could be the home page and I could have the sticky bits hardcoded into the codehome.phpcode file, and when the user navigates the website  request other pages and not include the bits that are static. Seems logical. But what happens if a user jumps into another page not the codehomecode page where I have the sticky parts coded, what do I do then..p  pMaybe Im thinking the wrong way with this, so Im hoping some code.htaccesscode  PHP guru could help me out with this.p
Negative 2595 pI am using vaadin to make a web application.  The web application is composed of different views and one main UI page, the UI page is where the navigator is declared and the view pages are added to it.  I have a couple of different views that the navigator navigates to, and each view has a menu panel which is not a view it is a class that I make visible once the user logs in.  Everything works fine when you navigate to the different views you see the menu panel, but when you refresh the page hit refresh button  the menu panel disappears.  p  pI am thinking it is caused by the navigator because it is the only thing that is controlling the navigation between different views, but have not figured out exactly what is the problemp

Negative 2595 pI have recently developed a google chrome extension that uses an NPAPI plugin made using the FireBreath framework.  I just now found out that google will shortly discontinue these types of plugins and eventually ban all existing extensions that use them.  So, I would like to eventually move to the NaCl  PPAPI architecture, but I am not sure if this architecture can even support what I am currently doing in the NPAPI plugin.p  pIn my current NPAPI plugin I am supporting OSX and Windows.  On the OSX version, the plugin executes the system function which executes a small 1 line applescript.  It looks like thisp  precodeosascript e tell app ...  codepre  pOn the windows version, it executes functions in a COM library.  Both versions end up doing the same exact thing.

Negative 2595 pHow do you preserve factored variables in left joins using sqldfp  pI am trying to perform a left join using the sqldf function in R however, the process seems to convert a factored column in my right dataframe to a character class in the merged dataset.p  pI suspect that this is because the left join includes rows from the left dataframe for which there are no corresponding rows in the right dataframe, thus introducing NAs to the factored column.p  pIve created this reproducible examplep  precoderequiresqldf leftDF lt data.frameA  sample115, replace  FALSE,                       B  sampleletters, 15, replace  TRUE,                      stringsAsFactors  FALSE strleftDF rightDF lt data.frameX  sample15, 10, replace  TRUE,                       Y  sampleletters, 10, replace  TRUE,                       stringsAsFactors  TRUE strrightDF mergedDF lt sqldfSELECT l.A, l.B, r.Y                     FROM leftDF as l                     LEFT JOIN rightDF as r                     ON l.A  r.X strmergedDF codepre  pIs this the expected behavior of sqldf The conversion of the factored variable to a character class may not be obvious to programmers until the variable doesnt behave they way they expect in future analyses.p  pI can preserve the factor by first adding an NA level to the factored column prior to the join using addNA however, adding NA as a level seems to be discouraged see warning in addNA.

Negative 2595 pGood afternoon. I have created an application for an introductory java course that allows a user to sort their DVD collection by title, studio, or year. The application also allows the user to add additional DVDs to their collection, thus enlarging their arrays. The code properly compiles, but there is clearly something wrong as the titles, studio, and years are mixing themselves up. To be clear, this code is from a textbook and is part of a lab that requires the use of the exact methods, packages, etc. that you see in the code. Im not asking for advice on how to make the code more efficient although that is welcome as I am learning, but specifically what is wrong with the code provided causing the scramble.

Negative 2595 pI am using ThreeJs to render some STL files in the browser.  I am trying to figure out if I can add parameters to these models, so that I can edit these models using ThreeJs or X3DOM.  For example I have a cube and I want to add a text parameter to this cube. When the text parameter is passed to ThreeJS, it embosses the text on the cube at a specific location.p  pI dont mind converting the STL files to the ThreeJS model Js file or X3D files as long as I can parameterize the rendering to add text to the basic structure.p  pI want to know if anyone has had experience doing this kind of 3D parameterization.p  ol liIs this possible in ThreeJS or X3DOMli liIf yes, then is there any documentation that I could use to achieve thisli ol  pIf these libraries cannot handle this case, then are there any other libraries which can achieve the samep  pEdit My question is more about how I can add parameters to the model itself. Can we have parameters in ThreeJS models themselves, which ThreeJS understands out of the box. Let me ignore the text example, if I consider a simple cube in a model file, is there a way to make Threejs understand its side length as param from the model, and any changes to this param automatically gets reflected into the visualization. I.e. IF I change the side length from 1 to 3, Threejs renders a larger cube. p

Is it possible to use the usemin task on js files or is it a bad idea to rev html templates used by js files in the first place p  pBefore building root    app       index.html       templates            template1.html       scripts            script1.js used template1.htmlp  pAfter building root    index.html    templates         43643.template1.html    scripts         345345.script1.js does not update ref to template1.htmlp  pMy gruntfile is pretty basic, just added directories to the rev task.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2595 pWe have an existing Genealogy site which is not a singlepage app, and over the years weve created a number of jQuery plugins for doing things such as typeahead, various modalbased utilities, and components that are reusable around the site. We arent doing a singlepage app because we are a content publisher, and were not yet confident that search engines will reliably index these in our use case.p  pWe are now looking at adding some more complex widgets that have multiview modal flows. An example for our Genealogy site is that there are numerous cases where a user must select a Person record from a pool of records they are following OR optionally, create a new one.p  pFor example, say you are viewing a person record want to change the family tree relationships on a person. You click on a link and a modal appears allowing you to edit their relationships. We were envisioning a modal flow that looks like thisp  ul lipstrongView 1 Indexstrong A management page that lists current relationships, along with an Add Person pulldown that allows you to select a relationship type Parent, Spouse, Child, Siblingpli lipstrongView 2 Add a personstrong We show a text input field with typeahead support.

Give them a form to give details about the person.pli ul  pIm at a loss for what might be the best solution for this.

Negative 2595 pIm currently working on a benchmark which is part of my bachelor thesis that compares SQL and NoSQL Databases based on an abstract data model an abstract queries to achieve fair implementation on all systems.p  pIm currently working on the implementation of a query that is specified as follows I have a table in Cassandra that is specified as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE allocated     partitionkey int,      financialinstitution varchar,      primaryuuid uuid,     reportname varchar,     viewname varchar,     rowname varchar,     colname varchar,     amount float, PRIMARY KEY partitionkey, reportname, primaryuuid codepre  pThis table contains about 100,000,000 records 300GB.p  pWe now need to calculate the sum for the field strongamountstrong for every possible combination of strongreportnamestrong, strongviewnamestrong, strongcolnamestrong and strongrownamestrong.p  pIn SQL this would be quite easy, just select sum amount and group it by the fields you want. However, since Cassandra does not support these operations which is perfectly fine I need to achieve this on another way. p  pCurrently I achieve this by doing a fulltable walk, processing each record and storing the sum in a HashMap in Java for each combination. The prepared statement I use is as followsp  precodeSELECT     partitionkey,     financialinstitution,    reportname,     viewname,     colname,     rowname,     amount  FROM allocated  codepre  pThat works partially on machines with lots on RAM for both, cassandra and the Java app, but crashes on smaller machines.p  pNow Im wondering whether its possible to achieve this on a faster way I could imagine using the partitionkey, which serves also as the cassandra partition key and do this for every partition I have 5 of them.p  pAlso I though of doing this multithreaded by assigning every partition and report to a seperate thread and running it parallel. But I guess this would cause a lot of overhead on the application side.p  pNow to the actual question Would you recommend another execution strategy to achieve this Maybe I still think too much in a SQLlike way.p  pThank you for you support.p

Negative 2595 pWe are facing one funny and interesting issue with our JBoss app server.p  pThe problem is we are running the JBoss in Linux server which is running in different time zone say, strongAmericaChicagostrong. Also with the same timezone we are starting the JBoss server by setting strongDuser.timezonexxxstrong JVM parameter. Although its running fine as per the configuration for 5 or 6 days. After that the JBoss app servers time zone is getting changed automatically to some other time zone say strongAsiaKolkatastrong. For this we have analyzed lot but we are not able to figure it out and as of now restart of JBoss is required to get things normal.p  pSo I wanted to know, is there any way to restrict this or to reset to old timezone without restarting JBossp

The url a hrefhttpmywebsite.comsubfolderthefileimlookingfor.html relnofollowhttpmywebsite.comsubfolderthefileimlookingfor.htmla keeps redirecting to the 404 error page of my wordpress blog.p  pI guess this is because of the url rewriting of Wordpress.

Negative 2595 pI am trying to build a service that authenticates users using an oauth 1 signed request. The request includes an oauth token, signature, nonce, and consumer key. The server has access to the corresponding secrets, but it is unclear how to use the oauth gem to validate the token and retrieve the corresponding user.

Negative 2595 pIm developing a small codeUITableViewcodebased app in Swift. I started out hardcoding some basic arrays as such included is the basic class declaration and the codeUITableViewcode outlet declarationp  precodeimport UIKit  class ScenesViewController UITableViewController   IBOutlet var myTableView UITableView  var sceneName  [Scene 1, Scene 2, Scene 3, Scene 4, Scene 5] var sceneDetail  [Hi, Hello, Bye, My Bad, Happy] codepre  pThis code is inside a codeUITableViewControllercode which has an outlet that is all hooked up to a codeUITableViewcode. I have created a plist for this called Scenes.plist and have attempted to replace the code. In ObjectiveC, I would do thisp  precodeNSString path  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceScenes ofTypeplist]  NSDictionary dict  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFilepath] sceneName  [dict objectForKeySceneName] sceneDetail  [dict objectForKeySceneDetail] codepre  pI started doing this in Swift like thisp  precodelet path  NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourceScenes, ofTypeplist  let dict  NSDictionarycontentsOfFilepath   Error ScenesViewController.Type does not have a member named path codepre  pI scoured the Internet for a solution but was unable to find one. So I took up the next course of action  an almost onelinerp  precodelet dict  NSDictionarycontentsOfFile      NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourceScenes, ofTypeplist  var sceneName  dict[SceneName]  Error ScenesViewController.Type does not have a member named dict codepre  pNow, the only solution I can almost resort to is having all of that on one line for each arrayp  precodevar sceneName  NSDictionarycontentsOfFile      NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourceScenes, ofTypeplist.objectForKeySceneName  Warning Variable sceneName inferred to have type AnyObject, which may be unexpected  FixIt Add an explicit type annotation to silence this warning var sceneName AnyObject  ... codepre  pSo I added the explicit type annotation just to find out that there were more errors. Inside the codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode functionp  precodeoverride func tableViewtableView UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UITableViewCell      let cell UITableViewCell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierreuseIdentifier, forIndexPath indexPath as UITableViewCell       Configure the cell...      cell.textLabel.text  sceneName[indexPath.row]  Error could not find member row     return cell  codepre  pThere are actually strongtwo errorsstrong I do not know whether this is accidentally duplicated or not. The next errors are in the the codeprepareForSeguesendercode methodp  precodeoverride func prepareForSeguesegue UIStoryboardSegue, sender AnyObject      if segue.identifier  ShowDetails          var detailVC ScenesDetailViewController  segue.destinationViewController as ScenesDetailViewController          var myIndexPath NSIndexPath  myTableView.indexPathForSelectedRow          var row Int  myIndexPath.row          detailVC.detailModal  [sceneDetail[row], sceneName[row]]  Error Could not find an overload for subscript that accepts the supplied arguments       codepre  pAgain, there are two errors however, I believe this is because codesceneDetailcode and codesceneNamecode are both used. There seem to be errors all over the place with reading and using plists in files that arent there or that I havent come across in ObjectiveC.p  pThanks in advance,p  pKodIncp

But how does my interfaces now impact my concrete classes, surely referencing codeIMyEntitycode will mean in the concrete class I have to define the codeIdcode property, but I really want my abstract class to do that to save time.p  pBelow is as far as I gotp  precodepublic class MyEntity  IMyEntity      public Guid Id getset     public string StringProperty getset     public IMyEntity MyEntity2 getset  codepre  pHow does using an abstract class work Does it still work or is there another programming method I have to implementp  pI thought maybe this would workp  precodepublic class MyEntity  PrimaryKey, IMyEntity      etc, but no Id field this time  codepre  pHow would this work in my repository, I use interface with genericsp  precodepublic interface IRepository      TaskltListltTgtgt AllAsyncltTgt     TaskltTgt FindAsyncltTgtExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt[] params   public class Repository  IRepository      public TaskltListltTgtgt AllAsyncltTgt              return dbContext.SetltTgt.ToListAsync            etc  codepre  pWould it have any impactp  pIm doing this because I want to abstract out the service core and domain model into a new project and use this project between the ASP.NET front end and a WCF Service. The service need only use one entity at the moment but this maybe increased at a later date.p

Negative 2595 pIm working on a project which requires me to operate at a low level on Windows drives, and am doing so primarily using Windows API calls.

Negative 2595 pSo, the question at hand is about initializing the lazy collections of an unknown entity, as long as these are known at least by name. This is part of a more wide effort of mine to build a generic DataTable  RecordDetails miniframework in JSF  Primefaces.br So, the associations are usually lazy, and the only moment i need them loaded is when someone accesses one record of the many in the datatable in order to viewedit it. The issues here is that the controllers are generic, and for this I also use just one service class backing the whole LazyLoading for the datatable and loadingsaving the record from the details section. What I have with come so far is the following piece of codep  precodepublic ltTgt T loadWithDetailsT record, String... associationsToInitialize      final PersistenceUnitUtil pu  em.getEntityManagerFactory.getPersistenceUnitUtil     record  T em.findrecord.getClass, pu.getIdentifierrecord     for String association  associationsToInitialize          try              if pu.isLoadedrecord, association                  loadAssociationrecord, association                       catch ..... non significant              e.printStackTrace  Nothing else to do                   return record   private ltTgt void loadAssociationT record, String associationName throws IntrospectionException, InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException, NoSuchFieldException      BeanInfo info  Introspector.getBeanInforecord.getClass, Object.class     PropertyDescriptor[] props  info.getPropertyDescriptors     for PropertyDescriptor pd  props          if pd.getName.equalsassociationName              Method getter  pd.getReadMethod             Collection getter.invokerecord.size                   throw new NoSuchFieldExceptionassociationName  codepre  pAnd the question is, did anyone start any similar endeavor, or does anyone know of a more pleasant way to initialize collections in a JPA way not Hibernate  Eclipselink specific without involving reflectionbr Another alternative I could think of is forcing all entities to implement some interface with p  precodeObject getId void loadAssociations codepre  pbut I dont like the idea of forcing my pojos to implement some interface just for this.p

Negative 2595 pI am trying to add an assembly to the cache on Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt. I get this error Failure adding assembly to the cache Attempt to install an assembly without a strong name. I am adding a ListTasks2.dll assembly from a WCF Service App called ListTasks2. I never had this issue with a similarlynamed project, so why is it raising an issue nowp  pNOTE I tried signing it in Visual Studio and it still doesnt work. I wonder if it might be a permission issue. I used different user credentials and was able to add an assembly. The catch is that I loaded a VS Solution, and that project signed the assembly.

Negative 2595 pIm building a webmobile app using Node.jsExpress server on the backend and Angular.js for the frontend. Im using passport for sessions and I have some problems with a client side authorization validations.p  pOn user login the server responses with a json cookie containing some session information like username and role. I want to make angular.js route authorization to limit the user access based on hit role. On every redirection I first check the cookie. If the cookie is there and the users role matches the paths access requirement everything is ok and the redirection is done. If some request from the client side to the server side fails with a Not authorized response the session cookie is deleted and so on...p  pWhat is the problem... There are a lot of session validations on the server side but checking the cookie on the client side isnt very secure. Every one can see the cookie format its a simple json and change it. For example everyone can change the role property of the cookie to admin and only with cookie validation the client side will give access for example to the admins panel view. Access only to the view A further requests to the backend with this cookie will fail but its not good to give them access to the views...p  pThe server uses the SSL protocol but this encrypts only the communication, the stored cookie on the client side isnt encrypted.p  pI was thinking the sent cookie to be encrypted and the client side to decrypt it for authorization validation. But the user can open the clients js files and find out the decrypting key if its stored in a plane text. If the server sends the key to the client side and the client side stores it in a variable the key will be not visible to the user but it will be lost on a page refresh. It will be not very smart to keep it in cookie Dp  pOf course the client side can send authorization request to the server for every authorization validation but this can be a lot of request.p  pCan you propose my some solutionsp  pThank you very much and have a nice day p

Negative 2595 pNow I am trying to implement a particle filter. I am given a wallmounted map, and I try to localize a robot in this map. Based on particle filter method, I initialize 1000 random particles, and in each step, I move these 1000 particles according to a certain movement instruction, i.e. an angleodometry pair. After a move, I calculate the likelihood of the measurements compared to the sensed distance to the wall, and then resample the particles based on their likelihoods. I think this is the basic process for particle filter. What confuses me now is that how should I deal with the situations where some of the particles hit the wall while they are forwarding p

Then I calculate using latitudes, and longitudes of the buildings which of the buildings is the closest one to my current location, and change the model object accordingly.p  pThis all works. The default building flashes in the first html select control, which then changes into the nearest building.p  pHowever, I find it awkward having to inject scope into the controller, when Im using the Controller as syntax, because usually that is not needed. You see, if I take out the scope.apply line, the view does not change. It still shows the default building, even though the vm.selected.building actually contains the closest one. And when I try to select a room from the second html select, the first one updates to the value actually in the vm.selected.building model object.p  pSo, why is this Is there a way to get the desired functionality without the injection p  pEDIT So the real question is Why do I have to call scope.apply here Why does the view not change without itp

Negative 2595 pI am new to SPARQL, OWL and the knowledge base strongYago2sstrong. I have been reading about strongentity linkingstrong which is  basically a process of finding named entities in online textual documents and linking them to the entities in knowledge base like Yago2s. For example if a sentence goes like Page and Brin founded Google, then Page and Brin are linked to entries of LarryPage and SergeyBrin in Yago2s respectively.p  pI have read that there is a relationproperty defined in Yago called emmeansem relation which does this kind of mapping i.e. it gives all possible entities defined in Yago which the phrase detected in the document can mean. eg Obama can mean BarackObama, MichelleObama etc. However, I cant seem to find any such empropertyem defined in Yago2s. But, there is a empropertyem called rdfslabel which kind of does the same thing.p  pI have two questionsp  ol liHas the means relation been replaced by rdfslabel  li liIs there any kind of tutorial or online manual, where all the properties defined in Yago2s are mentioned and defined briefly so that I can have a look and accordingly construct my SPARQL query.li ol  pThanks in advance. p

This is like option 1. except instead of using the tryexcept block to reset the generator I start a transaction and then roll it back if the record fails to post. emI dont know the syntax for using transaction control. I thought I read somewhere that SAVEPOINTSET TRANSACTION is not allowed in PSQL. Plus the roll back would have to happen in the AFTER INSERT trigger so once again I need another trigger.empli ol  pSurely this is an issue for any Firebird developer that wants to use Generators.

Negative 2595 pI have app in production and working. It is hosted on heroku and uses Postgres 9.3 in the cloud. There are 2 databases master and readonly follower slave. There are tables like codeUserscode, codeLikescode, codeFollowingscode, codeSubscriptionscode and so on. We need to store complete log about events like codeuserCreatedcode, codeuserDeletedcode, codeuserLikedSomethingcode, codeuserUnlikedSomethingcode, codeuserFollowedSomeonecode, codeuserUnfollowedSomeonecode and so on. Later on we have to prepare statistic reportscharts about current and historical data. The main proble is that when user is deleted it is just removed from db so we cant retrieve users that were deleted from db because they are not stored in db anymore. Same applies to likesunlikes followsunfollows and so on. There are few things I dont know how to handle properlyp  ol lipIf we will store events in same database with foreign keys to user profiles then historical data will change because each event will be linked to current user profile which will change in time.pli lipIf we will store events in separate postgres database db just for logs to offload the main database then to join the events with actual user profiles we would have to use crossdb joins codedblinkcode which might be slow I guess I have never used this feature before. Anyway this wont solve the problem from point 1.pli lipI thought about using different type of database for storing logs  maybe MongoDb  as I remember mongoDb is more writeheavy than postgres which is more readheavy so it might be more suitable for storing logsevents. However then I would have to store user profiles in two databases and even user profile per each event to solve point 1.pli ol  pI know this is very general question but maybe there is some kind of standard approach or special database type for storing such datap

Negative 2595 pI have an API to consume for a service that provides finance quotations on used cars. My app is written in PHP and I have Guzzle 5 added via Composer.p  pI have used other APIs previously that have take XML or just an Array of POST parameters to send, but this one is more complex.p  pThis API uses DTO objects and the documentation says thisp  precoderelies heavily on DTOs to carry data between client and server. The following sections detail the DTOs. Each web service will serialise and transfer them in their own formatsmethods. It is the responsibility of the client application to correctly construct requests and parse responses. It is suggested that object serialization and deserialization be used for easier usage. codepre  pSo I have no idea how to achieve this with Guzzle. Some of the enumeration types are things such as RequestAssetMotorVehicle. Would you use StdClass or Arrays doing this in PHP Or classes How would I serialise itp  pa hrefhttpguzzle.readthedocs.orgenlatestoverview.html relnofollowGuzzle Docsap

Negative 2595 pIm writing an apache module and I can easily import a simple configuration from apaches httpd config to my C program using a builtin struct, but I want to store a large configuration because I want my module to take action based on a list of items. Part of my module operation will include blocking a set of IP addresses. I understand that this can be done easier via linux iptables and allow and deny directives, but I want to learn this so I can make my module.p  pAt first I was thinking of allocating memory in my program by including these lines outside of all functionsp  precodeline 19 requestrec r line 20 char ubipsm line 21 ubipsmcharaprpcallocrgtpool,1000 line 22 char ubipspubipsm codepre  pand then using memory and pointer throughout my program so I can think I have a large space to work with without causing violation errors. p  pUnfortunately, the above gives errors.p  precodesample.c21 warning data definition has no type or storage class sample.c21 error conflicting types for ubipsm sample.c20 error previous declaration of ubipsm was here sample.c21 warning initialization makes integer from pointer without a cast sample.c21 error initializer element is not constant sample.c22 warning initialization makes pointer from integer without a cast sample.c22 error initializer element is not constant codepre  pI also thought of initializing the pointers inside a function but I dont want apache to overallocate memory. Id rather allocate it once if I can.p  pWhat I do know is that I can check a configuration directive with two parameters in this function. arg holds first parameter and arg2 holds second parameterp  precodeconst char myconfigcmdparms cmd,void cfg,const char arg,const char arg2return NULL codepre  pThis in turn is called from this command inside the apache configuration directives function which is then called by apachep  precodeAPINITTAKE2mydirective,myconfig, NULL,RSRCCONF,a string,NULL codepre  pI want to be able to use memory I think called the heap to store the configuration passed into the myconfig function. If I wanted to use the local stack instead, then Id have this problem solved already by not allocating memory and adding a char[large value] to the list of variables in my struct.p  pApache reads my config from http.conf if it contains something likep  precodemydirective one two mydirective one three mydirective one four codepre  pBut in reality, my conf file will be much larger than that with the same directive listed multiple times and only one parameter changing.p  pIm pretty sure if I keep allocating off of local space the stack to store large items, then Id run out of memory quick.p  pThe amount of memory Im anticipating to allocate is at least 1MB to start.p  pThe perfect explanation as to why so much is that in my module, I want to add a section where anyone with a certain IP address will be redirected to another section of the server without the server doing anything else first including searching for files and writing in the logs. and there could be a list of say 100,000 IP addresses and I think 400KB is too much for a local stackp  pSomeone please advise how I should go about this, and I dont want to use the original malloc command because this is inside an apache module and if apache crashes at any point due to poorly created 3rd party user modules, the allocated memory via malloc might not be freed where as with aprpcalloc, its allocated but automatically freed after.p

Negative 2595 pI spent some time investigating the a hrefhttpshg.python.orgcpythonfile3b920a778484Libcollectionsinit.pyl265codecollections.namedtuplecode modulea a few weeks ago.

Then codeexeccode is executed with the string which represents the code as the argument, and the new class is returned. p  pDoes anyone know why it was done this way, when there is a specific tool for this kind of thing readily available, i.e. the metaclass I havent tried to do it myself, but it seems like everything that is happening in the codenamedtuplecode module could have been easily accomplished using a codenamedtuplecode metaclass, like so p  precodeclass namedtupletype codepre  petc etc.  p

Negative 2595 pApologies for the long title, but I couldnt think of a less specific one which would be clear enoughp  pI need to pass the name of an objectlike macro to a nested functionlike macro, as in the following trivial examplep  precodedefine ROOTFUNCINPUT int v  INPUT  INPUT define CALLERFUNCINPUT ROOTFUNCINPUT  define INTA 1 define INTB 2 define INTC 3 codepre  pNow, if I write codeROOTFUNCINTAcode in my code I get an integer variable called codevINTAcode with the value code1code. If I define a variable in code, codeint INTD  4code, and then write codeCALLERFUNCINTDcode I end up with an integer variable called codevINTDcode with the value code4code.p  pBut if I write codeCALLERFUNCINTAcode I get an integer variable called codev1code with a value of code1code, because codeINTAcode is expanded to code1code at the time codeCALLERFUNCcode is expanded, before codeROOTFUNCcode is expanded i.e. codeROOTFUNC1code is what gets expanded.p  pIf I change line 2 to codedefine CALLERFUNCINPUT ROOTFUNCINPUTcode i.e. stringifying codeINPUTcode, a compiler error occurs because it is being asked to define an integer variable called codev1code an invalid name and give it the value code1code a noninteger value.p  pI know the preprocessor is fairly primitive, but is there any way of achieving what Im afterp  pSecond edit for further clarification, I want codeCALLERFUNCINTAcode to expand first to codeROOTFUNCINTAcode, then to codeint vINTA  1code  i.e. I want codeINTAcode to be expanded inside codeROOTFUNCcode, rather than outside it. I am looking for an answer in principle, not just any way to change codeCALLERFUNCcode to produce the result codeint vINTA  1code, which would be trivial.p  hr  pP.S. In case you are wondering, I originally had a use case involving signal handling e.g. taking macro names like codeSIGINTcode as inputs for nested macros, but got around these limitations by simplifying my structure and abandoning nested macros hence this question is purely academic.p

Negative 2595 pI am an Android programmer developing a simple mobile app very similar to a regular messenger.br I use a clientserver architecture.

There is SQLite RDBMS used as a cache.br Writing a separate application, from scratch, for each unique mobile platform is expensive.

Ive recently installed emacs 24.5 on two different OS X Mavericks machines, once with Mac Ports, once from the tarball. I didnt see html as an option when using Cc Ce in orgmode, so i ran find across the machine installed with tarball and couldnt find htmlize.el. I fetched version 1.43 and put it in my load path html now appears in Cc Ce. This loadpath is mirrored between the two machines.p  pNow when i run Cx Cw at the agenda view, i have a satisfactory html export with the exception of links. They URL includes the close bracket, open bracket and first word of the link text.  codelta hrefhttpsoclc.webex.comoclcj.phpblahblahblah][WebexgtWebexltagtcode Note that the engine is able to figure out the end of the URL because the second word in the link text in the org document becomes its own second link, well formed codelta hrefhttpsdocs.google.comdocumentdblahblahedit][EngineeringgtEngineeringltagtlta hrefhttpsdocs.google.comdocumentdblahblaheditgt Docltagtcodep  pThis annoying behavior occurs on both machines. p  pExperiments on the macports machine result in the following.

Negative 2595 pIn my d3 charts, I sometimes create my nodes with a codeparent.selectAll.datacode. Then retrieve later the created node with codeparent.selectcode to continue changing its children. The issue I face is it seems that d3 is changing the codedatacode of the node when I select it again, it gives it the data of its parent instead of the one I assigned to it in the codeselectAllcode call.p  pI reproduce this issue in a jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdgm4snau2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdgm4snau2ap  pDo I do something wrong How can I select again the created node without overriding its codedatacodep

Negative 2595 pI have been working with MySQL for quite some time and I have just been tasked with building a table that holds restaurant data. I am provided two key information types for each restaurant, a category Fast Food, diners, delis, french, indian, etc. and a cuisine type Gastropub, German, Greek, Grill, Gyros, etc.. Each of these information types can have multiple values. The table is expected to hold 100,000 entries.p  pI will need to be able to query the table by searching for either a cuisine type or category type or both. Should I create a separate table for cuisines and categories and then associate a restaurantid to each row Or for design simplicity should I just make two columns on the restaurant table which hold the cuisinecategory types in comma separated format I know that the latter is widely disapproved of, but is there any chance that it may increase speed because I wont have to join two massive tables when performing a search The data is likely to be modified very little.p

Negative 2595 pI have a web design question that Im trying to puzzle out.  Essentially Im looking to design a navbar such that it will change what buttonslinks are displayed in the navbar based on what type of account is signed in.  So if a standard user is signed up they might seep  pSite Name  Account Settings  Logoutp  pBut if an admin is logged in they would seep  pSite Name  Account Settings  Manage Users  Logoutp  pIm using MEANjs for this website, and I have an idea as to how to implement it, but Im not positive it will work.  Basically in Appnamepublicmodules I think I can make a navbar module, which will have HTML and a controller.  The controller would check what type of user is logged in and with conditional statements display certain links and not others.  Then in any of my views I would just include the navbar module as the top item.  Would this be a good approachp  pAlong these lines, Im having trouble coming up with a way to customize other features based on what type of account is logged in.  For instance, I want to do a standard home page for unlogged in users, say another home page for users that are logged in, and a third homepage for admins that are logged in.  How should this all be handled with MEANjs in terms of file structure  A bit lost here and looking for some light to be shed, so thanks all.

Negative 2595 pI have created Restful APIs in Node.js and now I plan to document them so they can be shared with others. I spent the past couple of days researching in to this and I found a hrefhttpswagger.io relnofollowSwaggera and started exploring what it had to offer. I really like a hrefhttpswagger.ioswaggerui relnofollowSwaggerUIa, It takes a JSON object and generates a document as displayed by this a hrefhttppetstore.swagger.io relnofollowDemoa. Another option is using the a hrefhttpswagger.ioswaggereditor relnofollowSwaggerEditora however this means writing out manually and I am not interested in that.p  pSo basically I feel if I can generate the JSON object based on docstringscomments I write in my api .js files I can then simply pass the JSON in to swaggerUI and have my beautiful document. I was looking for some tool that can help me achieve this. Any tool or tutorial would help out a lot. I have looked at all the tools listed on a hrefhttpswagger.ioopensourceintegrations relnofollowSwagger Open Source Integration Sectiona.p  pPerhaps  I missed something but would definitely appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction. I am not interested in design first approach etc. I already have existing APIs and would like to generate documents for them. I highly appreciate prompt replies from experienced users as I am really stuck on this. I have no sense of direction right now.  p  pstrongAdditional Notesstrongp  pI guess a perhaps a tool that can even help me create that JSON object would be a good idea but I do feel I might have missed something since swagger is so popular I am sure this must be done before. p

Negative 2595 pI have a local SQL Server 2014 Express instance running on a client couple hundred actually. The client syncs data to a server running SQL Server 2012 Enterprise. The infrastructure is something along these linesp  precodeClient gt Master ServergtServer A ampamp Server B codepre  pThe client executes a stored procedure when it needs to sync. The stored proc then hits the master server and tells it that a sync is starting. The master server uses Broker Services to facilitate the sync. p  pWhen sync starts, the master server pulls all of the changed records from the client and stores them in the respective tables on the server. It then takes a subset of that data, transforms it and pushes it to Server A. It then pulls any new data on Server A, transforms it and inserts into the master server. This process is repeated with a different subset of data from the master server to Server B. p  pFinally, the master server pushes all of the new data down to the client, rekeying everything in the process. Since both the client and the master server use identity columns, we rekey to keep them in sync. p  pThere are a few more steps in there, and some additional servers where we do more data mutation. The client basically fires the stored proc and then goes into a syncing... state. We want to give meaningful info back to the client so they know where they are during sync. Initially we were going to just insert update records from the master server to the client as Broker Services ran. The client would then query that table once or twice a second. p  pThen I discovered a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms172133vvs.110.aspx relnofollowQuery Notificationsa and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms190427.aspx relnofollowEvent Notificationsa Im not sure which makes the most sense to use in this scenario. Ive seen how to receive notifications using C what the client is written in, but have not seen how to do this with Event Notifications. p  pHowever, the client app executes a stored proc within the local database. That database then pings the master server. Can I still use one of these solutions it sounds like Query Notification is the way to go if the client uses a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary62xk7953vvs.110.aspx relnofollowSqlDependencya pointing at the local DB Can I Marshall notifications from the master server to the client through the local DBp  pAm I way off base on the direction Im wanting to tryp

Negative 2595 pHi,br  I have an issue, i dont really know what its called. Im using transform, so i can animate a border around a div, when you hover the div. The problem is, that i have transitiondelay, on right, top and left border, it starts from bottom, and the animation takes 1 second, so i have transitiondelay on 1s, and when you hover the div, that animation starts, but what the problem is that if you hover it long enough it reaches the right, top and left border. Then when you mouseleave and then mouseover again, it stops the back animation, so it looks weird that they are halved, and the bottom border is animating.p  precode    .svghoverhover .top          webkittransform translateX300px         transform translateX300px         transitiondelay 2s           .svghoverhover .right          webkittransform translateY240px         transform translateY240px         transitiondelay 1s           .svghoverhover .bottom          webkittransform translateX300px         transform translateX300px           .svghoverhover .left          webkittransform translateY240px         transform translateY240px         transitiondelay 3s      codepre  p What i think of... is when you leave the div with your mouse, the back animation on transform, should continue instead of stopping.p  pIf you mouseout, then the div will look like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6uqCy.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6uqCy.png althalved div after mouseoutap  pAnd then if you mouseover the div again, then the animation starts from the beginning, but from where the bottom border is.p  pWhat i try to, is that i either want it to do the whole animation backwards, or it shouldnt stop the transform when mouseleave and mouseover.p  pLike thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comWXerL.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWXerL.png altanimation backwardsap  pOr then like this, so the borders are transforming back, even you mouseover, then the animation will start over and Transform isnt stopping when mouseover.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7RF43.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7RF43.png altanimation continuesap  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.nets2b4Lyz2 relnofollowDemoap
Negative 2595 pI have a DataGrid in WPF. It binds using MVVM to a ViewModel. It works fine with just DataGridTextColumns that display information regarding my List of objects that the DataGrid binds to.

Negative 2595 pWere creating an application with Entity Framework that deals with data specific to a single user.  The database supports unlimited users so we do need to filter by a UserId.  The SQL Server backend has a common column for all tables INT UserId.  With every query to the database we have to pass and evaluate a UserId param such as in LINQ, etc.  Is there a good way that we can remove this code so that all queries automatically pass a UserId set at some higher level  For example, if I want to GetFoo from the database for a UserId I can have the application call context.GetFoo and not have to pass the UserId as a param  Maybe when creating the context for example we could pass the UserId at that levelp

Negative 2595 pIm writing a very simple Nodejs app. I use React  Socket.io. p  pTheres a root element which immediately renders another react component you may wonder why I have this root element. The reason is that I want to be able to mount one of the two components after receiving a message from server, but for the start I render a preselected component.  In this root component , I define a socket in codecomponentDidMountcode . Now the problem is that I want to pass this socket to all of the children so they can listen and communicate with the server messages. But if I connect to the server in codecomponentDidMountcode of the root, during the rendering there is no socket as its not connected yet and codenullcode will be passed to the child components. p  precodeuse strict  var React  requirereact var ioClient  requiresocket.ioclient var UsersList  require.usersList var Game  require.game var socket  var Snake  React.createClass      displayName Snake,      propTypes ,      getDefaultProps function          return      ,      mixins [],      getInitialState function          return              usersList true,             game false              ,      componentWillMount function      ,      componentWillUnmount function          this.socket.close     ,     componentDidMount function          socket  ioClient.connect  this happens after render     ,     render function          var result  null         if this.state.usersList              result  ltUsersList socketsocketgt  therefore this one is passed as null          else  game  true             result  ltGame socketsocketgt                  return ltdivgt             result         ltdivgt        module.exports  Snake  use strict  var React  requirereact      var UsersList  React.createClass          displayName UsersList,          propTypes ,          getDefaultProps function              return          ,          mixins [],          getInitialState function              return                  usersList[]                      ,         componentWillReceiveProps function         ,         componentWillMount function          ,          componentWillUnmount function          ,          componentDidMount function              var socket  this.props.socket  this one was passed into the component as null             socket.onusersList, functiondata  so this one returns an error                 this.setState                     usersList data.usersList                                       ,         render function              var users  []             for var i  0  i lt this.state.usersList.length  i                 users.pushltspangtthis.state.usersList[i]ltspangt                          returnltdivgtusersltdivgt                    module.exports  UsersList codepre  pSo , now you may ask why I dont put codeio.connectcode in codecomponentWillMountcode or at the top of the file.

Each of the components are related to the same work project.p  pI have structured my source tree so that each of the components is independent  in other words each component smartclient, webservice, daemon, proxy, common utilities has its own trunk and its own solution file as I want to be able to release each component independently. For components that are used by other components, such as in the case of the smartclient using the proxy and the common utilities, I have created releases that are handled like any other 3rd party library binaries referenced instead of projects. Can anyone confirm that this is somewhat a bestpractice and if not how should this be done otherwisep  pI have been building releases of my components using tfs build and am wondering where I should put the releases if anywhere other than in the build output directory where all the tfs builds reside. Should I perhaps check them e.g. proxy release assemblies to be used by the smartclient into TFS along with any other 3rd party libraries and then branch the release assemblies where they are to be used e.g. branch proxy release dlls to the smartclient lib directoryp

But during runtime when I access FIELD1 in one application App2.warCommonClass.FIELD1 it has the value from another application App1.warCommonClass.FIELD1.

Hit must reach 100 to be a possible part of best score. This does so I cant check each individual slot first to try and find the best gear. Hit is a very important stat up to 100, but every point after 100 is useless. Also, this part of my code has a lot more of foreachloops 28 instead of 4. So number of iterations are a LOT.

Negative 2595 pWhen CSS float is used on a DIV, other DIVs that are not floated continue to occupy the space of the floated DIV.

While I am sure there is a way to obscure the parts of the red background I dont want, it would still leave the border cropped off and hidden underneath the DIV.  Ideally, I want the background color and border to only occupy valid text space, and not creep underneath the floated DIV.  Is this effect possiblep  pPlease note that I am using the float property not as a replacement for columns, but as a block that will have the text flow around it.  So far none of the proposed solutions takes this into account.  For clarity, here are some images.p  pThis is what I getp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh8Fod.png altBadp  pThis is what I wantp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZY6uF.png altGoodp  pYoull notice that in both examples, the final text wraps around the floated part as the text reaches the bottom.  My second example I can achieve by directly specifying the width of the div containing Some sample text.  I do not want to specify the width.  It seems redundant since I want the same width as that of the text around it.   But perhaps that isnt possiblep

However, that doesnt change my current predicament  I would like a working build without having to rewrite every single one of my Unit Tests in the nUnit Framework  Would converting a MS Unit Test project take any considerable amount of time  it looks the same to mep  pWhat is the best way for me to proceed now We are unable to install Visual Studio on the box and our IT department wont allow us access to go fiddling in the registry.p
Negative 2595 pI am using the task parallel library from .NET framework 4 specifically codeParallel.Forcode and codeParallel.ForEachcode however I am getting extremely mediocre speedups when parallelizing some tasks which look like they should be easily parallelized on a dualcore machine. p  pIn profiling the system, it looks like there is a lot of thread synchronization going on because of the garbage collector. I am doing a lot of allocation of objects, so I am wondering how I can improve the concurrency while minimizing a rewrite of my code. p  pFor example are there some techniques that can be useful in this situation p  ul liShould I try to manage the GC manuallyli liShould I be using codeDisposecode li liShould I be pinning objectsli liShould I be doing other unsafe code tricks    li ul  pPOSTSCRIPTp  pThe problem is not the GC running too often, it is that the GC prevents concurrent code from being running in parallel efficiently. I also dont consider allocate fewer objects to be an acceptable answer. That requires rewriting too much code to work around a poorly parallelized garbage collector. p  pI already found one trick which helped overall performance a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvisualizeparallelarchive20091228parallelperformancecasestudyfindingreferencestoparallelextensions.aspxusing gcServera but it didnt help the concurrent performance. In other words codeParallel.Forcode was only 20 faster than a serial For loop, on an embarrassingly parallel task. p  pPOSTPOSTSCRIPTp  pOkay, let me explain further, I have a rather big and complex program an optimizing interpreter. It is fast enough, but I want its performance when given parallel tasks primitive operations built into my language to scale well as more cores are available. I allocate lots of small object during evaluations. The whole interpreter design is based on all values being derived from a single polymorphic base object. This works great in a singlethreaded application, but when we try to apply the Task Parallel Library to parallel evaluations there is no advantage.p  pAfter a lot of investigation into why the Task Parallel Library was not properly distributing work across cores for these tasks, it seems the culprit is the GC. Apparently the GC seems to act as a bottleneck because it does some behind the scene thread synchronization that I dont understand.p  pWhat I need to know is what exactly is the GC doing that can cause heavily concurrent code to perform badly when it does lots of allocations, and how we can work around that bother thanb just iallocating fewer objectsi. That approach has already occurred to me, and would require a significant rewrite of a lot of code. p

Negative 2595 pOne of our frontend developers keeps requesting from us backend developers that the backend notifies all connected clients its a clientserver environment of changes to objects.

Negative 2595 pIs there a tool that can determine .jar dependencies given a directory of .jar files and a separate directory of java source code I need to generate Eclipse .classpath files based on an existing code base that doesnt have any dependencies defined.p  pTo be more specific, Ive been given a large codebase consisting of a dozen or so J2EEstyle projects and a single directory of jar files. My client uses a custom development and build framework that is just too arcane for me to use and get any real work done.

Negative 2595 pI am playing with a sample WPF application that is tiered in a ModelViewPresenter manner. The Model is a collection of Animals which is displayed in a view via binding to properties in a presenter class. The XAML has an items control that displays all the animals in a model. p  pThe model class has a boolean attribute called IsMammal. I want to introduce a filter in the XAML in the form of a radio button group that filters the collection of animals based on the IsMammal attribute. Selection of the radiobutton Mammals updates the items control with all the Animals that have the IsMammal value set to true and when the value is toggled to NonMammals, the display is updated with all animals that have that particular boolean set to false. The logic to do the filtering is extremely simple. What is troubling me is the placement of the logic. I dont want any logic embedded in the .xaml.cs. I want the toggling of the radiobutton to trigger a logic in the presenter that tapers my animal collection to be rebound to the display.p  pSome guidance here will be extremely appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2595 pIve been tracking down some memory leaks in a Javascript file Ive been working with, and Ive found one of the last reamining culprits.  When I get the responseXML from an XMLHttpRequest, I dont think the response ever gets deleted.  I dont know how to delete it, I tried removing the child nodes and then setting it to null Hoping garbage collection would work and I also tried using the delete key word.  Neither of these things seemed to help.  Below is some of the offending code I omitted some timeout stuff that removes the request itself, but that is not whats causing the memory leak.p  precodevar request  new XMLHttpRequest request.openGET, url, true request.onreadystatechange  onReadyStateChange1 request.send   function onReadyStateChange1      if 4  request.readyState              if request.status  200                      request.responseXML     It leaks even if I just do this.             me.ParseDatarequest.responseXML             me.disconnected  0          else                      me.disconnected  1                  request.onreadystatechange  noop    noop is an empty function         request  null         me  null       codepre  pAs you can see in the code, I dont even call ParseData, I just put coderequest.responseXMLcode and it still leaks.  If I comment that line out as well, though, the leak is gone.  Meaning the leak is not in the ParseData function or elsewhere, it is the responseXML.  I believe it has to do with the tree structure of responseXML, the DOM tree is probably not being cleaned properly.  If anyone could help me that would be great.p

Negative 2595 pCan somebody explain to me why classes are not first class objects in Java There are certain patterns that would work really well if it did and Im constantly writing factory classes with getters and setters and just adding unnecessary cruft to classes just so I can get around to passing instances to methods instead of actual classes to factor out generic bits of code. For examplep  precodepublic class AsyncBookSearch extends AsyncTaskltString,BookItem,Voidgt       public ListView list     public AmazonItemAdapterltBookItemgt adapter     public AsyncBookSearchListView l,AmazonItemAdapterltBookItemgt ad          list  l         adapter  ad           Override     protected Void doInBackgroundString... keywords           TODO Autogenerated method stub         new BookSearchkeywords[0],list,adapter.parse         return null       codepre  pI have several such classes and if I want to make the whole thing generic then the stuff in codedoInBackgroundcode will lead to several extra methods and other kinds of duplication in argument passing which wouldnt be a problem if I could write the followingp  precodepublic class AsyncItemSearchltT extends GenericItemSearchltSgt,S extends GenericItemgt extends AsyncTaskltString,T,Voidgt       public ListView list     public AmazonItemAdapterltSgt adapter     public AsyncBookSearchListView l,AmazonItemAdapterltSgt ad          list  l         adapter  ad           Override     protected Void doInBackgroundString... keywords           TODO Autogenerated method stub         new Tkeywords[0],list,adapter.parse         return null       codepre  pCurrently I cant write code like that in Java. I have to introduce unnecessary coupling into pretty much every class involved and this just makes things more convoluted because now not only does each instance need to worry about its own state but also about state in objects completely unrelated to its task.p

Negative 2595 pHey, a beginners question here.... In order to learn PHP and SQl I have set up a Localhost Server on my computer running Apache and phpmyadmin, using MAMP.p  pIn the course of testing, I have found that through the backend phpmyadmin interface I can modify the db as I please without any trouble. However, when I try to query the db through php scripts, no changes seem to be committed.p  pI say this because it seems that I am able to open a connection to phpmyadmin, evident by the error messages I receive when trying to pass a malformed query.p  pWhen I run these scripts, and then check the backend, I see no changes even though I received no errors. p  pMy best guess would be php is incorrect.

Negative 2595 pI have been using Subversion at my current position for just over one year.  It was one of the first things I did here.  I immediately implemented it as there was no versioning control of any kind in place.p  pLast year, I imported our entire site into Subversion.  I imported it exactly as it was, garbage and all.  PDFs, images, frontpage vticnf folders, EVERYTHING.p  pI felt this would allow me to safely make any changes to the site, and give me a starting point to be able to track changes progress, etc...p  pNow a year later, Im a little upset with some of the way I set this up.  Mainly I want to figure out a better way to handle binary documents.  strongI do not want to put binary files in my repository. period.strongp  h2Please noteh2  pImages, are different. TortoiseSVN can compare images, and they are a different animal. They would affect the look or feel of the site. This is not the case for pdfs, word docs, excel, access dbs, zip files, movies, etc... p  hr  pHere is the process for how we manage website updates to production.  Updates to the site are done weekly, after the site is updated I create a tagged copy for that week.p  ol liI get a request to update a pdf with a new version, and change the hyperlink text to have some new description  li liI update my working copy to the latest version, I make the html code change to the site.  li liI copy the new version of the pdf file into my working copy, replacing the old pdf with the new.  li liAt this point, my working copy shows 2 pending changes, though only one is actually a code change.  PDFs are just content.  li liI codecommitcode both changes to my repo.  li liNow when its time to move to production, I compare my trunk with last weeks tag folder.  li liTortoiseSVN is able to generate an export of only the files that need to be updated on production, with full paths.  I do this so I can alway have the root copied over to the production site.li liI export the files and empty folder structures to a location where another team picks it up and copies it over to production.  li ol  pSo using this method, both the code change and the PDF get moved to production.  But, I dont like it.p  pMy other problem, with not using the above process is that I also dont trust my memory to remember during every move to production to manually copy the pdfs into my changeset prior to moving to production.p

First is Object Selection using the Back Buffer Red book, chapter 14 setting the colour of each object to its object id and reading the colour of pixels from the back frame buffer. The second is occlusion queries superbible, 4th ed, chap 13.p  pOther approaches I have ruled out are looking at the minmax z values in the selection buffer and doing custom rayobject detection outside of GL.p  pI have some questions 1 If GLSELECT is deprecated in recent OpenGL, what alternatives are developers supposed to be using 2 Ive only ever read about occlusion queries being employed to speed up rendering. Can they be used for selectionpicking, and are there drawbacks 3 The existing application has a handful of glColorXXX calls. If I went the back buffer route, and used glColorMaskFALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE, will this effectively turn the glColourXXX calls into calls that have no effect, thereby letting me control the colour in a single place when rendering in select mode 4 Which route is bestcanonicalp

Negative 2595 pIm creating a live data monitor GUI with PyQt4 and matplotlib to create the plots.  The GUI displays multiple plots at a time around 6 or 7.  To give the GUI thread more time and slightly better response time I only do the drawing codecanvas.drawcode and all other plotting commands I do in the thread that updates the plot data.  So in the nonGUI thread I do commands like codeline.setydatacode, codeax.setylimcode, and other things that might need to be updated.p  pThe two threads have access to the figure and canvas objects through a dictionary that is passed to the two threads at initialization.  When the nonGUI thread gets data and updates the plot, it then signals the GUI thread to redraw the canvas using Qts signals autoconnection.  My threading experience tells me that I should use a lock or make sure the nonGUI thread is blocked on the redraw in some way, but in my coding rush I never put it in and forgot about it until now.  The key point to this situation is that I want to see every update of the plot, not redraw in the middle of the other thread updating or even miss an update if that makes sense.  Currently, I think Im just getting lucky with timing and things seem to be working ok.p  pAnother thing that might be helpful to know is that Im creating threads by moving a QObject to a QThread by using moveToThread.p  pMy questions arep  ul liAm I just getting lucky or is Qt just doing something magicalli liWhat is the best way to accomplish the blocking on the matplotlib canvasfigureli ul  pI should probably note that this was my first attempt at making the GUI more responsive moving matplotlib commands into the data thread and I may be moving to a blit animation style drawing of only updating the parts of the plot that change.  But Im still curious as to how lucky I am.p  pThanks for any help.p  pstrongUpdateClarificationContinuation from commentsstrong I wanted the entire monitor system to be easily changedupdated by scientists who may only be familiar with matlab and maybe matplotlib.  Im not completely against changing to pyqwt for plotting for speed.  And in terms of frames per second, I dont really need a lot at all since the data that is being plotted only comes in every 0.5 seconds nominal 0.2 seconds at the fastest.  The GUI responsiveness just seems to eat emem because there are so many plots.  Ive done a proof of concept hacking of my code with matplotlib blitting and it seems to help a ton, pyqwt will happen if needed.  My previous questions still stand.p

Negative 2595 pI have a number of dialogs in a application where a custom view is used. Prior to Android 4 the height and width of these dialogs are adapting as I would expect according to the content. In an Andorid 4 emulator this behavior has changed. It looks like the width will stretch to accomodate content but it has a minimum size below which it will not go. I can make a dialog wider but for narrow content the dialog box will not reduce as I would expect. My content is therefore showing in the left side of an overwide dialog box. All works perfectly on 3.0. I have tried p  precodedialog.setContentViewR.layout.helpdialog dialog.getWindow.setLayoutLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT codepre  pThis has no effect. Also the content of the title is not forcing the dialog to extend. Any thoughts greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2595 pI have searched all over for an answer, or even a reference to this particular issue to no avail.  I am using JQuery UI 1.8.7 and JQuery 1.5.1.  I have a dialog that I want to not only destroy on close, but also remove from the DOM on close.  This works fine in Firefox.  However, when I do the same thing in IE7, I see a 6MB spike in memory usage for the browser, and this memory never gets reclaimed until I shut down the browser completely.  So my first thought was, something in my dialog is causing memory leaks.  I stripped out everything that I was adding, and made a simple dialog using the following codep  precodeltdiv idtestMegthelloltdivgt.dialog     modal true,     autoOpen true,     close function  this.dialogdestroy   codepre  pWhen I open this dialog, close it, and then refresh the browser.  I always end up with 6MB more memory than I had before.  If I open this dialog, but then refresh the browser before closing it, then I do not see any memory spike at all.  I have no idea what could be causing this  I have found a bunch of threads about general JQuery UI memory leaks, but none of the fixes have done anything to remedy my situation.  p  pI also thought that maybe some other code in my project was getting in the way.  This is not the case  If I do the same thing using this jsFiddle example, I get a memory spike as well a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netn68Af1httpjsfiddle.netn68Af1a.  At this point, I have no idea where else to turn or what else to do.  I need to destroy these dialogs and remove them from the DOM  there are already quite a few instances of the dialogs throughout our very large application that bank on the fact that the dialog Div is no longer in the DOM after closing.  p  pEdit Changing the value of the modal flag has no effect.  Also, I realize that my example does not remove the element from the DOM.  Whether I do that or not, the memory leak remains.  The code in my actual project is just removing the element from the dom using this.remove.  I simplified the example, because the real issue is the destroy call leaving some sort of circular reference or something that is causing the 6MB memory spike I mentioned.p  pEdit  After looking into this more, it doesnt seem to matter what JQuery UI widget I am using I tried Dialog, my own custom widget, and Button.  As long as I remove the element that the widget is referencing from the DOM, I see the huge memory leak in IE7.  The memory leak also happens if I move the elements to somewhere else in the DOM.  I tried creating a garbage bin DIV that I moved all the contents of my dialog to instead of removing them completely, and the same spike happened.p  pAny help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2595 pI have this application Windows form application written in Visual C from a colleague of mine and I face some serious problems. The application is neither a service neither a normal application, I mean it has a GUI but most of the time it runs in background it should react as a service but its not. This application is preventing the user to log off, and I need to be able to do that.p  pI know that Windows sends the codeWMQUERYENDSESSIONcode message to all running applications when the user tries to log off. I have tried to catch this message on my codeWndProccode function and to kill the application by force but it only works once. When I login again and try to log off the operation is not terminated because my application wont close.p  pIf I try to use codeSessionEndingcode event, the application is only put to the system tray and remains there without logging off but this I believe its because the codeFormClosingcode method performs this operation instead of closing the program this was the requirement and I cant change that.p  pMaybe another useful information is that the application starts automatically because it has an entry in the codeHKLMcode registry and there are always 2 instances of this application running one should supervise the other one and restart it in case of crash but not in case of manually shut down.p  pAny suggestions will be well received.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2595 pLong ago I have learned sql and within the last years of application development I realized I only rarely really play with a real sql console or sql commands at all, especially since I mainly work with rails applications for a while now.p  pBut right now I am working on getting a few Microsoft certifications, so for that I did end up relearning sql from scratch. And by that so many things come to mind that  I have to admit  I have forgotten over all the years.

Is it possible to add them via the selectmethod of ActiveRecordp  pStored Procedures How would one use those from Rails, i mean they could be valuable if you have several complex queries with multiple joins and calculationbased dependencies. I wonder a how to call one and b how to receive the resultsp  pWell, if you have more insight to the inner workings of Rails in relation to sql and could point out if these native sqlelements are available forfrom a Railsapplication it would be lovely if you could point at some Howtos, Tutorials.p  pAnother thing I am wondering about is the use of foreign keys. Rails doesnt use them explicitly on the sqlside... would it be usefulhelpful to manually add them to the database relations Or would they hinder Rails data accessp  pThanks for any response, I am eager to find out what I can do between Rails and Sql to combine them in a maybe more efficient way.p

And if it is 0, the points are on the same imaginary line extending from P1.p  pI am sure that they are using some Vector Mathematics to find the direction.p  pCan someone please help me how to arrive to this solutionp

Negative 2595 pUsing ASP.NET MVC when I create my model, then a controller based on the model with CRUD operations, the CRUD views are generated. I added some code using Fluent API to require certain fields but for some reason the ModelState.IsValid passes even when these fields are not completed. What determines whether this passes or not I thought it was based on your model property data types and other things like being required or maxlength, etc.... p  pAlso, I have manually added code to grab a list of Categories from the database and generate a checkbox for each one in the View. This is a navigation property for the Project model where there is a manymany relationship. To get the group of checked values in the CreateProject project method in the controller I usep  precodevar selected  Request[categories].Split, codepre  pThis however, throws the classic Object reference not set to an instance of an object error if no values are checked.

Negative 2595 pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.reddit.comrprogrammingcommentspfe6yusinguninitializedmemoryforfunandprofitthis reddit comment threada, it is undefined if an attempt is made to read memory before it has been written to. Im referring to normal heap memory which has been succesfully codemalloccodeed.p  blockquote   p... note that this is not strictly valid C the compilerruntime system is allowed to initialize uninitialized memory with socalled trap representations, which cause undefined behavior on access.p blockquote  pI find this hard to believe. Is there a Standard quotep  pOf course, I understand that there is no guarantee that the memory has been zeroed out. The values in this uninitialized memory are essentially pseudorandom or arbitrary. But I cant really believe that the Standard would refer to this as emundefined behaviourem in the sense that it might segfault, or delete all your files, or whatever.

Negative 2595 pWe have an old and big Java EE project, where at some places due to bad coding database connections has not been closed properlyor not cleaned up in catchfinally block. p  pWe have limited our database connection pool to 100 connections. Sometimes it happens that the connection remains open and all the 100 connections are used, so the application gets hanged up. Im trying to restructure this project, obviously Ill take care of this bad code when I get there, Im wondering is there any lightweight Java EE framework which closes this opened db connection automatically without writing conn.close or session.close. p  pMaybe something like Django where every db connection are closed at the end of every requestreposnse cycle.p  pI do know that I can use tools like p6spy and IronTrack SQL to look for statements that fail to close, but Im more interested in frameworks as this project doesnt use any and Im trying to integrate this project with a framework.p

And it also works when I swap the codescode in the regex with a codedcode or codencode.p  pI know your asking why reinvent the wheel, just use codeString.formatcode, and I should its just that Ive got this on my mind and cant do anything else until I solve it.p  pI also tried copying and pasting the codejava.util.Formattercode classbr coded[ 0,lt]d.d[tT][azAZ]code regex but it did the same as above and only worked for codescode or code9scode.p  pI also noticed in the Formatter class that the developers used an instance of the Matcher class with an instance of the Patern class and used a for loop to run through a String and match each instance of the pattern and stored it into an ArrayList. I dont really want to do that, I just want to see if the String argument has one instance of codencode or codescode or codedcode and from that store it in a String that will be used later in cobination with codeString.formatformat, argumentcode.p  pSo if anyone could help me that would be awesomebr Thank you for reading this far.p

Negative 2595 pI am having trouble getting my LinearLayout to display views in the desired proportion. I have perused some 10 or 15 other questions about LinearLayout and layoutweight, but for some reason no answers seem to apply in my case. I am creating a custom AlertDialog colorpicker with a custom View created as followsp  precodeprivate LinearLayout createLayout      Create our toplevel layout     LinearLayout mainLayout  new LinearLayoutmContext     mainLayout.setOrientationLinearLayout.VERTICAL     mainLayout.setPadding15, 0, 15, 0     Make the preset view at the top     LinearLayout.LayoutParams presetViewParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, 0, 0.2f     mainLayout.addViewnew PresetViewmContext, presetViewParams         Create another linear layout         LinearLayout subLayout  new LinearLayoutmContext         subLayout.setOrientationLinearLayout.HORIZONTAL         subLayout.setPadding0, 15, 0, 15         Add the Sat Lum View to the second layout         LinearLayout.LayoutParams satLumViewParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParams0, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, 0.60f         subLayout.addViewnew SatLumViewmContext, satLumViewParams         Add the divider between the sat lum view and the hue view         LinearLayout.LayoutParams dividerViewParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParams0, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, 0.1f         subLayout.addViewnew DividerViewmContext, dividerViewParams         Add the Hue View to the second layout         LinearLayout.LayoutParams hueViewParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParams0, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, 0.30f         subLayout.addViewnew HueViewmContext, hueViewParams         Add the second layout to the first layout         LinearLayout.LayoutParams subLayoutParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, 0, 0.7f         mainLayout.addViewsubLayout, subLayoutParams     Add the Line view at the bottom of the main layout     LinearLayout.LayoutParams lineParams  new LinearLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, 0, 0.1f     mainLayout.addViewnew LineViewmContext, lineParams     Return our completed layout     return mainLayout  codepre  pThe problem Im having is that despite having set the layoutheight of my three vertical elements PresetView, subLayout, and LineView to 0, the weight is still not distributing the available space how I want. subLayout does not get 70 of the space, but always less. From what I can tell, the PresetView is always getting as much vertical space as it asks for, and subLayout and LineView are left to take up the remaining. Here is my onMeasure method for PresetViewp  precode    protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec          int width  resolveSize250, widthMeasureSpec         int height  resolveSize150, heightMeasureSpec         setMeasuredDimensionwidth, height      codepre  pThe 250 and 150 are rather arbitrary values  the PresetView is designed to work with just about any set of dimensions because I want the LinearLayout to control its size. I was under the impression that using a layoutheight of 0 and specifying a weight put the layout in control of the space taken up by the View, rather than the View controlling it. Why is the PresetView still taking up a full 150 pixels, when I set its layoutheight to 0p  pThe onMeasure method of the other Views is identical to PresetViews, only with different values.p

Negative 2595 pIm trying to implement a UDPbased server that maintains two sockets, one for controllingcodectrlsockcode and the other for data transmissioncodedatasockcode. The thing is, codectrlsockcode is always uplink and codedatasockcode is downlink. That is, clients will request data transmissionstop via the codectrlsockcode and data will be sent to them via codedatasockcode.p  pNow the problem is, since the model is connectionless, the server will have to maintain a list of registered clients information I call it codepeerscontextcode such that it can blindly push data to them until they ask to stop. During this blind transmission, clients may send controlling messages to the server via the codectrlsockcode asynchronously. These information, besides initial Request and Stop, can also be, for example, preferences of file parts. Therefore, the codepeerscontextcode has to be updated asynchronously. However, the transmission over the codedatasockcode relies on this codepeerscontextcode structure, hence raises a synchronization problem between codectrlsockcode and codedatasockcode. My question is, what can I do to safely maintain these two socks and the codepeerscontextcode structure such that the asynchronous update of codepeerscontextcode wont cause a havoc. By the way, the update of codepeerscontextcode wouldnt be very frequent, that is why I need to avoid the requestreply model.p  pMy initial consideration of the implementation is, to maintain ctrlsock in the main threadlistener thread, and transmission over codedatasockcode is maintained in the other threadworker thread. However, I found it is difficult to synchronize in this case. For example, if I use mutexes in codepeerscontextcode, whenever the worker thread locks codepeerscontextcode, the listener thread wouldnt have access to it anymore when it needs to modify codepeerscontextcode, because the worker thread works endlessly. On the other hand, if the listener thread holds the codepeerscontextcode and writes to it, the worker thread would fail to read codepeerscontextcode and terminates. Can anybody give me some suggestionsp  pBy the way, the implementation is done in Linux environment in C. Only the listener thread would need to modify codepeerscontextcode occasionally, the worker thread only needs to read. Thanks sincerelyp

I need the UI control to mirror the look and feel or the existing components. Heres what Ive tried and the problems Ive encounteredp  ul liUsing a codeTextBoxcode with a drawn codeComboBoxcode button Ive tried using codeComboBoxRenderer.DrawDropDownButtoncode but the look and feel does not mirror the existing UI controls. In particular we dont have codeApplication.EnableVisualStylescode so the buttons have a Windows 98 look and feel. codeComboBoxRenderercode draws a glossy grey button.li liUsing a codeComboBoxcode and a codeToolStripDropDowncode to contain the calender control the button has the correct look and feel but I cannot hide the drop down box completely. Even though the codeToolStripControlHostcode is effectively hiding the drop down box, when I click the button, I can see the drop down box being rendered just before the codeToolStripDropDowncode is displayed. Ive tried workarounds that effectively disable the drop down box but the button, as you would expect, does not maintain the desired visual state of being pressed and drawing the button brings me back to the problem in the above point. Setting the height of the drop down box to zero in codeOnMeasureItemcode does not work though I suppose I could make the drop down box the same height as my calendar UI selector so that the rendering doesnt look particularly bad.li ul  pAre there existing mechanisms to get the behaviour I need a codeTextBoxcode that displays the selected date with a drop down arrow button that, when clicked, displays a calendar UI selection component. The calendar component already exists and the button must look like the existing Windows 98 look and feel codeComboBoxcode buttons.p  pThank you for your time and assistance.p

Negative 2595 pIve created a game that targets the 800 x 480 resolution, but have become interested in having it adapt to other WP7 resolutions. Also, Ive heard that games can be ported to iPhone and Android through Mono and ExEn, opening up a ton of other screen resolutions.p  pWhat is the proper way to deal with this Id like to make the game smart enough to detect the screen size and alter the assets to look as close to the original as possible and play the same.p  pThis is a 2D game and I would think the ideal would be to have separate images for all resolutions, but to be futureproof this wouldnt work. Ive thought of having a baseline of 800 x 480, detecting size at start, and altering the Bounds of all my entities to scale, then simply draw the textures to those targets. This would allow me to do my collision detection correctly as well as scale the textures, but there is likely a better way.p  pAnyway, I hope I have explained the issue clearly. If not, I will edit the question after comments come in.p  pI appreciate your input.p

Negative 2595 pFirst time asking a question on the stack exchange, hopefully this is the right place.p  pI cant seem to develop a close enough approximation algorithm for my situation as Im not exactly the best in terms of 3D math.p  pI have a 3d environment in which I can access the position and rotation of any object, including my camera, as well as run trace lines from any two points to get distances between a point and a point of collision. I also have my cameras field of view. I do not have any form of access to the worldviewprojection matrices however.p  pI also have a collection of 2d images that are basically a set of screenshots of the 3d environment from the camera, each collection is from the same point and angle and the average set is taken at about an average of a 60 degree angle down from the horizon.p  pI have been able to get to the point of using registration point entities that can be placed in the 3d world that represent the corners of the 2d image, and then when a point is picked on the 2d image it is read as a coordinate with range 01, which is then interpolated between the 3d positions of the registration points. This seems to work well, but only if the image is a perfect top down angle. When the camera is tilted and another dimension of perspective is introduced, the results become more grossly inaccurate as there no compensation for this perspective.p  pI dont need to be able to calculate the height of a point, say a window on a sky scraper, but at least the coordinate at the base of the image plane, or which if I extend a line out from my image from a specified image space point I need at least the point that the line will intersect with the ground if there was nothing in the way.p  pAll of the material I found about this says to just deproject the point using the worldviewprojection matrices, which I find straightforward in itself except I dont have access to these matrices, just data I can collect at screenshot time and other algorithms use complex maths I simply dont grasp yet.p  pOne end goal of this would be able to place markers in the 3d environment where a user clicks in the image, while not being able to run a simple deprojection from the users view.p  pAny help would be appreciated, thanks.p  pstrongEditstrong Herp derp, while my implementation for doing so is a bit odd due to the limitations of my situation, the solution essentially boiled down to ananthonlines answer about simply recalculating the viewprojection matrices. p

Negative 2595 pI am working on a asp.net project the client has given me access to a database remotely. p  pThe database has two users.

Negative 2595 pIm trying to make a fullyautomated game engine which needs to be working based on the events. The problem Im facing is that Ive made a map class and its initialized in the game class. Its almost static and only one map exists for a game. New maps are loaded by clearing the objects in the current map and adding new maps. You can see the source of the map class here.p  pa hrefhttpcode.google.compgameengineforjavasourcebrowsesrccomgejmapMap.java relnofollowhttpcode.google.compgameengineforjavasourcebrowsesrccomgejmapMap.javaap  pThe main problems comes in the collision detection, where Im using the bruteforce collision detection where I should not. This slows down the game a lot and I wanna check the collisions only for objects which are nearer to the object. Ive been using the MapLoader interface to construct the maps. Im thinking that calling the collision method of the objects in another thread might help. However it all the map objects are updated in the Game class.p  pHeres the game class if in case it might helpp  pa hrefhttpcode.google.compgameengineforjavasourcebrowsesrccomgejcoreGame.java relnofollowhttpcode.google.compgameengineforjavasourcebrowsesrccomgejcoreGame.javaap  pTheres another problem that sometimes, the objects arent destroyed. Im calling the maps removeObject method but it takes a 1second delay and some times wont remove atall.p  pIt gives me 4864 fps in a platform game with 158 objects in the game. But in a spaceinvaders style game, it gives me only 2030 fps. Any advice on optimization is greatly appreciated...p  pIf anybody could get me a tutorial for binary spacing etc., I would be thankful.p

Negative 2595 pI am currently investigating possible solutions for flexible load balancing of a streaming application. I will have several nodes running the application that will process and stream content to the users. Documents are spread among any number of servers such that a single machine is responsible for serving requests to the set of documents it hosts. p  pThus, I need some kind of broker that knows on which server the requested document resides and that does a forward to that server. I do NOT want to use some codeHttpConnectioncode from the broker and then include the response of that http call into the response of the original request this will obviously be a bottleneck. p  pSo my question is How can I forward a request to another server after having analyzed the requests data codePOSTcodecodeGETcode params, headers or whatever and determined the destination server p  pIs there already a good load balancer out there that allows me to use some form of hooks to provide the logic of how to determine destination servers round robin will obviously not work p  pI want to use Tomcat or something similar to host the streaming application and use only the fundamental servlet stack. Any hints to tools or patterns are appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2595 pIt is pretty easy to split a rectanglesquare into smaller regions and enforce a maximum area of each subregion.  You can just divide the region into regions with sides length sqrtmaxarea and treat the leftovers with some care.p  pWith a quadrilateral however I am stumped.  Lets assume I dont know the angle of any of the corners.  Lets also assume that all four points are on the same plane.  Also, I dont need for the the small regions to be all the same size.  The only requirement I have is that the area of each individual region is less than the max area.p  pIs there a particular data structure I could use to make this easierbr Is there an algorithm Im just not findingp  pCould I use quadtrees to do this  Im not incredibly versed in trees but I do know how to implement the structure.p  pI have GIS work in mind when Im doing this, but I am fairly confident that that will have no impact on the algorithm to split the quad.  p

Negative 2595 pI am currently working on speech recognition. I have to compare the signature of an unknow sound in term of frequencies with other signatures of sounds that we know.br Concretely, we determine the peaks formants in the spectrum of a sound, that are specific that caracterise to this sound. We memorize the frequencies of this peaks as tuples. We memorize the tuples of known sounds. There are thousands if not hundred of thousands of them.br For each new sound to identify, we compare the tuples of that sound to the tuples of the known sounds. That requires to make a lot of comparisons p  pI need to find a way to compare these tuples quickly.p  pI already looked up and I found that it is a strongNearest neighbor searchstrong problem. strongHowever I dont think that I can use theses algorithms.strongp  pIndeed, the tuples can have a different number of components. The components are just frequencies in kHz. It can be 1  2 or 1  2.4  4  5  6  7  7.1  11  12.1 13 up to 20 components.p  pstrongSo my question is strong I dont have a dataset with tuples of the same dimension, how can I find the nearest neighboor p  pIt is my understanding that in order to apply Nearest neighboor algorithms one has to have emtuples of the same dimensionem. p  pThanks for reading me.br Have a nice dayp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I dont just need to find strongthestrong closest neighboors, I actually need to find strongallstrong the neighbooring points that are distant by less than a distance D to my reference point.p  pstrongEDIT2strongbr randomhacker No they dont. You can compare an element of the tuple with an element of another tuple, only if the difference between these two elements is lt threshold. p  pstrongEDIT3strongbr Youre absolutly right mathias, I just typed something random. In fact the elements of a tuple are frequencies sorted ascending and indeed each frequency of a tuple only appears once. So 4  2 is wrong, it should be 2  4 and 2  2  4 doesnt exist, its 24 no repeatp

Negative 2595 pI seem to have found that post multiplying a vector with a matrix in a a vertex shader works on my desktop machine but not on my Android phone.p  pIm using libGDX and GLES2.0 to write a game. I got a decent chunk of it working on desktop, but when I tried to run it on Android it just showed blank clearcolor. By messing around I discovered the problem was only there when I was using a matrix in my vertex shader. The vertex shader in question isp  precodeattribute vec3 aVertPos attribute vec2 aTexCoord  uniform mat4 uCamMatrix uniform vec3 uPosition uniform vec2 uSize  varying vec2 vTexCoord  void main    vTexCoord  aTexCoord    vec3 scale  vec3uSize,0.0   vec4 dest  vec4aVertPosscaleuPosition,1.0  uCamMatrix   glPosition  dest  codepre  pI found I still got the blank screen even if I passed uCamMatrix as an identity matrix. Utterly puzzled, I looked around at other shaders and  without expecting a result  switched the order of the matrix and vector in that linep  precodevec4 dest  uCamMatrix  vec4aVertPosscaleuPosition,1.0 codepre  pI had been transposing the matrix before passing it, so I stopped doing that since I was changing the order. This totally fixed the issue.p  pThe desktop version looks the same as it always did, so the calculation result must be the way it was before.p  pSo does AndroidGLES20 have some quirk about matrix multiplication Is this a bug Am I just missing something obviousp

We construct this trie so that at the           end of an successful match, the keywordID K2 can be retrieved.     3.4 Return the correct set of keywordID K2 for this line V1 4 Profit  codepre  pstrongMy questionsstrong  p  ul liIs this a good approach Efficiency is very important  are there any better ways Anything to improveli liAre there any libraries I could use Preferably something that would work well with Java.li ul  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2595 pI have a database with a lot of UDFs that contains a long running process involving lots of data manipulation and calculations.  p  pMy thinking in using UDFs is to separate out logical units of information from the tables underlying.  For example, if i am trying to get information about a car i might have several tables like Color, Model, Year, etc that i would have to join each time to get a Car.  Instead, I would have a function like fnCar to get a denormalized view of the data.p  pI call these functions a lot during my long running process and Im wondering if it would be better if instead I had a denormalized working table,view, or temp table to do my data manipulation and calculations.  Is there some disadvantage to using UDFs in general that I should be aware of in terms of performance  p  pFor example, I make some calculations using a UDF.  I then unpivot that data and store in a table.  Whenever i need to use that data again, I call a UDF to pivot the data back out.  The reason we do it this way is to keep our calculations flexible.  We dont want to change the data model if we addremovechange the calculations.  p  precodeCalculate some values in a function  declare location table      id int,     lattitude float,     longitude float   insert into location select  1, 40.7, 74 insert into location select  2, 42, 73 insert into location select  3, 61, 149 insert into location select  4, 41, 87   declare myLattitude float declare myLongitude float set myLattitude 43 set myLongitude  116  declare distance table      id int,     distance float   insert into distance select id, sqrtpowerlattitudemylattitude,2powerlongitudemylongitude,2 from location    Store unpivoted data in a table declare unpivot table      id int,     attribute varchar100,     attributeValue float   insert into unpivot      id,     attribute,     attributeValue  select id     ,attribute     ,attributevalue  from      select          L.id,         L.Lattitude,          L.Longitude,         D.Distance     from location L          inner join distance D          on L.idD.id  a unpivot       attributeValue for attribute in     lattitude, longitude, distance  x  retrive data from store via pivoting function for reporting  select   from unpivot pivot       maxattributeValue for Attribute in lattitude, longitude, distance   x codepre

Negative 2595 pRight now Im reading the book Linux Kernel Development 3d Edition by Robert Love. There he write about the threadinfo struct which contains the pointer to taskstruct struct and, as I understood, located at the bottom or at the top of kernel stack of process depends on architecture. I wasnt familiar with Linux kernel API until recently and I wasnt known of  current method existence. There is an excerpt from the book related to how current method actually works p  blockquote   pOn x86, current is calculated by masking out the 13 leastsignificant bits of the stack   pointer to obtain the threadinfo structure.This is done by the   currentthreadinfo function.The assembly is shown here   movl 8192, eax   andl esp, eax   This assumes that the stack size is 8KB.When 4KB stacks are enabled, 4096 is used in   lieu of 8192.p blockquote  pMy questions arep  ol liAs far as I know if we have a decimal value represented as a set of bits, then there is only one leastsignificant bit in the set, isnt itli liWhat is the magical number 13li ol  pFor thous who will read this topic, the questions I have voiced can lead to conclusion that the author dont understand properly the process of memory allocation and administration. Ok, thats may be right due to the fact that in my mind I can represent the memory allocated for the stack as the ribbon full of bits or bytes. All of this bytes accessible by a specific memory address represented as some decimal value. The origin of the stack is the lowest memory address and the fin of the stack is the highest value of memory address. But HOW, HOW can we get the the pointer to the threadinfo struct located at the, say, end of the stack only by masking out 13 leastsignificant bits of ARBITRARY located stack pointer If I understood correctly, we masking out bits of the stack pointer ADDRESS represented as decimal value.p

Negative 2595 pIn Smalltalk, the system browser is the central tool for pretty much anything. Glamour seems to be a package for building general purpose browsers using a declarative scripting language. From the a hrefhttpscg.unibe.charchivemastersBung09a.pdfpapera it is available in VisualWorks and Pharo, but Im talking here only for the Pharo version. p  pBesides the technical advantages of Glamour over older approaches, the support for OmniBrowser seems to be stopped by 20112012. So Glamour, which has been around from 2009, could possibly be the logical successor of OmniBrowser. But there is an amazing surprise Another browser project was created, it is called a hrefhttprmod.lille.inria.frwebpiersTHDxoUBefXQB5rn8Nautilusa. p  pPossibly because developers noticed that being a browser implementation framework and a class browser is difficult to maintain, OmniBrowser was splitted in Glamour for browser framework and Nautilus for Smalltalk Class Browsing. emQuoting from the Nautilus chpater It was designed to browse RPackage, to be compatible with the RB refactoring engine, to be environment aware and to work with Announcementsemp  ul liIs that impression rightli liIs Glamour still actively developedli liDoes Glamour and Nautilus have overlapping purposesli ul

The user can draw on multiple layers. One layer is active at a time and its drawn frontmost. He can also flip the layers, as if looking from the other side. I figured it would be inefficient to update all vertices when the layer order changes, so I give each vertex a layer number and lookup its current position in the uniform I only send x and y as position data. Also, as a side note the fragment shader uses the same layer number to determine the color, using a uniform array as well.p

However, my new project leads to an interesting situation I need to login to a site through a codeWebViewcode and emthenem pull the HTML.  Obviously, the codeSocketcode method doesnt work, because in order for a webpage to be returned you need the cookie for authentication.  Ive also tried the codeJavascriptInterfacecode trick, but that didnt work either.  Im thinking the best way to achieve this is to use codeHttpGetcode with codeCookieManagercode  Does anyone know how I can get raw HTML code from a codeWebViewcode with an auth cookie  Thanksp  pEDIT I did some JS injection and didnt see any cookies... so it might not be a cookie issue  But the links that you get redirected to are generic, like codemainPagea1code and codeinfoPagecode.  You cannot simply copypaste the links into another browser you emhaveem to be logged in to view these links.  For those of you who are web experts, you may know an easy solution.p

Negative 2595 pI have a lots of data to be displayed on one codeActivitycode. So, I just used codeScrollViewcode. But the thing is I have even 56 images to be displayed on the same activity. p  pSo, I used codeGalleryViewcode inside codeScrollViewcode and it exactly suits my requirement. Because in gallery, 56 images are kept and it acts as a preview container and whenever user clicks on gallery item, I show the respective image on the codeImageViewcode which acts as an enlarged image. This works fine on some devices, but when I tested on ICS devices, the codeScrollViewcode is not visible at all and it doesnt work.

Negative 2595 pI have a MySQL table with the following schema that records user activityp  precodeTABLE Activity id      INT AUTOINCREMENT   the primary key ts      TIMESTAMP           similar to DATETIME user    INT                 a unique ID for each user action  INT                 action code  codepre  pEach time a user does an action, a row is added to this table. What I want to do now is generate a report summarizing total user activity per day. It would, for instance, look something like thisp  precodeDate        User 1  User 2  User 3  20130305      12      34      56 20130306      78      87      65 20130307      43      21      12 codepre  pIn this example, user 1 did 78 actions on March 6, and 43 actions on March 7, and user 3 did 56 actions on March 5. At this point I dont care what kind of actions were done on a particular day, just the total number of all actions that were done by a particular user.p  pNow writing a MySQL query to summarize entries in the activity table into days for a single user is relatively straightforward, and I could run such a query for each user in turn though the days columns in each result set might not align perfectly. Is there a way to do this for all users automatically in one queryp  pI think this might be a little weird because the number of columns in the result could vary depending on how many users were active in the date range of interest. In other words, the number of columns in the report might be less than the number of users in the database.p  pEssentially, rather than having MySQL generate a onedimensional array of records as its output, I want it to generate a twodimensional array of values, where the labels for the rows and columns are derived from the activity table. Is this even possiblep  pI suppose I could always just go through the raw data in the table and build up a proper two dimensional array myself Ill be working in PHP, but I was wondering if MySQL could do that for me.p

Negative 2595 pI have tree of javascript objects. Lets call it family. It can contain any number of certain objects parents which can each contain any number of child objects. The number of levels in this structure is known and each level of the tree only contains objects of one certain type.p  pAll the objects have data and methods.p  pI want to save the structured data in the databese. JSON.stringify does it perfect extracting the data and also saving the structure. But how to get back to objects JSON.parse fails, because it recreates the object without methods.p  pWhat should I do in this case Should I write my own function for recreating the object from string Or should I save the data together with methods somehow seems a waste.p  pAs I know the structure, it would be very handy if there would be a possibility to point to an object and tell thats a parent object and it would get the methods. I could easily cycle through it then. But I dont know how to that and Im also afraid that my constructors could set some values to the default ones.p  pThe objects constructors would look something like thisp  precodefunction lines      this.lines  []     this.height  0.5theMargin      this.addLine  addLine      function addLinenewline              this.lines.pushnewline         this.height  newline.height        function aLine      this.dots  []     this.height  0     this.length  indent      this.insertDot  insertDot      function insertDotpos,newDot              this.dots.splicepos,0,newDot         this.length  newDot.length         this.height  Math.maxthis.height,newDot.height         if this.length gt maxLineLength          I will not go into details here        codepre  pThen I would do likep  precodevar a  new lines var testline  new aLine var testdot  new aDot  testdot.height  10 testdot.length  15 testline.insertDot0,testdot a.addLinetestline a.addLinetestline codepre  pThen I want to save the data about lengths and heights. And the structure, to know which dot belongs in which line.p  pI send that data to the webserver.

Negative 2595 pIm designing and implementing a scripting language, and for the reading stage Im taking the timetested and straightforward approach of splitting the code up into tokens lexical analysis followed by using a stackbased AST generator to squeeze syntactic structure out of the token stream parsing. However, Im facing an issue with strings, comments, and how they interact.p  pfor reference, code in my language uses codecode to start commentsp  pThis might be the wrong approach, but Im performing the lexical analysis step using regular expressions.  For codencode kinds of tokens, I run codencode tokenization passes on my code, with each pass finding substrings that match the given regex and tagging them, until eventually every character is tagged.  Each regex ignores matches that lie within alreadytagged sections of source, only tagging unclaimed land.  This is useful, because you wouldnt want, for example, a codenumbercode token infiltrating a token like codetranslate3dcode.p  pThe issue Im running into is with comments embedded in strings and strings embedded in comments.  I dont know how to simultaneously make thisp  precodeThe  is my favorite character  Its so happylooking codepre  pbe tagged as a string, and have thisp  precode handles the Exception just logs it to a file nobody ever reads and moves on codepre  pbe tagged as a comment.  It seems that either way, you have to impose some ordering on the passes of lexical analysis, and that either the comment or the string pass is going to win and tag a substring it has no business tokenizing.  For example, either the string is tagged like so Im using XML notation because its a good way to represent tagged regions of text.  XML is not actually used in my program at any pointp  precodeThe ltcommentgt is my favorite character  Its so happylookingltcommentgt codepre  por the comment is tagged like thisp  precodeltcommentgt ltcommentgtltstringgthandlesltstringgtthe Exception just logs it to a file and moves on codepre  pEither its assumed a string starts in the middle of a comment or a comment starts in the middle of a string.p  pWhats odd is that it seems that this system of regex passes tagging substrings is emexactlyem what the syntax highlighting on a text editor does, and comments and strings work fine there.  Ive already developed the textmatesubmlime text 2 syntax definition for my language, and all I had to do was in a simplified version of the actual format usedp  precodeltsyntaxgt     ltcolorgt         stringcolor     ltcolorgt     ltpatterngt         []     ltpatterngt ltsyntaxgt ltsyntaxgt     ltcolorgt         commentcolor     ltcolorgt     ltpatterngt         .     ltpatterngt ltsyntaxgt codepre  pEverything works fine when Im writing sample code.  When I tried to emulate what I imagine the behavior of the text editor is, however, I ran into the problems mentioned above.  How can this be fixed, preferably in the most elegant way possible  Obviously, special handling could be added, stripping all the comments off the source code before any lexical analysis is done, except for comments inside strings which requires the reader reader in this case being the machine, not the human to detect what sections of code are strings emtwiceem, but Im sure there must be a better way, simply because sublime text only has knowledge of the regexes used to specify the two kinds of regions of code, and with only that information it behaves exactly as expected.p

Negative 2595 pHere is the thing. I can completely understand a concept of a multidimensional array lets consider 2D for a while made by pointer to array to pointers and so on...p  pWe do something like thisp  precode we can use dynamically defined size n and m int n  3, m  5  int T  new int [n] for int i  0  i lt n  i     T[i]  new int[m] codepre  pWhat we got is Check if Im right herep  ul li3 blocks of memory of 5 ints, placed somewhere in memoryli liOne additional block of memory of same size as number of the blocks of ints number of rows. This block is an array of pointers usually 4 bytes for pointer like int to those int rows. li liWhat we are interested in most   that is T which is of type T  a pointer to pointer. Which is exactly a pointer to an array of pointer, because in C an array is in fact a pointer pointing to a block of memory so t[] or t[0] means t, and t[x] means tx. li ul  pNow the problem is when we do sth like thisp  precodeint n  3, m  5  int T[n][m]  codepre  pWhat weve got is not what w could have doing the thing I showed before.  We get sth strange. What is T When printfing T, we get the same value as T[0]. It looks like we reserved a block of ints sized nm without additional array of pointers to rows. p  pMy question is does the compiler remembers the dimension of the array and number of rows and columns And when asking for T[i][j] it actually asks for Tinj so this n is stored somewhere  The problem is when we are trying to pass this thing T to a function. I dont know why but if n and m were constants its possible to pass T as a pointer to this array to function like in this programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt const int n  3, m  4   this is constant void add5int K[][m]      for int i  0  i lt n  i         for int j  0  j lt m  j             K[i][j]  5   int main       n x m array the most straight forward method     int T[n][m]      for int i  0  i lt n  i         for int j  0  j lt m  j             T[i][j]  im  j       for int i  0  i lt n  i              for int j  0  j lt m  j             printfd ,T[i][j]          printfn           printfn        adding 5 to all cells     add5T      printfit workedn       for int i  0  i lt n  i              for int j  0  j lt m  j             printfd ,T[i][j]          printfn            int ss      scanfd,ampss   codepre  pBut if n and m arent constant we cant.  So what I need is to pass dynamically created multidimensional arrays pointer to a function without manually allocating memory for that. How to do thisp

Negative 2595 pI am newbie in iOS development and I have a problem to understand file owner logic.p  pI have this situationsp  pI have two views ViewiPad, ViewiPhone and their controllers ViewControlleriPad, ViewControlleriPhone.

Lets say that there is a different position of this subview in iPad and iPhone view. This subview contains some labels, so I have to create IBOulets in subviews controller.p  pIf I understand, according to apples logic, file owner of view is a controller file which has access to this view and can communicate with it. So each of 3 views iPhone, iPad, subview has its own controller, it means that these controllers are file owners of these views.p  pBut when I load subview with code p  precode     NSArray nibContents  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedsubview ownerself optionsnil] codepre  pand add it as a subview to iPadiPhone view, there is a problem because this subview contains IBOutlets for labels and this labels are in subview controller and not in a iPhoneiPad controller.p  pThis error is shown thenp  blockquote   pTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSUnknownKeyException, reason [ltNSCFConstantString 0x7ab4 setValueforUndefinedKey] this class is not key value codingcompliant for the key view.p blockquote  pHow can I solve this I tried to put as a owner subviewController but it didnt help.

Negative 2595 pFirst of all I tried to google it, but I mostly only found discussions about how to define arrays in constants and other unrelated information.p  pI have a question regarding a solution to make my code more readable and pretty that just occured to me. Basically I have most functions return a status code that indicates success or, in case something went wrong, an error code. For this, I made a class called StatusCode that contains only constants, like sop  precodeltphp class StatusCode    const success  0   const badArgument  1   const badQuery  2   const outOfMana  3 Really just for demonstration purposes   ...  codepre  pThe purpose is to make magic numbers disappear from my code and make it clear what went wrong without having to look for an explaination somewherep  precodeif mana gt 10    Do some magic   return StatusCodesuccess  else    Oh god this is not good   return StatusCodeoutOfMana  codepre  pIt should also eliminate the possibility of accidently using duplicate error codes. Im pretty sure this adds a minor overhead to my application, but has made my code easier to understand in return. Is there some earth shattering reason not to do this Maybe an even better way to go about it p  pI have avoided the codedefineCONSTANT, valuecode approach because it seems less pretty and its a hassle to write on my German keyboard p

Negative 2595 pHey guys I put up a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netqQvt9 relnofollowthis JSFiddlea so you know what Im talking about since its a bit hard to explain. This JS is using a simple regex code[19][09]3code to detect a 5 digit number 1000099999. This works ok and after inputing 5 digits in this range the color turns to green, otherwise the color stays on red. The issue is when deleting character after 5 digits is reached, the color does not return to red like it should but instead stays green until only two characters are left.

Negative 2595 pI made an AIR application that uses the logitech c920 webcam for image capturing. The camera can display and record 720p and 1080p perfectly when Im using the Logitech software. But when I use 720p in my AIR app there is obvious lag. Still useable, but annoying. 1080p is unacceptable in terms of lag. All this is on an i3 laptop. On my i7 desktop there is much less lag and I can do 1080p, but its still not nearly as good as when Im using the Logitech software. p  pThe other odd thing is my older camera, the Logitech 9000 doesnt seem to work properly anymore in Flash or Air. The lag times are several seconds. p  pMy questions are 1 Do the logitech drivers use GPU acceleration to make the webcams work lightning fast even on a slow i3 computer while Flash cannot 2 Why does the older camera give such crumby performance now whether on the i3 or i7 Did Flash change how it handles cameras or something  3 Will the Flash Player be updated to allow GPU acceleration for webcamsp

Negative 2595 pIve been looking for hours on this I cant really come up with anything thats going to work. Hopefully I can gain some insight here.p  pHere is the problem guys. Im trying to come up with a better solution for sorting inventory. The particular items have bar codes on them so I figured it would be easy to hop in excel and plug away.

For examplep  precodeModel Input     Location st1000dm003     1 ST336706LC      2 st1000dm003     1 st1000dm004     3 ST336705LC      4 st1000dm003     1 codepre  pPreferably, the numbering would start at 1 and move up. The group of items in column A might not always be the same, so a table with the model number and the location will not work. It has to be able to tell if its seen that before and what number was assigned or assign a new one if it has not been seen. The other issue that Id most likely run into, is that Id like to be able to run this on Office Mobile for Office 365 on Android at some point. Any help is really appreciatedp

I use port 8088 on my Apache server. But now I am able to use [localhost]8088 and phpsite8088 though theres no virtual host named phpsite and if I go for techsupport.com8088 I get nothing.p  pHeres my vhost contentp  precode Virtual Hosts   Required modules modlogconfig   If you want to maintain multiple domainshostnames on your  machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations  use only namebased virtual hosts so the server doesnt need to worry about  IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.   Please see the documentation at   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4vhostsgt  for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.   You may use the command line option S to verify your virtual host  configuration.    VirtualHost example  Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.

We are staring out now and do not grasp many advanced concepts.p  pstrongtldrstrong lets imagine you have a codeBookcode. The codeBookcode is a dynamic array of codePagescode. Each codePagecode can be a codeWrittenPagecode or a codeDrawnPagecode. If you want to print all the codePagescode you use a codevirtual methodcode. If you just want to print the codeDrawnPagescode or codeWrittenPagescode youll have to do some sort of filtering inside the codeBookcode.

Negative 2595 pAs far as I know, using a language with Garbage Collection means there will be time intervals, inside which entire application is stopped. But Im curious about the scope of this stops.p  pFor example, there are codePortAudiocode bindings for Java, and there are 2 modes of operation, which differ in control direction. In one mode you call PortAudio to put some data that it must play and in other mode PortAudio calls you callback function to fill its buffers with data. I am wondering, why Java bindings for PortAudio dont allow second mode using callback. The explanation is, as can be read a hrefhttpportaudio.comdocsv19doxydocsclasscom11portaudio11PortAudio.html relnofollowherea codeThis Java binding does not support audio callbacks because an audio callback should never block. Calling into a Java virtual machine might block for garbage collection or synchronization. So only the blocking readwrite mode is supported.code This implies that in other case GC should not be a problem emBut whyem I dont understand this.p  pAnd how the situation will differ in other programming languages with GC especially interesting are C and D. What things should I take care of if I want to implement an audio player that never ever drops out samples in language with GC while using only 1 process And is it possible at allp  pPreviously I was participating in developing a kind of VoIP software in Java and there was serious problems with dropouts which correlated in time with GCs. But doing music player should be easier, I think, because latency is not a problem here and I can use huge buffer for audio data.p  h2Updateh2  pI am interested only in free and open source solutions. So, for example, using an alternative but nonfree implementation of Java runtime is not an option for me to use. But its interesting to know anyway.p

The problem I am running in to is that when the label is active it does not fully recognize the styles I have applied. I want the button to visually look as though it has been pressed, but right now the top border in the css is not being recognized. It looks as if the button is being pressed, but since the top border is not working it shifts the buttons below as if there is no top border added.

Negative 2595 pim using WebSockets to send data from my node.js server to my clients. Since the data can be kind of large, the UI thread used to block, so no user interaction or video playing was possible during the data was received. Thats when i stumbled over WebWorkers, and i also managed to get them work together with WebSockets.p  papp.jsp  precode...  var worker  new Workerworker.js  worker.addEventListenermessage, functione      console.logWorker said , e.data , false  worker.postMessageinit  ... codepre  pworker.jsp  precodefunction initWebSocket   var connection  new WebSocketwshostport, [soap, xmpp]  connection.onopen  function       connection.sendPing  Send the message Ping to the server    Log errors connection.onerror  function error    console.logWebSocket Error   error    Log messages from the server connection.onmessage  function e    console.logServer   e.data   self.postMessageWorker received    e.data     self.addEventListenermessage, functione  switch e.data      case init         initWebSocket         break     default         self.postMessageUnknown command   e.data      , false codepre  pAll im doing so far is receive the data. Of course, later on i intend to do more stuff with it. But my problem is The UI thread is still blocking when large files arrive. Did i get something wrong herep  pUPDATEp  pActually, i have to revise my previous comment. Obviously chrome had cached some of my files i was sending before, so i didnt realize the problem starts already with files way smaller than 300MB currently, im testing a 50MB file. The ui blocks until the file has been completly received. What im currently doing is the following Im loading an index page with a video playing. Also, on the same page, i put a button which starts a worker. The worker does send an xhr request to the server and gets a 50MB file. So i just dismissed WebSockets for the sake of it. Whats happening when i click the button The video freezes until the complete data has been received. When i do the same and let the worker just calculate numbers in a forloop, the video keeps playing. So it seems to have something to work with using the network, but not specifically WebSockets. Is it possible that WebWorkers just cant work with network stuffp
Negative 2595 pIm using Font Awesome. Sometimes  and I havent figured out the pattern yet, unfortunately  the icons arent working in Safari.

And then, after some time, it reverts to not working again.p  pIm serving Font Awesome from Nginx. That emcouldem be relevant, because I originally served these files without the proper headers, which broke Font Awesome in Safari. Im wondering if maybe somehow Safari could have cached the nonheader versions of the files, and maybe somehow keeps using them even when cache is cleared maybe its caching fonts somewhere else But why would it revert to the broken version. p  pOkay, this isnt much to go on I know, but any ideas, has anyone else experienced this Thank you p  pEdited to add screenshot of broken behaviorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6Nlgn.png altenter image description herep

My grid items have a percentagebased width 100, 66.666666etc, 33.33333etc. For some reason, when I pass a function to the codecolumnWidthcode option, it always gives the container a height of 0.

Negative 2595 pIm trying to have HorizontalScrollViews in the fragments of a Swipeable Tab  ViewPager.p  pMy idea is that when you swipe your finger from say right to left, first the HorizontalScrollView scrolls to the right, and when it reaches the edge, the viewpager starts swiping to the next tab.p  pIf I try to make it directly just by putting the HorizontalScrollView in, then first the HorizontalScrollView gets the event and scrolls by a little 510 pixels but then the viewpager catches the event and starts swiping.p  pI tried extending the HorizontalScrollView to prevent the viewpager from catching the event while its scrolling, but when it reaches the edge I cant make it intercept it so he starts swiping.p  pMy CustomHorizontalScrollViewp  precodepublic class CustomHorizontalScrollView extends HorizontalScrollView      private boolean scrolling  false       Override     public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent MotionEvent event         ifisOnLeftEdge ampamp isOnRightEdge             getParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEventtrue                   return super.onInterceptTouchEventevent          Override     public boolean onTouchEvent MotionEvent event         ifisOnLeftEdge ampamp isOnRightEdge             getParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEventtrue                   ifscrolling             getParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEventtrue          ifevent.getActionMasked  MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE             scrolling  true         else ifevent.getActionMasked  MotionEvent.ACTIONUP             scrolling  false          return super.onTouchEventevent            private boolean isOnLeftEdge         return getScrollX  0          private boolean isOnRightEdge         return getChildAt0.getRight  getWidthgetScrollX       codepre  pIs there anyway I can do thatp  p EDIT p  pI tried to recreate the problem in a simple project.

Not too good, as i dont need to wait for writing different files.pli lipAdd somekind of concurrent queue for writers. If same file is already processing, writer should decide if it wants to cancel previous task rewriting or get previous task from cache and add own changes merge. If reader would want to access the same file, just return data from a queue.  Seems to be overcomplicated.pli lipForce readers to use one thread for all writers. Then, id have no problems with multiplie attempts of access to the same file.  Seems good as a temporary solution, thats the main question here.

Negative 2595 pIm writing a series of test set automation suites in HP UFT 12. The trouble is we need to know whenif the browser is hanged to prevent UFT from also hanging or throwing an error message and waiting for the user to respond. The trouble is that if the test is run then nobody will be able to respond to it until the morning. We would like to log the error and continue with the next test iteration if possible. The trouble is there seems to be no way to detect if the browser has hanged.p  pExample So I have this test script. It checks for objects and does some work on the browser window. The trouble is that if an item on the browser doesnt exist, it might not be a total failure, just that the action for that item cannot be performed. So simply checking if objects exist isnt the answer, and besides simply checking if an object exists doesnt guarantee that it might exist but be hidden or moved offscreen. for anybody whos been writing code in QTPUFT for any length of time will knowp  pSo imagine that Im running this test. And while the test is executing I take control of the browser that it is driving and type in the URL www.crashie8.com which promptly crashes the browser simulating a hang. Now is when things get interesting. p  pQTPUFT should be able to deal with this. If I leave the code unchanged UFT will eventually throw an error message, which, as described above, doesnt help me.p  pI can add the line On Error Resume Next at the beginning of every functiontest script, but this promptly hangs UFT, then everything is hanged and its just a bigoletraffic pileup on my desktopp  pDoing anything such as On Error ExitAction or On Error ExitTest or On Error ExitActionIteration or On Error ExitGlobalIteration all give compiletime errors Invalid Syntaxp  pMaybe Im missing some capability that I didnt know or understand in the Check Points or the Recovery Sceneriosp  pEDIT The solution Go into the Script SettingsRun and setting the option When error occurs during run session Stop run. The Run results will display errors indicating that there was a failure identifying the browser.p  pDoesnt work fully. While the option Stop Run will indeed stop the run, it stops the run even if an object is misidentified, however, when such a simple error happens the script should be able to continue. So setting the option to Continue with next step will solve the problem of continuing with small errors, but will still hang UFTQTP when the browser hangs. Also the option Continue with next Action Iteration has the same problem. So there appears to be no middle ground, and there doesnt appear to be any code that can solve this problem either.p  pI suppose the only possible solution for now is the option Stop Run although it is very annoying that it would kick all the way out and there is no way to continue at all in any way, and all of the other continue options similarly fail, and there is no coding solution. Because On Error ExitAction doesnt even let you save thanks to a syntax error that shouldnt even really be an error Any other options that anybody has developedp  pEDIT I guess the Stop Run doesnt even work every time either. There has got to be a better solution Anybodyp  pFigured out that the likely cause of the UFTQTP crash is because of the IE plugin. But cannot disable the IE plugin, because UFTQTP wont be able to test against IE without it. So yet again we are in a catch22 Seriously, hasnt anybody at HP thought about this stuffp

Also, earlier in the same project, I create and use an fstream pointer to an strongexistingstrong file no problem using the same syntax, with no openmode qualifiers I of course tried not using openmodes too for the file above  reading from the existing file only though.p  pWhen I instead use nonpointer access, as inp  precodestdfstream TESToutName.cstr, oM1  etc, ancillary changes codepre  pall works fine.p  pI am confused.

Negative 2595 pI have a strange phenomenon, while investigating the performance of a query, I noticed that it takes 6 seconds to run the query in sql server management studio, but it only takes .6 seconds when invoked from within a vb.net application.p  pI am getting the time stats from set statistics time in SSMS, and using System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch in vb.net application.p  pI have done everything I can think of to rule out caching, and verifying that the query within vb.net code is not deferred somehow.

Ive restarted sql server, Ive restarted the vb.net application, Ive used p  precodeUSE ltdbnamegt GO CHECKPOINT GO DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS GO codepre  pWhen running the query in SSMS, flushing the cache as above makes no difference, indicating that the query does not benefit from any caching.

It goes that fast even after restarting both the sql server and the vb.net app.p  pI dont think the code of the query is terribly relevant, other than to note that it calls a function which in turn uses sqls version of recursion.p  pAnother note is that when executing the query from SSMS, I can speed it up by adding a needed index, after which it runs in about 1.4 seconds.  When executed from vb.net app, it runs in .23 seconds with the index.p  pThe question is, what could sql server be doing differently depending on whether a query is invoked from ssms vs. vb.nt, to result in this performance differencep  pedit to provide codep  pHere is the query called in vb.net, yes it is embedded in a linq query in a rather otdd way, and yes I have verified that the linq query is not deferred for purposes of timing it.p  precode   fnName  AT.fnPlanItemLevelSortReverse    isParent  1    foo  From d In DBConn.sqlSelect             SELECT DENSERANK OVER ORDER BY SUBSTRINGSort,1,3 AS [GroupNumber], amp                  PlanID, MasterItemID, ItemID, Level, Sort  amp                  FROM  amp fnName amp PlanID ORDER BY Sort                  , GetCommandItemPlanID, SqlDbType.BigInt, planId.OfTypeOf DataRowView                  Select New PlanItemRaw With                   .PlanID  WrapperOf Longd.ItemPlanID                  , .MasterItemID  WrapperOf Longd.ItemMasterItemID                  , .ItemID  WrapperOf Longd.ItemItemID                  , .GroupNumber  WrapperOf Integerd.ItemGroupNumber                  , .Level  WrapperOf Integerd.ItemLevel                  , .IsParent  WrapperOf Integerd.ItemLevel  isParent                  , .Sort  WrapperOf Stringd.ItemSort                  .ToArray codepre  pNote that isParent is irrelevant to the SQL query, only used by the linq query.p  pDBConn.sqlSelect is homebrew, and a wrapper for the following, items is nothing in this casep  precode Public Function sqlSelectByVal sqlCommand As String, ByVal commandTimeout As Integer,                            ByVal ParamArray items As SQLCommandItem As DataView         Using conn As New SqlClient.SqlConnectionconn             Using cmd As New SqlClient.SqlCommandsqlCommand, conn                 cmd.CommandTimeout  commandTimeout                 Call AddParamesterstoCommandcmd, items                 Using da As New SqlClient.SqlDataAdapter                     da.SelectCommand  cmd                     Call logFullSQLStringForDebuggingsqlSelect, cmd                     Using custDS As New DataSet                         da.FillcustDS                         If custDS.Tables.Count  0 Then                             sqlSelect  Nothing                         Else                             sqlSelect                                 custDS.TablescustDS.Tables.Count1.DefaultView                         End If                     End Using                 End Using             End Using             conn.Close         End Using     End Function codepre  hr  pNow here is the query in SSMSp  precodeset statistics time on select DENSERANK over order by substringsort,1,3 as [groupnumber],        PlanID, MasterItemID, ItemID, [level], Sort     from at.fnPlanItemLevelSortReverse3538     order by Sort set statistics time off codepre  pNote that the parameter 3538 is identical to the value passed via PlanId in the vb.net code.

The f2.8 aperture guarantees fast shutter speeds, active autofocus and minimal blur in low light situations. The ATX 116 PRO DXII lens is designed for digital cameras with APSCsize CMOS or CCD sensors. Its angle of view ranges from 82104 and it can focus as close as 11.81 0.3 m. Nine shutter blades in the aperture help to create soft outoffocus backgrounds and two SuperLow Dispersion glass elements and two aspheric elements help to achieve this lens excellent contrast, sharpness and minimal chromatic aberration. As an update to their ATX 116 PRO DX, Tokina has improved the multilayer coatings to minimize light reflection and improve optical performance. The PRO DXII has a silent focusing motor which is ideal if shooting video with your digital camera.  Tokinas Onetouch Focus Clutch Mechanism allows the photographer to switch between autofocus and manual focus with a simple push of the focus ring. Snapping it forward into autofocus and back into manual focus is all that needs be done, theres no need to adjust the AFMF switch on the camera body. This is a durable, bright, qualityoptic AF lens.  Note While the lens is designed for APSC sized sensors it can work on full frame DSLR cameras as well, however some vignetting will occur.ltdivgt ltligt ltligtltinput idtab2 typeradio nametabs gt

Negative 2595 pIve an application where I use twitter streaming API with status filters. I use the twitter4j client for this. The status filters are determined at runtime and they are added into a queue. On adding filters into the queue, separate thread is created which in turn spawns streaming http connection to twitter. Along with these filters, I have added followings field to track the tweets made by a particular user. The same twitterUserId is added as part of all threads. When the user with this twitterUserId tweets, I should ideally see all the threads fetching this tweet. But I dont see this happening always. At times only few threads see the tweet and sometimes all of them see this tweet. I see that this functionality is quite flaky. What can the issue with thisp

Negative 2595 pWhen designing java classes, what are the recommendations for achieving CPU cache friendlinessp  pWhat I have learned so far is that one should use POD as much as possible i.e. int instead of integer. Thus, the data will be allocated consecutively when allocating the containing object. E.g.p  precodeclass Local      private int data0     private int data1      ...  codepre  pis more cache friendly thanp  precodeclass NoSoLocal      private Integer data0     private Integer data1     ...  codepre  pThe latter will require two separate allocations for the Integer objects that can be at arbitrary locations in memory, esp. after a GC run. OTOH the first approach might lead to duplication of data in cases where the data can be reused.p  pIs there a way to have them located close to each other in memory so that the parent object and its containing elements will be in the CPU cache at once and not distributed arbitrarily over the whole memory plus the GC will keep them togetherp

Negative 2595 pIm having a bit of trouble with Matlabs codeuicontrolcode handling. Heres the situationp  pMy programmatic GUI contains an strongeditable text fieldstrong. This field originally contains a strongnumeric valuestrong and is supposed to always contain one. In order to ensure that, the codeStringcode parameter is to be repeatedly checked, converted to numeric, and reentered into the codeStringcode property of the codeuicontrolcode. This is supposed to happen whenever a user enters a visible character into the text field.p  pAdditionally, the program is supposed to notice at any point whether the current value of said text field differs from the original value, which is stored in memory. If the user closes the figure, a strongmodal dialogstrong opens and asks if he wants to save the change to that value or discard it. If the figure is then reopened through the rest of the GUI, the value of the text field starts out as either the same it started out as before if the user discarded the changes or the changed value defined by the user.p  pBoth of these things fail in some instances because of a strange behaviour The codeuicontrolcodes codeStringcode property is strongonly updated after the codeuicontrolcode loses focusstrong. This is not a problem if the user wants to do other things on that GUI or knows how to handle this. emI can also live with my text field only updating to a meaningful numeric value after it loses focus.embr The problem is, when I close the figure via Windows red X button in the top right corner emafter changing the value of the text field, but without first clicking somewhere elseem, the codeStringcode value is never updated, so the emcodeCloseRequestFcncode doesnt notice the changeem and simply closes the window. Even pausing for a whopping 100ms and then explicitly calling the text fields codeCallbackcode from within the codeCloseRequestFcncode doesnt help, it just closes without my dialog. The reverse is also true, if I do change the value, click somewhere else, and then change it back, it will display the dialog unless I first click somewhere else emagainem.p  pSo the question is this strongHow do I ensure the codeuicontrolcode correctly updatesexecutes its codeCallbackcode when I click the red X button provided by Windowsstrongbr And bonus question How do I execute this Callback on the fly in order to correct any impossible values the user enters as soon as he does e.g. letters other than codeecode and codeicodep  hr  pHeres the isolated part of my GUI that causes the problem, copy into a file called guitest.m and run in order to test what Im talking about.p  precodefunction guitest      changed  false  tracks changes to catch closing without saving     startval  1  the starting value      handles.figure  figureResize,off,Toolbar,none,Menu,...         none,Name,Change text field value,CloseRequestFcn,...         closefig,Visible,off  not visible until fully created      handles.textfield  uicontrolStyle,edit,Units,normalized,...

Negative 2595 pI am pretty new to programming and Im trying to build a code that does the following thingsp  p1 Two short functions that return an equation. 2 Use those two equations in another function that will compute some things and return TWO variables.  3 The main will then be in a different file that will use the two values outputted by the function described in step 2. p  pCurrently, I have steps 1 and 2 in one file and function 2 is the main.

Negative 2595 pIve searched for answers here many times, but this is my first time asking a question of my own.  I have about 15 years of Cf experience with versions 410, so, although Im no expert, I know what Im doing with most things.  p  pI currently have a project that I took over from another developer.  Part of the application outputs data from a SQL Server 2008 database to an Excel file that has three sheets or tabs, which are created in order, left to right.  I am working to fix a problem in which when opening the Excel file, the first and third sheets are grouped.  Next to the file name in the title bar, it says [Group] and both sheets appear to be active.  The problem with this is that, if the user were to, say, highlight row 5 in sheet 3, row 5 also gets highlighted in sheet 1.  I have searched everywhere with every search string I can think of and cant find anything  I even tried recreating a skeleton of the functionality based on the CF documentation and ran into the same problems.  I have figured out a few things on my own.p  pFirst, the middle sheet is not affected at all.  Second, once in Excel, if you select the middle sheet, everything else gets fixed of course, thats not a great solution for the end user.  Third, if I create the spreadsheet with xmlformat equal to false and output it as an xls, this problem goes away.  Finally, I tried adding an extra line of code to set the active sheet back to the first one once the third is generated.  This did break the grouping problem, but it undid any row or column sizing in the first sheet and I cant get it back.p  pMy code is below.

Negative 2595 pIm interested in hashing database field values as part of an attempt to detect changes in tables.p  pThe database in question Vertica has a HASH function, mainly for internal use I guess, as well as other hashes.  The internal function assigns a nonnull hash value to NULL in fact, it differs for NULLs of different datatypes.p  pI might end up using that internal hash function, but if it turns out that its statistical properties and collision avoidance arent that good, how can I use other provided functions like md5 etc I dont need strong cryptographic hashes when they all send NULL to NULLp  pOf course I could just assign another hash value to NULL, but I dont know an elegant way to do that.

Thats it.p  pI want to know how to count that how many bytes transferred to the client Just like counter how many times downloaded.

I came across various posts on chrome webdriver google group page, users mentioning this limitation and answer to it was to not fix it. So anyways, now I am trying to make it work using javascript to scroll horizontally and then do the findelement by xpath again to see if the elements to the right are loaded. But for some strange reason I cannot seem to get the scrolling horizontally to work. I am using C Javascript executor.p  precodeIJavaScriptExecutor js  IJavaScriptExecutor Driver js.ExecuteScriptscrollTo3000,0  whatever X value I use chrome is not scrolling to the right.  codepre  pI have also tried scrollX and no luck. Is there something wrong with my codep  pEdited forgot that I was using X for horizontal not Yp

Negative 2595 pI was going through the twitter a hrefhttpstwitter.github.iofinagle relnofollowfinaglea library which is an asynchronous service framework in scala and I have some question regarding asynchronous libraries in general. p  pSo as I understand, the advantage of an synchronous library using a callback is that the application thread gets free and the library calls the callback as soon as the request is completed over the network. And in general the application threads might not have a 11 mapping with the library thread. p  ol liThe service call in the library thread is blocking rightli liIf thats the case then we are just making the blocking call in some other thread. This makes the application thread free but some other thread is doing the same work. Cant we just increase the number of application threads to have that advantageli ol  pIts possible that I misunderstand how the asynchronous libraries are implemented in JavaScala or JVM in general. Can anyone help me understand how does this workp
Negative 2595 pI have the following usecase multiple clients push to a shared Redis List. A separate worker process should drain this list process and delete. Waitmultiexec is in place to make sure, this goes smoothly. p  pFor performance reasons I dont want to call the drainprocess right away, but after x milliseconds, starting from the moment the first client pushes to the then empty list. p  pThis is akin to a distributed underscorelodash a hrefhttpslodash.comdocsdebounce relnofollowdebounce functiona, for which the timer starts to run the moment the first item comes in i.e. leading instead of trailingp  pIm looking for the best way to do this reliably in a fault tolerant way. p  pCurrently Im leaning to the following method p  ol liUse a hrefhttpredis.iocommandsset relnofollowRedis Seta with the codeNXcode and codepxcode method. This allows  ul lito only set a value a mutex to a dedicated keyspace, if it doesnt yet exist. This is what the codenxcode argument is used forli liexpires the key after x milliseconds. This is what the codepxcode argument is used for li ulli liThis command returns code1code if the value could be set, meaning no value did previously exist. It returns code0code otherwise. A code1code means the current client is the first client to run the process since the Redis List was drained. Therefore, li lithis client puts a job on a distributed queue which is scheduled to run in x milliseconds. li liAfter x milliseconds, the worker to receive the job starts the process of draining the list.li ol  pThis works on paper, but feels a bit complicated. Any other ways to make this work in a distributed faulttolerant way p  pBtw Redis and a distributed queue are already in place so I dont consider it an extra burden to use it for this issue.  p

Negative 2595 pI am expecting to be handling a huge number of data records, whereby around 20 codeuint8tcode keys will have millions of codeltint, structgtcode pairs associated with each of them ordered by codeintcode. These pairs are rather lightweight at 10 bytes, and need to be allocated dynamically.p  pInitially, I was using a codestdmapltuint8t, stdvectorltint, structgtgtcode but after studying the overhead associated with vectors, namely the codecapacitycode in p  blockquote   p3 machine words in total  codesizeofelementcode  codecapacitycodep blockquote  pas seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma118414581487804herea codecapacitycode typically has room for up to twice the actual number of elements which is seemingly detrimental.p  pInstead of a vector, I could use a stdmap, however the overhead of a hrefhttpinfo.prelert.comblogstlcontainermemoryusage relnofollow32 bytes per nodea also becomes very expensive for such light weight pairs. p  pI am unfamiliar with Boost and other C libraries, so was wondering whether anyone could advise on a solution where I could avoid manual dynamic memory allocationp  hr  pstrongEdit strong To clarify following a few questions in comments, the struct stored will contain 3 shorts to start with, and no further data structures.

Negative 2595 pso, im working on a project where I have to use a search button to find user information from a jdbc database, and so far Ive got some of the code to work and added fields and data to the database, but once i hit search in the jtextfield it doesnt display any data in the table.

Negative 2595 pIve been given a design library from a large cooperate client built utilizing Bootstrap 3 and Require.js.

Negative 2595 pIm doing a small intranet site for my employer. Im the only developer on it at this point. Woe be unto them. Im still very much a noob to web development.p  pIm running the dev version of this site with NetBeans as the server ultimately using EasyPHP. When I run the project in NetBeans, the browser has the site root as localhost8000 or whatever port. Nothing wrong there. When I try to run it directly thru EasyPHP, It has aliases which point to specified directories on my hard drive as the site roots, so the browser says something like 127.0.0.1Intranet as the site root. Unfortunately, that breaks everything in multiple ways. For one, the way I was getting the sites rootp  precode defineWEBROOT, filterinputINPUTSERVER, DOCUMENTROOT  defineSOURCEROOT, dirnameWEBROOT codepre  pcodeWEBROOTcode ended up pointing to the directory EasyPHP is installed, rather than the directory the site is in, so naturally any includes with codeWEBROOTcode in them broke. Instead, there was another SERVER key called codeCONTEXTDOCUMENTROOTcode that points to the right place. OK, easy enough to test if that key codeissetcode and use it if it is, but then, the links to my css and javascript files were broken, because they were linked in my code like codejs.jscode with a leading slash. I thought the leading codecode would automatically point to the site root, but instead it seems to point to the root in the browser, since the console said it couldnt find 127.0.0.1js.js when it should have been looking for 127.0.0.1Intranetjs.js.p  pDoes any of this make sense What does the leading slash actually do Should I link my css and js with my WEBROOT constants instead I dont want to do it with relative paths, because at this point there are a lot of directories and subdirectories in this site, any of which need to find WEBROOTjs.js or style.css.p  pAlthough the prod version is working its on a different computer with different server software, these errors make me think Im doing something wrong. Any thoughtsp  pThanksp  pPS. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4009966phpisfileandserverrootrelativepathsThis questionas answer speaks to my question somewhat, but Im wondering if anyone can explain the forward slash further.p

Negative 2595 pBasically, I was weighing up some options for a software idea I had. The web app thing is a bit of a constraint on the project, so Im assuming I would be writing this in js. p  pI need to create a drawable area for the user, which is okay, allow them to draw and then compare the input to a correct example. This is just an arrow, but the arrow can be double headed normal point arrow or single headed half an arrowhead, so the minute details are fairly important, as is the location.p  pNow, Ive read around for a few hours or so, and it seems to be that a good approach is to downsample the input so I am just comparing a couple of pixels. I am wondering though if there is a simpler way to achieve what I want here, and if there are good resources for learning what I feel is a very basic implementation of image recognition. Also having never implemented something like this, Im a little worried about the little details of something like this, like speed obviously feedback has to be fairly quick. p  pThanks. p

Negative 2595 pI wrote a programm that automatically writes new entries to a database as soon as new articles are available through an RSSFeed. It takes the title, date, etc. of that article and writes these informations in the database as a new entry. I also run a code that displays the most recent entries of the database to my website. All of this worked until the date changed to 2015. It orders the entries by month and day, but seems to ignore the year. So the new entries end up at the bottom of the list as I started this programm in october 2014. p  pHere is the query I use to select the entriesp  precoderes  db gt querySELECT  FROM himate ORDER BY Recent DESC Limit 20 codepre  pAnd here is a pic of how the database seems to look when ordered by the date of the entries note the entries are ordered from top to bottom, so the new entries should be at the bottom img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6RxwV.png altenter image description herep  pI have the feeling that it has something to do with the time format that I get from the RSSFeed, but as there are already many entries in the database and I have no influence to the format I receive through the feed, I would be relieved if there was a way to fix this without making changes to the time format.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pEDIT Thanks for the answers guys.

The oracle database is preexisting and I do not have the liberty of making schema changes to it and, oh, how I would if I could.p  pMy specific problem is that they have defined a table key as Raw16, which EF interprets nicely as a GUID when it builds the modle. However, due to a bug in other code, the column has only been populated with 12 bytes of data. So, when EF tries to map this to a GUID e.g. when I run a linq query that returns it, an exception occursp  blockquote   pByte Array for GUID must be exactly 16 bytes longp blockquote  pHow can I still access this table and use the PK as intended It does seem that this shorter data has been enough to uniquely identify a row thus far so, I think I can still count on it as a PK. p  pWhat I cant do is get EF to think of this column in the DB as anything other than a GUID. Can I force it to a string in order to use it and thus avoid the error abovep  pAny suggestions are appreciated.p

Negative 2595 pI have a class that represents a checking account, and in the checking account there is a class member that represents an account number.

But when I had excluded it from my code, each object had a different codeaccountNumbercode. The catch though was, that each time I ran my program the values never changed i.e. it generated random values for each object only once and then kept those values, which is why I implemented codesrandcode, but now all objects have the exact same codeaccountNumbercode, granted they change each time I run the program. What is the deal here Why were they all different before I implemented codesrandcode and never change, but now they change but apply to all objects Also just as a side note, I know this may look quite sloppy, but this is for an assignment that instructs me to do this IN the constructor, otherwise Id make a function. p

I agree with her that this algorithm runs in emO2supnsupem time  because to solve this problem, you have to consider the fact that for any element, you have two possibilities, it can either be in the set or not. And because you have n elements, your problem will have 2supnsup possibilities so the problem would be solved with O2supnsup time.p  pHowever I believe that I have a compelling argument that my algorithm runs in emOnem space. I know that space complexity is the total space taken by an algorithm with respect to the input size a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orggfact86 relnofollow Space Complexitya and is relative to the the depth of a recursive callremember this from some Youtube video I watchedp  pAn example I have is generating [1,2,3] as a subset of [1,2,3].

Each of these recursive calls will have its own stack frame. So from this, I concluded that the space complexity is emOnem Does anyone see any flaws in my proof p

Negative 2595 pI am developing a webapp using sencha framework supported in various countries.If I set the Google chrome language as China, the app doesnt render properly. The whole CSS styling is gone for a toss. I cannot rewrite the whole style just for a specific language China... After a lot of debugging I found that the Google Chrome always set a minimum font size of 12px for Chinese. This is causing the issue and hence my styles are broken. I need the fontsize to be set as 2.94px. How can I override this 12px which the Chrome is calculating  In other languages, the Chrome sets the fontsize as 2.94 itself. Only China and Korean language has this different font size computed by Chrome... Please help on this issue.p
Negative 2595 pIm currently developing a clientserver architecture between a tablet client and a MACPC server. I am doing on both side some realtime rendering and I need communication between the two. p  pThe problem is that I need to do some operation on the string I get from my client which is basically a rotation matrix. This string is therefore to be at most 16 float numbers that I previously transform into a comaseparatedvalue string. Therefore what I should get from my client is something likep  blockquote   p1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0p blockquote  pServerside, I do some processing of that string to get back my rotation matrix as a float array of 16 elements. The problem is that sometimes I get more than just 16 elements from the client on the server side at once. I for instance getp  blockquote   p1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0   1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0   1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0p blockquote  pSo that when I try to split it, I go above the 16 element limits which is not good at all for me. My question is is there a way to prevent the server andor the client to readsend more than one complete matrix at a time Since Im using a tablet and some realtime rendering I would like to be able to save as much processing power as possible.p  pHere is the code that Im using just snippets as files are quite bigp  pClientp  precodeif connected  true ampamp matrixupdated  true ampamp this.hasMatrixChanged             try                  this.inFromServer  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderclientSocket.getInputStream                 this.outToServer new DataOutputStreamclientSocket.getOutputStream                 this.sentence  this.getStringFromMatrix                 outToServer.writeBytessentence  n                 this.hasServerProcessed  false                  System.arraycopymatrix, 0, previousMatrix, 0, 16 I check whether the matrix changes enough for me to send it to the server             catch Exception e                  Log.eClientActivity, S Error, e                          this.matrixupdated  false  codepre  pServer p  precodewhile readsize  recvsock , clientmessage , 2000 , 0 gt 0       smatrix  clientmessage   smatrix is a true c string     pthreadmutexlockampmymutex     pthreadcondwaitampmycondition, ampmymutex  prevent realtime rendering to try and use the matrix at the same time as this function     stdstringstream sssmatrix     whilestdgetliness, tok, ,          matrix[i]  atoftok.cstr         i           i  0      pthreadmutexunlockampmymutex  codepre

So I create a memory leak here. It seems that making the inner class nonstatic wont resolve this issue  the reference returned from codegetAuthTokenForActiveAccountcode will still prevent from the outer codeActivitycode to be garbage collected. Is there any way I could achieve what I try to do without leaking the contextli licodeThreadcode is eligible for garbage collection once its coderuncode method returns, right But in my case I want this thread to stick around because it also functions as codeAccountManagerFuturecode  it should be kept in memory until all references to it are gone. My question is this is it enough to keep a strong reference to codeThreadcode for preventing it from being garbage collected If not, how could I force this codeThreadcode to stick around until all references are goneli ol
Negative 2595 pLets say we have a long list of posts on a single page. Each of those posts has a hidden codedivcode with multiple codeimgcode tags inside it. When a user clicks on the post, the images inside the hidden codedivcode should be showcased in a modal gallery.p  pWhich approach is better SEOwise  outputting the Bootstrap modal  image gallery markup for each post and unhiding it whenever the user clicks on the post, or having a single hidden modal and codeclonecodeing images to itp  pIm leaning towards the first solution because it is way easier to implement. The second one requires listening to DOM events as I should only initialize the gallery after the images have been cloned to the gallery codedivcode inside the modal and thus is a bit trickier. Also, Im not so keen about copying DOM nodes here and there.p  pWhich is the better approachp  pstrongEDITstrong I suppose that it is better to output all images during page load instead of loading them up using AJAX if SEO is important, rightp
Negative 2595 pI have a project I am working on that requires some users to be authenticated via facebook and others to sign up using a custom model. The facebook users will not have the same sign up credentials as the custom model. For example there will be a restaurant owner sign up and a customer signup. The customer will not have to put a street address location, they can simply login.p  pMy intentions were to have the restaurant owners sign up via the custom profile model and the facebook users to simply login via the defualt social auth, but whenever I combine the two, social auth starts to use the custom model because I define a custom user model within settings. Is there a way to distinguish to the python social auth backend to only use the default or a way to update my current custom user model to have a facebook segment. I have searched the web for a long time for this, but can not seem to find anything that can combine the two besides 1, but it did not work successfully. I can however get one or the other working successfully depending on if I specify a user model in my settings.py file or not.p  pIt is quite simple, but I do not know of a way to get social auth to look at its default and djangos authentication to look at my custom model.p  p1a hrefhttpcode.techandstartup.comdjangoprofiles relnofollowhttpcode.techandstartup.comdjangoprofilesap

Negative 2595 pOver the past month, Ive been wrestling with all sorts of issues in trying to get my Construct 2 game ported to iOS and Android. Eventually I found varying levels of success on the two platforms, but of course, updates still need to happen and are continuing to give me a headache.p  pWith my first accepted build on iOS, I found that my game was asking for the users location on startup. I dont use any location services in game, so I wasnt sure why it was popping up, but I decided Id just do some research and try to kill the prompt in the next update.

Negative 2595 pstrongLast edit Ive found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8057499chromewontapplycsshoverstylewhenleftmousebuttonishelddownthisa question. It looks to be a Chrome issue.strongp  hr  pIm trying to drag a jQuery UI draggable element over an element which on CSS codehovercode bring up codezindexcode based some of its childrens. I need that those childrens to accept my dragging object they are all jQuery UI droppable.p  pHere is the a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net3kwgmw1d18 relnofollowjsFiddlea.p  pHow it should work drag a blue circle on the left element to another circle on the right element. Draggable element is turning in a red one, and all droppable elements must bring on top and become green bordered. Same behavior is expected if we drag a circle from right element to the left one.p  pAfter each codedropcode event, draggable and droppable elements involved become heavy bordered, as a visual feedback of the user action.p  pHowever, Ive tested this one in the following browsers, each of them have some issuesp  ul liChrome 43.0.2357.124 m  the CSS codehovercode state isnt triggered, but droppable elements accept the draggable one. codeactiveClasscode and codehoverClasscode from droppable element refuse to work, and the CSS codehovercode have the same issue.li liFirefox 38.0.5  the CSS codehovercode state is triggered only if I use codecursorAtcode option in draggable element. codeactiveClasscode and codehoverClasscode from droppable element also works fine. Problem in Firefox is that droppable codedropcode event isnt fired or I reffer the element itself wrong.li liInternet Explorer 11.0.20  nothing works, it fires some errors in the console Access is denied, jQuery is undefined,  is undefined.li ul  pFor almost one and a half day I try to figure out if this a jQuery glitch, a browser problem, or is anything wrong with my code. And of course to find a cross browser solution for this problem.p  pThanks for your time and your interestp  hr  pEdit updated jsFiddle link.p

It serves as a fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  start page path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On       Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.      If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the      project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper      resolution of the app.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will      work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, onesize      fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment      the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.     RewriteCond REQUESTURI1 ..2     RewriteRule .  [EBASE1]       Sets the HTTPAUTHORIZATION header removed by apache     RewriteCond HTTPAuthorization .     RewriteRule .  [EHTTPAUTHORIZATIONHTTPAuthorization]       Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content      with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial      rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an      endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt      redirect gt request gt ....      So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule app.php.

Negative 2595 pwe have many photos on ftp dist sorted to folders by trip. We want to nice online photo gallery from this, but not transfer data anywhere. Ideal for us use case is owncloud a hrefhttpsowncloud.org relnofollowhttpsowncloud.orga, but is horrible slow and is full of bug, for example if I reload page some folders disappears and at the next refresh will appear. p  pSo I have simply question, is there some similiar solution. Where I say hey this is ftp url this is user name and password and then I see our photo gallery like owncloud Some CMS, addon for umbraco or something We used Azure web apps so its not slow server. Ideal was simply authentificate, we do not want to have our photo public.p  pThaknsp

Negative 2595 pOn Windows, how to share an already allocated, unnamed piece of memory between processes p  pContextp  pI want to access the same physical memory from two different processes, without one of them knowing about it. Basically, I want to read process As memory from process B.p  pI thought about ReadProcessMemory but, from what Ive understood and I might be wrong, and if I am please tell me, ReadProcessMemory actually copies the memory form a physical address to another, mapping then the copy to process Bs virtual memory or putting it in an already mapped area, doesnt matter.p  pWhat I would like to be able to do is to map the same physical area from the two processes. I thought about CreateFileMappingMapViewOfFile, but again, from what Ive understood you need to explicitly name the area you want to map. I dont have a name for process As memory, all I know is process A virtual address of that memory from VirtualQueryEx . In my mind I believe this should be enough to get the job done, but i havent found the way, yet. Any tipp  pEDIT I should make clear that i dont want to share a word or something small, rather a set of virtual pages, so offsets and similars arent a problem.p

Negative 2595 pAfter upgrading from Freeswitch 1.2.9 1.2.9git20130506T233047Z7c88f35451 to Freeswitch 1.4.21 1.4.213564bit, freeswitch stopped dropping channels after they were hung up, and when we tried to do a manual codeuuidkillcode, it gives us this lovely errorp  precodeERR No such channel codepre  pEven though show channels shows that channel clearly there. From the bugs on jira.freeswitch.com that Ive seen, it looks like it may be a code problem. A little more info on our environmentcodep  pWe have a python twisted loop that connects to the client so the client can run commands on the server and vice versa. As soon as that twisted connection dies the client is closeddisconnected the channels are killed as well, but we need the channel to die before then as were taking a lot of calls per second and need them to die when the other end is disconnected. We cant close and reopen the client every time a call is done, or reconnect as that would take way too much time and defeats the purpose of our use of the software.p  pOnce again, this error only started happening when we changed to installing the freeswitch server using aptget instead of directly from source. This lets us get a new server up and running extremely faster, and we would rather not take the extra time to use our previous method. Please tell me if theres any code you would like to look at, and ask for any clarification you need, but we would really like this to be fixed soon. Thanks in advancep  pstrongEditstrong For more clarification, were mainly using codemodcallcentercode, codemodconferencecode, and codemodsofiacode with our software.p  pstrongEdit 2strong For a little more clarification, were running this on Ubuntu 14.04 Server p  pWe are using an ESL connection to connect and run commands in freeswitch from python, and we think thats the root of the problem. We tried exiting the connection, but that destroys both channels. p  pAlso, all of the bugs filed already for this problem on Jira are closed for not being bugs. I thought I may have a bit more success here, as it is a programming type question.p

If its updated just inside one thread, the other thread may still use old, invalid pointer. How to assure its updated in both but using methods through the pointer doesnt trigger the above errorp  pExtended infop  pThe smart glue logic library Im writing is used to pass and convert messages between a 3rd party software and a custom device. It consists of three essential threadsp  ul lia handler the main thread of the 3rd party app periodically calls a calculate function in my library to handle new updates  data to send, data receivedli lia sender thread that converts and sends whatever the handler pushed into the send bufferli lia listener thread that converts and pushes any data received from the device into receive buffer.li ul  pBoth the sender and the listener threads use the same utility class that handles network communication with the device upon initialization the class creates a connection to the device, and the two threads perform blocking reads or await for new data to send respectively. In case of any problems, the sender thread performs all maintenance work, while the listener thread enters a safe state awaiting return of connectivity.p  pNow, since the two threads share one connection to the device, they both share the same instance of the communication class, as a pointer to that class.p  pThe problem is in the procedure of reconnect  it involves destroying and creating the helper class instance exploiting safe shutdown and initialization already present in the destructor and constructor. As result the pointer changes. Without codevolatilecode its quite likely the listener wont receive the updated pointer. With volatile, it protests  needlessly, because codenccode the pointer wont change at a random moment  first the listener is notified of a problem, then it enters a safe state where it doesnt perform any operations on nc and notifies the sender its ready. Only then the sender performs the repair and notifies the listener to resume normal operation.p  pSo whats the right solution in this situationp
Negative 2595 pEDIT emIm glad no one has spent any time pointing out that the actual text in line 6 and 7 has a different number than the input for their respective function calls. Eventually Ill be doing it for those two numbers 724 and 27, but for the sake of troubleshooting, I picked numbers with much smaller sequences. So, if anyone was wondering, thats why...emp  pSo, Ive been learning Perl, and am relatively new to programming in general. My supervisor has a set of exercises for me to go through. The current one deals with Hailstone sequences, and she wants me to write a subroutine that prints the sequence for a given number.p  pThe problem Im running into is that, no matter what Ive tried, if I call the function more than once, it will produce the sequence for the first number I call the function with, but the second time I call the function, it produces the sequence of the first call followed by the sequence of the second. So, this code    p  precodeusrbinperl  use strict use warnings   print nThe hailstone sequence for 724 isn . amphail8 . nn print The hailstone sequence for 27 isn . amphail16 . nn  my n my seq sub hail      no warnings recursion     n  [0]     if n gt 1              push seq, n             if n  2  0                      n  n2              else                      n  3  n  1                          amphailn      else              push seq, n          return seq  codepre  pproducesp  precodeThe hailstone sequence for 724 is 8 4 2 1  The hailstone sequence for 27 is 8 4 2 1 16 8 4 2 1 codepre  pI understand that this is most likely due to the fact that codeseqcode doesnt get cleared out after each time the subroutine runs, but Ive tried as many different ways as I can think of to clear it out so that each time I call the subroutine, it displays the sequence for only that number but they all either result in what I show here, or in showing nothing. How do I go about clearing the array each time p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 2595 pSo I am attempting to create a menu that has dynamically generated paddingleft and right for each menu item so if the user resizes the browser then the menu items list does not spill over onto a second line. Below is the code that I have written to do this. And the code works just fine But not everything works smoothly in Safari. When you load the page in Safari, the script has no effect. Its only once I begin to resize my browser does the script run and change the padding widths. This does not happen on any other browser.p  precodeautowidth for menu items function setMenuWidth       var fullWidth  .mainnavigation.width     var numElements  .mainnavigation gt ul gt li gt a.length     var contentWidth  0, differenceWidth, paddingWidth      .mainnavigation gt ul gt li gt a.eachfunction         contentWidth  this.width           differenceWidth  fullWidth  contentWidth     paddingWidth  differenceWidthnumElements2      .mainnavigation gt ul gt li gt a.csspaddingleft, paddingWidth  px     .mainnavigation gt ul gt li gt a.csspaddingright, paddingWidth  px   setMenuWidth codepre  pAs you can see I created the function and then called it immediately after. And then in order to make it run on resize, I have called a resize event.p  precodewindow.resizefunction     scrollToResults     setMenuWidth  codepre  pI hope I have been as clear as possible. Has anyone ran into this issue before Thanks in advancep

Negative 2595 pI have been trying with no luck to combine one array into another, multidimensional array.  The first array, strongid1strong, is created from a mySQL query.  The second array, strongpictures1strong, is created with scandir and will hold up to 24 .jpg file pointers.  I have tried arraymerge, arraysplice, among others, and a variety of looping functions.  All to no avail. I have read the many forums on combining arrays with no luck.  Im new to PHP, and i think Im missing something basic here.

Negative 2595 pIm working on a project that requires an Add to Calendar widget.p  pPreviously, I was using a hrefhttpsgithub.comtardatejquery.addtocalendar relnofollowthis addtocalendar widgeta written in jQuery that worked great  it had support for multiple calendar systems and most importantly timezones which is important to the client that I am working with.p  pHowever, with the async refactor we did  switching to angular  the widget will load once and then after navigating to a different ui router page, it will disappear. Ive been trying to find a solution for this written in angular that also supports timezones and have not been able to find one.p  pFor the one I did find, Im wondering how I could add support for timezones a hrefhttpsgithub.comjshorangularaddtocalendar relnofollowto ita, or if there are better ones out there I just havent found yet.p  pstrongEDITstrong I should also that the angularaddtocalendar I found above requires a newer version of angular that I am unable to update to.p
