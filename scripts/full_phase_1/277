Positive 277 pI have been trying to figure this one out for a bit, not coming up with the right approach.  I read through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28243315attachjavafileassourceforjarinintellijthis questiona, which Id already tried, but its not working quite right.. using IntelliJ EAP 142.4675.3p  pWhat I am trying to do, is to debug a junit test using a jar extending the Provider class file Ive placed into JAVAHOMEjrelibext. I want that jar to be debuggable as well.p  pThe problem is, if I attach my source directory as the source for a jar, then, in a stack trace, when I click the named file containing a method I wish to view, IntelliJ asks me to choose between two of the same file, presumably because it knows about the source its in a module in my project and its also been told about the source via the jar source path I added.p  pI tried adding the provider.jar to the project module dependencies tab, which caused intellij no end of grief.  Reverted back to having it in jrelibext, and, in the Platform SettingsSDKs1.8Sourcepath tab, I added the module sourcepath.  This lets intellij step into the .java file for the jar, vs the .class file, but, when it does so, I now get a banner at the top of my code windows which says Alternative source available for the class xxx and theres a combobox at the RHS with the module name listed twice in the latest EAP, it actually lists the module and the jar [same name as module, with .jar].  And, as mentioned earlier, the IDE asks which which of the very same file I wish to edit when I click a file in the stack trace.p  pClearly, there is something not quite right.. what am I missing  I find it odd that the ide will not open the source code when stepping into the jar until I attach the code as above, but, when I do, it sees it twice.p
Positive 277 pHow can Ip  ol liSet a breakpoint.li liStop on Breakpoint.li liRelease, but leave in debug mode. By release, I mean dont step to next line. Jump to next breakpoint.

So far the only thing I have been able to do is just kill the debug session.  Where is the RELEASE button to just move on p  pI mean to me this is just obvious.

Positive 277 pI am trying to debug a simple DropWizard application in Eclipse, in an attempt to familiarise myself with it. I can start the jvm from the command line like thisp  precodejava Xdebug agentlibjdwptransportdtsocket,address9999,servery,suspendn jar dropwizard0.0.1SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yaml codepre  pAnd then connect to it as a remote java app.p  pOr I can find the application class containing the main method in eclipse and launch the application in debug that way. Both these methods appear to successfully start the application in debug, and sure enough, if I set a break point somewhere, it gets hit.p  pMy problem, however, is that Eclipse would normally at this point give me some control over the application but in this case is rather oddly not allowing me to resume, or use any step commands. I cant do anything other than terminate the application.p  pPerhaps I am having a stupid morning, but I cannot fathom why this is happening.  Can anyone shed any light on this and how I can gain the control required to debugp

Positive 277 pI would like to program in threading building blocks with tasks. But how does one do the debugging in practicep  pIn general the print method is a solid technique for debugging programs.  In my experience with MPI parallelization, the right way to do logging is that each thread print its debugging information in its own file say debugirank with irank the rank in the MPICOMMWORLD so that the logical errors can be found.p  pHow can something similar be achieved with TBB It is not clear how to access the thread number in the thread pool as this is obviously something internal to tbb.p  pAlternatively, one could add an additional index specifying the rank when a task is generated but this makes the code rather complicated since the whole program has to take care of that.p

Negative 277 pIm looking for a way to obtain offsets of data members of a C class which is of nonPOD nature.p  pHeres why p  pId like to store data in a hrefhttpwww.hdfgroup.orgHDF5whatishdf5.htmlHDF5a format, which seems most suited for my kind of material numerical simulation output, but it is perhaps a rather Coriented library. I want to use it through the C interface, which would require me to declare storage types like so following documentation from a hrefhttpwww.hdfgroup.orgHDF5doc1.6cpplusRMclassH511CompType.htmla16herea and a hrefhttpwww.hdfgroup.orgHDF5doc1.6UG11Datatypes.htmlherea section 4.3.2.1.1 p  precodeclass example   public     double membera     int memberb  class example  H5CompType functhatcreatesexampleCompType      H5CompType ct     ct.insertMembera, HOFFSETexample, membera, H5PredTypeNATIVEDOUBLE     ct.insertMemberb, HOFFSETexample, memberb, H5PredTypeNATIVEINT     return ct  functhatcreatesexampleCompType codepre  pwhere HOFFSET is a HDFspecific macro that uses offsetof.p  pThe problem is of course, that as soon as the exampleclass becomes it little bit more featureful, it is no longer of PODtype, and so using offsetof will give undefined results.p  pThe only workaround I can think of is to first export the data I want to store to a simpler struct, then pass that to HDF. That does however involve data copying, which is exactly what HDF is trying to avoid and why they have this CompType which enables the library to reach into your objects to save their data to file.p  pSo I was hoping youd have better ideas. Ideally Id be looking for a portable workaround for this problem, but if short of that you could give me an idea that works on x86 and x8664 with GCC Id already be immensely grateful.p  p appended later p  pGreg Hewgill suggested below to store the data in a simple struct, then build the actual class by inheriting from that. For HDF specifically, I think that may not practically work. A more elaborate usage scenario than abovep  precodeclass basepod  public     double membera     int memberb  class basepod  class derivednonpod  private basepod  public     the following method is only virtual to illustrate the problem     virtual double getmembera return membera   class derivednonpod  class thatusesderivednonpod  public     void whatever private     derivednonpod memberc  class thatusesderivednonpod codepre  pNow, when were storing instances of the class thatusesderivednonpod, we cannot describe its memory layout as if it had a basepod as memberc. This would get the offsets wrong because derivednonpod adds funky stuff like a virtual function table, I guess.p
Negative 277 pI have over the course of a few projects developed a pattern for creating immutable readonly objects and immutable object graphs. Immutable objects carry the benefit of being 100 thread safe and can therefore be reused across threads. In my work I very often use this pattern in Web applications for configuration settings and other objects that I load and cache in memory. Cached objects should always be immutable as you want to guarantee they are not unexpectedly changed.p  pNow, you can of course easily design immutable objects as in the following examplep  precodepublic class SampleElement    private Guid id   private string name    public SampleElementGuid id, string name        this.id  id     this.name  name       public Guid Id        get  return id        public string Name        get  return name      codepre  pThis is fine for simple classes  but for more complex classes I do not fancy the concept of passing all values through a constructor. Having setters on the properties is more desirable and your code constructing a new object gets easier to read. p  pSo how do you create immutable objects with settersp  pWell, in my pattern objects start out as being fully mutable until you freeze them with a single method call. Once an object is frozen it will stay immutable forever  it cannot be turned into a mutable object again. If you need a mutable version of the object, you simply clone it.p  pOk, now on to some code. I have in the following code snippets tried to boil the pattern down to its simplest form. The IElement is the base interface that all immutable objects must ultimately implement. p  precodepublic interface IElement  ICloneable    bool IsReadOnly  get    void MakeReadOnly  codepre  pThe Element class is the default implementation of the IElement interfacep  precodepublic abstract class Element  IElement    private bool immutable    public bool IsReadOnly        get  return immutable        public virtual void MakeReadOnly        immutable  true       protected virtual void FailIfImmutable        if immutable throw new ImmutableElementExceptionthis       ...  codepre  pLets refactor the SampleElement class above to implement the immutable object patternp  precodepublic class SampleElement  Element    private Guid id   private string name    public SampleElement     public Guid Id        get              return id           set            FailIfImmutable       id  value            public string Name        get              return name           set            FailIfImmutable       name  value          codepre  pYou can now change the Id property and the Name property as long as the object has not been marked as immutable by calling the MakeReadOnly method. Once it is immutable, calling a setter will yield an ImmutableElementException.p  pFinal note The full pattern is more complex than the code snippets shown here. It also contains support for collections of immutable objects and complete object graphs of immutable object graphs. The full pattern enables you to turn an entire object graph immutable by calling the MakeReadOnly method on the outermost object. Once you start creating larger object models using this pattern the risk of leaky objects increases. A leaky object is an object that fails to call the FailIfImmutable method before making a change to the object. To test for leaks I have also developed a generic leak detector class for use in unit tests. It uses reflection to test if all properties and methods throw the ImmutableElementException in the immutable state.  In other words TDD is used here.p  pI have grown to like this pattern a lot and find great benefits in it. So what I would like to know is if any of you are using similar patterns If yes, do you know of any good resources that document it I am essentially looking for potential improvements and for any standards that might already exist on this topic.p

So I tried to use the  operator likep  precodemyObject.SomeEvent  new EventHandler BaseClass.SomeEventHandler codepre  pat which point the compiler complainer that it had no access to the private method SomeEventHandler. Since the base class was a part of the library I did not really want to modify its implementation though simply as it seems by just turning private into protectedp  pIts so simple to attach an event handler to an event. Why is it so difficult to get rid of onep  pWhy I wanted it Because the base implementation was casing some problems just did not handle our particular case so I wanted to redefine it. But even after I attached my event handler the base implementation was getting executed anyway. Since it was doing some kind of Redirect, my own implementation was never going to run since the request processing was being broken at server after redirect.p  pIs there anyway to get rid of an event handler in a base class from a library without modifying its implementationp

Negative 277 pIm building an ASP.Net website. I have a cart class which stores the items in the users cart. I dont want to re query the database every time the page reloads to populate the cart items stored in this object. Is the best way to storepersist instantiated objects by putting them in a session and store the session to a database were on SQL Server 2k8 It seems like thats what most are recommending from reading other posts on StackOverflow. Our site has a pretty high amount of traffic, so its easy to imagine 1000s of these objects being active at any given time.p  pIm new to building ASP.Net websites. Is it common practice to persist user objects not just simple variables in a session or cookie, but class objects... also along the lines of persistent objects, I plan on creating a static class which stores commonly used sitewide data such as a List of U.S. states... are there any pitfalls with doing this I dont want to shoot myself in the foot.p  pUpdate p  pWe are in a farm environment so storing sessions in a daatabase seems out of the question... if one server goes down we roll over to another... in which case the session data may be lost. We were considering using a separate server for storing sessions, which would work in our farm environment but Im iffy about storing that many instantiated objects in memory.p
Negative 277 pThe application has a CPU intensive long process that currently runs on one server an EJB method serially when the client requests it.p  pIts theoretically possible from a conceptual point of view to split that process in N chunks and execute them in parallel, as long as the output of all parallel jobs can be collected and joined together before  sending it back to the client that initiated the process. Id like to use this parallelization to optimize performance.p  pHow can I implement this parallelization with EJBs I know that we should not create threads in a EJB method. Instead, we should publish messages one per job to be consumed by message driven beans MDBs. But then it would not be a synchronous call anymore.

Negative 277 pFor a system I am currently building, the following two scenarios occurp  ol lipMy permissions system is the perennial favorite of attaching permissions to roles, and roles to users, but with a twist permissions may be applied to any asset at any tier, and there are 4 Tiers, numbered 0 through 3.  As such, the role assignment table is 5 fields long asset tier, asset ID, role ID, user ID, and a flag for disabled.  This TierID system is also used in assigning users to a Home Asset.p  pThe unfortunate side effect of this system is that it is generally far simpler to resolve my these asset references in the application itself, instead of in the SQL I know it would be possible to do, but it would result in some seriously ugly queries.  strongIs there a better way to represent this sort of relationship  Is this an acceptable way of representing this relationshipstrongp  pSide note the tables for the assets themselves they are hierarchal are normalized, with foreign key references pointing from child to parent e.g. Tier 3 contains info about Tier 2, etc, so once a single asset is pinned down it is very simple to locate its children and ancestors.pli lipSimilar problem, but different data context At the lowest tier, devices can be attached.  Devices are also allowed to be placed onto a graphical representation like a map, and their arrangement information is stored in the database.  Graphical references also called points should point at a real device, but a real device may not point at a graphical reference.p  pAt present, there is a single reference table to all points which represent devices with information for their display layout, location, size, etc.  I can identify three possible things to do from herep  ol liCreate a series of normalized tables to represent individual devices, and use a similar device type  device ID system to look them up, and store this information in the points table this will still require the application to do intermediary work in resolving those references to actual devices in their respective tablesli liCreate a series of normalized tables, and point them at the points table this solution probably wont require the application to dereference the points data, but will require that all device tables be scanned for any Tier 3 object.li liUsing the points table as a guideline, add all of the relevant display data to each respective normalized table.  While this would prevent having to resolve any lookups at all, it will still require that I scan every device table, and is also extremely intolerant to any changes in how the points data must be stored compared to the other solutions.li ol  pstrongIs this problem already solved and I just didnt get the memo  Is there a standard design addressing this problem, or should I just assume that I will have to resolve these references myselfstrongpli ol  pNote With respect to problem two, I have deemed the following two solutions to be horrible and I will not consider them barring some crazy, amazing evidence that it is the best way, which Im fairly sure it isntp  ol liStore all the information about each device in a serialized array or some such mechanism in the points table itself. emThis has the obvious problem of being completely unsearchable and defying normal formemli liStore all devices in a single, generic table. emUnfortunately, these devices are all extremely different in the type of data they provide, as well as how they must be accessed, and doing so in one table would require, last time I tried working it out on paper, at least 30 and probably more columns, more than half of which would be null for every row.emli ol  pAny solutions are requested and appreciated, though I am specifically looking for existing patterns andor normalized schemas which address this issue, if any exist.  If you know for a fact that it is the correct answer, No will suffice and I will continue to use the application layer to resolve these references. It has not been a problem yet, I just prefer to know Im not forging a path in the wrong direction when someone has already solved thisthese problems.

Negative 277 pI am writing some code for handling data. There are a number of groups of processing functions that can be chosen by the user that are then applied to the dataset. I would like to implement all these groups in separate places, but since they all take the same parameters and all do similar things I would like for them to have a common interface.p  pBeing a good little c programmer my first thought was to simply use polymorphism. Just create some abstract class with the desired interface and then derive each set of processing objects from that. My hopes were quickly dashed however when I thought of another wrinkle. These datasets are enormous, resulting in the functions in question being called literally billions of times. While dynamic lookup is fairly cheap, as I understand it, it is a good deal slower than a standard function call.p  pMy current idea to combat this is to use function pointers, in a manner something like thisp  precodevoid dataProcessFunc1mpzclass ampinput... void dataProcessFunc2mpzclass ampinput... ... class DataProcessInterface      ...     void func1mpzclass     void func2mpzclass     ...  codepre  pWith some sort of constructor or something for setting up the pointers to point at the right things.p  pSo I guess my question is this Is this a good method Is there another way Or should I just learn to stop worrying and love the dynamic lookupp

Negative 277 pWeve a stored procedure that happens to build up some dynamic SQL and execute via a parametrised call to codespexecutesqlcode.p  pUnder normal conditions, this works wonderfully, and has made a large benefit in execution times for the procedure 8 seconds to 1 second, however, under some unknown conditions, something strange happens, and performance goes completely the other way 31 seconds, but only when executed via RPC i.e. a call from a .Net app with the codeSqlCommand.CommandTypecode of codeCommandType.StoredProcedurecode or as a remote query from a linked server  if executed as a SQL Batch using SQL Server Management Studio, we do not see the degradation in performance.p  pAltering the whitespace in the generated SQL and recompiling the stored procedure, seems  to resolve the issue at least in the short term, but wed like to understand the cause, or ways to force the execution plans to be rebuilt for the generated SQL but at the moment, Im not sure how to proceed with eitherp  hr  pTo illustrate, the Stored Procedure, looks a little likep  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[uspMyObjectSearch]     IsActive       AS BIT  NULL,     IsTemplate     AS BIT  NULL AS DECLARE WhereClause NVARCHARMAX    IF IsActive IS NOT NULL BEGIN     SET WhereClause   AND svc.IsActive  xIsActive  END  IF IsTemplate IS NOT NULL BEGIN     SET WhereClause   AND svc.IsTemplate  xIsTemplate  END  DECLARE Sql NVARCHARMAX       SELECT      svc.[MyObjectId],                 svc.[Name],                 svc.[IsActive],                 svc.[IsTemplate]      FROM        dbo.MyObject    svc WITH NOLOCK      WHERE  11   WhereClause        ORDER BY    svc.[Name] Asc  EXEC spexecutesql Sql, NxIsActive BIT, xIsTemplate BIT,                    xIsActive  IsActive, xIsTemplate  IsTemplate codepre  pWith this approach, the query plan will be cached for the permutations of NULLnotNULL, and were getting the benefit of cached query plans. What I dont understand is why it would use a different query plan when executed remotely vs. locally after something happens I also dont understand what the something might bep  pI realise I emcouldem move away from parametrisation, but then wed lose the benefit of caching what are emnormallyem good execution plans.p

Negative 277 pI am currently working on creating a scalable server design in C for a ubuntu server.

Its going to be TCP based. The thing is for linux making a server be multi client seems to mean creating a new process per client or selecting through a fdset of connected clients. I want to combine these approaches and have a manager process that will select through maybe 100 clients and report any changes up the chain to a taskmaster process which will then distribute the change to the other manager processes. This will work fine with piping if the managers and taskmasters are on the same box, but if I want to scale it later I need a speedy interLan communication method.p
Negative 277 pI have been working on a course project in which we implemented an FPS using FSMs, by showing a top 2d view of the game, and using the bots and players and circles.

Negative 277 pIf you visit a page that does not exist, and a 404 is thrown and Grails goes to try to render my custom 404 error page, I get lazy initialization errors from some taglibs I have that are executed in the error layout.p  pThe taglib does in fact try to access a domain object inside of another domain object that is a hasmany relationship.  It is able to get the initial object, but when accessing the relationship, it throws this lazy initialization error.p  pHowever, this does not happen when any other page is accessed properly. Even if I try to access my custom error page directly.  Only when a 404 error is thrown.  p  pIs there something different about the hibernate session during this time that causes the lazy initialization error  p  pIs it possible that accessing something that is lazily initialized in a taglib is not a good idea in Grailsp

Negative 277 pI have an iPhone  iOS application in which there exist UIButtons plain, with text labels no custom graphics used which, when pressed, push a new UIViewController onto the UINavigationController stack.p  pThe buttons appear indirectly on a UIScrollView they are all directly on another UIView, which is constructed at runtime, and then this UIView is added to the UIScrollView.p  pThe problem when a user presses one of these buttons, in most instances, the button does not show as highlighted, although the correct action is taken the proper view controller is pushed onto the stack.p  pIf I set the press detection to use TouchUpInside rather than TouchDown, then if the user holds the button pressed down for a short time half a second, perhaps the button shows as highlighted, but using TouchDown it is rarely highlighted, and in any event, I would prefer that the highlight shows up even if the user just lightly taps the button.p  pIve researched this site and others for answers, and tried the various approaches that I found suggested for combating similar issues..  The most likely answer seemed to be setting the delaysContentTouches property to NO for the UIScrollView, but this made no discernable difference in my application.  Indeed, nothing that I found satisfactorily answered the question.p  pAny ideas...p

Negative 277 pOn most operating systems today, the default is that when we install a program, it is given access to many resources that it may not need, and its user may not intend to give it access to. For example, when one installs a closed source program, in principle there is nothing to stop it from reading the private keys in code.sshcode and send them to a malicious third party over the internet, and unless the user is a security expert proficient in using tracing programs, he will likely not be able to detect such a breach.p  pWith the proliferation of many closed sourced programs being installed on computers, what actions are different operating systems taking to solve the problem of sandboxing third party programs p  pAre there any operating system designed from the grounds up with security in mind, where every program or executable has to declare in a clearly readable format by the user what resources it requires to run, so that the OS runs it in a sandbox where it has access only to those resources For example, an executable will have to declare that it will require access to a certain directory or a file on the filesystem, that it will have to reach certain domains or IP address over the network, that it will require certain amount of memory, etc ... If the executable lies in its declaration for system resource requirements, it should be prevented from accessing them by the operating system. p

I have read that you cant read a directory on a remote server, which makes sense.p  pIs my best bet to place a file into the remote servers image directory that outputs all of the image file names so I can parse it with the other server Is there an easier wayp  pI prefer not to use FTP httpphp.netmanualenbook.ftp.php.p  pWhat are my options for basically just getting the names of the images in that folderp  pThanks, Ryanp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4902985optionsforreadingaremotedirectory49030654903065marios answera is lightweight and works like a charm. It is exactly the solution I thought I wanted, but after thinking about it some more, and reading that even mario would do it differently, I decided to go with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4902985optionsforreadingaremotedirectory49030254903025bensius answera, because to me, control and security are more important than convenience. With marios method, its very hard to know if the data youre getting is any good lack of control and youre exposing your directory  some server information security. bensius suggestion involves a second file inconvenience, but provides the control and security Im ultimately deciding to go withp  pThank you bothp  pRyanp

Negative 277 pI have an Activity with a viewFlipper and a slidingDrawer. The SlidingDrawers Handler contains an extra button wich is clickable.p  pThe problem is, the extra button on the handler only registers onClick when the slidingDrawer is locked, and when the slidingDrawer is locked, the viewFlipper the rest of the layout does not respond to the gestureListener anymore and therefore I cannot flip between views.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to make an extra button on a slidingDrawers handler clickable and at the same time have a working gesturelistener on the viewFlipperp  pMaybe someone knows why slidingDrawer.lock would block the touch input for the rest of the layoutp  pThanksp

Negative 277 pI have been trying to follow the few tutorials on how to create a DB using the model first approach in MVC. I have gone as far as creating Entities in the designer and trying to generate a DB from the model. It creates SQL file fine but I cant seem to execute it I have no option to do so When I right click the file the execute option is not available and when I open the file and right click in the context the option is not available. I have tried connecting to a blank DB and then creating the Entity Model on this DB with model entities and then trying to generate a DB from the model but still no option to execute the sql from within VS2010 express.  Is there a reason why its not there p  pQuestion 2 I like using the model first approach as I find the graphical representation of all the entities and their relationships easy to understand and I like the fact all the C Db access classes get created at a click of a button. However most examples  for MVC 3 seem to use the code first approach. are there big benefits in using code first over model first which approach is easier to grasp  I come from DB background and when i did do some asp coding way back, DBs were always in place first p

Negative 277 pSo the other day, I was looking through some old C books and noticed a way of creating a C class I had never seen before.  Everything I have seen up to that point had always used the include header.h and compiled the implementation files separately.  What I saw the author of this book do is actually put an include directive to the implementation at the end of the header file and omitting the .cpp file from the compilation.  Has anybody used this style p  pFor Example I have main.cpp employee.h employee.cppp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstringgt include employee.h void main some code    employee.h ifndef EMPLOYEEH define EMPLOYEEH class employee     public    public members    private    private members  endif  employee.cpp include employee.h include ltstringgt public member definitions codepre  pI would normaly compile this project like sop  precodeg main.cpp employee.cpp codepre  pBut in the authors example is like thisp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstringgt include employee.h void main some code    employee.h ifndef EMPLOYEEH define EMPLOYEEH class employee     public    public members    private    private members  include employee.cpp   lt the line of code that caught my attention endif  employee.cpp  include ltstringgt public member definitions codepre  pAnd the resulting code compiles asp  precodeg main.cpp codepre  pIs this merely a style preference or are there any real benefits in this  I would think it wouldnt scale very well, but I am not a super proficient C programmer either.p

Why is the latter faster than calling String.format I would expect the object concatenation generate more intermediate objects and in general trash performance, but Ive found exactly the opposite.

Leave requests, contracts, or you name it.  This has been a big improvement in terms of routing for approval.  However, we are in a situation now where we enter all of this data twice  once into a database for administrative use, and then a second time into the form for approval.  What Id like to do, is have someone enter the data into our database as they already do via asp.net applications Ive built, and then when theyre ready, click a button that ports that data over to the online approval form.p  pBTW  the online approval form process is managed by a different department, and they are not willing to modify their process in any way. So any solution to this has to start from my side of the house.

Negative 277 pIm at an early stage of development and experience as a programmer.  I would really appreciate some advice and insight.  I am developing an application on the Android platform that should allow users to record short 510 second audio files and store them on a remote database.  It should also allow any user to later locate and playback the sound file from any phone running the application.  br I have looked a little into storing them as blobs in a SQLite db, but I read that the speed of the database begins suffering at just 250bytes per row.  The files wont be huge but they will exceed this amount sufficiently to dissuade me from going headlong down this path.  There will be some basic information attached to each file.  Unless someone has a better idea, I will probably use the SQLite db for this alone, and include some sort of a pointer to the audio data.  What would be the most appropriate way to store the audio information br Again I really appreciate any advice or insight into this issue. br Thanks, br Adam p
Negative 277 pIm a JS and jQuery newb so please bear with me. Ive got this script working somewhat but it doesnt do exactly what I want it to do and I cant figure it out. The basic idea is that I click a link and it opens a div using slideToggle. The tricky part is closing a previously opened div before opening a new one, the best that Ive been able to do is to hide the previous div. Trying to toggle the previous div has not worked presumably because Im not targeting the div specifically but rather telling it to close all divs before opening the new one. Another issue Ive run into is links on the same page seem to become disabled, this appears to be due to the return false command however I dont know how to keep the page from scrolling to the top when I click the slide link if I dont use that command.

Negative 277 pIm new to EJB, and theres something about resource injection that has been bugging me for a while. I guess this is a pretty basic concept, but I couldnt figure it out on my own. And people say that theres no dumb question so here it goesp  pWhat I dont understand is the difference between Package Import and Resource Injection. The difference I refer is not about usage they sure are used in different way, but about meaning. Why doesnt EJB use package import instead of resource injectionp  pFor example I have a stronggetInfoBeanstrong that implements interface stronggetInfostrong. To use this bean in a client, I can lookup in JNDI or DI with EJB if clients deployed in ACC. In either way, I need to specify the name getInfo. So while doesnt EJB let strongimportstrong handle this Isnt the purpose of strongimportstrong is to specify some name so it can make the program aware of the class or interface that itd like to usep  pThanksp

Negative 277 pIve got a classified listing website for cars which Im in the process of developing built in PHP.

When they click submit they are taken through to the results page, and this is where Im having problems. p  pThe way it is setup at the moment isp  ol liThe database is queried for any results matching the car they are looking for. The query returns the ID of the car and the Postcode of the advert li liEach advert is then checked for the distance between the users postcode and the postcode of the advert. This itself requires a database query to find the coordinates for individual postcodes of each advert and is quite time consuming for what can be in excess of 350 results at timesli liAn if statement is then used to determine if the distance is less than or equal to the distance the user entered on the homepageli liIf the advert is within the allowed distance its ID is added to an arrayli liThe total number of adverts in the array is then calculated and used to determine a variable dependant on the number of adverts and the number of adverts to be displayed on the pageli liA second query of the advert table is then executed using a codeWHEREcode statement and the IDs in the array. e.g. codeSELECT  FROM adverts WHERE ID1 AND ID4 AND ID23code ........ The total number of IDs used in the query depend on the variable mentioned in point 5. When the user then clicks next page the query is rerun from the position in the array that it was left at and the query is then recreated and executed.li ol  pThe problem Im having is that it is taking ages to complete and I was looking for a more resource and time concious way of completing it. p  pIt originally was designed that a query would execute with WHERE clauses for each of the users specific requirements for the car, and then before being output to the page the distance was being checked using an if statement. This caused problems with the page numbering because it was impossible to determine the number of adverts that would match the distance requirements from the adverts returned in the query hence it is done this way with the distance conditions being satisfied before the full adverts are collected so an exact number of adverts to be displayed is calculated.p  pSorry its a little long  hope it makes sense. I havent included any code because it would make it longer, and its a problem with the logic as opposed to the actual code. p  pThanks for any suggestions you are able to make.p  pSomeone has requested the table layout and SQL.

Negative 277 pThanks in advancep  pI have a simple mysql and php blog that I built based on a tutorial I found online.  What I would like to be able to do, but have no idea how to go about it, is thisp  pI would like a picture avatar to be displayed with each comment on each post.  The picture that is chosen would be based off of the name in the Posted By area of the comment.  So for instance Lets say me, the admin, leaves a comment on the thread.  My name is automatically pulled in via a SESSION variable so I dont have to worry about entering that each time.  When the comment is displayed on the blog thread page, it shows Commented on By Admin.  This name is stored in the db and pulled in with the a php echo statement.  p  pSo what I want this avatar code to be able to do is  1 look at the area where the Commented on By text is  2 read the text  3 see that it says Admin and display the admin.png image next to it.  If it sees anything other than Admin in the Commented on By area, then it will display something like guest.pngp  pHere is a snippet of code I found in my stackoverflow and google searches.  It works but it pulls in the guest image 6 times, then the actual admin.png image, and then the guest image 3 more times.  And it displays this way on EACH comment on EACH thread  And when I add a new thread and a new comment to that thread, it adds the guest image again at the end of the multiple images being displayed on each comment.

Negative 277 pWe are designing an application where users can set multiple tasks running simultaneously.  We use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem to set the tasks running. That part runs well.p  pWe do have a problem where these tasks can consume 500MB of memory.  We are using memorymapped IO to manage the memory.  Still when users set 10 tasks running simultaneously, the threadpool will start all of them and there have been times that we run out of memory and exceptions occur.  We can handle the errors just fine.p  pWhat I am wondering is if there is a way to take the memory that will be consumed into account when processing the queue, i.e. keeping tasks queued until sufficient memory exists  Can I inform the threadpool about how much memory we will be asking for which we can roughly estimate p

Negative 277 pI know Stackoverflow doesnt want discussions, so I will try to ask an answerable question here basically, I am building a admin area with naught but a table that has a few columns like project name, due date, sort of normal stuff. p  pBut is there a technique that allows nonpolling updating of when attributes changes in the server, it gets reflected on the users loaded page p  pThe tables data comes from a JSON call to the server, and it gets rendered with some javascript onto the table. Real simple stuff. If you must ask for an example. sure, just a table of first and last names. p  precodeHomer  Simpson Lisa   Simpson Bart   Simpson codepre  pThis page is opened on many of our users, then if I change Homer to Remoh, without having the user refresh the page, I want the updated name be, well, updated on the table display. p  pDoes Websocket or the pubsub pattern have something to do with thisp  pThank youp

Negative 277 pSo theres a ton of cases where this it needed in performance sensitive applications, and Im finally at the straw that broke the camels back.

Negative 277 pWith Symfony2 Im trying to set up something like a progress bar showing the progress of a task launched from a form where each row from a textarea needs about 40 seconds to complete an action. Before I get a nice graphical progress bar, I just want to generate a text saying Line 11 of 80, Line 12 of 80, Line 13 of 80, ...p  pAt the moment, Ive done something with two ajax scripts. The first one send the form to the PHP script that update a temp file with the current line number. The second one pings this file via another simple PHP script to know the progress status.p  pEach ajax request is working good on its own side but I cant get them working together  for instance, as soon as the ajax script sends the form, the pinging one stops and I lost the progress status.p  pI can post some code if needed. But now Im particularly wondering if what I want as a chance to work. Maybe its simply impossible, or maybe I should do it in another way.p

Negative 277 pI have two questions. First Im trying to make it where whenever the iPhone moves in location at all, an alert box pops up and shows the longitude where they were, and the latitude where they are now. This is for testing purposes for part of a bigger project Im working on. Problem is, no alert box is popping up at all. I thought that when the location manager gets a new location, it fires up the delegate which should show the location in an alert box, however nothing is happening at all. p  pHere is how Im setting up the Location Managerp  precode     voidviewDidLoad      locationManager [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]     locationManager.delegate  self      locationManager.desiredAccuracy  kCLLocationAccuracyBest     locationManager.distanceFilter  kCLDistanceFilterNone     [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]  codepre  pHere is the delegatep  precode    void locationmanager CLLocationManager  manager         didUpdateToLocation CLLocation  newLocation         fromLocation CLLocation  oldLocation        float oldlat      float oldlng     float lat     float lng     NSDate oldtime     NSDate newtime      lat  newLocation.coordinate.latitude     lng  newLocation.coordinate.longitude     newtime  newLocation.timestamp     oldlat  oldLocation.coordinate.latitude     oldlng  oldLocation.coordinate.longitude         oldtime  oldLocation.timestamp      NSNumber oldlong  [NSNumber numberWithFloatoldlng]     NSNumber newlat  [NSNumber numberWithFloatlat]       UIAlertView alert  [[UIAlertView alloc]                           initWithTitleoldlong                           messagenewlat                            delegateself                           cancelButtonTitleCancel                           otherButtonTitlesSubmit,nil]     [alert show] codepre  pSecondly once Im satisfied that Im able to track the new and old latlng, does anybody know the best way to store the data I have researched sqlite, core data, and just using arrays, but im still having doubts as to whats the best way to store the lat, lng, timestamp and username that will be generated probably a couple hundred times a day for around 200 users, and then send it to a server. p  pI know this was a long question, but any insight at all would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 277 pId like to send several chunks of data over the network by simply concatenating them together, and Id like to be able to use a checksum to verify that everything made it over ok this is mainly intended as a defensive check against bugs, not because Ive seen or expect actual lowlevel data corruption.  So Im looking for a checksumming algorithm that will let me calculate the checksum of the whole from the checksums of the parts.  p  pOne simple example of a technique like that that I think would work is to just treat each byte of each chunk as an integer, and add all of those integers together that, of course, wouldnt detect missing zero bytes.  Another would be to just calculate the lengths of each chunk that, of course, wouldnt detect data changes that dont cause net insertions or deletions.  Another, I believe, would be to XOR all the bytes together, but this would only be able to generate 1byte checksums I could take the bytes 4 at a time, and XOR each of those units, but if chunk lengths arent multiples of four, Id have to get into messiness that I think would probably remove the ability to simply concatenate different chunks together.  p  pSo, Im looking for a more serious checksumming or hashing algorithm that still would let me easily calculate the checksum for several concatenated chunks given the checksums of each chunk.

Negative 277 pIm using Djangos builtin User model in one of my projects. Users should be editable, of course. Since its the most convenient solution I started providing the form for User edits by using Djangos own UserChangeForm. UserChangeForm is basically a ModelForm of the UserModel, so it makes it possible to change all the fields of the User model.p  pI dont want users to be able to change every field. So, my first idea was to pass the whole UserChangeForm into the template but render only the fields that I need say username and email. I also want only superusers to be able to change a username, so this field is only rendered if you are a superuser.p  pThe essential code looks like thatp  pstrongview functionstrongp  precodedef edituserrequest, pk     ...    code to ensure not everyone can edit every user     user  User.objects.getpkpk     if request.method  POST         form  UserChangeFormrequest.POST, instanceuser         if form.isvalid             form.save            ...    redirect     else         form  UserChangeForminstanceuser     ...     render template codepre  pstrongform in the templatestrongp  precodeltform action request.path  methodpostgt      csrftoken       if user.issuperuser           form.username       endif       form.email      ltbutton typesubmitgtSaveltbuttongt ltformgt codepre  pNow, my question is How about the security aspects of this solution I do nothing to prevent an attacker to add the e.g. the username field even if he is no superuser. By that, he would populate the POST data with additional data, which is then send to the view function and used to update the User object. That could get really dangerous, since the original UserChangeForm also contains a field issuperuser.p  pI tried the hack the form myself to test my suspicion. I logged in as a normal user, added the username input via the Developer Tools and submitted the form. The result was an exceptionp  precodeTraceback File LibraryPython2.7sitepackagesdjangocorehandlersbase.py in getresponse   111.                         response  callbackrequest, callbackargs, callbackkwargs File LibraryPython2.7sitepackagesdjangocontribauthdecorators.py in wrappedview   20.                 return viewfuncrequest, args, kwargs File UsersjokerDevelopmentwiki2099wiki2099appsaccountsviews.py in edituser   69.             form.save File LibraryPython2.7sitepackagesdjangoformsmodels.py in save   364.                              failmessage, commit, constructFalse File LibraryPython2.7sitepackagesdjangoformsmodels.py in saveinstance   74.                           validate.  opts.objectname, failmessage  Exception Type ValueError at accountsedit12 Exception Value The User could not be changed because the data didnt validate. codepre  pIm not sure if that means that this kind of attack is not possible or that I just didnt do it right.

However if I right click on an item in a listbox which pops up a context menu then the listbox item looses focus and is no longer highlighted.p  pFollowing is some example XAML which demonstrates the behaviour.p  precode    ltWindow xClassWpfApplication1.MainWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         TitleMainWindow Height350 Width525gt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.Resourcesgt             ltContextMenu xKeyContextMenu gt                 ltMenuItem HeaderItem 1 gt                 ltMenuItem HeaderItem 2 gt             ltContextMenugt         ltGrid.Resourcesgt          ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Height20 gt             ltRowDefinition Height100 gt             ltRowDefinition Height gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltMenu Grid.Row0gt             ltMenuItem HeaderFilegt                 ltMenuItem HeaderItem 1 gt                 ltMenuItem HeaderItem 2 gt             ltMenuItemgt         ltMenugt          ltListBox Grid.Row2 ContextMenuStaticResource ResourceKeyContextMenugt             ltListBoxItem ContentList Item 1gt             ltListBoxItem ContentList Item 2gt             ltListBoxItem ContentList Item 3gt             ltListBoxItem ContentList Item 4gt         ltListBoxgt     ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pI have tried setting FocusableFalse on the ContextMenu and MenuItems within the ContextMenu, then I can right click on a ListBoxItem and highlight the MenuItems without the ListBoxItem loosing focus.

So the previous example would return an empty list, but if the substring was changed to The, Walking or Dead, lists of size 1 would be returned with values 0, 4, and 12 respectively. p  pIs this sort of functionality possible to implement using the BoyerMoore algorithm Are there any other string searching algorithms that would be able to produce these results efficientlyp

Negative 277 pI have implemented jQuery drag and drop in my app, and it works everywhere except in IE, and it works there too if the page is smaller than the window no scroll bars. If the page is too long and the draggables are near the bottom, then each drag causes the page to jump back to the top, followed by wild flickering of the content as the item is moved. Has anyone seen this before The code to start the sortable is pretty much a onelinerp  precodejQuerychildrenlist.sortableitemsdiv, updateupdateChildrenOrder codepre  pUPDATE I can eliminate the jerky flickering by setting scrollfalse and setting the height of the container, like thisp  precodejQuerychildrenlist.sortable     items.sortrow,      scroll false,     updateupdateChildrenOrder,     createfunction         jQuerythis.heightjQuerythis.height       codepre  pThe sorting still doesnt work though, because when I begin to drag any element, the dragged element only appears at the very top of the page off screen.p

One server application is very easysimple  its already done  whereas the other is a lot more complicated.p  pThe code is written in a dependency injection style using Guice, if it matters, so it should be extremely easy to break apart.p  pMy question is this how would you structure the projects in Eclipse, using Maven Would you set up three different projects, something likep  precodeservercore serverappEasy serverappComplicated codepre  pwhere each server would have its own pom. Or, would you keep it all in one project I need to be able to easily recompile codeappEasycode in, say, a month from now, while I work on codeappComplicatedcode. The classes for codeappEasycode are already in a subpackage. Note codecorecode would not work by itself without at least a mock dependency injection. It doesnt have a codemaincode class.p  pAll thoughts appreciated, even on things I havent thought of.p

I wont give up on them, I just started reading about them but anyway the solution that I really liked and felt like it fit me was I wrote an html file with all the basic layout that is present in every page and then I just wrote a php script in the main area as it is the part of the page that differs and depending on the GET[] value I includeoncepage.php where that file basically has html code and a little bit of php for some dynamic content that has to do with a database on the server.

Negative 277 pI have not worked on a project of this size before, so please advise if I am taking this the wrong direction.p  pI need to have anywhere from 5 to 700 connections from mobile phones, connecting on the same socket, and transmitting small packets of data to the server CSV strings of only about 20 characters simultaneously.  No data needs to return to the phones, so just need a confirmation of arrival.  The data needs to be crunched and sent to a master device, which Im thinking will use a websocket.p  pI have been an ApacheCGI amp PHP guy for years, but I think Node.js is going to be the way to go to collect the data.  Just a simple IO loop that will capture the data and send a simple acknowledgement.  The heavier number crunching and serving I intend to do using C and PHP.  The issue is collecting the data from the node.js server, and processing it on the Apache server.p  pI was thinking Redis, but Im not very familiar with Redis specifically, so I dont know if there is a FIFO implementation, and I dont need the disk writting since the data will be immediately removed.  I am now thinking memcached, but I still dont know of a FIFO implementation that doesnt rely on using timestamps which might be what I ultimately have to use.p  pAny thoughts or suggestionsp

Negative 277 pPart of our solution is a page that displays companyspecific information using an ASP codeGridviewcode. Our method of constructing the SQL that feeds the codeGridviewcode is by using C to build a custom codeSELECTcode statement based on a series of user inputs. p  pOnce the user applies their filters through a codebutton clickcode, C loops through all of their selections codecheck boxes and text boxescode and then propagates those selections to a separate method which constructs a codeWHEREcode clause to append to a simple codeSELECTcode statement. We use a codeTableValued Function in the FROM statementcode, and the only input parameter is from the codeQuerystringcode and this does not change throughout the process. p  pOnce the query has been assembled using C, we apply this query to the codeSqlDataSourcecode as the codeSelect Commandcode.

Negative 277 pWell, I think the title says it all, but the web page complains that the message body is missing.p  pThere were valuable discussions here about code space optimization, but I wonder what compiler GCC, Keil, IAR, CLang, etc. would do the best job in it. I have compared four so far all free, Atmel Studio GCC, Yagarto, CodeSourcery Light, and ARM GNU Embedded Tools found at launchpad.net. As the source I use part of OpenSSL 1.0.1c configured for no OS and massaged. There is no big difference, about 10 470k to 520k, O1 for the optimization levels I used O1 and Os. I wonder whether there are compilers out there that beat the mainly gcc crowd by 25 or so.p

Negative 277 pI have an application built with ServiceStack and ServiceStack.Razor.  Im having trouble getting error handling configured the way I want.  Here is the goalp  ul liHttpError wStatusCode  401 or 403 should redirect to a Access Denied page.li liHttpError wStatusCode  404 should redirect to a Not found page.li liEverything else should redirect to a generic error page.  We dont want any ServiceStackstyle error messages to be displayed.li ul  pFirst I tried using CustomHttpHandlers for the 401, 403 and 404 errors.  That worked until I set the GlobalHtmlErrorHttpHandler to capture other errors.  What I found was the GlobalHtmlErrorHttpHandler was always hit first and all errors were redirected to the global error page.p  pThen I removed the GlobalHtmlErrorHttpHandler and used AppHost.ServiceExceptionHandler, and that works fine as long as the offending exception is thrown from inside a service.  If an error occurs outside a service we still get the ServiceStack error message.  Also I had to add an escape clause so that 401, 403 and 404 errors are passed through to the appropriate CustomHttpHandler.p  pSo then I set the AppHost.ExceptionHandler to capture everything else.  Heres a snippet from my AppHost.  I feel like I must be missing some way to handle this thats much simpler.

I think I am missing a correct reference here.p  pibsetOnClickListenerbi in the itestAi constructor refers to imyActivityi class and ibthisbi refers to testA class instance.

Despite the name, the index metamethod does   not need to be a function It can be a table, instead. When it is a   function, Lua calls it with the table and the absent key as its   arguments. strongWhen it is a table, Lua redoes the access in that table.strongp blockquote  pMy understanding of this is that in the snippet involving A, codeindex  Acode cause the access to be done in the table codeAcode as per the boldened segmenet of the above quote. If this is the case I dont understand why the function associated with the key codespeakcode isnt found. In an attempt to try fix this, I decided to implement the function approach in the codeBcode snippet, which returns the value associated with codekeycode in codeBcode, and it worked. Surely codeindex  Acode and adapted from codeBcode codeindex  functiont,key return A[key] endcode have the same effect.p  pAny clarification would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 277 pIm having a hard time understanding the big picture of GemStone for Smalltalk. I am aware of GLASS as an application server using Linux, Seaside and Apache. But I want to know if it is an usable environment for nonSeaside applications.p  pIm also having trouble to finding some basic questionsp  pIt is not clear to me if GLASS or GemStoneS is independent of the VM used. For example if Im using a VM which supports black threads, does that mean that the GemStoneS will work transparentlyp  pFor what Ive seen also it is not useful for 3D applications. For example, if my application developed in Pharo or VisualWorks uses OpenGL, may I consider GemStoneS for scaling up p  pIve read that you may have objects in VisualWorks and objects in GemStoneS, but this confuses me a lot. How do I know if the object Ive just created it is already persisted or in client side In which case I need GemBuilderp

Negative 277 pSo far, I have evaluated few well known Java parsers, but none comes actually free for commercial use, in one way or other. Like OpenNLP, which is free, but uses training data which is not available for commercial purpose. Morphadorner is there, but it seems last updated in 2009. Stanford NLP is full GPL, while LingPipe provides a paid license. p  pBeing an nonfunded startup at the moment, it is really not possible for me to pay high license fee.I had to implement a rule based parser for my requirement, which incomparable to industry standard solutions.  p  pThough, I am not a freefreak and it is not like I need something that only few people in world are using. I firmly believe, things like NLP are getting popularity, and implementing a POS Tagger again is like reinventing a reinvented wheel. Is there really no industry standard solution for this p  pUpdate  The mindset seems industrystandard means a paid thing. Then how come several libraries of HTML parsersamong other stuffs come free. Html parsers ar far more used than NLP, but still, there is fairly large requirement for NLP tasks.p  pUpdate  Question is closed. I shall soon be pleased to release my tiny small library for keyword extraction that makes use of Wordnet and various pretty rules.  Thanks AB p

Negative 277 pIm having trouble displaying some of the images in my iOS app. I have changed some of the graphics from PNG to JPG file format and when I removed the PNG images already in the project and added the new JPGs, the simulator was still showing old PNG graphics. I ran clean on the project and reset simulators contents, and now it just does not want to load the images at all  code[UIImage imageNamedfilename]code returns null.p  pOn the other hand, if I save those graphics as PNG, and add them to the project eminsteadem of JPEGs, it loads them fine. But the images are photographic and PNG versions are 78 times larger than JPEG, so Id really want to figure out why it wont load them.p  pEdit after reviewing the documentation for what seems like 100th time, I realized that the mistake was that I did not specify the extension. The Supported Image Formats a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIImageClassReferenceReference.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIImageClassReferenceReference.htmla lists quite a few formats that are supported, and UIImage reference says thatp  blockquote   pOn iOS 4 and later, if the file is in PNG format, it is not necessary to specify the .PNG filename extension.p blockquote  pI misread that to mean that the extension is optional in general, but if the file is not a PNG, you have to include it.

Negative 277 pI want to create a a hrefhttpjqueryui.comsliderrange relnofollowjQuery UI range slidera where the set of values that the upper bound can be set to is different from the set of values that the lower bound can be set to.  Essentially I want a slider where the range of possible values is [a, b] but the two handles leapfrog alternate values, so that the lower handle can only be set to the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., values in the range, and the upper handle can only be set to the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.p  pThe simplest example would be is it possible to create a range slider with values 110 where the lower handle can only be set to odd numbers and the upper handle can only be set to even numbersp  pThe use case is I have a slider for selecting time ranges in years.  The lower bound should represent the beginning of a year and the upper bound the end of a year.  So if you set lower bound to 2012 and upper bound also to 2012, this should mean from beginning of 2012 to end of 2012.p  pI could make a slider with double the range and do some math to compute the underlying range i.e., select 2012 for beginning of 2012 and 2012.5 for end of 2012 but hide this from the user, but the problem is that then the user could set the end to beginning of 2012, which I dont want.  The issue is that I actually want the visual UI to prevent the two handles from occupying the same positions, to prevent someone from choosing a range that is semantically invalid for my purposes.p  pI tried to get clever and use the step option while setting the initial upperlower bounds to staggered values, but this doesnt work.  It seems that the steps are not calculated relative to the current value, but rather the value is snapped to available step positions at each move.  So if you have a 110 slider where the step size is 2 but the upper bound is set to 10, moving it down one will take it to 9, not 8.  This is exactly what I dont want, because I want the two handles to have different, interleaved available values.p  pIm open to solutions that use some widget set other than jQuery UI if thats easier, although Id prefer a solution based on some reputable widget set.  That is, Id rather have something that builds on existing range sliders, not a fromscratch implementation of a slider with this particular feature.p

So this is an idea I had, but the problem is that I dont know how to implement itp  pFirst, I have the number.p  blockquote   p234512p blockquote  pThen I must split it in blocks of numbers that are smaller than 256.p  blockquote   p234,51,2p blockquote  pI could split it if the size was fixed eg, always 3 digits but it may have 1,2 or 3 digits per block, so I got stuck here.p  pAnd after I get blocks of numbers smaller than 256, I will turn them into chars and write to the file.p  pEDIT Since with that method I would lose landing zeros, I created an algorithm that compress 50 of the number sizep  ol lipAs I have only 09 numbers as digits, I could say theyre in hexadecimal although they arent and convert to base 10, reducing its size. EDIT 2 skip this step. Actually, doing it will just increase its sizepli lipI will get a smaller number with 09 numbers as digits, then I could again assume theyre in hexadecimal. Thus, use unhexlify to turn it into a lot of bytes, which are half of the size if its oddlength, add a at the append to the numberpli ol  pThe codep  precodeif leno2 oa avoid oddlength return unhexlifyo codepre  pAnd the return data I can even compress with zlib. Total of 45 compression ratio.p

I dispatch OP1 to the queue handled by sObj on view1 the user fills the rest of the form and press next, push view2, view2 gets the sObj reference and checks if the operation completed, if yes, it fetches the results and display, if not, it goes to a loop checking the property OP1Completed.p  pIf the user is slow when choosing the options, theres a big chance that OP1 will complete before view2 is pushed, which is fine, and works perfectly BUT if the user uses the defaults, theres a 99 chance that he will hit next before OP1 completed, which SHOULD be fine, but its not.p  pChecking logs and debugging I noticed that the async block running on the queue just stops running when view2 is pushed... and because of that OP1Completed flag is never set and then everything else on breaks...p  pcan anyone help im lost herep

Negative 277 pI am using entity framework model first with an entity that is mapped to a view.  The view is in SQL server, but joins with SQL Server and Oracle tables using a linked server.  This has been in place for several months with no issues.p  pstrongI have updated this question.strong  The issue is caused by the Oracle linked server.  As mentioned above, my view joins SQL Server tables and Oracle table using the linked server and OpenQuery.  As a test, I moved all the data to a local table then changed my view to select from this table which takes the linked server out of the process.  Now everything works  I am not getting a No Data Found error.p  pFirst, I use a Linq query to get distinct rows parents.  Then, while iterating, I use a second link query on the original object to get the children of each row.  It is this second Linq query that fails  and it only fails when I access the second row.  When there is a only one row returned it works.  When multiple rows are returned I can access the first row but no more.p  pIs there a problem using linked servers specifically Oracle and Entity Frameworkp  pHere are the detailsp  pThe view represents data related to a collection of files that reside in a batch.  The batch names may be duplicated because we can have more than one file per batch.  Here is an examplebr File1 Batch1br File1 Bacth2br File3 Batch2brp  pI have a modelfirst entity named LatestFileResult that maps to the OracleSqlServer view. brbrbrp  pIn my view model I have a method that gets the distinct batches Batch1, Batch2 for batches that have errors.  Its called BatchErrors in the code sample below.  I start with the LatestFileResult entity with no restrictions.p  pIn my view I successfully iterate though the batches and to show the data.  This works as expected.p  pOn each iteration, I need to get the files that make up this batch and iterate through them.  In the viewModel I have a method called FilesInBatch which takes a batchID and returns the rows with that batchID.  It also starts with the LatestFileResult entity with no restrictions. brbrbrbr In my view, on the first outer iteration everything works as expected.  It calls FilesInBatch which has one row and access the values returned. On the second outer iteration I get an error calling FilesInBatch on the forEach line itself on the assignment  after exiting FilesInBatch.  There should be two items returned but the error occurs getting the file  on the foreach statement.  This only fails when there is more than 1 row.  I can access the first row, but never the second.  The foreeach pulls them all including the second and throws the exception. The error isbr Cannot get the data of the row from the OLE DB provider OraOLEDB.Oracle for linked server OMORACLE.  OLE DB provider OraOLEDB.Oracle for linked server OMORACLE returned message ORA01403 no data found.p  pstrongI know what this means  that is not the question.strong  However, there is data for this query.  This is not an accurate error. In FilesInBatch I have two variables that get a count and they both show a 2 on the call that gives the No data Found error.p  pBoth methods in the ViewModel use the entity framework LatestFileResult object with no restrictions.  p  ul liThere is no way for the batchID I get in the first method not to exist in the second method. li liThe fileInBatch method shows 2 files inside the method  then crashes with No Data Returned in the view.

Can someone point me in the right direction as to how I should handle thisp  pSome clarification Im using MarionetteJS. As per Tumblrs doc Ive added their API in my case a hrefhttpgentletruths.tumblr.comapireadjson relnofollowhttpgentletruths.tumblr.comapireadjsona as a scripttag in my header, effectively bootstrapping it. I process it as a collection, and each post as a model. This collection is then handled by a codeBackbone.Marionette.CompositeViewcode, and each model by a codeBackbone.Marionette.ItemViewcode. So in my codeItemViewcode template below the codeidcode works as a reference, but the codephotourl100code doesnt.p  precodeltscript idinstagramitemtemplate typetexttemplategt     lta href classphotosframegt         ltspan classcaptiongtlt id gtltspangt         ltimg srclt photourl100 gt alt classphotosphotogt     ltagt ltscriptgt codepre  pIve consulted Marionettes annotated source render function here a hrefhttpmarionettejs.comdocsbackbone.marionette.htmlsection188 relnofollowhttpmarionettejs.comdocsbackbone.marionette.htmlsection188a, but Im not sure how to properly read this and deduce how the data is made available.p

Negative 277 pI encountered an odd situation where appending codeOPTION RECOMPILEcode to my query causes it to run in half a second, while omitting it causes the query to take well over five minutes.p  pThis is the case when the query is executed from Query Analyzer or from my C program via codeSqlCommand.ExecuteReadercode. Calling or not calling codeDBCC FREEPROCCACHEcode or codeDBCC dropcleanbufferscode makes no difference Query results are always returned instantaneously with codeOPTION RECOMPILEcode and greater than five minutes without it. The query is always called with the same parameters [for the sake of this test].p  pIm using SQL Server 2008.p  pIm fairly comfortable with writing SQL but have never used an codeOPTIONcode command in a query before and was unfamiliar with the whole concept of plan caches until scanning the posts on this forum. My understanding from the posts is that codeOPTION RECOMPILEcode is an expensive operation. It apparently creates a new lookup strategy for the query. So why is it then, that subsequent queries that omit the codeOPTION RECOMPILEcode are so slow Shouldnt the subsequent queries be making use of the lookup strategy that was computed on the previous call which included the recompilation hintp  pIs it highly unusual to have a query that requires a recompilation hint on every single callp  pSorry for the entrylevel question but I cant really make heads or tails of this.p  pstrongUPDATE Ive been asked to post the query...strongp  precodeselect acctNo,mindate earliestDate  from      select acctNo,tradeDate as date      from datafeedtrans      where feedidfeedID and feedDatefeedDate       union       select acctNo,feedDate as date      from datafeedmoney      where feedidfeedID and feedDatefeedDate       union       select acctNo,feedDate as date      from datafeedjnl      where feedidfeedID and feedDatefeedDate  t1  group by t1.acctNo OPTIONRECOMPILE codepre  pWhen running the test from Query Analyzer, I prepend the following linesp  precodedeclare feedID int select feedID20  declare feedDate datetime select feedDate122009 codepre  pWhen calling it from my C program, the parameters are passed in via the codeSqlCommand.Parameterscode property.p  pFor the purposes of this discussion, you can assume that the parameters never change so we can rule out suboptimal parameter smelling as the cause.p

Negative 277 pThis is more of a conceptual question rather than a practical one. Im just starting to learn the MVVM concept for developing UI , and Ive come across a dillema Im not sure the answer to brbr Say I have a main window and a little popup window meaning its a small window with some UI elements in it.

What is the correct way of doing so The way I see it I cant do something like this p  precodePopUpWindow pop  new PopUpWindow codepre  pBecause it kind of defeats the purpose of abstracting the view from the view modelWhat if a year from now ill want to create a better version of the PopUpWindow using the same PopUpWindowViewModel. On the other hand , I cant initialize a new instnace of the PopUpWindow using just its view model The viewModel as I understand is not supposed to know anything about the view that will use it.p  pHope it all makes sense... so what would you do in that situationp  pJust to clarify it further , lets say for arguments sake that the situation Im describing is a button on the MainWindowView that upon clicking will open a PopUpWindowView.p  pThanks in advnace.p

Negative 277 pAll,p  pI have a section of a form where the user can add elements dynamically. They are able to add rows containing 3 input fields at a time. Note that I am not binding these dynamic elements to the model  I will handle in the HTTP POST processing controller.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com90LFN.png altenter image description herep  pEach added row represents a emCosponsorem object that will need to be created in the form processing controller action for the HTTP POST and then inserted into the database.p  pI was wondering what is the best way to name these elements so I can easily create the objects in the processing controllerp  pCurrently, the elements are being named like thisp  precodecosponsorcontact1 cosponsoremail1 cosponsorphone1  cosponsorcontact2 cosponsoremail2 cosponsorphone2  cosponsorcontact4 cosponsoremail4 cosponsorphone4  cosponsorcontactn cosponsoremailn cosponsorphonen codepre  pThis will involve a lot of regexing and looping to put these back together and thus create the objects. I am assuming that these elements may be in the Request.Form collection in a random order and that we may not have sequential numbering of the ids as shown in the example above.p  pI can certainly do it that way but I am sure that there has to be an easier way, perhaps in the naming convention of the form elementsp  pstrongHere is a snippet of the generated form contentstrongp  precodeltdiv idcosponsors6 styledisplay blockgt     ltlabelgtSponsor club nameltlabelgtltspangt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor contact placeholderName namecosponsorcontact6 idcosponsorcontact6gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor email placeholderEmail namecosponsoremail6 idcosponsoremail6gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor phone placeholderPhone namecosponsorphone6 idcosponsorphone6gtlta classicon deletegtltagt ltdivgt ltdiv idcosponsors7 styledisplay blockgt     ltlabelgtSponsor club nameltlabelgtltspangt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor contact placeholderName namecosponsorcontact7 idcosponsorcontact7gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor email placeholderEmail namecosponsoremail7 idcosponsoremail7gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor phone placeholderPhone namecosponsorphone7 idcosponsorphone7gtlta classicon deletegtltagtlt ltdivgt ltdiv idcosponsors8 styledisplay blockgt     ltlabelgtSponsor club nameltlabelgtltspangt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor contact placeholderName namecosponsorcontact8 idcosponsorcontact8gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor email placeholderEmail namecosponsoremail8 idcosponsoremail8gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor phone placeholderPhone namecosponsorphone8 idcosponsorphone8gtlta classicon deletegtltagt ltdivgt ltdiv idcosponsors9 styledisplay blockgt     ltlabelgtSponsor club nameltlabelgtltspangt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor contact placeholderName namecosponsorcontact9 idcosponsorcontact9gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor email placeholderEmail namecosponsoremail9 idcosponsoremail9gt     ltinput typetext titleCosponsor phone placeholderPhone namecosponsorphone9 idcosponsorphone9gtlta classicon deletegtltagt ltdivgt codepre
Negative 277 pI requested to buy a hrefhttpwww.sublimetext.com relnofollowSublime text editora in my office for commercial use.

But He want some perfect reason to buy. p  pAnyone can say Why not Eclipse for rails development over Sublime textp  pOne reason I can say Sublime takes very less Memory and run faster than Eclipse.p

Negative 277 pIm trying to write a program in either python or C using opengl that will allow me to control different displays. Currently I have three different displays, I have the computer monitor, a LCD and a DLP all hooked up to my computer.

Negative 277 pOne of the annoying things I have found with .net and NUGet is that I never know what version of anything is installed by default.

Its quite busy, accessing a database on initial load and doing some image processing before displaying to multimonitors.p  pIssuep  pIn most cases the process shuts down cleanly either a on mousekeyboard movement in s mode or when desk.cpl is closed in p mode.  A problem arises thought when I run in p mode desk.cpl open and then I instigate either settings c mode or Preview s mode.  Once these new processes are closed the p mode returns as you would expect but when desk.cpl is closed strongthe p mode process continues to run.strong  This is intermittent however  sometimes it closes, sometimes it doesnt.p  pIn p mode I explicitly emdontem close the form on mouse movement etc as this is not appropriate for the desk.cpl preview window.  My assumption therefore is that desk.cpl would kill my process but this doesnt seem to be happening consistently.p  pQuestionp  pHow can I ensure that p mode will close down consistentlyp

Negative 277 pUpdate  I have an found the cause of codelockcode eating CPU cycles like crazy, I added this information after my original question. This all turned out to be a wall of text sop  pstrongTLDRstrong The c builtin codelockcode mechanism will, under some circumstances, use an unusual amount of CPU time if your system is running with a high resolution system timer.p  pOriginal questionp  pI have an application that access a resource from multiple threads. The resource is a device attached to USB. Its a simple commandresponse interface and I use a small codelockcode block to ensure that the thread that sends a command also gets the response. My implementation uses the lockobj keywordp  precodelock threadLock      WriteLinecommandString     rawResponse  ReadLine  codepre  pWhen I access this from 3 threads as fast as possible in a tight loop the CPU usage is about 24 on a highend computer. Due to the nature of the USB port only about 1000 commandresponse operations are performed per second. Then I implemented the lock mechanism described here a hrefhttpwww.adammil.netblogv111CreatingHighPerformanceLocksandLockfreeCodeforNET.html relnofollowSimpleExclusiveLocka and the code now looks similar to this some trycatch stuff to release the lock in case of an IO exception is removedp  precodeLock.Enter WriteLinecommandString rawResponse  ReadLine Lock.Exit codepre  pUsing this implementation the CPU usage drops to lt1 with the same 3 thread test program while still getting the 1000 commandresponse operations per second.p  pstrongThe question is What, in this case, is the problem using the builtin codelockcode keywordstrong p  pHave I accidentally stumbled upon a case where the codelockcode mechanism has exceptionally high overhead The thread that enters the critical section will hold the lock for only about 1 ms.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The cause of codelockcode eating CPU like crazy is that some application has increased the timer resolution for the whole system using timeBeginPeriod in winmm.dll. The culprits in my case are Google Chrome and SQL Server  they requested a 1 ms system timer resolution usingp  precode[DllImportwinmm.dll, EntryPoint  timeBeginPeriod, SetLastError  true] private static extern uint TimeBeginPerioduint uMilliseconds codepre  pI found this out by using the powercfg toolp  precodepowercfg energy duration 5  codepre  pDue to some sort of design flaw in the builtin codelockcode statement this increased timer resolution eats CPU like crazy at least in my case.  So, I killed the programs that request high resolution system timer. My application now runs a bit slower. Each request will now lock for 16.5 ms instead of 1 ms. The reason behind that I guess is that the threads are scheduled less frequently. The CPU usage as shown in Task Manager also dropped to zero. I have no doubt that codelockcode still uses quite a few cycles but that is now hidden. p  pIn my project low CPU use is an important design factor. The low 1 ms latency of USB requests are also positive for the overall design. So in my case the solution is to discard the builtin codelockcode and replace it with a properly implemented lock mechanism. I already threw out the flawed codeSystem.IO.Ports.SerialPortcode in favor of WinUSB so I have no fears p  pI made a small consoleapplication to demonstrate all of this, pm me if you are interested in a copy 100 lines of code.p  pI guess I answered my own question so Ill just leave this here in case someone is interested...p

Negative 277 pOK, I know this is bad. As a rule, GET requests should be for readonly queries they should not change the state of the server and its data. But how I can handle the next situationp  pA client must fetch all the chat rooms near to him. This typically may be something like codeGET chatroomslatxamplngycode. But, if there are no chatrooms near to him, then a room must be automatically created. Of course this can be achieved doing codePOST chartroomscode. p  pBut this implies 2 requests to the server and I want just to do one a codeGET chatroomslatxamplngycodeand then if there are no rooms, in the server create a new one and return it to the client. So codeGETcode must change, sometimes, the state in the server create a new roomp  pThe server side would be something like this pseudocodep  precodeGET chatrooms ListltChatRoomgt getAll     lat  getQuerylat     lng  getQuerylng     chatRooms[]  findChatRoomsByLatLnglat, lng     if chatRooms.size gt 0  This is the normal GET        return jsonchatRooms, 200     else    In this case GET change the server state        chatRoom  new ChatRoomlat, lng        saveChatRoomchatRoom        return jsonchatRoom, 200 codepre  pThat is my problem.p

Negative 277 pBasically before i implemented inheritence into my game, introducing 2 new classes, player and enemy, not using enemy atm, the level was loaded and drawn including the player paddle during the countdown screen the countdown before the level starts.p  pNow all of the level is drawn apart from the player paddle when i have implemented inheritence into my game, inheriting from a class called Paddle, where the Player and Enemy classes are derived classes. I have experimented between overriding the draw method in the player class from the basepaddle class and then using the draw method in the base class.p  pMaybe its nothing to do with the draw method necessarily but all i know is that the player isnt being drawn during the countdown screen but when the countdown screen finishes, the player is drawn.

Negative 277 pI know this is a bit long question but any help would be appreciated.p  pThe short version is simply that I want to have a set of containers communicating with each other on multiple hosts and to be accessible with SSH. I know there are tools for this but I wasnt able to do it.p  pThe long version isp  pThere is a software that has multiple components and these components can be installed in any number of machines. There is a client and a serverside for this software. Both the clientserver and the server side components communicate via UDP ports. The server uses CentOS, the client uses Microsoft Windows.p  pI want to create a testing environment that consists of 4 containers and these components would be spread across these containers and a client side machine. The docker host machine is Ubuntu, the containers are CentOS. If I install all the components in one container its working, if there are more than its not. According to the logs its working but its not.p  pI read that you need to link the containers or use an orchestrator like Maestro to do this, but I wasnt able to do it so far.p  pWhat I want is to be able to start a set if containers which communicate with each other, on one or multiple hosts. I want to be able to access these containers with ssh so the service should start automatically.p  pAlso it would be great to use ddns for the containers because the names would be used again and again but the IP addresses can change, but this is just the cherry on top.p  pSome specificationsp  pThe host is a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS x8664 Docker is the latest version. lxcdocker 0.10.0 I used the native driver. The containers a plain simple centos pulled from the docker index. I installed some basic stuff on the containers opensshserver, mc, javajre. I changed the docker network to a network that can be reached from the internal network. IP tables rules were cleared, because I didnt needed them, but also tried with those in place but with no luck.

Negative 277 pI have person accounts enabled and i am trying to allow my users to self register for communities and i am looking to configure the CommunitiesSelfRegController apex class to allow it. I understand adding a profile id and a role id but i cant understand why i have to add an account id. I understand why it needs to attach the user to an account but i dont want to attach them to an existing account, that doesnt make any sense for me and my business case i cant see how it would suit most people but anyway. So i think i am asking Is there a way that i can get this class to allow users to self register and it will create them an person account and a user with community access or Is there a way to create a separate object and make a form which inserts all of the data i need then use a trigger or something to create a record on accounts, enable  it for communities and create the appropriate user.p  pI hope i have made sense.

Negative 277 pMy app schedules an RTCWAKEUP alarm that goes off at userdefined intervals. When it fires, I register with Location Services for coarse updates citylevel is more than good enough, wait up to 60 seconds for a single location report, unregister the listener, and then make a locationspecific web query and do various things with the information thats returned.p  pIve been testing in environments where there should always be at emleastem a wireless network available to use for a location fix. The procedure works fine almost all the time, but the log shows that once in a while, the app times out waiting for a location report. This seems to only happen when the alarm wakes the device from sleep emandem the device is deep inside a building where the mobile network connection is flaky. Under these circumstances the wireless network is I think the only possible source of location information, so my hunch is that either a the wireless network is not automatically reconnected when an alarm wakes the device from sleep until someone tries to open a connection, or b 60 seconds just isnt long enough.p  pCan anyone confirm whether either of these things is true If its a, is there a command I can issue that amounts to reconnect the wireless network and then get back to mep  pI could fiddle around with the timeout interval, but even if that appears to solve the problem, I wont be confident Ive truly addressed the root cause until I understand whats going on...p  hr  pSome nittygritty detail about the procedure When the alarm is received, the app kicks off an codeIntentServicecode that registers a codeLocationClientcode with Location Services. It then enters a codewaitcode loop that gives up and returns failure after 60 seconds. The client in turn registers a codeLocationListenercode from its codeonConnectedcode. When that listener receives a report, it stores off the codeLocationcode and codenotifyAllcodes the waiting thread. This is what the codeLocationRequestcode looks like I only want one report, but I want it as fast as possiblep  precodeLocationRequest request  LocationRequest.create request.setPriorityLocationRequest.PRIORITYLOWPOWER request.setInterval0 request.setFastestInterval0 request.setNumUpdates1 codepre

Negative 277 pIve tried multiple ways to install rails on a digital ocean vps, but I keep getting what seems to be an older version of rails 2.x.x. I used railsready and rvm to install ruby and rails, and when I run rails v I get 4.1.1. However, when I try to run the 4.x.x rails commands, it shows me this manual, which I believe is from an older version. I put in just the description, for simplicityp  precodeDescription The rails new command creates a new Rails application with a default directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.  You can specify extra commandline arguments to be used every time rails new runs in the .railsrc configuration file in your home directory.  Note that the arguments specified in the .railsrc file dont affect the defaults values shown above in this help message.  Example rails new CodeRubyweblog  This generates a skeletal Rails installation in CodeRubyweblog. See the README in the newly created application to get going. codepre  pIt seems to me this is from an older version of rails, I just do not understand why it is installing this version when it says it has installed 4.1.1. What could be causing this problem and how can I fix itp

Negative 277 pThe company I work at has been hosting some fusioncharts charts on SharePoint 2007, which worked as they should. However, once SharePoint has been upgraded to the 2013 version, all the charts suddenly stopped working.p  pFirst, it was the problem with browser file handling, which we fixed instantly.p  pBut now, the charts, which work perfectly offline, dont load properly on SharePoint, while inside Page Viewer webparts. Opened the html directly and its the same outside the webpart.p  pBasically what happens is that instead the chart, one can see No data to display, someone found a workaround for that, which is to rewind and forward the flash plugin, what actually displays the chart properly well almost properly, its not resized as it should be.p  pThere are no exceptions thrown by javascript and the files FusionChartshtmlxml are the same as they were on SP2007. Any help would be appreciated.p  pEDIT Requested code below Ive replaced the real data with some fake one, the charts still works offline  Ive checked    p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtChart 1lttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcFusionChartsFusionCharts.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltcentergt     ltdiv idchartContainergtFusionCharts XT will load hereltdivgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgtlt         var myChart  new FusionChartsFusionChartsMSStackedColumn2DLineDY.swf,myChartId, 650, 450, 0, 1          myChart.setXMLUrlmychart1.xml         myChart.renderchartContainer gt     ltscriptgt ltbodygt  codepre  pp  pThe xml filep  precodeltchart     captionChartName     subcaptionSubcaption     xaxisnamePeriod     PYaxisnameData axis     sNumberSuffix     showLegend1     legendNumColumns2     showsum1     formatnumberscale0     rotatevalues1     logoURLlink.png     logoScale100     logoPositionTR     logolinklink.html gt ltcategories fontArial fontSize12 fontColor070708gt     ltcategory labelDecember 2013gt     ltcategory labelJanuary 2014gt     ltcategory labelFebruary 2014gt     ltcategory labelMarch 2014gt     ltcategory labelApril 2014gt     ltcategory labelMay 2014gt ltcategoriesgt  ltdataSetgt     ltdataSet seriesNamedata series color00539F showValues1gt         ltset value123 linklinkgt         ltset value123 linklinkgt         ltset value123 linklinkgt         ltset value123 linklinkgt         ltset value123 linklinkgt         ltset value123 linklinkgt     ltdataSetgt ltdataSetgt    ltstylesgt     ltdefinitiongt         ltstyle namemyAnim typeanimation typeanimation paramalpha startcanvasStartY duration1 gt         ltstyle namemyValuesFont typefont size12 color080807 bold0gt     ltdefinitiongt     ltapplicationgt         ltapply toObjectDataValues stylesmyAnim gt         ltapply toObjectDataValues stylesmyValuesFont gt     ltapplicationgt ltstylesgt ltchartgt codepre  pEDIT2 As I said, Ive managed to solve this problem. Basically what happened was, during the call for .xml file first thing that was loaded by the FusionCharts JS function was a 304 Not Modified response, which is empty. Thats why the flash app wrote No data to display. But once the first response was loaded, the second one containing the xml was loaded too, so after a rewindforward proper data was parsed and shown on the chart. Im not sure what lead to this behaviour, why there was no 304 not modified response on SP2007, so if anyone knows what could be the cause of this, explanation will be welcome. What I did was to change the script to preload the xml into the browsers cache before drawing the chart, then instead of the file, a string variable with the xml is loaded and the chart is shown properly. I post the new code below, the xml is the same as it was.p  precodewindow.onload  function            var myChart  new FusionChartsFusionChartsMSStackedColumn2DLineDY.swf,myChartId, 650, 450, 0, 1          myChart.setXMLDataloadXmlFilechart1.xml         myChart.renderchartContainer         function loadXmlFilesource         var xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest         xmlhttp.openGET, source, false         xmlhttp.setRequestHeaderContentType, textxml         xmlhttp.send         xmlDoc  xmlhttp.responseText           return xmlDoc      codepre

However I cannot seem to connect it to an android application. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, I have tried all that I can think of in order to solve it.p  pstrongLogcat Error report 1strongp  precode0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 FATAL EXCEPTION AsyncTask 1 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 Process com.example.mysqltest, PID 1355 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 java.lang.RuntimeException An error occured while executing doInBackground 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at android.os.AsyncTask3.doneAsyncTask.java300 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.finishCompletionFutureTask.java355 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.setExceptionFutureTask.java222 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java242 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at android.os.AsyncTaskSerialExecutor1.runAsyncTask.java231 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorkerThreadPoolExecutor.java1112 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java587 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java841 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at com.example.mysqltest.RegisterCreateUser.doInBackgroundRegister.java109 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at com.example.mysqltest.RegisterCreateUser.doInBackgroundRegister.java1 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at android.os.AsyncTask2.callAsyncTask.java288 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java237 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     ... 4 more codepre  pLogcat error 2p  precode0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 FATAL EXCEPTION AsyncTask 1 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 Process com.example.mysqltest, PID 1355 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 java.lang.RuntimeException An error occured while executing doInBackground 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at android.os.AsyncTask3.doneAsyncTask.java300 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.finishCompletionFutureTask.java355 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.setExceptionFutureTask.java222 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java242 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at android.os.AsyncTaskSerialExecutor1.runAsyncTask.java231 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorkerThreadPoolExecutor.java1112 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java587 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java841 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at com.example.mysqltest.RegisterCreateUser.doInBackgroundRegister.java109 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at com.example.mysqltest.RegisterCreateUser.doInBackgroundRegister.java1 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at android.os.AsyncTask2.callAsyncTask.java288 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runFutureTask.java237 0724 134117.127 EAndroidRuntime1355     ... 4 more 0724 134117.699 EWindowManager1355 android.view.WindowLeaked Activity com.example.mysqltest.Register has leaked window com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindowDecorView52906bd4 V.E.....

require it within a php script.  Since we want this script to add a new user to our db, we will be talking with our database, and therefore, lets require the connection to happen  requireconfig.inc.php  if posted data is not empty if emptyPOST      If the username or password is empty when the user submits     the form, the page will die.     Using die isnt a very good practice, you may want to look into     displaying an error message within the form instead.       We could also do frontend form validation from within our Android App,     but it is good to have a have the backend code do a double check.     if emptyPOST[username]  emptyPOST[password]             Create some data that will be the JSON response          response[success]  0         response[message]  Please Enter Both a Username and Password.          die will kill the page and not execute any code below, it will also         display the parameter... in this case the JSON data our Android         app will parse         diejsonencoderesponse           if the page hasnt died, we will check with our database to see if there is     already a user with the username specificed in the form.  user is just     a blank variable that we will change before we execute the query.  We     do it this way to increase security, and defend against sql injections     query          SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username  user     now lets update what user should be     queryparams  array         user gt POST[username]           Now lets make run the query     try           These two statements run the query against your database table.          stmt    dbgtpreparequery         result  stmtgtexecutequeryparams          catch PDOException ex           For testing, you could use a die and message.          dieFailed to run query  . exgtgetMessage          or just use this use this one to product JSON data         response[success]  0         response[message]  Database Error1. Please Try Again         diejsonencoderesponse           fetch is an array of returned data.  If any data is returned,     we know that the username is already in use, so we murder our     page     row  stmtgtfetch     if row           For testing, you could use a die and message.          dieThis username is already in use          You could comment out the above die and use this one         response[success]  0         response[message]  Im sorry, this username is already in use         diejsonencoderesponse           If we have made it here without dying, then we are in the clear to      create a new user.  Lets setup our new query to create a user.       Again, to protect against sql injects, user tokens such as user and pass     query  INSERT INTO users  username, password  VALUES  user, pass        Again, we need to update our tokens with the actual data     queryparams  array         user gt POST[username],         pass gt POST[password]           time to run our query, and create the user     try          stmt    dbgtpreparequery         result  stmtgtexecutequeryparams          catch PDOException ex           For testing, you could use a die and message.          dieFailed to run query  . exgtgetMessage          or just use this use this one         response[success]  0         response[message]  Database Error2. Please Try Again         diejsonencoderesponse           If we have made it this far without dying, we have successfully added     a new user to our database.  We could do a few things here, such as      redirect to the login page.  Instead we are going to echo out some     json data that will be read by the Android application, which will login     the user or redirect to a different activity, Im not sure yet..     response[success]  1     response[message]  Username Successfully Added     echo jsonencoderesponse      for a php webservice you could do a simple redirect and die.     headerLocation login.php      dieRedirecting to login.php    else  gt     lth1gtRegisterlth1gt      ltform actionregister.php methodpostgt          Usernameltbr gt          ltinput typetext nameusername value gt          ltbr gtltbr gt          Passwordltbr gt          ltinput typepassword namepassword value gt          ltbr gtltbr gt          ltinput typesubmit valueRegister New User gt      ltformgt     ltphp   gt codepre  pLogcat errorp  precode0724 191630.584 EBandwidthController155 runIptablesCmd res1 status768 failed systembinip6tables t raw A bwrawPREROUTING m owner socketexists 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554 problem enabling bandwidth controls 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554 com.android.server.NativeDaemonConnectorNativeDaemonFailureException command 1 bandwidth enable failed with 400 1 Bandwidth command failed 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.NativeDaemonConnector.executeNativeDaemonConnector.java391 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.NativeDaemonConnector.executeForListNativeDaemonConnector.java327 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.NativeDaemonConnector.executeNativeDaemonConnector.java292 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.NetworkManagementService.prepareNativeDaemonNetworkManagementService.java348 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.NetworkManagementService.systemReadyNetworkManagementService.java224 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.ServerThread2.runSystemServer.java961 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService.systemReadyActivityManagerService.java9363 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.ServerThread.initAndLoopSystemServer.java938 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.server.SystemServer.mainSystemServer.java1179 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java515 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java779 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java595 0724 191630.584 ANetworkManagementService554    at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 0724 191630.588 EWifiStateMachine554 Failed to reload STA firmware java.lang.IllegalArgumentException command 2 softap fwreload eth1 STA failed with 501 2 SoftAP command has failed codepre

Negative 277 pIve got a binary tree, where the nodes interact with data. I initially implemented a standard post order recursive traversal. p  precodedef visitrecself, node, data     if node         self.visitrecnode.left, data         self.visitrecnode.right, data          node.dostuffdata codepre  pI thought I could improve it by using generators so that I can use the same traversal method for other uses, and not have to pass the same data around constantly. This implementation is shown below.p  precodedef visitrecgenself, node     if node         for n in self.visitrecgennode.left                 yield n         for n in self.visitrecgennode.right                 yield n          yield node  for node in self.visitrecgen     node.dostuffdata codepre  pHowever, this was far slower than the previous version 50s to 17s and used far more memory. Have I made a mistake in my generator function version Id prefer to use this method but not at the expense of performance.p  pEDIT Something I should have mentioned initially was that these results were obtained under PyPy 2.3.1, rather than standard CPython.p

Negative 277 pI have a web page containing a table of information sourced from a backend database. In this table is a usually unique key, provided by a third party which I have little control of.p  pBecause HTML codeidcode attributes are case insensitive, must be unique, and can contain only certain characters, Ive resorted to using an MD5 hash to create them based on the unique database keys. The keys themselves are far from meeting HTML codeidcode tag standards.p  precodeusrbinperl  use strict use warnings  use DigestMD5 qwmd5hex  my extens  qw g h i j k l m n o p q   sub GenHTMLid       my id  md5hex [0]        HTML 4.01 does not allow IDs that begin with numbers     id  s[09]extens[1]      return id  codepre  pThis seems to work for most cases, but isnt ideal for my situation due to the length 32 characters of the keys being created.p  pMy guess is that a generator which used the entire set of lowercase alphabetic characters would likely need far fewer characters to be generally unique.p  pIve been searching through CPAN and the internet for a module to create these tags, but havent found one. Does anyone happen to know of one, or have a solution that would require far fewer charactersp  pAdditional Info  The DB engine is Sybase.  The keys provided by 3rd party are 6 to 7 fields, separated by a slash  character.  Though many are the fields may only contain specific values, two of the fields are free hand, and often contain characters you would not want to appear in an HTML id tag, like   [ ] lt      ,  and space.  The entire key all fields and separators are stored in a simple varchar, after some very minor translation  to prevent Sybase from complaining.  The id tag is required by 3rd party web apps, so I can not easily change it to data.p
Negative 277 pI have read on a lot of sites that for iPhone 6 Plus the image asset needs to be three times as big as the actual image, so it therefor needs to be a 3x image. And then 2x is for iPhone 6 all the way down to iPhone 4 and then just the original size for iPhone 3GS and below.p  pMy main question is that am I right in saying this and if so, what if Apple changes the iPhones screen size again one day, will they make developer make a 4x image too I just think its getting a bit out of hand.p  pWhat is the best way to sort all this image sizes out Do you just make all the image assets for your app 3 times as big when you are designing them and then make a smaller 2x and 1x version of themp  pThanks for your time, Dan.p

I tried using this functionp  precodepublic int memoryPercent     Double allocnew DoubleRuntime.getRuntime.totalMemory1048576     Double availnew DoubleRuntime.getRuntime.maxMemory1048576     double per allocavail100     int printper     Log.eMemory used,Integer.toStringpr     return pr  codepre  pIt returns a value that indeed increases when more bitmaps are loaded. But it does not decrease when bitmaps are recycled. What other options do I have p  pI have thought of calculating the byte size of each bitmap and add them to see their total size and then substruct those that are recycled trying to keep their total size under the value that Runtime.getRuntime.maxMemory returns...But this sounds too messy. there has to be a better wayp

Negative 277 pIm taking a coding class at school and am very new to javascript, so hopefully what Im asking will make sensep  pRight now I have a page where if you click an html button, an image of a worm appears in a div below it called bugs. the same image appears each time you click the button. Ive done this by having the button click call a function that creates an img element and adds it as a child of the div. the issue is I want the images to move randomly around the page or even just inside the div. Ive found some code that will animate a div so it moves randomly using jQuery a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10385950howtogetadivtorandomlymovearoundapageusingjqueryorcssherea, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to apply it to the images. p  pThe js code that makes the images looks like thisp  precodevar BugSpace  document.getElementByIdbugs  function NewWorm   WormPic  document.createElementimg   WormPic.src  worm.png   BugSpace.appendChildWormPic  codepre  pMost of my code is pieced together from various tutorials so is likely pretty convoluted. anyway, if anyone can figure this out Ill be eternally grateful  p  pEdit I suppose I should further clarify that the code includes two other buttons to make two other types of bugs Id like to be able to have a few images of each bug moving on the page at once. I figure the best way to do this is to find a way to animate the children of the bug div I am, however, wondering if the answer to my problem might turn out to be a complete reworking of the code I have nowp
Negative 277 pWhen using Jquery mobile, When you select an option from a select with the keyboard, you cannot tab to the next input in the DOM.

In the mobile version its someplace else... and I dont know where. You have tab a lot for the focus to move to the first input again... then through the inputs to the field you want after the select you just used.p  pPersonally I reckon this is a bug, so the most interfering I felt prepared to do was to try the on change trigger to try and set the focus back to the select like thisp  precodesel.onchange, function e      sel.focus  codepre  pBut this does not work. If you do the focus call anywhere else, it works as expected, highlighting correctly and tabbing off if you do not change the value. but as soon as you change the value the focus is someplace else.p  pI can set the focus to the next item howeverp  precodesel.onchange, function e      ender.focus  codepre  pBut Id rather not do this as this means I cant do some of the dynamic hiding of inputs Im doing and have to programmatically mirror the flow handling in the form.p  pIve tried updating some of wrapper stuff that JQM adds and Ive tried setting focus on another input and then back again, and then optionally doing a selectmenu refresh, but the mobile still cant tab out to the next input. Ive also tried various blur and focus calls all to no avail.p  pI did see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4649604jqueryselectnexttextfieldonenterkeypressthis answera doing something similar by adding a keydown handler, but since I dont know where the focus is after a value change I dont know where to add the keydown handler... besides this sounds like a JQuery Mobile bug doesnt itp  pDo you know how I can make tab and focushighlight work correctly after a select change in JQuery Mobilep  pIs this a bug I should reportp

Negative 277 pSince we can point and click in SSMS to obtain DDL, there must be an assembly or DLL of some sort called by the GUI.  Does anyone have any familiarity with how to tap into thatp  pThe drive for this comes from our need to capture DDL as part of jobs.  Some of our batches only need the data for one table or even one index, others could use the entire database.  Getting the detail as needed is critical.  That detail might be used as part of a procedure or placed into a file.p  pI know there are various solutions to the problem of batchautomated retrieval of SQL Server DDL versions 20002014 on the web.  None are directly supported by Microsoft, and for what I need, that is a considerable weakness. p  pOf the items on the web, some use scripts and the system viewstables to build DDL.  I admire the work that went into these, but such things may have problematic support and can break from SQL Server version to SQL Server version.  Also, a number of vendors have tools, and there is at least one open source project OpenDiff that ventures into this area.  But vendor tools wont easily fit into my batch streams.  And third party tools also require installation on client systems, which is always a sensitive area, and usually have licensing requirements.  Any third party tool, of course, introduces the various types of vendor dependencies.p  pThere is one item I have found, SMOScript, that uses SMOs with which I am only slightly familiar.  Perhaps that is doing something similar to what I want, though the limited notes on the project imply that it does not allow the detail needed such as for a single index.  From a management viewpoint, it also introduces a dependency on that project and its single author.  p  pThat assembly used by SSMS, whatever it is, must be kept up to date by MS.  If calling that is possible though I am sure it is foolish to hope it is also simple, the weakness of a third party dependency is eliminated.  So I dont need web links to scripts and third party tools for those I have yet thanks for the thought, but if someone can point me toward what SSMS is using, that might be a great help.  In the meantime, for what its worth, Ill be researching SMOs.p

Negative 277 pI have a concern that I would like some input on to see if there is a solution.  We have an ecosystem of about 30 web applications that all connect to the same database.  We are going to be updating the applications and with that we are going to be moving to a new database schema.  I have a process that will be pulling all the old data into the new schema using EF CodeFirst for the new schema.  p  pWell, today I ran into an issue when two branches of the solution that I wrote to migrate the data have a slightly different schema one branch put a MaxLength on a field and an index on another.  The issue that I had was that the database was out of sync in one branch, but uptodate in the other and the branch that was out of sync would not run until I ran UpdateDatabase.p  pI was thinking about putting the codefirst poco classes into a library along with the DataContext to be able to be used by the various web apps.  I would then make this library available to the team using an internal NuGet server.p  pMy concern is that if the schema changes doesnt happen very often, but it does happen what happens to all of the web applications that are relying on this library for data connectivity  Would they all break my assumption is that they would  If so, all of the production web apps would be down.  Is there a way to get around thisp

Negative 277 pIm working on various iOS apps and I need an interface with the following capabilitiesp  ol lipI have a scrollview covering most of the screen which is scrollable both directionspli lipThis scrollable view contains a lot of rectangles. These rectangles are intractable. User can modify them, move them around, create and delete. So ideally they would be all CALayers or UIViews.pli lipThe problem is because there could be 100s or 1000s of those displayed at once, CALayers or UIViews may not be very efficient.pli lipThe scrollview could be 1020 times bigger than the screen size itself. And fully covered with these shapes. So when the user scrolls it shouldnt see any flickers or shapes appearing after the scrolling is done. e.g. If I use CATiledLayer and user scrolls, you can see things drawn after scrolling is done.pli lipSmooth zooming. Zooming out is particularly challenging, because the shapes would need to be drawn on parts of the view which are going to become visible. Also, ideally Id rather not use something like CGAffineTransform to perform scaling, I like to have a pixel accurate scaling.pli ol  pIve tried various things, but I cant seem to be able to get decent frame rates even on iPhone 6. Even tried drawing every frame, but its too expensive Core Graphics to handle it. Is there code examples someone trying to do a similar thing or an open source library Im trying not to use OpenGL, I feel like its an overkill, but I will try it if I have to. FYI, I have no experience in OpenGL yet.p  pProcreate for iPad does what Im trying to do perfectly, its super responsive and zooming is pixel accurate. I know they use OpenGL and Im not making drawing apps. The reason I mention it is because it shows what Im trying to do is possible.p

Negative 277 pIm struggling to find an answer to what I thought would be a relatively straightforward problem, and wondered if anyone could helpp  pIt is to find a way of allowing users to open downloaded HTML files in an email client such as MS Outlook without having to save them first.p  pWe have a Webbased application that allows users to upload files, including emails. To do this, they need to save the email onto their network, and then upload the saved file via the browsers file select control. The files are saved in an Oracle database, and we have a utility that allows the user to later download the saved email. When they do so, they are given the option to Open or Save.p  pWhen the email was saved using the .msg format, opening the downloaded email opens that email in Outlook, and all the usual email functionality is available. However, if the email is saved in HTML, selecting open always loads the email content into the browser.p  pIs there a way of invoking Outlook when the user opens an HTML file from the Web app, so that they dont have to either 1 always save their emails as .msg files or 2 download the email to the network and use open with to open it in Outlookp  pThe download utility allows us to set the MIME type, but applicationvnd.msoutlook and the various emailrelated types have no effect so that an HTML email always opens in the browser.p  pWe have also tried changing the filename extension to .msg, but this results in an Outlook error message and the email does not open. Removing the file extension altogether means that the file still opens in the browser.p  pChanging the HTMHTML file associations so that they open with Outlook is not an option for us, Im afraid.p  pDoes anyone know of a solution to this Although the problem as Ive described it isnt such a big deal for our users, we were hoping to generate draft emails programmatically for users to edit and send, but without the ability to open an HTML file in Outlook, this is going to be a lot trickier than wed hoped.p  pOur main network browser is still IE7, incidentally.p  pMany thanks for your help with this.p

Negative 277 pSorry if this is a newb question.  I looked around on this a bit and most of the examples I saw didnt really address my concern.p  pSay I have a bunch of widgets.  Each one needs an independent random variable stream.  Im using CUDA so Id like to use curand.  In the kernel Im going to be accessing the curandState multiple times.  My question is, what is the best way to do this with regards to good memory access patterns.  It seems that curandState is 48 bytes.p  pSimple Examplep  precodeglobal void goWidgetRunfloat widgetNum, curandState state    int idx  blockIdx.x  blockDim.x  threadIdx   widgetNum[idx]  curanduniformampstate[idx]  codepre  pThat seems to work but if I dop  precodenvprof metrics gldefficiency .widgetRunner codepre  pI get something along the lines of 22.92.  Launch is ltltlt131072, 128  My, perhaps flawed, understanding is that each warp is working with 48  32 1,536 bytes of contiguous memory so Im confused why the efficiency is so low.p  pI also triedp  precodecurandState rand  state[idx] widgetNum[idx]  curanduniformamprand state[idx]  rand codepre  pwhich I imagine is preferred if I need to use it multiple times per kernel, however it still gives a low efficiency number.p  pIs there a better way to get independent streams or a better way to do this  Would shared memory helpp  pThanks for any advicep  pUPDATE Thanks Michal for the information  Going to look around a bit more to find something cheaper.  Im not a big fan of reinitializing and the curand doc specifically mentions that its not the best approach especially since I cant use clock for seeding.  This is where Im heading if someone has suggestions or stumbles upon this laterp  pa hrefhttphttp.developer.nvidia.comGPUGems3gpugems3ch37.html relnofollowhttphttp.developer.nvidia.comGPUGems3gpugems3ch37.htmlap  pI dont know how this works.

Negative 277 pIve been a lurker for over a year now and Ive never had a question that wasnt already asked and solved thanks for that until now. Perhaps all you brilliant people can help me outp  pFirst and foremost Im on a Macbook Pro Retina, using OSX 10.10.1 Yosemite, and Python 2.7.6p  pSo Ive got a python script that sends emails using SMTP and it works great. It runs in the terminal perfectly. p  pNow, I have been trying to incorporate this script into Launchd, so that it runs every 24 hours. I want to have it attempt initiation in the morning so that when I open my laptop typically around 10 am, the script will run automatically and send the emails, since Launchd is supposed to start jobs that should have been sent when the computer was asleep as soon as it wakes up.p  pI had some issues with writing the Launchd plist script initially, but I ironed those out by using the LaunchedControl GUI I know, I was disappointed that I couldnt do it without the GUI too. Now when I load and run the Launchd job, it calls the python script and sends the emails just fine and dandy. However, it fails to run the script the next day without unloading and reloadingstarting. p  pBefore you ask, yes, I have the StartInterval set at 86,400 seconds aka 24 hours. p  pAnyone have any ideas why its not running the script upon reawakening I thought it might be that its running it before my laptop has connected to the internet.. How can I make my Launchd script wait a until I have a connectionp  pLet me know if you would like me to provide any of the code and I will promptly do so.p

Negative 277 pI have this app Im developing and I thought of moving the VM I was using to real hardware. My Raspberry Pi 2 came to mind, a quadcore 900mhz ARM v7 with 1GB of ram. This hardware clocks at twice the speed I set my VM to run a typical low end VPS equivalent so it should be more than enough.p  pInstalled Raspbian, nginx and the nodejs package from their repository using aptget. Everything is super But I noticed this distinct slowness when accessing the app. Its like a 710 sec pause before everything loads.p  pTo test it further I installed fullfledged Node.js app called Tiddlywiki which I installed and used many times in the past. And its true, there it was again that 710 sec delay when you refresh the page. p  pThe app seems to run fine, POST and GET is instant once its up and running in the Web Browser, but the delay is there if I refresh the page. p  pNOTE If I restart the Pi and wait for it to restart the first time I access the app URL the delay seems to double, about 15 sec. Nginx html pages seem lightning fast in comparison.p  pAny thoughts on thisp

Negative 277 pIve been trying to figure out how to use Python to find roots. If Im understanding the documentation correctly, scipy.optimize.newtonf,xo can be used to find roots, f is a function and xo an initial guess at the root.p  pThe functions Im working with are all polynomials and for the purposes Ive ever used Python for interpolation and linefitting its always been sufficient to express a polynomial by an array of coefficients. Defining f in this manner gives me a numpy.ndarray error and Im assuming its because Im giving f as an array and newtonf,xo is expecting a function for f. p  pIm pretty inexperienced with Python and when I came across this I realized I actually dont know how to define generally f without having to define another variable thatll limit it to an interval. For some arbitrary polynomial, e.g. f  2x2  7, is there a way to define f without having to give an interval for x Normally Im used to having to also define x  arangen or something like that which limits it to an interval.  p

I have my Panda class, GraphOfPanda and I set up a small graph between them, I traverse all of them using BFS, as far as I can tell just to print each Panda vertice. p  precodenamespace PandaGraph.PandaSocialNetwork  public class Panda      public Pandastring name              this.Name  name           public string Name  get private set       public override string ToString              return string.FormatI am Panda 0,             this.Name           public override bool Equalsobject obj              var anotherPanda  obj as Panda         if anotherPanda  null return this.Name  anotherPanda.Name          return false           public override int GetHashCode              return string.Formatthis.ToString.GetHashCode         namespace PandaGraph.PandaSocialNetwork  using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System  public class GraphOfPandas      private DictionaryltPanda, ListltPandagtgt pandaGraph      public GraphOfPandas              this.pandaGraph  new DictionaryltPanda, ListltPandagtgt           public void PrintAllNodesUsingBFSPanda startPanda              var visitedVertices  new ListltPandagt         var queue  new QueueltPandagt         queue.EnqueuestartPanda          whilequeue.Any                      var currentPanda  queue.Dequeue             ifvisitedVertices.ContainscurrentPanda                 visitedVertices.AddcurrentPanda              var neighbours  this.pandaGraph[currentPanda]                 .Wherex gt visitedVertices.Containsx              foreach var neihbour in neighbours                 queue.Enqueueneihbour                   foreachvar visited in visitedVertices             Console.WriteLinevisited            public ListltPandagt GetPandaVertices              return this.pandaGraph.Keys.ToList           public ListltPandagt GetFriendsPanda p              return this.pandaGraph[p].ToList           public void AddPandaPanda p              if this.pandaGraph.ContainsKeyp                      this.pandaGraph.Addp, new ListltPandagt                  else                      throw new ArgumentExceptionPanda is already in the graph                    public void MakeFriendsPanda a, Panda b              if this.pandaGraph.ContainsKeya                      this.AddPandaa                   if this.pandaGraph.ContainsKeyb                      this.AddPandab                   var friends  this.pandaGraph[a]         if friends.Containsb                      this.pandaGraph[a].Addb             this.pandaGraph[b].Adda                  codepre  pHow do I get the shortest path while still using BFS between two Pandas in my undirected graph I prefer explanation with some code example, and sorry if you think its a bad asked question and I do not know how to make my code appear better.p
Negative 277 pI am developing Glassware with GDK and Immersive design pattern.In GDK developer document mentioned as,p  blockquote   pSpecify androidimmersivetrue for your  element to give   immersions focus after a screen sleeps and wakes up.p blockquote  pI added this attribute in my activities on Manifest.But When screen off and ON again,shows codeOK Glasscode screen only,then launch my glassware it goes to same page I left when screen off.I need to go directly to my glassware screen.Is it possible to do this p
Negative 277 pI have a PHP script to backup a database as codedbName.sqlcode which can be accessible by anyone. I need to encryptdecrypt the backup database to be accessible only in my application. How can I do thisp  pNote I have a list page to download all database backups. I want my server to be able to use the database only. p
Negative 277 pI have 3 dynamic sets of elements on one side. e.g. brp  precodea  [101,102,104] possible values 101 to 115 b  [201,202] possible values 201 to 210 c  [301,302,303,304] possible values 301 to 305 codepre  pI generate all combinations of these 3 sets e.g. p  precodesetA  [101201301,303, 101,104202304, 101,104202301,304, ...] codepre  pa,b,c are out of picture at this point. Now I want to match all elements of setA against another set setB which has only one element from each category. e.g.p  precodesetB  [101202304,104202301 ,102202303, ...]  codepre  pTheres an n to m mapping between codesetAcode and codesetBcode. i.e One combination from setA can have multiple match in setB and vice versa. p  pMatching criteria for any element of setB e.g.101202304 if all of its parts 101,202,304 are contained in some combinations of setA e.g. 101,104202304, 101,104202301,304 then consider it a match. so in this example 101202304 is said to have a match with both 101,104202304 and 101,104202301,304p  pCurrently I have On2 time and On space algorithm but I am really looking for some improvements as this calculation repeats for many such sets. Its actually a reducer task of a hadoop mapreduce where I generate all combinations of dimensions and aggregate measures that qualifies for given combination. Any framework level optimization is welcome too. e.g. breaking down job in multiplejobs.p

Negative 277 pCurrently our company uses a very simple login system involving salted MD5 hashes stored in a database and compared with passwords POSTED to a PHP page. We manage page view permission using PHPGACL. Now that our company has shifted from managing a couple dozen logins to a few hundred this system obviously not only presents a security threat but is also a maintenance hassle as we start to integrate more enterprise tools into our system and need users to have distinct logins for each tool.p  pFrom my understanding, OpenLDAP will allow us to replace this system with a single login that works across many platforms google services, JIRA, etc and a more secure password encryption mechanism. It would also still allow us to maintain the same page access controls that phpGACL offers.p  pIs this correct or do I have some fundamental misunderstanding of what LDAP is supposed to do Are there any technologies other than OpenLDAP that would be necessary for migrating a system like the one we currently have Ive heard good things about LDAP but Im still not very clear on what it actually does and does not do.p

The third column contains a count at that chromosome and position.p  pFile2.txt looks like thisp  precodeChr1    1   10 Chr1    5   15 Chr1    10  20 Chr1    15  25 Chr5    1   10 codepre  pIt specifies windows that are 10 positions apart will be in the sorted order the starting position goes up in increments of 5, but the window size is 10.p  hr  pI need to average the count within each window.p  pThe window for Chr1 position 1 to Chr1 position 10 has combined count 003050000715 So the average is 1510size of the window  1.5p  pThe window for Chr1 position 5 to Chr1 position 15 has combined count 5000070009021 So the average is 2111size of the window  1.909p  pThe window for Chr1 position 10 to Chr1 position 20 has combined count 7000900000016 So the average is 1611size of the window  1.454p  pThe window for Chr1 position 15 to Chr1 position 25 last 5 positions are out of range has combined count 0000000 So the average is 0p  pemThe window for Chr5 position 1 to Chr5 position 10 no records in file1.txt So the average is 0emp  pThe output should bep  precodeChr1    1   10  1.5 Chr1    5   15  1.909 Chr1    10  20  1.454 Chr1    15  25  0 Chr5    1   10  0 codepre  pemNotice how Chr2 isnt in the output file because there werent any windows specified for Chr2 in file2em.. p  pIve coded something in perl to solve the problem, however, it is rather slow due to the large size of file1.txt. Is this problem solvable using awk Im hoping it might offer a faster and shorter solution..p  pIm guessing the solution would involve an associative array, but so far all Ive figured out is how to join on column1 and 2, which is not even close to solving the problem..p  precodeawk FNRNRa[1,2]3next print a[1,2] file1.txt file2.txt codepre  pOr is this problem not suited for awk p

Negative 277 pIm writing a custom WebApi Authorization filter.p  pI need to read the codesecuritySqlConnectionStringcode back from the codeactionContextcode variable.  To do this, I need to perform a cast e.g. as I have attempted using codeTransactionRequestBundleltSearchDefaultgtcode, however, the problem is that in codeTransactionRequestBundleltTgtcode, codeTcode will vary, hence the cast below will only work for type codeTransactionRequestBundleltSearchDefaultgtcode.  As it turns out, I am not actually concerned with the information stored in codeTcode, so I would be happy to disregard the information stored in it.  I thought therefore that I might be able to get away with casting to codeobjectcode as shown here, but this gives me a runtime cast error.p  precodevar securitySqlConnectionString    TransactionRequestBundleltobjectgt   actionContext.ActionArguments[transactionRequestBundle]   .Transaction.SecuritySqlConnectionString codepre  pSo can anyone provide me with any guidance on what I need to do to get the line above to work correctly, specifically what do I replace codeobjectcode withp  precodepublic class XsycoApiAuthorizationFilter     ActionFilterAttribute, IActionFilter      public override void OnActionExecutingHttpActionContext actionContext            var securitySqlConnectionString          TransactionRequestBundleltobjectgt           actionContext.ActionArguments[transactionRequestBundle]           .Transaction.SecuritySqlConnectionString        if CacheMachine.GetEnvironments.Count  0                CacheLoader.LoadsecuritySqlConnectionString                       base.OnActionExecutingactionContext        public class TransactionRequestBundleltTgt      public Transaction Transaction     public T Model  get set      public XsycoDebugBundle XsycoDebugBundle  get set       public TransactionRequestBundle              this.Transaction  new Transaction         this.XsycoDebugBundle  new XsycoDebugBundle         this.Model  Activator.CreateInstanceltTgt         public class Transaction         public string SecuritySqlConnectionString  get set   codepre

Negative 277 pI am using kdtrees from wekas library to find the nearest neighbor for a project I am working on. It was taking too long to create the model so I decided I wanted to serialize it so I only had to wait for it to be made once.  I KDTrees already implement the serializable class. I also have a custom distance function which I made serializable as well. This might just be a bug on wekas part but after I load my kdtree from a file I serialized earlier, everything seems to work fine except when I call kNearestNeighborstestInstance, 10 instead of giving me the 10 nearest neighbors, it gives me all nearest neighbors. This only happens when I deserialize a tree not when I create one from scratch. Also for some reason it works correctly for when k1, but if k 1 it gives me all instances. Also for extra information, when I deserialize i get the dataset from the deserialized kdtree instead of from the original arff file that stored the data. And the testInstance I use for finding the nearest neighbor is created from scratch.p

Negative 277 pI have a method of doing this that involves R programming language, but Im looking to do this purely in excel instead to save time and make it more user friendly.p  pBasically, I need to calculate the distance between all combinations of points x,y coordinates for histological analysis.The data collected is in the form X and Y columns. There may only be two or three points, there could be as many as 100.  Imagining a data set consists of points x,y 1,2,3 and 4. I would need to calculate distances 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4, 2 to 3, 2 to 4 and 3 to 4. p  pIdeally, I would have a macro that prompts you to select the X column, then the y column, click ok, then copies the resulting distances to the clipboard or to a new workbook. p  pAny thoughts on this or refer me to preexisting forums that may be similar to thisp  pMostly, I lack the knowledge of how combinations work in VBA and how to keep the x and y for any given point together.p

Negative 277 pLets say Ive got this particular piece of codep  precode  Generate new wave of enrollees                                 for int i  1 i lt new Random.NextenrolleesExpectedPerMinuteMin, enrolleesExpectedPerMinuteMax ampamp enrolleesInCampus lt enrolleesExpectedTotal i      Enrollee newEnrollee  new EnrolleeENRL  i, i     listOfEnrollees.AddnewEnrollee     enrolleesInCampus  listOfEnrollees.Count         lblEnrolleesInCampusNum.Text  enrolleesInCampus.ToString     newEnrollee.enrolllistOfOffices  codepre  pNote that that runs on the tick method of a GUI timer. See, Im generating codeEnrolleecode objects. And they have a function called codeenrollcode which takes up an argument, which is a list of all the codeOfficecode objects that an codeEnrolleecode may go to.p  pEach codeOfficecode object has a list of codeServiceLanecode objects. These codeServiceLanecode objects have a queue of codeEnrolleescode and also, methods called codeenqueuecode and codedequeuecode. codeenqueuecode simply takes in an argument of type codeEnrolleecode and adds it to the codeenrolleesInLinecode list, which speaks of the codeEnrolleecode objects queued on the codeServiceLanecode object. The codedequeuecode method, of course, performs a dequeue, but I need it to perform the dequequeing after a certain varying processing time required by the codeServiceLanecode.p  pThe codeServiceLanescode an codeEnrolleecode goes to is dependent upon the the type of codeEnrolleecode and the current codeOfficecode they need to get into, therefore, I structured the codeenrollcode method like thisp  precodepublic void enrollListltOfficegt offices      switch type              case EnrolleeType.NEWSTUDENT              code goes here              i.e.               lineInOfficeOne  after being attended toafter being serviced              lineInOfficeTwo  and so on             break         case EnrolleeType.OLDSTUDENT              code goes here              break         case EnrolleeType.TRANSFEREE               code goes here             break       codepre  pWith each Enrollee object, I want them to be enqueued on the shortest Service Lane on the current Office they need to get into. And I think Ive successfully created a method of that in my Office class  it returns the ServiceLane object with the shortest queue of enrollees.p  pHowever, strongproblem onestrong lies in delaying the enqueue method for all Enrollee objects. In real life, an enrollee couldnt get to an office building immediately. The enrollee needs time to go there. Im planning to use Timers but Im not really sure how to do this. I tried. LOL. And I could only get a one two three codeEnrolleecode objects to be enqueued on a codeServiceLanecode, when Ive already generated hundreds of them. Heres how I did itp  precodepublic void enrollListltOfficegt offices      switch walkingSpeed              case EnrolleeWalkingSpeed.SLOW divisor  5 break         case EnrolleeWalkingSpeed.NORMAL divisor  3 break         case EnrolleeWalkingSpeed.FAST divisor  1 break           timer.Elapsed  timerElapsed            REMINDER Update currentActivity every time the enrollee gets                    into the next phase                                                    Make an algorithm for choosing the shortest lane                       Office classs findShortestLane                              switch type              case EnrolleeType.NEWSTUDENT             performActivityEnrolleeActivity.ACT1, offices.Findoffice gt office.getName.EqualsAdmissions Office             break         case EnrolleeType.TRANSFEREEE             performActivityEnrolleeActivity.ACT1, offices.Findoffice gt office.getName.EqualsAdmissions Office             break         case EnrolleeType.OLDSTUDENT             performActivityEnrolleeActivity.ACT9, offices.Findoffice gt office.getName.EqualsFinance Office             break        private void timerElapsedobject sender, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e      if counter  divisor  0              timer.Enabled  false         currentOffice.findShortestLane.enqueuethis         return           counter   public void performActivityEnrolleeActivity activity, Office office      this.currentActivity  activity     this.currentOffice  office     timer.Enabled  true  codepre  pstrongProblem twostrong is how to delay the dequeueing process of the codeServiceLanecode object. Of course, we need an adequate time to have the request processed. Note, they can only be dequeued one at a time per codeServiceLanecode.p  pstrongProblem threestrong is how to let the Enrollee object only be enqueued on another service lane only when the current service lane its on is finished with the Enrollee objects request or rather, the processing time has already been reachedhas elapsed.p  pI do know what to search for, hence its more likely that the title of this question is confusing.

Negative 277 pI am taking the Practical Machine Learning on Coursera and I am confused with one of the assignments. I want to be very clear that I am not posting because I want someone to give me the answer  I just want stronghelp to understand what is happening.strongp  pWe are learning about PCA and preprocessing. My understanding is that PCA is all about trying to collapse multiple colinear variables together into one factor, and that the PCA algorithm tries to find the best linear combination of these while using the least number of variables. For example, if I have 5 correlated highly variables, the PCA might find that just using 4 of them in a certain combination explains the most variance. Then, when you do the training, it applies whatever that combination of variables and coefficients was a single predictor instead of the individual variables is that rightp  pWhat I am having trouble understanding is what is happening behind the scenes.

Negative 277 pAll meteor methods can be called same way from client and server side.p  pLets say user knows or can predict all the method names on server, then he is able to call them and use its result however he want.p  pexample A method which performs cross domain http request and return response can be used to overload server by calling huge amounts of data codeMeteor.callhttpLoad, google.comcode, or a method which load data from mongo can be used to access database documents if the client know document id codeMeteor.callgetUserData, jh9d3nd9sn3jscode.p  pSo, how to avoid this situations, may be there is a better way to store serveronly functions than in codeMeteor.methods...codep

Negative 277 pI am working on History management for my application. I have two views, one is login and the other is main application. I have added local links login and application. Now ideally what should happen is, when the user opens the application he should see the login view which has login token. It works fine. Then when his credentials are validated he goes to application view with token application. And when he logs out he goes back to login. All this works fine. But what bothers me is when I change the link token from login to application manually, the main application opens directly even after I have logged out. But when I try the same thing in a new tab, it works fine. The application is vulnerable to attacks which needs to be fixed.

Negative 277 pTechnologies like LINQ do a good job being able to describe relational data queries, with types such as codeIQueryablecode, codeIGroupingcode, and codeIOrderedQueryablecode modeling emprojectionsem, emselectionsem, emaggregationsem, emsortingem, etc.  These concepts from relational algebra allow us to communicate a fairly arbitrary query in one language on one machine and execute it in a different language sql on a different machine.p  pIt would be nice to be able to do the same thing for even more complicated multipart queries and even for data manipulation commands involving codeINSERTcodes, codeUPDATEcodes, and codeDELETEcodes which can emdescribeem the full operation without the overhead of first retrievinghydrating the data in the application layer which is typical of ObjectRelationalMappers or ORMs.  p  pIn the application, we could describe an operation like emDelete all strongCustomersstrong and their strongOrdersstrong whose most recent strongOrderstrong is older than 2 yearsem and further, assume cascading deletes are not turned on for that relationship.  This is certainly doable efficiently over say, ADO with a tsql script, but cannot be done in ORMs the without overhead of selecting, transmitting, hydrating, and tracking the data in the application layer and possibly issuing individual delete commands.  Maybe theres some optimizations available for ORMs that can do this more efficiently in certain cases but generally AFAIK they cannot  A problem with issuing the tsql script, of course, is that theres no type checking within the statement nor for any parameters or return data.p  pAn earthshattering advantage to being able to model these arbitrary commands for remote execution, besides reduced runtime processing and network chatter overhead, is that domainwide invariants could be encoded and registered in the application layer that could then be automatically emitted along with any adhoc command.  p  pWe might have a silly domain invariant codeAcode that emFor all strongCustomerstrongs, the sum of their strongOrderstrongs strongpricestrongs cannot exceed 10,000,000.00 unless the strongwhoastrong bit is 1em and another silly domain invariant codeBcode that says emFor all strongCustomerstrongs, stronglastNamestrong cant contain more than three underscoresem despite that these perhaps could be enforced through native mechanisms of check constraints or triggers in the database engine itself.  Then when we issue a command to update an existing strongOrderstrongs strongpricestrong, the system can know through static analysis that invariant codeAcode might be violated as a result of the command and that invariant codeBcode could not and therefore the system would emit some assertion of codeAcode after the original command.  The whole emitted script would be wrapped in a transaction for rollback if the assertion fails and the invariant could be automatically narrowed to assert the rule only against the specific strongCustomerstrongs set of strongOrdersstrong rather than unnecessarily rechecking emallem strongCustomerstrongs totals.  I believe this kind of optimized, centralized, DRY, business rule encodingenforcement is not possible in todays databases.p  pIn order to realize this potential, I figure we need an algebra beyond the relational algebra of codeSELECTcode that describes arbitrary data manipulation of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE which is collectively referred to as emDMLem and even things like intermediate computed values like temporary tables for computation that is represented as a multistatement listing in tsql.  p  pUnfortunately, I have been unable to find research about formalizing DML into an algebra, or being able to model it, or metaprogramming of this kind.  Are you able to lend clarity to thisp  hr  pSome discussion which I think was valuable, but I want to avoid filling up the comments with itp  blockquote   pAre you suggesting that domain models arent a good fit to protect invariants and establishing transactional boundaries The invariants you mentioned arent hard to protect using a proper domain model. What problem are you trying to avoid exactlyp blockquote  p  plalxp  blockquote   pAs I understand it, large domains in typical ddd require bounded contexts to avoid having to hydrate large subsets of the data into the application layer for validation. I am trying to avoid that overhead. Also, domain invariants must be nontrivially restated for each bounded context, which is errorprone. By modeling the operations for remote execution, we get smartersmallerfastermore correct code. p      pIn some core library, the domain could be modeled and the invariants registered. Then consumers of that library, such as for a web service, could then construct typechecked descriptions of arbitrary operations without explicit consideration for bounded contexts or particular invariants. The domain core offers to its consumers this is the full range of what you can do over this domain and perhaps the service code offers to its clients these are the exact features were offering.p blockquote  p  uosp  blockquote   pIm not sure if you understood correctly what a Bounded Context is and how they might communicate with eachother. Also, domain invariants must be nontrivially restatedmaintained for each bounded context which is errorprone Theres usually just one context that have data ownership and that context shall be responsible for invariants involving its own data. For instance, imagine a company that sells goods on Internet. They might have an Inventory context where products gets maintained and a Shopping context that listen to newly available products from the Inventory.p blockquote  p  plalxp  blockquote   pIm not very much arguing against current ddd techniques, so Im not choosing excellent examples against them. Im more interested in this alternative arrangement which I intuit would be more natural and advanced than current ddd techniques. Ive seen data models that are extremely intertwined and dont offer obvious boundaries perhaps poorly designed, OK. I expect that this way could be boundaryless AND more performant.p blockquote  p  uosp  blockquote   pIf there was a rule that a Product name couldnt contain the word propaganda it would be enforced only in the Inventory context. If we were to duplicate invariants of every contexts in every other contexts it would indeed become a maintenance nightmare. p blockquote  p  plalxp  blockquote   pBut you plausibly might have a bounded context centered on Customers and a second bounded context centered on Orders. And maybe the 10,000,000.00 strongLimitstrong I mentioned is made to be a column in strongCustomerstrong and therefore variable, so this business rule can be violated in two ways either by dropping that strongLimitstrong on strongCustomerstrong or increasing totals in strongOrderstrong.  So nontrivially reciprocal rules must check for violations in either bounded context depending on the change.  Our system could decide to skip the assertion if strongPricestrongs and strongLimitstrongs arent changed, which would be pretty slick, no   In the traditional ddd, you might also need some optimized variants for bulk manipulations emAdd an strongOrderstrong of 1000 to every strongCustomeremstrong which could be automatically derived by our new system.p blockquote  p  uosp

Negative 277 pIs it possible to modify the source code of hping3 and install it manually on Ubuntu I want to modify icmp type file to get timestamp in UTC rather than in epoch.Please guide me. Normally when we type sudo hping3 icmpts 12.0.0.1 then it gives us originaterceivesending time with epoch format. I want to see this time in UTC.p
Negative 277 pI added a primary key named locid in locationtable. And in employeetable, I am making locid as foreign key. I am doing it in WAMP with innoDB set in both the tables and ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE is also set.p  pI am inserting a value in locid column of location table but the value I am inserting is not reflecting in employee table eventhough it is set as foreign key in employeetable.p  pExample p  pI am inserting a value 101 as primary key in locid column of locationtable, now I think that since I have made locid column as foreign key with ON UPDATE CASCADE ON in employeetable, value should automatically reflectsshow in locid column of employeetable.p  pCan anyone help me in this   p
