Positive 4183 pI have a windows application where I have a date that when it is changed there is a lot of other things going on or have to be confirmed. So my goal is to have a wizard popup when they select the date to walk the user through the process. I dont want them to be able to change the date on the main form at all. Ill update it through the wizard.p  pCurrently Im calling the wizard on codeEntercode of the codeDateTimePickercode. Im open to changing that if there is a better option but they have to actually select the field not just hover over it. The problem I have is that when the wizard closes, the focuscursor is still sitting in the date field where the user could potentially change the date. I know I can check the codeKeyPresscode or on codeMouseDowncode to relaunch the wizard, but what I would RATHER do is just move the cursor to another control. p  pI tried codeNewControl.Focuscode and this appears to work, however there are 2 problems with it. p  ol liAccording to MSDN, I should not be trying to change the focus with an Enter event. If COULD cause the application or OS to stop responding. li liWhen I cancel the wizard it Enters the control a second time triggering the popup and when it is cancelled a second time it leaves the calendar open or part of the date highlighted depending on who the user entered the field.li ol  pIm open to all suggestions for a better way to do this. p
Positive 4183 pI have a custom codeUICollectionViewCellcode in my tvOS app. It has a codeUIImageViewcode and some codeUILabelcodes in it.

Elevation and responding to user movement on the touchpad. p  pIm aware of codeUIImageViewcodes codeadjustsImageWhenAncestorFocusedcode property, but that only elevates the image in my cell, not the entire cell.p  pIs there a way to make tvOS apply the seemingly standard focus appearancebehavior to my custom view or do I have to do it all manuallyp  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 4183 pA button in a website triggers a popup menu when clicked only when clicked, and not when hovered over. I want to be able to inspect this popup menu but after I right click it and select Inspect Element, it disappears so I can no longer inspect it.p  pWhen the popup menu is displayed, I can see that an entry for it appears in the HTML in the Inspector tab but when I click the entry, the popup menu disappears an so does the HTML entry. p  pFor cases in which a menu appears when a button is hovered over not clicked I would click an entry in the Inspector tab to switch focus to it, then I would just hover over the button and use the arrow keys to navigate to the entry in the Inspector tab. But since this button needs to be clicked, then I lose the focus on the Inspector tab.p  pI thought this could be solved by switching the focus to the Inspector tab in Firefoxs Web Tools without clicking anything.p  pIve tried using different shortcuts such as CtrlShiftC or CtrlShiftI opens the Web Tool but I havent been able to switch the focus to the the Inspector tab to navigate through the HTML after using these shortcuts.p  pIve also tried using inspect mode the button left of the Inspector tab, which lets me inspect anything I click. The problem with this method is that to get to the menu I need to click a button first and inspect mode only inspect the first thing I click. Maybe theres a way to ignore the first click while on inspect modep  pEDITbr Pressing the TAB key numerous times, sometimes focuses on the Inspector tab. Sometimes it just loops through the elements in the website and never focuses on the Inspector tab. Even so, the times I was able to use TAB to focus on the Inspector tab, the popup menu disappeared after pressing TAB about 20 times so I need a different method that doesnt use the TAB key.p

Positive 4183 pi have a main window that contains multiple UserControls, arranged as tab pages and tab groups much like Visual Studio allows to have two or more editors visible at the same time. p  pI also have the possibility to open such an UserControl into a seperate floating window.p  pOne of these UserControls contains simple form fields e.g. text boxes. These text boxes are bounded with common databinding to an object  property. The binding mode is OnValidation not on OnPropertyChanged. p  pWhen I switch the focus from this User Control inside the main window into another UserControl in the Main windows, the validation is automatically performed and the databinding is finised  the changed text will be set on the model object  property that is bounded to that text field.p  pBut if I switch the focus to an UserControl which resides in another floating window, the databinding is not finished since no validation is performed.p  pI know that I can handle this manually by triggering ValidateChildren etc, but this seems to my the wrong way  is ugly. p  pIs there a correct  clean way to solve this issue I want that the validation is performed as soon as the UserControl loses its focus or the window gets deactivated. p  pOne information On of my UserControls contains a TreeControl. If I edit a tree node label, and when I switch the focus to another foating window, the label edit is finished automatically.

Negative 4183 pIm having a general discussion with one of my developers about philosophy of structuring TSQL stored procedures. p  pLets make a couple assumptions to avoid responses along the line of dont put business logic in SPs, etcp  ol liBusiness Logic can be in SPsli liThere is no standard scripted layer of CRUD SPs li liComplex procedures are executed in single scope within an SPli liDynamic SQL is allowedli ol  pEssentially my coworker has hit his head against the SQL Server wall of nested inserts in SQL Server. You can nest them beyond a single level. p  pi.e. p  ul lipPROC C is called by PROC B, the results of which are INSERTED into a temp table X and operations are performed and then a result set is returnedpli lipPROC B is called by PROC A, the results our original final select from PROC C  Transformations of which are INSERTED into a temp table Z and operations are performed and then a result set is returnedpli ul  pThis results in SQL Server throwing an error saying you cant nest inserts into temp tables. p  pI agree with this logic, assuming our four original premises, it would then simply be permissible to include the logic executed in PROC C directly in PROC B. p  pMy coworker however feels, being a good Object Orientated encapsulator, that by encapsulating the final nested insert the code is more maintainable. p  pI on the other hand feel that encapsulating code into CRUD operations, which use temp tables, is fundamentally opposed to the declarative and procedural approach to data management inherent in SQL and relational databases. p  pUltimately, his argument is that if the logic was simply in one SP, then should the table schema change, all SPs addressing the table would have to change. A valid point, however I feel that is unlikely as once our development has bedded down tables are not subject to adhoc change. p  pMy argument is that by encapsulating temp table inserts, for use in nth degree nesting if possible  thankfully its not, would result in a case in which all SPs which call that encapsulated procedure or should we now rather call it a method would have to be retested anyway in the event that the centralized encapsulated procedure changes, since unless its outputs are the same, it may well result in a break in the calling parent SP.  p  pI suppose my ultimate question is this, fundamentally is TSQL a declarative, a procedural or an imperative language. In my opinion it is clearly a mixture  I suppose if I had to create the recipe Id sayp  p10 Declarative since in principle its declarative 70 Procedural In our case, the case in which business processes are in procs 20 Imperative Imperative constructs exist  esp. in newer SQL Server versionsp  phr p  pp.s. At the moment hes suggesting using OUTPUT parameter in the SP call, rather thanp  pinsert into temp  exec spInsertUpdateTablep  pI have a whole other dislike for OUTPUT parameters, but I suppose that might have to fly.

Negative 4183 pWhile certain guidelines state that you should use an interface when you want to define a contract for a class where inheritance is not clear codeIDomesticatedcode and inheritance when the class is an extension of another codeCat  Mammalcode, codeSnake  Reptilecode, there are cases when in my opinion these guidelines enter a gray area.p  pFor example, say my implementation was codeCat  Petcode. codePetcode is an abstract class. Should that be expanded to codeCat  Mammal, IDomesticatedcode where codeMammalcode is an abstract class and codeIDomesticatedcode is an interface Or am I in conflict with the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKISS5FprincipleKISSaa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiYAGNIYAGNIa principles even though Im not sure whether there will be a codeWolfcode class in the future, which would not be able to inherit from codePetcodep  pMoving away from the metaphorical codeCatcodes and codePetcodes, lets say I have some classes that represent sources for incoming data. They all need to implement the same base somehow. I could implement some generic code in an abstract codeSourcecode class and inherit from it. I could also just make an codeISourcecode interface which feels more right to me and reimplement the generic code in each class which is less intuitive. Finally, I could have the cake and eat it by making both the abstract class and the interface. Whats bestp  pThese two cases bring up points for using only an abstract class, only an interface and using both an abstract class and an interface. Are these all valid choices, or are there rules for when one should be used over anotherp  phr p  pId like to clarify that by using both an abstract class and an interface that includes the case when they essentially represent the same thing codeSourcecode and codeISourcecode both have the same members, but the class adds generic functionality while the interface specifies the contract.p  pAlso worth noting is that this question is mostly for languages that do not support multiple inheritance such as .NET and Java.p

Negative 4183 pBasically I have to use a random function that can return a number between 0 and 2161.p  pI am trying to make use of this and generate lets say, 6 intervals between 1 and 6 thinking of dice poker. Basically use that one number that is randomly generated for me I can specify range only and preferably only have to call it once. Then take that number and split it into 6 dices where the values will be between 16.p  pI am a bit unsure of the technique one would use, one thing that comes to mind is bit masking but I am unsure if this is the right context. p  pFrom a binary point of view then its reasonable to have the dice values between 05. That would give us the binary number 000101. Now a max value of the random function return would be 101101101101101101 six dices, each being 6 and in decimal it means the upper bound on the random int return would be 187245. The lower bound would be 0. Now lets say the random function returns us the number 66508, making it into binary form we get 010000001111001100 and thats not good enough In this case one of the dices would be 111  7 and we cant get that when the interval is supposed to be 05 16 p  pI need to figure out a way a decimal within the limit range can contain six dices with the values 16 05 but I am in some need of assistance.p

Negative 4183 pI know there are a few similar questions, but I dont think they really have the same requirements as mine.p  pOur DLL is compiled with Visual Studio 2005 and strongmuststrong link with a specific version of the CRT, due to installation constraints. This is absolute, recompiling it with the latest version is not a solution.p  pWe recently updated our Boost libraries. However, when I built Boost, it automatically used the latest CRT. Now, when I link Boost with our program, it creates a dependency on both the newest wrong version of the CRT and the old correct version of the CRT. The dependency on the newest version needs to go.p  pWhat is the best solution to this problem At the moment, the best I can think of is rebuilding Boost using the old version, but I have no idea how to easily do that without modifying the source.p  pIf there were a way to force Visual Studio to use a specific version of the CRT globally not on a perproject basis, that would be great. Or a way to just plain remove the newest version of the CRT, but Im pretty sure thats not possible since I think its considered part of the OS.p

Negative 4183 pMy question is not about a specific code snippet but more general, so please bear with me p  pHow should I organize the data Im analyzing, and which tools should I use to manage itp  pIm using python and numpy to analyse data. Because the python documentation indicates that dictionaries are very optimized in python, and also due to the fact that the data itself is very structured,  I stored it in a deeply nested dictionary.p  pHere is a skeleton of the dictionary the position in the hierarchy defines the nature of the element, and each new line defines the contents of a key in the precedent levelp  precode[AS091209M02] [AS091209M01] [AS090901M06] ...

I can analyze the full data set pretty quickly and the dictionary is far too small to fill up my computers ram  half a gig.p  pMy problem comes from the cumbersome manner in which I need to program the operations of the dictionary. I often have stretches of code that go like thisp  precodefor mk in dic.keys     for rgk in dic[mk].keys         for nk in dic[mk][rgk].keys             for ik in dic[mk][rgk][nk].keys                 for ek in dic[mk][rgk][nk][ik].keys                     do something codepre  pwhich is ugly, cumbersome, non reusable, and brittle need to recode it for any variant of the dictionary.p  pI tried using recursive functions, but apart from the simplest applications, I ran into some very nasty bugs and bizarre behaviors that caused a big waste of time it does not help that I dont manage to debug with pdb in ipython when Im dealing with deeply nested recursive functions. In the end the only recursive function I use regularly is the followingp  precodedef dicExplorerdic, depth  1, stp  0     prints the hierarchy of a dictionary.     if depth not specified, will explore all the dictionary          if depth  stp  0 return     try  listkeys  dic.keys     except AttributeError return     stp  1     for key in listkeys         else print sgt [s] stp  , key         dicExplorerdic[key], depth, stp codepre  pI know Im doing this wrong, because my code is long, noodly and nonreusable. I need to either use better techniques to flexibly manipulate the dictionaries, or to put the data in some database format sqlite. My problem is that since Im badly selftaught in regards to programming, I lack practical experience and background knowledge to appreciate the options available. Im ready to learn new tools SQL, object oriented programming, whatever it takes to get the job done, but I am reluctant to invest my time and efforts into something that will be a dead end for my needs.p  pSo what are your suggestions to tackle this issue, and be able to code my tools in a more brief, flexible and reusable mannerp  pAddendum apart of doing something with a particular subdictionary of the data dictionary, here are some examples of operations I implemented for the dataset dic, or a sub dictionary of itp  pactually I have some recursive functions that worked wellp  precodedef normalizeSeqDicdic, normdic  , legend       returns a normalized dictionary from a seqampdic.

Negative 4183 pWould like some advice from this. I got a table where I want to keep track of an object and a list of keys related to the object. Examplep  precodeOBJECTID   ITEMTYPE   ITEMKEY        1          1          THE 1          1          BROWN 1          2          APPLE 1          3          ORANGE 2          2          WINDOW codepre  pBoth OBJECTID and ITEMKEY have high selectivity i.e. the OBJECTID and ITEMKEY are very varied. My access are two waysp  ul lipBy OBJECTID Each time an object changes, the list of key changes so a key is needed based on OBJECTID. Changes happen frequently.pli lipBy ITEMKEY This is for keyword searching and also happens frequently.pli ul  pSo I probably need two keys, and choose one for clustered index the one that is more frequently accessed, or where I want the speed to be, for now lets assume i will prioritize OBJECTID for clustered. What I am confused about is how I should design it. p  pMy questions is, which is better p  pa A Clustered index of OBJECTID,ITEMTYPE,ITEMKEY, and then an index of ITEMKEY. My concern is that since a clustered index is so big 2 ints, 1 string the index will be big, because all index items got to point back to the clustered key.p  pb Create a new column with a running identity DIRECTORYID integer as primary key and clustered index, and declare two index for OBJECTID,ITEMTYPE,ITEMKEY and just ITEMKEY. This will minimize index space but have higher lookup costs.p  pc A Clustered index of OBJECTID,ITEMTYPE,ITEMKEY, and a materialized view of ITEMKEY,ITEMTYPE,OBJECTID on it. My logic is that this is avoids a key lookup and will still be just as big as the index with a lookup in a, at cost of higher overhead.p  pd Err...maybe there is a better way given the requirementsp  pThanks in advance, Andrewp
Negative 4183 pI have a Java application that needs to connect via sockets to two different servers on two separate machines.  One server has been configured to listen on IPv4 connections, while the other has been configured to listen on IPv6 connections.p  pNow, assuming host1 is the machine name of the server listening on IPv4 connections, while host2 is the machine name of the server listening on IPv6 connections.  I need to get an codeInet4Addresscode for host1 and an codeInet6Addresscode for host2 to create a socket connection to each server, such as the followingp  precodeInet4Address inet4  Inet4AddressInetAddress.getByNamehost1 InetSocketAddress soc4  new InetSocketAddressinet4, 7777 ...  Inet6Address inet6  Inet6AddressInetAddress.getByNamehost2 InetSocketAddress soc6  new InetSocketAddressinet6, 7777 ... codepre  pHowever, the JVM by default prefers to use IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses for backward compatibility reasons.  So, in the above code, the first attempt to connect to host1 succeeds, but the second attempt to connect to host2 fails because codeInetAddress.getByNamehost2code returns an codeInet4Addresscode instead of codeInet6Addresscode.p  pI understand that I can set the system property codejava.net.preferIPv6Addressescode to true to prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4, but this in turn causes the second attempt to connect to host2 succeeds, but the first attempt to connect to host1 failed because codeInetAddress.getByNamehost1code returns an codeInet6Addresscode instead of codeInet4Addresscode.p  pThe system property codejava.net.preferIPv6Addressescode is only being read once see InetAddress line 212218 and so it would have no effects even if I change its value back to false after setting it to true.p  pSo what I can I do in this case  This seems like a common problem, so surely there has to be a way already to do it.p  pNote that I can of course use codeInetAddress.getByAddresscode and supply each machines IP address explicitly instead to get back an codeInet4Addresscode and codeInet6Addresscode, but I do not want to do this unless I really have to.  So other solutions please.p  pOh, I am using java 1.6.019 in case it matters.p  pThanksp

Negative 4183 pThere are times when a programmer clearly has made a deliberate choice in their code structure that results in behaviour that is at best unintuitive but not technically a bug in that its broken.  Should this be classified as a bug and fixed p  pFor example, a wellknown open source ecommerce system if you look at my answer history, youll work out which one provides functionality for Quantity Increments where an administrator can specify the multiple of units that must added to the cart e.g. must be 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.  The code is written so that these limits are only enforced when the system is in Manage Stock mode i.e. inventory levels are decremented with each order.  Now, it is an entirely valid situation that a store owner may wish to sell their product in specified increments, but not manage stock levels. The code ignores the configuration silently no feedback to the admin and theres no documentation of the requirement for Manage Stock to be turned on. p  pIs this a bug  Or just poor designdocumentation.  p  pNote, Im sure that some readers will interpret this question as subjective, but I think there is an important different between bugs and poor design. This is particularly relevant in open source projects where bug reporting tends to work in different processes than internal company systems. p

Negative 4183 pHi Im pretty new to Python and to NLP. I need to implement a perceptron classifier. I searched through some websites but didnt find enough information. For now I have a number of documents which I grouped according to categorysports, entertainment etc. I also have a list of the most used words in these documents along with their frequencies. On a particular website there was stated that I must have some sort of a decision function accepting arguments x and w. x apparently is some sort of vector  i dont know what w is. But I dont know how to use the information I have to build the perceptron algorithm and how to use it to classify my documents. Have you got any ideas Thanks p

Negative 4183 pI am working on an application which is using WPF, MVVM, Prism, and MEF.p  pI am using a combination of navigation with request navigate, controllers with view management using region manager, and eventing via event aggregator to run the application in a single window.  Im using a view first approach similar to how the Stock Trader RI works. This works great when any view model code that would interact with the UI busy indicator is kicked off by the user, but when it is started behind the scenes there can be problems.p  pI know this may seem like a poor implementation, but I think I have a valid scenario.  My particular example has to do with login.  p  pCurrently the application starts and loads the shell.  The login view is loaded into the main content region of the shell.  When the user clicks login a busy indicator is shown and the client application services login is executed.  When the login is complete, the busy indicator goes away, and the screen is navigated to the users home screen.p  pThis works well because the navigation login and navigation are initiated by the user clicking the login button.  p  pSo now I have a new requirement that a user can select Auto Login on the login form, such that the next time the user starts the app, the login view will not show up and login will happen behind the scenes.p  pNow if I just want to call the auto login feature, there is no problem, this by itself has no UI interaction and will work fine.  But login takes a few seconds and I want to display my busy indicator.p  pThe problem is where do I initiate the auto login call  The shell view model constructor  The shell view model PartImportsSatisfied implementation  In any of these places, the shell view which contains my busy indicator isnt really loaded yet.  As a result, none of the resources I need, like regions and region managers arent available. So what might be a good way for me to implement thisp  pCheck if previous user should auto login got this part figured outp  precode If yes then   Show busy indicator   Attempt to auto login   If auto login was success    Hide busy indicator    Navigate to user home screen   Else    Hide busy indicator    Navigate to login screen  Else   Hide busy indicator   Navigate to the login screen codepre  pAny ideas are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4183 pI apologize in advance for my longwinded question and if the formatting isnt up to par newbie, here goes.p  pI have a table MYTABLE with the following schema  p  pre  MYID  TYPE  RECCOUNT  1      A     1  1      B     3  2      A     0  2      B     0  .... pre  pThe first column corresponds to an ID, the second is some type and 3rd some count. NOTE that the MYID column is not the primary key, there could be many records having the same MYID.p  pI want to write a stored procedure which will take an array of IDs and return the subset of them that match the following criteria  the ID should match the MYID field of at least 1 record in the table and at least 1 matching record should not have TYPE  A OR RECCOUNT  0.p  pThis is the procedure I came up with  p  precodePROCEDURE getidsubset     iIds IN IDARRAY,     oMatchingIds OUT NOCOPY IDARRAY  IS BEGIN SELECT t.columnvalue BULK COLLECT INTO oMatchingIds FROM TABLECASTiIds AS IDARRAY t WHERE EXISTS      SELECT  NLSJ  1     FROM MYTABLE m     WHERE m.myid  t.columnvalue     AND m.type  A OR m.reccount  0  END getidsubset codepre  pBut I really care about performance and some IDs could match 1000s of records in the table. There is an index on the MYID and TYPE column but no index on the RECCOUNT column. So I was thinking if there are more than 1000 rows that have a matching MYID field then Ill just return the ID without applying the TYPE and RECCOUNT predicates. Heres this version  p  precodePROCEDURE getidsubset         iIds IN IDARRAY,         oMatchingIds OUT NOCOPY IDARRAY  IS BEGIN SELECT t.columnvalue BULK COLLECT INTO oMatchingIds FROM TABLECASTiIds AS IDARRAY t, MYTABLE m WHERE m.myid  t.columnvalue AND  SELECT COUNTm.myid FROM m WHERE 1 gt 1000     OR EXISTS m.type  F OR m.reccount  0  END getidsubset codepre  pBut this doesnt compile, I get the following error on the inner select  p  pPLSQL ORA00936 missing expressionp  pIs there another way of writing this The inner select needs to work on the joined table.p  pAnd to clarify, Im OK with the result set being different for this query. My assumption is that since there is an index on the myid column, doing count would be much cheaper than actually applying the reccount predicate to 10000s of rows since there is no index on that column. Am I wrongp
Negative 4183 pI have a table where each row is part of a New Zealand map.

Negative 4183 pI have recently become aware that I have no idea, genericly speaking, how a cc compiler works.  I will admit this initialy came from trying to understand header guards but came to the realization that I am lacking in how compiling works.p  pTake Visual C for instance  Theres the Header Files folder, the Resources Files folder, and Source Files folder.  Is there any significance to the separation of these folders and what you put in them  To me, they are all source files.  Take the code snippetsp  h1Snippet 1h1  precodea1.h int r4 codepre  pand p  precodea1.cpp int b  ltsemicolon left out on purpose codepre  pandp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include a1.h void main     cout ltlt r  codepre  pThe compiler errors out saying a1.cpp3  fatal error C1004 unexpected endoffile found where I would expect it wouldnt because the a1.cpp file is not included where the main method exists where in the next code snippetp  h1Snippet 2h1  precodea1.h int r4 ltsemicolon left out on purpose codepre  pand p  precodea1.cpp int b  4   codepre  pandp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt void main     cout ltlt b  codepre  pErrors out because main.cpp6  error C2065 b  undeclared identifier.  If you include the a1.cpp like sop  h1Snippet 3h1  precodea1.h int r4 ltsemicolon left out on purpose codepre  pand p  precodea1.cpp int b  4   codepre  pandp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include a1.cpp void main     cout ltlt b  codepre  pthe compiler complains a1.obj  error LNK2005 int b b3HA already defined in main.obj.  Both snippets 2 and 3 ignore the fact that codeint r  4code does not have a semicolon missing as I suspect that it has something to do with its a xxxx.h file. If I remove the a1.cpp file from the project on snippet 1, then it compiles fine. Clearly what I have expected is not what I am getting.  Theres plenty of books and tutorials on how to code in cpp, but not much in the way cpp handles files and source code in the complition process.  What on earth is going on herep

Negative 4183 pWe have received a WSDL from our client that we use to communicate with their service.  I have made a service reference to it in our project, and had developed the code to interact with it.

I would like to build more robust testing that would validate what i pass in and send...li liDynamic reply messages. From what I understand, you can define a set of reply messages in SoapUI and one will be randomly selected.  I really need to be able to parse the input and send a reply specific to some of that data.  It wouldnt have to be fully developed but it would be a big step in actually emulating the clients service.li ul  pIs there a better way that I should be doing this testing  Is there a Visual Studio tool I am unaware of  Should I be trying to create my own testing service that serves the same endpoints as the clients service and implement custom code for testing  Should I learn SoapUI better and possibly address some of my issues with it  p  pPlease let me know, my coworker assumes that microsoft has a better way to test this kind of scenario.

Negative 4183 pI need to store significant amounts of rich text in a SQL database, retrieve it and display it.p  pOne font throughout is OK but I need different font sizesboldcolors.p  pFor now I am using a RichTextBox WPF to display it, and XamlWriter.SaveXamlReader.Parse to serialize it to strings to store in the DB. It works well but the RichTextBox is so HUGELY SLOW at displaying the text that its basically unusable.p  pIs there a quick way to do this with acceptable performancep  pIm considering doing it with GlyphRun objects, drawing each character as a bitmap and computing all the alignment requirements to fit the destination image etc... But reinventing the wheel on simple coloredsizable text seems really strange in 2011.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks for the answers, didnt see them until now, sorry.p  pText is entered by the user from codeRichTextBoxcodees as well, basically I just save the resulting codestringcode codeXamlWriter.SaverichTextBox.Documentcode in the database. Other fields doubleint etc are also entered by the user from codeTextBoxcodees.p  pAs the user queries the database, pages of readonly rich text with colors and formatting is generated from scratch using the fields in the database, including the saved rich text fields above these are converted from codeFlowDocumentcodes to codeSpancodes and some replacement is done on them codeInlineUIContainercodes which host a class derived from codeUIElementcode which references a database entry, inlined in the text, like see [thisbook] where [thisbook] references some database entrys ID. MSDN says all that is far too much text for a codeTextBlockcode.p  pThat text rendering is the really slow part but there is no way around it, I need that formatting and its just how the WPF codeRichTextBoxcodees are even when entering a little simple text in the codeRichTextBoxcodees, there is a delay between typing and the character appearing on the screen...p  pFor now I still use codeRichTextBoxcodees but I keep lots of rendered layouts in memory the codeParagraphcodecodeSectioncodecodeSpancode objects and I am careful to rerender only the least amount of formatted text possible when changesqueries are made or different views of the database data are requested by the user.p  pIts still not fast but its OK, changing the whole structure AvalonEdit or codeFormattedTextcode or codeGlyphRuncode doesnt seem worth it right now, too much work, the whole serialization API with codeXamlWriter.Savecode and codeXamlReader.Parsecode simplifies much for codeFormattedTextcode and codeGlyphRuncode, Id have to come up with a file format myself to save the formatted text to the database.p  pThere is also the possibility of using the OpenXML SDK to create Microsoft Word .docx documents but google says rendering performance isnt great either, and I dont know if embedding an codeUIElementcode in the text within an codeInlineUIContainercode and serializing that to be saved in the database would be possible same problem with AvalonEdit.p

Negative 4183 pWe have a single page application which loads all content through ajax calls to different web services. The start page is loaded only once and then depending on the user actions different containers are updated with html packages we prerender on the server.p  pNow we have a problem that we spotted when the application is running for long periods without restarting.

But if you run this test application you can see some different behaviour between fetching data with jQuery ajax and asp.net ajax, at least in IE9. Chrome seems to be equal but in IE9, when you fetch data with jQuery it does not consumes that lot of memory but in the other case with asp.net ajax it grows and never releases the memory.p  pI have several question here. First, what is the difference Are there perfomance losses when using asp.net ajax And second is there a memory leak in my javascript code This is usually the pattern we use throughout the application in a simplified example. If there is something wrong we need to know that and correct that. Is this memory consumption a likely reason to the problem I have a lot of memory in my developer computer so the browser maybe never releasing the memory because it doesnt have to Maybe this is false alarm and the problem is something else. The usual reason when a browser seems unresponsive is the CPU going high but this is not the case here.p  pAppreciate any help or new viewpoint on the problem. Thanks.p

Negative 4183 pI am currently working on a GUI software project for visualizing 3D scenes using Qt. The GUI allows user to load batches of 3D data files such as .obj with some .mtl support and .stl as well as 2D image files into the scene as SceneObjectclass objects which is rendered on a QGLWidgetderived widget.p  pWhen I load them in batches on the main GUI thread however, the long loading time causes the GUI to freeze, which is ugly. I have tried performing the loading on a separate thread but there is one big catch when loading .obj textures or image files, I will also perform binding using OpenGL glBindtexture immediately after loading each image or texture so that I only need to save texture IDs in each SceneObject instance. When I tried to perform the load in a worker thread, the whole program would just crash.p  pI have read that each thread can only access one OGL context and context switching across threads is one but dangerous way to achieve what I wanted to do. Another possible way would be to perform texture binding on the GUI thread after loading is completed but that would mean a complete redesign on my SceneObject class p  pCan anyone give me some advice on how to implement a loading thread for loading assets into a OpenGL scenep

The SSL certificate is good for .myhost.com.p  ol lipI dont know a lot about SSL, but Im assuming this means that the data between site users and ANY domain on myhost.com is encrypted. So was curious if this meant that if someone else on the same host as me somehow intercepted the data from my site would they be able to view it, since they would also have a a hrefhttpstheirdomain.myhost.com relnofollowhttpstheirdomain.myhost.coma address, which uses the same SSL certificate I may have no idea at all, and this was pretty much a guess.pli lipIf HTTPS is used on a login page, but after logging in the other pages are viewed over HTTP, is this a security issuepli lipIs there any way to show a web form via HTTP for bots like Google, but have real users redirected to the HTTPS version Would be ideal if this could be done via .htaccess. I currently have some rewrite rules that redirect certain pages to HTTPS, but the rest as HTTP. So if a visitor visits the contact form they get the HTTPS version automatically, but it automatically switches back to HTTP for pages that dont contain forms. So, via htaccess, is there a way to direct real users to the HTTPS version, but have bots directed to the HTTP version I would like these pages to still be indexed by the search engines, but would like users to see it via HTTPS.pli ol  pThanks in advance for any help you can provide.p

Negative 4183 pRan across a weird problem with my WCF references this morning. In a nutshell, I have a duplex service set up so that a server can notify a client by sending objects in a data contract. When a client connects, it runs a function on the server to return a codeListOf NewItemcode based on whats in the shared queue of the service class. The trouble is, when I update my service reference in the client, it says the function returns a codeNewItemcode object, not a codeListOf NewItemcode object. I can go into the reference and manually change it to a codeListcode object and itll transfer just fine. Any ideas why the service reference generator would arbitrarily change my return typep  pHeres the relevant codep  precodeltServiceContract     CallbackContractGetTypeINotifyCallback,     SessionModeServiceModel.SessionMode.Requiredgt Public Interface INotifyService     ltOperationContractgt     Function GetNewServerItems As ListOf NewItem End Interface  ltDataContractgt ltSerializablegt Public Class NewItem     ltDataMembergt     Public Property ItemNum As String      ltDataMembergt     Public Property Timestamp As DateTime End Class  ltServiceBehavior     ConcurrencyModeServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single,     InstanceContextModeServiceModel.InstanceContextMode.Singlegt Public Class NotifyService     Implements INotifyService      Shared serveritems As New ListOf NewItem      Public Function GetNewServerItems As ListOf NewItem         Return serveritems     End Function End Class codepre  pAnd in Reference.vb simplifiedp  precodeltSystem.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttributeActionhttptempuri.orgINotifyServiceGetNewServerItems, ReplyActionhttptempuri.orgINotifyServiceGetNewServerItemsResponsegt   Function GetNewServerItems As NotifyGateway.NewItem codepre

Negative 4183 pIm building a few REST web services and Im facing an interesting issue..p  pIve built some error handling so that when the server throws a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, a JSON payload is still provided instead of the default error page on a browser.

Negative 4183 pThere is nice tool in Visual Studio 2008 called text visualizer which allows to visualize variables that contain some kind of text. In my program this is an OpenGL shader program that is being constructed at the run time. However text visualizer is a modal window and blocks all other actions, which includes stepping over the program, until closed.p  pIs there a way to continue to debug the program and keep the text visualizer open to be able to watch changes made to the text Is there some free plugin that does thatp

Negative 4183 pI need some advice for those who are experienced making Android applications.  What I would really like to have, for my applications appearance at the top, a titlebar which is a ImageView content is a png, and at the bottom a series of custom buttons which make up a tabbar like thing.  In between the title and the tabbar is the Content, which may be anything...  most likely buttonsp  pI have been doing this by making a RelativeLayout which specifies LeftMargin and UpperMargin for x,y coordinates Currently all of my activities are inheriting a custom MyActivity class, which rebuilds the title and the tabbar at the time of onCreate.  This seems bad to mep  pPART1 A solution to Persistent data Since the tabbar and the title are persistent no matter what screen youre on during this applications runtime, it makes the most sense to store them somewhere...  How should I do this Make a singleton object that the Activitys ask forbr    I thought a little about the singleton object, and Im not even sure what I would store, since the Views that are on displayed during Activity A have activity A as context, and not Activity B.p  pPART2 Animation Aesthetics I would really like to have the Content the view in the middle between title and tabbar slide out to the left, and the new content slide in from the right.  I.e, Id like the tabbar and the title to remain fixed while the activities change.  is this at all possible  What should I do to achieve itp  pone idea I had, was to make all of the program in one activity  I would create an animation for the Custom View in the middle, and I would override the back button to navigate correctly to the previous Custom View.

Negative 4183 pSometime ago, I cloned an application on github and ran it locally to look at it. It was a ruby application running on rack. The port I used to view it was localhost9292.p  pFast forward to today. I am trying to run a very simple rack application I wrote. Just a one liner basically to study rack. When I go to localhost9292, the old application I downloaded before comes up in my browser. I have no idea why this is happening and since I dont need the app, I closed everything and deleted that old application from my computer. I then tried localhost9292 again, and oddly, that same application came up. p  pEven when I dont run anything, rack or otherwise, any time I go to localhost9292, I get that ghost application showing up. Ive tried clearing the cache and killing rack, restarting firefox, etc. This happens only on Firefox. Only when I use another browser do I get the proper response on localhost9292. So I guess this has to do with Firefox somehow tying that port to that other application.p  pMy question is how do I clear this application from Firefox And what is the mechanism by which Firefox would tie a port to one application for months literally after I ran it. I dont believe this is happening from rack as I suppose I could just keep using another browser but Id really just like to know what is happening to cause this. Ive been searching around for this for hours and can find nothing.p

Negative 4183 pI currently use Flite tts in my app and the male voice works just fine. But my client wants the female voice to work just as well. There is a notorious difference between the processing times in both voices Female stl Voice has a delay of 2 seconds more than the default voice. The other obstacle is that the TTS has to work offline so DragonMobile and iSpeech are not an option.  In your opinions, whats the best TTS library with small delays for iOS Has anybody seen a newermodified version of flite 1.4 I realize I either find an optimized version for Flite or change my library.  I have been looking at different posts and most of them are from a long time so Im hoping something new and better is out there.  Thanks.p

Negative 4183 pI currently have a calculation structure in my rails app that has models codemetriccode, codeoperandcode and codeoperationtypecode.p  pPresently, the codemetriccode model has many codeoperandscode, and can perform calculations based on the codeoperationtypecode e.g. sum, multiply, etc., and each codeoperandcode is defined as being right or left i.e. so that if the operation is division, the numerator and denominator can be identified.p  pPresently, an operand is always an attribute of some model, e.g. codecustomer.sales.sellingprice.sumcode.p  pIn order to make this scalable, in need to allow an operand to be emeitherem an attribute of some kind, or the results of a previous operation, i.e. an operand can be a metric.p  pI have included a diagram of how my models currently lookp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV8EEf.png altenter image description herep  pCan anyone assist me with the most elegant way of allowing an operand to be an actual operand, or another metricp  pThanksp  pEDIT It seems based on the only answer so far that perhaps polymorphic associations are the way to go on this, but the answer is so brief I have no idea how they could be used in this way  can anyone elaboratep  pEDIT 2 OK, I think Im getting somewhere  essentially i presently have a metric, which hasmany operands, and an operand hasmany metrics. I need a polymorphic self join, where a metric can also have many metrics  do I need to call this something else, perhaps calculatedmetrics, so that the metric model can use itself That would leave me with a situation where a metric hasmany operands, and a metric has many calculatedmetrics.p  pEDIT 3 I have updated my models as below, and would appreciate any critiques regarding whether this is a good way to approach the problem. You will note that I have added a model called codecalculatedmetriccode that is essentially a holder for other metrics  i.e. a metric can be calculated using two operands, or a combination of an operand and a calculatedmetric.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzrNXl.png altRevised Modelp  pEDIT 4 Bounty added for anyone who can show me a detailed railsy way of doing this.p  pEDIT 5 Bounty is still up for grabs while the answer provided below is detailed, I am looking for the best way to do this, rather than alternative ways to approach the issue i.e. please let me know the best way to tackle the issue, rather than looking for ways to sidestep it, as I need this functionality. Thanksp  pEdit 6 Not getting much attention on this  would an increased bounty help, or is this question just not a runner p

Negative 4183 pIn our online contest system, there is a frequently changing table codestandingscode with integer columns codeuserid, scorecode. Both are indexed with a unique constraint. Two kinds of queries are requiredp  ol liGiven a codescorecode not in the table, return the 1based position that the score would occupy if it were inserted. li liGiven a codeuseridcode in the table, return the position of the corresponding score.li ol  pIn both cases, position is with respect to score ascending a new score smaller than all currently in the table will have position 1.p  pHeres the tough part we probably cant afford a table scan. The table may have up to 10 million records, and we need to handle at least 40 queries per second.p  pHow to do this in PostgreSQLp  pI have a nonSQL solution in Berkeley DB that uses its logical record numberenabled Btrees. It easily has good enough performance. But we would like to get rid of the BDB by reimplementing with a PostgreSQL query. I have tried the obviousp  precodeselect 1count from standings where score lt  limit 1 codepre  pThis causes a table scan.p  pI expect the answer to be no way because the logical record number facility of BDB requires locking the entire BTree for each edit. To get Olog N performance, it relies on leaf counts in each node. All these counts in the path to root must change with every edit hence, the locking. Such locking is against the design principles of PostgreSQL and probably any multiuser database.  p  pSo if the problem cant be solved with PostgreSQL, confirmation of this is the next best result of this question.p

Negative 4183 pI am having some challenges trying to use JQM and MVVM. I am also trying to use knockout.js too.p  pFor example, currently I am trying to implement a navigation similar to the iOS page controlthe little dots indicating you can swipe to navigate to the next pagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR92FV.png altPage indicatorp  pThe data to be displayed is fetched from the server and it needs to be displayed in JQM pages. So the JQM pages need to be created dynamically.p  pFrom the UI perspective, I plan to use a fixed footer containing the dotsbased on the number of pages.p  pThe problem is with the viewmodel which needs to persist between the JQM pages, as I do not want to load data from the server by page, data is loaded at once and it is expected that the client will display it in pages.p  pI could have a viewmodel holding the data and living throughout the life of the application and just bind each page view to it. Instead, I want to keep the viewmodel alive as long as its really required by the view.p  pThe solution I am thinking is to catch jQueryMobile page navigation events and see if the navigation is between these pages.

What would be the proper procedure to achieve such a thing What classes do I need to use Can I use codeHttpPostcode like in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma41267461174378this examplea If so, how would I construct the codeInputStreamEntitycode for my bitmap I would find it revolting to be required to first store the bitmap in a file on the device.p  hr  pI should also mention that I really need to send every unaltered pixel of the original bitmap to the server, so I cant convert it to JPEG.p

Negative 4183 pIn a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCfFSY relnofollowthis demonstrationa,  I am using an animation effect called Rotate 3d in a hrefhttpricostacruz.comjquery.transit relnofollowjq transita. I expect that, when you mouse over the first box, the boxes will start rotating one after another until all of them are white, and when you mouse out off the container box, they will all change back to black.p  pstrongProblemstrong The problem occurs when you mouse over the first box then out of the container a few times in rapid succession. It seems that the boxes flipping lose their order of rotating and not reset properly to black on mouse off.p  pstrongThings I have triedstrong I have tried playing around with the fx queue but it didnt seem to make much of a difference. I have also tried unbinding the mouse leave while the animations are running and then binding it again after the delay for the last box have passed, but that didnt work either.p  pstrongAnswer Im looking forstrong There are a few ways this can be answered. The first would be how to kill those animations as soon as you mouse out. The second would be how to start the order at the first box every time you mouse out.

Negative 4183 pOn a Rails 3 application we have a highly normalized database schema, which is necessary for multiple reasons.  Additionally, we need to provide some readonly RESTful routes whose virtual resources are derived from the combined denormalized data from several models and we must present the results as a JSON document.p  pFor example, we would have models like State, City, and Neighborhood, each with their own data and associations.  The RESTful resource is the Neighborhood but we always want to include the name of the associated State and City.

The problem is that I cant manage to bind the checked value to the data in the grids datasource, so when I click the save button to save the new information I get the same data I got from the url. Does anybody know how to do this or a simpler way to do it instead of mine Thank youp

Negative 4183 pI am working with a fairly large and complicated codebase I am not familiar with, which uses strongDirectWritestrong for text rendering. I dont know whether if it matters, but this is a WinRT Windows Store application.p  pThe app is strongmulti threadedstrong, and some DirectX calls are done from a background not UI thread. All the strongBeginDrawstrong and strongEndDrawstrong calls are made from the strongUI threadstrong, and some of the strongDrawTextstrong calls are made from strongbackgroundstrong threads. I made sure that none of these calls overlap, and DrawText is only called between BeginDraw and EndDraw pairs.p  pHowever, sometimes I get a strongSEHExceptionstrong when calling the DrawText method. It never happens when it is called from the strongUI threadstrong, only when called from a strongbackgroundstrong thread.br This does not happen on every computer. It very often happens on some, and can not be reproduced at all on others.br The exact message the VS Debugger says is this A first chance exception of type System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException occurred in x.DLL, and it happens when I call the strongID2D1DeviceContext.DrawTextstrong function, and the debugger breaks in the d2d1.h header file at the DrawText call.p  pIs there any way to debug or diagnose what is going wrong when a SEHException is thrown It is clearly connected to calling the DrawText function from a background thread.br And apart from this, are there any general rules of calling DirectX functions from background threads I made sure that the D2D1Factory gets created with D2D1FACTORYTYPEMULTITHREADED option.p

Negative 4183 pIs there any good way to get the remaining memory available to the JVM at run time The use case of this would be to have web services which fail gracefully when they are nearing their memory limits by refusing new connections with a nice error message too many people using this, try again later, rather than dying abruptly with an OutOfMemory error.p  pNote this has nothing to do with calculatingestimating the cost of each object beforehand. In principle I could estimate how much memory my objects take and refuse new connections based on that estimate, but that seems kind of hackyfragile.p

Negative 4183 pGood evening Experts. My requirement is as follows. I am transforming a target message based on materials that shouldnt be passed. If the target message contains certain materials these are to be removed from the target.p  pHowever we are to also check if the target message contains nothing but, strongONLYstrong, these materials then the transformation should not remove these at all.p  pCurrently the code below is to find and remove the materials in question. Please suggest how to ignore the transformation for this new requirement.p  pIm considering the choosewhenotherwise case.p  pMany thanks in advance.p  p p  precodeltxsloutput methodxml indentyesgt     ltxsltemplate matchnodegt         ltxslcopygt             ltxslcopyof selectgt             ltxslapplytemplatesgt         ltxslcopygt     ltxsltemplategt  ltxsltemplate matchE1EDP01[E1EDP19IDTNR 407303]gt ltxsltemplate matchE1EDP01[E1EDP19IDTNR 243]gt ltxsltemplate matchE1EDP01[E1EDP19IDTNR 262]gt ltxsltemplate matchE1EDP01[E1EDP19IDTNR 265]gt ltxsltemplate matchE1EDP01[E1EDP19IDTNR 5624]gt ltxsltemplate matchE1EDP01[E1EDP19IDTNR 145416]gt codepre  pp  pSincere apologies  Sample input has only 2 line items but should still create this output.

Negative 4183 pI have a WCF service that works fine on my local computer hosted in IIS, WIN7. Accessing the service via browser and displaying the WSDL and the included XSDs is no problem.

Negative 4183 pI have a large collection of person names e.g. john smith. I want to look up people by name in it. However, some of the queries will be misspelled e.g. jon smth, johnsm ith. Are there any spelling correction libraries with Python bindings that might find spellingcorrected matches for mep  pIm aware of Whoosh and Pythonaspell. Whooshs spelling correction doesnt quite work for me because it writes the collection of correct spellings to disk rather than storing it in memory. That makes lookups too slow for my application. It doesnt seem to be trivial to change this behavior, because of how the code is structured. Also Whoosh does not weight different characteredits differently even though, say, a y is much more likely to be confused with an i jim kazinsky  jim kazinski than it is a z. p  pAspell doesnt work well with person names, since names typically contain white space  Aspell considers the word to be the fundamental unit of correction. Also, as I understand it, Aspell uses an ngram model of spelling correction, rather than a characteredit distance model. While an ngram model makes sense for dictionary words, it doesnt work as well for names the people bob ruzatoxg and joe ruzatoxg have a lot of rare trigrams in common, since they have the same rare last name. But theyre clearly different people.p  pI should also mention that I cant just compare each query to all of the entries in the collection  that would be too slow. Some index needs to get built beforehand.p  pThanksp

How can I accomplish that Should I start codeclient.phpcode as a service through codemain.phpcode Or should I use the codeclientinputcode function to send a message and then return what it sends, back  However, I wanted that codeclientcode to be running until the use logs out, because other clients may connect to the chat. How can I accomplish that is kind of fuzzy for me. The code in codeclient input code is the same as in codeclient.phpcode.p
Negative 4183 pI am generating a CSV file with PHP and saving it on the hard disk I do not want a download. The database charset is codeutf8generalcicode and there are chars in there like the degrees sign codecode, which show up perfectly in PHPmyadmin. These chars need to be saved in the CSV file. Everything I do is in UTF8, but the file gets saved with the encoding codeISO88591code. If I start using the codeutf8encodecode function, other chars show up codecode when I convert it back to codeUTF8code in excel or any other text editor. I do not know what is going wrong and I have spent hours to track it down, without success.p  pI have tried codeSET NAMES utf8code just to be sure it is codeUTF8code, but that just causes more strange characters and no codeUTF8code encoding. Using MySQLis codesetcharsetcode does the same. With the header as codeContenttypetexthtmlcharsetUTF8code the CSV still does not have utf8 as default encoding, nor with any of these combinations.p  pSome codep  precodeheaderContenttypetexthtmlcharsetUTF8 rMysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, user, pass, database rCSV  fopentest.time..csv, w  aCSVdata  arrayvar1, var2, var3 fputcsvrCSV, aCSVdata, ,,   fcloserCSV codepre  pThat is pretty much all is happening.

Negative 4183 pI  have been advised by an SEO consultant to add the googlesiteverification  meta tag to every page of my site.

An example is a hrefhttpwww.contractsforgeeks.comTechJobsFloridaTampa.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.contractsforgeeks.comTechJobsFloridaTampa.aspxap  pBut I am making the assumption that adding this meta tag will not help the page get indexed.p  pIs there any value in adding the site verification meta tag to each page instead of uploading a single html verification filep  pFor example, what happens if I accidentally delete the  verification file from my site some time after the site has already been verified .  Does it need to be need to be reverified. Or is  the verification process  a one time deal  In which case, it may be safer to include in each page even though it does not   help indexingp

Negative 4183 pI have a privatepublic secure cert. My Java counterparts have the public key.

Its so well known, that I cant find a solution. If they take my string and the private key, they can obviously sign it correctly, and verify it. If I take my string, I can sign and verify it within .Net fine.

Negative 4183 pExtremely often, in all kinds of various MVC34 apps I debug in VS2012 on my home machine, after pressing F5 to start debugging and open the configured start page in Chrome, it can take several  up to ten  minutes before becoming active. p  pI have no long startup procedures that load caches or generate code etc. and the same app will start instantly on my office machine.

Negative 4183 pI am working on internationalizing an old MFC project and I have many thousands of hardcoded strings to move into the string table.  Im looking for a macro, addin, or some information on creating a macro, addin, or wizard that would allow me to semiautomate the process.  I would like to be able to highlight a string, rightclick and select something like move to resource and have the string added to the string table for the project.  Something customizable would be great such that I could edit the identifier created and have the tool replace the hardcoded string in the code with a look up function that I provide the name of.  I searched for a few days and cant find anything like this.  Does anyone know of a tool already in existence, or can provide some info on what VS extensiblity classes I can use to write one  I am using VS2010.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4183 pI have a document management system that records all historical events in a history table. Ive been asked to be able to provide the oldest docid that has a status of 5 for a given client on a given date. The table looks something like this truncated for simplicityp  precodedochistory     id integer     docid integer     eventdate timestamp     clientid integer     statusid integer codepre  pThe clientid and statusid columns are the value of the document after the event has occurred. This means that the maximum history event row for a document defined by docid will match the same columns in the document table. Limiting events by a specific event date, you can see what the values of the document were at that time. Because these values are not static, I cant just simply search for a specific clientid with a statusid of 5 because the found result might not match the maxid of the document. Hopefully that makes some sense.p  pWhat Ive found to work, but is slow, is the followingp  precodeselect     t. from     select         distinct on docid,              from         dochistory     where         eventdate lt 20130217 235959     order by         docid, id desc t where     t.clientid  9999 and     t.statusid  5 limit 1 codepre  pBasically, Im getting the maximum ID for a particular document ID before the given maximum event date, and then verifying that that maximum history item is assigned to the given client, with the status set to 5.p  pThe drawback to doing it my way is that Im scanning all history records for all clients to get their maximums, and then finding what Im looking for for one client and status. As of right now, this scans roughly 15.06 million rows, and takes about 90 seconds on my dev server which is not blazing fast.p  pTo make matters more complicated I need to do this for each day of the previous week, or seven times total each run. Additionally, all documents in the system start with a status of 5, which represents new. This makes it so that this query would just return the first document entered for that clientp  precodeselect  from dochistory where clientid  9999 and     statusid  5 and     eventdate lt 20130217 235959     order by id limit 1 codepre  pWhat Im hoping to do is scan until I find a maximum history record for a specific document that matches the specific client and status values without having to first find the maximum ids for all document ids for all clients first. I dont know if this can be done with a windowing function partition by or some other logic that Im currently not seeing.p  pAn example of one of the events in the dochistory tablep  precode select id, docid, event, oldvalue, newvalue, eventdate, clientid, statusid from dochistory where docid  9999999 order by id     id     docid   event  oldvalue  newvalue          eventdate          clientid  statusid   25362415  9999999     13                        20130214 114950.032824       9999          5  25428192  9999999     15                        20130218 111548.272542       9999          5  25428193  9999999      7  5          1          20130218 111548.301377       9999          1 codepre  pEvent 7 is status changed, and the old and new values show that it was changed from 5 to 1, which is reflected in the statusid column. For an eventdate of less than or equal to 20130217 235959, the above record would have been the oldest NEW document with statusid of 5, but after 2172013 it would not have.p

Negative 4183 pI want to display a strong.docxstrong file in a codeViewcode in Android. The file has mathematical symbols and also images in between the text. I want to display many such files and flip through them via codeswipecode gesture. I have successfully done the same for strong.txtstrong files. And can now very easily go to the next page on swipe. The code for strong.txtstrong file is as followsp  precodepublic String readTxtString fileName                try              InputStream is             is  context.getAssets.openfileName  .txt             ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream  new ByteArrayOutputStream              int i             i  is.read             while i  1                              byteArrayOutputStream.writei                 i  is.read                           is.close              return byteArrayOutputStream.toString                     catch IOException e                       e.printStackTrace                   return fileName      codepre  pThis code returns the text which I then display in my codeTextViewcode. This way I only need to change the name of the file dynamically and on swipe the Text changes.p  pNow I want to modify this code so that I can display MS Word files.docx which contain text,images and mathematical symbols.p  pI have already checked many similar threads on this topic on stack overflow as well as on other forums  These are the links many people have suggested as answers to similar questions and I have already given these a try a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12816281howtoreaddocandexcelfileinandroidLink1a and a hrefhttpwww.chrisumbel.comarticleandroidtextviewrichtextspannablestringlink2a p  pAlso on many other threads people have recommended strongJopendocumentstrong. I have also read about that and learnt that Android does not support open document format. so that option seems unlikely. But if you have any workaround or a good detailed explanation with respect to adding the JOpenDocument library to the project and displaying rich text then please share that solution because I have searched for it a lot but couldnt find any. p  pThere is also another library called strongOliveDocLibrarystrong to display rich word files on android. here is the a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidofficedemodownloadslistlinka from where I downloaded the lib. The demo included in that download package works just fine.But the lib is a trial version. So am currently trying to work with this library and see where it goes. But am still in search of better options.p  pAny help regarding this is appreciated. Any pointers other than the ones mentioned above are most welcome.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI got a suggestion which told the use of strongApache POIstrongHWPF more specifically in the first bounty I started on this question. After exploring Apache POI for some time, I got few codes which were writing into a doc file, reading the doc file, updating the excel sheets etc.p  pSuch Sample codefor Java which I found off the internet goes something like thisp  precodeimport java.io. import org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument import org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.WordExtractor  public class ReadDocFile  public static void mainString[] args  File file  null WordExtractor extractor  null  try   file  new FilecNew.doc FileInputStream fisnew FileInputStreamfile.getAbsolutePath HWPFDocument documentnew HWPFDocumentfis extractor  new WordExtractordocument String [] fileData  extractor.getParagraphText forint i0iltfileData.lengthi iffileData[i]  null System.out.printlnfileData[i]   catchException exep   codepre  pSo I added this libraryApache POI to my Android project in eclipse and tried this sample code with some changes. And tried displaying it on a codeTextViewcode. The problem here though is it doesnt display the images like strongOliveDocLibrarystrong does. So if Someone is going to suggest Apache POI, then I request for a solid pointer or a code which reads a strongdocxstrong file and strongallstrong its contentsthat includes images and displays them in a custom view.p  pstrongApache POIstrong is a great thing but sadly I didnt find any good examplessamples implementing those libraries. If you know a good source of examplesw.r.t MS word only then please share them in comments. p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pIn strongOliveDocLibrarystrong package the code provided works fine. There is water mark of Olive on the View though. Currently am working on performing codeSwipecode on that code. But the problem remains that its a trial version.p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pI think strongOliveDocLibrarystrong is the most efficient way to do it. Though it has a disadvantage of being a trial version, I think no other library does a better job than this library to full fill my specific requirement. The detailed answer has been posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma160532092021499belowa. As the bounty time is about to get over. I would request the people who may have an alternate and better solution to post it as soon as possible. For now am going with strongOliveDocLibrarystrong and accepting my own answer.p

Negative 4183 pas I understood, the OpenCL uses a modified C language by adding some keywords like global as the general purpose for defining kernel function. And now I am doing a frontend inside F language, which has a code quotation feature that can do meta programming you can think it as some kind of reflection tech. So I would like to know if there is a general binary intermediate representation for the kernel instead of C source file.p  pI know that CUDA supports LLVM IR for the binary intermediate representation, so we can create kernel programmatically, and I want to do the same thing with OpenCL. But the document says that the binary format is not specified, each implementation can use their own binary format. So is there any general purpose IR which can be generated by program and can also run with NVIDIA, AMD, Intel implementation of OpenCLp  pThansk.p

Among all apps on the device, the limit is 4 of the disk size or 20GB, whichever is smaller. For hard drives that are less than 30GB, the limit among all apps on the device is 375MB.

Negative 4183 pThis is really bizarre and Ive already wasted almost an entire day trying to figure out this ridiculous little problem... ahhh, I need some help from any who are willing to dig into this p  pSo Ive got a UITextField, in which I need to limit the input characters to lowercase alpha, numeric and underscores only.  No spaces, but still allow backspacedelete.

However, it is random, but this is one way I have found that will eventually trigger it... if you type 3 letters fast, then hit space bar a few times fast... then 3 more letters fast, then space bar a few times, and continue this, the problems start. example  type abc spacespacespace xyz spacespacespace gbhspacespacespacep  pNow EVERY OTHER space bar touch will act as though you are touching one of the bottom keys just above it usually v, b or n.  So instead of showing the pressed darkening of the space bar to let you know you pressed the space bar it actually is darkening one of these other keys and entering v,b or n into the text field.  But it is only happening every other space bar tap, and it only happens after the above mentioned sequence or some other random combination of letters and space bar attempts.p  pThis is a really strange problem, and I think I have done my best to try to explain it here.  ANY help at all here would be greatly appreciated.  And if something wasnt explained clearly by me, I would be happy to make an attempt at clarifying.  Thanks p

Negative 4183 pI am wondering how I could preallocate and initialize the character sequence inside an ordinary C string. The occasion for the question is querying the Windows registry for values. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma163047071794538this answera for some example code. The trouble is that the system call writes into an array allocated by the caller. Ive already solved the immediate problem with an allocated buffer, but this solution has what seems to be an extraneous string copy. This got me curious about the general question, one more geared at library authors, about how one could eliminate the extra operation.p  pThe a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppstringbasicstringbasicstring relnofollowconstructors for codestdbasicstringcodea dont include an obvious way of doing this. In many ways Id like to have a string constructor with a codestduniqueptrcode argument that absorbs the allocation behind the pointer as its internal storage. Im thinking of something like this sample codep  precodesizet len  ... Determine len stdstringallocatortype a  stdstringallocatortype stduniqueptrlt chart[] gt p a.allocate len    ... Copy characters to p stdstring s p, len, a    constanttime constructor codepre  pThis doesnt work because theres no such constructor. The question is about how one might implement such a constructor.p  pIt seems that the right way is to define a custom allocator whose codeallocatecode function returns the preallocated storage and does so only once. Presumably this class would itself be generic, instantiated with the string allocator like in the example. This seems like it would work, but Im sure I dont understand all the ramifications of that approach.p

Negative 4183 pI have a problem with my code where I try to save a many to many connection between two objects, but for some reason it doesnt get saved.p  pWe used the code first method to create our database, in our database we have the following entities where this problem is aboutp  precodepublic class Product      public int Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public virtual ICollectionltProductTaggt ProductTags  get set   public class ProductTag      public int Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public virtual ICollectionltProductgt Products  get set   codepre  pThe table ProductTagProducts got automatically created, which is of course just a connection table between the two.p  pNow creating products works fine. We can just run the following and it will create the connnections in the ProductTagProducts tablep  precodeProduct.ProductTags.AddproductTag codepre  pTo make sure no duplicate tasks are in the database, we handle the saving for it ourselves. The productTag always contains a product tag with an existing ID.p  pThe problem occurs when we want to edit the same or another product. There are existing tags for the product. And we use the following process to save itp  precodeListltProductTaggt productTags  new ListltProductTaggt string[] splittedTags  productLanguagePost.TagList.Split, foreach string tag in splittedTags      ProductTag productTag  new ProductTag     productTag.Name  tag     productTags.AddproductTagRepository.InsertAndOrUseproductTag  codepre  pWe split the tags by comma, thats how it is received from the HTML element. Then we define a new entity for it and use InsertAndOrUse to determine if the tag already existed. If the tag already existed, it returns the same entity but with the ID filled in, if it did not exist yet it adds the tag to the database, and then also returns the entity with ID. We create a new list to be sure that the product doesnt have duplicate Ids in there I have tried it with adding it to the products existing tag list directly, same result.p  precodeproduct.ProductTags  productTags productRepository.InsertOrUpdateproduct productRepository.Save codepre  pThen we set the list to ProductTags and let the repository handle the insert or update, of course, an update will be done. Just in case, this is the InsertOrUpdate functionp  precodepublic void InsertOrUpdateProduct product      if product.Id  defaultint          context.Products.Addproduct      else          context.Entryproduct.State  EntityState.Modified       codepre  pThe save method just calls the contexts SaveChanges method. When I edit the product, and add another tag it doesnt save the new tag. However, when I set a breakpoint on the save function I can see that they are both there img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8H8Al.png altenter image description herep  pAnd when I open the newly added tag Oehlala I can even refer back to the product through it img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjy7e8.png altenter image description herep  pBut when the save happens, which succeeds with all other values, there are no connections made in the ProductTagProducts table. Maybe it is something really simple, but I am clueless at the moment. I really hope that someone else can give a bright look.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit As requested the ProductTags InsertAndOrUse method.

Has anyone found another workaround for this Are there any better aproaches, any disadvantages with my designp  pThanks in advance. The code should compile just fine, and show how Id like my interface to be designed and why Ive made use of those tricks. Best regards, Kalrishp

Negative 4183 pOdd problem. I have a potential solution, but Im soliciting improvements. All of this is related to a MS SQLC project, so think of things in that context if required.p  pMaking a form for users to enter a bank account number. But different client banks we work with have different and weird requirements. This one has numbers that are 13 digits long, but the 2,3 digit are unknown and need to be entered by the user. The trailing 10 digits are zero padded, and 2 or 3 characters on the end should be shown to the user. Basically, nutty. Client specific. A few other clients have various requirements for validation and stuff  Im trying to knock out with this, so something expandable enough to handle random client requests is what Im looking for.p  pSo, as an example, somebody might have the partial account number code10000123456code. Where they need to enter the missing two digits. But we can show 456. So, want to get that into a masked textbox that displays code1000456code, only allowing them to edit the codescode.p  pOf course, all this configuration information is stored in a database. Not all people may even be missing numbers digits.p  pBest solution Ive come up with so far is to store the partial number with some magic character to designate missing, probably codecode. Then store a Regex along side of it, which validates and groups regions. But also marks regions with some special crap, like hidden. Which I figure I can encode in the group name, which is dumb, but the best idea I have.p  pSo, in the database, I might have a record likep  precodeNumber            Validation 10000123456     1dd0lthAccount Idgt123456 codepre  pSo, we have a number partial, and a validation expression. But that validation expression has some magic stuff in a named capture group. The h signifies that that range should be hidden. So, I can hide random ranges, or whatever the next crazy client wants.p  pThe above would appear as a masked textbox containing code10000456code, where the user was only allowed to enter the second and third digit. Text out to the side could describe what the user was required to enter as Account Id, the remainder of the named capture group name.p  pEh. Its an idea. It feels like an abuse of everything we all hold dear, though.p  p[EDIT]p  pSo, this doesnt really solve the problem well, as I cannot of course match the value before its valid and thus cannot know the ranges to hide or show until after the user enters a valid sequence.  If it was possible to delve into a regexs AST or something... thatd be neato.p

Negative 4183 pThis is a question that has to do more about performance and implementation. I want to create an app for getting info about tv series and would like to use thetvdb.com api. thetvdb offers an xml api and some guides to get u started. For initialization they say you must download a zip file according to the id of the series you want to add. p  pThe xml consists of three xml files. One is about the actors, one is about the banners and one that has all the info about the tv show inclucing seasons and episodes and overviews etc. The guide says that you parse the xml and add them to the tables of your db as you like. p  pstrongMy question is the followingstrong Is it better to download the xml parse it and store it in my db and delete the xmls Or should I use the xmls and parse them every time i want to get the shows info and present them to the user What is the cost of one implementation and what is the cost of the second one p  pNo code yet since I am still designing it.p
Negative 4183 pI took a bit of a long break from playing with Haskell, and Im starting to get back in to it.    Im definitely still learning my way around the language.  Ive realized that one of the things that has always made me nervousuncomfortable when writing Haskell is that I dont have a strong grasp on how to craft algorithms that are both idiomatic strongandstrong performant.  I realize that premature optimization is the root of all evil, but similarly slow code will have to be dealt with eventually and the I just cant get rid of my preconceived notions about languages that are so highlevel being super slow.p  pSo, in that vein, I started playing with test cases.  One of them that I was working on was a nave, straightforward implementation of the classical 4th Order RungeKutta method, applied to the fairly trivial IVP codedydt  y y0  1code, which gives codey  etcode.  I wrote a completely straight forward implementation in both Haskell and C which Ill post in a moment.  The Haskell version was incredibly succinct and gave me warm fuzzies on the inside when I looked at it, but the C version which actually wasnt horrible to parse emat allem was over twice as fast.p  pI realize that it isnt 100 fair to compare the performance of 2 different languages and that until the day we all die C will most likely always hold the crown as the king of performance, especially handoptimized C code.  Im not trying to get my Haskell implementation to run just as fast as my C implementation.  But Im pretty certain that if I was more cognizant of what I was doing then I could eek a bit more speed out of this particular Haskell implementation.p  pThe Haskell version was compiled with code02code under GHC 7.6.3 on OS X 10.8.4, the C version was compiled with Clang and I gave it no flags.  The Haskell version averaged around 0.016 seconds when tracked with codetimecode, and the C version around 0.006 seconds.p  pThese timings take in to account the entire running time of the binary, including output to stdout, which obviously accounts for some of the overhead, but I did do emsomeem profiling on the GHC binary by recompiling with codeprof autoallcode and running with codeRTS pcode and also looking at the GC stats with codeRTS scode.  I didnt really understand all that much of what I saw, but it seemed to be that my GC wasnt out of control though could probably get reined in a little bit 5, Productivity at 93 User, 85 total elapsed and that most of the productive time was spent in the function codeiterateRKcode, which I knew would be slow when I wrote it but it wasnt immediately obvious to me how to go about cleaning it up.  I realize that Im probably incurring a penalty in my usage of a List, both in the constant codeconscodeing and the laziness in dumping the results to stdout.p  pWhat exactly am I doing wrong  What library functions or Monadic wizardry am I tragically unaware of that I could be using to clean up codeiterateRKcode What are some good resources for learning how to be a GHC profiling rockstarp  h1RK.hsh1  precoderk4  Double gt Double gt Double gt Double gt Double gt Double gt Double rk4 y h t y  y  h6  k1  2k2  2k3  k4   where k1  y t y         k2  y t  h2 y  h2  k1         k3  y t  h2 y  h2  k2         k4  y t  h y  h  k3  iterateRK y h t0 y0  y0iterateRK y h t1 y1   where t1  t0  h         y1  rk4 y h t0 y0  main  do   let y t y  y   let h  1e3   let y0  1.0   let t0  0   let results  iterateRK y h t0 y0   putStrLn . show take 1000 results codepre  h1RK.ch1  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt  define ITERATIONS 1000  double rk4double fdouble t, double x, double h, double tn, double yn    double k1, k2, k3, k4    k1  ftn, yn   k2  ftn  h2, yn  h2  k1   k3  ftn  h2, yn  h2  k2   k4  ftn  h, yn  h  k3    return yn  h6  k1  2k2  2k3  k4   double expDotdouble t, double x    return x   int main    double t0, y0, tn, yn, h, results[ITERATIONS]   int i    h  1e3   y0  1.0   t0  0.0   yn  y0    fori  0 i lt ITERATIONS i        results[i]  yn      yn  rk4expDot, h, tn, yn     tn  h       fori  0 i lt ITERATIONS i        printf.10lf, results[i]     ifi  ITERATIONS  1       printf,      else       printfn       return 0  codepre
Negative 4183 pProblemp  blockquote   pFor this part of the assignment, you will write a function to evaluate   the mathematical exponential function, ex.

Negative 4183 pOne way to improve engineering designs is by formulating the equations describing the design in the form of a minimization or maximization problem. This approach is called design optimization. Examples of quantities to be minimized are energy consumption and construction materials. Items to be maximized are useful life and capacity such as the vehicle weight that can be supported by a bridge. In this project, we consider the problem of minimizing the material cost associated with building a water tank. The water tank consists of a cylindrical part of radius r and height h, and a hemispherical top. The tank is to be constructed to hold 500 meter cubed when lled. The surface area of the cylindrical part is 2pirh, and its volume is pir2. The surface area of the hemispherical top is given by 2pir2, and is volume is given by 2pir33. The cost to construct the cylindrical part of the tank is 300 per square meter of surface areathe hemispherical part costs 400 per square meter. Use the fminbnd function to compute the radius that results in the least cost. Compute the corresponding height h.p  pI got the right answer but it is very chaotic. I created bunch of function.

Negative 4183 pI have an iPhone app, built in Xamarin, that stores objects to a local SQLite database. As it takes a long time to load all of the data, I am loading it 20 records at a time, and loading more as the user scrolls. p  pI am paging by CreatedDate, and this is stored as an Integer field by its DateTime.Ticks property the number of 100 nanoseconds since DateTime.MinValue. I always pass the oldest loaded CreatedDate to the read function. p  ul liInteger column 8 bytes signedli liDateTime.Ticks 8 bytes signedli ul  pThe code to write the CreatedDate is as follows p  precodevar param  cmd.CreateParameter param.ParameterName  date param.Value  myObject.DateCreated.Value.Ticks cmd.Parameters.Addparam codepre  pAnd the code to read the next page is as follows p  precodecmd.CommandText  SELECT  FROM MyTable WHERE CreatedDate lt                     offset.HasValue  offset.Value.Ticks  DateTime.MaxValue.Ticks                      ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT   pageSize codepre  pI can tell that the dates are correct, because my sections in my UITableView are based on their CreatedDates. p  pstrongSo heres all the weird behavior i.e. my question.strongp  pstrongI started off in the simulator.strong At first, I was using DESC and it was returning the oldest objects. Then I switched it to ASC and it was returning the newest objects. This seems backwards. Then, it magically started working correctly with DESC. Paging began working in the simulator, and still works. p  pstrongThen I switched to a real iPhone.strong The DESC and ASC issue showed up again, but this time has not fixed itself ASC returns the most recent objects. Either way, when I scroll to the bottom of the UITableView, the load gets called again with the correct offset, but it gets no data back and therefore all paging stops. p  pstrongThings I know.strongp  ul liAll of the data is in the table, because if I codeSELECT code I get everything with the correct dates back.

Negative 4183 pI apologize that this is surely basic mavenwar plugin stuff, but Im totally not a maven user. I just have to hack this one thing into a project that is maven based.p  pWhat I need to do is to copy an essentially arbitrary directory and files into the root of my war. I need them to appear as resources available via HTTP when the war deploys.p  pI cannot simply put them in the right place in the source tree. This is because the files in question are actually the source files of my project. I realize this is a bit odd, but this is a documentation project, and I need to show the source and the effect all in the same war.p  pSo, in the general case, how would I configure the maven war plugin to copy a given directory, along with its contents, to the root of my war BTW, I have tried to make sense of the documentation of this tool, but it seems to be predicated on so much understanding of maven that it feels like Ill never understand it without learning maven first, and Im a bit too pressed for time to do that just nowp  pMany TIA Toby.p

Negative 4183 pI am pretty new to coding .NET web services. I find myself writing a .NET WCF application with about 20 web services. I would like to log the following eventsp  ol liRequest With Payload  who and whatli liResponse Did the query work, was data returnedli liErrors Was there some sort of errorli ol  pI wrote a simple function that does a SQL insert at each point. Every web service request gets at least two inserts  one at the request and another at the response. Each of the 10 methods needs at least 4 of these logging calls. Too much maintenance in my book.p  pI think this approach too hard and cumbersome  I will need to do a great deal of work to maintain it. I have used LOG4J I didnt configure with Axis2 in the past, it was able to log all of the above in the web server. The exceptions needed to be thrown, but the requestresponse logging was handled automagically. I dont know .NET well enough to feel like I have a good handle on my options.p  pAt this point I am considering Log4net or the Enterprise Library Semantic Logging Application Block. Do I have better choices Any suggestions as to which course might be easiest for a relative newbiep  pThanks, Mattp

Negative 4183 pWe currently have devices out in the field running UltraVNC as a VNC server. Because we have devices out in the field with nonroutable IP addresses we opted to go with an UltraVNC repeater server.p  pVNC is started on the device and we have a java applet running on the website that connects to the relay server. This works for us and we can have more than one session running at any given time via the repeater serverbut not on the same device. We want to replace the applet with a HTML5 solution because not everybody wants to use the Java applet. p  pWill Guacamole work for us Currently if a user that has permission goes to the site, they will see a link and if they click on it a popup is triggered with the applet inside it. If the service is started on the device a remote support session is started. p  pWill Guacamole work with the relay server Some of the devices run on Windows CE6 and some on the Windows 7 CE I cannot remember what they called this Windows 7 build, it is the CE version  p  pIs there a better solution available with no cost I have access to an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server to load the solution.p

Negative 4183 pId like to program a detection of a rectangular sheet of paper which doesnt absolutely need to be perfectly straight on each side as I may take a picture of it in the air which means the single sides of the paper might get distorted a bit.p  pThe app iOs and android CamScanner does this very very good and Im wondering how this might be implemented.

Negative 4183 pThis is probably a newbie question but I searched and couldnt find a satisfying answer. p  pMy node.js application seems to consume a lot of memory. Each process consumes about 100MB. I heard that nodejs itself has a 30MB memory footprint per process.p  pThe application is a JSON api, backed by MongoDB. In may cases, one API request will result in many database requests, mainly to populate the child relationships. A typical query is like this 1 get an array of objectIds based on query condition, and 2 iterate each objectId, and issue a query to the database to populate the data some call that hydration.p  pThe code is heavily using async.js. I tried to profile the memory usage and it seems async.js is using a lot of memory but there is no sign of memory leak. The author of async.js also came out with a stream library highland.js a hrefhttphighlandjs.orghttphighlandjs.orga. I am new to nodejs stream, and I am curious if this is a possible tool to replace async.js The web site seems to mention codeunderscorecode but I mainly use codeasync.jscode for the asynchronous processing.p  pThanksp

Negative 4183 pI am trying to update content of my page for printing. I want to have labels spans for each input element textboxes, lists, etc. to prevent textcutoff when printing. I want to make sure before printing that all these labels reflect the most uptodate user entered values from their respective input fields.p  pMy first idea was to just put a label after each textbox, and bind it with the same value on page render, and then hideshow the input or the label based on CSS media attribute. But then I also need to have codeonchangecode handlers for every input element to update its respective label every time its value is changed.p  pMy next thought was to use codeonbeforeprintcode and some jQuery to update the labels on the fly with the current values all in one spot. Cleaner, centralized, more concise code. p  pBut as far as I can tell, codeonbeforeprintcode and codeonafterprintcode are only supported in IE and Firefox. ... BUT ... every article or post I can find that talks about browser support for these two functions is from a good 4 or 5 years, or even more ago p  pSo Im wondering, have Chrome and Safari added support for these two functions at any point in the past 5 yearsp

Negative 4183 pI want to use an Arduino either Mega ADK or Due to control an external 16bit DAC chip. I have the evaluation board for the DAC chip. It says that the chip can be programmed using its Serial Peripheral Interface and it seems like from what I have read online, that this is possible to do with the Arduino.p  pBut I do not know where to start. I have been searching for anything that may be helpful for about a week now, but I have come up short. I havent been able to find any tutorial or help guide to figure out how to program the Arduino to communicate with the chip.p  pIf anyone could provide any material that would be helpful in learning SPI, I would greatly appreciate it.p  pThe manual for the DAC chip I am using is here a hrefhttpcds.linear.comdocsendatasheet2754f.pdf relnofollowhttpcds.linear.comdocsendatasheet2754f.pdfa I believe the important page on programming the chip is page 15.p  pThe manual for the evaluation board I am using is here a hrefhttpcds.linear.comdocsendemoboardmanualdc1546af.pdf relnofollowhttpcds.linear.comdocsendemoboardmanualdc1546af.pdfap  pOnce againg, any help would be extremely helpful as I have never done any programming between devices using SPI.

Negative 4183 pI currently have a for loop that iterates over each row checking for multiple conditions being true between rows the next and current row and within the same row.  I am getting an Error contextstack overflow. I have a bunch of nested ifelse statements too many and was wondering how people reduce the number of ifelse statements they use when there are a lot of possible combinations of conditions to check. Do you break this up into multiple loops  I see a few ways where I can segment the date into groupings and have ifelse statements within the groupings so would this be an if statement with ifelse statements nested but I am not sure if that will help me get rid of the error I am getting.p  precodefor i in 1  lengthdfid1 ifelsemany conditions, do this, ifelsemany conditions, do this,    ifelsemany conditions, do this, ...... ifelsemany conditions, do this, xxxxx  codepre  pSo I am essentially iterating over each row because I need to compare within each row and against the previous row. The main problem is I seem to reach the maximum number of ifelse statements allowed to be nested. Is there a way to better group this to reduce that limiting factor because right now mine are all nested. Can I have 5 if statements one of my many criteria is actually a 5 level cateogry and then nest ifelse statements within those with other criteria so the loop does not evaluate every ifelse statement Is that viable in Rp

Negative 4183 pIm currently developing an Application that uses a Database  ContentProvider to provide certain location data thats pulled from the network and stored locally in a database periodically.p  pIve verified that the database is created correctly in the Application, and the Tables are populated with data by exporting a copy of the app local database to the SD card for viewing in a SQL browser  so the data not being present is not the issue here.p  pThe odd behavior is probably better visualized through a couple of screen shots of my debugging processp  pSo, initially when I did my queries, all of my codeCursorcode objects were returning 1 for the row count, even though I verified that a codeSELECT  FROM TABLENAMEcode statement should return values, since the database I pulled off of the device contains row data. Heres a look at the debugger stepp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt0PL1.jpg altenter image description herep  pNotice that when the cursor is initially returned, mCount displays as 1.p  pOut of curiosity, I added the cursor.moveToFirst call, and heres a screenshot from after that stepp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh2AEm.jpg altenter image description herep  pNotice that the cursor count changed from 1 to 3, which corresponds to the correct number of rows since the application only accounts for 3 continents atm.  Unfortunately, this added line that should be unnecessary still doesnt fix my problem, since CursorAdapter.bindView and CursorAdapter.newView still fail to be called with the resulting cursor.p  pIm confused as to what could be causing this issue, and how to fix it  If anyone could give any insight into what the problem could be, please let me know.  Also, if any additional code is needed, such as the SQL create statements, etc let me know  however, as Ive already mentioned the database is created fine and queries performed on the exported db copy outside of the Android application work just fine...p  pOne last thing, the application is built for API levels 14.p

Negative 4183 pIm trying to convert from a Silverlightbased media player to an HTML5Javascript implementation on an ASP.NET website using MVC on a homebased webserver using IIS Express on Windows 8.1.p  pThe player needs to support playing segments within the media file, meaning I need the ability to seek in the file by setting currentTime on the audio or video element and using a timeout to stop the playback since using an ontimeupdate handle proved too flaky to stop at the right time.  The problem is supporting the multiple file formats required by the different browsers.  Rather than preconverting everything, I opted to implement a ConvertCheckpathmediafile.oggamptypeaudioogg action that returns a file buffer, doing a lazy conversion if the file doesnt exist yet in the given format, but does in another supported format.  This works okay with IE and FireFox, but on Chromium, seeking using the currentTime property doesnt work.  It does work on IE and FireFox though.p  pEffectively I set up an audio or video element like thisp  precodeltaudiogt   ltsource srcConvertCheckpathmediafile.mp3amptypeaudiomp3 typeaudiompeggt   ltsource srcConvertCheckpathmediafile.oggamptypeaudioogg typeaudioogggt   Your browser does not support the media formats avaliable. ltaudiogt codepre  pIs there an API in MVC and ASP.NET that would let my action set up the proper streaming of the media file that would work with Chromium, and is easy enough for a novice like me to use  Or is there a simpler way to do the interception and lazy conversion  Otherwise I might just have to have the server convert the media files whenever the initial page references just one of them, rather than trigger the conversion when the actual format is needed.p  pIm wishing Microsoft would just support Silverlight everywhere, as my Silverlightbased player both works and looks a lot better.p  pThanks.p  pJohnp

Negative 4183 pI am struggling to find information on a lot of small issues Im starting to come across since recently integrating the ObjectListView into my application.  I must admit, I love the control and it takes a lot of work away from me by having the control pretty much do everything that I need.p  pHowever, amongst a few issues that Ive come across thus far, one is the fact that if I turn off grouping for individual columns it no longer allows me to sort these columns.p  pFor example, my ListView control has an ID, Summary, Location, etc., etc.  I currently run grouping on the ID because I attach a unique footer against every ID and it looks good.  But, when I click on Summary, or Location it then groups all items by Summary or Location and therefore I end up with the group header but no footer anymore because the footer no longer corresponds with the ID.p  pWhat I want to achieve is to allow the user to click on any other column, but still maintain the group by ID and thus keep the footer against each item.  I only want the items to sort, not group, but as mentioned, when I turn off the grouping against each column, it turns off the sort function.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pBasically, looking at the screenshot below, I want to be able to click on the Priority Column Header for example to sort the list of object by Priority, but still maintain the Group By Ticket with the Group Footer details.  And basically be able to click on any Column header to sort the list but keeping the grouping by Ticket.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqHERw.jpg altenter image description herep  pI have intercepted the OLVBeforeCreatingGroups event to addp  precodee.Parameters.GroupByColumn  TicketID codepre  pThis now seems to maintain my grouping by Ticket no matter what Column header I click on, but I now loose the sort functionality.p

Negative 4183 pI have a little I hope issue trying to use Doubleselect element from Struts2 jQuery plugin  and after searching the internet I found nothing about it so I come here to get your help.br I have a jsp with two struts2 jQuery Plugin selects to get the second select emModeloem loaded based of the item selected from the first one emFabricanteem.  When the jsp is loaded, the first select is loaded but when I select an item from this first select, the value of this selected item does not arrive is value is null to the action so there is no way to query the values for the second select from database consequently, second select is never loaded.brp  pI have followed the a hrefhttpstruts.jgeppert.comstruts2jqueryshowcaseindex.action

Negative 4183 pSo Im having an issue working with Sikuli.  Theres a situation where multiple occurrences of an image exist.  To grab all of them, you can simply do a findAll, but it saves each image as some sort of object, rather than the image.  I know that you can get the images by using getLastMatches, but I want to sort it first.  So heres the code that I got that grabs all the images and sorts them.  I found some of the information on the Sikuli documentationp  precodedef byymatch   return match.y  icons  findAllimage sortedicons  sortedicons, keybyy codepre  pThe problem with this, though, is that sortedicons contains a bunch of iterable objects at least thats what I saw them called, and not the images.  Is there a way to revert back to an image while keeping the new list sorted  Using getLastMatches gives a list of the original unsorted list.p  pAlso, its Sikuli 1.0.1.p  pThanks.p  pThis should illustrate the problem hopefully.  In order to sort the images by their y value, I have to use the findAll operation if there is a way of doing this without using find then please share.  However, this converts the image from a string, i.e.p  precodeimagename.png codepre  pinto... well whatever this is matchp  precodeM[8,1045 37x28]SS0[0,0 1920x1080] S1.00 Center26,1059 codepre  pthe self.assets.getimageimage function requires a string, though so the imagename.png rather than the funky thing you get out of using find.p  precodedef exampleMethodimage, dx0, dy0     clickPatternself.assets.getimageimage.targetOffsetdx, dy  def byymatch   return match.y  image  imagename.png icons  findAllimage sortedicons  sortedimage, keybyy  exampleMethodsortedicons[0] codepre  pTherefore, I need 1 of 2 thingsp  ol liA way to convert the find object back to a String AFTER sortingli liA way to sort the images by their y values while keeping the images as stringsli ol  pHopefully this helps.p

Negative 4183 pI want to upgrade my XCode 6 GM to XCode 6.0.1 However, I have a new version of my iOS app waiting for review by Apple. If I upgrade my XCode before Apple approves the app, would that mess up my certificate Any suggestion much appreciated.p
Negative 4183 pEdited I reported this bug to Apple and now its closed, tested on beta iOS 9.0 13A4254v and works correctly.p  pEdited for better explanationp  pI have a bunch of articles in a web page, all wrapped into a div column. These articles have a class with absolute position, and fixed width and height.p  pthere is a button to apply  a translate3d to the wrappercolumn  a window.history.pushStatep  pAll the styles are applied correctly to all the articles, but when i push the button and after the pushState, allsome of the nthchild styles are not applied correctly left, top and width. If i change the nthchild to nthoftype all works correctly after the pushState.p  pThe problem seems to be visible when safari determines to activate the possibility to switch into reader mode, after pushing the click button and affects to the translate3d elements hardware accelerated.p  pIt happends on Safari iOS8 using iPad2, iPad3 retina and 4. it dont happends using an iPad mini retina. Using iOS7 and before all works correctly, but no works using iOS8.p  pCodep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale  1.0, maximumscale  1.0, minimumscale  1.0, userscalable  1.0gt     ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappstatusbarstyle contentblackgt     ltstylegt         body              position relative             width 100             height 100             padding 0             margin 0             overflow hidden                  column              webkittransition 0.35s transition 0.35s             webkittransform translate3d0px, 0px, 0px              position absolute             top 10px             left 10px              border 1px solid Grey             width 300px             height 225px                  .moveColumn              webkittransform translate3d200px, 0px, 0px important               article          position absolute         overflow hidden          articlenthchild1          left 0         top 0         width 300px         height 300px         backgroundcolor Red          articlenthchild2          left 0px         top 305px         width 605px         height 300px         backgroundcolor Blue          articlenthchild3          left 305px         top 0         width 300px         height 300px         backgroundcolor Green          .button          position absolute         left 10px         top 250px         backgroundcolor Grey           ltstylegt     ltscript languagejavascriptgt         var veces  0         function moveColumn              var column  document.querySelectorcolumn              column.classList.togglemoveColumn              var obj               obj.sectionId  section             window.history.pushStateobj, TITLE, vp  veces             veces              ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idcolumngt         ltarticlegtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Negative 4183 pI am downloading an xml file and saving it to the phone strongWindows Phone 8 appstrong, then I open it as a list. This list has greek words in it with upper, lower and special characters. I want the user to be able to search thru this list without making him write the same text as is in the list, so, so far I made the search bar and the list to turn into Upper characters so if the user types to the list highlights to,To,TO erasing temporarily the words not matching bringing up the ones matching. But if the user tries to write a letter without intonation the words in the list that have intonation will all be erased until the user presses backspace and type the letter with intonation. p  pexample list got 2 words.  , . User presses letter , in the list,  disappears and  becomes strongstrong. Now the user types  and strongMstrong disappears as well because he had to type . If he had it would be strongstrong and so on.p  pSo my question is, is it possible to replace a character with intonation to the same character without intonation For example.  to a,  to A, etc. On the Unicode character table they have different codes.p  pThe code so farp  precode  private void businessFilterStringTextChangedobject sender, TextChangedEventArgs e              sI.ItemsSource  businesses.Collection.Whereb gt b.name.ToUpper.ContainssearchBox.Text.ToUpper  b.address.ToUpper.ContainssearchBox.Text.ToUpper.ToList         LayoutUpdateFlag  true           private void sILayoutUpdatedobject sender, EventArgs e              if LayoutUpdateFlag                     SearchVisualTreesI                  LayoutUpdateFlag  false          private void SearchVisualTreeDependencyObject targetElement               var count  VisualTreeHelper.GetChildrenCounttargetElement          for int i  0 i lt count i                      var child  VisualTreeHelper.GetChildtargetElement, i             if child is TextBlock                              textBlock1  TextBlockchild                 prevText  textBlock1.Text.ToUpper                 HighlightText                          else                              SearchVisualTreechild                               private void HighlightText          if textBlock1  null                  string text  textBlock1.Text.ToUpper           textBlock1.Text  text           textBlock1.Inlines.Clear            int index  text.IndexOfsearchBox.Text.ToUpper           int lenth  searchBox.Text.Length             if index lt 0                          Run run  new Run  Text  text.Substringindex, lenth, FontWeight  FontWeights.ExtraBold               run.Foreground  new SolidColorBrushColors.Orange               textBlock1.Inlines.Addnew Run  Text  text.Substring0, index, FontWeight  FontWeights.Normal               textBlock1.Inlines.Addrun               textBlock1.Inlines.Addnew Run  Text  text.Substringindex  lenth, FontWeight  FontWeights.Normal                       else                          textBlock1.Text  No Match                      codepre

Negative 4183 pCan anyone enlighten me as to how one would be able to trigger a non standard realtime notification on a Windows 8 machine My objective here was simply to find a slick method through which the end user is presented with an enhanced notification slide displayed via a slide in5 second fade out dialog box.p  pBest example I can think of to illustrate what I am trying to achieve would be thinking of it like when the charms bar is presented which can automatically fade away.

This notifications needs to be triggered automatically upon the system receiving a push notification.p  pI have loomed into various notification methods such as default windows notifications, offline Google Apps notifications,... problem however is that they all seem not to allow me to customize the notification window to meet my needs.p  pAny suggestions  examples would be very helpful.p  pBTW  as an alternative solution  is there simply a way that I might be able to have Windows automatically load and snap into view the contents of a specific Windows app containing my content to the left or right side of the screen upon receiving a push notification vs displaying the standard toast bubblep

So, a bank0 interrupt shows up on 17, 20, and                       a bank1 interrupt shows up on 18, 19, 20                                           interrupts  lt2 17gt, lt2 18gt, lt2 19gt, lt2 20gt                     gpiocontroller                     gpiocells  lt2gt                     interruptcontroller                     interruptcells  lt2gt              codepre blockquote  pFrom the references on the internet The reg  0x7e200000 is understood but What is 0xb4.p  ol start2 liI read the device tree file in archarmbootdtsbcm2835rpib.dtsli ol  pand for gpio following section was presentp  precode      compatible  raspberrypi,modelb, brcm,bcm2835     model  Raspberry Pi Model B      memory              reg  lt0 0x10000000gt           leds              compatible  gpioleds              act                      label  ACT                     gpios  ltampgpio 16 1gt                     defaultstate  keep                     linux,defaulttrigger  heartbeat                     ampgpio      pinctrlnames  default     pinctrl0  ltampalt0 ampalt3gt      alt0 alt0              brcm,pins  lt0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 14 15 40 45gt             brcm,function  lt4gt  alt0            alt3 alt3              brcm,pins  lt48 49 50 51 52 53gt             brcm,function  lt7gt  alt3        codepre  pSo, Which one of the dts files should I use, and how to read and interpret those key value pairs, for eg what is pinctrl. and how does this approach affect on my code.p  pI know I am asking a lot of stuff here, but this is new and looks interesting and I want to modify my driver using this approach.

Negative 4183 pI have a trading card game Like top trumps Where theres a deck of cards on the left and one on the right, I want to pass objects between these lists of cards, which I CAN do. But not without using a switch case to select the new cards as in the code below, I need to pass the card objects and remove them so eventually one list will have all 30 cards and one will have none, how do I do this when all my cards on the left are simply called nextCard Can I use some sort of array Please use some sort os code or pseudocode in your answers, as Im just a beginner.   p  pTLDR Need to move card objects between lists, Adding them to one list, deleting from another.

Negative 4183 pI am running on a standard Digital Ocean Ubuntu 14.04 droplet.p  pI installed my rails app with rails 4.2.0.beta4 and did my first bundle install with mri ruby 2.1.4 installed via RVM and using a gemset I called r420. After making some minor edits to the rails app I then installed jruby 1.7.16.1 and set up a gemset called j420 and then attempted to run a bundle install. Each time I attempt to run a bundle install with jruby the bundler hangs, producing no error. I tried defining the ruby dependency as advised by heroku in the Gemfile by adding the line ruby 1.9.3, engine  jruby, engineversion  1.7.16.1. This also hangs.p  pI saw in another entry on this site that someone suggested in an earlier version of rails that one might change the source to rubygems. This only resulted in an error message saying that no such domain exists.p  pOtherwise my app works fine in MRI, but I really want to get jRuby working if possible. I am interested in producing a thread safe rails app of course.p

Negative 4183 pI have the following issue with my JAXWS Ri webservicep  pLets say an external user wants to connect to the webservice with an url. During the request which passes through a loadbalancer and has SSLoffloading, the service is accessed on a OC4J container, which generates a WSDL that returns to the client. However, the returning WSDL contains URLs that contain the name of the internal machine instead of the external url. This results in a scenario where other programs cannot link to our WSDL, as they cannot fully download it see drawing for clarification.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combRcGf.jpg altenter image description herep  pHow can I make the WSDL accessible for external users i.e. trick the service into generating urls using the externalurl.com reference, rather than its machine namep  pFor what its worth In Tomcat you can specify proxyName and proxyPort for a Connector.

Negative 4183 pI wish to make a bluray videoalbum with all the family videorecordings Ive done with various recording devices throughup the years. Most of the recordings are 720p 30fps, recorded with my cellphone.p  pAs many others before me I have now learned, that simply saving my videoproject as a 720p 24fps rendering, results in a lot of jerkiness due to the missing frames. Not good.p  pBut what to do thenp  pAccording to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBlurayDiscMediaformat relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBlurayDiscMediaformata my other framerate options for 720p are 60fps 59.94fps or 50fps. So as Im writing this Im trying to render my project into a 59.94fps video. Logically, if my recordings have 30fps, therell be a little jerkiness here too thoughp  pAnother option I seem to have, is to save my project as a 1080i 29.97fps video. This is as close to the 30fps I can get, but again 29.97fps isnt 30fps, so what happens with jerkiness herep  pAlso, saving my 720p 30fps recordings as either 720p 59.94fps or 1080i 29.97fps logically results in a bigger filesize. Filesize is somewhat important too, as I expect this bluray collection to contain as many videos as possible. 720p recordings should give at least 11 hours on a standard 25gb bluray disc.p  pAnd finally, theres also the theoretical option of converting my 30fps recordings to smooth 24fps recordings, but as far as I can understand in my searches, this is extremely tricky  almost impossible to dop  pSurely it cant be this tricky to put everyday recordings onto a bluray disc I must be missing somethingp  pThe overall question is strongWhat is the best solution for putting 720p 30fps and 1080p 30fps videorecordings onto a bluray discstrongp  pThanksp  pEDITp  pTwo possible answers Im expecting to hearp  p1 Best practice to put 720p 30fps and 1080p 30fps videos onto a bluray, is to just stick to 720p 30fps and 1080p 30fps. Although it is not a bluray standard, the majority of players will play them anyway.p  p2 Best practice is to use 720p 59.94fps. Thats the only way to make sure the video plays on most devices. There are simply too many devices that will only play the bluray standards. So you can forget about using anything else.p

Negative 4183 pSorry if this is a duplicate of previous question, but I couldnt find quite what Im looking for.  Im in the process of converting a large cvs codeset 20 repositories with 15 years of history  1015 GB size to git.  Much of the size is due to binaries that were committed along with the code in the past. While some of the binaries are files that can be removed completely, its desirable to keep many of them as well as their history.  However, we dont want the repo to bloat.p  pWe are currently planning on using a hrefhttpsgithub.comjedbrowngitfat relnofollowgitfata to store the binaries, but Im in the process of writing a script to automatically convert the files.  My first step is to just try to identify all the files in the repo included deleted files which are binaries.  Are there any simple approaches to accomplishing this  Thanks for your helpp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI actually think I found a reasonable approach where I just run p  precodegit log numstat ltfirst commit hashgt HEAD codepre  pThis prints out a list of all the files with two columns in front, the first contains the number of changes to the file Im not sure if its in bytes or lines.  But the important parts is for binary files it is .  By selecting lines with this tag, and uniqueing them, I believe I get the complete list of binary files.  p  pAre there any flaws with this strategy p

Negative 4183 pIm quite new to Meteor and Im trying to figure out how to implement some use cases. One of them is an application for polls. Lets say you have a couple of users that can vote on a couple of polls for simplicity lets assume polls are limited to yesno questions.  Each use can only vote once.p  pIn SQL I would normalize this in 3 tablesp  precodeUSER idname VOTES useridpollidchoice POLLS idquestion codepre  pHowever in the documentstore world of mongodb, it seems encouraged to store the votes in a collection with the polls, like sop  precode[        id 1234     question the question     votes     [                userid 1         choice 1            ]    ] codepre  pIf a user votes on a poll an item gets inserted in the votes array of a poll. The server side has to validate the user has not already voted. To get the total score I have to iterate over the votes, but of course that could be improved by creating a field on each poll that contains the aggregated score, which gets updated as votes are added.p  pHowever, how does this propagate to other users Lets say a vote is added to a poll. Does the entire poll object get send over to other connected clients Because if a lot of people or voting, the votes array can get big and will cause a lot of traffic... p  pBut in that case, when the admin user changes the question and therefore writes a new version of the poll object to the collection, either the update query needs to know it only should update selected fields. Or if overwriting the entire object the admin user should have the latest version of the object since meteor is lastwritewins.p  pAm I missing some best practices around this or is it indeed easier to model my collections the same way I would model a normalized SQL DBp

Negative 4183 pI know that PHP code is compiled to the bytecode and reexecuted on every run i.e. on every page request. So engine should redefine all used classes, functions, variables, etc. on every request.p  pWhen using fullstack frameworks like Laravel or CakePHP this also means that on every request the same bootstrapping work is done again and again, like parsing configuration files, registering routes, autoloading classes, etc.p  pThis seems to be very unoptimal way of handling such stuff. And even caching, be it OPcache or framework caching system, is not helpful enough, because script still needs to be executed.p  pOn the other hand, application based on engines like NodeJS or Ruby compiled and bootstrapped only once during startup. So I imagine they should have better scalability than PHP.p  pBut PHP is so popular and even Facebook uses it.

Ive been working on building an eCommerce using NetBeans but I have customized most of the code suggested by the tutorials to better fit my needs. So far understanding JSTL and JAVA... I was wondering, how do I build breadcrumbs to restrain the number of products that display per pagep  pExamplep  precode24 per page   48 per page   96 per page   View All codepre  pThe number of products will also generate the number of pages there is to display. p  pFor example, if there are code48 productscode for that particular codecategorycode and the user chooses to display code24 products per pagecode, logically the application should display code2 pages.code Anyway, you get the gist of it. p  pHow do I go about adding that logic to my existing application I know it has something to do with codealgorithmscode and probably codejava.stringscode... p  pThanks a lotp

Also, the programs use 2 threads each which are working together in a synchronised manner. The applications are identical, just running on different data. Again, they should be completely independent of each other as each program runs on its own JVM.p  pI am not asking for a specific solution to my problem, but Im interested in finding out if behaviour like this is usual or not.p  pAnd most importantly, if it is a wellknown problem, are there any rulesofthumb on how to avoid problems like this Are there aspects of multithreading in my case, each program uses two threads that are known to cause similar issuesp  pstrongUpdatestrong First of all, heres the code that is used for waitnotify operations between the threads.p  pMain thread, only two methods called in a loopp  precodepublic void waitCyclesint c      worker.setWaitDurationc     try          synchronized this              this.wait500very unlikely to actually wait 500ms.

Negative 4183 pThere are a number of questions about this but, as far as I see, none that address this question.p  pIs it wrong for a domain object to consume an EF Entity to hydrate it On one hand, this is very similar to a memento. An EF Entity can be treated as a DTO or an active record.p  pOn the other hand, this seems to couple the domain to the DAL as EF Entities could be considered DAOsp  pstrongEDITstrong To clarify what Im asking about here... I have a Domain Model that isnt aware of my data access layer. The Repositories return my DOs but those DOs are put together using DTOs. The DTOs are property bags build specifically to be used by repositories to hydrate the DOs. So even though my DOs dont depend on the EF Entities, they depend on DTOs whose sole job is to be mapped from EF entities... so Ive created code solely to facility hydration. This seems a little smelly to me.p  pI am absolutely not asking whether the DO should use an EF to persist itself. Im asking whether or not I can emreadem from an EF Entity to hydrate the DO.p

Negative 4183 pI have built a simple feed aggregator based on query builder. I am looking for pages with specific parameter and add them to a feed. p  pExpected behavior is to set the specific property on a page which has to be added to a feed and activate that page. Feed aggregator has to be published only once, because its content is dynamic and is based on properties of other pages.p  pThis is working fine on my local environment, but unfortunately on production environment I cant see any changes after activation of a page with property, I have to also publish a feed.

I am passing in a date in the following format 20150507 01001300 and want to compare it against the date it is ran. i.e. todays date for this purpose.

Negative 4183 pI have a simple database first MVC application using Entity Framework. Im using codeViewData.ModelState.IsValidcode in the View to capture any errors from the Controller.  The Controller queries the database based on an id and creates an object based on the entity and then returns this to the View.p  pRecently users of the applications were getting unhandled exceptions. This was tracked to a field being removed from a database table, and becoming out of sync with the entity model bad change management I know.  The error was raised by the View when it tries access the removed data field, although the View thinks the model is valid.p  pHow can I ensure that the entity is insync with the database using the controller at runtime so that I can better manage the error. Thanksp
Negative 4183 pStep 1 I am copying a file manually by reading from source then writing to target files in chunk. I keep the file handle open until all copy is not over. The handle is safely closed as copy is over.p  pStep 2 After copy is over, I set the time stamp, attributes, ACL and may more things.p  pSometime in step 2, I get the issue that file is being used by some other process. This issue raise mostly for exe files. I got the answer which process was using that file from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30502845filestreamcloseisnotclosingthefilehandleinstantlyFile locked by other processa. A sper answer, OS locks the file to set the icon or some other information on file for a very minor time.p  pBut if I go to perform step 2 without any delay after finishing step 1 then I get access error. How I can ensure that OS will not lock the filep  pLooping to check for file access is not an solution as per because the locking may be happen at any point of time in step 2. Step 2 is not atomic, there I need to openclose same file multiple times.p

Negative 4183 pFor the past few days, I have been toying with Serial communication using C so I can transfer data from C to an Arduino, so I decided to download Boost for the asio header file.  My question is this how do you link Boost, and in turn boost asio, in Xcode I have tried searching online though, and even after compiling the library, I couldnt figure out how to link the library so that I can include the necessary .hpp file for asio. My main issue lies in not being able to find the proper libraries in the Build Paths. This is, perhaps, because of issues with the Header Search path. Thanks in advance and hope you can help me to figure out this issue. p  pUpdate This question is a duplicate. My problem was remedied by micans answer on the other question page. He solved the problem by deleting the boost folder downloaded from source forge. Then, he downloaded the boost package using homebrew.From there, all he had to do was add strongusrlocalincludestrong to the emHeader Search Pathsem in his targets build settings. From there, all of the code would compile.p

But since I am new in swift I cant see where are the on click actions here or how can I implement the login function without clicking the login button.p  pHere is my codep  precodelet contentURL  httpswww.youtube.comwatchvjBsPZV14Ik let contentURLImage  httpimg.youtube.comvijBsPZV14Ik0.jpg let contentTitle  sdasfdfsa let contentDescription  asdsadasdasd  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      if FBSDKAccessToken.currentAccessToken  nil                 let loginView  FBSDKLoginButton  FBSDKLoginButton         self.view.addSubviewloginView         loginView.center  self.view.center         loginView.readPermissions  [publicprofile, email, userfriends]         loginView.delegate  self         self.returnUserData         self.showShareButtons          else              let loginView  FBSDKLoginButton  FBSDKLoginButton         self.view.addSubviewloginView         loginView.center  self.view.center         loginView.readPermissions  [publicprofile, email, userfriends]         loginView.delegate  self          func loginButtonloginButton FBSDKLoginButton, didCompleteWithResult result FBSDKLoginManagerLoginResult, error NSError      printlnUser Logged In      if error  nil               Process error          else if result.isCancelled           Handle cancellations          else          if result.grantedPermissions.containsemail                       Do work                  self.returnUserData         self.showShareButtons          func loginButtonDidLogOutloginButton FBSDKLoginButton      printlnUser Logged Out   func returnUserData      let graphRequest  FBSDKGraphRequest  FBSDKGraphRequestgraphPath me, parameters nil     graphRequest.startWithCompletionHandler connection, result, error gt Void in            if error  nil                       Process error             printlnError error                  else                      printlnfetched user result             let userName  NSString  result.valueForKeyname as NSString             printlnUser Name is userName             let userEmail  NSString  result.valueForKeyemail as NSString             printlnUser Email is userEmail                 func showShareButtons      self.showLinkButton   func showLinkButton      let content  FBSDKShareLinkContent  FBSDKShareLinkContent     content.contentURL  NSURLstring self.contentURL     content.contentTitle  self.contentTitle     content.contentDescription  self.contentDescription     content.imageURL  NSURLstring self.contentURLImage      let button  FBSDKShareButton  FBSDKShareButton     button.shareContent  content     button.frame  CGRectMakeUIScreen.mainScreen.bounds.width  100  0.5, 50, 100, 25     self.view.addSubviewbutton   codepre

I am using nvd3 1.7.x and have a running multiBarChart with some sources states from a JSON file.

As we got updates in 2015 to 1.7 and there have been some changes to the state functions getter, setter and so on I want to know if this bug still exists and how to use the new functions in the right way. The annotation and the new documentation did not help me out only for deprecated defaultState its told use dispatch.stateChangestate instead.p  hr  pOK, what do i doneed  I want to save changeschoices on the states a user made as a configvariable and then I want to restore these states to the same chartobject wich was updated with different data of another json file having the same states available. My problem is, that the json files have stored default state settings that I need to overwrite in cases a user cycles through data sets  otherwise he needs to select the stream config every change again.p  pExample Lets say we have the chart running with stacked and grouped available and some streams stream1, stream2, stream3. By default the chart loads stacked view and all 3 streams are visible in json file for e.g. 2015. p  precodechart.stacked true chart.state.disabled disabled[false,false,false] codepre  pSo if a user only wants only to compare stream 1 and 3 in different time series, he deactivatesklicks on stream 2p  precodechart.stacked true chart.state.disabled disabled[false,true,false] codepre  pand after that this setting is stored this is working and needs to be restored for the next data set different json file e.g. 2014 this is not working right now. p  hr  pWhat i have is a working chart, that is loading and displaying different json files. The selection is implemented by dropdown list and events are fired by jquery. I am able to save the states by getting values ofp  precodechart.stacked chart.state.disabled chart.reduceXTicks codepre  pWhen I overwrite the saved states i can see the new values in codechart.state.disabledcode but after an codechart.updatecode they are gone and i see the default states from the json file from the initial chart object.p  pI already played around with different functions like the dispatch functions changeState, stateChange but I had no success to keep the values in after a chart update.p  precodeoldStates is a copy of the last states before switching to a new time set json file in the chart. chart.state.disabled  oldStates   works but chart.update overwrites it with default values  chart.defaultStateoldStates  NO changes. marked as DEPRECATED in documentation saying Use chart.dispatch.changeState... instead.  chart.dispatch.changeStateoldStates   No change, not working codepre  pI would be glad in getting any hintstipps how to change states by overwritingchanging single states and update the chart with them, rendering only the new selection.

Negative 4183 pI would like your comments on the use of promises in a part of my code.p  pI have a View, lets call it codeFoocode. codeFoocode implements Interface codeEmbeddableViewcode. I have Foo embedded in view codeBarcode. codeFoocode is unaware that it is embedded anywhere and  codeBarcode does not care about the content of codeFoocode, only if its valid or not.  The way this happends is the interface codeEmbeddableViewcode has a codefunctioncode like codegetValidationPromisecode returning a promise.p  pWhen view codeFoocode resolves the promise, codebarcode is notified that its content either rendered invalid or valid. p  pHowever, that validation state change is not a one time thing. It will jump back and forth. It is no longer a promise on the completion of an operation. It can fail, refail, success and maybe fail again. Would you say promises is still a meaningful way of implementing this p  pAny comments about how this could be implemented in typescriptjavascript in a meaningful way is appreciated. p

However domainIT is not a role its an active directory group So framework denies the access and I get windows login prompt again. and keeps asking for credentials because it goes through the same cyclebr So Im not sure how can I tell framework not to invoke custom role provider when its looking if user is in active directory group. p  pEDITbr If I remove role provide from configuration then user gets authenticated without any issue.p
