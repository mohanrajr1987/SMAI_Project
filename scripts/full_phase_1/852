Positive 852 pI have read many posts on here and done many Google searches but I am still unable to read a file from another java package within my current project.p  pIn one of my classes I have the following code, however the input stream is always null. I have tried using the context class loader, as well as many other solutions but to no avail.p  precodeInputStream is  this.getClass.getResourceAsStream opcodes.txt    System.out.printlnis codepre  pAnother attempt wasp  precodeInputStream is  ClassName.class.getResourcceAsStreamresourcesopcodes.txt codepre  pwhich also returned null.p  pAny help or explanation for why I can not find the file within a resource package would be great.p  pp.s. I am using eclipse if that makes a difference.p  pEDIT If I use an OpenFileDialog to find the file, I am able to open and read it, so the file does exist and is not corrupt.p
Positive 852 pI am trying to add an icon to an .NET exe built in the Visual Studio, but somehow it does not work.p  pHere are steps to reproduce the problem 1. I created a new Windows Form Application application  New Project  Windows Form Application  2. Open the resources in it Right click on Solution  Properties  Resources 3. Tried to add an icon file to it Icons  Add Resources  Add Exising File and chose an existing icon.p  pIt appeared that the icon was added. So, I build the exe file and closed the solution, but the resulting exe file did not contain the icon in the Windows resources. I verified that by opening the exe file by Visual Studio. The Visual Studio showed resources to me, which contained the manifest and version, but no icon.p  pThe question what am I doing wrong Why does the added icon not appear in the Windows resourcesp

However, I havent been able to find any clear cut documentation on it.p  pAll the examples Ive found are surrounded in nonBLE code, so its hard for me to decipher which is BLE code and which is not, especially since Ive never done anything in BLE, though I have in Bluetooth Classic.p  pIf you guys have any good resources such as, wiki, javadocs, videos, simple examples, or anything of the such. Can you please list it here.p  pThanks.p

Positive 852 pI know each GPU has its theoretical limitation about the threads and threadsPerBlock. But in most of the cases, we would not hit that limitation because of resource limitation. Basically there are three kinds of resources that might be used by a kernel, registers, global memory and shared memory.p  pAssuming we didnt use any share memory at all, the remaining constraint would be registers and global memory. I knew CUDA would do automatically registers spilling when SM runs out of its own resources. In this way, it seems like the hard limitation for number of launched threads would be the capacity of the global memory. Despite the potential bad performance herep  pIs that true p

Negative 852 pI have a situation where a single Oracle system is the data master for two seperate CRM Systems PeopleSoft amp Siebel.

Sometimes the HTTP 200 means... yes I have received and comitted the data.  Using HTTP, there can be issues with ordere dlivery.  All of tese problems could have been solved with a lot of architehtural planning up front.  It was not done.  There are no updatecreate timestamps to prevent unordered delivery from stepping on data.  There is no full round trip acknowledgement of data commi from destinatin systems.

Negative 852 pThe problem We want to bind a HierarchicalDataTemplates ItemsSource property to a CollectionViewSource, to perform grouping and filtering.p  pThe background The original issue we were working on had to do with filtering a TreeView. Specifically, we found that using a CollectionViewSource to filter worked but caused the TreeView nodes to collapse. Its likely because the Views Refresh function regenerates its list of objects which causes the TreeView to regenerate its nodes, causing the original nodes expansion states to be lost. We resolved this by writing a class that is similar to CollectionViewSource but preserves the View by editing the object list in place so that when it changes due to filtering, the associated TreeView nodes arent destroyed.p  pThis has worked perfectly for us and wed like to use it at deeper levels in our TreeView, bringing us back to our problem. Currently, we have a HierarchicalDataTemplate that looks like thisp  precodeltHierarchicalDataTemplate      xKeytableTemplate      ItemsSourceBinding PathDataItems      ItemTemplateSelectorStaticResource tableGroupsTemplateSelector      gt codepre  pInstead, we want it to behave like thisp  precodeltHierarchicalDataTemplate      xKeytableTemplate      ItemTemplateSelectorStaticResource tableGroupsTemplateSelector      gt      ltHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemsSourcegt          ltBindinggt              ltBinding.Sourcegt                  ltCollectionViewSource                      SourceBinding PathDataItems                      gt              ltBinding.Sourcegt          ltBindinggt      ltHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemsSourcegt codepre  pUnfortunately, this approach doesnt seem to work. From what we can tell, the binding within the CVS never fires no binding errors are raised we tried attaching a converter and setting a breakpoint but the breakpoint was never hit. Weve also tried various other solutions, including using RelativeSource, moving the CollectionViewSource into the templates Resources, and incorporating TreeViewItems into the template. However, nothing has worked.p  pAs an aside, I do realize that a ViewModel approach would enable filtering. However, Im at a place in our development cycle where I cant make that type of change so Im looking for alternatives, like the CollectionViewSource approach.p  pAny help you can give would be appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pCraigp

Once you tab off the browser menu, the first tab item becomes the calendar web part, skipping over the menu item and all other content.p  pIve tried setting tab index to 1, 0, 1 on the div with the menu that I want hit first, but the calendar web part still gets the first tab, forcing users who tab through pages to have to cycle through all controls to get to the accessible mode menu.p  pAny ideas what else I could do to make sure this loads as the first item tabbed to, no matter whatp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 852 pIm developing in LAMP LinuxApacheMySQLPHP since I remember myself. But one question was bugging me for years now. I hope you can help me to find an answer and point me into the right direction. Here is my challengep  pSay, we are creating a community website, where we allow our users to register. The MySQL table where we store all users would look then like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE users    uid int2 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement COMMENT User ID,   name varchar20 NOT NULL,   password varchar32 NOT NULL COMMENT Password is saved as a 32bytes hash, never in plain text,   email varchar64 NOT NULL,   created int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of registration,   updated int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of profile update, e.g. change of email,   PRIMARY KEY  uid  ENGINEMyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pSo, from this snippet you can see that we have a unique and automatically incrementing for every new user uid field. As on every good and loyal community website we need to provide users with possibility to completely delete their profile if they want to cancel their participation in our community.p  pHere comes my problem. Lets say we have 3 registered users Alice uid  1, Bob uid  2 and Chris uid  3. Now Bob want to delete his profile and stop using our community. If we delete Bobs profile from the users table then his missing uid will create a gap which will be never filled again. In my opinion its a huge waste of uids. I see 3 possible solutions herep  p1 Increase the capacity of the uid field in our table from SMALLINT int2 to, for example, BIGINT int8 and ignore the fact that some of the uids will be wasted.p  p2 introduce the new field isdeleted, which will be used to mark deleted profiles but keep them in the table, instead of deleting them to reutilize their uids for newly registered users. The table will look then like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE users    uid int2 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement COMMENT User ID,   name varchar20 NOT NULL,   password varchar32 NOT NULL COMMENT Password is saved as a 32bytes hash, never in plain text,   email varchar64 NOT NULL,   isdeleted int1 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT If equal to 1 then the profile has been deleted and will be reused for new registrations,   created int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of registration,   updated int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of profile update, e.g. change of email,   PRIMARY KEY  uid  ENGINEMyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  p3 Write a script to shift all following user records once a previous record has been deleted. E.g. in our case when Bob uid  2 decides to remove his profile, we would replace his record with the record of Chris uid  3, so that uid of Chris becomes qual to 2 and mark isdeleted  1 the old record of Chris as vacant for the new users. In this case we keep the chronological order of uids according to the registration time, so that the older users have lower uids.p  pPlease, advice me now which way is the right way to handle the gaps in the autoincrement fields. This is just one example with users, but such cases occur very often in my programming experience.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 852 pI have downloaded the latest Eclipse 3.6 for my Linux machine and extracted tar.gz to the opteclipse directory as root. I started Eclipse as a normal user and successfully installed some plugins through Eclipse. The plugins are visible under Installed software from Eclipse, but they doesnt seem to be working  no new perspectives that should be there, no features, nothing.  Then I looked inside my home folder and found the following directoryp  p.eclipseorg.eclipse.platform3.5.01473617060p  pThat directory structure looks similar to the one in the opteclipse where Eclipse is installed and has 4 directories inside dropins, configuration, plugins, features and one file artifacts.xml.

An employee may, or may not, be a member of one teamp  precodeGET team  returns a list of teams POST team  creates a new team GET team1  returns a list of employees in the team with the ID 1  GET employee  returns a list of employees POST employee  creates a new employee GET employee1  returns details about the employee with the ID 1 codepre  pBehind this I have some Hibernate annotated POJOs one for team, and one for employee, with a 1N relationship between the two remember that an Employee may not be a member of a team. The same POJOs are also annotated as XmlRootElements so that JAXB will allow me to pass them tofrom the client as JSON.p  pThe properties for the two entities look like thisp  precodeTeam     Long id     String name     String desc     ListltEmployeegt employees  Employee     Long id     Team team     String name     String phone     String email codepre  pAll good so far. But Im struggling to understand how to make an employee a member of a team at creationtime by just passing in a Team ID, rather than passing in a nested team object in my JSON object.p  pFor example, Id like to be able to call POST employee with a JSON that looks like thisp  precode     teamid1,     nameFred Bloggs,     phone1234567890,     emailtestexample.com  codepre  pBut, instead, I have to pass in something like thisp  precode     team         id1,              nameFred Bloggs,     phone1234567890,     emailtestexample.com  codepre  pSo, my question is, how do others handle creating relationships in JSONREST without passing around whole object graphsp  pSorry this is such a sketchy question, but as I say, Im just starting out, and terminology is a problem for me at this stagep

Ive seen a lot of examples on the web and I just dont get it. mi mind is blocked to the idea maybe.p  pJust take a look at the Ninject Home pages examplep  precodepublic class Samurai      public IWeapon Weapon  get private set      public SamuraiIWeapon weapon          Weapon  weapon        public class WarriorModule  NinjectModule      public override void Load          Bindlt IWeapon gt.Tolt Sword gt       codepre  pThe Samurai class is ok to me.

Negative 852 pEdited Question  I am working on a multithreaded JMS receiver and publisher code stand alone multithreaded java application. MOM is MQSonic. XML message is received from a Queue, stored procedurestakes 70 sec to execute are called and response is send to Topic within 90 sec.  I need to handle a condition when broker is down or application is on scheduled shutdown. i.e. a condition in which messages are received from Queue and are being processed in java, in the mean time both Queue and Topic will be down. Then to handle those messages which are not on queue and not send to topic but are in java memory, I have following optionsp  p1  To create CLIENTACKNOWLEDGE session as  connection.createSessionfalse, javax.jms.Session.CLIENTACKNOWLEDGE Here I will acknowledge message only after the successful completion of transactionsstored proceduresp  p2  To use transacted session i.e., connection.createSessiontrue, 1. In this approach because of some exception in transaction stored procedure the message is rolled back and Redelivered. They are rolled back again and again and continue until I kill the program.  Can I limit the number of redelivery of jms messages from queuep  pAlso in above two approached which one is betterp

Negative 852 pI am working with reporting code written in sql. The base of all reporting used to be a table with 6 rows.

This does not seem an elegant solution.p  pWhat is the best way to do this in Java Either in code or using an XSLT.p

Negative 852 pI have a program that needs to load files from a directory as soon as they are written.  I got the FileSystemWatcher to notify me of changes to the directory.  Rather than check the event for what changed I just list the files and start processing all that I found.p  pTo prevent trying to read a file which is still being written I have code likep  precodetry      fs  fi.OpenFileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite,                     FileShare.None     message  new byte[fs.Length]     int br  fs.Readmessage, 0, intfi.Length  catch Exception e       Ill get it next time around     return  finally      if fs  null         fs.Close  codepre  pThe problem is that for some files, about 1 in 200, the program read all zeros.  File length is correct but the content appear to be all zero bytes.  When I check the file latter I find it does contain actual correct data.  I thought the way I was opening the file would prevent premature access to the file.p  pIm testing this by copying files to the directory with the DOS command copy InFile0 dropdir  About 100 files per execution.  Possibly this command does the copy in two steps  1 allocate space and 2 fill space and my program occasionally jumps in the middle of the two.p  pAny ideas on how to code this to be reliablep  pstrongUpdatestrong  I dont have control over the writing program  it could be anything.

So far I have used the hlink with the id as a parameter and I set them in the show page as viewParams. p  pThe whole application works but I have a question. Currently I am doing the EJB invocation that finds the appropiate car from the ID in the setmethod for a car ID in the backing bean.

Negative 852 pstrongWhat I wantstrong I have an EditText, where the user can enter a value, such as 10.40. Once the user is done editing I am formatting his input to a currency, for instance the above mentioned value would get formatted to 10.40 in the case of Locale.US. And I display that result in the same EditText that the user previously edited.p  pstrongProblemstrong Because I am going to format i.e. modify his input, I need to know when hes done so my formatting does not interfer with his ongoing input. p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong TextWatcher is not an option, since it fires on every single edit, hence when the user enters one, zero, four, dot and zero 10.40. I am currently using an OnFocusChangeListener which works as desired, BUT the problem is I have buttons in my application and if the user clicks on a button after editing the EditText the EditText wont lose Focus, hence my formatting code never gets called ...p  pAfter this I tried messing around with the buttons focus, setting it to FocusableInTouchMode  which results in the button having to be clicked twice in order to fire which is a no go, since it gains focus the first time and gets activated the second time. After so much hacking around I was wondering if anyone got an idea as how to solve this dilemma.p  pstrongSome Codestrongp  pI add the following OnFocusChangeListener to my EditText whose function I described above. The EditText is encapsulated within a CurrencyTextbox which is not really relevantp  precodeOverride protected OnFocusChangeListener getOnFocusChangeListener      return new OnFocusChangeListener          Override         public void onFocusChangeView v, boolean hasFocus              if hasFocus                  Member variable in the class which contains an EditText                 CurrencyTextbox.this.hadFocus  true              else                   Thes EditText has lost focus                 Log.vTAG, Lost focus.                 if CurrencyTextbox.this.hadFocus                       We previously had focus, now we lost it, format the user input                      Get current value of the Textbox                     String value  CurrencyTextbox.this.textbox.getText.toString                      Formatting the user input                     value  String.formatDoing some formatting                      Reset the had focus                     CurrencyTextbox.this.hadFocus  false                                              codepre  pThe problem however is, the above OnFocusChangelistener only gets called if my EditText loses focus, but it does NOT lose focus when I click on a button in my Activity, and as stated above, it is not feasible to set the Buttons isFocusableInTouchMode to true, as it then needs to be clicked twice every time to fire.p

Negative 852 pCurrently in doing some code review of stuff taken over from another team and have one doubt about applying SRP and its relation to anemic or rich domain model as defined by Martin Fowler.  Rich domain model concept is to have intelligent object that can not only setget their properties but also can perform some more complicated business logic. I wond how it fits into SRPp  pSay I have my model class having some properties that can expose those props and provide some simple calculations on its properies.

This is fine when Im accessing the site directly, and works as expected with the exception of Digest, which appears to be utterly buggered. Via cURL, though, Ive had no luck unless Im already logged in.p  pObviously, for an API, this is far from ideal. I dont want to post a request to codelogincode before doing what I want to do, and I cant expect a user to log in manually so Cake has a cookie to read. It needs to be stateless.p  pAny attempt to supply authentication credentials along with each request I make via cURL is ignored and I get a 403 error in return. Neither the codelogincode method or any of the codeAuthcode classes are touched.p  pWhat do I need to do to make Cake behave like an actual API and allow me to authorise statelessly on a per request basis Am I going to have to roll my own solutionp

Negative 852 pIm relatively new to web programming.  New to Javascript, PHP, Ajax, etc.  I have been searching Google to a seemingly simple solution to this problem for a while now, but have given up.  I believe there is a race condition happening, but everything related to race conditions and PHP and Javascript seem to have a casebycase solution.p  pHeres the setup I have a PHP page that outputs a table.  In one of the rows in one of the tables, I fill a cell with an additional table.  It has 5 cells, and I would like to change the colors of the cells to reflect the signal strength of wifi cards on a machine there are currently only two cards. So after a table has been filled and the ids of the cells have been set, I call a javascript function that posts another piece of PHP code to cat procnetwireless, parse and return the signal strength of the card I have called.p  pThe problem The javascript and PHP code that parses the wireless cards, gets the cell IDs and set the colors works fine for one card.  However, when I call the Javascript function from within a  tag in PHP, only the last call does anything.  The first seems to do nothing.p  pIm completely stumped, and have exhausted all my Google search terms...p  pPHP codep  precodeltphp includeassetsheader.inc.php gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcltphp echo JSgtajaxhomedisplay.jsgtltscriptgt ltdiv idcmbody onloadreturn falsegt     ltphp         apintf  rtrimshellexeccat tmpconfig  grep APDEV  cut d f2         meshintf  rtrimshellexeccat tmpconfig  grep MESHDEV  cut d f2         uptime  rtrimshellexecuptime  awk print 3  cut d, f1      function displaystatusintfintf, name                  global uptime         packetsuccess  100          echo          lttrgt         lttd stylefontsize14px fontweightboldgtltpregtintf [name]ltpregtlttdgt         lttd idsigstatusintfgt         lttable idintfstatus class  list cellpadding10gt         lttd idsigst1intfgtlttdgt         lttd idsigst2intfgtlttdgt         lttd idsigst3intfgtlttdgt         lttd idsigst4intfgtlttdgt         lttd idsigst5intfgtlttdgt         lttablegt         lttdgtltpregtuptimeltpregtlttdgtlttdgt         lttd styletextaligncentergtltpre idpacketsuccessintfgtpacketsuccessltpregtlttdgt         lttrgt         ltscriptgtupdateinterfaceintfltscriptgt                             Make a table         echo lttable classlist cellpadding1gt         echo lttrgtltthgtInterfaceltthgtltthgtSignal StatusltthgtltthgtUptimeltthgtltthgtPacket successltthgtlttrgt              Make a row on the table for the first wifi card wifi0             if apintf                 displaystatusintfapintf, AP           Add a blank row         echo lttrgtlttd colspan7 height30pxgtlttdgtlttrgt              Make a row on the table for the second wifi card wifi1             if meshintf                 displaystatusintfmeshintf, Mesh          echo lttablegt     gt   ltdivgt ltphp includeassetsfooter.inc.php gt codepre  pJavascript codep  precode    THRESH1  60     THRESH2  55     THRESH3  50     THRESH4  45      function updateinterfaceintf              xmlhttpPostruninterfacestatus.php,intfintf,interfacestatresponse           function interfacestatresponsestrQuery,strResponse              var sigst  []           Trim response         var testreturn  strResponse         var intface  strQuery.split         var intf  intface[1]           Get cell IDs, put in an array sigst         for i1ilt5i              sigst[i]  document.getElementByIdsigstiintf          Reset all colors to default         for i1ilt2i             sigst[i].setAttributestyle, backgroundcolortransparent          if testreturn  err               Set all colors based on the wifi strength             sigst[1].setAttributestyle, backgroundcolorred              if testreturn gt THRESH1                 sigst[2].setAttributestyle, backgroundcolororange             if testreturn gt THRESH2                 sigst[3].setAttributestyle, backgroundcoloryellow             if testreturn gt THRESH3                 sigst[4].setAttributestyle, backgroundcolorgreen             if testreturn gt THRESH4                 sigst[5].setAttributestyle, backgroundcolorgreen               codepre  pThe Ajax heavy lifting if it mattersp  precode    function xmlhttpPoststrURL,strQuery,responseFunc              var xmlHttpReq  false         var self  this          MozillaSafari         if window.XMLHttpRequest              self.xmlHttpReq  new XMLHttpRequest                   IE         else if window.ActiveXObject              self.xmlHttpReq  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                  self.xmlHttpReq.openPOST, strURL, true         self.xmlHttpReq.setRequestHeaderContentType, applicationxwwwformurlencoded         self.xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange  function              if self.xmlHttpReq.readyState  4                  responseFuncstrQuery,self.xmlHttpReq.responseText                               self.xmlHttpReq.sendstrQuery           function trims              s  s.replacessgi,         s  s.replace[ ]2,gi,          s  s.replacen ,n         return s      codepre  pSome additional information  I believe it to be a race condition since Firebug shows that two posts have been fired, each returning the correct values, but when I place a breakpoint in the beginning of the response function interfacestatresponse, Firebug only falls in it once with the latter intf and strength variables wifi1s stuff.p  pAlso any general pointers would be great.

Negative 852 pheres the deal, I have to make a game that resembles PacMan, with a map, points, ghosts, etc. The whole thing works as an array[8][8], it reads the positions of walls and the initial position of ghosts from a .txt file, PacMan starts at a fixed location and Fruits are random. Any blank space at the beginning of the game gets filled with a simple point pellet. Ive got the map done, it shows it and everything, but I cant seem to come up with a method that allows the player to control PacMan with the keyboard... This is what Ive tried so far... In the Player classp  precodeBufferedReader read  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderSystem.in String mov  read.readLine if mov.equalsw    PacMan.MoveU  codepre  pIt then repeats that for the other movement keys.p  pThe individual Move methods in PacMan class look like thisp  precodepublic static void MoverR    for int i0iltTablero.lengthi        for int j0jltTablero.lengthj            if Tablero[i][j] instanceof PacMan         Tablero[i][j]null         Tablero[i][j1]new PacMan                 codepre  pThis obviously isnt working, so Im wondering if anyone can help me with a more efficient way to do this I really dont mind starting these two classes from scratch...

They are always there when I start the dialog, and they always vanish once I scroll. p  pThe weird thing is that my list row consists of a few TextViews in 2 rows and its only the bottom row TextViews that dissapear...Any ideas  p  pCode for my dialogp  precode itemSendPickerDialog  new Dialogthis     AlertDialog.Builder builder  new AlertDialog.Builderthis    builder.setTitleSelect Item to Send     ListView lv  new ListViewthis     Cursor c  mDbHelper.fetchItemsByDateid     c.moveToFirst      int i  R.layout.senditemmenurow     MyListAdapter ia  new MyListAdapterthis, mainListBackground, c, true     lv.setAdapteria      builder.setViewlv     itemSendPickerDialog  builder.create     itemSendPickerDialog.show codepre  pAnd my custom list adapter classp  precodeclass MyListAdapter extends ResourceCursorAdapter      public MyListAdapterContext context, int i, Cursor cursor, boolean...sending          supercontext, i, cursor           Override     public void bindViewView view, Context context, Cursor cursor           TextView title  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.itemname          title.setTextcursor.getStringcursor.getColumnIndexTripsDbAdapter.KEYITEMTITLE          Display display  WindowManager context.getSystemServiceContext.WINDOWSERVICE.getDefaultDisplay         int width  display.getWidth         width  width  150         ViewGroup.LayoutParams params  title.getLayoutParams         params.width  width         title.setLayoutParamsparams          String cat  cursor.getStringcursor.getColumnIndexTripsDbAdapter.KEYITEMCATEGORY         if cat.equalsIgnoreCasetrip notes              LinearLayout ll  LinearLayout view.findViewByIdR.id.itemdatetimeholder             ll.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE                  TextView date  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.itemdate         date.setTextcursor.getStringcursor.getColumnIndexTripsDbAdapter.KEYDEPDATE          TextView time  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.itemtime         time.setTextcursor.getStringcursor.getColumnIndexTripsDbAdapter.KEYDEPTIME          ImageView iv  ImageView view.findViewByIdR.id.imageicon         if iv  null              int index  cursor.getColumnIndexTripsDbAdapter.KEYITEMTYPE              String type  cursor.getStringindex             if type  null                else                  type  notes                           iv.setImageResourcegetTypeResourcetype                 codepre

Negative 852 pI am using a Multitenant Application for various companies . I am yet to get success with this . But what my scenario is I have a single sql server database with tablesets with different companies tenants. p  pSo what I want to do is add a convention for table which would access the table with its schema prefix in the table as per multitenant application concept . I am not using database per tenant but using schema per tenant . Database file is a single file . p  pWhat I want to do is my tables are like this codeSachin Sales amp Service Pvt LtdWeb User Setup Headercode. so I want when the table queries would be generated they should add prefix codeSachin Sales amp Service Pvt Ltdcode on fly before querying . The prefix may change on requirement . Its not static . So I thought of overriding IClassConvention which by default looks like this p  precode public class TableNameConvention  IClassConvention      public void ApplyIClassInstance instance              instance.Table instance.EntityType.Name       codepre  pIs there anyway I can pass another parameter like codestring schemanamecode like this to generate the desired tablename with schema prefix  My idea is to do something like this p  precodepublic class TableNameConvention  IClassConvention      public void ApplyIClassInstance instance, string schemaname               instance.Tableschemaname  instance.EntityType.Name       codepre  pIf so my questions are here like this . If i am able to achieve the point mentioned above will it solve my schema per tenant problem   And second even if the above doesnt give any errors while compiling technically shouldnt how am I supposed to pass schemaname into that override  I mean how should I call since This is just a convention and I cannot manipulate it on fly which I actually want to dop

Negative 852 pIm using jQuery to manage the Edit button on comments for an app Im coding. In my codedocument.readycode, I havep  precode.editbutton.clickfunction  Code to trigger the editing interface for parent comment  codepre  pIm also using jQuery to display newlyposted comments without refreshing the page. Within the relevant code.ajaxcode function, I write the new comment to the DOM using a code.beforedatacode. Problem is, the code.editbuttoncodes within codedatacode dont have the aforementioned code.clickcode applied to them, because that happens in codedocument.readycode. So I click on them, and nothing happens.p  pIve tried the extremely ugly solution of having the Ajax function reinclude the .js file in which I call codedocument.readycode. This works, except it reapplies the code.clickcode to every single code.editbuttoncode, so they open the editing interface twice or even three times.p  pSo, how can I reapply the code.clickcodes from codedocument.readycode Preferably without having to copypasta my codedocument.readycode function into another javascript file, in case I modify it later.p

Negative 852 pI have an unmanaged C DLL originally written in MSVC 6.0.  It has a couple classes and a few standalone C functions which I need to call from C .NET 4.0.  I have had several false starts on this.  I know there are several ways to do this Convert to COM, MC wrapper, PInvoke but it hasnt been entirely clear which is the most straightforward.  My current approach is to convert the C DLL to ActiveX control.  The issue Ive run into is that when trying to recreate the methods in a VS 2010 C ActiveX project the Class Wizard does not allow any return types except fundamental types, CString or pointer to CWnd.  How do I return either a copy of a structure or a pointer to a structure  It doesnt seem possible to return as a parameter either since the types for the method parameters have the same type limitations as the return type.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlvDdr.png altAllowed ActiveX Return Typesp

Negative 852 pLast week I wanted to learn how to make an application for Android, so I downloaded the SDK, Eclipse and all the tools I was needing. I created a webapplication which I published in the Play Store. Now I want to make something more complex, and I created a new project with Swipe ViewTitle Strip activity.  I learned how to rename them, how to add many items in the menu and so on. BUT Ive got a big problem. For example, how can I make each item in the menu to show a different webpage using webview. Please show me an example, so I can start learning. I searched the web and I looked on the android development help, but couldnt find any help just general terms. Thanks in advancep

If the user has read access then just a normal details view is displayed, if read and edit access then the user can see a details view or can edit the data.p  pIs something like this possible  I have tried looking through a couple of starter kits that I found on Codeplex but I cant find something like I want.  How would this be implemented  If possible, if anyone knows of any sample project that I can download then I will appreciate.

Instead, I have to manually pass instance of Utils to every instance of every object that is created during runtime.p  pThe only way around it that I can see is using the antipattern of passing the IoC container around, which I certainly wouldnt want to do.p  pIs there another way Or am I forced to pass Utils manually around to every instance and classp  pstrongNotestrong This isnt a question of design.

The timer will be a sky with a sun on top, and clouds will go over top of it at some point also.    p  pIf you could give me tips and help me out along the way that would be great even if you just correct a few little things here and there.  p  pThank you. p  precodepublic class gameGUI extends JPanel      private ArrayListltBufferedImagegt nativeOne  new ArrayListltBufferedImagegt     private ArrayListltBufferedImagegt nativeTwo  new ArrayListltBufferedImagegt     private ArrayListltBufferedImagegt nativeThree  new ArrayListltBufferedImagegt     private ArrayListltBufferedImagegt exoticOne  new ArrayListltBufferedImagegt     private ArrayListltBufferedImagegt exoticTwo  new ArrayListltBufferedImagegt     private ArrayListltBufferedImagegt exoticThree  new ArrayListltBufferedImagegt      private static int screenWidth  680     private static int screenHeight  680      private JLayeredPane layeredPane      public gameGUI                 layeredPane  new JLayeredPane         layeredPane.setPreferredSizenew Dimension680, 680         layeredPane.setBackgroundColor.GREEN         layeredPane.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.BLACK,2                   private static JLayeredPane timer         JLayeredPane timer  new JLayeredPane         timer.setPreferredSizenew Dimension800,120         timer.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.BLACK, 2         timer.setBackgroundColor.BLUE         return timer           private static JPanel sideBar         Create the side bar and add buttons         JPanel returnMofo  new JPanel         JButton nativeOne  new JButtonnative1         JButton nativeTwo  new JButtonnative2         JButton nativeThree  new JButtonnative3         JButton exoticOne  new JButtonexotic1         JButton exoticTwo  new JButtonexotic2         JButton exoticThree  new JButtonexotic3         returnMofo.setLayoutnew GridLayout6,1         returnMofo.setPreferredSizenew Dimension120, 680         returnMofo.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorder Color.BLACK, 2         returnMofo.addnativeOne         returnMofo.addnativeTwo         returnMofo.addnativeThree         returnMofo.addexoticOne         returnMofo.addexoticTwo         returnMofo.addexoticThree         return returnMofo            private static void createAndShowGUI         JFrame frame  new JFrame         frame.setTitleStorm Watch         frame.setSize800, 800         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         gameGUI gui  new gameGUI         frame.addtimer, BorderLayout.NORTH         frame.addsideBar, BorderLayout.WEST         frame.addgui, BorderLayout.EAST                                  frame.pack         frame.setVisibletrue           public static void mainString[] args             createAndShowGUI                           codepre

Negative 852 pI have a elf binary which has been statically linked to libc. I do not have access to its C code. I would like to use OpenOnload library, which has implementation of sockets in userspace and therefore provides lower latency compared to standard libc versions. OpenOnload implements standard socket api, and overrides libc version using LDPRELOAD. But, since this elf binary is statically linked, it cannot use the OpenOnload version of the socket API.p  pI believe that converting this binary to dynamically link with OpenOnload is possible, with the following stepsp  ol liAdd new Program headers PTINTERP, PTDYNAMIC and PTLOAD.li liAdd entries in PTDYNAMIC to list dependency with libc.li liAdd PLT stubs for required libc functions in the new PTLOAD section.li liModify existing binary code for libc functions to jump to corresponding PLT stubs.li ol  pAs a first cut, I tried just adding 3 PTLOAD segments. New segment headers were added after existing PTLOAD segment headers. Also, vmaddr of existing segments was not modified. File offsets of existing segments were shifted below to next aligned address based on palign. New PTLOAD segments were added in the file at end of the file.p  pAfter rewriting the file, when I ran it, it was loaded properly by the kernel, but then it immediately segfaulted.p  pMy questions arep  ol liIf I just shift the fileoffsets in the elf binary, without modifying the vmaddresses, can it cause any error while running the binaryli liIs it possible to do what I am attempting Has anybody attempted itli ol

Negative 852 pI am attempting to create a div element and when it is clicked it creates a new element. In my case the new element is a styled strongpstrong element. When the strongpstrong element is clicked it creates a new stronglistrong element within the strongpstrong element. I made this work by having one large function but I am attempting to structure my code. My new structuring is clarifying but presenting me problems.p  pThe below code works except when I click on the grey circles it does not create a new small green circle, which is what it should do. The error I get says the synth variable is not accessible. However, when I make the synth variable global I get another problem, I can only launch the strongcreateSynthstrong function once.... and hence I cant create multiple grey circles.p  pSo in short I think the trick is to make the synth variable local and globally accessible or at least accessible to the function that needs it...global variables are BAD From what Ive read this is the perfect case for using a closure.

FROM SupplierProduct sp JOIN Supplier s ON s.Id  sp.SupplierId WHERE sp.ProductId  1 codepre  pCan my linq to entities query be changed to produce the above SQLp

Negative 852 pOkay, so Im still learning the basics of programming. Still learning to use pseudocode. I have read, and practised to write pseudocode operations. I still get so confused, and when I ask questions to my instructor I feel like I bother her. Maybe this is not the case, but this is how I always feel whenever I have questions, but Im trying to break that barrier. So Im going to give an example from my book, and Ill make some questions see if someone can help me understand.p  pThe example is about inserting records into a sequential file. My textbook saysp  pLets assume that the contents of the grades file lists records alphabetically according to student name. Suppose a new student joins the class. Now we need to insert a new record. We must place data in each field of that record. In this example, grades has two fieldsone for the students name and one for the students score. So we want to insert values that are stored in the variables called NewName and NewScore. These values will be entered by the user and will be inserted into this file at the appropriate place, retaining alphabetical order.p  pThen, it express the pseudocodep  precode1  Declare NewName As String 2  Declare NewScore As Integer 3  Open grades For Input As GivenFile 4  Open scratch For Output As TempFile 5  Write Enter name and score for the new student  6  Input NewName, NewScore 7  Set Inserted  0 8  While NOT EOFGivenFile AND Inserted  0 9    Read GivenFile, Student, Score  10    If NewName lt Student Then 11       Write TempFile, NewName, NewScore 12      Set Inserted  1 13     End If 14   Write TempFile, Student, Score  15 End While 16 If Inserted  0 Then 17   Write TempFile, NewName, NewScore  18 End If 19 While NOT EOFGivenFile 20   Read GivenFile, Student, Score  21   Write TempFile, Student, Score 22 End While 23 Close GivenFile, TempFile  24 Copy scratch onto grades codepre  pI dont understand line 3 and 4, why one is Input and the other is Output I thought Input is what is going to be inserted in the program, and output is the results of what it was inserted in the program.p  pAlso, I have used the relational operators just with numbers, so Im getting confused now that I see them as it is on line 10. What is it trying to tell me Is NewName lt Student telling me if there is a new student to then write the TempFile, Student, and Scorep  pIn the first While loop is giving a Inserted  1, then it ends the loop. Then repeats the Inserted  0 line 16, does this means in case there is another new student to repeat the while loop I really got lost on this one.p  pAt the end, why do we have to copy scratch onto gradesp  pIm sorry for all the questions, Im so confused, and Im taking the classes online, which I have to teach myself, and I have nobody to discuss this with. p  pNote This have nothing to do with an assignment, just trying to understand better the logic of programming.p

Negative 852 pI read a question from a book that said If the OS closes a file after the program terminates, why does the programmer need to close a file manually i.e. call codefile.closecodep  pThe only reason I could come up with is that the program may not terminate correctly, and so the file may be still open, therefore consuming system resources, because the file is kept on a buffer.p  pAre there any other reasonsp  pEDIT I thought of another reason. Calling codefile.closecode obliges the OS to flush to disk any changes that havent been committed to the file.p

Negative 852 pThis question may be a little generalised, but Id like to get some ideas on how to go about this. p  pBasically Ive developed a hybrid iOS app where the iOS end of it is simply a UIWebView with some extra bolt ons that get data from various parts of the UI webview and display them to the user in different ways. p  pThe application allows you to update real time states of various things, so there is a drop down menu that has options likep  precode Empty  Full  Unavailable codepre  pThe problem is that in the environment that this is now being used in there is very patchy cellular connection and no wireless networking. So what I would like to do is for the web app to check wether or not there is connectivity and if there isnt to cache the data locally. I believe I can do this with the HTML5 app cache And then when there is connectivity again Id like it to check the cache file for new data and submit it. p  pIs this possible or do I need to look elsewhere If it is possible, Does anybody have any advice or tips to help Your helpadvice is much appreciated.p  pEDITp  pAlternatively is there a way for me to grab AJAX POST data from within the UIWebView and then store it so I can submit it when the application finds connectivity againp

Negative 852 pI am having a strange issue where I have a thread being used to listen for incoming messages on a socket. The thread is declared globally but instantiated inside method listen. This allows me to interrupt it from another method stopListen which works perfectly the first time, however when listen and stopListen are called a second time it does not appear to get interrupted. The code commented as Do some stuff still executes after waiting for the incoming message the second time. Below is a cut down version of the code.p  precodepublic class Con      private Thread listen      public void listen          listen  new Threadnew Runnable              Override             public void run                  while Thread.interrupted                      Wait for an incoming message                     if Thread.interrupted                         Do some stuff                                                                     listen.start           public void stopListen          listen.interrupt       codepre  pI understand its a bit weird having a variable and a method called the same thing.

Negative 852 pCiao, I am trying to accomplish this I would be able to know wich 3d object is double clicked in my scene, and animate camera position to bring the object in the center of the screen.p  pI tried without success to adapt the interactive cubes example that uses raycaster and projector... p  pa hrefhttpwww.gioblu.comGiOwebsolarsystemindexbackup relnofollowhttpwww.gioblu.comGiOwebsolarsystemindexbackupap  pAs you can see you can navigate in space and change camera position with right and left mouse button.

Negative 852 pIve have a local version of Stash running and all the local developers have access to it.  I am having a little difficulty wrapping my mind how to use it to work with a clients project.p  pI need to be able to clone my clients git repo push it into Stash as a reference repo.  All dev work from all my local devs will be done against that reference repo.  I want to make all the commits against that reference repo, and once all the changes have passed QA, only then push the final code back to the client.  For all intents and purposes, the client will not be getting all the daytoday commits, only the final product.p  pWhat I am looking to do, and do not know if it is feasible, is to clone the clients repo locally, and make that a new origin for all the local developers.  Once all the work is complete, I only want to push the final commit up to the client not all the intermediate commits.  To make things a little more complex, instead of using my local cloned repo as the origin for the developers, I want to push my cloned repo into my local Stash server and have that be the origin.p  pMoving the clients repo into Stash is easy I can just log in, clone the repo, and push it into Stash.  What I do not know how to do is how to keep it synced with the client.  ie if the client makes changes, I want to pull those changes in.  Does it always have to remain a twopart process ie pull changes, rebase, and push  Do I have to do this in two different work paths ie one for my actual dev work, and one to do the pullrebasepush  Is there any automated way of doing something like thisp

Negative 852 pI am building a a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsapirailsapi relnofollowJSONonly applicationa, it is basically a leaner Rails, with fewer middleware and fewer modules. This is an application being built in Rails 4.p  pI want toe to develop a simple app that can administrate the data in the database for the mainapp. For this I would like to use a hrefhttpactiveadmin.info relnofollowActive Admina or a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferikrailsadmin relnofollowRails Admina. But both options somehow use the underlying models and their validations, requirements and such to build on top of. p  pThis means that I need to share at least the models between the main application and the RailsAdmin application.p  pHow would I best do this Is there a good guide on how to build an administrationapplication in a separate rails app next to your main one, instead of having it integratedp  pAs a sidenote another good reason to keep the admin in a separate application from the main app, but on a shared database, is the myriad of dependencies, a gem like ActiveAdmin comes with.p  pAlso note that I am not simply interested in running admin on a different domain or different server, but mostly to keep main app lean and focused. And to keep the dependencies with which something like ActiveAdmin comes, out of my main app.p  hr  pfootnotesp  ul liActiveAdmin, nor RailsAdmin are a problem for performance in themselves. Its that they require all Middleware, whereas a JSONonly Railapp, needs only very few modules, helpers and Middelwares RailsAPI, offers such a slim stack. Performance is not about Admin vs. no admin, but FullRails vs RailsAPI.li liPerformance is not my main problem, the dependencies and bloat is I now have a Rails applicatio that is so slim, focused and lean, that it can measure itself with most Sinatra apps . With only three additional gems each with a few dependencies of their own and a very thin stack of Middelware, I can upgrade, manage and debug very easily.li ul  pMore practical I emdontem have Devise Its a JSONAPI, so tokenauthenticated, emdontem have any views or templateengine. No Formtastic, No Paperclip, Rmagic, Kminari pagers and so on and so forth. All of which will be added to my app when I pull in just an admin. p

Additionally, a member function will update the particles position using velocity data.p  pIm also trying to write a function that will detect a collision between particles and the boundaries of the box.

Negative 852 pI have seen MANY questions on this before online in many places, however, out of about 30 forums and whatnot, NONE of them have had the solution I need, and that includes stackoverflow. If anyone could help me find a reliable solution, it would be greatly appreciated, so thanks in advancep  pIm going to explain my site and situation with as much detail as possible  in order to help any who want to help answer my questions. Here is my situationp  pI have a website and I use PHP and MySQL. My website is a private organization site. In order to allow people access to the site, I send new members of our organization and invite code. The user then visits the website, and the index.php file simply contains a form for logging in as well as a link to the registration pages. New members click the Register Here link to begin registration. The first registration page asks for the users last name and invite code which are checked against a database to make sure that person is on the list and has not yet registered. If they pass the check, they are taken to the next page in which they enter required information username amp password, email address, etc. as well as some optional information phone, bio, etc.. If the user creates a valid username and password and has all required fields filled out, their information is stored in a database. Passwords are all salted and hashed properly and securely, so there is no problem there, and the whole registration process works as it should. After registering, the user is taken back to index.php where they can now log into using the username and password they just created. This works as well when the user logs in, their username and password are checked against the database, and if successful, the user is logged in. When the user is logged in, an ONLINE value in the database is set from False to True. The user is now logged in and can use the site as it is intended. On my site, there is a column that lists users that are currently online based on the ONLINE value from the database. When the user clicks the Log Out button which is located on every page of the site, the logout.php script is run, ending the session and setting the ONLINE value back to False. This all works fine and dandy, however, the problem comes when the user closes the browser without logging out first. This is where I have seen many different solutions various places on the internet. I am going to explain why they wont work and why I need a better solution.p  pThe answers I see most often involve some sort of session timeout or destroying sessions, which is irrelevant because of the fact that the session already does, in fact, end when the user closes the browser, but that has no effect on telling other users whether or not that person is currently online. When the session ends, the database wont be updated, which causes a problem due to the fact that a user can only be logged in from a single instance. If a user attempts to log in while their ONLINE value is already set to TRUE, they arent allowed to log in.p  pI have also seen suggestions of using a Last Seen value instead of an online value, and if a user hasnt had any activity within the past x amount of minutes, log the user out. This wont work, however, for two reasons. 1 That script still has to be running somewhere in order for that to work, meaning another user must be logged in for that to work. That basically means that, if using this method, if a user closes their browser or if they loose connection, they wont be able to log back in until another user logs in. With my organization being a small, locally based organization as it is, there are likely to be many times in which there are no users online. Also, even if another user is logged in, the user whose connection was lost still wont be able to log back in until after x amount of minutes has passed, so if the user accidentally closed their browser and wanted to log back in immediately, they simply wouldnt be able to.p  pA less frequent solution I came across involved using the onBeforeUnload JavaScript function, but those most definitely will not work due to the fact that those would trigger any time a user clicked on a link or on the Back and Forward buttons. Also, if the user has JavaScript disabled in their browser, this will not work at all.p  pThe last thing I have seen involves while loops and the connectionaborted function, and this is the only one that seems like it could work, yet I have not seen a very clear description of how this should work, and after spending months experimenting with it, I still have not come up with a reliable solution.p  pIn many forums, I have seen people say that its not possible, but that cant be the case considering there are sites that do it somehow. I have tested and experimented with this on several sites. On a site that has users such as Facebook or any forum website, there is a list of online users, and in the case that a user closed their browser, their name would no longer appear on the list, so it is possible, even if it can only be achieved through some obscure method. So, if anyone knows of a solution, I would greatly appreciate if you could share some of your wisdom on this subjectp

Negative 852 pI have a Joomla website where I have a custom module with modmyModuleName.php and modmyModuleName.xml files and a folder where there are several PHP scripts that add special functionality to my module. There is a config.php file in the folder that holds an associative array with variables and their values hardcoded. The module works just fine.p  pWhat I want though is to provide administrator area for the values of the variables in the array, so that I can put values in administrator panel and get their values in config.php. In my modmyModuleName.php I use codeltphp echo paramsgtgetparamgtcode and it works like a charm.p  pBut when I try to use the same technique in the config.php it breaks my code. I tried to get the values in modmyModuleName.php and then include it in config.php and use the variables but it does not work either. I have not got so much experience in php and cannot understand what can be the reason. p  pIt sometimes gives me an error of something non object and I guess it must be something connected with object oriented php, am I right And if so is there a way to overcome this without object orientation or how can I solve my problem  p

The list is from a multiple select list on a htmlpage.      var schoolClass  dbContext.SchoolClasses.Firstx gt x.Id.Equalsid     var countriesSelected  dbContext.Countries.Wherex gt countryIds.Containsx.Id       How can i now make sure that only the countries that were selected in the list is added to the school class countries list       It might be that when i did an update, 1 or more countries have been deleted or added.       I need to make sure that if its not selected but was in the database before then it should be removed. Likewise that new selections should be added.       One way would be to just delete all country entries, save the entity and then readd all entries that are selected. Are there other ways that this, easily, can be resolved with using LINQ to SQL      Is this the preferred way or is there a better way  codepre

Negative 852 pNote this question has been edited now that I have narrowed down the root of the problem.p  pNew information I found out that either jquery or more specifically jquery mobile are causing the problem. Somehow my submit form is being messed with so the file is not being sent.p  pBy using Firebug I saw some jquery mobile warnings related to the form and realized that that could be the problem. The thing is that the simple upload page I made for testing the one shown in the old question below has no jquery mobile references, but for some reason some styles get passed from the page I use to access that test page. Once I access the page directly without going through a jquerymobile page, and I see no styles are being applied, the test app works fine.p  pI am really new to this so I dont really know how to check if the file was sent at all, which I think is the problem. I have been messing with Firebug and when looking at the XHR data I see all form text fields are being sent but I see no reference to the file parameter but maybe that is sent separately due to the size, I cannot tell because I dont really know the inner workings of XHR.p  pI have tried disabling html data validation adding novalidate to the form element. Also I tried setting dataenhancefalse and dataajaxfalse to a div wrapping the form element I didnt forget to add this codep  precodeltscriptgt document.onmobileinit, function   .mobile.ignoreContentEnabled  true  ltscriptgt codepre  pso those settings would work. Im still out of ideas. Any help would be really appreciated.p  pOld question might be useful to understand the whole issuep  pIve been investigating this issue all day and Ive run out of ideas. Ive made a somewhat complicated action to handle a form and everything works fine except the file that should be uploaded with the rest of the form data.  file, fileContentType and fileFileName dont get populated, they are null when trying to access them inside the action.p  pIn an attempt to narrow the problem I made a very simple file upload action but it still fails in the same way.

Negative 852 pI have a keyboard controlled character in a game which has a stationary frame when nobr keys are pressed and four different animations for the up, down, left, right directionsbr No diagonal movement.p  pSo when left key is pressed, character moves left across the screen and the left animation is played.

Negative 852 pMy program is password protected. The current password is generated on opening of the program. During generation it is multiplied by the current year. Therefore when I give the program to somebody along with the password that my program sets for them Which only I know since I know how it is generated the password changes at the end of that year. This allows me to charge a licensing fee at year end.p  pMy problem is based on the fact that if I sell my program during say September of one year then their password as coded at the moment will only last till the end of that year. I cannot logically charge a licensing fee only three months after initial set up.p  pMy question is this, is there any way in which I could generate a password, using Delphi 7, that would expire exactly one year from initial set up p

Negative 852 pI have been looking for a solution to my problem for the past 48 hours and I couldnt find anything. Keep in mind I have very basic programming knowledge and I might have overlooked something to fit my needs without understanding the code behind it.p  pI have an excel workbook with a sheet containing all of the data. Its a list of shipments going in and out of a port. Now when something is loaded, a Date Loaded cell is populated with the date automatically. What I need for every row that has a blank Date Loaded cell to be copied to a new workbook which will be named by the date it was generated i.e.031814PM depending on the time of the day, PM could be AM.p  pNow I might not need all the columns to be copied to the new workbook. I need a way to exclude those columns during the copying process.p  pI want the VBA script to be called with a button that will be at the top of the data worksheet so that when we click on it, the new workbook is generated.p

Negative 852 pI have a drop down box and a radio button that are part of a detail row.  There can be multiple detail rows, so there can be multiple instances of this radio button and drop down list.  I have an observablearray that is a master list of loans of types dl and sb.  The dl and sb are the values on the radio buttons.  When a user selects a radio button, i want to populate the drop down box with a list of the loans that have the loan type selected dl or sb from the radio button.  So, for example, if a user selects the radio button that has the value of sb, then I want to populate the drop down list on the selected detail row with only those loans that are sb loan types in the observable, a field called DocStandBy is tied to the loan type, and LoanNum in the same observable is the loan number to be displayed in the drop down box.  p  pI have not been able to figure out how to return a filtered subset of an observablearray to a drop down box based on a click event on a radio button.

I do not want to rely on a library, because that was not the task given to me.p  pI know this question may seem a bit vague and there are similar questions, but Im looking for the method, not for a package and so far I couldnt find any comments regarding the method. The reason this question being vague is that I really have no point to start. What I want to do is actually described here on wikipediap  pemMatrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixelbypixel basis it is also known as pattern matching or pattern recognition.[9] This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale. This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered. This is the technique the early physical photocellbased OCR implemented, rather directly.em a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpticalcharacterrecognitionCharacterrecognition relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpticalcharacterrecognitionCharacterrecognitionap  pIf anyone could help me out on this one, I would appreciate it very much.p  pThanks in advance,p  pJefp

Negative 852 pIm using Googles inapp billing V3 to get orders processed in my Android app. Ive been testing the system by uploading my APK to beta and listing my email as a test account so that I could go back and forth without being charged anything. These orders all remained in Google Wallet as pending i.e., yellow circle. Then, about 1 month after I charged myself, the orders began being automatically canceled by Google. I figured this was because they were all tests.p  pRecently, I upgraded the APK to published status and got my first real order. Strangely enough, its still pending no green circle here. This got me to thinking that maybe all the other previous pending orders were actually mistakes. Can anyone confirm this How do I find out what I did wrong Or, am I just being a little too rushed and real orders take a long time to processp  pThe way my system is set up is that as the user pays, I send them the product via email. Does this, in some way, make the transaction not go through I guess I dont really understand how it all works in the background. Any clarification here would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 852 pI have a jersey webservice running 1.17 and supports returning responses via both XML and JSON via the Produces annotation. I am assuming it uses JAXB by default when returning JSON responses but I have no way to confirm it. As of now, my existing clients also use the same JAXB serializerdeserializer. I want to create a new client that uses Jackson without impacting the existing clients. p  pThe JAXB JSON response is incompatible for Jackson for Maps. the JSON for a map using JAXB is  of the formp  precodemapNameentry[keykey1,valuevalue1,keykey2,valuevalue2] codepre  pand Jackson fails to parse this. Is there any way to make jackson parse this JSONp  pAnother Attempt Switching Jersey to use Jacksonp  pThis isnt the preferred option but I tried setting com.sun.jersey.api.json.POJOMappingFeature to true to allow it to use Jackson for JSON SerializationDeserialization however the service ends up returning 500s on response without logging any exceptions. the log4j logger level is set to TRACE. I enabled the ContainerRepsonseFilter to confirm 500s in the response and to my surprise, it logs the successful 2xx response. My guess is the problem occurs somewhere further down the stack but I dont know where.p

Im saying all this background info, because it may better explain the problem.. this was the solution.. p  pLets say I had 3 jar files in my libs..p  p1  Flurry analyticsbr 2  Revmob adsbr 3  Heyzap social network for gamesp  pThose 3 jars were also in my Android Private Librariesp  pThe library, googleplayservices was added into the Android Private Libraries along with the 3 other JARs. The reference library googleplayservices was added to BaseGameUtils as instructed so that created to copies of the same library in the same build.. so I had to add the 3 jars externally to the build path and ignore the 3 in the Android Private Libraries.p  pNow the question I actually have is,  p  pIm getting an error on this line 28 that says ..p  precode    super.onCreatesavedInstanceState codepre  pSomeone once asked me to post the Logcat, but Im telling you it says the error says the line p  precode    super.onCreatesavedInstanceState codepre  pis causing an error..p  pNow check this out..

Im thinking of embedding code inside crucial functions that arent removed by obfuscating likep  ul liHashed strings like codemd5Property of [COMPANY]codeli liWebrequests sent to minified URLs pointing to our servers if incorrect extension ID or similar is detectedli ul  pBasically stuff thats not easily recognizable as watermarks and has low effect on performance after obfuscating.p  pWhats your experiences Anything you can recommend or got a great idea just waiting to be usedp  pstrongUpdate  summary of suggested methodsstrongp  pNo matter the method its important to note that Javascript can emneverem be protected from code theft due to how its presented to the client.p  pGeneral methods that strongcan and shouldstrong be applied before considering more exotic solutionsp  ul liMove sensitive code to serverside if possible.li liUse a compilerobfuscator. Possible compilers include Google Closure Compiler in Advanced mode or YUI Compressor. Compilers that only minify are not adequate for this task.li liCompile multiple source file sinto a single obfuscated output file.li ul  pOther methods generally focused on making the code more obscure or adding traces that only you can identify in stolen code.

Take special care to avoid compilers removing the code. For example codeif window[OBSCURE UNUSED PROPERTY NAME]  true  Unique trace  code.li liAdd extra forwhile loops in sensitive code that dont really do anything except add your trace and thus dont have any noticable performance impact.li ul  pDont try to add alerts that will tell end users that the code theyre running is pirated  this will only make it easier for pirates to locate and remove your code.p

Negative 852 pOften in Matlab we would plot a figure with many subplot axes, but they are all tiny.p  pIn the prevalent UX paradigm, you would expect to be able to doubleclick such a small plot to have a closer look using the entire screen space.p  pTypically this is the reason I avoid using codesubplotcode, but plot many individual figures instead  so I can move them around on the screen and doubleclick on their titlebars which on Windows maximises the figure to full screen. Doubleclick again, and it returns to its normal size.p  pHowever, the advantage of codesubplotcode is that the set of plots is grouped in one panel. When Im plotting many such groups each with a dozen separate subplot axes, having that many individual figures becomes hard to work with.p  pSo, is there a way to enable this functionality in Matlab alreadyp

Negative 852 pMy goal is to write a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVirtualStudioTechnology relnofollowstrongVSTstronga plugin that should work in emAuditionem and emAudacityem, so Im planning to go with VST v2.x. Im new to VST development, but I have studied the examples a hrefhttpwww.gersic.comvstsdkhtmlplug2.0examples.html relnofollowstrongherestronga. And so far most stuff looks pretty straight forward. The main magic seems to happen in the strongprocessstrong or strongprocessReplacestrong function. Not quite sure what is the benefitdrawback of these two functions though.p  pNow the problem is that my filter is going to need a Lookahead buffer of a few seconds maybe longer, depends on setup. This means that, at the beginning of the process, I will need to fill my eminternalem buffer. And, at the end of the process, I will need to flush the pending samples from the eminternalem buffer.p  pI have been coding filters for a hrefhttpsox.sourceforge.net relnofollowstrongSoXstronga Sound eXchange before and their API is pretty similar to VST at a first glance. What is called strongprocessstrong in VST, is called strongflowstrong in SoX API. But theres one major difference The strongflowstrong function in SoX API gets, as parameters, the number of samples available in the eminputem buffer as well as the number of samples that fit into the emoutputem buffer. The strongflowstrong function then returns the number of samples it has taken from the eminputem buffer as well as the number of samples it has written into the emoutputem buffer. It means I dont have to process all available input samples in every call. And a single call can return fewer samples than it has consumed. Consequently, at the beginning of the process, I can consume all eminputem samples but return strongnostrong emoutputem samples at all This way I can fill my lookahead buffer at the beginning. Finally, SoX API has a strongdrainstrong function that will be called by the Main application at the end of the process in order to flush the pending samples from the filters eminternalem buffer.p  pFrom what I understand about VST, the strongprocessstrong function only has a single parameter to indicate the number of eminputem and emoutputem samples. And it has no way to limit the number of output samples. Apparently, strongprocessstrong assumes a simple N samples in, N samples out behavior. Is that right p  pIf so, what is the recommended way to fill my eminternalem lookahead buffer in VST And what is the recommended way to flush  my eminternalem buffer at the end in VSTp  hr  pBTW I know that I could, of course, fill my internal buffer by returning only silence in the first several strongprocessstrong calls, at the beginning of the process. But that would delayshift the entire audio file, which is strongnotstrong wanted Also it does strongnotstrong solve the problem how to flush the internal buffer at the end of the process.p  pThank you for any advices p

Negative 852 pI wish to keep certain JavaScript functions on the server and then send them via JSON as when required. I will then eval these functions and use them accordingly. Now my problem is, If I minify the source file using Clojure or some other Obfuscation library then will the evaled function have any chance to conflict with my Obfuscated JS filep  pFor Reference  p  precodesrc.js lt Has the eval call on an JSON property  response.func  function someAsyncFunc  that does nothing as of now    var zixuy  evalresponse.func Notice the name of the variable, its a result of Obfuscation codepre  pNow, once the function is evaled, are there any chances that there wont be any weird things that might happen within that function IF there are any variables within it that depend on the Parents scope. If Yes, then is there a workaroundsolution for the samep

Negative 852 pSo Im trying to bend my mind around a little problem I have and I hope there are som clever mind around here.p  pI generate seven 7 circles which gets their width and height values from a PHP variable where the max value is 100 and then set these values with inline CSS in pixels.p  pUnfortunatly a 100 pixel circle is way too small on the desktop version or should I say in a Media Query starting at around 1200px. So I multiply the input by 4 by using calc in CSS.p  pOn the other hand a 400px circle is too big for a mobile, so I would only like to multiply the input by 2 there, but then the combination of inline CSS, a PHP variable and media queries is a no go, as far as I know.p  pSo Im looking for a solution where I can change the variable number I multiply the width and height with based on media queries.p  pOne solution that feels like a hack is device detection. With that I can run a ifelse and do this. A another solution I have been thinking about is wether I can create the circles as percentages and not in pixels and then set maxwidth and maxheight to different values in the media queries, but when I tried I got a problem with circles getting ellipse shapes when scaling the browser window. The best solution would be to change the variable it multiplies with based on screen size. Is this a JS job Or could I maybe generate a SVG on the fly.p  pMy problem with the device detection solution at the moment is basicly that if I resize my browser window on a desktop machine it still multiplies by 4 so my positioning of the circles looks like a mess.p  pThis makes up my structure for the circles. There are 7 of them and a container around. The key is the value I multiply by 4. Can that possibly be changed based on media queriesp  precodeltdiv classcircle1 style    width calcltphp echo myvariable gtpx  4     height calcltphp echo myvariable gtpx  4gt ltdivgt codepre

If someone has this problem, may check if heshe is passing the correct name or not.p  pThanksp

Negative 852 pI am writing a wcf service to receive XML data in request which contains some log info. As i am processing a large amount of data i dont want to have all those xml data in memory after receiving at the server side to avoid large memory consumption and possibly a timeout on processing.p  pI dont want to use Streaming as xml size is not more than 2 MB.

Negative 852 pI have made a simple Script reading class in C which allows me to read and parse scripts. Basically theres a FILE class, which then I proceed to open with fopen.p  pIn functions I proceed to call fgetc and ftell to parse the script file as needed, note this aint an interpreter.

USERNAME, PASSWORD, ACCESSLEVEL or DATABASE  I proceed to call this function  This function reads the char array for ,[] these are symbols readSymbol   In a condition I check what tokenvariable I got and proceed to read   it accordingly  e.g for USERNAME I do readString  reads text inside   e.g for ACCESSLEVEL I do readNumber  reads digits until the next char aint a digit  e.g for DATABASE I do readSymbol   readString  127.0.0.1 readSymbol  , readNumber  3306 readSymbol  , readString  db readSymbol  , readString  user readSymbol  , readString  password readSymbol   codepre  pI would like to be able to read a variable declaration like thisp  precodeDATABASELIST  data1,data2,data3 or DATABASELIST  data1 codepre  pI could easily do readSymbol and readString to read for 3 different string definitions inside the variable, however this list is supposed to have custom user data, like 5 different strings, or 8 different strings  depends.p  pAnd I seriously have no idea how can I do this with the parser I wrote. emPlease note that I am basing this in some Pseudo code I took from a scripter for this type of format, I have the pseudo code extracted from IDA, if you would like to see it

Negative 852 pIn the webapp I inherited, there is some jquery code that captures a barcode scan simple 1D barcode like fitness clubs and grocery stores use  no QR codes, nothing exotic, etc. But the way this is implemented requires a modal box to come up with a spinner on it, then you scan, and it works. Our customers dont like this. They want to be able to scan the barcode from any web page in the app, and not have to go to a certain page and have a modal window come up, blocking everything else, before scanning.p  pI have looked at this with interest a hrefhttpsgithub.comjulienmaureljQueryScannerDetection relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjulienmaureljQueryScannerDetectiona I just cant get it to work.

Negative 852 pI have come across this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma9872192225885answera which makes reference to Hypermedia. My question is similar.p  pI am writing a REST API that will be predominantly consumed by mobile devices. For this reason I want to try and keep a handle on efficient network IO.p  pSay for example I have a emBookem object that contains a emTableOfContentsem collection property. In my app I want to display a list of all books to the user. Then when a user selects a book I want to show them the table of contents.p  pNow, when requesting the list of books I am only interested in say, the Title and thumbnail, because nothing else is display in the list view item. I only want to pull down other items as the books are selected. This is because most probably, not all books will be selected. And so on..p  pSome possible solutions to a lazy loading approachp  ul liHave two object types. BookLight and Book. BookLight only has title and thumbnail. Book has everything. This is not lazy loading and seems like a crap approach.li liOne object which the Rest API will return all fields for, unless there is a query in the request which states which fields are required, and not to return any others. Then, when the object is selected and the full object is required a new query is made with the remaining fields. Alternatively, leave the query blank to refresh the entire object.li ul  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 852 pI am using Paypal to sell license keys, which I generate on my server. I would like to be able to show the user this license key immediately after payment.p  pUsing redirect after payment and Payment Data Transfer, I can get the transaction id after redirect. I can verify that the payment was successful, and generate the license on the spot.p  pI will also receive IPN messages and generate a license key if the IPN message is received as well. p  pI will make sure I dont process the same transaction twice. If the IPN message comes in first, then the redirect will just show the already generated license key.p  pI am wondering if generating license keys using the Payment Data Transfer informtion is secure, or if I should only generate their license key when I receive the IPN message.p  pPayment Data Transfer a hrefhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comwebappsdeveloperdocsclassicpaypalpaymentsstandardintegrationguidepaymentdatatransfer relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comwebappsdeveloperdocsclassicpaypalpaymentsstandardintegrationguidepaymentdatatransferap
Negative 852 pBefore I updated Rails, the default Time format the API was returning was codeyyyyMMddTHHmmssZcode. Now it returns codeyyyyMMddTHHmmsssssZcode. I want to change it back due to apps that rely on the old time format. How can I change this PROJECT default format that codeTimeDateTimecodes codetoscode method returnsp  pEditp  pI should probably mention I started using the codeactivemodelserializercode gem. Not sure if that makes a difference. My guess is this change happened after the update from Rails 4.0.x to 4.1.x. Also I want to change this format for the project. This format changed between Rails versions. codeactivemodelserializercode uses codetoscode, so it makes more sense to override how to project sets this. I dont know where that is.p

Negative 852 pIm trying to process onedrive files in clientside javascript, but first I need a way to use XMLHttpRequest to download the file. Onedrive supports cors for a lot of operations, but for downloading the file into javascript there is the following problem  p  pAs mentioned here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn659726.aspx relnofollowonedrive rest api manualap  pI can send a request top  pGET a hrefhttpsapis.live.netv5.0FILEIDcontentaccesstokenACCESSTOKEN relnofollowhttpsapis.live.netv5.0FILEIDcontentaccesstokenACCESSTOKENap  pand it will reply with a location header redirecting the browser to the file. The problem is when I send these requests through XHR, the browser always sends the Origin header with the request. For the first request I described above, onedrive also replies with an AccessControlAllowOrigin header, so the request is allowed in the browser. However, when the browser is redirected to the actual location of the file, that resource does not have the AccessControlAllowOrigin header, so the XHR request is denied by the browserchrome sends an Origin header set to null for the redirect request.  p  pIve also tried getting the location but not redirecting automatically, and then sending another XHR request, this will set the origin header to the domain of my site, but the result is the same.  p  pAs I mentioned in the beginning, I need to process the data in javascript, so Im not asking about how to download onedrive files to hard drive. I need the data to be accessible by javascript in the webpage.p  pI know that I can use server side programming to get the file data for me and then send it to the client, but for my application this is not an optionat least this is not what Im asking for at the moment.p  pIf there is no way to do this, does anyone have an idea why they would implement their api this way To allow javascript to get the location through cors and redirect but not include a cors header for the redirected resource. Why not just deny cors in the first place Is this a bugp

Negative 852 pLooking for some pro advice... We are a bigger corporation of approximately 25,000 employees of relatively large projects wherein 300 employees may have access to BI and the ability to run reports of which are significant amounts of data that in all likelihood, in its raw form, are beyond the default 65,000 row limit Oracle BI is set to.  Therefore most reports need to be tailored such that they fall beneath the row limit.  p  pThis opens up the question  If the row limit were increased to 90,000 or more, would the system be resourcestrained more by running one big query such that users could then use their own tools to pivot or filter information, or is it best to limit the row results perhaps to even 10,000 and run multiple reports and therefore run multiple queries say, 3 or 4 queries to get information from the one big query in the required form.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, thanks.p

Need to find the median between two dates, but still need it to display based on that invoice number. p  pIn an effort to filter data as much as possible. I realized I can also do WHERE STATUS lt REJECTED and it should also help keep a lot of uncessary dates out. Also, I only wanted to filter between a few months so I added the BETWEEN DATETIME in as well. p  pCode so far but not working... this sort of logic seems to work if there was 1 date column, but now were working with two dates so Im not sure            pre WITH           tmp AS              SELECT invoiceno,         invoicestartdate, invoiceenddate, checkdate, statuscode,         castcount OVER PARTITION BY invoiceno as float AS total,         rownumber OVER PARTITION BY invoiceno ORDER BY          invoicestartdate, invoiceenddate, checkdate AS rnp  code    FROM    INVOICEHEADER INNER JOIN    INVOICEHEADERCUSTOM ON INVOICEHEADER.invoiceid       INVOICEHEADERCUSTOM.invoiceid      WHERE statuscode ltgt REJECTED AND      CheckDate BETWEEN CONVERTDATETIME, 20141201 000000, 102      AND CONVERTDATETIME, 20141231 000000, 102       SELECT      FROM tmp     WHERE total  2.0  1 lt rn and rn lt total  2.0  1  codepre

Negative 852 pThe goal here is to make a pendent made of two layers, a back plate, and a smaller design on top. I wish to have a .stl or other 3d file types for each layer allowing for the users to be able to switch out the designs and back plates until finding a combination of there choosing.p  pSo basically these two 3d images would be combined in the browser.p  pCurrently I am just using canvas to display .stl files. My first thought was to just make a second canvas with a transparent background. However even before trying I do not feel like this will allow the image to still be rotated. If I am wrong let me know It would make this all a lot easierp  pI am not a very experienced programmer. Most of the time I am just able to find applets to do the jobs I need done. This is more advanced than I am use to. Any advice would be helpfulp

Negative 852 pIm very very new to the world of VoIP, so please forgive my terminological inaccuracies.p  pI have just installed  on to a remote server  the OpenSIPS software.p  pI have provisioned a Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk which has its Origination SIP URI set to the IP address of the OpenSIPS server  but it prepended with the protocol sip p  pI have two iPhones with some VoIP apps, that allow me to specify Auth Name, Auth Password, Username, Display Name, Domain and SIP Proxy.p  pIn OpenSIPS i have created a domain  with the IP of my server  also, i created two users  on that domain  and gave them Aliases of 100 and 101.p  pThe software on the iPhones claims that it has registered with the OpenSIPS server, so I have to accept that.p  pI believe that my configuration of the Twilio SIP Trunk is correct, on the basis that there arent many settings to set, and they all look correct, and make some kind of logical sense.p  pWhat i cant figure out from here, and not for lack of searching the web, watching hours of webinars etc, is how do I get OpenSIPS to send outbound calls through to the Twilio Trunk, and also get the handsets to ring on incomming calls, and Twilios SIP Trunk has a Termination SIP URI of xxxxxx.pstn.twilio.com which is  im guessing  supposed to be entered somewhere in to OpenSIPS but I cannot see how to configure this.p  pIm looking for something that is a guide on how to connect OpenSIPS to the Twilio Elastic Sip Trunking service.p  pAny help appreciated...p

Negative 852 pConsider the following micro services for an online store projectbr Users Service keeps account data about the stores users including first name, last name, email address, etcp  pPurchase Service keeps track of details about users purchases.p  pEach service provides a UI for viewing and managing its relevant entities. The Purchase Service index page lists purchases. Each purchase item should have the following fieldsbr id, full name of purchasing user, purchased item title and price.br Furthermore, as part of the index page, Id like to have a search box to let the store manager search purchases by purchasing user name.p  pIt is not clear to me how to get back data which the Purchase Service does not hold  for example a users full name. The problem gets worse when trying to do more complicated things like search purchases by purchasing user name.p  pI figured that I can obviously solve this by syncing users between the two services by broadcasting some sort of event on user creation and saving only the relevant user properties on the Purchase Service end. Thats far from ideal in my perspective. How do you deal with this when you have millions of users would you create millions of records in each service which consumes users datap  pAnother obvious option is exposing an API at the Users Service end which brings back user details based on given ids. That means that every page load in the Purchase Service, Ill have to make a call to the Users Service in order to get the right user names. Not ideal, but I can live with it.p  pWhat about implementing a purchase search based on user name Well I can always expose another API endpoint at the Users Service end which receives the query term, perform a text search over user names in the Users Service, and then return all user details which match the criteria. At the Purchase Service, map the relevant ids back to the right names and show them in the page. This approach is not ideal either.p  pAm I missing something Is there another approach for implementing the above Maybe the fact that Im facing this issue is sort of a code smell would love to hear other solutions.p
Negative 852 pI am working in Rails API with version 4.2 and i got stuck in enum mapping for related entries. My Models are followingp  precodeclass Student lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany enrollments   validates LastName, presence true  end  class Enrollment lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto student     enum Grade [A, B, C, D, F] end codepre  pIn my action when i just retrieve enrollment list i can get the Grade field as enum values. But when use join query with select method to return values i got the databases integer values only. My retrieving logic is like belowp  precodestudents  Student.joinsenrollments.selectstudents., enrollments..paginatepage gt params[page] codepre  pMy json like belowp  precode students [2] 0   id 1 LastName Alexander FirstMidName Carson Grade 0  1   id 2 LastName Alexander FirstMidName Carson Grade 2    codepre  pI need to return first Grade is A and the second one is C. Please help to achieve this..p  pThe following is my rabl filep  precodecollection students attributes id, LastName, Grade  nodetotal m students.totalentries  nodetotalpages m students.totalentries.tof  students.perpage.ceil  codepre
Negative 852 pI have my model classes set up with the integer properties just as they are stored in the database.  So a sample model might look likep  precodepublic class TaskModel      public int TaskId  get set      public int TaskStatus  get set   codepre  pBut on my actual business classes I want to use enums, so the matching business class would look likep  precodepublic class Task      public int TaskId  get set      public Status TaskStatus  get set   codepre  pI then want to use Automappers LINQ projection features to query these business classes, likep  precode return db.Tasks.Where t gt t.TaskStatus  1 .Project.ToltTaskgt codepre  pBut when I do this I get this errorp  blockquote   pUnable to create a map expression from System.Int32 to MyNamespace.TaskStatusp blockquote  pIve been able to resolve it by setting up the mapping as suchp  precodeMapper.CreateMapltTaskModel, Taskgt    .ForMembert gt t.TaskStatus, opt gt opt.MapFromm gt TaskStatusm.TaskStatus    .ReverseMap codepre  pThis seems to work so far, but my question is there a better or DRYer way to do this.  The problem is I will need to do this for a ton of properties across a ton of models and classes.  Seems like there should be a simpler way to do what is essentially a simple cast with having to write 100s of lines of mapping code.p

Negative 852 pI am uploading new build on iTunes Connect via Xcode. Ive selected all my settings automatically I mean about provisioning profiles and certificates, so the bundle id is also appropriate.p  pAfter I clicked submit to app store button, the Xcode build loader displayed for me all entitlements setting, and displayed that it uses app store distribution certificate which is correct, because I use automatic settings for signing.p  pAfter some time, the Xcode build loader said that everything is successes and the build on the iTunes, but I dont see it in my prerelease tab, I can say it will be better if loader said suckesses instead of successes. So it appeared for me many times when I uploaded new build with new build number but there are no new builds on iTunes.p  pAlso I tried to upload build number 4, because I already have 3 builds under prerelease section, but without success. So I bump build to 10 and voila its on the iTunes.p

Negative 852 pI am new to iOS and SpriteKit development, and I want to make a small game with a scrolling background in landscape mode only. So far I have gotten my background to scroll, but my problem is that I dont know to make the background image fit the viewscene correctly.p  pI have a 2040x768 background image, but I can change it to any size I just had no idea which size to go with to make it fit. Its in codeImages.xcassetscode as 1x. I have added it to my view as follows.p  precodeclass GameScene SKScene      override func didMoveToViewview SKView          let backgroundTexture  SKTextureimageNamed Background         let background  SKSpriteNodetexture backgroundTexture         background.position  CGPointx CGRectGetMidXself.frame, y CGRectGetMidYself.frame         self.addChildbackground       codepre  pThe result is that the background image fills the screen, but that the bottom and top of the image is cut off  or rather outside of the screen. The background image has grass at the bottom, but this is not visible. The scenes codescaleModecode is set to codeAspectFillcode. If I set it to codeAspectFitcode, the full height of the image is visible, but then the width of the scene is reduced in case I am using the wrong terminology here, a black space is visible both to the left and right of the background image.p  pAlso, in my code, I have added a 1px high rectangle without any sprite to be the ground. I added an object with physics which is supposed to drop to the ground. The problem is that the ground rectangle is added below the screen. The object stops fine when it hits the ground this is just not visible. I have tested this with with multiple falling objects, and they stack on top of each other, and after adding a couple, they become visible, which means that the ground is indeed there its just not on the screen. So the ground is at the bottom of the background image, which is off the screen. I thought this information might help explain the situation. Here is how I add the ground node.p  precodevar ground  SKNode ground.position  CGPointMake0, 0 ground.physicsBody  SKPhysicsBodyrectangleOfSize CGSizeMakeself.frame.size.width, 1 ground.physicsBody.dynamic  false self.addChildground codepre  pHow do I make the full background image visible and have it adapt to the screen size of the device I tried to add codebackground.size  self.frame.sizecode, which makes everything smaller, but the result is essentially the same. Do I have to make multiple copies of the background in different sizes If so, which sizes, and how do I choose which one is displayed I would prefer a dynamic solution, but I just want this to work.p  pSo basically I just need my entire background image to fit the screen. As long as it fits vertically, then it is okay if it is not wide enough as long as the size of the scene remains the same by keeping the aspect ratio, because it is a scrolling background, so I can add another one next to it horizontally.p  pThere might be resources out there explaining this, but I have really searched for days and have not found the solution. Please provide as much information and details as you can. Thank you very much in advancep

Unfortunately, in my realworld code, I need it to be invariant for other reasons, so I cant use this workaround.  Ive also tried using ClassTags and TypeTags to remember the child class thinking this were a reflectionrelated problem, but I didnt have any luck and I suspect that thats not the intended use case for these, anyway, though perhaps Im mistaken.p  pAny suggestions  Id love to have a flexible collection of unknown number so, no codeTuplescode of child objects extending the same trait but with different types as per user input gathered at run time, and Im happy to accept the tradeoff of doing bookkeeping to ensure I dont miscast or miscodeasInstanceOfcode an object back to the incorrect type, but I cant seem to get it working.

Could they be wrapped together to play the sequence in one go rather than targeting each codeanimatecode tag separately p  pHow could this be solvedp  pHeres a gif of the animated sequence already in the SVG a hrefhttpmedia.giphy.commedia3oEduVQoUyWOj2PR6ggiphy.gif relnofollowhttpmedia.giphy.commedia3oEduVQoUyWOj2PR6ggiphy.gifap  pHeres a demo I set up on Codepen a hrefhttpcodepen.ioselcukcurapenBNOxQX relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioselcukcurapenBNOxQXap  pThanks in advancep  pstrongJavaScriptstrongp  precode.block.on click, functionelem      console.logclicked  svg  document.getElementByIdtest svg.beginElement  svg2  document.getElementByIdtest2 svg2.beginElement  svg3  document.getElementByIdtest3 svg3.beginElement    svg.beginElement  codepre  pstrongHTMLSVGstrongp  precodeltdiv idblock classblockgtclick this to play svg animationltdivgt  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltsvg idScene1l1 imagerenderingauto baseProfilebasic version1.1 preserveAspectRatioxMidYMid meet x0px y0px width36 height36 overflowvisible xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg viewBox0 0 36 36 xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlinkgt   ltg maskurlScene1l120gt     ltggt       ltuse xlinkhreficon transformmatrix1 0 0 1.00841 18 18gt         ltanimateTransform attributeNametransform additivereplace typetranslate beginindefinite dur0.9s keyTimes00.259260.592591 values61,1861,1818,1818,18 keySplines.25 .5 .5 1.25 .5 .5 1.1 .1 .9 .9 calcModesplinegt         ltanimateTransform attributeNametransform additivesum typescale beginindefinite dur0.9s keyTimes01 values1,1.008411,1.00841 keySplines.25 .5 .5 1 calcModesplinegt       ltusegt       ltanimate idtest attributeNamedisplay beginindefinite repeatCount1 dur0.9s keyTimes00.259261 valuesnoneinlinenonegt     ltggt   ltggt   ltmask idScene1l120gt     ltggt       ltpath fillFFF dM36,36L0,0 0,36 36,36 fillopacity1gt     ltggt   ltmaskgt   ltg maskurlScene1l100gt     ltggt       ltuse xlinkhreficon transformmatrix1 0 0 1.00841 18 18gt         ltanimateTransform attributeNametransform additivereplace typetranslate beginindefinite dur0.9s keyTimes00.259260.592591 values25,18.4525,18.4518,1818,18 keySplines.25 .5 .5 1.25 .5 .5 1.1 .1 .9 .9 calcModesplinegt         ltanimateTransform attributeNametransform additivesum typescale beginindefinite dur0.9s keyTimes00.259260.592591 values1,11,11,1.008411,1.00841 keySplines.25 .5 .5 1.25 .5 .5 1.1 .1 .9 .9 calcModesplinegt       ltusegt       ltanimate idtest2 attributeNamedisplay beginindefinite repeatCount1 dur0.9s keyTimes00.259261 valuesnoneinlinenonegt     ltggt   ltggt   ltmask idScene1l100 styledisplaynonegt     ltggt       ltpath fillFFF dM0,0L36,36 36,0 0,0 fillopacity1gt     ltggt     ltanimate idtest3 attributeNamedisplay beginindefinite repeatCount1 dur0.9s keyTimes00.629631 valuesinlinenonenonegt   ltmaskgt   ltdefsgt     ltsymbol idicon overflowvisiblegt       ltggt         ltggt           ltpath fillFFF dM16.5,16.35Q15.05,17.85 13.05,17.85L13.05,17.85Q15.15,17.85 16.55,16.35 18,14.95 18,12.9L18,12.9Q18,14.9 16.55,16.35 15.15,17.85 13.05,17.85L13.05,17.85Q15.05,17.85 16.5,16.35 18,14.9 18,12.9L18,12.9Q18,14.95 16.5,16.35 M13.2,13.2Q13.55,12.85 13.55,12.3L13.55,8.2Q13.55,7.65 13.2,7.3 12.75,6.85 12.25,6.85L8.05,6.85Q7.5,6.85 7.05,7.3 6.75,7.65 6.75,8.2L6.75,12.3Q6.75,12.85 7.05,13.2 7.5,13.65 8.05,13.65L12.25,13.65Q12.75,13.65 13.2,13.2 M7.15,0.15Q7.15,1.35 6.55,2.6 6,3.9 5.05,4.95 4.05,5.85 2.75,6.45 1.45,6.95 0,6.95 1.5,6.95 2.85,6.45 4.05,5.85 5.1,4.95 6.05,3.9 6.6,2.6 7.2,1.35 7.2,0.15 7.2,1.6 6.6,2.85 6.05,4.15 5.1,5.2 4.05,6.15 2.85,6.7 1.5,7.3 0,7.3 1.45,7.3 2.75,6.7 4.05,6.15 5.05,5.2 6,4.15 6.55,2.85 7.15,1.6 7.15,0.15 M13.2,3L13.2,12.9Q13.2,12.95 13.15,13.05L13.05,13.05Q13.15,13.05 13.2,13.05 13.25,12.95 13.25,12.9L13.25,3 10.45,3Q10.85,1.65 10.85,0.15 10.85,2 10.05,4.05 9.15,6 7.65,7.4 6.15,8.9 4.25,9.75 2.25,10.65 0,10.65 2.15,10.65 4.2,9.75 6.15,8.9 7.65,7.4 9.15,6 9.95,4.05 10.8,2 10.8,0.15 10.8,1.6 10.35,3L13.2,3gt         ltggt       ltggt     ltsymbolgt   ltdefsgt ltsvggt codepre

Negative 852 pProbably not official terminology, but I want to implement a convenience accessor of sorts. I have a class that has a class func codecurrentUsercode that returns something like a codesharedInstancecode. Like common usages of codesharedInstancecode objects in Swift, whenever we try to access the singleton, we have to do codeNSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaultscode. However, it can be quite tedious to use. For example, if one had to setget codeNSUserDefaultscode hundreds of times, hed have to write a long line codeNSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.setObjecthi, forKey greetingcode.p  pI want to somehow do codeNSUserDefaults.setObjecthi, forKey greetingcode  leaving out the codestandardUserDefaultscode text, but still retain the intention to use a method on the object returned by codestandardUserDefaultscode, by some form of redirection.p  pHeres my situationp  precodeclass User PFUser      NSManaged var userPointer PublicUser     override class func currentUser gt User  kind of like sharedInstance         return super.currentUser as User          private override init          super.init       codepre  pIdeally, I want to add a variable to the classp  precodevar publicUser PublicUser      get          return User.currentUser.userPointer          set          User.currentUser.userPointer  publicUser       codepre  pbut I feel it doesnt make sense to force someone to instantiate a codeUsercode class just to access this property for convenience.

Negative 852 pI have ws working for sending user login details through a websocket. However I know that someone sniffing packets could capture the password, so I wanted to use wss instead. However I now understand, through playing around with my back end, that firstly a certificate is required for it to connect properly, and secondly, if i cause the self signed certificate warning to sho0w, afterwards the websockets will work with wss, but that is not good enoyugh for clients. From googling this issue, I have found that A self signed certificate will probalby not be good enough.p  pAnd all I want is to provide a user with a safe way to login..... So anyway I am now thinking it would be better to avoid having to use wss all together. I could use a conventional servlet for login but that will probably require a certificate too for https and I dont want to have to start paying people loads of money for certificates when my business might not even be that successful.p  pI have been thinking about other ways I could send the users password securely. One way might be to generate a hash in the browser. I know I could use some king of challenge along with a salt sent to the browser but I am not exactly sure how to do this and how safe this would be. I have the conventional login working with a salt, generating a hash with AES. Any suggestionsp  pI just want the users login details to be safe and I dont want to go down the route of certificates, its annoying and unreliable. p
Negative 852 pSo, I transferred several domains from a separate AWS account to my current one via Route 53, and none of the transferred domains are propagating or pointing at my new accounts instance properly. p  pIt has been 48 hours and nothing has changed. Inside of this time period I have purchased new domains and set up their DNS settings, creating new, working websites, so I doubt its just a matter of waiting out the transferred domains to make sure they propagate.p  pAs an example, emcasasites.ioem started on my original account, and was transferred. It is currently not working and I am unable to ping it.p  pHeres a screencap of the settings. p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comOIT9SYa.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comOIT9SYa.pngap  pYou can see the A record is pointing to my instances elastic IP, and it has been assigned proper Amazon DNS servers. However, I cant even ping this domain name. It returns nothing... the MX record still works for my email, dont ask me how.p  hr  pHeres a screenshot of a domain I bought and set up in the last 24 hours on my current AWS account.

Domains I set up on my own do work. Cant tell why.strongp  pI am obviously not an expert in regards to DNS stuff, so any light shed on the situation would be very helpful and appreciated. p  h1EDIT  Resolvedh1  pAWS assigns the nameservers when you create a hosted zone for the registered domain. Typically this is done when you buy it and the user doesnt have to manually assign anything.p  pSince they were instead transferred, I got two different sets of nameservers and Route53 didnt alert me to this. Still a simple error on my part. Thanks all.p

Negative 852 pFor years weve been manually writing large sql queries to satisfy business user requirements  p  blockquote   pGive me all the customers that live in Vermont, arent corporate   clients different table, exclusionary, dont have product x   different table, exclusionary, have paid us money in the last x   months different tables, inclusion, and drink tea on tuesdays and   thursdays etc.p blockquote  pWe do this work every day, and often times with very similar criteria with slight tweaks, and unfortunately, its both tedious and error prone.  I would really like to offload this work to a generic querysearch interface to the business users who are the ones who need the data. p  pThe trouble is that we have hundreds of tables that fk back to our customers tables in zero to 1 or zero to many relationships, so a single view would be really large and slow, even if were talking about getting the top 50 of all probable criteria.  p  pMy initial thought was to look at different reporting engines, but that hasnt seemed to help. The next thought was to create some kind of denormalized structure, loosely json based, that we could then setup essentially a faceted search on it, but this also seems unworkable. p  pIs there some sort of program that you can configure on top of your database that will do this based on fks and whatnot already Or if not, is there a way to setup something like entitynhibernatewhatever in such a way that it can issue the complex set of joins needed to get what the end user needs so that we can basically setup the mappings and let the interface build the queries based on checkmarks and dropdowns  I would like to be able to easily add a new criteria via configuration rather than updating code.p  hr  pIve been searching for a solution to this for weeks off and on, and cant seem to find a suitable answer, and dont know where else to ask.p
