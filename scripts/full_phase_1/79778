The error message is pointing to a linep  precodeoutput.printrs.getString1 codepre  pIt appears to happen when the query takes a little longer to run, for some reason.

Negative 79778 pI was wondering if any of you had successfully implemented DDD in a ClientServer app and would like to share some experiences.p  pWe are currently working on a smart client in Flex and a backend in Java. On the server we have a service layer exposed to the client that offers CRUD operations amongst some other service methods. I understand that in DDD these services should be repositories and services should be used to handle use cases that do not fit inside a repository. Right now, we mimic these services on the client behind an interface and inject implementations Webservices, RMI, etc via an IoC container.p  pSo some questions arisep  ul lishould the server expose repositories to the client or do we need to have some sort of a facade that is able to handle security for instanceli lishould the client implement repositories and DDD in general knowing that in the client, most of the logic is view related and real business logic lives on the server. All communication with the server happens asynchronously and we have a single threaded programming model on the client.li lihow about mapping client to server objects and vice versa We tried DTOs but reverted back to exposing the state of our objects and mapping directly to them. I know this is considered bad practice, but it saves us an incredible amount of timeli ul  pIn general I think a new generation of applications is coming with the growth of Flex, Silverlight, JavaFX and Im curious how DDD fits into this.p

Negative 79778 pI have created a custom workflow activity that copies attachments from a case to an email, both supplied as Lookup parameters. I installed the workflow assembly, created a case with attachments and an email. I then used the workflow design to create a new workflow with one step that runs my custom activity. The attachments copied nicely.p  pThe first use of the custom workflow assembly is to create the email before doing the copying the attachments. I therefore created a new workflow that created an email using details from a case. I set this up as a manual workflow as this it what the end user CRM consultant will be doing. I ran that workflow and an email was created as expected.p  pI then modified the second workflow to add a second step.

Negative 79778 pGreetings.p  pImagine youve been given a string from somewhere you cant control.  In that string is a decimal number.  You want to add commas ie turn 1234567.89 into 1,234,567.89 to that number while keeping the entire string intact.  The currency symbol before the number will vary, but the commaformatting doesnt have to vary by culture.p  pIs there an easy way to do this in .NETp  pIf theres not an easy way, Ill go into further detail as to what I had planned to do.  We can use string.Substring to get the number out because it is always between some static text.  For examplep  pOur stringp  precodestring s1  Blah Blah Blah. Total price 1234567.89 Blah Blah Blah Blah codepre  pWe can get at the price like thisp  precodeint start  s1.IndexOfTotal price   13 int length  s1.IndexOf  start string trim  s1.Substringstart, length codepre  pGrab the currency character, leave the restp  precodechar curr  trim[0] string sAmount  s1.Substring1, s1.Length codepre  pNow we can format our decimalp  precodedecimal dAmount if decimal.TryParsesAmount, out dAmount     string formattedPrice  curr  dAmount.ToStringN2    Console.WriteLineformattedPrice  codepre  pNow I could just insert the resulting string back into my original string where it should go.  The point of writing this question is that bthis feels very nasty to meb, and I was hoping to find a better way to deal with this.p  pThanks for your time.  I will be refreshing this for the next hour and will choose an answer within that time.p

Negative 79778 pIm working with a complicated xml schema, for which I have created a class structure using xsd.exe with some effort.  I can now reliably deserialize the xml into the generated class structure.  For example, consider the following xml from the web servicep  precodeltODM FileTypeSnapshot CreationDateTime20091009T195846.5967434Z ODMVersion1.3.0 SourceSystemXXX SourceSystemVersion999gt   ltStudy OID2gt     ltGlobalVariablesgt       ltStudyNamegtTest1ltStudyNamegt       ltStudyDescriptiongt       ltProtocolNamegtTest0001ltProtocolNamegt     ltGlobalVariablesgt     ltMetaDataVersion OID1 NameBase Version Descriptiongt     ltMetaDataVersion OID2 NameTest0001 Descriptiongt     ltMetaDataVersion OID3 NameTest0002 Descriptiongt   ltStudygt ltODMgt codepre  pI can deserialize the xml as followsp  precodepublic ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy GetStudystring studyId    ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy study  null   ODM odm  DeserializeltODMgtService.GetStudystudyId   if odm.Study.Length gt 0     study  odm.Study[0]   return study  codepre  pService.GetStudy returns an HTTPResponse stream from the web service.  And Deserialize is a helper method that deserializes the stream into the object type T.  p  pMy question is this is it more efficient to let the deserialization process create the entire class structure and deserialize the xml, or is it more efficient to grab only the xml of interest and deserialize that xml.  For example, I could replace the above code withp  precodepublic ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy GetStudystring studyId    ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy study  null   using XmlReader reader  XmlReader.CreateService.GetStudystudyId        XDocument xdoc  XDocument.Loadreader     XNamespace odmns  xdoc.Root.Name.Namespace     XElement elStudy  xdoc.Root.Elementodmns  Study     study  DeserializeltODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudygtelStudy.ToString    return study  codepre  pI suspect that the first approach is preferred  there is a lot of dom manipulation going on in the second example, and the deserialization process must have optimizations however, what happens when the xml grows dramatically  Lets say the source returns 1 MB of xml and Im really only interested in a very small component of that xml.  Should I let the deserialzation process fill up the containing ODM class with all its arrays and properties of child nodes  Or just go get the child node as in the second examplep  pNot sure this helps, but heres a summary image of the dilemmap  pimg srchttpfarm3.static.flickr.com263140046031535F25989c820f5Fo.png altalt text p

Negative 79778 pWhat are my options for printing in Silverlight 3 Assume I have this awesome Silverlight applicationcontrol that creates a graphical display of some data. Now the user wants to print it.p  pI have considered a few options but I have yet to test any of these. Before I do that I would like to get some feedback on how it can be done.p  ol lipUse the browser printing capabilites. In my experience this is does not provide a useful print, but perhaps with some interaction between the Silverlight host and the browser it can be donepli lipUse a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap28VS.9529.aspx relnofollowcodeWriteableBitmapcodea. The image can either be written locally, but this requires interaction from the user, or sent to the server where a suitable file e.g. PDF file can be generated and then sent back to the browser. Unfortunately you now get the overhead of sending the image twice across the network and increased complexity on the server side.pli lipSend XAML back to the server that is then rendered in a WPF application running on the server. The result is the sent back to the client. Im not sure if this is possible at all however, but if it is the network overhead is less than in option 2. Unfortunately, the complexity on the server side is even higher.pli lipWait for Silverlight 4pli ol  pOne thing I have considered is that my awesome control probably will have a codeScrollViewercode at the highest level, but the user will want to print the entire content of the control, not just whatever is visible inside the bounds of the codeScrollViewercode.

Negative 79778 pPardon the complicated title.  Heres my situation  Im working on a Grails app, and using jQuery for some of the more complex UI stuff.p  pThe way the system is set up, I have an item, which can have various files usersupplied associated with it.  On my Itemshow view, there is a link to add a file.  This link pops up a jQuery modal dialog, which displays my file upload form a remote .gsp.p  pSo, the user selects the file and enters a comment, and when the form is submitted, the dialog gets closed, and the list of files on the Itemshow view is refreshed.  I was initially accomplishing this by addingp  precodeonclickjavascriptwindow.parent.myDialog.dialogclose codepre  pto my submit button.p  pThis worked fine, but when submitting some larger files, I end up with a race condition where the dialog closes and the file list is refreshed before the new file is saved, and so the list of files is out of date the file still gets saved properly.p  pSo my question is, what is the best way to ensure that the dialog is not closed until after the form submit operation completes  Ive tried using the      codeltgformRemotecode tag in Grails, and closing the dialog in the after attribute according to the Grails docs, the script is called after form submission, but I receive an error taken from FireBug stating that p  precodewindow.parent.myDialog.dialog is not a function codepre  pIs this a simple JavaScriptGrails syntax issue that Im missing here, or am I going about this entirely wrongp  pThanks so much for your time and assistancep
Negative 79778 pI need a solution for the age old problem of a default button firing undesirably. i.e you hit enter in a text box, but there is a submit button on the form that isnt the one you want to fire or maybe you dont want the form to fire at all.p  pIm wondering about the following solution. Slightly hacky but should be reliable as far as I can tell.p  pInside the form the FIRST thing is a button which is invisible. Then some jquery to immediately disable it. If you hit enter on the form this button counts as the default button and gets triggered, but does nothing because of the return false event handler.p  pSolutions Ive seen before rely on things like keydown event handlers, or other seemingly complex  hard to test in every browser.p  pMy solution that I havent seen before but is probably not unique seems much simpler and I think pretty reliable.

Negative 79778 pI know that in the architectures Im personally familiar with x86, 6502, etc, the stack typically grows downwards i.e. every item pushed onto the stack results in a decremented SP, not an incremented one. p  pIm wondering about the historical rationale for this. I know that in a unified address space, its convenient to start the stack on the opposite end of the data segment say so theres only a problem if the two sides collide in the middle. But why does the stack traditionally get the top part Especially given how this is the opposite of the conceptual modelp  pAnd note that in the 6502 architecture, the stack also grows downwards, even though it is bounded to a single 256byte page, and this direction choice seems arbitrary.p
Negative 79778 pI am facing a wierd socket connection problem in .net windows application.I am using socket from .net to asynchonously communicate to a legacy intersystems cache database.brbrI have a specific timeout value in the application, when the timeout occurs, user is prompted to stay connected to the application.

If with out navigating in the application and say stay connected second time, and navigate in the app I am getting socket host refused connection error. This I can assume may be socket is terminated.brbr But the wierd part is if I set the application timeout to 10 mins, then also I am getting socket error second time.

Yes, a lot of code could be written in PHP to support ETags and range requests, but it seems like overkill to do all that just to add one header, when Apache has all that functionality built in.p
Negative 79778 pThis is a nicetohave for our designer. She has a layout where a form title, on the top right of the form banner, is two words in English. There are several forms so the words are a little different each time. So the effect is something likep  precode    firstword          form codepre  pThere is a fancy swoopy thing underneath this and some other fields to the left. Of course with several different forms, the words are different lengths, so sometimes the words are on one line, because they fit in the widthp  precode   short form codepre  pShe wants the words to always be on two lines, basically classic flush right. AFAIK this isnt really possible, especially with localization.

Negative 79778 pIm trying to use HTTPLiveStreaming in my app and after weeks of reencoding it seems to work now without errors by the mediastream validator. p  pOn my latest iPod Touch iOS 4.0 with WiFi the videostream loads in 1sec and switches to the highest bandwidth stream. On another test device iPhone 3G iOS 3.0 with WiFi it takes up to 30 seconds to load the stream  although I see in my log files that it looks for the high quality stream after 1 second.

Negative 79778 pstrongSummarystrongbr Does anybody know if there are known issues or configuration gotchas with an IIS service connecting to an Azure based servicep  pstrongScenariostrongbr I currently have a scenario that requires me to host two webservices, one in Azure, and one on a server running IIS. The IIS hosted service a WCF service connects to the Azure hosted service actually the Azure storage API in order to fetch certain information. This information is manipulated and returned to the client.p  pClient  IIS Service  Azure Storage Servicep  pstrongIssuestrongbr Im running into issues with the IIS service connecting to the Azure Service. The hostname cannot be resolved. Im using the Azure Storage client from my code, but have actually tried this using the azure API calls, and they also do not work from IIS. I captured the requests using Fiddler on a different machine, they match the azure REST API calls, as expected. These requests, when made outside of IIS on the host machine execute properly. It is only when they are issued by the IIS service that they fail.p  pIn my research other people have been running into this issue when theres a firewall problem, but since I can hit the service properly from the machine, that doesnt seem to fit the bill.

Negative 79778 h2Some Backgroundh2  pWe have a team of four developers and we have two web application projects in our visual studio solution. We decided to centralize resources between these two applications like images and video, etc. How we did this was we created a directory on another server devfileshareWebFileShareContent. We then add this directory as a virtual directory at the root of both web applications in IIS. Essentially this makes Content point to devfileshareWebFileShareContent.p  h2The Problemh2  pThe problem we had was with the security permissions. What we had to do was create a user on devfileshare called fileshare and give that user read and write permissions to the content directory. Then on every developers computer we had to add that same user fileshare with the same password. After that we had to set each application pool to run under that user instead of the default. Then finally we had to add the virtual directory, setting the Connect As user to fileshare.p  pThis actually works and our projects can write to and read from the virtual directory. My question is, is there an easier way to accomplish this Currently we have to add a new user to every new developer computer we set up, then modify IIS application pools and virtual directories to use this new user. Its a bit of a pain and it seems like there would be an easier way to set up virtual directories to point to another server on the network.p  pThanks in advance Let me know if you have any questions or if I did not make something very clear.p

Negative 79778 pI have been trying for some time to create a classseries of classes that, upon detecting a resize in a related object, attempts to halt the resize of the object and create a smooth resize animation for it. However, I have always had a problem with the objects flickering on the screen for a second at the target size before the animation kicks in.p  pLong story short, after some serious debugging and selfdoubt, I am under the impression that calling codeStoryboard.Begincode does not affect the target value until the emnext clock tickem.  I presume that this has something to do with codeStoryboard.Seekcode not occuring until the next clock tick.  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc19053428vvs.9529.aspxSee the MSDN Referencea.  And as such, the object adopts its new height for a single frame before the animation kicks in which pulls it back to the starting height.p  pI have spent a long time trying to get this working because its not nearly as simple as it seems.  I cant set codeFrameworkElement.Heightcode to the codee.PreviousSize.Heightcode in a codeFrameworkElement.SizeChangedcode event handler, because that affects the true height of the object.  As an example of why this doesnt work, is if something changes the true height of the object while the animation is playing, then resetting codeFrameworkElement.Heightcode to the target height that was collected when the animation began could set it as an incorrect, outdated value.p  pTheres more things Ive tried, and Im sure theyll come up as answers arrive, but any ideas you have will be very much appreciated.p

Negative 79778 pI have worked with various versions of MS SQL Server including 2000,2005,2008,R2,SomeDenali. I have never been so excited about a new feature like the Table Valued parameters in stored proc. I do C development as well and Im digging TVP, I use it to minimize the number of database calls from my front end app. p  pNow my real question is what are the downsides to using Table Valued Parameters. Its almost too good to be true.p  pPlease share your thoughts. Plus I dont want to get too deep into using it and have to change.p

Negative 79778 pIve got tens of domain objects User, Group, Role, Community, Post etc. Also ive got extended objects UserExt, GroupExt etc which are derived from those and contain some addition data. In my data access control layer there are methods for retrieving base objects. When i need to populate child objects with data I use those methods but every time i need to convert that result to the child type.br As I cannot cast parent object as child, i need to provide converters for every parentchild pair via constructors, methods, extensions to existing converters or any other way. That is what i dont like as if i ever add any field to base type i could forget to adjust my converters. Is there more automatized way to populate childs fields from parentbr Thank youp  pPS code  p  pDomain objects  p  precodepublic class Role  OutdoorObject      public String Name  get set      public Int32 CreatedById  get set      public Int32 UpdatedById  get set    public class RoleExt  Role      public IPrincipal CreatedBy  get set      public IPrincipal UpdatedBy  get set   codepre  pData access layerp  precodepublic Role GetByIdInt32 roleId      try                  seek in cache, return if found         LQRole lqRole  context.LQRoles.FirstOrDefaultr gt r.RoleID  roleId         Role result  LQMapper.LQToObjectlqRole          put result to cache         return result          catch Exception ex              if ex is BaseRepositoryException throw ex         else throw new UnknownRepositoryExceptionex.Message       codepre  pService layerp  precode    public Role GetByIdIPrincipal Executer, int roleID              try                       perform operation             Role r  repo.GetByIdroleID               check access             if CanReadExecuter, r throw new OperationIsNotPermittedServiceException              return r                  catch Exception ex                       ...                public RoleExt GetExtByIdIPrincipal Executer, int roleID      try               perform operation         Role r  GetByIdIPrincipal Executer, int roleID         RoleExt result  new RoleExt          here i need to convert r to result          and populate addition fields         result.CreatedBy  userService.GetByIdExecuter, r.CreatedById         result.UpdatedBy  userService.GetByIdExecuter, r.UpdatedById           check access         if CanReadExecuter, result throw new OperationIsNotPermittedServiceException          return result          catch Exception ex              ...       codepre

Negative 79778 pI have a basic MVC setup with helper classes containing utility methods, several of these are likely to be used when loading a view, in both the view itself, the controller and sometimes, but not often, the models. I use autoloading to find the helper files I need, so the class is only ever included once, then, in theory the file shouldnt get searchedincluded again, that way I dont have to put include statements in the script and i believe the file isnt loaded unless the class is used. p  pMy question is whats likely to be the most efficient way to make calls to these helper classes Should I make all methods in a given helper static, or maybe use a singleton pattern for the helpers or should I just create a new instance wherever its used e.g. an instance in the view an instance in the controller... p  pthanks for your inputp

However, if we didnt have codeFooltNgtFooFooltNgtampampcode, codeFooltNgtFooconst FooltNgtampcode would be called instead, which would do a redundant copy operation.p  pMy question is, as noted in the code, with this specific example which is using a staticallyallocated simple array, is there any way to utilize the move constructor to avoid this redundant copyp
Negative 79778 pI have a simple strongclientstrongJavaSE, Swing  strongserverstrongJava EE, EJB, JPA architecture.p  pI would like to create a client side cache for my server side entities. For example, if I download an entity, I will store it in an Embedded Derby DB with client side JPA, so the next time, when its needed, the client can look up first in its own DB and retrieve the entity from there to spare network communication. Simple replicationp  pMy problem starts with the IDs of the entities having the same ID on both client and server side sounds a real bad practice, so I should store some mapping for the client side ID and the server side ID of an entity. The problem continues, because I have so many entites 1520.., and associations amongst them.p  pPlacing the right IDs towards server communication updating, merging or towards client side promotes to have some recursive and maybe reflective code, an engine, which keeps tracking of the mapped IDsp  ul liif I modified a clientside entity, and want to merge to server, before sending to server, it should replace clientside IDs in the entity set in various OneToMany foreign keysli lifrom the server side, the problem is vica versali ul  pDoes anyone know about such a framework, especially for JPA users Or do you have some implementation tips maybe  I would like to solve this issue at the applicationpersistence level, if possiblep  pThanks in advance, Andrs Literp

Negative 79778 pOk here is the deal Im using BeginRouteForm to submit a search.

Negative 79778 pI am new to iOS development. I will try my best to explain my question, please pardon me if you find it silly.p  pI was wondering if one can load a subview in a UINavigationController by clicking a link inside a UIWebView. p  pExplaining it further, lets say there is UINavigationController that has a subview and that subview has a UIWebView called A, and there is another subviewthat is not loaded yet called B. Is is possible to load B or perform any other native Objective C event when user taps on a link inside the UIWebView A p  pFor example in Instagram app for iPhone, as I have observed I may be wrong, there are UIWebViews in views controlled by UINavigationControllers. Taping a link inside a web view loads a new view. How is it happening Can one set up the communication between the web page loaded inside the UIWebView and the parentsuper UIView.p  pPlease correct me if I am lost. I am a n00b in iOS development so far. Also reference me the APIs or tutorials to do this if this makes any sense. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 79778 pIve always enjoyed the following intuitive explanation of a monads power relative to a functor a monad can change shape a functor cannot.p  pFor example codelength  fmap f [1,2,3]code always equals code3code.p  pWith a monad, however, codelength  [1,2,3] gtgt gcode will often not equal code3code. For example, if codegcode is defined asp  precodeg  Num a gt a gt [a] g x  if x2 then [] else [x] codepre  pthen code[1,2,3] gtgt gcode is equal to code[1,3]code.p  pThe thing that troubles me slightly, is the type signature of codegcode. It seems impossible to define a function which changes the shape of the input, with a generic monadic type such asp  precodeh  Monad m, Num a gt a gt m a codepre  pThe MonadPlus or MonadZero type classes have relevant zero elements, to use instead of code[]code, but now we have something more than a monad.p  pAm I correct If so, is there a way to express this subtlety to a newcomer to Haskell.

Negative 79778 pNB I have never used swing before, neither graphics 2D, and I dont program very much...p  pWhat I am trying to do is to make a program which takes an arrayvector as input.

And this should pop up in a panel when I run the code..  The Idea is to show activityno activity as a function of time, so the line would preferably be shown in a chart  xaxis amp yaxis ... And there will be several of these discontinuous lines above each other  for comparison of different cases.p  pI have tried for a while to look at examples using swing and graphics 2D, but as I have very limited amount of time  I could really need some help .. p  pAny code thatp  ul licreates a panel, frame etc  where I easily can see where I can insert my graph that  is a panel which is ready to display the graph I will makeli lidraw a graph of discontinuous horizontal lines based on an array as described aboveli ul  p...is immensely appreciated p  padded from commentp  pSorry  did not finish my answer  I could sure try to learn how to use all the different things in Swing frames, panels etc.. But at the moment my main goal is to finish my assignment for school  which is the visualization of data itself  and they do not really care how you get there, the most important thing is that it visualizes something useful...

Negative 79778 pI need a library which will take in two regular expressions and determine whether they are isomorphic i.e. match exactly the same set of strings or not For example ab is isomorphic to [ab]p  pAs I understand it, a regular expression can be converted to an NFA which in some cases can be efficiently converted to a DFA.  The DFA can then be converted to a minimal DFA, which, if I understand it correctly, is unique and so these minimal DFAs can then be compared for equality.  I realize that not all regular expression NFAs can be efficently transformed into DFAs especially when they were generate from Perl Regexps which are not truly regular in which case ideally the library would just return an error or some other indication that the conversion is not possible.p  pI see tons of articles and academic papers online about doing this and even some programming assignments for classes asking students to do this but I cant seem to find a library which implements this functionality.  I would prefer a Python andor CC library, but a library in any language will do.  Does anyone know if such a library  If not, does someone know of a library that gets close that I can use as a starting point p

Then it may read back other data at the start of the stream, then at another place etc. In short  it needs to have access to any bytes of the data.p  pAn example would be to read data of an archive file without knowing the file format before starting to read from codestdincode I need to check the archive metadata, find archive files names and offsets etc.p  pstrongSo Ill make a local copy of stdin content and work from it.

Negative 79778 pCan someone tell me what the default timeout is when using codeactiveRecordcode storep  pI dont want to set the timeout because I want it to behave as a session cookie. ie expire when the user closes the browser, which doesnt happen if you manually set the expire date.p  pWhen I leave the expire date off, the session will timeout sometime within a couple of hours of no use. Why is this sop  pSo really what Im asking is, is it possible for the session to not timeout at all when the user keeps hisher browser open and only expire when heshe hits logout or closes the browser Keeping in mindp  pthe cookie doesnt get deleted if you specify an expiration on the codeactiveRecordcode codesessionstorecode when user closes browser.p

Negative 79778 pSo, I inherited some code below from someone else and Im trying to understand how it works.  I understand msot of the code though Im pretty new to Access VBA but the one part I dont get is how this code groups all the info for one policy together.p  pThe situation is as follows.  To get premium data for a specific policy, from our company database, we have to get it one coverage per line.  But, I want all premiums, one for each coverage, all on the same line.  So, this code puts it all together from many lines into one line.  For simplicity, I knocked it down to 3 total coverages, though there are many more.  As I read the code, it seems to assume that all the info for one policy is together, like the 1, 2, or 3 rows for a specific policy are in order.  But, even when I, for example, order the table by the premium amount column, it still gets all the premium for one policy on one line.  I dont see anywhere in the code that should make this work.  The code is comparing the policy number on one line to the policy number on the next.  If they are the same, group the premium together.  If they are different, dont.  Again, I could order the table so that the records for one policy are not together, but the end result still comes out right.  Am I missing something  Is it something in Access doing it  Thanks for any helpp  precodeOption Compare Database Option Explicit   Premium is imported with one row for each coverage per policy, so possibly several rows per policy.  This procedure takes several rows per policy and makes them into one row.

Something like p  precodeDatabases[Default01].Count  NewCount codepre  pIs something like that possible Or is there no otherbetter way to update elements in an objectp  pCredit for the GetMDBMailboxCount function goes to  a hrefhttpblog.powershell.no20101121retrievenumberofmailboxesperdatabaseinexchangeserver2010 relnofollow titleherelinkap
Negative 79778 pI am trying to come up with a algorithm for the following problem.p  pThere is a set of N objects with M different variations of each object. The goal is to find which variation is the best for each object based on feedback from different users. p  pAt the end, the users will be placed in a category to determine which category prefers which variation.p  pIt is required that at most two variations of an object are placed side by side.  p  pThe problem with this is that if M is large then the number of possible combinations become too large and the user may become disinterested and potentially skew the results. p  pThe Elo algorithmscore can be used once I know the order of selection from the user as discussed in this this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3937218comparisonbasedrankingalgorithmComparison Based Ranking Algorithmap  pQuestionp  pIs there an algorithm that can reduce the number of possible combinations presented to a user and still get correct order  p  pexample 7 different types of fruits. Each fruit is available in 5 different shapes. The users give their ranking of 15 for each fruit based on the size they prefer. This means that for each fruit there are max 10 combinations the user has to choose from since sizes are different, no point presenting as 1,1. How would I reduce 10 combinations   p

Negative 79778 pFirstly I would like to say that I have researched this issue extensively and I realise that quite a few solutions have been posed on this site and others but absolutely none of them have worked for me. p  pUpon taking a picture my application allows the user to add Exif tags to the photo. After adding the data I would like the user to be able to return to the camera and continue taking pictures. However on returning to my camera activity I experience the aforementioned codejava.lang.RunTimeException Method called after releasecode error when I try to take another picture. p  pNow I realise that this is caused by the fact that I am trying to use the camera after I have released it and according to the Android API I need to recodeopencode the camera in my codeonResumecode method. When I do this however I get a codeFailed to connect to camera servicecode error. Many people have also suggested placing codemCamera.setPreviewCallbacknullcode in the codeonResumecode method but then this just also causes a codeMethod called after releasecode error.p  pHere is my logCatp  precode0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 java.lang.RuntimeException Method called                                                   after release 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.hardware.Camera.nativetakePictureNative Method 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.hardware.Camera.takePictureCamera.java789 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.hardware.Camera.takePictureCamera.java753 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at com.example.unititest.CameraActivity6.onClickCameraActivity.java180 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.view.View.performClickView.java2485 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.view.ViewPerformClick.runView.java9080 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java587 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java123 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java3687 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java507 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java842 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java600 0104 100308.187 EAndroidRuntime1876 at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pWhere error is thrownp  precode             Add a listener to the Capture button         Button captureButton  Button findViewByIdR.id.buttoncapture         captureButton.setOnClickListener             new View.OnClickListener                               Override                 public void onClickView v                                       Picture is taken and saved to file                     ERROR IS THROWN HERE                       mCamera.takePicturenull, null, mPicture                                                   codepre
Negative 79778 pDoes anyone have any recommendations how to implement thisp  ptable1 will constantly be codeINSERTcodeed into.  This necessitates that every row on table2 be codeUPDATEcoded upon each table1 codeINSERTcode.  Also, an algorithm that I dont know if MySQL would be best responsible for vs PHP calculation speed also has to be applied to each row of table2.p  pI wanted to have PHP handle it whenever the user did the codeINSERTcode, but I found out that PHP pages are not persistent after servering the connection to the user or so I understand, please tell me thats wrong so I can go that route.p  pSo now my problem is that if I use a total table codeUPDATEcode in a codeTRIGGERcode, Ill have locks galore or so I understand from InnoDBs locking when codeUPDATcodeing an entire table with a composite primary key since part of that key will be codeUPDATEcoded.p  pNow, Im thinking of using a cron job, but Id rather they fire upon a users codeINSERTcode on table1 instead of on a schedule.p  pSo I was thinking maybe a codeCURSORcode...p  pWhat way would be fastest and ABSOLUTELY NO LOCKING on table2p  pMany thanks in advancep  pstrongTable structurestrongp  ptable2 is all codeINTcodes for speed.

Negative 79778 pThe third normal form of database design asks you to remove functional dependencies. It  seeks to eliminate redundancy, removing from a table any attributes fields that can be calculated from the other fields. For instance, when you make a reference to another entity, you only store its key. You dont store replicas of attributes from these referred entities, because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity.p  pAnother situation is an attribute such as height. You want to know the height of a person, but in your application you may like to know it in different units meters, feet, astronomical units. But you dont store all of these values, you should remove calculated fields, so you only leave one of them meters, of course, and you calculate the transformed values on the fly, when you need it.p  pYou also dont store something like age, you calculate them from date of birth. In this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role. If you dont do this your data will soon be incorrect, unless you keep updating it constantly.p  pNow suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user. For each user we display his or her sign, which is calculated from the date and time of birth, and also from the astrological tradition of the users choice e.g. Western or Chinese. Calculating someones sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation, but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate. How would you design this database, would you remove this functionally dependent attribute, or would you calculate the users sign once, or every time she updates her date of birth, then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system, or would you enforce the 3NF rule with an iron fist And how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a users sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculatingp  pNow suppose a new application. You are building a system for the Army, that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts. Part of your system is a huge badass pattern recognition machine, developed at ORNL, that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts, based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database. This pattern recognition method looks at each persons height, date of birth, medical records, school transcript, and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires. It also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higherrank officers, and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time, to come up with a bunch of parameters for, say, a feedforward neural network. This neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system, but it is still a pretty involved calculation, not just a temperature unit conversion. Nevertheless, you can see it as a black box, and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database.p  pAt a specific date in the Armys calendar, the analysis is made, the ANN parameters are found, and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two. Its a pretty important thing. You will be deciding peoples occupations, you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen, and other to drive tanks. Everyone will be logging in the Armys network to check out their occupations, and see the result in their personal webpages.p  pNow, the little black box is there, and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database. The attributes and parameters will probably never change, and the calculation of the conscripts destiny will probably be always correct, always the same value form the first day. But would you really leave that outside the database, just to follow the remove calculated attributes rulep  pThis is not just some calculation of age, astrological sign or temperature conversion. The pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute. But would you really like to keep that inside your system forever, recalculating this hugely important thing over and over again Or would you consider it better to calculate everything once, and forget that this magical black box exists I mean, just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code emonceem some day, then pick the results, and record them in the database. When someone logs in to see the output from his analysis, make it so the query is just a boring datafetching procedure, and leave all the pettern recognition excitement for another time.p  pAnother more palpable situation You run a web store like Amazon. You have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people, that is fed from a users record in your DB. Would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations, or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system, just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs Wouldnt it be nice to have a control, for example, to make sure that you are not switching recommendations at an awkward moment... Dont worry too much about computational burden, assume excellent memory and computational resources.p  pTLDR  Do you think the rule of removing calculated attributes should never be broken, or would you say it is OK to store in the database the results from very important attributes, that are calculated by very complex and delicate pattern recognition methods Arent there situations where we should just pretend that you actually cannot perform the calculation on demand, and just leave recorded there these results, that wont be updated anywayp

Negative 79778 pI am working on a project which is using ExtJS 4.1p  pI need to implement a tree grid with filters. As per my understanding from reading various articles, blogs and SO posts, ExtJS does not provide filter mechanism with tree store and we need to write our own filtering mechanism.p  pFor filtering there are two approaches suggested  1 Load the data into the tree grid and then show  hide the node based on filter conditions 2 Manipulate the store copy the data and remove the record from the storep  pI tried first approach. It was working perfectly with the test data around 30 nodes.  But with the snapshot of production data, I was getting Unresponsive Script error in IE and FireFox. With Chrome it was working fine.p  pBasically the production database has large amount of data, around 3500 records which form around 900 nodes in the tree grid. I suspect, once the tree store is populated, while rendering all 900 nodes into the tree grid, I get Unresponsive Script error.p  pI am new to ExtJS and not sure what is the best way to tackle this problem. I would like to know, how does filtering works on grid. Can I replicate same filtering mechanism for Tree gridp  pAny suggestions to tackle this problem are welcome.p

Negative 79778 pI want to make an Android app which is dependent on other 3rdparty libraries, namely a hrefhttpsgithub.comJakeWhartonActionBarSherlock relnofollowActionBarSherlocka, and track the apps development in source control using Git.

Negative 79778 pI understand that mobile safari has a lot of bugs around fixed elements, but for the most part Ive managed to get my layout working correctly until I added a much needed text input to the fixed navigation at the bottom. Now when the user focuses on the text input element and the virtual keyboard appears, my navigation, which is otherwise always fixed at the bottom of the page, jumps up to a really strange spot in the middle of the page.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMB59e.jpg altenter image description herep  pId add some of my code to this post, but I wouldnt be sure where to start. That navigation is fixed at the bottom and positioned to the left and bottom 0, and 100 width.

Negative 79778 pIm in the planning stages for a webbased project managementcollaboration app similar to Copper Project or PHP Collab, using concrete5 as my framework.p  pThere are a couple of features I want to integrate, but Im not entirely sure how to accomplish this, looking at how DB tables are generated with blocks.p  pThe functionality I have in mind is as follows 1 When a new client is created by an account manager or project manager, they have to assign a threecharacter prefix for the client. Example if by some wild stroke of luck I add Diesel as a client, I would want to assign them the prefix DSL.p  p2 When an account manager or project manager creates a new project, the project ID should be directly related to the client, and not to the total number of projects for all clients. In other words, the project ID for Diesels first project with me should be DSL001, and not DSL016, because there were fifteen other projects for other clients before this one c.f. both Copper and PHP Collab, which follow the global project ID logic, as opposed to the perclient project ID logic. This project ID would be visible on the frontend project page thats been created by the AMPM, and would also be used as a reference ID for things like cost estimates, invoices and so on.p  pSo this is where I run into a problem from a workflow planning point of view. My understanding of MySQL is such that if I want to follow my own project ID logic, a new table would have to be created for each and every client, to contain all of the data concerning their projects, so that the DB could correctly output the unique ID number.p  pHowever, my understanding of C5 is that if, for example, in the course of creating this app, I decide to create the project form as a block to be inserted in a frontend template, the db.xml file would create a generic project data table in the DB for all clients, not one per client.p  pAny suggestions how I can accomplish what Im looking to do in the context of C5s frameworkp  pIf somethings unclear, I can show some mockups of how a project page would look.p  pThanks p

Negative 79778 pI had a Could not load file or assembly emem.dll or one of its dependencies. on a CCLI dll called from a C program. I eventually nailed this down to the use of a codepragma ompcode directive. If I remove all openmp directives and build, the assembly can be loaded. As soon as I add a single openmp directive, I get this exception. Of course, the compiler option openmp was enabled.p  pThis is on Visual Studio 2012 using the .NET 3.5 framework. Is there anything I can do to make this work This is performancecritical code that has to compile with OpenMP.

Negative 79778 pI am working on an online form system, with forms that will need to be updated over time. I am using Knockout.js in conjunction with the Mapping plugin to accomplish this and it is working well.p  pOne problem I am having, however, is that it seems to be refusing to save any properties on a ViewModel that werent in the JSON object loaded from the database. For instance, if the ViewModel that was saved to the DataBase looked like thisp  precodevar viewModel       prop1 ko.observable,     prop2 ko.observable,     prop3 ko.observableArray  codepre  pI initialize the viewModel variable to this prototype, and then load my JSON data from the server, codeko.mapping.fromJSONdata, , viewModelcode and this works as expected. Here is where my problem is If my viewModel now has an extra property, like sop  precodevar viewModel       prop1 ko.observable,     prop2 ko.observable,     prop3 ko.observableArray,     prop4 ko.observableArray  codepre  pIf I load JSON data created based on the firsts prototype, I can access this fourth property in the viewModel, adding and removing from the array and seeing it updated on the screen, but it will not save back to the database using codeko.mapping.toJSONviewModelcode. Im gathering that is has something to do with the emkoemmapping properties that get assigned to the parts of the viewModel that were mapped using the mapping plugin. I apologize if this situation has been addressed before, but I could not find the answer.p  pI need to be able to update the prototype for the viewModel as its particular requirements could vary slightly over time. This could happen to any of my forms, so a generic solution would be fantasticp  pThank you.p

Negative 79778 pWe have a repository running SVN. At some moment, to add a feature lets call it branch, we created a development branch from the main trunk lets call it trunk.p  pWe kept doing our work and commiting to the branch, occasionally, we merged changes made in the trunk into the branch to keep it the branch up to date with the trunk.p  pAt some point, revisions 75051 to 77691 from the trunk were merged into the branch, and commits kept going on the branch, commiting new code in the branch.p  pBut now we want the branch to be up to date with the trunk only up to revision 77089, that is, we want to undo the changes in the branch due to the merge we did, but only changes due to rev7708977691, without affecting all work done in the branch. Any suggestions to revert or undo the changes in the branch due to rev7708977691 in the trunk Thank you very much.p

This works however when scrolling or zooming out quickly, sometimes the overlay flickers off and you can briefly see the background map behind so not ideal.p  pNumber 3, and this is what I have been working on for a few days now is to simply prevent the user from zooming out. Most documented methods tend to use regionDidChangeAnimated or regionWillChangeAnimated, however these do not seem to suddenly stop the map zooming out when pinching  they wait until the pinch movement has finished before taking effect so again it means the background map can be viewed briefly.p  pSo now I am stumped, unless of course I have missed something with these other two methods.p  pSo any help would be much appreciatedp

And one can not be sure which class does a reference comparison and which class does a value comparison.p  pThis means that codeequalscode can not be used in a generic, because the generic would not do the same for all types. And it is also not possible to restrict the generic type in a way that only types are acceptable which implement the correct value comparison.p  pSo the question is how to do a reliable value comparison in a generic Do I have to write it on my own from scratchp  pBy the way I think Javas equal failure does not start with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8777266402322Arraya. It starts already with Object. I think it is wrong that codeequalscode for two objects returns codefalsecode. It must return codetruecode, because if you do a value comparison of something which does not have a value the values can not differ and therefor they must be the same. Scheme does it in that way and it is perfectly reasonable codeequal vector vector gt tcode.p

Negative 79778 pMy root question is how to benefit from the unchecked generics type Eclipse compiler warning, but not have the list of those warnings in the Problems view polluted by noise from java classes which are generated from xsd files by xjc via mavenjaxb2plugin.p  pIve read other places that I can ignore compiler warnings per source folder and that would be great, but I dont have the authority to place the generated code it its own source folder. p  pGiven my situation, my assumption is that the easiest and most durable way to do this would be to use jaxb binding files .xjb to add SuppressWarnings at the class level of all of the classes that jaxb generates.  However Im not very smart on using xjc, I just see how itmaveneclipse are wired together to generate .java files from the .xsd files.  So this leads to 2 questions.  First, am I wrong to think this possibleeasy  Second, if that is easy whats a good way at getting started on accomplishing thisp

Negative 79778 pI have a program that is linked against a shared library libFoo.so. Now I needed to write a patched version of that library. Call it libFooPatch although the name will be libFoo.so too. This one defines an additional weak symbol Init.p  pFirst scenario just for clarificationbr Now suppose I would have implemented Init in the program. At runtime libFooPatch is loaded through LDLIBRARYPATH.br If the program was linked against libFoo calling Init from libFooPatch causes it to call only the weak referenced version, not the one from the program. Linking it against libFooPatch fixes that and it works without any problems.br 1 But why is that Shouldnt at runtime the strong referenced Init from the program be called  p  pNow the real problem 2nd scenariobr I cannot change the program itself. It does not define Init and is linked against libFoo. I can change libFooPatch which is still instead of libFoo by placing it into LDLIBRARYPATH.br I want to write a shared library libBar that is used in the program most probably by dlopen, defines Init as a strong symbol and make libFooPatch call this one.br However I cant get it to work. My own Init function is never called and even obtaining a pointer within libBar gets me only the weak one from libFooPatch.p  pnm libBar.so returns 0000000000000eb0 T Init so it is correctly defined there, isnt itp  pAny pointers how I can get this to workp

Negative 79778 pI am working on creating an ERD thru Oracle Data Modeler. Unfortunately, within the database the primary keys are not defined as a constraint, rather an index is set up on the primary key. I think this is why Oracle cant detect the primary keys and set them automatically. I didnt set up the database and cant make any changes.p  pIs there an easier way to have Oracle pull in the primary key from the index as opposed to going thru and defining each tables primary key There are over a hundred tables within the database.p  pThanksp

Negative 79778 pWe are using Liferay Portal 6.0, and the portlets are Primefaces 3.4, JSF 2.1, We support having more than one browser tab opened for the same user, and each tab can have up to 15 portlets at a time, each portlet is displaying a JSF page codeViewScopedBeancode using codeiframecode.p  pThe problem is that the opened JSF pages inside a codeiframecode inside a portlet dont know when their portlets get closed or when the whole browser tab gets closed, So they stay in memory until session times out. And this is causing a major problem in server memory leading to complete failure. p  pMy questions are How can I have the list of opened pages views from server side and how can I also close them I know that a codeViewScopedBeancode gets destroyed when it is redirected to another page a dummy page as a workaround, so can I redirect each page from the list If I can have it from server sidep  pThank you very much in advance.p

I love my eyecandy in a terminal, and id do it myself if I could figure out a resource that explains something similar. p

Negative 79778 pHi I am making a c game which involves flipping over cards in order to match the colours. I have the game pretty much complete however the one thing I cant figure out is how I can make sure that there is an even number of card generated. I have a total of 8 colours, and I want 2 of each so that there are no left over cards at the end of the game which cannot be matched. p  pAt the moment I am generating the cards using a random number generator. The cards are in the form of a 2D array of buttons. I set up this array by looping through the array and generating a number, every loop depending on the number generated this gives the button a tag. p  pAfter this is complete when a button is pressed it will change colour depending on the number it was given.p

Will it be an error or just variable which is supposed to get the item will stay empty p  pI am asking it because I want to check if in db is already the element to avoid duplicates, if you have any other way feel free to post itp  pEDIT What is unclear about this question I have asked what do I get if I execute SELECT query in SQLite android and the element is not present in the DB what value will have the cursor or what is the result. Is it an error or null value or what As I already found out it is null value in cursor.

Just use the cursor.getCount method to determine it it contains 0 rowsp

Negative 79778 pI was wondering if there was any best practices or rules that can help to determine whether deep navigation should be allowed from an object root or not. So far, Ive almost always preferred to hide all implementation details, but it might be overkill.p  pBy deep navigation, I mean something like codehttpResponse.status.textcode rather than codehttpResponse.statusTextcode considering that codeHttpResponsecode encapsulates a codeHttpStatuscode object.p  pThe latter completely hide implementation details, but also requires more code. I understand the example is perhaps oversimplictic and codeHttpResponsecode has no invariants to enforce other than preventing a codenullcode status, but its enough to expose the problem.p  pPlease note that we can consider codeHttpStatuscode as immutable for the example.p  pIt might not be the best example, but we can also use any example where composition is used over inheritance.p

Negative 79778 pIm trying to get up and running with Elmah for an MVC 5 WebAPI app. All the docs Im finding seem to start and end with install it via nuget and just assume thatll cover it, but Im clearly missing something. Ive installed Elmah.MVC 2.1.1 via nuget, and I am able to view the error log at elmah. Im able to request an invalid route and see that the resulting 404 error is getting logged by Elmah, even with customErrors turned on. However, if I generate an unhandled error within a controller, or during controller instantiation, nothing is getting logged to Elmah. For instancep  precode[HttpGet, Routeapihealth] [ApiExplorerSettingsIgnoreApi  true] public HttpResponseMessage GetHealth      throw new ExceptionWhoops.  codepre  pI can call this all day long and nothing shows up in the Elmah log. Adding the standard HandleError attribute doesnt change anything, and the little bit of docs a hrefhttpsgithub.comalexanderbeletskyelmahmvc relnofollowherea seems pretty explicit that I shouldnt have to create a custom HandleError attribute. p  pI use Ninject for DI, and similarly if I break a dependency binding Ill get a nice error like thisp  precode     Message An error has occurred.     ExceptionMessage An error occurred when trying to create a controller of type HealthController. Make sure that the controller has a parameterless public constructor.     ...  codepre  pBut nothing makes it to the Elmah log in that case either. p  pI assume in both cases this is because MVC is handling those errors for me formatting the exceptions as JSON, etc and not passing them on to Elmah. How do I configure things so that any exception not handled within a controller is logged by Elmahp

Negative 79778 pIm currently trying to integrate the lastest Facebook php sdk into a Phalcon project but Im not having much luck. p  pI can get the SDK to work in a standalone project but the exact same code fails when integrated into a Phalcon project either as a service or directly in a Controller. p  pThe issue seems to be that the facebook redirect helper creates a state property which is appended to a loginUrl and then stored in a session. When a user is redirected back to my site after signing in, it checks this property against a querystring value. The state property is only generated and stored whenever you display the login url via the redirectHelpers getLoginUrl method. Somehow, when I integrate this in Phalcon the session variable and the GET parameter never seem to match up. The simple example which works is as followsp  precode  lots of requires  FacebookFacebookSessionsetDefaultApplicationappId,secret  helper  new FacebookFacebookRedirectLoginHelperhttp.SERVER[HTTPHOST] .   see if a existing session exists  if  isset SESSION  ampamp isset SESSION[fbtoken]       create new session from saved accesstoken       session  new FacebookSession SESSION[fbtoken]      validate the accesstoken to make sure its still valid   try           if  sessiongtvalidate            session  null        catch  Exception e        catch any exceptions         session  null            end if issetSESSION   if  isset session   session  null      no session exists    try            session  helpergtgetSessionFromRedirect     catch FacebookRequestException ex        When Facebook returns an error       handle this better in production code       printr ex       catch Exception ex        When validation fails or other local issues       handle this better in production code        printr ex                          see if we have a session    if  isset session          save the session      SESSION[fbtoken]  sessiongtgetToken       create a session using saved token or the new one we generated at login        session  new FacebookSession sessiongtgetToken            graph api request for user data         request  new FacebookRequest session, GET, me           response  requestgtexecute            get response         graphObject  responsegtgetGraphObjectgtasArray            print profile data             echo ltpregt . printr graphObject, 1  . ltpregt                 print logout url using session and redirecturi logout.php page should destroy the session                echo lta href . helpergtgetLogoutUrl session, httpyourwebsite.comapplogout.php  . gtLogoutltagt        else       show login url       echo lta href . helpergtgetLoginUrl array email, userfriends   . gtLoginltagt  this line would generate a new state       codepre  pWhen I try using this exact same code in a controller in a phalcon project or by setting me up in the di, the state check always fails even though Im not generating a new login url.

Negative 79778 pIm currently setting up a staging environment, on which I ran into a problem with PHP codecryptcode. We deployed the same code with the same data into the same environment emUbuntu 14.04, Apache 2.2.25, PHP 5.4.17, mySQL 5.6.11em, everything set up by the same setup script, but we couldnt login into our platform. The passwords were hashed using codecryptcode as followsp  precodesaltedPassword  userSalt . userInput . systemSalt randomSalt  someFunctionWithMtRandOutputting22Chars hash  cryptsaltedPassword, 2y15 . randomSalt userDaogtstorePasswordhash codepre  pcodeuserSaltcode is a constant date tied with the user like his ID, codeuserInputcode ist the actual password sent from the frontend. An example hash would be code2y15X8ozNErDV1SU1wdTdAW7JOgeYt4C7okLB0.9pR9HkM.fqtj7H.ecode .p  pTo login, the portal uses this codep  precodehash  userDaogtgetPassword saltedPassword  userSalt . userInput . systemSalt authorized  cryptsaltedPassword, hash  encryptedPassword  if authorized  true, login codepre  pThis code works perfectly fine on 5 different machines production and development. When using the same code in the stage environment, the second codecryptcode call returns a different result, in this case code2y15X8ozNErDV1SU1wdTdAW7JOsxs7kdiTp3Bp0QuuOUcYs6zXkaq6dgqcode . While the salt part of the password is identical and indicating that the correct algorithm was chosen [Blowfish], the second part differs from the stored hash.p  pI tested the known constants codeCRYPTSALTLENGTHcode and codeCRYPTBLOWFISHcode on all systems, and all values were the same. I tested the code on the command line, and all systems returned the same hash, but surprisingly not the one stored in the database, but the wrong one. Could this be a hint for a misconfigurationp  pThe only known difference between the existing, working environments and the new, faulting stage environment is, that the stage environment is set up as a codechrootcode environment on our test server. Could this difference be the cause for my problemp

Negative 79778 pIm not quite sure how to use a decorator on an inherited method. Normally decorators are put before the definition but for an inherited function the definition is given in the parent and not the child class. I would like to avoid rewriting the definition of the method in the child class and simply specify to put the decorator around the inherited method.p  pTo make myself clearer, here is a working example of what I meanp  precodeclass Person     def initself, age         self.age  age      classmethod     def getsdrinkcls,          print its time to get a drink         return A beer  def decsomef     def legalissueobj,         somefobj         return A Coke     return legalissue  class ChildPerson     def initself, age         Person.initself, ageage      in principle id like to write     dec     self.getsdrink     which does not work     the only working way I found is by defining the method as a classmethod     and write this      dec     def getsdrinkself,          return Person.getsdrink  dad  Person42 son  Child12  print dad.getsdrink print son.getsdrink codepre  pThe way it is done in this example works, but it looks somehow weird to me, replacing the method with a call to the original method only to be able to put the decorator. Also, for this to work, the method needs to be defined as a classmethod in the parent class.p  pAm I missing something How would experienced developers do thisp  pAny help, insights, critical comments and free coffees are much appreciatedp

Negative 79778 pstrongEDIT ANSWER FOUNDstrongp  pI realize why its not working. The filters config field i was reading about was based on the Ext.data.AbstractStore classs config, not Rallys Rally.data.wsapi.Store config. Rally doesnt support the filter functions becasue all Rally.data.wsapi.Store filters get turned into the wsapi query syntax I read that in the SDK guide, which you cannot do with functions. That is why they only accept the Object[] argument, not Function[] argument.p  pSo please correct me if Im wrong, but i believe that the documentation for the wsapi Stores are wrong for the filters config field. p  hr  pI am trying to use a customized filter function to load Features from a list of User Stories. My issue is with understanding how filter functions work for the store Configuration. Right now i havep  precodeloadFeatures functioncb      var me  this     Ext.createRally.data.wsapi.Store,         model PortfolioItemFeature,         autoLoadtrue,         start 0,         pageSize 20,         fetch stuff         context stuff         filters[             functionfeature return false ,             functionfeature                 return feature.getRelease.Name  me.releaseRecord.getName             ,             functionfeature                 var oid  feature.getObjectID                 var rs  me.StoryStore.getRecords                 forvar i  0iltrs.lengthi                     var r  rs[i]                     ifr.getFeature ampamp r.getFeature.ObjectID  oid                          return true                                  return false                      ],         listeners stuff      , codepre  pThere are a few things that are confusing mep  p1 One of my functions returning false no matter what, which I believe should return NO results. Yet the store returns all of the Features, like there were no filters at all it returns the first page of results, but the pages include all featuresp  p2 can we tread the parameters in the filter functions as records or the records data, similar to record.data. What i mean is should I be using record.getObjectID or record.ObjectID. p  p3 can I even use the 3rd filter function above, because it requires scoped variables, and  the filtering is done server side. Are the scope variables preserved.p  pI dont know the answers to these because i cant put console logs in the filter functions, as they are filtered server side. p

Negative 79778 pThis question has been raised many times but I couldnt find any concrete sample on how to solve the problem. As you know many mobile devices, especially those running iOS dont allow users to copy an image from a web page and paste its URL in an aspTextBox . However the image URL can be pasted in the browsers address field. I find this akward.p  pMy scenario is that I have a picture album on an aspx page. On the same page there is a rich text editor. On desktops, users can drag the image from the album to the editor. Of course this works well on desktop computers but not on most mobile devices so my plan B was to allow the user to copy the image URL and paste it in the textarea. But that doesnt work either. Is there any concrete javascript simple code on how to work around that problem I found couple of tricks but they didnt make sense to me.... They are too heavy for a mobile device.

Negative 79778 pI am currently developing a node.js webapp, which can access a subversion server with a nice web UI.p  pTo access the server I need authentication data. My first attempt was to store them with codeapp.setusername, theocodeand codeapp.setpassword, startcode. Later I saw, that this is a very bad idea, because then, the authdata are going to be in the app settings until it restarts.p  pMy question is now, how can I store data during a session over multiple requests using nodejs and expressp  pPS A database is sadly no option...p

Negative 79778 pI have a collection of modules to be initialised and 3 of the modules take a long time whereas others take very little time to initialise.

I need all modules to be initialised before the UI thread can continue otherwise the UI will start up very quickly after the first module initialised and UI becomes an empty shell due to other modules still uninitialized. Is there any way to achieve each module initialised on separate thread and the main thread will wait until they are ALL initialised Hope I have made myself clear. Thanks.p
Negative 79778 pI have been using codesizeWithAttributescode in order to obtain the codewidthcode and codeheightcode required in order to draw an codeNSAttributedStringcode. This is working well to get the codewidthcode because the value returned for width fits the characters very snuggly  its calculated from the first character to the last without any additional padding added. But for codeheightcode, its returning a value larger than I would like. This is because it must calculate the codeheightcode starting at the top of the tallest letter and extending down to the bottom of the lowest character  for example the g character extends below the baseline.p  pI dont believe this API is intelligent because none of the characters in my string extend below the baseline, yet the height returned is too tall. It seems to be considering any possible character that could be displayed with those attributes.p  pI am in need of a way to subtract the amount of extra padding below the string. I want to calculate where the baseline is relative to the codeheightcode, or some other way to calculate how much space is dedicated to the area beneath the baseline. The illustration below explains visually what I believe to be occurring, although the padding amount is a little extreme.p  precode  greetings               ltget rid of this extra padding  codepre  pI believe codeboundingRectWithSizeoptionscontextcode would give me the same dimensions, and Im not aware of any other nondeprecated API that calculates string sizes.p

Negative 79778 pI found a few questions on Stackoverflow like this but no answer yet. Im trying to stream camera input from an Android device to a HTML5 video tag for some realtime image processing.

Negative 79778 pIm very new to AngularJS, and have tried to find an answer to my following question around the web.p  pSo my issue is as follows I have a handler .ashx file on my site.

Negative 79778 pI am writing a commandline todo list program in C and am getting some weird behavior. Todos are stored in structs which contain an codeintcode priority and a codechar[128]code name. They are created using a function that takes in these parameters and returns an allocated and initialized struct with those values. p  pThe returned structs are initially correct, but after initializing 8 more struct variables, the value of the firstinitialized structs begins to change. My guess is that previous values are being overwritten by new ones due to not enough memory being allocated. Ive fixed this problem temporarily by increasing the size fed to codemalloccode from codesizeofTaskPcode to codesizeofint  sizeofchar[128]code. However, I am sure there is a better way and would much appreciate an explanation of why codemallocsizeofTaskPcode is not allocating enough memory if that is the case and the proper convention.p  pHere is my codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt  struct Task      char description[128]               description of the task      int priority                        task priority    typedef  struct Task Task   Task createTask int priority, char desc    Task newTask  mallocsizeofTask   if newTask      newTaskgtpriority  priority     strcpynewTaskgtdescription, desc      return newTask   int mainint argc, const char  argv[]      Task taskList[10]      Task task1  createTask9, task 1     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority   I put printfs      Task task2  createTask3, task 2     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority   after every call      Task task3  createTask2, task 3     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority   to createTask      Task task4  createTask4, task 4     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority   to watch the value      Task task5  createTask5, task 5     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority   of task1 change      Task task6  createTask7, task 6     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority     Task task7  createTask8, task 7     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority     Task task8  createTask6, task 8     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority     Task task9  createTask1, task 9     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority     Task task10  createTask0, task 10     printftask1 dn, task1gtpriority      return 0  codepre  pAnd here is my outputp  precodetask1 9 task1 9 task1 9 task1 9 task1 9 task1 9 task1 9 task1 0 task1 1802723700 task1 1802723700 codepre  h2strongUPDATEstrongh2  pI literally figured out the problem seconds after posting to stack overflow.

Negative 79778 pSuppose there there is a scene as follows  There is a scene with the same size as the frame of the device. The scene has a red ball, which is able to move throughout the world. This world is defined by black and white areas, where the ball is ONLY able to move in the area that is white. Here is a picture to help explain img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL1lMN.png altPicture of the scenep  pParts of the black area can be erased, as if the user is drawing with white color over the scene. This would mean that the area in which the ball can be moved is constantly changing. Now, how would one go about implementing a physicsBody for the an edge between the white and black areas p  pI tried redefining the physicsBody every time it is changed, but once the shape becomes complex enough, this isnt a viable solution at all. I tried creating a twodimensional array of boxes that are invisible and specify whether most of the area within each box is white or black, and if the ball touched a box that was black, it would be pushed back. However, this required heavy rendering and iterating over the array too much. Since my original array contained boxes a little bigger than a pixel, I tried making these boxes bigger to smooth the motion a little, but this eventually caused part of the ball to be stopped by white areas and appear to be inside the black area. This was undesired, since the user could feel invisible barriers that they seemed to be hitting.p  pI tried searching for other methods to implement this destructible terrain type scene, but the solutions that I found and tried were using other game engines. To further clarify, I am using ObjectiveC and Apples SpriteKit framework and I am not looking for a detailed class full of code, but rather some pseudocode or implementation ideas that would lead me to a solution.p  pThank you.p

What I want is a purely functional UI, where I can replay the inmemory event log to restore the UI state the event log is not persisted on browser close, it is just to make things easy to reason about and potentially enable cool features like UI undoredo for free, time travelling debugger like in ELM...p  hr  pI just wonder sometimes how to choose the right level of abstraction for events as it seems to me there may be multiple interpretations of something that just happened. p  pBasically, in a JS SPA, many events are triggered after an user has clicked on a button, on a link or something like that. So I could add an entry to my event log being this lowlevel event after managing to make it serializable. But this event can also be interpreted as a representation of what the user really has done in a high level abstraction.p  pTo give an exemple, lets say I have on my UI a popup that is displayed at some point.  When the user clicks anywhere outside of the popup, it should be closed. Lets imagine now the user clicks to a codedivcode outside of the popup to close it. What event abstraction level am I supposed to add to the event logp  ul liUser has clicked on codedivcode li liUser has clicked outside of the popup li liUser has closed the popup li ul  pThese 3 event abstractions seems correct to me they describe in the past something that happened, but at different abstraction levels. So Im asking myself some questions likep  ul liDo I have to choose one of the 3 abstraction level If so how to chooseli liCan or should I fire all 3 events If so, wouldnt the event log becomes a bit messyli liShould I use concepts like DDD Saga, so that when receiving a user clicked div event, the Saga could fire a close popup command or somethingli ul

I am using Xcode 6.1, compiling with iOS 8.1.p  pstrongScenario strongp  pI wanted to make UITextView non touchable, just like UILabel  i am using UITextView instead of UILabel because my text may be 1 or 2 line and UILabel aligns text at vertically center of view for 1 line and for 2 lines it starts from top left, i want it to start from top left in both cases which is easily achievable by textview . p  pTo make it non touchable first i disabled codeselectablecode property of it from Storyboard and tried to run application. After unchecking codeselectablecode property my text views text not using the colour i set for it  i have set red colour  and it is using default black colour. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYKQCe.png altenter image description herep  pIf i check codeselectablecode, text colour follows whatever i set in interface builder.p  pstrongIssues strongp  ol lipWhy unchecking of codeselectablecode property from interface builder doesnt follow whatever textcolor i set for textview.pli lipOne more thing i noticed, if i uncheck codeselectablecode property from interface builder and tried to set it programmatically like codetextViewOne.selectable  YEScode then also TextView doesnt follow whatever textcolor i set in interface builder, only checking that property from interface builder works.  Tried with clean build, restarting xcode also pli ol  p I know i should just make textviews user interaction disabled to make it non touchable, but i accidentally unchecked codeselectablecode and it took my time to figure out what was happening, so just wanted to know was i doing something wrong or this is some kind of issue or this is correct behaviour of this control. p

Negative 79778 pIm new to Symfony and am starting an app which includes an admin section. The general advice is pretty obvious  make an AdminBundle.p  pHowever, is that really the best practice The Symfony documentation is saying that a bundle is intended to be a plugin that can be distributed as is, and will work in another app. Doesnt the admin section need to be aware of all the models and things for the main app though Its an admin section created to administer changes specifically to my app, so how would it be distributable or selfcontainedp  pI feel like Im missing something because if all the advice is to make an AdminBundle then I obviously dont understand something or havent delved far enough into Symfony yet.p  pIm just looking to get my app started with the correct structure going forward.p  pFYI, I created a project with the default AppBundle as well. I was just planning to make everything in there, but that doesnt seem right either as it will be harder to organise all the admin stuff separately.p

Negative 79778 pI was starting a project today and after designing the database structure and how the data would be stored etc, I started the implementation. I am doing this on php, but the language isnt really relevant here, since my doubts are more architectured related or I guess, since Im struggling more than I thought by implenting stuff in OOP on PHP. Recently jumped on php, Ive been coding in c and java before. p  pSo, I started by creating my User class, simple as that, few attributes, and construct, insert, update and delete methods. Those last 3, queries to the db.p  pThen this doubt came to my head, and I probably know the answer myself but I just dont find out.p  pI can now create instances and create new Users codeuser  new UserJohn, 34code but, what if I want to edit the user Dave Or I want to show all users. That method, for example, codegetAllUserscode which would return all users where would be implemented Because it doesnt really belong to the class User does it If it did, then how I would instance that method if I dont have any User instancep  pI guess, I would need a class Users, or UserCollection which would be a collection of all the users, with the methods getCertainUserid and getAllUsers which would return certain User or All of them, now then I would have a User I would be able to edit, rightp  pThat being said, my questions is, how this problem should be addressed as the way to go, Am I complicating things too much How this should be solved the correct way in OOP. The times Ive handled similar problems Ive never used a database, so having a collection of users was the only way to store them, but having the database which stores the users feels redundant to have that collection of users.p  pThanks in advance.p

This doesnt happen when I open or close the drawer by swiping right on mobile.p  pThe expected behavior is as seen in this Polymer Mail app a hrefhttpspolymail.appspot.com relnofollowhttpspolymail.appspot.comap  pIm not sure if this happens because of tag positioning but Ive tried several combinations and even dealt with pointerevents none, but that still doesnt solve it.p  pHeres my code for the coredrawerpanel and main contentp  precodeltlink relimport hrefavatars.htmlgt ltlink relimport hreflevelimages.htmlgt ltlink relimport hreflevelicons.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coredrawerpanelcoredrawerpanel.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coreheaderpanelcoreheaderpanel.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coreitemcoreitem.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coremenucoremenu.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coretoolbarcoretoolbar.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coreselectorcoreselector.htmlgt ltlink relimport href..coreiconcoreicon.htmlgt  ltpolymerelement namelevels attributesuser labels level wide allScores vertical layoutgt  lttemplategt  ltlink relstylesheet hreflevels.cssgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefthemes.cssgt  ltcoredrawerpanel forceNarrowgt ltcoreheaderpanel modescroll drawergt ltcoretoolbar idnavheader classtallgt ltcoreicon iconavatarsavataruser.avatar classtop gameavatar idprofileavatargtltcoreicongt ltdiv classbottom idprofileusergtuser.nameltdivgt ltcoretoolbargt ltcoremenu stylepointerevents nonegt   ltpaperitemgtltcoreicon iconsocialtrophygtltcoreicongtTrophiesltpaperitemgt   ltpaperitemgtltcoreicon iconsocialpeoplegtltcoreicongtFriendsltpaperitemgt   ltpaperitemgtltcoreicon iconstargtltcoreicongtFavoritesltpaperitemgt   ltpaperitemgtltcoreicon iconsocialsharegtltcoreicongtShareltpaperitemgt ltcoremenugt ltcoreheaderpanelgt  ltdiv classlevels flex auto maingt  ltcoretoolbar classlevelstoolbar slidedownparentElement.selected  level ampamp parentElement.lastSelected  levelgt     ltpapericonbutton iconmenu coredrawertogglegtltpapericonbuttongt   ltdiv flex classusernamegtuser.nameltdivgt    ltcoreicon iconsocialtrophygtltcoreicongt    ltdiv classscoregtuser.score ptsltdivgt     ltcoretoolbargt  ltcoreselector classlevelslist content  wide wide  tokenList  selectedselected slideupparentElement.selected  level ampamp parentElement.lastSelected  level fadeparentElement.lastSelected  introgt    ltdiv classlevel1 vertical layoutgt     ltdiv classtile themebga dummy fitgtltdivgt     ltdiv classtile flex vertical layoutgt       ltdiv flex relativegt         lt sizing wrapper gt         ltdiv fit layout vertical center centerjustifiedgt           ltdiv classlevelbgwrapper relativegt             ltcoreicon iconleveliconsgardenarea classleveltilebg fitgtltcoreicongt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt       ltdiv classlevelname horizontal center layoutgt         ltdiv flexgtGarden Arealtdivgt         ltcoreicon classlevelicon iconkeyboardaltgtltcoreicongt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt    ltdiv classlevelitem garden vertical layoutgt     ltdiv classtile themebga dummy fitgtltdivgt     ltdiv classtile flex auto vertical layoutgt       ltdiv flex auto relativegt         lt sizing wrapper gt         ltdiv fit layout vertical center centerjustifiedgt           ltdiv classlevelbgwrapper relativegt             ltcoreicon iconleveliconsgardenarea classleveltilebg fitgtltcoreicongt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt       ltdiv classlevelname horizontal center layoutgt         ltdiv flexgtIslandltdivgt         ltcoreicon classlevelicon iconterraingtltcoreicongt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt  ltcoreselectorgt  ltdivgt ltcoredrawerpanelgt  lttemplategt  ltscriptgt  Polymergamelevels,   wide false,  created function    this.levels  [] ,  selectedChanged function    if this.selected  0      this.level  name gardenarea    else if this.selected  this.levels.length  1      this.level  name island    else      this.level  this.levels[this.selected  1]        ltscriptgt ltpolymerelementgt codepre  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 79778 pLets say I have a micro controller and I know that when it receives an interrupt it will jump to address 0x8000 just as an example.  How do I define that in C, it seems like it might be similar to casting an address to a variable so I can read or write memory.p  pUsually the support package comes with some pragma statement or other way to indicate where your interrupt code is.   But I want to understand how you would do just do it in standard C.   Some kind of function pointers or somethingp

Negative 79778 pI am developing a static website in AngularJS and I am stuck on an SEO issue. Basically my google webmasters tools tell that there are no crawl errors however when I try to fetch different routes it always returns the same home page result. It doesnt read what is injected in the ngview div. It just shows the static text in my index.html file. The weird thing is that it actually reads my directive of the landing page  because when it renders it reads my navbar, footer, and content, which I have put in an indexwidget directive but as I said it reads nothing from the ngview directive. Any help would be appreciated. Here is the page a hrefhttpluxtest.tk relnofollowhttpluxtest.tka  Thanksp

Does this mean if I set a default header using a simple dictionary my codeHttpClient clientcode will not be as efficient as the one which uses codeDefaultRequestHeaderscode In addition I really cant understand how the values inside codeDefaultRequestHeaderscode will be reused Lets say I create 20 codeHttpClient clientcode using codeHttpClientFactory.Createcode and inside every single one of them I set codeDefaultRequestHeaderscode property [Do I really need to do it because DefaultRequestHeaders was meant to be reused]. Where does this reuse kickin and does setting the codeDefaultRequestHeaderscode every time I create a codeHttpClient clientcode result in some kind of performance hitp

again it collapses.p  pUsing Visibility on the expandable control would be an option except I want a growing animation, having the Height increase until its full height, instead of the snapping effect that the Visibility provides.p  pI also messed around with the ScaleY effect and it is almost what I want, except the parent reserves the Height for the expandable control even when this is with ScaleY  0 leaving a big unwanted space between every element on the list and it makes sense.p  pNow the working solution as demonstrated above is having a set Height value on the control and varying between this one and 0. But I would like to achieve a more reusable solution without having to hardcode the height.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 79778 pIf this is a duplicate Im sorry, I searched for it but couldnt find it.p  pIm currently writing a voxel based 3D game using MonoGame and BEPUphysics. The problem is that in order to not be dependent on XNA or MonoGame, BEPUphysics created its own Vector2, Vector3, and Matrix classes. BEPUphysics provides a MathConverter class with a heavily overloaded Convert function for converting between its classes and the structurally identical XNA classes.  All each function does is create a new instance of the desired type and right to left all of the properties.  This is a very straightforward method of doing it but it feels like there should be other ways since the block of memory each class uses should be the same size and layout as well. So are there other ways to achieve the same result What are the pros and cons of these ways primarily with respect to speed but also just in general Or is a naive right to left implementation the only or best way Even though both projects are open source and I technically could modify them to be the same type or at least have a same base type , Id rather not do that and the question still stands for a situation where one or both of the classes is in a compiled closed source assembly.p

If the local fitness is smaller than the selection threshold,         renderBitmapString1.5, 0.9, void font, then go to Step 13,          renderBitmapString1.5, 1, void font, else go to Step 20          renderBitmapString1.7, 1.1, void font, 19. Replace flytokill by a new fly with a random position, go to Step 22         renderBitmapString1.7, 1.2, void font, 20. Replace flytokill by a new fly based on flytoreproduce         renderBitmapString1.7, 1.3, void font, 21. Add the flys contribution to the population         renderBitmapString1.7, 1.4, void font, 22. If stop the reconstruction,         renderBitmapString1.5, 1.5, void font, then go to Step 23,          renderBitmapString1.5, 1.6, void font, else go to Step 4          renderBitmapString1.7, 1.7, void font, 23.

Negative 79778 pI have SonarQube installed as a plugin in Eclipse, on a machine connected behind a corporate firewall. I am able to access the website of the sonar server available on a remote machine outside the local network using the internal browser in Eclipse. The analysis runs successfully with my current configuration when I am not behind the firewall. When I am behind the firewall, the project association, connection test of the server configuration and retrieval of remote issues of projects works fine. The analysis fails with the following error messagep  precodeRetrieve remote issues of project ... Start SonarQube analysis on ...

The connection test only passes with Native configuration and fails with both Manual and Direct on Eclipse, even with proxy settings configured.p  pIs there a way to configure the analysis to run successfully using a server from across the firewallp

Negative 79778 pIm thinking in a free service that offers something like the ability of record and save podcasts, but the costs of storing all those files is making this idea impossible.p  pI was thinking in saving every user generated file in a storage service like the ones in the title and ask permission to the user to manage those drivesfolders. That way we wouldnt need a big storage quota, instead the service could be offered free, as we want.p  pIs this a good idea In terms of performance.p

Negative 79778 pIm perplexed as to how I am to free up memory in scene kit using swift.

Whenever it is removed from the parent node, zero ram frees up, and I do not understand why.  What code can I use to TRULY remove the object  I cant find any documentation on the subject.

Negative 79778 pIm moving my first steps with codetheanocode and I cannot figure out how to solve this problem which could be actually very easy. p  pI have a code3  4  2code tensor, like the followingp  precode[1 1]  [2 2]  [3 3] [1 1]  [2 2]  [3 3] [0 0]  [2 2]  [3 3] [9 9]  [0 0]  [3 3] codepre  pSo I have codeN3code sequences, each of them of length codeL4code with their elements that are vectors of dimension coded2code. Actually, the sequences can be of different length but I could think of padding them with code[0 0]code vectors, as shown above. p  pWhat I want to do is, first scan through the first axis of the tensor and sum up all the vector in the lists strongup to the the first [0 0] vectorstrong  thats why I added the [9 9] at the end of the first tensor slice, in order to check the sum exit condition [1]. I should end up in code[[2 2], [6 6], [12 12]]code.
