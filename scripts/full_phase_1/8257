Is it possible in Node.jsp  pUPDATED Here is a code to demonstrate the problemp  pCustom writable stream modulep  precodevar stream  requirestream var util  requireutil  function WritableObjects       stream.Writable.call         this,                      objectMode true                  util.inherits WritableObjects, stream.Writable   WritableObjects.prototype.write  function chunk, encoding, doneWriting       console.logwrite, chunk, encoding     doneWriting    module.exports       WritableObjects WritableObjects  codepre  pand database query codep  precodevar sw  new wstream.WritableObjects var request  new sql.Requestconnection request.stream  true request.pipesw request.querySELECT DataId, Data FROM ds.tData WHERE DataId in 1  sw.onerror, functionerr      console.logStream err  , err   sw.onpipe, functionsrc      console.logStream pipe    sw.onfinish, functiondata      console.logStream finish  codepre  pI this example codechunkcode parameter of codewritecode method contains the whole data of db record, not a stream.

Positive 8257 pSo in some method, I will be opening a new IO stream, doing some processing with it, and then using that stream as the input to open up another IO stream. I dont believe I can use a single trywithresources block because of the processing with the first IO stream being in between opening the first and second streams. So with that said, would it be better in a codingdesign sense to use a single trycatchfinally block to open and close these streams or use nested trywithresources blocks to open and close the streams I know that if there is no processing between the first and second IO streams, it would be best to open all three streams in a single trywithresources block.p  pA simplistic example followsp  pstrongTryCatchFinallystrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     SomeIOStream io1  null    SomeIOStream io2  null    SomeIOStream io3  null     try       io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing        io1.moreStreamProcessing       io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1        io3  new SomeIOStream is       do stuff with io2 and io3     catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing streams io3, io2, io1, is      codepre  pstrongTrywithresourcesstrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     try  SomeIOStream io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing         io1.moreStreamProcessing       try  SomeIOStream io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1              SomeIOStreeam io3  new SomeIOStream is              do stuff with io2 and io3            catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing stream is      codepre  pTo me, it looks as though the first is cleaner, but the second has the benefits of a trywithresources block.  Of course, stronganotherstrong alternative is to open the initial io1 with trywithresources, but open io2 and io3 within that tryblock. So would this third mixed approach be better than the above twop  pstrongMixed Approachstrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     SomeIOStream io1  null    SomeIOStream io2  null    SomeIOStream io3  null     try SomeIOStream io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing         io1.moreStreamProcessing       io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1        io3  new SomeIOStream is       do stuff with io2 and io3     catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing streams io3, io2, is      codepre  pAlso as an additional question, am I right to assume that the only way to close the InputStream codeiscode would be to put it in the finallyblockp

Negative 8257 pIm writing a reasonably complex web application. The Python backend runs an algorithm whose state depends on data stored in several interrelated database tables which does not change often, plus user specific data which does change often. The algorithms peruser state undergoes many small changes as a user works with the application. This algorithm is used often during each users work to make certain important decisions.p  pFor performance reasons, reinitializing the state on every request from the seminormalized database data quickly becomes nonfeasible. It would be highly preferable, for example, to cache the states Python object in some way so that it can simply be used andor updated whenever necessary. However, since this is a web application, there several processes serving requests, so using a global variable is out of the question.p  pIve tried serializing the relevant object via pickle and saving the serialized data to the DB, and am now experimenting with caching the serialized data via memcached. However, this still has the significant overhead of serializing and deserializing the object often.p  pIve looked at shared memory solutions but the only relevant thing Ive found is a hrefhttpposhmodule.sourceforge.net relnofollowPOSHa. However POSH doesnt seem to be widely used and I dont feel easy integrating such an experimental component into my application.p  pI need some advice This is my first shot at developing a web application, so Im hoping this is a common enough issue that there are wellknown solutions to such problems. At this point solutions which assume the Python backend is running on a single server would be sufficient, but extra points for solutions which scale to multiple servers as well p  pNotesp  ul liI have this application working, currently live and with active users.

Negative 8257 pAt a previous workplace we used svn externals to update dependent projects when a shared component was updated. This made it easy to see anything that those changes broke, as well as update dependent projects to the latest version of a shared component automatically without any intervention.p  pAt a new workplace we are using cc.net with surround scm and Im trying to find something similar in surround. I havent found anything like externals, only shared files, but unlike externals, the shared files doesnt allow you to point at a specific revision of a file for the external.p  pIm interested in what other people are doing in these scenarios to lean on their continuous integration and treat it more for integration than a continuous build server. Does anyone know of a tool or something to do externals behavior without using svnp  pI suppose having an xml registry file of which projects depend on which assemblies and if they should be using the latest version but this seems like overkill.p
Negative 8257 pHey all,           I am learning to be a dba, and the one thing i am missing is good quantity of data to handle a database with. Someone on irc said if you cant handle few terabytes of data then you are still not good enough. p  pMy question is, is there a way i can have terabytes of data from somewhere that i can use it for my learning purposes  I am going to use it in oracle.p  pI thought about collecting spam emails,but it would be a long shot to get large quantity of data in a short time. Should i go for this  I would be helpful if someone can recommend a better solution. I just need few terabytes of data to play with the database.p  pThanks.p

Negative 8257 pIm trying to get remote debugging working again on a Windows 2003 server that I use for ASP.Net 2.0 development.  I had everything up and running for months then one day, I was forced by our AD policy to change my password and the remote debugging has not worked since.p  pI have a Windows 2003 server running virtually MS Virtual PC 2007 on the same system that I run my Visual Studio 2005 IDE from Windows XP Pro.  Both systems are members of the same domain and my domain account is in the admin group of both systems.  Im logged into the XP machine running Visual Studio and the Windows server running the Debug Console using this domain account. p  pWhen I try to attach to the remote debugger from within VS I get an error after about 1 minute Unable to connect to the Microsoft Visual Studio Remote Debugging Monitor and myServer.  This operation returned because the timeout period expired.  p  pWhen attaching from VS, I have used just the server name as well as the full debug server instance name DomainusermyServer that is listed in the console but I get the same results.  I have also tried running the console as a service using my domain account this is the original way I had it setup and from a share on the XP PC running VS.again same results.  I also checked the permissions on the Debug Console and both the admin group as well as my domain account are listed and Debug is set to Allow for both.p  pWhen I try to attach to the debugger from within VS I can see the connection popup on the Remote Debug Console of the server and it says its connected but I noticed that its trying to connect as a different user than what Im logged into either machine as.  The debug console shows the connection belongs to a local account myServeruser1 I would expect to see DomainUser.  The local account that shows in the debug console does exist locally on both systems and is in the local admin group on each system but I have no idea why it would all of a sudden try to use that account rather than the domain account Im logged in as on both systems.p  pAs I mentioned, everything was working for months and only seem to stop functioning after the AD account password was changed.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this issuep  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

There were not subprocceses running, there are still records to be updated, and the script had not exited.

Negative 8257 pThe frequency with which I am coming across the situation where I have to call native 32bit code from a managed 64bit process is increasing as 64bit machines and applications become prevalent.  I dont want to mark my applciation as 32bit and I cannot obtain 64bit versions of of the code that is being calling.p  pThe solution that I currently use is to create C COM shims that are loaded out of process to make the 32bit calls from the 64bit process.p  pThis COM shim solution works well and the cross process calls are handled behind the scenes by COM, which minimises the overhead of this approach.p  pI would however like to keep all the new development that we undertake using C and wondered if there are any frameworks that minimise the overhead of doing this.

Negative 8257 pI want a simple, interactive way to demo middletier features of my app which have not had a UI created yet.  I want an interactive console.p  pWhen my application WPF but it shouldnt matter boots up I would like to also start a console window.  This window should run powershell or ruby, or python, but preferably powershell and have its scope set to access my ServiceLocator.p  pAlternately, I could start up my app and attach to the process appdomain from an external powershell window and grab a reference to the ServiceLocator.  Is this even possiblep  pAnyways, Ive created IronRuby engines and set variables in scopes before but if I went that route I would need to essentially create my own console inputdisplay mechanism.  p  pDoes anyone know of a better way to go about thisp
Negative 8257 pIm looking into building a largescale J2EE application that really doesnt have much more functionality than storingretrieving data and then formatting it either to the user interface, a predefined form, or to XML based webservices.  There might evolve into a need for relatively complex relationships in the future though.p  pSo my question is, bearing in mind that my biggest concerns right now are lowcost its a startup, scalability its a cloud app, integrity of data data corruptions would be very very bad, moreso than usual in this case, and security information needs to be kept confidential, what are some good starting databases to usep  pIve looked into PostgreSQL and it seems to have come a long way but Im being tempted away by DB2 ExpressC and a few other free commercial versions.  Id prefer to stay away from Microsoft SQL Server because of its lack of multiplatform support albeit I will admit its a pretty good database.p  pDoes anyone have any experience along these linesp
Negative 8257 pIm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but here goes...p  pstrongShort versionstrong Im trying to compute the orientation of a triangle on a plane, formed by the intersection of 3 edges, without explicitly computing the intersection points.p  pstrongLong versionstrong I need to triangulate a PSLG on a triangle in 3D. The vertices of the PSLG are defined by the intersections of line segments with the plane through the triangle, and are guaranteed to lie within the triangle. Assuming I had the intersection points, I could project to 2D and use a pointlineside or triangle signed area test to determine the orientation of a triangle between any 3 intersection points.p  pThe problem is I cant explicitly compute the intersection points because of the floatingpoint error that accumulates when I find the lineplane intersection. To figure out if the line segments strike the triangle in the first place, Im using some freely available robust geometric predicates, which give the sign of the volume of a tetrahedron, or equivalently which side of a plane a point lies on. I can determine if the line segment endpoints are on opposite sides of the plane through the triangle, then form tetrahedra between the line segment and each edge of the triangle to determine whether the intersection point lies within the triangle.p  pSince I cant explicitly compute the intersection points, Im wondering if there is a way to express the same 2D orient calculation in 3D using only the original points. If there are 3 edges striking the triangle that gives me 9 points in total to play with. Assuming what Im asking is even possible using only the 3D orient tests, then Im guessing that Ill need to form some subset of all the possible tetrahedra between those 9 points. Im having difficultly even visualizing this, let alone distilling it into a formula or code. I cant even google this because I dont know what the industry standard terminology might be for this type of problem.p  pAny ideas how to proceed with this  Thanks.  Perhaps I should ask MathOverflow as well...p  pEDIT After reading some of the comments, one thing that occurs to me... Perhaps if I could fit nonoverlapping tetrahedra between the 3 line segments, then the orientation of any one of those that crossed the plane would be the answer Im looking for. Other than when the edges enclose a simple triangular prism, Im not sure this subproblem is solvable either. p  pEDIT The requested image. img srchttpimgur.comJkwWg.jpg altalt textp
Negative 8257 pI work for a medical lab company. They need to be able to search through all their client data. So far they have a few years in storage about 4 million pieces of paper, and they are adding 10,000 pages per day. For data that is 6 months old, they need to access it about 1020 times per day. They are deciding whether to spend 80k on a scanning system, and have the secretaries scan everything in house, or whether to hire a company like iron mountain to do this. Iron mountain will charge around 8cents per page, which adds up to around 300k for the amount of paper we have, plus a bunch of more money every day for the 10,000 sheets.p  pI am thinking that perhaps I can build a database and do all the scanning in house. p  ol liWhat are those systems that are used to scan checks and mail and they read really messy hand writing really wellli lihas anyone had experience building a database with a bunch of OCRd searchable documents What tools should I use for my problemli liCan you recommend the best OCR librariesli liAs a programmer, what would you do to solve this problemli ol  pFYI none of the answers below answer my questions well enoughp
Negative 8257 pCurrently, weve got an application that needs to perform very fast searches on 2 mill records.p  pSearches need to search both a large freetext field, and a number of integerdecimal fields between different ranges, along with various functionscomputations amp sorting.p  pCurrently, were handling this with a big MSSQL database, using the builtin freetext engine, and some replication to move the load off the transactional tables.p  pHowever  as you may have guessed, this solution isnt the most scalable.p  pIve written up a little Lucenebased document store, and am generally quite impressed by the results, with text searches not taking much longer than a 12 a second on 100k records.p  pThe hard part is the parametric searching  Im aware Lucene does basic range matching  however I feel we need something more powerful.p  pIve made a little test database using db4o  which has powerful query capabilities, however these queries are quite slow  taking over 15sec on only 100k records  wherein SQL takes about 1.5 seconds for the freetext amp parametric searches.p  pAlso, our database needs to have an update resolution of less than 10min, with approx 15 of the records changing on a daily basis. Our SQL server is handling this currently, but starting to creak.p  pAny guidance on suitable technologies amp approaches would be appreciated.p  pCheers, Davep

Negative 8257 pWhat is the best way to parse a large floating point file stored in ASCIIp  pWhat would be the fastest way to do it I remember someone telling me using ifstream was bad, because it worked on a small number of bytes, and it would be better to just read the file into memory first. Is that true p  pEdit I am running on Windows, and the file format is for a point cloud that is stored in rows like x y z r g b. I am attempting to read them into arrays. Also, the files are around 20nbspMB each, but I have around 10nbspGB worth of them.p  pSecond edit I am going to have to load the files to display every time I want to do a visualization, so it would be nice to have it as fast as possible, but honestly, if codeifstreamcode preforms reasonably, I wouldnt mind sticking with readable code. Its running quite slow right now, but that might be more of a hardware IO limitation than anything I can do in software, I just wanted to confirm.p
Negative 8257 pIm currently working on an SSIS package to load mainframe logs from multiple serverfile sources into a database.p  pAs it stands at the moment Im using a foreach loop container to loop through a recordset containing filenames and load the files using a codeData Flowcode task from a codeFlat File Sourcecode and codeFilecode connection to an codeOLE DB Destinationcode through a Derived column.p  pIve built in error handling on the codeData Flowcode task to allow for the fact that there wont always be a log file in the location specified ie. because the server was down for maintenance during a specific period as the files are generated on an hourly basis, but the problems start after it finishes handling these errors.p  pIf the file immediately following an attempt to load a file that wasnt found exists it begins to load it but then throws the following warning message code[Message Log File Source NORDXSL [57]] Warning There is a partial row at the end of the file.code, and doesnt load all of the records in that file.p  pHowever, when I remove the files I know wont exist from the recordset so that it only attempts to load files that do exist, including the one with the alleged partial row, everything works fine and all filesrows are loaded without a problem. It just seems to not want to load the first file after its failed a missing file correctly and I cant for the life of me work out whyp  pIve tried calling codeDisposecode and codeReleaseConnectioncode on the file connection after the codeData Flowcode task has finished processing but this makes no difference and Im now completely out of ideas.p  pAny help would be really appreciated as this is the last bug in this project and I want to get it out the door.

Negative 8257 pI am trying to develop an object oriented representation of a finite element model. The finite element model consists of some output filesoutputs of a commercial Finite element program in binary format which keep certain data related to the finite element model for people who are not in the field, these data correspond to nodes of the model coordinates of the nodes, elements of the model, element connectivity for the element representationswhich elements are associated with which nodes and element matrix information. These data could also be represented generally as some vectors of ints and double and some other array structure if you call so. p  pI was thinking of making a general class FeModel and associating the above mentioned files as members of this class and work this way, of course these files would also be objects representing these files. However, the files that keep the information are not a part of the FeModel class that I was thinking on, at least conceptually. Since the idea does not relate to the real world representation, I thought that there should be a better way. Those files are just there to keep the information. p  pI am now thinking on the option of just reading the necessary information from these files in the FeModel class by creating suitable member functions and build what I want this way so that the interface is more or less a minimal one. However, on the other hand dividing this task into different classes representing the above mentioned files and using those as members in the FeModel class does not look also like a bad option to me. What are the decision criteria in these situations I am aware of the fact that a problem could be solved in many different ways but are there some sort of guidelines to follow in similar kinds of cases where one hesitates between some options p  pGreetz, U.p

Negative 8257 pI have a history of hating Java, having used it pretty regularly in the late 90s during the slow as balls era. As such, I never really learned it well. From what I understand, Java is actually a pretty good language to use these days. Ive been thinking about diving into it because of Jython and Clojure. That is to say, Id like to program in Java and use inline Jython or Clojure where appropriate. But truthfully, Ill probably just be programming in JythonjRuby and calling up clojure from there. p  pWhich brings me to my question. I know both of these languages can be called from Java, but is that necessarily good practice Should I even bother learning java if I just want to use Jython as the primary language Seeing as how thats a large part of my motivations here, Id like to know that Im not terribly misguided before jumping in. Im aware there is a very high risk for projects to become a kludge if done in multiple languages like this.p  pIm still learning about the JVM and the like, so I apologize if this question is painfully obvious.p
Negative 8257 pI have a codeDataGridcode with rows representing a host Im doing pings to and a column called codeLostcode which represents lost ICMP packets which over time increases in value. I have the whole codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode thing down and Im seeing value increase. What I want to do is write a codeStylecode thatll change a rows background color from white to dark red progressively relative to the codeLostcode columns value.p  pI would like, if it were possible, to write a codeTriggercode or codeDataTriggercode with a setter value set to a codeValueConvertercode which would calculate the color needed, but so far Ive been unsuccessful in writing a style that will update every time a Lost cells value changes. I only see a difference in color when I load a new data context and switch back just for testing.p  pHeres what Ive triedp  precode    ltStyle xKeyDownStyle TargetTypexType DataGridRowgt         ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueBinding ConverterStaticResource BackgroundConverter gt     ltStylegt codepre  pI cant see this working with a codeDataTriggercode since you have to specify a value anyways and the values are infinite or Int32.MaxValue I guess, really. Although I also tried specifying a codeValueConvertercode for the value property and that didnt work either.p  pBtw, I want to try to avoid codebehind if possible.p  pstrongEditstrong Rick I had tried doing something likep  precode    ltStyle xKeyDownStyle TargetTypexType DataGridRowgt         ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding ConverterStaticResource LostColumnValueConverter ValueSomenumbergt                 ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueBinding ConverterStaticResource BackgroundConverter gt             ltDataTriggergt         ltStyle.Triggersgt     ltStylegt codepre  pI think I understand the need to have the codeTriggercode actually bind to something thats going to be changing in this case I feel Im forced to also use a codeValueConvertercode to get the columns value, is there a more direct way, but even if I do this, what do I specify as the codeDataTriggercodes valuep  pstrongEditstrong So in my case I went ahead and did the following currently this would only modify the codeTextBlockcodes backgroundp  precodeltDataGridTemplateColumn HeaderLost WidthAutogt     ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt             ltTextBlock TextBinding Lost, NotifyOnTargetUpdatedTruegt                 ltTextBlock.Triggersgt                     ltEventTrigger RoutedEventBinding.TargetUpdatedgt                         ltBeginStoryboardgt                             ltStoryboardgt                                 ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Duration0 Storyboard.TargetPropertyBackgroundgt                                     ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime0 ValueBinding ConverterStaticResource BackgroundConverter gt                                 ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                             ltStoryboardgt                         ltBeginStoryboardgt                     ltEventTriggergt                 ltTextBlock.Triggersgt             ltTextBlockgt         ltDataTemplategt     ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt ltDataGridTemplateColumngt codepre  pWhich to me seems right, but only works once for some reason. I added a seperate codeTargetUpdatedcode event handler right on the codeTextBlockcode definition to see if the event was indeed being called on every change and it is. Something must be missing on my codeEventTriggercode. Probably something to do with the codeStoryboardcode. Anyways, this all seems incredibly verbose for something so simple, so I went ahead and went with the codebehind route.p

Negative 8257 pI have a form that submits to a script which can take a long time to execute 3060 seconds, give or take.

Negative 8257 pIve built a Javascriptheavy web app and recently tweaked it to work on iPad it needed tweaks because it allows drawing by moving the mouse around, and onmousedownonmousemove would not get triggered until finger release.p  pNow, with the tweaks, the app runs fine on Mobile Safari. Im seeing a problem, however, where the first time I try to load the app on the iPad, it often crashes Mobile Safari. However, reopening the browser and refreshing the page loads the app perfectly and its fully usable. After doing some research I found out that the most common cause for Mobile Safari crash is over 6MB of pictures or multiple pictures loaded through Javascript. My app only uses images for icons, so the total image size is actually very small probably under 100KB total, my JS code, however, is 2.5MB uncompressed and 350KB compressed using gz which is how Im sending it to the client.p  pIve also read that loading images through CSS can avoid crashes due to the image size limit. I figured it was worth a try since its also possible the crash is due to large number of images, not just total image size. After changing some of my icons to be rendered using CSS backgroundimage property, the crash seemed to have gone. I decided to go a step further and tweak all other icons to render using CSS backgrounds as well. After changing all of my images to be rendered using CSS, all of a sudden the crash seems to be back.p  pWhich leads me to several possible conclusionsp  pA. Even the partial CSS fix I made did not actually help but somehow I got extremely lucky and saw no crash while reloading my app and restarting the iPad multiple times then the crash is likely somewhere with my JS code or other parts of the pagep  pB. I introduced some other issue when changing the rest of my icons to load through css if thats the case, I wouldnt expect reloading the page to fix the issue, but it doesp  pC. The crash is due to something in my Javascript unrelated to images but then why does it load and work correctly after reloadp  pD. iPad chokes when trying to renderuncompress that much Javascript at once I havent heard of this being an issue, but its also rare to see a chunk of Javascript this bigp  pDoes anyone know what other issues aside from 6MB image limit can cause Mobile Safari to crash the first time a page is loaded, but not the secondp  pIf it helps, here is the link to my web app this is the old version that loads images through JS a hrefhttpwww.grafpad.comgrafpadcanvasdemo relnofollowhttpwww.grafpad.comgrafpadcanvasdemoa its written in Pyjamas, which is why there is so much generated Javascript.p  pThanksp

Negative 8257 pIm trying to extract Linear PCM data from a MP3 file. Before iOS 5, I could do it successfully using emAudioToolboxem framework, specifically emExtAudioFileReadem function. However, strongin iOS 5 the emExtAudioFileReadem function gives completely different result from that in iOS 4.strongp  pstrongFirst, it cannot read all the packets in the source MP3 file.strong For example, it reads only 1637 packets while the source MP3 file has 2212 packets in total.p  pstrongSecond, the PCM values obtained from the function are completely different from those obtained  in iOS 4.strongp  pI cant figure out what I did wrong  The same framework, the same function, and the same code... but completely different results I doubt it is a bug of iOS 5 so I reported the problem to Apple already. But Apple has not answer to my bug reporting for 2 weeksp  pHeres the code that causes the problem. After executing the code, I expect to have the correct PCM data in empcmBufferem.

Negative 8257 pIve seen this several times in blog posts and apple sample projects. Where all the NIB files are placed somewhere in the resources directory. p  pIt doesnt make that much sense to me. Usually when I use nibs which is rare they are closely tied to a specific UIViewController which would be located in the Classes directory. p  pSo I usually group each nib with its corresponding viewcontrollers .h and .m files. p  pThe only case I could see for putting a Nib in the resources directory is that if it were a reusable resource that gets accessed by multiple view controllers. Though that always seemed like way more trouble than it was worth.p  pCan someone explain the rational herep
Negative 8257 pA terminological question  is Greedy bestfirst search different from Bestfirst searchp  pThe a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBestfirstsearchwiki pagea has a separate paragraph about Greedy BFS but its a little unclear.p  pMy understanding is that Greedy BFS is just BFS where the best node from OPEN in wikipedias algorithm is a heuristic function one calculates for a node. So implementing thisp  precodeOPEN  [initial state] CLOSED  [] while OPEN is not empty do  1. Remove the best node from OPEN, call it n, add it to CLOSED.  2. If n is the goal state, backtrace path to n through recorded parents and return path.  3. Create ns successors.  4. For each successor do    a. If it is not in CLOSED evaluate it, add it to OPEN, and record its parent.    b. Otherwise change recorded parent if this new path is better than previous one. done codepre  pwith best node from OPEN being a heuristic function estimating how close the node is to the goal, is actually Greedy BFS. Am I rightp  pemEDITem Comment on Anonymouses answerp  pSo essentially a greedy BFS doesnt need an OPEN list and should base its decisions only on the current node Is this algorithm GBFSp  precode1. Set START as CURRENT node 2. Add CURRENT to Path [and optinally, to CLOSED] 3. If CURRENT is GOAL, exit 4. Evaluate CURRENTs successors 5. Set BEST successor as CURRENT and go to 2. codepre

Negative 8257 pIm writing an HTML5 mobile application, and using PhoneGap to push it to the iPad.  The application is similar to the Twitter application for iPad, in that it lists a bunch of items, lets users click on those items, and potentially loads an external link within the app.  Facebook does this as well with their applications.p  pWriting an application that loads external content in an HTML5 application has proven to be an awful experience to this point.  I can dump an IFRAME on the page, but that doesnt support scrolling on the iPad out of the box.  Ive done some hacky things to wire up iscroll4 to the iframe, but its wildly inconsistent.  Scripts can jump the iframe and try to break out.  Security errors are thrown.  You have to modify the PhoneGap source to allow external requests from the iframe.  I cant make any assumptions about meta viewport, because the source is external.  The list goes on...p  pI can fix a lot of these things with individual hack work arounds and dark magic, but this whole time Ive felt like there just has to be a better way.  Is there a component out there that works around all this stuff  Ive felt like a native wrapper for the browser inside of JavaScript would fix a lot of these issues, but cant seem to find anything like it  what is everyone else usingp  pemNote  I just discovered the browser phonegap plugins  Im guessing this will be a popular choice emp

If a name is used, you can usually trace back to exactly where that name was defined. But, Ive recently been running into modules wherein I want to find where the name codequxcode is defined. The module itself contains no codefrom something import code, no codelocalscode or codeglobalscode, but when I CTRLF for that name I find it only on the RHS of expressions, nowhere definedp  pSo my question is this what are all the mechanisms by which a name can enter the local namespace Can normal imports inject into my local namespace p
Negative 8257 pIm new to web2py and web application development in general and I have a certain use case in mind that Im not sure how to solve given the tools and knowledge that I currently have. p  pWhat I want to do is load a pickled class instance once and then keep reusing it for every request that comes into my web2py application. Is there a way to do that in a way that doesnt impact per request performance In other words is there a way to unpickle the data once and only once and keep reusing it for every requestp  pUnpickling the data in the model is not the right way to do it because the model is executed on every request and so this will reload the file every time. Similarly doing it in a module is also not the right thing because importing the module will execute the code in the module on every request. The only other thing I can think of is caching the data in ram but I would like to know if there is another way to do it.p

Negative 8257 pI am wondering what the best practice would be for the following project. I am going to use JQuery to make a draganddrop quiz feature. At the end of the quiz, when the submit button is pressed, I want to total the number of correct boxes dropped over correct answers. This means that not all boxes will have been dropped.p  pI was considering using Javascript classes to instantiate objects boxes, in this case and count up through all the objects that had a droppedTrue value set to true, for example. Or I guess I could somehow set a property in the javascript of each of the boxes probably divs so when the submit button was pressed it would go through all the boxes with a certain markerp  pI guess my question boils down to how do I set some type of marker for the divs that have actually been dropped on the correct boxesp
Negative 8257 pIll try to describe the problem Im having as specifically as I can. This is a question I already asked some time ago, but didnt get any reply. Im specifying because you will see some edits done in the past days. The old question has been deleted, heres the updated one.p  pFirst off, Id like to clarify that this only happens occasionally. Thats why Im having a very hard time trying to figure out whats going on.p  pI have coded an iPhone app, which is using an codeUITableViewcode to display a set of buttons and settings the user can touch to trigger some functions much like Settings.app. The problem with it is that sometimes whenever I scroll down and then back up, some of the cells that should be displayed on the bottom of the screen just completely disappear.p  pIt looks like the device decides they are off the screen and therefore stops displaying them deallocates them maybe.p  pAnother odd thing is that this never happened on the iPhone simulator, while it only happens on the actual device and randomly. When it happens, it happens as the program is started not at a later time and keeps happening until I close my app from the multitasking bar and start it again.p  pFor reference, heres my tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell static NSString SwitchCellIdentifier  SwitchCell UITableViewCell cell  nil  Two separate cell pools, one for normal cells, one for cells with switches if indexPath.section lt sectionSettings ampamp indexPath.row lt indexTestMode      cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierSwitchCellIdentifier]     if cell  nil              cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierSwitchCellIdentifier]         cell.selectionStyle  UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone         cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryNone          Adds switches         UISwitch aSwitch  [[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrameCGRectZero]         [aSwitch addTargetself actionselectorswitchChanged forControlEventsUIControlEventValueChanged]         cell.accessoryViewaSwitch       else      cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]     if cell  nil              cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]          cell.selectionStyle  UITableViewCellSelectionStyleBlue     cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryNone     cell.accessoryView  nil     cell.imageView.image  nil   Cell configuration cell.textLabel.font  [UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize[UIFont systemFontSize]] cell.textLabel.textAlignment  UITextAlignmentLeft  Sets sectionspecific styles switch indexPath.section      ... just some cell configuration text, images, styles etc.  return cell  codepre  pNone of the solutions suggested here on StackOverflow I spent a lot of time researching, really for similar issues have worked for me.p  pstrongAdditional infostrongp  ul liProject compiled with the iPhone 5.1 sdk, targeting iOS 4.0 and further.li liThe compiled binary is fat, as I have to include support to both armv6 and armv7 architectures.li liTHUMB support is off for armv6, while its on for armv7 as recommended by Apple. li liUsing automatic reference counting.li liThe app is for jailbroken devices only, as it needs to run out of the sandbox.

And, heres another updatep  pThe project is using other two tableViews, and they both never had this issue. The main differences between the one having the issue and the two that dont suffer it arep  ul liThe bugged one has multiple sections, while the other two only have one.li liThe bugged one doesnt have an actual data source an array or dictionary or anything else, labels are hard coded in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method. The other two are using arrays to store the data they show to the user.li liThe cellForRowAtIndexPath method is much more complex due to the additional cell configuration, mostly cosmetic adjustments on the bugged one than on the other ones.li ul  pToday I tried using a data source an array containing all of the required strings to display for the bugged one, but the problem happened again after a couple of restarts, so that is not the culprit. I realize that could have hardly been the cause, but Im just trying anything that comes to my mind.p  pAgain, any kind of help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8257 pFull Edit Right, I get the feeling that what I see to be obvious is not to someone not working on this project so this may annoy some people but Im gonna reset the details here.p  pOriginally  I had a series of text files, image files and sound files that sat in my Eclipse IDE workspace. Whilst I ran the application from the IDE, everything was shiny. The text based files .DAT in this instance are being loaded use the File and Scanner classes see below and the images and Sound are being loaded by slick2d see belowp  precode Loading a text based file from the IDE workspace Scanner scanner  new Scannernew Filetextintro1.DAT   Loading an image and a sound as handled by slick2d Image background  new ImageimagesbackgroundsmenuBG.jpg Sound bgm  new SoundsoundsmusicMainMenuTheme.wav codepre  pSo far everything works, however...p  pExporting When I exported the file to a runnable jar, none of the text, sounds and images were exported along with it. I did some research and learned that if things where contained within the lib folder of the library would be exported. This had two effectsp  ul liThis broke ALL the links in the IDE. Seeing as everything now existed in .lib... liHOWEVER, as the contents of lib are exported directly to the top level of the jar at least when I do so with Eclipse and JarSplice as I am doing this ifixedi the difference. At least before the problem I am trying to solve. ul  pThe Problem Looking at the code above, the text folder and the sounds folder exist at exactly the same level in the resulting exported jar. That and the path string has NOT been changed since the IDE where they both worked. Now, after being exported to a runnable jar ALL the sounds and image files are successfully loaded by slick2d but ALL of the text based .DAT files are now resulting in FileNotFound Exceptions at run time, even though the access for them has NOT been changed.p  pObviously, there is not something wrong with the path in the direct sense as the images and sounds are still being loaded but the error still persists.p  pI am accessing the file in a wrong manner Is there some sort of conflict between how slick2d manages itself and trying to access the files in the way I havep  pHope this is a little clearer.p

Its also been a hrefhttpwww.spoj.plproblemsCODESPTCported to SPOJa.p  pHeres the problem statementp  blockquote   pHere is an algorithm for shuffling N cardsp      p1 The cards are divided into K equal piles. p      p2 The bottom N  K cards   belong to pile 1 in the same order so the bottom card of the initial   pile is the bottom card of pile 1. p      p3 The next N  K cards from the   bottom belong to pile 2, and so on. p      p4 Now the top card of the shuffled pile is the top card of pile 1.    The next card is the top card of pile 2, ..., the Kth card of the shuffled pile is the top  card of pile K. Then K  1th card is the card which is now at the top of   pile 1, the K  2nd is the card which is now at the top of pile 2   and so on.p      pFor example, if N  6 and K  3, the order of a deck of cards ABCDEF   top to bottom when shuffled once would change to ECAFDB.p      pGiven N and K, what is the least number of shuffles needed after which   the pile is restored to its original orderp      pInput The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next T   lines contain two integers each N and K.p      pOutput Output T lines, one for each test case containing the minimum   number of shuffles needed. If the deck never comes back to its   original order, output 1.p      pConstraintsp      ul   liK will be a factor of N. li   liT lt 10000 li   listrong2 lt K lt N lt 109strongli   ul blockquote  hr  h1Spoiler Alert  dont read below if you want to solve it yourself.h1  pThe problem can be translated asp  blockquote   pstrongFind the number of times a Kway perfect a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInshuffleinshufflea needs to be performed   to restore a deck of N cards to its initial ordering.strongp blockquote  pI took two approaches to solving this problem.

The problem with this is that it exceeds the maximum time, so I started to look for a formula that would allow me to get the number in near constant time.p  pThe most I could optimize here e.g. used some maps for caching computed values in the same permutation cycle etc. was to make it pass 310 tests on interviewstreet.p  hr  pI found a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1285133this implementationa, which assumes that the number of shuffles needed to return to the initial state is the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMultiplicativeordermultiplicative ordera of K relative to N  1.

This is strange, since Im pretty sure that the first algorithm is correct I assume that the second one should be as well.p  pThe wrong answer classification could come from a runtime error in the code, but nothing jumps out as a possible cause for this.p  pI did not take into account the case in which no number shuffles can return the deck to the initial state  my understanding is that this is not possible. A finite number of perfect shuffles will eventually restore the initial ordering, even though the number of shuffles may be really high.p  pIf you took the time to read this, thanks.

Negative 8257 pI  have a different Http serverServerB planned for uploading the files, but figuring out what i need to  run and how i should program it to make it available for my main web applicationServer A to upload and download files. So that in case if we move to cluster environment, we can still point the same attachment server for uploading imagesfiles etc And we are not burndening the main server if we are uploading plently of files each hour. So Server B is dedicated for upload and downloading attachment via ServerA. Our main application is build mostly on primefaces and JSF. I believe if we are using plain html, in the form we can define the action argument to different server, how to do the same in JSF. As of now we dont want to use third party CDN, we want to find alternate solution where we can host ourself in a seperate server. Any suggestion  or point me to the url where i can get more information. p

Can these domain errors be caught in a portable and threadsafe wayp  pNote I am aware that Boost probably offers a solution via its codeboostnumericsconverterltgtcode template, but due to its high complexity and verbosity, and I have not been able to extract the essentials from it, and therefore I have not been able to check whether their solution makes assumptions beyond C03.p  pThe following naive approach fails due to the fact that the result of codeIfcode is undefined by C03 when the integral part of codefcode is not a representable value of codeIcode.p  precodetemplateltclass I, class Fgt I closestintF f    return If  codepre  pConsider then the following approachp  precodetemplateltclass I, class Fgt I closestintF f    if f lt stdnumericlimitsltIgtmin return stdnumericlimitsltIgtmin   if stdnumericlimitsltIgtmax lt f return stdnumericlimitsltIgtmax   return If  codepre  pThis also fails because the integral parts of codeFstdnumericlimitsltIgtmincode and codeFstdnumericlimitsltIgtmaxcode may still not be representable in codeIcode.p  pFinally consider this third approach which also failsp  precodetemplateltclass I, class Fgt I closestintF f    if f lt stdnumericlimitsltIgtmin return stdnumericlimitsltIgtmin   if stdnumericlimitsltIgtmax lt f return stdnumericlimitsltIgtmax   return If  codepre  pThis time codeIfcode will always have a welldefined result, however, since codeFstdnumericlimitsltIgtmaxcode may be much smaller than codestdnumericlimitsltIgtmaxcode, it is possible that we will return codestdnumericlimitsltIgtmaxcode for a floatingpoint value that is multiple integer values below codestdnumericlimitsltIgtmaxcode.p  pNote that all the trouble arises because it is undefined whether the conversion codeFicode rounds up, or down to the closest representable floatingpoint value.p  pHere is the relevant section from C03 4.9 Floatingintegral conversionsp  blockquote   pAn rvalue of an integer type or of an enumeration type can be converted to an rvalue of a floating point   type. The result is exact if possible. Otherwise, it is an implementationdefined choice of either the next   lower or higher representable value.p blockquote

Negative 8257 pI have three applications running in three separate app pools. One of the applications is an administrative app that few people have privileged access to. One of the function the administrative app allows is creating downtime notices. So when a user goes into the administrative app and creates a downtime notice the other two apps are supposed to pick up on there being a new notice and display it on the login page.p  pThe problem is that these notices are cached and being that each app is in a separate app pool the administrative app doesnt have any way to clear the downtime notices cache in the other two applications.p  pIm trying to figure out a way around this. The only thing I can think of is to insert a record in the DB that denotes the cache needs to be cleared and the other two apps will check the DB when loading the login page.

Negative 8257 pId like to have logged in users access to certain directories only. For example, have the following directory structurep  blockquote   pstuffuserapic.jpgp      pstuffuserbfile.docp blockquote  pId like Apache to only give usera access to codestuffuseracode and give a 403 if he tries to reach codestuffuserbcodep  pNow, Ive been reading and it seems to be possible to do this with REMOTEUSER and modrewrite. Which will make it even better, as i could rewrite it as codestuff gt stuffREMOTEUSERcodep  pThe problem is, I dont want the ugly browser popup. My PHP application already has a login form and a session. From what Ive been reading, it is possible to use basic HTTP authentication as an auth method for PHP to login as a hrefhttpuserpassstackoverflow.com relnofollowhttpuserpassstackoverflow.coma. But the opposite passing a web form to the HTTP authentication doesnt seem to be possible. p  pI would also like to avoid using something as modxsendfile, as Id rather not use any proxy scripts to handle this, and let Apache take care of access.p

Negative 8257 pIm trying to put together simple Backbone app and Pusher. What I have is backbone collection of item models. An application can receive events from Pusher that some of those models were updated.p  pId like to decouple my code from Pusher so that Ive created appwide Notifier that extends backbone Events, receives pusher events and publishes Backbone events.p  pNow my question is how can I update my models in collection I was thinking about providing Notifier to Collection when created and bind to Notifiers event function that would check having event data which model was changed, search for such model in own collection, update it accordingly and publish change event so that views could react accordingly.p  pIs that a good way Searching for right model in collection may not be very efficient, so I was also thinking on providing Notifier to every model instance and let all models be notified on change and implement some condition that only one target model instance should react.p
Negative 8257 pSo, basically Im trying to make a datacenter cab diagram. We have an excel spreadsheet, but this is not easy to update, nor easily searchable. I have three tables in a MySQL DB the db is racks, the tables are cabinets, devices, amp datacenters  each row in each of the tables represents what it is. The cabinet table has a column that designates how tall it is in U some cabinets in some datacenters are taller than others. So, when the php draws a cabinet, it draws the cabinet in the respective height. So far, everything works in regards to grouping the datacenters and their containing cabinets and their respective heights. My issue is that I cant seem to populate more than one device per cabinet. This is the entire page, and the MySQL DB setup is below thatp  precodeltSCRIPT LANGUAGEJavaScript typetextjavascriptgt lt     function clickHandlere              var targetId, srcElement, targetElement         if window.event e  window.event          srcElement  e.srcElement e.srcElement e.target         if srcElement.className  Outline                          targetId  srcElement.id  d                 targetElement  document.getElementByIdtargetId              if targetElement.style.display  none                                          targetElement.style.display                           srcElement.src  imagesminus.gif                                   else                                      targetElement.style.display  none                     srcElement.src  imagesplus.gif                                    document.onclick  clickHandler gt ltSCRIPTgt ltnoscriptgtYou need Javascript enabled for this page to work correctlyltnoscriptgt lt function sqlconn      usernameroot     passwordroot     databaseracks     serverlocalhost      mysqlconnectserver,username,password or dielth2 aligncenter classredgt[ltimg srcimagescritical.gif border0gt] Unable to connect to server [ltimg srcimagescritical.gif border0gt]lth2gt     mysqlselectdbdatabase or dielth2 aligncenter classredgt[ltimg srcimagescritical.gif border0gt] Unable to select database as a database [ltimg srcimagescritical.gif border0gt]lth2gt   sqlconn sqldatacentersSELECT  FROM datacenters  sqldevicesSELECT  FROM devices resultdatacentersmysqlquerysqldatacenters resultdevicesmysqlquerysqldevices j0 echo lttable border1 stylefloatleftgt while datacenterssqlrowmysqlfetcharrayresultdatacenters      echo lttrgtlttdgt     echo lth2 classblack alignleftgt     echo ltIMG SRCimagesplus.gif IDOut . j .

Negative 8257 pI have two potential roads to take on the following problem, the try it and see methodology wont pay off for this solution as the load on the server is constantly in flux.  The two approaches I have are as follows  p  precodeselect    from              select foo.a,bar.b,baz.c         from foo,bar,baz        updated for clarity sake         where foo.ab.bar         and  b.barbaz.c        group by a,b,c codepre  pvice  p  precodecreate table results as select foo.a,bar.b,baz.c   from foo,bar,baz   where foo.ab.bar   and  b.barbaz.c     create index resultsspanning on resultsa,b,c    select  from results group by a,b,c codepre  pSo in case it isnt clear.  The top query performs the group by outright against the multitable select thus preventing me from using an index.  The second query allows me to create a new table that stores the results of the query, proceeding to create a spanning index, then finishing the group by query to utilize the index.  p  pWhat is the complexity difference of these two approaches, i.e. how do they scale and which is preferable in the case of large quantities of data.  Also, the main issue is the performance of the overall select so that is what I am attempting to fix here.p  pstrongCommentsstrongp  blockquote   pAre you really doing a CROSS JOIN on three tables Are those three   columns indexed in their own right How often do you want to run the   query which delivers the end resultp blockquote  p1 No.br 2 Yes, where clause omitted for the sake of discussion as this is clearly a super trivial examplebr 3 Doesnt matter.p  pstrong2nd Updatestrong  p  pThis is a temporary table as it is only valid for a brief moment in time, so yes this table will only be queried against one time.p

Negative 8257 pI want to share a very large object e.g. in orders of megabytes or even several gigabytes, between a set of machines. The object will be written once but may be read many times. Maybe a naive approach is to use a ceneteralized storage like a hrefhttpredis.ioredisa. However, it may become a single point of failure and too many requests may make a DOS attack on redis. Then, a distributed solution is much more promising. But, the main concern is replicating the structure to all machines. If the replication is done via a masterslave technique, then replication may result a huge traffic load on the master because the object is large. Therefore, a better solution is using a P2P strategy for replicating the object in order to decrease the network load on the master.p  pDoes any body know a solution for this problem Maybe some candidates arebr   a hrefhttpredis.ioRedisabr   a hrefhttpmemcached.orgMemcachedabr   a hrefhttpwww.projectvoldemort.comvoldemortVoldemortabr   a hrefhttpwww.hazelcast.comHazelcastabrp  pMy major concerns are Java interface, sharing big object, high availablity, and low network traffic for replication.p  pThanks beforehand.p

Negative 8257 pIm ideas for a paralleldistributed programming personal project. Im familiar with openMP, Intel Cilk, Java Concurrent and MPI and I kinda feel the need to start writing something big, but coming up with an interesting idea. Do you have anyp  pEDIT What I was thinking about but hesitated to tell you out of fear of being laughed at was implementing a debuggerapicall intercepter for MPI in Windows. I had problems debugging my previous projects since I cannot afford a dedicated debugger and thats how the idea was born. I read quite a lot of literature about intercepting api calls and how debuggers work and although I cannot claim a firm grasp on all involved concept, I have enough to identify some problems that might arise so what Id like to ask you guys is the followingp  ul lipIs is doable  Im not sure if its possible for one man with limited resources to pull off something more than a toy. My background Im a computer science student with experience in Java acquired at school, C and python more or less self thought. I recently got into parallel and distributed computing and I liked it so I managed to learn quite a lot about it. My knowledge in how operating systems work is rather feeble and the main concern about my ability to develop this projectpli lipIs if is doable. What is the best way to start I read a lot of articles and papers explaining debugging techniques but Im still not sure about whats the best way to proceed considering the fact that an MPI debugger should work on multiple processes, probably in multiple computers and have separate outputs for each one of them. What I thought about so far seems stupid.pli lipLearning how to do it. I have problems deciding what is good advice and what is badoutdated advice in what I read so far, so if you guys know any good documentationresources to start something like this I will be mighty grateful.pli ul

However, if that simplifies the problem as its the case with abstract types, I do not need to further extend already concrete classes.p

Negative 8257 pI have created a timeaware animation involving thousands of placemarks representing population estimates at a hrefhttpwww.catalinagis.orgfoxrecovery relnofollowhttpwww.catalinagis.orgfoxrecoveryap  pI want to know how to count the sum of the total number of placemarks in this case, points that are visible at a given point in time. . .something like a timebased query.p  pThe population estimate fluctuates yeartoyear, so some points only last for a brief time span before theyre extinguished others persist from the beginning of the time span until the end.  There are over 3,000 points, so I dont want to go back through the KML onebyone.p  pI was given yearly population estimates and then simulated dieoff and repopulation on a monthly time scale to make the animation seem more natural.  I created the KML some time ago and want to check myself to see if I did it correctly. . .and also display the count as the time slider is moved.p

Negative 8257 pIve come to a part in my code where I must generate a random number every time I press a button r in this case. When I press this button, I want it to generate a number between 0 and n 3 in this case, but I dont want it to generate a number it previously generated. So I do not want the same number to be generated twice in a row. So 2 then 2 is bad. 2 then 0 then 2 is OK however.p  pIve looked around on here for questions similar to mine but none of them have really helped. Everyone else is generating once with the exception of numbers in an array or something. Im constantly generating and I want to be able to detect the same number previous.p  pI am using the Random class, I have considered using the math.random class but that is between 0 and 1 so that isnt really too useful. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks Dp
Negative 8257 pPart of REST best practice is to make use of links in the responses to allow clients to navigate from one entity to another.p  pFor example if I had a customer object type which has child account.

Negative 8257 pI am creating a template that uses a CMS and I will be giving it to other people. The web template requires a couple databases that I created in phpMyAdmin. If someone else is going to be using this they need the same tables, so I was wondering if there is a file I can write that they can install or run on their server that will create the databases and tables Kind of like when you install Wordpress and it creates their tables for you. p
Negative 8257 pgaaah designing in ios gives me headache So please, help me out and maby explain to me how one should think trying to come up with the solution.p  pI havep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyz0OB.png altUITableView with its headerp  ul liAs you can see the UITextField has its frame being set in storyboard to be smaller than its actual content.li liEverything above the prototypecell is within a UIView that is set to be tableHeader programatically.li ul  pI want top  pPress the read more btn so that the UITextField get its actual size. No problem, I can do that with getting the contentSize programmatically. It works but it ofc overflows the tableHeaderp  pSo I thought, good.

Believe me, Ive tried them all. The only ones which are supposed to handle quite well this quite of tasks are from Videocharge emWatermark Masterem and emVideocharge Studioem. None of them could perform correctly the task. Maybe there was some way I could have achieved this by scripting with emAfter Effectsem or emSony Vegasem, I just didnt find any.p  pNow Im trying to find some way to achieve the same thing either by shell, unix scripting... I dont care. I just dont want to mount Ubuntu only for these tasks. Im not a programmer, but Im quite stuborn which sometimes leads me to neverending nights so I would appreciate some help or guidance from anyone keen and good enough on batch video processing or scripting.p  pRight now, the only useful paths Ive found drive me into either using strongmencodestrong or strongffmpegstrong through commands, but I am not able to perform the merge on batch. I dont care about the way to sort the videos out. But taking into consideration that the operation would be performed on hundreds or thousands of videos, it wouldnt be suitable to have them all in separate folders each accompanied by the unique intro clip.

Basically, the user would input an equation in a text box and it would show up beneath, all prettied up in LaTEX with mathjax.

Negative 8257 pI just noticed that Scala has macros, but I have never seen any code that uses them. They also seem quite different from C preprocessor macros and the like.

Negative 8257 pI have spent quite a bit of time researching this online. However, I cant manage to get my Asynctask to load SoundPool sounds in the background.

I have two issues. First, if I were to return codeplayList[][]code, then how could I get my main Activity to get the array I have researched to find that you can change the UI with codeonPostExecutecode, and I have seen some ways that I dont completely understand to return Strings, but not an codearray[][]code like mine. p  pMy other question is that once I have loaded the SoundPool sounds, then can another SoundPool read them Im not sure if the sounds are actually loaded into the SoundPool itself, or simply created into an integer that is readable when the codeplaycode method is called. If not, then it would seem that I would have to return both a SoundPool and an array for my code to work. If someone could give me some real code examples explaining this stuff, it would be greatly appreciated. p  pAs for my actual code in the codedoInBackgroundcode method, it only consists of the code shown in the first and third blocks above, and the creation of a SoundPool. Also, sorry if there is anything obvious that Im doing wrongnot getting here, because Im new to Java and this is my first question on StackOverflow. Please let me know if there is any other information you need to better answer this question.p

Negative 8257 pIm writing a program for which I want to print results to a file  column wise in a loop. The result is a timedependent array.

The other option is to append the values column wise ie,p  precodearrayT0   arrayT1   arrayT2 ....... codepre  pThe array is of the order of 100. I would like to know if it can be done as the second option as it would make things easier for me. Is it possible If so, howp  pEDIT Sorry for the lack of clarity and the late reply.p  pSo let me give an example. I have an array of 100 elements. But this array is modified after a set of calculations after a time step. So the 100 elements will change into something else. So the problem is how I get the output. So I want to print the changed array after each time step. One way of doing it is printing it in different files. But if possible, I would like to print all the outputs in a single file like a matrix. Each column of this matrix will be the changed array after each time step. So can I do that WITHOUT storing the array each time it is modified OR Can I print the array each time to the same file column wise I hope this helps.p

It starts off ok, but after about the 5th sql command to create a table it complains that my sqlite database file is locked.p  pIve heard that NFS fileshares are a bit buggy with sqlite...but does the universitys server match that description Ive combed my code and make sure that I close all prepared statements and database transactions appropriately.p  pDoes this sound like a problem on my end the universitys end platform dependence Ive been at this for hours trying to figure it out...p  pThanks for any helpp  pstrongEDIT Ill include some code to clarifystrongp  pThis works fine on my Mac.

Negative 8257 pI am trying to automate testing for my Android app using Maven and Robolectric. The problem that I have is that I wont be running the tests on my local machine and the Android SDK wont be installed on the machine running the tests. I have used the mavendependencyplugin to grab the sdk from our repository and unpacked it in the process resources phase, the problem is that this occurs after the need to access the files. When I try to use the apk packaging it never gets to the SDK download because it cant find the SDK. So my question is this Is it possible to trigger this download before anything else happens in the build If anybody has any light to shed on how to properly install the sdk at build time it would be much appreciated. Let me know if I can add any additional information.p

Negative 8257 pI have a web app. In this web app there are user accounts stored in db. Passwords are not stored, users authenticate to Windows AD via LDAP.p  pI need to develop Windows tray notification app displaying some events that are happening in the web app. This tray app run from the client windows machine is supposed to send a request to the web app identifying itself as the web app user and display notification if web app response would provide some data.p  ol liI know how to write this tray appli liI know how to handle and display the response from the web appli liMy concern is how to do the authentication in secure manner.li ol  pWhat I am thinking of is to verify on workstation level if user is logged in  authenticated into Active Directory. If it is true I would like to get the username and somehow securely inform my web that current user successfully logged in into AD and provide its username. Having that web app could send back response, if any is available for that particular user.p  pI am trying to avoid 1. Requesting user for a password on app start if he has successfully logged into the AD. 2. Storing the password in any version encrypted  hashed, etc on the local machine, because it could be insecure and the password can change in the meantime.p  pDo you have any idea how to achieve the above or have other suggestion I will appreciate any feedback, thanks.p

Negative 8257 pI have my own solution to import monthly sales data in my windows form application. When a user click on codeimportcode button, the program is actually running but it looks like its not responding. The process takes a long time about 5 minutes.p  pSo, Id like to implement a progress bar with status strip label to display as an user interface and let the users know how much the task is done. This is also my first time using a progress bar in my program. So, I read through some tutorials which show how to use it. Some people use progress bar with background worker and timer. p  pBut I dont understand where I should use the solution that I have. In background worker codeDoWorkcode event I dont want to fake it by abusing the progress bar like setting the progressBar.Maximum  100, progressBar.Value  0 and as long as the timer is ticking increasing the value by 5. The progress bar must report the actual progress while the program is running.p  pThe following is the solution I am using now to import the datap  precodeprivate void btnImportClickobject sender, EventArgs e              if lsbxBrowsedFiles.Items.Count  0                      ArrayList salesHeaderArr  new ArrayList             ArrayList salesDetailArr  new ArrayList              int i  0             while i lt browsedXmlFileList.Count                              if browsedXmlFileList[i].ToUpper.EndsWithSALESHEADER.XML                                      salesHeaderArr.AddbrowsedXmlFileList[i]                                  if browsedXmlFileList[i].ToUpper.EndsWithSALESDETAIL.XML                                      salesDetailArr.AddbrowsedXmlFileList[i]                                  i                           if selectedFileIsNotInDestinationFoldersalesHeaderArr, salesDetailArr  true                              i  0                 while i lt salesHeaderArr.Count                                      SalesHeader salesHeader  new SalesHeader                     string sourceFilePath  salesHeaderArr[i].ToString                     readXMLFilessourceFilePath, SALESHEADER                     SalesHeader salesCheck  SalesHeadersalesHeaderList[0]                     string checkOutletCode  salesCheck.OutletCode                     DateTime checkBusDate  salesCheck.BusinessDate.Value                     if SalesHeader.IsThisRowAlreadyImportedInSalesHeadercheckOutletCode, checkBusDate  false                                              salesHeader.ImportSalesHeadersalesHeaderList                         salesHeader.CreateImportDataLoggetDestinationFilePathsourceFilePath,                             DateTime.Now, salesHeaderList.Count, SALESHEADER                                          else                                              string errorDate  checkBusDate.ToStringdd MMMM, yyyy                         MessageBox.ShowSelected XML File with BusinessDate   errorDate   has been already imported.,                             ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard                         MessageBox.ShowPlease select a file which has not been imported,                             ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard                         return                                          MoveXMLFiletoDestinationFoldersourceFilePath                     i                                  i  0                 while i lt salesDetailArr.Count                                      SalesDetail salesDetail  new SalesDetail                     string sourceFilePath  salesDetailArr[i].ToString                     readXMLFilessourceFilePath, SALESDETAIL                     SalesDetail salesCheck  SalesDetailsalesDetailList[0]                     string checkOutletCode  salesCheck.OutletCode                     DateTime checkBusDate  salesCheck.BusinessDate.Value                     if SalesDetail.IsThisRowAlreadyImportedInSalesDetailcheckOutletCode, checkBusDate  false                                              salesDetail.ImportSalesDetailsalesDetailList                         salesDetail.GenerateCarryForwardsalesDetailList                         salesDetail.CalculateImportInventoryBalancesalesDetailList                         salesDetail.CreateImportDataLoggetDestinationFilePathsourceFilePath, DateTime.Now, salesDetailList.Count, SALESDETAIL                                          else                                              string errorDate  checkBusDate.ToStringdd MMMM, yyyy                         MessageBox.ShowSelected XML File with BusinessDate   errorDate   has been already imported.,                             ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard                         MessageBox.ShowPlease select a file which has not been imported,                             ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard                         return                                          MoveXMLFiletoDestinationFoldersourceFilePath                     i                                  MessageBox.ShowImport has been successfully completed,                 ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard                 clearListBoxItems                 lblMessage.Visible  false                          Abort the import operation here             else                              MessageBox.ShowPlease select a file which has not been imported,                 ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard                 clearListBoxItems                 lblMessage.Visible  false                               else                      MessageBox.ShowPlease select XML files to import,                  ABC Cafe Import Sales Wizard               codepre  pAny help will be very much appreciatedp

Negative 8257 pI am working on the monthly Billing system for students for which they pay through their id card. We have done all the things MySQL databases and Client UI program and all. p  pBut we need a way to ensure that one person who knows the password to the MySQL server does not have unlimited control over it as that the team working on it is made up of students only. p  pSo I wanted to know if there is anything we can do to have MySQL ask for two passwords while connecting to it. It asks for one currently. We want like the thing that is there in Bank lockers, where bank has one key we have one key and both the keys are required to open the locker.p  pThanks in advance.p

It gets even more complex when Im wanting to do fairly deep document linking utilising Mongooses codepopulatecode functionality.p  pI know theoretically you can literally do away with the codeObjectIDcode and store the codeslugcode directly inside the id field, but you cannot update the codeidcode field once its been inserted, and also you would need to update all related links to the document if it did indeed change.p  pTo me, this seems like quite a common need, an REST compliant endpoint with codeslugcode based identifiers.p  pHas anybody had to build something like this before Any best practices on thisp  pThanksp

Negative 8257 pThe previous programmer used EXTJS, with which I dont have a whole lot of familiarity with.p  pThe application I am trying to fix has a modal called ADD ACCOUNT, with which a user can either manually type the various input fields or drag and drop an account already open into the modal.p  pThe user can hit a reset button and clear the fields.  However, if they dont clear the fields and they just close the window, when the window is reopened, the previous data is still there.p  pBasically, if the user decides to close the window, it needs to also reset and clear all the fields.p  pAs stated, I am not too familiar with EXTJS.  With that said, I will include the code below, which may be a lot.  I will try not to include unnecessary code.p  pThere are 2 files  accountGrid.php and accountGrid.jsp  pI have isolated where I think the issue begins in accountGrid.js.

It bounces once off of the side and then when it encounters a second wall, it just goes off into the abyss.p  pHere is a snippet of code used to write itp  precodevoid moveTheBox       while inside  true           if bigBoxX lt 0  bigBoxY lt 0                   bigBoxX gt 600  bigBoxSize                   bigBoxY gt 600  bigBoxSize               bigBoxDeltaX  bigBoxDeltaX  1             bigBoxDeltaY  bigBoxDeltaY  1              while bigBoxX gt 0  bigBoxY gt 0                       bigBoxX lt 600  bigBoxSize                       bigBoxY lt 600  bigBoxSize                   bigBoxX  bigBoxX  bigBoxDeltaX                 bigBoxY  bigBoxY  bigBoxDeltaY                  repaint                 pause                        else               bigBoxX  bigBoxX  bigBoxDeltaX             bigBoxY  bigBoxY  bigBoxDeltaY              repaint             pause                codepre  pEdit I figured out 4 minutes after you posted that.

Negative 8257 pstrongThe appstrongp  pSo Im developing a chat app using GCM. The app works as follow In a list of users, I can choose with which one I want to talk. Then a request is sent to this user and he has to accept it in order to start the chat. Its like the first user opens a chat room and wait for the other o join in. Im doing all this communication using special flags through GCM messages. Note that a user only exchanges messages inside a chat room. Theres no notification for him if he is outside a chat room.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWhen a user leaves the chat room I make him send through onDestroy a message through GCM to tell the other user that he is disconecting and therefore the other user wont be able to send him messages anymore. But what if this first user leaves the chat room without calling onDestroy Like closing the app, the app crashes, internet goes down, etc...p  pstrongSolution so farstrongp  pWhen the user sends or receives a message  I update his codelastseencode attribute on my database so I can know more or less if he is still online. So I have a cron job on my server checking from x to x seconds if the users of an active conversation are online and closing it if one of them are not. Note that the proccess of updating the user lastseen attribute is really heavy since I have to make an HttpRequest everytime I receive a GCM message when sending I already have to make an HTTPRequest, so its not a big problem and thats why I dont like this solution...p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pAny ideas on how to know if the user is not there anymorep  pThanks in advance, any ideas are welcomep

Negative 8257 pIm working on a jQuery code that is supposed to display tooltips codeltpgtcode when the corresponding link codeltagtcode is hovered. For that I use the codenextcode function to find the tooltip which is always placed right after the respective link.br Surprisingly, codenextcode returns no elements when the link and the tooltip element are inside a codeltpgtcode element. However, when I put those two in a codeltdivgtcode, it works fine  the next element is found.br I have created an entry on jsfiddle.net to help explain my problembr a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzwEAZ relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzwEAZabr The codeconsole.logcode line in the code always logs 0 when hovering the second link.br Im curious why its behaving like that.

Negative 8257 pIve been having a bit of trouble getting Nginx to play nicely with the Python Flasksocketio library which is based on gevent.  Currently, since were actively developing, Im trying to get Nginx to just work as a proxy.  For sending pages, I can get this to work, either by directly running the flasksocketio app, or by running through gunicorn.  One hitch the websocket messaging does not seem to work.  The pages are successfully hosted and displayed.  However, when I try to use the websockets, they do not work.  They are alive enough that the websocket thinks it is connected, but they will not send a message.  If I remove the Nginx proxy, they do work.  Firefox gives me this error when I try to send a messagep  blockquote   pFirefox cant establish a connection to the server at wssocket.io1websocket.p blockquote  pWhere web address is where the server is located and the unique id is just a bunch of randomish digits.  It seems to be doing enough to keep the connection live e.g., the client thinks it is connected, but cant send a message over the websocket.  I have to think that the issue has to do with some part of the proxy, but am having mighty trouble debugging what the issue might be in part because this is my first goround with both FlasksocketIO and nginx.  The configuration file I am using for nginx isp  precodeuser       ltuser namegt   This is set to the user name for the remote SSH session workerprocesses  5  events    workerconnections  1024   Default 1024   http    defaulttype applicationoctetstream   logformat   main remoteaddr  remoteuser [timelocal]  status      request bodybytessent httpreferer      httpuseragent httpxforwardedfor   sendfile     on   servernameshashbucketsize 128  this seems to be required for some vhosts    server      listen 80     servername      location           proxypass httplocalhost8000         proxyhttpversion 1.1         proxysetheader Upgrade httpupgrade         proxysetheader Connection upgrade         proxysetheader Host host           codepre  pI made the config file as an amalgam of a general example and a websocket specific one, but trying to fiddle with it has not solved the issue.

It will only let me post one link here, take off the h150 to see the original image you wont see it in your browser, because its completely white, download it to see it.p  pBut after being processed with GD, it has grainy light gray artifacts in the background, and theres now a gray border around the white text. If youre using an LCD, look up at it from an angle and youll see how bad it is.p  pUpdate This doesnt happen with imagecopyresized, only imagecopyresampled.p  pPHPInfo  a hrefhttpcdn.squidix.com relnofollowhttpcdn.squidix.comap

Negative 8257 pI have a C ASP.NET project with 15 WCFASMX Service References. Each service is deployed to three different servers codetestcode, codestagingcode and codelivecode.p  pOften we need to change the URLs of these service references to different servers, to be able to debug using the correct service with the correct implementation and data.p  pWhen managing these Service References Im having a hard time keeping the URL in sync. When creating a Service Reference codeFooServicecode it stores the URL in three seperate filesp  ul liFooService.discoli liconfiguration.svcinfoli liReference.svcmapli ul  pAlong with creating an codeendpointcode node with the URL in the codeWeb.configcode.p  pIf I change the endpoint URL in the Web.config and rebuild the project, it doesnt update the URL in the other files, so its out of sync. So when I rightclick the codeFooServicecode and click codeUpdate Service Referencecode it doesnt use the URL stored in the codeWeb.configcode, it uses the URL in the other files.p  pSo the only way is to rightclick the codeFooServicecode and click on codeConfigure Service Referencecode and enter the new URL. But that doesnt always work, because sometimes it creates a new node in Web.config named codeFooService1code, so I get an error when running my application saying that there are two instances of the same endpoints.p  pSo often I need to skim through the Web.config and delete duplicates of endpoints, which is very frustrating.p  pWhat is the best way to manage multiple WCF service references when changing the URL to the service oftenp

Why does the listener is executed at the UI Thread  so, even if I use join, the join is just a test to debug, but the image gallery is created without the images downloaded, and I cant download nothing because is the main thread And...

Negative 8257 pI am using an external service to perform a search for my application.p  pThe results of this search need to be collected from multiple partners and take between 10 and 90 seconds to complete.

Negative 8257 pIm using IDL to take an image of the outside surface of a cylinder and flatten it to obtain a roughly accurate noncurved picture. I have already done the math necessary to know that given an input pixel at location x,y[with 0,0 being the center of the image], where the output pixel x,y should be, but I cannot figure out how to apply this to build my new image. I am also aware that due to the fact that the flattened image is larger than the original image, some pixels on the final image will not have a corresponding input pixel do they appear black Transparent, but Ill deal with that when I get there.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8257 pwhat Im trying to do is a web server that simply answers clients requests. I am able to use PHP scripts, an executable written in C or services written in Java to create the response, but the problem is they always have to be loaded with every request from the client, which lowers the efficiency and requires me to save data in some file or db to exchange them between requests cant use sessions, exchanging data between various clients.p  pSo Im looking for some script that would run continuosly on the server, listen to incomming requests, produce an answer and send it back. Useful, but not necessary features would be br based on CC, but doesnt have to be br able to deal with http, since the clients is a website sending JSON br can be easily used with some server solutionp  pMy idea was like having a one C program running continuously maintaining all the informations in the CPU and sharing its memory with small programs, that would be started with each request comming, that would grab the data from the shared memory and do some processing to create the answer no extensive computing, can be loaded multiple times. Does it sound a little possiblep  pWould be enough to name some technology work checking out, thank you, Martin C.p

Negative 8257 pI am doing data recovery for a company. They need one type of file specifically, created in a java software package from the government. Filenames are lost, but the files themselves contain the project name. You can only find these when you actually open them in that software though, the files themselves do not contain any plain text. There are many thousands of files, so we cant expect someone to manually open them and update the filenames.p  pAn added difficulty is that there are several different formats of these files the most recent version of the software cant just open files from the previous version, it needs to convert them. This gives me the impression that the files are simply Objects that have been saved, and with each software version they change their Class so much that old files cant be cast into their new Class anymore. Or something. Its been a while since I programmed in java. p  pIn any case, I simply want to read a single property of that object. But I dont have its Class to parse it with which can be one of many, depending on the software version the file was saved with. I have the jar files from that software, but am hoping I dont need to start analysing that whole software package to see what it does exactly. p  pSo I finally get to my question can I open such a file assuming its indeed a saved Object, and somehow parse its contents as plain text Im sure that once that is done, I can retrieve where the project name is saved  hopefully in the same place across software versions. p

Negative 8257 pi have been working with lwjgl and also j3d for the geometry part. i am still working on the collision. what i have so far witht he collision is working decently but there are 2 problems. to sum up my current way of colliding, it tests if the previous coordinate and current coordinate go through a trianglewhat things are rendered as and then it finds the point on the triangle that it just intersected that is closest to your current coordinate and makes you go there. it also makes your y coordinate go up by .001. this workd descent but going up .001 is bad becuase if you go to a triangle that is at a 90 angle going updards you can go left to rigth but you cant back up out of it, almost as if you are stuck in it. here is a drawing of how it works on imgurp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.com1gMhRut.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com1gMhRut.pngap  pfrom here i want to add say .001 to the length between the current coordinate and the closest point i already know these points and get the new current point.p  pbtw prev is where the person was at before they moved to the cur point and then it tests to see if those 2 points intersect a triangle and then i get the closest point to the prev if it does which is defined as closest in the picture. i can already calculate for all of those pointsp
Negative 8257 pWe are using a Change Data Capture tool to migrate source data to a target database in near realtime. The challenge is to identify as accurately as possible the data migration latency that exists between  source and target. The latency reporting capabilities of the tool are not to our satisfaction and so I have been tasked with developing a process that will better monitor this specific metric.p  pThere are two main reasons why we need to know thisp  p1 Provide our users with an accurate data availability matrix to support report scheduling. For example,    How much time should pass after midnight before scheduling a daily reconciliation report for the     previous day given that we want this information as soon as possiblep  p2 Identify situations when the data mirroring process is running slower than usual or has even stopped.    This will trigger an email to our support team to investigate.p  pI am looking for some general ideas of how to best go about this seemingly simple taskp

Negative 8257 pI am in the process of creating my own webapi in asp.net using oauth as authorization provider. The api wil basically serve as a provider for different modules as i call them. One could be a image gallery, the other could just be a user login module with different types of users.p  pI have the oauth part working fine. Api users can register and then ask for a Token by calling the Token endpoint with the login credentials. p  pHowever i now want to create another seperate user module in the api that is only accessible by apiusers that registered . I want this module to have another register and login function and have their own endpoint to login UserModuleToken or something like that. The users coming from the user module are different users than the Api users. So the apiusers are the actual developers that want to call specific modules in my api, and the users from the user module are users that register on the site where that module is implemented. p  pAll of my apicontrollers wil have the [Authorize] attribute for the api user, and i want specific ones, for example some function in the user module, to be decorated with [UserModuleAuthorize] attribute.p  pBelow you can see my api user entity modelp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class ApiUserEntity  BaseEntity      public string Username  get set      public string Password  get set      public string Email  get set      public string Salt  get set      public ApiUserLevel Level  get set   codepre  pThe userservice function that can validate an api user p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic UserLoginResult LoginUserApiUserEntityLoginForm userForm       retrieve user from database     var user  userRepository.GetUseruserForm.UserName      ifuser  null         return modelStateWrapper.AddErrorUserLoginResult.UserNotFound, User does not exist      var passwordHash  PasswordHash.HashPassworduser.Salt, userForm.Password       check if password matches with database.     if passwordHash  user.Password         return modelStateWrapper.AddErrorUserLoginResult.IncorrectPassword, Incorrect password      return UserLoginResult.Success  codepre  pAnd calling the Token endpoint in my webapi will call the following function of the token providerp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic override async Task GrantResourceOwnerCredentialsOAuthGrantResourceOwnerCredentialsContext context       context.OwinContext.Response.Headers.AddAccessControlAllowOrigin, new[]          create a userloginform object       var loginForm  new ApiUserEntityLoginForm UserName  context.UserName, Password  context.Password       pass it into the login validation function of the userservice     var loginResult  userService.LoginUserloginForm       if login result was not sucesful, return an error.     if loginResult  UserLoginResult.Success              var jsonSerialiser  new JavaScriptSerializer         var json  jsonSerialiser.SerializeuserService.Errors          context.SetErrorinvalidgrant, json         return            result was succesful, grant the token.     var identity  new ClaimsIdentitycontext.Options.AuthenticationType     identity.AddClaimnew Claimsub, context.UserName     identity.AddClaimnew Claimrole, user      context.Validatedidentity   codepre  pi configure my oauth provider and define the Token endpoint with the following functionp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic static void ConfigureOAuthIAppBuilder app, IUnityContainer container       var simpleAuthorizationServerProvider  container.ResolveltSimpleAuthorizationServerProvidergt      var OAuthServerOptions  new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions              AllowInsecureHttp  true,         TokenEndpointPath  new PathStringtoken,         AccessTokenExpireTimeSpan  TimeSpan.FromDays1,         Provider  simpleAuthorizationServerProvider            Token Generation     app.UseOAuthAuthorizationServerOAuthServerOptions     app.UseOAuthBearerAuthenticationnew OAuthBearerAuthenticationOptions   codepre  pNow my question is if it is somehow possible to have multiple token endpoints so i can have a token for apiusers and then another one for a user that is using the custom user module and protect certain functionality based on those 2 users.p  pI couldnt find any information about this after an extensive amount of searching the internet.

Negative 8257 pstrongProblem Descriptionstrongp  pI am using Fancybox v2.1.5 in a responsive page design. The problem I have is with smaller mobile devices that are more rectangular than square. p  pWhen the device is in portrait orientation and I call Fancybox, it displays to the width of the screen and the title text wraps below the image. This is not an issue as there is usually a lot of extra screen real estate in portrait mode.p  pWhen I change the device to landscape orientation however, Fancybox shrinks its height in response to the shorter screen height. p  pThe width obviously shrinks proportionally as well. As the title box width is also controlled by the width of the Fancybox container, which adjusts to the image width, it means that the text wraps even more and usually  causes the image to shrink more as it gets resized smaller to accommodate the space needed for the title text wrapping.p  pI have unsuccessfully tried playing around with the Fancybox CSS and media queries but reading other posts here suggests you need javascript functionality to effectively do this and while I am pretty solid with html and CSS, I am still fairly shaky with javascript.p  pstrongDesired Functionalitystrongp  pId like to be able to be able to test for short screen heights and format the Fancybox title to give as much real estate to the image, as possible. p  pIdeally this would be by being above to control Fancybox Title font size and allow the titlebox to extend out past the container boundaries.p  pAny help in the form of coding suggestions or pointing me to other posts that I amy have missed would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8257 pI use an external library which operates on large quantities of data. The data is passed in by a raw pointer, plus the length.

The sample code supplied by the manufacturer is rather dirty, it involves switchcaseing the endpoint to which the interrupt belongs and if it is a setup packet containing a classspecific request, it make a switchcase for every interface or endpoint that may be the target of the request.p  pI figured I can make things prettier by defining an array of structurep  precodetypedef void UsbEventCallbackuint32t u32IntFlag, uint32t u32EPSTS typedef uint32t UsbClassReqCallbackvoid  typedef struct      uint8t epaddress     uint32t config     uint32t buffoffset     UsbClassReqCallback usbclassreqcb     UsbEventCallback usbeventcb  ATTRPACKED EPConfigStruct  typedef struct      uint8t interfaceid     UsbClassReqCallback usbclassreqcb  ATTRPACKED InterfaceConfigStruct  extern const EPConfigStruct EPconfigsettings[TOTALNUMENDPOINTS] extern const InterfaceConfigStruct interfacesconfigsettings[TOTALNUMINTERFACES] codepre  pand then, in the interrupt callback I dop  precodeswitch  reqdestination   case 1 interface     for  uint8t interfaceindex  0  interfaceindex lt TOTALNUMINTERFACES  interfaceindex               if  interfacesconfigsettings[interfaceindex].interfaceid  UsbDev.Setup.wIndex                       if  interfacesconfigsettings[interfaceindex].usbclassreqcb  NULL                  return FALSE             else                 return interfacesconfigsettings[interfaceindex].usbclassreqcb                   break case 2 endpoint     for  uint8t epindex  0  epindex lt TOTALNUMENDPOINTS  epindex               if  EPconfigsettings[epindex].epaddress  UsbDev.Setup.wIndex                       if  EPconfigsettings[epindex].usbclassreqcb  NULL                  return FALSE             else                 return EPconfigsettings[epindex].usbclassreqcb                   break  return FALSE codepre  pMy questions are Is it better to not actually make all these decisions and calling all these other functions in interrupt time Am I better to just save the interrupt data and switch some flag on requiring the main thread to process the interrupt How important is it to return from the callback as soon as possiblep  pWhat do you think is the correct architecture for such a programp  pThank youp

Negative 8257 pIm looking for a better, or more optimized, method for copying or in the actual problem, transforming an nary tree emwithoutem using recursion.

The first keeps track of the items from the original tree that need to be processed, and the second keeps track of the newly created copies so that we can appropriately assign linkage between nodes this could be divided into two stacks instead of Tuples, hence three.

However, I would very much like to avoid busy waiting.p  hr  h2EDITh2  pFrom the comments and the answer by pilcrow, it looks like there are basically two approaches possible.p  ol liEnqueue a special Terminate message, as proposed by Alan, mukunda and pilcrow. I decided against this option because I have no idea about the size of the queue at the time I want the actor to terminate. It may very well be as it is mostly the case when I want something to quickly terminate that there are thousands of messages left to process in the queue and it seems unacceptable to wait for them to be processed until finally the terminate message gets its turn.li liImplement a custom version of a condition variable, that may be interrupted by another thread by forwarding the notification to the condition variable that the first thread is waiting on. I opted for this approach.li ol  pFor those of you interested, my implementation goes as follows. The condition variable in my case is actually a codesemaphorecode because I like them more and because I liked the exercise of doing so. I equipped this semaphore with an associated codeinterruptcode which can be obtained from the semaphore via codesemaphoregetinterruptcode. If now one thread blocks in codesemaphorewaitcode, another thread has the possibility to call codesemaphoreinterrupttriggercode on the interrupt of the semaphore, causing the first thread to unblock and propagate an codeinterruptexceptioncode.p  precodestruct interruptexception   class semaphore      public class interrupt     private mutable stdmutex mutex       must be declared after our mutex due to construction order     private interrupt informedby     private stdatomicltlonggt counter     private stdconditionvariable cond      public      semaphore      public      semaphore throw      public void      wait      public interruptamp     getinterrupt const  return informedby       public void     post          stdlockguardltstdmutexgt lockmutex         counter         cond.notifyone  never throws           public unsigned long     load  const          return counter.load        class semaphoreinterrupt      private semaphore forwardpoststo     private stdatomicltboolgt triggered      public     interruptsemaphore forwardpoststo  triggeredfalse, forwardpoststoforwardpoststo          assertforwardpoststo         stdlockguardltstdmutexgt lockforwardpoststogtmutex         forwardpoststogtinformedby  this           public void     trigger          assertforwardpoststo         stdlockguardltstdmutexgtforwardpoststogtmutex          triggered  true         forwardpoststogtcond.notifyone  never throws           public bool     istriggered  const throw          return triggered.load           public void     reset  throw          return triggered.storefalse        semaphoresemaphore   counter0L, informedbynew interruptthis    must be declared here because otherwise semaphoreinterrupt is an incomplete type semaphoresemaphore throw       delete informedby   void semaphorewait      stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockmutex     if0Lcounter          cond.waitlock,[amp]             ifinformedbygtistriggered                 throw interruptexception             return countergt0                   counter  codepre  pUsing this codesemaphorecode, my message queue implementation now looks like this using the semaphore instead of the codestdconditionvariablecode I could get rid of the codestdmutexcodep  precodeclass messagequeue          private stdqueueltmessagegt queue     private semaphore newmsgnotification      public void     pushmessageampamp msg          queue.pushstdmovemsg         newmsgnotification.post           public const message     waitandpop          newmsgnotification.wait         auto msgstdmovequeue.front         queue.pop         return msg           public semaphoreinterruptamp     getinterrupt const  return newmsgnotification.getinterrupt   codepre  pMy codeactorcode, is now able to interrupt its thread with very low latency in its thread.

Negative 8257 pI am programming a little and very simple bruteforce program. The idea was to have a masterthread, counting the first letter of a string and then they are completed to full passwords to compare it with the real password.p  pThread 1 aaaaa to azzzzp  pThread 2 baaaa to bzzzz p  petc., when checking small letters only.p  pThe completion is done with a recursive prozedure. The thread gets his first letter a and calls the procedure, building aaaaa, aaaab, aaaac, aaaad.. azzzy, azzzz.p  pThe problem is, that the recursive procedure gets slower with each thread. My system is a quadcore CPU, but even running it with 2 threads slows down the procedure for 6 letters from around 20 seconds to 38 seconds and randomly even 1min 30 seconds.p  pI actually think it would be some issue with memory access, but I cannot find it. The time is only measured for the procedure itself, so anything around it shouldnt interfere with it. The code looks probably a bit fcked up, because I tried so many different things already, moved parts, inserted outputs for checks etc.. sorry for that.p  pHere is my codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include lttime.hgt include ltomp.hgt  static void bruteForcechar currentPW, int index, int PWLength, char alphabet, int alphabetSize char alphabet[]    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz                     ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ                     ,.ampltgt                     0123456789 int alphabetSize timet gStartTime, gEndTime int ompgetnumthreadsvoid  int mainint argc, char argv      int PWLength  9     int i  0     int currentPWLength     ompsetdynamic0      Explicitly disable dynamic teams       Timer starten     time ampgStartTime       forcurrentPWLength  6 currentPWLength lt PWLength currentPWLength                Create teams         pragma omp parallel privatealphabetSize numthreads2                      alphabetSize  sizeofalphabet  1              We will copy the alphabet in our own memory, so there is no race condition             char threadAlphabet  mallocsizeofalphabet             strncpythreadAlphabet, alphabet, alphabetSize               Only one thread will do this             pragma omp single nowait             for i  0 i lt alphabetSize i                               int j  0                  We will store the startStrings in memory                  This could be also done in an array, but at this point we do not need a                  structure.                 char startString  malloccurrentPWLength  1                 startString[0]  alphabet[i]                 forj  1 j lt currentPWLength j                     startString[j]  0                   At this point there will be 30 tasks to be solved.

Negative 8257 pWere seeing some strange, though somewhat predictable behavior using Mongoose in a load test. After the test is finished, the service keeps making queries for a while after the load ends. I think it could be that the queries are being enqueued and not dropped after the timeout expires.p  pLets say that were making queries every 5ms that take 10ms to execute. With a single connection, two things could happen p  ol liHalf of the queries are dropped because the connection is in use.li liThe excess queries are enqueued and executed when the connection frees up.li ol  pI could not find anything in the documentation that described the behavior of Mongoose when a database is overloaded like this. It looks like the latter option is occurring.p  pThere is an option for setting a query timeout, but it doesnt say whether that timeout is measured from the initial query request, or the execution of the query against the database. I suspect it is also the latter.p

Negative 8257 pI try to wait until all running packages are finished on SQL Server after I started an SSIS package, but I cannot figure out the correct way to do it.

The documentation also says Do not reference this method directly....br A refresh is needed because otherwise the executions collection is cached and returns 0 new transactions. And when it runs without deadlocks it returns the amount of running packages correctly.p  pSo I am trying to find a way to see if all packages are finished running. The package I am running is a master package that starts multiple other packages. Otherwise I could simply get the Execution ID and get the operation state from the catalog, but that is not possible in this case.p

Negative 8257 pI have a problem with Xcode bots. Im able to compile, test and archive my project, but I would like to use external tool that checks if I did code review for last commits. I would like to be able to abort build if there is no code review.  I tried to add codeexit 1code or codeexit 0code in prebuild script but it just ends given script not whole building process. So my question is how I can abort Xcode bot build integrationp

Negative 8257 pI got 3 tables articles, categories and relations. p  pAn article can be assigned to more than one category, and relations table is in charge of tracking that. And one more thing to note, articles table has a longtext type field articlecontent. And the indexes of the tables are articles.articleid, categories.categoryid, relations.relationsid. For the articles table, there is another index articletitle, articlecontent, but I dont it would be used in this case.p  pThe problematic query is likep  precodeSELECT COUNTarticles.articleid  FROM articles, relations, categories  WHERE relations.articleidarticles.articleid AND       relations.categoryidcategories.categoryid AND        relations.categoryid1566 AND        articlestatus IN approved,featured AND       articleexpirydate00000000 OR articleexpirydate gt now codepre  pTherere initially 21k records in articles, 1.9k records in categories and 25k records in relations table. The time used to run the query is about 0.0019 second. p  pWhat I need to do is deleting articles, relations, categories records which are in a specific categories. And within this categories, there are child categories and articles. So I run some query to get a list of the categories recursively and put the list in an array tmparray.  Then for each array, I deleted articles assigned to it, then delete the category itself and at last delete the relations, with a simplest queryp  precodeForeachtmparray as cat      artquery1  DELETE phpkbarticles                    FROM phpkbrelations, phpkbarticles                    WHERE phpkbrelations.categoryid  cat AND                         phpkbarticles.articleid  phpkbrelations.articleid      mysqlqueryartquery1,connection      artquery2  DELETE phpkbcategories                   FROM phpkbcategories                   WHERE phpkbcategories.categoryid  cat      mysqlqueryartquery2,connection      artquery3  DELETE phpkbrelations                   FROM phpkbrelations                   WHERE phpkbrelations.categoryid  cat      mysqlqueryartquery3,connection  codepre  pThis goes well. And after the deletion, there are 19k records in articles, 1.6k records in categories and 22k records in relations table.p  pThen I run the problematic query again, now the time is about 0.1 seconds, almost 50 times worse than before. I have to run this query for likely thousands times so the result is a huge time difference. p  pAlso, Im very curious about why there is such kind of performance difference. As the query stays the same and the records number actually decreases, there is no reason for that.p  pIs there anything wrong about query or did the DB get messed up upon the deletion of records Can anybody help to answer my questions Thanks a lotp

Negative 8257 pTLDR Getting different results after running code with threading and multiprocessing and single threaded. Need guidance on troubleshooting. p  pHello, I apologize in advance if this may be a bit too generic, but I need a bit of help troubleshooting an issue and I am not sure how best to proceed. p  pHere is the story I have a bunch of data indexed into a Solr Collection 250m items, all items in that collection have a sessionid. Some items can share the same session id. I am combing through the collection to extract all items that have the same session, massage the data a bit and spit out another JSON file for indexing later. p  pThe code has two main functions  procday  accepts a day and processes all the sessions for that day and procsession  does everything that needs to happen for a single session. p  pMultiprocessing is implemented on procday, so each day would be processed by a separate process, the procsession function can be ran with threads. Below is the code I am using for threadingmultiprocessing below. It accepts a function, a list of arguments and number of threads  multiprocesses. It will then create a queue based on input args, then create processesthreads and let them go through it.

Negative 8257 pIm working on an application running on Google App engine python with the frontend in AngularJS framework. The backend of this app simply returns the relevant data as JSON upon a GET for example, the URL routes for which are configured in the frontend as services etc. That is, the standard CRUD operations are performed using the HTTP verbs, which i think is the main idea of a REST backend.p  pWhat id like to know is how is this backend different from a REST API What i can make out by myself is that an API returns data similar to a response from a backend but it also sends more information about the various optionsavailable actions the client has at any given moment. Is this the right idea If so, how would you go about using this information Wouldnt the application using this API become highly coupled with itp  pAnd if i have to convert the REST backend to use the API, what benefits would i get. Docs about REST API say that it makes it easy for app on different platforms to access the data uniformly like a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocspythonendpoints relnofollowherea. But the same thing can be done by a simple REST backend since the data itself is platform agnostic and as long as we can write a frontend to handle the data properly on each platform.p

Another thing is that the graph is directed, but we would like the program to ignore the directions when computing the paths but still return the actually directed edges once it spots those paths. p  pFor instance p  pa  c lt d  b is a valid path between nodes a and b of length 3.p  pThanks in advance.p

This makes sense, since thats the job of codeObjectInputStreamcode in a standard Java clientserver model and its blocking, and Akka isnt big on blocking.p  pMy question is, are there any standard Akka featuresactors that mimic the functionality of an codeObjectInputStreamcode when regestered as a handler to the Tcp manager Or do I really have to manually implement the packet merging myself If so, how would I go about doing thatp  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 8257 pI am trying to understand what my instructor wants me to do. In his description  Design, implement and test a Java program Multiplication.java which includes an iterative method multIterative and a recursive method multRecursive. Both methods take the same parameters, the two positive integer numbers that will be multiplied and return the multiplication result. For both methods, use the technique of repetitive additions for achieving the multiplication of the two numbers. As an example, 4 multiplied by 6 should be calculated as 6  6  6  6 i.e. four times six. p  pI can understand the multiplication for recursion but not the iterative.

Negative 8257 pI somehow cant comprehend how the storage duration of compound literals defined in blocks is automatic, and the reasoning is as followsp  plet us assume that the compound literal is defined in a function or block that is called repeatedly when this function is called for the first time, how can the computer create the literal if it is not in static memory to begin with  what I mean is how does he know its value for example is it int [2] 2,4 or int [5] 5,4,2,1,4 and if it somehow exists anywhere, how does the computer know its contents again  when he tries to construct it again for the second and every subsequent call after its first pass away.p  pthe case with other literals such as string literals and normal literals is that they are in static memory, and this is very reasonable because how can the computer know its value if he hasnt stored this value somewhere.p  pcan anyone explain this properly to mep

Negative 8257 pI have a 45GB custom postgres dump that I need to restore into an installation of Postgres 9.4.1 on Linux. I need to minimize the amount of time it takes.p  pJust for clarity sake, that GB estimate is the compressed dump. The actual DB is around 30GB in Postgres. p  pIm quite experienced with pgrestore, especially tweaking its parameters and my postgres setup in order to make restores run quicker. Ive had a lot of success in speeding up restores in Postgres 8.x and 9.1. Mainly Ive been able to do it by passing the j option into pgrestore and setting up postgres conf settings such as maintenance memory and what not.p  pI am now migrating to Postgres 9.4.1 and now it seems that, no matter what I do, pgrestore runs slow. Suspiciously slow. I do not have an exact time its taking for the 45GB dump, but it is too slow. I used to have it running at about 5 or 6 minutes, but now it is much slower. Even a 100MB takes around 2 minutes no matter what my settings are.p  pDoes anyone know if there are any special considerations in regard to running pgrestore with Postgres 9.4 I cant see any difference in what I am doing. The j option alone seems to have no discernible effect, which is in stark contrast to what used to happen before 9.4.p

Long column names are difficult to work with for various display reasons as well as programmatic ones.

Does anyone have some better suggestions In particular I need to subset data, amp I also find indexing by number to be clumsy amp error prone. p  pDue to large data relative to RAM, I cannot keep copies of both numeric amp labelled data.frames. I have also tried creating hash objects using the hash packagep  precodelibraryhash myHash lt hashcolnamesmyDF, labelmyDF codepre  pOr via listsp  precodenameList lt list forname in colnamesmyDF    nameList[[name]] lt labelmyDF[name]  codepre  pBut... I also find these unsatisfactory mostly because they can fall out of synch with myDF after various manipulations amp they are not accessible from the same object. Perhaps I just need to be more diligent. p  pLastly, I thought that perhaps a solution would be a custom class that contains a data.frame amp some other data structures to know the very meaningless terse name, the verbose amp nonunique nickname, amp the true variable name. But this would require overloading all the indexing operators amp is likely way over my head skill wise.p  pSo any other purposed solutions Any help appreciated. p

Also running queries asynchronously, and therefore taking advantage of parallel computation should be, and is, faster than running them sequentially, but what about the prepared vs nonprepared statementp  pWeve always read and heard blogs, summits, evangelists, ... that we should favor prepared statements over non prepared whenever possible, but this results are confusing...p  pTo give you a bit of background weve used two different tools one internally built and cassandrastress both throwing the same results. p  pHas anyone come across this before Which is the explanation What are we missingp  pRegardsp  pEdit p  ul lia hrefhttpsgist.github.comcalonso99878f5495a51e68037e relnofollowResults using cassandrastress toolali lia hrefhttpsgist.github.comcalonso43ea2c5e7a61f831a86c relnofollowResults using our own Ruby scriptali ul

Negative 8257 pI have a very complex problem. My company developed an SDK, and the result is an AAR file that has been published on a remote Maven repository which can be accessed anonymously. However, this AAR has several dependencies, for examplep  precodedependencies      compile fileTreedir libs, include [.jar]     compile fileslibsBluetoothLeLibrary0.0.2.jar     compile com.google.code.gsongson2.3      compile com.company.sdk.clientsdkclientlib1.2.1.1jar     compile com.company.internal.commonsenums1.0jar      compile com.google.android.gmsplayserviceslocation6.5.87     compile com.android.supportsupportv421.0.3     compile com.google.guavaguava18.0     compile com.google.apiclientgoogleapiclientandroid1.17.0rc     compilecom.google.apiclientgoogleapiclient1.17.0rc          excludegroup xpp3, module xpp3         excludegroup org.apache.httpcomponents, module httpclient         excludegroup junit, module junit         excludegroup com.google.android, module android          compilecom.google.httpclientgooglehttpclientandroid1.17.0rc          excludegroup com.google.android, module android       codepre  pThe ones that start with com.company are private libraries that our company uses. They are located on another Maven repo, that is only accessible to employees and collaborators using a username and password.p  pNow, this AAR file can be used by any developer in order to access its features. However, if the dependency is added like shown on Code Sample A, the build process breaks, since it requires access to Google Play Services variable integergoogleplayservicesversion used in the Android Manifest. I found two workarounds for this, shown on Code Sample B and C. However, by using Code Sample B, the app that uses the SDK tries to download and access the companys private libraries but since they are only accessible through a user and password, they are simply not found by gradle. On the other hand, Code Sample C leaves the app unable to find classes and methods on those libraries weirdly enough, the code compiles and runs, but the app crashes with a java.lang.VerifyError and rejecting the SDKs classes.p  pHow can I add these private libraries to the AAR, in order to avoid the app to try to download them Or how could I solve this issuep  pCode Sample Ap  precodecompile com.company.sdklibrary1.3.0.0aar codepre  pCode Sample Bp  precodecompile com.company.sdklibrary1.3.0.0aar     transitivetrue  codepre  pCode Sample Cp  precodecompile com.google.android.gmsplayserviceslocation6.5.87 compile com.company.cc.sdklibrary1.3.0.2aar     excludegroup com.google.android.gms, moduleplayserviceslocation  codepre

Negative 8257 pWhile learning SQLAlchemy I came across two ways of dealing with SQLAlchemys sessions. One was creating the session once globally while initializing my database likep  precodeDBSession  scopedsessionsessionmakerextensionZopeTransactionExtension codepre  pand import this DBSession instance in all my requests all my insertupdate operations that follow.

For a bulky insert operation, does adding         objects to the session result in adding them to the memoryRAM or         elsewhere where do they get stored and how much memory is consumedpli liBoth the ways tend to be very slow when I have about a         million inserts and updates.

Negative 8257 pHello everybody I have this big and frustrating problem,p  pI have forked a project from git and as usual it is available in my account in GitHub. I then set up a project in eclipse selecting from an existing URI. All is ok, if I work with my own version of the project.p  pWhat I want to do is, because the project is changing and growing day by day, to have an updated copy from the original project and, every time I want to download any change I would like that the download is from the original project.p  pAt the moment the only way with EXTREMELY big problems I found is using Team  Fetch from Upstream the changing the link to the repos using the config button. Obviously this lead to conflicts and annoying problems. I am sure that this is not the correct way to handle a forked repos and I need help.p  pI am using windows 7 and eclipse with egit, if I press WindowsR and then cmd it dont recognize the command git so I cant use console commands.p  pAny helpp

Negative 8257 pOk, so Ill just start off saying Im almost certain this bug is either arising from my lack of understanding of isolate scoping in angular directives or some weird interaction between directives and the angular google maps markers directive.p  pAnyways, the issue is that I have an instance of the angulargooglemaps stuff in my main controller, and I have a  tag within that. I also have a directive which is captures user inputs and uses them to populate a list in the main controller for the  tag to do its thing. I pass in an object and function from the main controller into the directives isolate scope.p  pThe weird thing is that within my directives, I have bound this function onto a button click for a form, and for some reason, it takes 2 clicks to get the marker to appear. The function fires the first click, it has all the right values and everything, but the marker doesnt appear. Another weird I checked was simply calling the method twice in a row for one click which didnt work still required 2 button presses.p  pThe function modifies the array in the main controller I have a feeling this is the root of the issue which is used by the  tag as a list of markers. Any ideas on why this could be happening If it doesnt seem like an obvious misunderstanding of Angular scoping, I can post code.p

Negative 8257 pIn reading this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions101693customerrorsmodeoffquestiona, I asked in one of the answers the followingp  pThis answer implies that ASP.NET reads web.config and other config files from the top, ie topdown. I thought config files were read as a single instance meaning that the compiler first parses the config file for accuracy and then compiles it, but it seems to be compiling it on the fly  line by line.p  pIs that truep  pHow does ASP.NET deal with config files Is there a link someone could share with me the order of processing config files in ASP.NETp

Negative 8257 pI would like to learn how to create a simple drawing app for iOS. I can get to the point of actually drawing the line with a UIBezierPath. Ive created a custom view and I use drawRect to stroke the UIBezierPaths its not the most efficient, because Im drawing every line every time. Once I get the basics, Ill drill down into more efficient implementations. p  pMy question is this how do I implement an eraser function I dont want a simple hack like using a path with a white stroke color I want a legit erase function. I cant figure out how to do this, and I have searched many resources online for this. Some ideas Ive had are hit testing to erase certain points in a line and drawing a special eraser line that does some sort of blending to erase other lines. I dont think the latter is possible, and I have no idea how to implement the former, or if its even possible. p  pDoes anyone have some insight they can share on thisp

When it is under 580px, the JQuery script determines the height, but as you shrink or expand the window, it jumps back and forth between Cycle2s auto height and the JQuery scripts calculated height.p

Negative 8257 pWhen handling a web applications state, like current playing song or current active algorithm, I would like to use a codevarcode to store the value, and this value may be changed over time. I usually wrap the variable with an actor and readwrite the variable by actors messages, but this prevent concurrent read of the variable. Im not sure if it will be a performance inpact Is it a practical way to handle state like this Or if I just store the value in a DB and let DB handle the lock and transactions, would it be an overkillp

Negative 8257 pSuppose I have a function in CC which is called quite frequently lets say its connect to a timer which is timeout at least 10 times per second and that function needs to use a given variablecontainer an integer or maybe a string or an array. Now, naturally enough, the process of creating this variable in memory costs some processor clocks running the same function again and again therefore means Ill loose quite some processor clock ticks for doing exactly the same thing many times. This could be prevented by either making that variable global, member of the functions class or codestaticcode in any of such cases, the variablecontainer would be created only once and many processor clock ticks used to always do the same operation would be saved.p  pMy question is is this operation actually worth it when it comes to performance In other words, is the creation of variables as global, members of a class or as codestaticcode an actual way to improve even if just a little bit the performance of a code or is there something else that might easily kill any possible improvement For example, codestaticcode variables might be always created on the heap instead of in the stack, and since the first is slower then the second, this would end up killing the performance of such strategy Or there is no global rule for knowing things because it depends a lot of specific issues such as the processor being used, optimizations done by the compiler and types of variablescontainers such that only a benchmark with casebycase study could actually tell the differencep

Negative 8257 pI have 2 different servers. In server 2 I have a API function which basically does video conversion of the file and generates thumbs. I have created logs after each functions in server 2 and server1 so that I can check what is happening in the server. From server1 I make a curl call which calls server2 API and sends necessary info like path and type of file etc to server2. The server to converts the media files and generate thumbs. All this process is done using ffmpeg and then server2 uploads converted video to rackspace cloud. This process runs in a cron job. In the cron job server1 reads media file path from a table and sends them one by one to server 2 by curl call. p  pstrongProblemstrong This process takes time and what is happening that when server2 code is processing 1st video file server1 sends another video file. It does not wait for the response of server 2. Now server two is processing 1st and second then meanwhile server1 sends another then all videos in server two processed.Server two sends response for all videos one by one. I can see whole process in logs. But Im not getting how this can be happen in PHP. As far as I read that PHP lines executes one by one. So server 1 should wait for response of server2.p  pNote I have increased  curl timeout also but that also does not work.p

Negative 8257 pI am trying to allocate some memory using sysbrk in NASMx86 assembly. sysbreak returns the new address of break, which is the end of the data segment right So where does my newly allocated memory reside I assumed that it is in between the old break value and the new break value. So if I allocate 64bytes of memory with sysbrk i can use the next 64 bytes starting from the old break value that i stored before calling sysbrk. Am I rightp  pMy Assembly code that will allocate memory will look somewhat like this.a hrefhttpsgist.github.comnikAizuddinf4132721126257ec4345 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comnikAizuddinf4132721126257ec4345ap  pAnd another side question is p  pI am supposed to write a function in Assembly that returns the pointer to the dynamically allocated memory and that function will be called from a C program.

Is there any way to have camel identify the codeServletcode initiated by codeUndertowcodep
