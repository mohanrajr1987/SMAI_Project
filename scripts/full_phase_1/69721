Beginning   June 1, 2015 app updates will also need to follow the same   requirements. To enable 64bit in your project, we recommend using the   default Xcode build setting of Standard architectures to build a   single binary with both 32bit and 64bit code.   After youve corrected the issues, you can use Xcode or Application Loader   to upload a new binary to iTunes Connect.p blockquote  pThe last time I did a release I couldnt upload the app until I fixed the 64bit build so I know thats okay, but Im still building against the iOS 5 SDK because our app still supports it. If I change to build for the iOS 8 SDK will this stop my app working for older versions of iOS How can I tell if new functionality will still work on iOS 5p

Negative 69721 pIm trying to create a colorpicker which must dynamically generate its images and figured it would be a whole lot easier to generate SVG than a raster image.

Negative 69721 pSo Im currently working on a project that needs to time when certain processes are running. Im trying to figure out the most efficient way to scan the process list, then check the process list executable names against the list of supported programs.p  pEssentially the problem is two partsp  p1 Most efficient way to get the process executable names from the process listp  p2 Most efficient way to compare this list to another listp  pFor 1, one of the other developers was playing around with using the tasklist command and parsing out the executable names. I also found out that C has a System.Diagnostic process list that will do this automatically. Were still trying to decide between Java and C so I probably would lean towards a language neutral solution, but this could be a deciding factor for C.p  pFor 2, supported process list might be small on average 110 process names. We could just run each process through the list, but we were thinking this might be too much for older PCs, so we were tossing around the idea of using an alphabetically balanced AVL tree containing the initial process list when the application starts, and checking everything against that first, and then checking against our supported process names list if its not in the tree.p  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciated.p  pemEdit Apparently you can filter tasklist by process executable name, so we could just do that for every process on the supported process list.emp  pemEdit 2 Is there a tasklist equivalent that works for Windows XP Home emp

Negative 69721 pAs the title says, Im trying to get an automated release job working on Hudson.  Its a Maven project, and all the code is in Git.  Manually, I do the release on my personal machine like sop  precodegit checkout master mvn B releaseprepare releaseperform codepre  pThis works perfectly.  The Maven release plugin properly pushes the release tag to the origin repository as well as the next commit that bumps the version to the next SNAPSHOT.p  pHowever, when I run this same Maven job through Hudson either by creating my own release job or by using the a hrefhttpwiki.hudsonci.orgdisplayHUDSONM2ReleasePluginM2 Release Plugina it doesnt work so well.  The release tag gets pushed out to the origin repository, and the release gets pushed out to our Nexus repository, but the subsequent commit that bumps the version to the next SNAPSHOT doesnt go out.  Furthermore, the master branch in the origin repository doesnt get changed at all.  Ive looked in Hudsons workspace for the job, however, and the version has been updated.p  pAfter looking at the output from the Hudson job, it appears that the Git plugin does not actually checkout master, but rather its SHA1 id.  That is, if the master branch label points to commit f6af76f541f1a1719e9835cdb46a183095af6861, Hudson doesp  precodegit checkout f f6af76f541f1a1719e9835cdb46a183095af6861 codepre  pinstead ofp  precodegit checkout f master codepre  pAs a result, the changes that the Maven release plugin is making are not actually on any branch certainly not on master and these changes dont make it to the origin repository.  It runs on the right code, but bookkeepingwise, the changes seem to get lost because no branch label points to them.p  pHas anybody gotten the Hudson  Git  Maven Release Plugin combo to work properly  Is there some additional configuration somewhere I can set to make this happen  Or is this a bug in the Hudson Git pluginp  pThanks in advance.p

This prevents concurrent access... but Im not sure what other sideeffects would occur if I use it, also I want to avoid the following situationp  pSuppose trigger times would be every minute, i.e. trigger0  at time 0, trigger 1  60000msec, 2  120000, 3  180000, etc. and the trigger0 at time 0 fires my job which takes 130000msec. With a plain Job, this would execute triggers 1 and 2 while job trigger 0 is still running. With a StatefulJob, this would execute triggers 1 and 2 in order, immediately after 0 finishes at 130000. I dont want that, I want 1 and 2 not to run and the next trigger that runs a job should take place at 3 180000msec. So I still have to do something else with StatefulJob to get it to work the way I want, so I dont see much of an advantage to using it.pli lipUse a a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.orgdocsapiorgquartzTriggerListener.htmlTriggerListenera to return true from vetoJobExecution.p  pAlthough implementing the interface seems straightforward, I have to figure out how to setup one instance of a TriggerListener declaratively. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2676514quartzdocumentationforxmlfilesCant find the docs for the xml filea.pli lipUse a codestaticcode shared threadsafe object e.g. a semaphore or whatever owned by my class that implements Job.p  pI dont like the idea of using singletons via the codestaticcode keyword under TomcatQuartz, not sure if there are side effects. Also I really dont want them to be true singletons, just something that is associated with a particular job definition.pli lipImplement my own a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.orgdocsapiorgquartzTrigger.htmlTriggera which extends a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.orgdocsapiorgquartzSimpleTrigger.htmlSimpleTriggera and contains shared state that could run its own TriggerListener.p  pAgain, I dont know how to setup the XML file to use this trigger rather than the standard codelttriggergtltsimplegt...ltsimplegtlttriggergtcode.pli ol

Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pHeres the XAML that runs it allp  precodeltWindow xClassWpfApplication1.Window1 xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml TitleWindow1 Height300 Width300gt ltGridgt     ltListBox NamelstBox              Width200              ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityDisabled              ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityDisabledgt         ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt                 ltWrapPanelgtltWrapPanelgt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt         ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt          ltListBox.Resourcesgt             ltStyle TargetTypexType ListBoxItemgt                 ltSetter PropertyHorizontalAlignment ValueCenter gt                 ltSetter PropertyFontSize Value12 gt                 ltSetter PropertyLayoutTransformgt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                         ltScaleTransform                     ScaleYBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource self,                                      PathScaleX gt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt                 ltStyle.Triggersgt                     ltEventTrigger RoutedEventButton.MouseEntergt                         ltBeginStoryboardgt                             ltStoryboardgt                                 ltDoubleAnimation                              Storyboard.TargetPropertyLayoutTransform.ScaleX                             To2 Duration000.25 gt                             ltStoryboardgt                         ltBeginStoryboardgt                     ltEventTriggergt                     ltEventTrigger RoutedEventButton.MouseLeavegt                         ltBeginStoryboardgt                             ltStoryboardgt                                 ltDoubleAnimation                              Storyboard.TargetPropertyLayoutTransform.ScaleX                             To1 Duration00.5 gt                             ltStoryboardgt                         ltBeginStoryboardgt                     ltEventTriggergt                 ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltStylegt         ltListBox.Resourcesgt          ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt         ltListBoxItemgt             ltRectangle FillRed Width30 Height20gtltRectanglegt         ltListBoxItemgt     ltListBoxgt ltGridgt codepre  pp

Negative 69721 pWhen I create entities in a class library, I tend to add a codeTagcode property which may be used by users and extending libraries to store arbitrary data with the object. Now I am looking for the best way to implement such a codeTagcode property in my class library, and the reasons why.p  pIn System.Windows.Forms, Microsoft uses codeobject Tag  get set code as the signature, but it looks too limiting as only one may use the Tag at any time.p  pI also thought about codeHashTable Tag  get code to allow anyone to set and retrieve any data by key, but it seems too exposing for a class library. Then codeIDictionary Tag  get code would be a better option, but both allow anyone to clear the entire dictionary which I want to avoid. Then again, both HashTable and IDictionary only allow you to work with codeobjectcode instances, where something generic may be a better choice. But codeDictionaryltgt Tag  get code is obviously not going to work for all possible consumers.p  pSo, which way to gop  pEdit As Timwi below correctly suggested, I dont want different user classes to be able to interfere with eachother. I assume a scenario where there are many entity classes and only a few classes which want to store associated data.p

Ive written the  small example below that appears to work, but it leaves me with an unsettled feeling.  p  ol lipShould I really be using WriteLine, ReadLine  As its written now, is it possible that the code in the event handler  mportDataReceived is going to be called for each and every byte  That was my understanding of the event DataReceived perhaps Im wrong.  Does ReadLine block until it sees an end of line characterpli lipShould I somehow use the if e.EventType  SerialData.Eof construct in the event handler  You can see I have it commented out.  I tried it and could not get it to work.  When would one expect a SerialData.Eof  My idea was that I could wait before all bytes were present before calling ReadExisting.  However, the if statement never evaluated to true.  Force the code to go to ReadExisting did correctly read all the bytes however.pli lipIn general, whats the best way to set up my code to receive bytes coming over the serial port  The sender will be sending small chunks of bytes every 125 msecs, but will not be sending special characters.  The packets of bytes are spaced out in time, so I dont think theres a problem of mixing packets together.  More the problem is, once you see one byte, go read everything, as long as you wait a very short time, youll get everything.  Given this scenario, is there a preferred waypli ol  pThanks in advance, Davep  precodepublic class SerialPortController      SerialPort mport      public SerialPortControllerbool server                if server                      mport  new SerialPortCOM4              mport.BaudRate  115200             mport.Open             byte[] sillyBytes  new byte[]  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7              ASCIIEncoding encoding  new ASCIIEncoding             string outputstring  encoding.GetStringsillyBytes             mport.WriteLineoutputstring             mport.WritesillyBytes, 0, 8                                    else                      mport  new SerialPortCOM5          mport.DataReceived  new SerialDataReceivedEventHandlermportDataReceived             mport.BaudRate  115200             mport.Open                  int character  Console.Read           void mportDataReceivedobject sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e              if e.EventType  SerialData.Eof                      string answer  mport.ReadExisting             string answer  mport.ReadLine             ASCIIEncoding encoding  new ASCIIEncoding             byte[] byteanswer  encoding.GetBytesanswer                 codepre

Negative 69721 pI am having an issue using the QDevelop, Qt IDE Qt version 4.6.2 in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Lucid Lynx. The code I am trying to work with was transfered from a newer 64bit laptop to my 32 bit laptop. Both systems are running the same version of Ubuntu and Qt IDE. When I try building the code I get a long list of errors, which I dont really want to post here but I will at the end of my text. Any help would be greatly appreciated. For whatever reason, my blocks of text are getting cut off. I am using the lt preinsert text herelt slashpre white space retainer trick, what am I doing wrong Ok my build chunk of text is not being formatted properly using the pre slashpre html thingies.. The formating of this post is getting all messed up p  pEmail I sent my collegep  pre I installed the 32bit version of qwt5.2.1 and it still isnt building, I get the same errors.   Attached are my .pro and make files as well as buildoutput.txt showing the results of my build.  See if you see anything wrong with any of the information below  Checking paths  In the myPico.pro file there is a line LIBS  Lusrlocalqwt5.2.1lib lqwtqt4 This is 32bit, I found you can type file then space and a file name, it will give you information about the file including if its 32bit or 64bit. See note below.  Inside usrlocalqwt5.2.1lib I have three items that are teal libqwt.so, libqwt.so.5 and libqwt.so.5.2 and one green item libqwt.so.5.2.1. They all point to libqwt.so.5.2.1 and its 32bit.  Inside the Makefile, the line INCPATH everything seems ok, but I dont understand the last part of the line Iusrincludeqt4 Ibuild  Ibuild When I go to usrincludeqt4 I dont see anything that says build. Could this be an issue  In searching the web for solutions I see a lot of people having the same issue but their solutions are crypticBandAid short cuts.  Note I thought of a possible issue. You had me copy the libs from your system and then we found out they were 64 bit. I installed the 32 bit ones but I dont know if that removed what we copied manually. So I am trying to figure out where we copied those libs to. Ok I found it usrlocalqwt5.2.1lib and theyre 32 bit, so installing the 32 bit overwrote the 64bit versions. pre  p.pro filep  pre TEMPLATE  app QT  gui core CONFIG  qt warnon console debug DESTDIR  bin OBJECTSDIR  build MOCDIR  build UIDIR  build FORMS  uimainwindow.ui HEADERS  srcmainwindowimpl.h srcpicofunctions.h srcThread.h SOURCES  srcmainwindowimpl.cpp srcmain.cpp srcpicofunctions.cpp srcThread.cpp LIBS  Lusrlocalqwt5.2.1lib lqwtqt4 pre  pMakefilep     Makefile for building binmyPico  Generated by qmake 2.01a Qt 4.6.2 on Mon Nov 22 105619 2010  Project  myPico.pro  Template app  Command usrbinqmakeqt4 unix o Makefile myPico.pro    Compiler, tools and options  CC             gcc CXX            g DEFINES        DQTGUILIB DQTCORELIB DQTSHARED CFLAGS         pipe g Wall W DREENTRANT DEFINES CXXFLAGS       pipe g Wall W DREENTRANT DEFINES INCPATH        Iusrshareqt4mkspecslinuxg I.

All UML tools Ive seen are not really practical except this onep  pa hrefhttpwww.intrinsarc.com relnofollowhttpwww.intrinsarc.comap  precodeA hierarchical component model with full connectors At the heart of Evolve is a hierarchical component model with full connectors. Connectors act like wires between components, making it simple and intuitive to express detailed structures that are dicult or impossible in other approaches such as dependency injection. Resemblance and evolution These two constructs provide unprecedented levels of support for component reuse.   Resemblance     is a form of component inheritance. Evolution builds on this to allow the structure of an existing     system to be remodeled, without destroying the original denition. These facilities can be used to     create variants of a system, or to switch in test components. codepre  pDid someone try it  what do you think  It seems like based on UML but not on UML class but other types of diagrams. p  pAny other tool which can do real code generation UML or not p  pWhat I mean by real EMF is not such a tool its only a framework for building UML Tool as far as I can see not a tool by itself which facilitates the building and maintenance of an application.p  pSame for Visual Studio Ultimate.

What kind of interfaces could the worker implementwhat could the boss do to find outp  pstrongways to solve it that I can think ofstrongp  pI found this two ways, but there probably are otherampbetter waysp  p1 we make an class for every task type implementing the empty task interface give the worker an executetask function in the implementation of executetask try to typecheckcast task to all tasktypes that type of worker can perform. If none of the typechecks pass, we throw a taskNotSupportedException. the boss can now give tasks to workers until no exception is thrown.p  p2 we now do not have task classes but define an capability interface for every task type with the function dotaskTypetaskinfo a worker implementation can now implement capability interfaces dependant of what its capabilities are. the boss now can check until a worker with the proper capability is found typechecking and then give him the task knowing he can execute it.p  pI did not test 2 and I do not have that much experience in java but this should be possible or something very similar.p  pI also prefer 2 over 1, because 1 seems improper cascade of casts and interfaces are a natural way to define what an instance of a class can do, also with interfaces you could group capabilitiescreate hierarchies. also in my current implementation 1 the Task interface is empty, so tasks do not have much in common and info is passed through the constructor which would be parameters of functions in method 2 and retrieved by gets.p  pI was wondering in what other way you wouldcould implement adjusting 1 or 2 this or which of the two you prefer and why. efficiency is not important, modulationabstractionmaintainability isp

Negative 69721 pIm having some trouble achieving my desired effect in an OpenGL ES app Im working on. I can use OpenGL ES 1.1 or 2.0. What Im trying to achieve is the following...p  pIn a 2D ortho scene black clear color, render a red square to the screen with some transparency so it is a darker red or just set to darker red color. This is no problem for me. Then, when a user clicks in the region of the square, I want it to quickly flash in a bright flash of light just in the region of the square. This flash doesnt have to persist long at all, just enough that if the user was in a completely dark room, this flash of light would create a brief noticeable flash in the users face. Ive been having some trouble getting a light bloom or glow effect to work efficiently, and was wondering if anyone had ideas for a quick, efficient way to make the color flash brightly for a split second. Possibly through the use of some kind of texturing trick that I dont know of. Also, the flash doesnt have to blur outside of the region, it can be fully contained within the region with sharp edges. Really all Im after is the aesthetic of the flash lighting the immediate area around the screen.p

Negative 69721 pI have a two part question concerning Android.

Meaning, the root node would generate the first options in the list view. As you click on the items corresponding with the nodes, a new listview will be generated based on what that subnode contains. Its basically using listviews to browse through an xml file.p  pThanks for your help I am sort of new to Android and Java so please dont assume I know that much  p

Negative 69721 pI have a codeUITableViewControllercode that Id like to notify once the data of the corresponding model is ready to be displayed. The problem is that this data is fetched from a web service and the request can take up to several seconds. Currently, Im fetching the data synchronously on the main thread which, of course, causes my main thread to block. Now, I dont want my controller to know anything about downloading data from the internet. How can I accomplish this. Currently, Im thinking about utilizing GCD and implementing a method like codeloadDataWithCallbackcode and provide a callback that triggers a code[tableView reloadData]code on success. Is this a good approach Are there other possibilities to notify a controller that the model is ready An other idea I had was to use a delegate mechanism and setting the controller as a delegate of my modelp  pTo summarize, whats better GCD with callbacks or implementing your own delegate mechanismp  pAre there other possibilitiesp  hr  pemUpdateem June, 24th 2011 1315 CETp  pAfter reading all your replies, I come to the conclusion that there are 3 possible solutions to my problemp  ol lipMake use of codeNSNotificationscode and use codeNSURLConnectioncode to implement async. downloadpli lipImplement a custom protocol and use a delegation mechanism. Again, use codeNSURLConnectioncode to implement async. download.pli lipUse synchronous download in a separate GCD queue and use callbacks.pli ol  pSince nobody favors the last solution, I want to discuss this approach a little in depth. After seeing all the code that is involved in notification handling, I think that GCD is a better approach. Instead of agreeing on a certain notification which has to be somehow documented, so that every developer knows about it, I can simply use a callback. On the one hand, it gives me a clear interface like one I would have when I would use a delegate, on the other hand, it give me total flexibility. Do you really think that GCD is to complicated for this Here is my codep  precode voidloadRestaurantsWithCallbackvoid callback      dispatchqueuet currentqueue  dispatchgetcurrentqueue     dispatchqueuet downloadqueue  dispatchqueuecreateDownload queue, NULL      dispatchasyncdownloadqueue,          self.restaurants  [self loadRestaurants]         dispatchasynccurrentqueue,  callback            dispatchreleasedownloadqueue  codepre  pBtw., my application simply displays the menus of the different canteens at my university.p  pIn my controller, I simply do the followingp  precodeif [self.canteen hasRestaurants]      [self.canteen loadRestaurantsWithCallback         [self.tableView reloadData]     ]  codepre  pIt works like a charm.

Negative 69721 pstrongEDITstrong emThe problem described below was due to a very peculiar device issue not caused by any codingrelated problem.emp  pI have a preferenceActivity in which I have many checkBoxPreferences.

If I close the app and open it back up, my values remain like they are suppose to, but if I use task manager to end the app or if I power cycle the phone when the app is not running then the defaultValues are called again.p  pSo, I created a SharedPreference in my onResume to test it.p  precodeSharedPreferences pref  PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencesgetApplicationContext codepre  pI then check to see if there is a key in that sharedpreference.p  precodepref.containsmyCheckBoxPreference codepre  pWhen I close out and open it back up, it returns true. if I close with the task manager or power cycle the phone off and on, then that returns false.p  pSo, I tried manually setting the SharedPreferencep  precodeSharedPreferences.Editor editor  pref.edit editor.putBooleanmyCheckBoxPreference, myCheckBoxPreference.isChecked editor.commit codepre  pand then I called that when the checkboxpreference value changed. I also tried calling it in onStop and onPause.

Negative 69721 pFirst of all, some backgroundp  pMy software which is written in VC relies on some large third party DLLs that get loaded along with my app. These libs often raise Floating point exceptions during their normal course of operation, but they are not signaled as hardware exceptions because of the default configuration of Floating point Control word to mask these exceptions and hence the program does not crash because of these.p  pNow the issue is that when some third party programs like strongZeallsoft Super Screen Capturestrong inject their own DLLs which are written in Borland C, they set the FP Control Word to enable the Floating point exceptions and my app crashes because of that.p  pWhile the main issue might be with the third party lib and the third party software that is injecting its own Dlls, I still want to protect my software from crashing because of such an issue.p  pThe solution that I can think of is to some how get notification of Dll loads happening inside my process and ensure that the FP control word is reset to default value after the dll load happens.p  pSo I am looking for simple and effective ways to achieve that. Is there some way to get notified of Dll loads happening in my process Are there any other way of achieving what I want to do The only thing that I want to be wary of is that the method should work on Win 2k and WinXP and higher and secondly the method used should not be of a nature that can potentially trigger the malware heuristics of Antivirusspyware scanners.p

My understanding is that if I have a nonconst variable and a const reference to that same variable and then modify the nonconst variable, the reference should reflect that modification.p  pExamplep  precodevoid foo      int x  5     const intamp y  x     x  10     stdcout ltlt x   ltlt x ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt y   ltlt y ltlt stdendl  codepre  pproduces the following output for mep  precodex  10 y  10 codepre  pHowever, if I change the type to stdstring, the const reference doesnt seem to reflect the modified variablep  precodevoid foo      stdstring x  abc     const stdstringamp y  x     x  xyz     stdcout ltlt x   ltlt x ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt y   ltlt y ltlt stdendl  codepre  pproduces the following for mep  precodex  xyz y  abc codepre  pIs this the normal expected behavior when attempting this with stdstring Im using GCC 4.6.0 I dont have any other compiler available at the moment, so I dont know if this is only happening with this specific version or not.p

For examplep  precodeselect  from vASSETLOCATION where [WHEN] between 20080101 and 20080102 codepre  pIn this case the view should ONLY ACCESS the AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION tablep  precodeselect  from vASSETLOCATION where [WHEN] between 20081229 and 20090105 codepre  pIn this case the view should access AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION and AVL2009.ASSETLOCATIONp  precodeselect  from vASSETLOCATION where      [WHEN] between 20080101 and 20080101 or      [WHEN]  getdate codepre  pIn this case the view should access AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION and strongAVL.ASSETLOCATIONstrongp  pI know a table scalar UDF in place of the view will solve the problem, but there are more than only 4 fields and [WHEN] is not the only field we may want to include in the where part.  Before anyone suggest it, the table partitioning feature will perhaps help in performance, but NOT in the backup problem.p  pIf there a way to do this in a view Thanks.p

Negative 69721 pThis is one of those questions that seems to fall into the naively obvious but probably wrong category. Certainly, Im struggling to find a solution that works in all corner cases. It seems like this must be a problem that is encountered all the time.p  pI have a hardware thread and a processing thread.p  pThe hardware thread is run in a closed binary library that I dont have access to.p  pThe processing thread registers a callback with the hardware thread to be notified of certain rare events related to state changes in the hardware.p  pI wish to be able to notify the event loop in the processing thread that the state has changed. Id like to do this without requiring a dependance on an external library or in a non portable way, and without using locks as I have no idea when the hardware thread may want to notify the processing thread again.p  pSo, my thinking at present as to how to solve this is something like as followsp  precodeinclude ltsignal.hgt   sigatomict is used so update is always in a sane state static volatile sigatomict update  0   called from hardware thread int callbackfunction      update  1    called regularly from processing thread int processingfunction      static sigatomict localupdate  0  The same type as update      if localupdate  update         updateinternalhardwarestate  We necessarily call once per callback         localupdate  1       codepre  pClearly this is going to break if ever codeupdatecode wraps around and just happens to reach the value of codelocalupdatecode before codeprocessingfunctioncode is next called though almost certainly I can assume this will never happen.p  pHave I missed something subtle or not so subtle herep  pIs there a better way to solve this whole problemp  pThe callback can be assumed to be only ever called from one thread the hardware thread.p

Curve 4s array pointer still points to the same location as before, but the memory has been deallocated and the array contains garbage.p  pCan anyone suggest why curve 4 is being messed withp  pN.b. 1 There is a copy constructor for the curve class, which does a deep copy.

Now the correct item seems to be being erased from the vector, but the wrong destructor is still being called However, when the debugger returns to the array curve 4 is still intact.p

Negative 69721 pI may have come up with an incredibly crude way to get this sort of thing accomplished, but I figured that Id ask the many experts present here at SO.

Each of these bugs are going to be displayed on my web application, but I allow the user to select how they will be grouped either by status, project, or area. Depending upon which of the three they select from a select box above, I want to be able to sort through all of the bugs and group them by whichever category they chose. Then, when it comes to displaying them, have a simple header for each present option for that category. For example, if they were to sort by status, it would be something likep  precodeGroup By Status  Active  Bug with status active Bug with status active Bug with status active  Resolved  Bug with status resolved Bug with status resolved codepre  pShould I iterate through the entire array of bugs and, based on the category to sort by, simply create a new array for each possible option of that category and add the appropriate bugs to them So in the case above, create new arrays codevar activeBugs  []code and codevar resolvedBugs  []code If so, my problem would then be knowing what possible options there are. Should I then first iterate through the entire bugs array to see what possible options are present for the desire group category before creating these new arraysp  pWhats the best way to do this without resorting to other jQuery pluginsp

This works fine for exefiles, but .NET DLLs also have a revision field in the  stream which is much harder to access. Id have to parse all headers which seems quite tedious and Id be happy if I could avoid doing that.p  pNow Im thinking about just ignoring the whole  stream. Can I do this and still be sure the files are equivalent It feels like a waste of time to read in all headers when I just need the address of one field. If i cannot do this, could you suggest other less timeconsuming solutionsp  pCould add that Im programming in C.p
Negative 69721 pI have a file uploading site which is currently resting on a single server i.e using the same server for users to upload the files to and the same server for content delivery.p  pWhat I want to implement is a CDN a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiContentdeliverynetwork relnofollowcontent delivery networka.

Negative 69721 pI apologise if this is on the wrong StackExchange site. I suppose it could go to Apple SE, but Im more interested in the intricacies of code.icalcode files, not the app itself as I want to parse the files with PHP.p  pIm writing a web app with a calendar feature. It needs to load code.icalcode files and display appointments grouped into half hour slots.p  pstrongDo code.icalcode files support multiple events at the same timestrong When it comes to writing code to add events, the start time will be rounded to the nearest 30 minutes, so two events could have the same start time. Is this permitted in code.icalcode files, as well as being parsed properly by PHP parsers Im only really interested in iCal files of the recent or most popular versions.p  pIm guessing the answer is yes, seeing as events have their own codeDTSTAMPcode, codeDTSTARTcode and codeDTENDcode properties, but I want to be sure that a parser in PHP can cope with this.p

Negative 69721 pIm currently porting one of my projects to GCC, and Im using the MinGWw64 project to accomplish this as I require both x64 and x86 support.p  pIve hit a problem in setting up my build environment though. My project currently uses the Boost C libraries, and to make the build process easier I use Boost.Build in my project too as it makes integration simple.p  pUnder MSVC this is fine, because I can do the following from the command linep  precodeb2 toolsetmsvc addressmodel32  compile as 32bit b2 toolsetmsvc addressmodel64  compile as 64bit codepre  pMinGWw64 is making this problematic, as the 32bit and 64bit toolchains are housed in separate directories.

Ideally I would like it to be as easy as it is for MSVC, though I understand this may not be possible. In the worst case I assume what I just suggested would work, and I would just have to add scripts to correctly set the PATH before invoking Boost.Build. That would mean hardcoding a path though, which I dont want to do...p
Negative 69721 pThe code below is just an experiment to see what happens when codeforkIOcode is called to test GHC lightweight thread overhead  both memory overhead and effect of contention for MVar with a function that just reads and writes codeMVarcode. I am aware there are going to be access contention when there are 1 million threads waiting for MVar access  but since each function accesses it only once, all of them should run through eventually. What I am seeing in my tests is that if I compile the code with codethreadedcode option GHC 7.0.3, Mac, x8664, the code slows down a lot  by a factor of 110. I will appreciate pointers into the cause of slowdown in the code with codethreadedcode option.p  precode LANGUAGE BangPatterns  import Control.Concurrent forkIO, MVar, newEmptyMVar, putMVar, takeMVar import qualified Data.Vector.Storable.Mutable as MSV import Control.Monad.Primitive PrimState import Control.Monad mapM  f   MVar Int gt IO  f m   do             i lt takeMVar m             putMVar m i1  main  do   m lt newEmptyMVar   putMVar m 0   let l  1000000   mapM x gt forkIO  f m [1..l] codepre  pWhen compiled with codeghc O2 rtsoptscodep  precode .test RTS s     1,070,652,216 bytes allocated in the heap    1,023,908,744 bytes copied during GC            1,872 bytes maximum residency 1 samples          177,328 bytes maximum slop                9 MB total memory in use 0 MB lost due to fragmentation    Generation 0  2029 collections,     0 parallel,  0.13s,  0.13s elapsed   Generation 1     1 collections,     0 parallel,  0.00s,  0.00s elapsed    INIT  time    0.00s    0.00s elapsed   MUT   time    0.08s    0.08s elapsed   GC    time    0.13s    0.13s elapsed   EXIT  time    0.00s    0.00s elapsed   Total time    0.21s    0.22s elapsed    GC time      61.9  61.7 elapsed    Alloc rate    13,110,134,156 bytes per MUT second    Productivity  37.9 of total user, 37.2 of total elapsed codepre  pWhen compiled with codeghc O2 rtsopts threadedcode I used codeN3code for quadcore imacp  precode.test RTS s N3     1,096,608,080 bytes allocated in the heap    2,713,129,232 bytes copied during GC      761,160,288 bytes maximum residency 10 samples      711,798,176 bytes maximum slop             2424 MB total memory in use 0 MB lost due to fragmentation    Generation 0  1177 collections,  1176 parallel, 46.51s, 15.93s elapsed   Generation 1    10 collections,    10 parallel,  9.35s,  5.60s elapsed    Parallel GC work balance 1.05 339027672  323162843, ideal 3                          MUT time elapsed       GC time  elapsed   Task  0 worker     0.00s      0.00s       0.00s      0.00s   Task  1 worker    56.95s      1.49s       0.26s      0.09s   Task  2 worker    57.05s      1.49s       0.16s      0.05s   Task  3 bound      1.49s      1.23s      55.27s     21.33s   Task  4 worker    57.20s      1.49s       0.00s      0.00s   Task  5 worker    57.03s      1.49s       0.18s      0.06s    SPARKS 0 0 converted, 0 pruned    INIT  time    0.00s    0.00s elapsed   MUT   time    0.90s    1.23s elapsed   GC    time   55.86s   21.53s elapsed   EXIT  time    0.45s    0.40s elapsed   Total time   57.21s   23.02s elapsed    GC time      97.6  93.5 elapsed    Alloc rate    811,808,581 bytes per MUT second    Productivity   2.4 of total user, 5.9 of total elapsed  gcallocblocksync 19789 whiteholespin 73 gen[0].synclargeobjects 0 gen[1].synclargeobjects 0 codepre  pAs you can see above, the total memory in use goes up from 9MB to 2GB in codethreadedcode mode. Total memory allocated on the heap in both cases is within 1. I suspect most of the resident memory overhead comes from forking the function since each function instance on heap has to be a thunk. Since I havent used any of the par strategies, there are no sparks.p  pI wrote this code because I am curious about the behavior with and without codethreadedcode mode, not because I plan to use it that way. Basically, I am teaching myself what happens if you write a bad code like that. So, you dont have to say dont write that way p  pstrongEDIT 1strong ehird pointed out in the comment to check that codethreadedcode runtime itself isnt contributing to slowdown. Threaded runtime doesnt seem to contribute to slowdown  compiling with codethreadedcode option doesnt change the performance. The slowdown happens only when codeRTS Ncode option is used at runtime.p

Negative 69721 pI used to be able to access my localhost through my wampserver but not anymore. It just opens up a blank page in every browser that keeps on loading. I did some research and noticed this problem usually occurs when a program using port 80 such as Skype is interfering. Well I do have skype but I unchecked the use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections option so thats not it. I even typed netstat in the cmd screen to check which program could be using port 80 but its open so I suspect the problem to be elsewhere. Besides, even after editing httpd.conf and swapping my port to 8080 it still does nothing and yes I surfed to localhost8080. I dont think my hosts file is to blame either. It clearly says 127.0.0.1 localhost and theres no hash tag in front of it. I already reinstalled my wampserver and even tried xampp but no dice. Can anyone please tell me if Im missing something.

Heres an examplep  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecode[     0.0,   Relative max amplitude of first second of audio clip 0     0.04,   Relative max amplitude of second second of audio clip 4     0.15,   Relative max amplitude of third second of audio clip 15      Some more     1.0,   The highest amplitude of the whole audio clip will be 1.0 100 ] codepre  pI assume Ill have to use at least codenumpycode and Pythons codewavecode module, but Im not sure how to get the data I want. Id like to use Python but Im not completely against using some kind of commandline tool.p
Negative 69721 pI have been doing several hours of research on a topic that I thought wouldve been very trivial.  So far Ive come up empty handed and wanted to see what you guys think.  Im currently messing with XNA which is actually quite irrelevant now that I think about it building a clientserver architecture for a game project.  Really nothing more than playing around with networking, animations, etc.p  pAnyway Ive read quite a bit about the differences between Synchronous and Asynchronous networks and the viability of threading synchronous applications to simulate asynchronous behavior and have decided to do just that.  Now I know my code isnt pretty but Im just testing right now.  Heres how its sort of set upp  pGame is run in the main thread. On initializationConnect to server. Send x position of player classs sprite object to server. Server receives, acknowledges with a print to console and sends the same data back. Data is read into a logfile.p  pIve begun work on a messenger class that will eventually read or sniff the packets coming from the server and dispatch them accordingly making drawupdate calls as needed.  My problem is that I cant figure out how to properly thread the connection method to have that run and then block separate from the SendReceive loop or what Id like to be a continuous loop.p  pLike I said Im no expert, Im just doing this for fun so I may be all over the place.

Negative 69721 pI have been looking for a solution for this for a little while and non of the stuff Ive found quite matches. It is great that C has a built in serialization library but that is not quite what I am looking for. I need to serialize objects in such a way that I can serialize them, append header data to the packet ie. ID number, timestamp, object type etc. and then be able to send it out without having to keep in mind the platform I am sending it to. In other words, I should be able to unwrap my packet in C or in Java without much more knowledge than what object type I am casting into and the order of header data. The binary formatter in C creates a problem because it is designed to be deserialized on the other end using the same library. It also creates bloated packets which I would rather not have to deal with. I would rather format my packet as suchp  pp  p packetID  datatype  timeStamp  etc  serializedObject p  pp  pIt would be nice if I had access to something along the lines of memcpy in order to achieve this because then  as long as the data type order of the object being deserialized into matches Yes, assuming the other language has the same byte sizes for datatypes, it is easy to grab data from the server on a new platform say I want to grab data of an Android Java or an iPhone obj. C with little hassle p

Negative 69721 pI am having some problems designing a schema for dynamic properties with versioning. Assume the following use casep  pI have a table called codeActorcode which contains the codeidcode and a codenamecode to keep it simple. The upper bound for my case would be, that this table contains about 1 million entries.p  pFurther every actor gets properties assigned to them. Because I dont know the properties at that time, I need a table to manage properties. I thought about a codePropertycodetable. The resulting nm relation will be resolved with a table between codeActorcode and codePropertycode containing their primary keys and the property value type.p  pAt the moment this seems pretty easy to handle. With one million entries each having 10 properties, the codeActorPropertycode table would have ten million nodes. I believe with codebtreecode index log2n this should be no problem.p  pNow comes the part I am struggling with. The properties should somehow be tracked. Over time these properties change, but the history should not get lost. Most likely it will be done with a timestamp. Note that multiple properties get updated at the same time. An example would be I take a snapshot of all actors every day, and if something changes, Ill update all changed properties at the same time. This results in 365 timestamps per year.p  pIf I would use another table to manage the versions timestamps and add another foreign key to the codeActorPropertycode table I would get 365  10 million entries. This should be the maximum I would ever get. Most of the time the datasets will be significantly smaller.p  pMy question now is more addressing the performance. I read the following answer about indexes a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1108howdoesdatabaseindexingworkHow does database indexing worka. Is it not awfully slow to query a table with that amount of entries An example query would be First 100 actors with all their properties at a given timestamp idx. Also I feel like the schema Im thinking of is maybe not the best. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas for a schema with more scalabilityp  pBy the way, I am currently also evaluating NoSql approaches, so Id like to concentrate on relational approaches for the time being. My aim is to gather advantages and disadvantages of the different technologies and then have a theoretical schema or model for the described use case. And performance with an optimal model on a relational database is something I seemingly have trouble to evaluate or find.p  pThanksp

I thought datetime was purely naivep  pHow can I get around that If possible avoiding to import other libraries unless standard. I have portability concerns.p

pDepending on the filter that is selected, the appropriate list of data operations, jobs, shifts, or hours will be loaded into panel 1 and the jQuery Overscroll plugin is used to create an IPad scrolling effect.p  pThe problem is in the ShiftsViewModel on the line where the Overscroll plugin is being called. When debugging, I noticed that the plugin isnt doing anything because the container element has no widthheight.  When running the program, the container is updated with the correct data, so it looks like the call to overscroll is running before the data is written to the DOM container by Knockout.p  pSince the overscroll call is inside the ajax callback which runs after data is received, I thought it would be OK. Is Knockout asynchronously updating the DOM  Im not sure where to go from here... Any suggestionsp

Negative 69721 pIm using a codeBlockingCollectioncode to implement a producerconsumer pattern.

The packets arrive sparsely and I would like the polling to be done without using a blocking call to take.p  pIn essence, Im looking for something like a codeBeginTakecode and codeEndTakecode that does not exist in the blocking collection so that I can make use of the internal thread pool in a callback.

This works fine, but still it would be awesome if there was a way to do this without resorting to timers and swapping lambdas around which potentially causes race conditions and is hard to write and understand. I have  solved this also with an own implementation of an async queue, but it would still be awesome if there was a more standard and well tested option.p

Negative 69721 pI am currently working on a Rails 3.2 application in which I have two controllers. One is campaign and the other one is posts. Both of them are having a beforefilter.

After nesting the beforefilter is getting rendered even after passing the except block in Posts controller not to check for user.

Negative 69721 pstrongHow can I write a Rack Middleware to redirect a user to a different subdomain based on the User Agent string I need this to run before RackCache in my rails app, and I also would like this middleware to be able to detect the presence of a cookie.strongp  ul liWe have a mobile optimized site on a subdomain m.domain.com. li liIf a visitor comes to www.domain.com and we recognize the user agent string as a mobile device, and they do not already have a cookie set that says they prefer the full site, then we redirect them to the mobile subdomain. This is currently done in our ApplicationController in a before filter.li ul  pCurrently if we set cache headers in our rails app for the home page, RackCache caches the home page but when a mobile user visits the main www domain, RackCache serves up the cached version of the page without hitting the rest of our rails app, so our mobile redirect is never executed.p  pIt would seem as though I will have to move our mobile redirect solution into middleware that executes before RackCache. For context, here is what our filters look like in our ApplicationControllerp  precodebeforefilter setmobilepreferences beforefilter redirecttomobileifapplicable    def setmobilepreferences   if params[mobilesite]     cookies.deletepreferweb   elsif params[fullsite]     cookies.permanent[preferweb]  1     redirecttofullsite if mobilerequest   end end   before filter def redirecttomobileifapplicable   if mobiledevice ampamp mobilerequest ampamp prefersfullsite     newurl  request.protocol  domainprefixes[mobile]  .                request.hostwithport.gsubdomainprefixes[web].,                  request.fullpath     redirectto newurl and return   end end codepre  pDoes anyone have experience with both caching pages emandem redirecting mobile users to an alternate domain Doesmoving this redirection to middleware before the cache layer seem like the right solutionp  pAny tips, links, suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Negative 69721 pI recently learnt that SunsOracles most recent guidelines say that no Swing methods of any Swing objects, including constructors, must be called outside the EDT.  p  pDoes the same standard of rigour apply to all visual AWT classes too  If not, what  are  the rules for themp  pemstronglateremstrongp  pre Swing and EDT discussion from 2009.p  pa hrefhttpwww.velocityreviews.comforumst707173whydoesjdk16recommendcreatingswingcomponentsontheedt.html relnofollowhttpwww.velocityreviews.comforumst707173whydoesjdk16recommendcreatingswingcomponentsontheedt.htmlap  pquote Besides actual thread safety and associated issues like visibility and synchronization, theres I think a software issue. Swing components often have listeners of some type, and these listeners are designed to execute on the EDT.p  pSince these listeners are asynchronous and respond to events like property changes its possible to have these listeners fire as you construct your GUI. The result is that some listeners are being executed on the EDT as you are constructing in your main thread, and some listeners might be running on some other thread as well because the listener is confused and fires on the wrong thread. The result is a huge unpredictable mess.p  pmaybe they dont know what theyre talking about... but at the moment Im taking a better safe than sorry approach.

Negative 69721 pI am porting an existing game from ios to android using cocos2dx. When the app is paused, eg by clicking the lock button on the device, the App is pausingsleeping just as it should. But when the device is reactivated, and my app shows up again, it freezes for a couple of seconds. What I would like to do, is to show an ingame modal message telling the user that heshe should wait a sec until the game returns from freeze mode. But I simply can make this work. p  pI have tried to show the message, on onPause and on onResume but the message is not shown until the freeze mode is over, and I would like it to be shown the moment the app reappears.p  pHow can I make this work p  pon Ios it is possible to be notified before the app goes to the background.. applicationWillResignActive and I cannot find anything like this on android. Does any notificationdelegate function like preonPause exist on Androidp  pAny idees are appreciated. p  pBestp

Negative 69721 pI am hoping someone can shed some light on this for me, as it has been driving me mad for some time now.p  pI have an application that is trying to read a users feed.

I have set a limit on the results in this example to 2 as the first 2 results in the query are the ones that highlight this issue.

Negative 69721 pIm looking to implement AJAX in this forumstyle site that I run, but recently, while testing it out to get the gist of it, I experienced a weird and potentially devastating loss of data, and was wondering if its something I should be worried about.p  pHeres what happened Im new at AJAX and was testing it out in a simple texteditor app that I created a bit ago.

Negative 69721 pI am running an ApachePHPMySQL server xampp on my local machine under Windows 7. There I have installed the MediaWikiSoftware, together with many extensions. My aim is to download some pages from Wikipedia and show them locally. Everything runs fine, except for one big problemp  pThe image files in the German Wikipedia contain German Umlaute , ,  in their file names. This cannot be changed, because the articles link to the names with the Umlaute.p  pWhen I try to import these images via the codemaintenanceimportImages.phpcode script, it does not work. I traced the code and figured out whyp  pWhen PHP scans the directory for files, it reads the file names as ANSI strings. MediaWiki internally requires that all strings are utf8. So the Umlaut in the file name is interpreted as part of a nonexisting unicode character, which breaks the script.p  pIf I manually add a call to codeutf8encodecode into the script, the name is fine then, and is correctly added to the database. But the file actually written to the images directory has a broken name  two special characters instead of the umlaut. The reason is that the PHP script sends utf8 strings to the filesystem functions copy, ..., but the operating system expects ANSI strings there. I could manually add a call to codeutf8decodecode before each file system call, but there are thousands of themp  pIn short form again The OS works in ANSI this cannot easily be changed for windows and the MediaWiki software inside the PHP Server works in utf8 also cannot be changed. Is there a way to automatically encodedecode file name strings everytime they go intoout of the PHP serverp  pI was already playing around with codembinternalencodingcode and codembhttpoutputcode, but this did not change anything MediaWiki uses hardcoded functions which only work on utf8 strings.p

Negative 69721 pIm writing code which runs in real mode before any OS is loaded.  Part of my program involves a dump of information to the video display, and the standard 80x25 text mode is not cutting it.p  pMany versions of Windows and other OSes seem to have no trouble switching to some larger text mode, 43 line I think, when they show kernel panics.  I know larger text modes have been around a long time so I would expect theres at least one standard mode.p  pTheres a pretty large list of BIOS video modes herep  pa hrefhttpwww.columbia.eduem36wpdosvideomodes.txt relnofollowhttpwww.columbia.eduem36wpdosvideomodes.txtap  pUnfortunately, the same mode numbers seem to vary wildly in meaning between chipsets.p  pOnce upon a time I seem to remember having used a thing called VESA BIOS to access Super VGA graphics modes in a deviceindependent manner, but I also seem to remember that involving a DOS TSR which had to be loaded in.  Thats not an option here as DOS is not running.p  pIm looking for a mode that will work on the widest variety of hardware, including the virtual video adapter in VMware ESXi.  The code to change modes needs to be compact also, so I was hoping a simple Int 10h would do it.p  pAny ideas  How do the Windows amp VMware kernel panics do itp

Negative 69721 pIve got a general question about daemons in C, that I havent seen an answer to by now.p  pIs there a way how one should implement the control of a daemon process, like a convention or standardp  pRest is further explanationp  pI have seen multiple documents teaching the basics how to create a daemon in C. Forking, closing file descriptors, changing root, etc... no problem. And they all stop, when the process enters a endless loop when the daemon process is created  so to say. But this is only half the way when it comes to coding a daemon you have to control it emsomehowem. I can make it work different ways, but I have the feeling there is a lot more to it.p  pFor this checking if there is a process already running or for stopping a running daemon process, or ... I have seen different approaches UNIX sockets, file locks, pidfiles, ... with their pros and cons. But it seemed to me like opinions or personal flavors why dont you just... or Ive done it this way, it worked for me. And I am not sure if this is a sign of freedom or not.p  pI mean, if you take a look at sshd, httpd, syslogd, etc... they all can be controlled via initscripts or the service command startstopstatus. This looks like a standard. But is this just some loose convention a lot of people try to follow or is there some kind of framework in the deep sea of C functions Do you have to make it work emsomehowem  for example make your program respond to a stop argument and end the daemon process emsomehowem Or is there some kind of standard, convention, a UNIXway, best practices... that one should follow to write good, clean code and that integrates well in most environmentsp  pMy main question comes down to Is there a way its meant to be done p  pAnd if so, where could I find more information I guess there is more to take care of, than just starting and stopping.p

It starts off at null no problem, but once it gets a number, how can I reset it back to missingp  pI have triedp  ol licodemyAttribute  nilcodeli licodemyAttribute  [NSNull null]codeli licode[self setValue[NSNull null] forKeymyAttribute]codeli licode[self setPrimitiveValue[NSNull null] forKeymyAttribute]codeli ol  pThe first doesnt crash, but I understand setting a core data attribute to nil is effectively saying it hasnt been fetched. Therefore it doesnt update. The other three crash.p  pA lot of recommendations suggest that codeNSNumbercode should always contain a number, so I am not looking for this to be the answer. To get past this, pretend that I am storing data in an codeNSStringcode. How can I get core data to store codeNULLcode on the database rather than an empty stringp
Negative 69721 pI have a data structure consisting of thousands of medium sized hundreds of byte objects, which each represent a subset of a larger dataset. This isnt optimal for several reasons complexity when analyzing larges scopes, strain on garbage collector, etc.p  pConceptually, you can imagine the objects representing for example meteorological data for a day, when the dataset as a whole is the data for a year say. Trivial examplep  precodeclass YearData     private readonly DayData[] days  new DayData[365]    public DayData GetDayDataint dayNumber           return days[dayNumber]       class DayData     private readonly double[] temperatures  new double[24]    public double GetTemperatureint hour           return temperatures[hour]             public void SetTemperatureint hour, double temperature           temperatures[hour]  temperature             codepre  pIn a refactoring effort I have tried to move the data to a single object representing the whole dataset, but to keep the rest of the code unchanged and simple, I need the objects representing the subsetsegment of data. Examplep  precodeclass YearData     private readonly double[] temperatures  new double[36524]        public DayData GetDayDataint day           return new DayDatathis, day          internal double GetTemperatureint day, int hour           return temperatures[day24  hour]         internal double SetTemperatureint day, int hour, double temperature           temperatures[day24  hour]  temperature       class DayData  or struct      private readonly YearData yearData     private readonly int dayNumber     public DayDataYearData yearData, int dayNumber             this.yearData  yearData        this.dayNumber  dayNumber          public double GetTemperatureint hour             return yearData.GetDatadayNumber, hour          public void SetTemperatureint hour, double temperature             yearData.SetDatadayNumber, hour, temperature       codepre  pThis way I can have a single huge and long lived object, and I can keep many small short lived objects for the analysis of the data. GC is happier and doing analysis directly on the whole dataset is now less complicated.p  pMy questions are, first does this pattern have a name Seems like it should be pretty common pattern.p  pSecond .NET specific The segment object is very lightweight and immutable. Does that make it a good candidate for being a struct Does it matter that one of the struct fields is a reference Is it bad form to use a struct for an type that emappearsem mutable but which in fact isntp

Negative 69721 pIve been trying to find a solution to my issue for the past few days, but really couldnt find it anywhere, and Google literally hates me, so here I am. This is a big request and my conscience is eating at me for asking, but I dont know where else to turn.p  pI am building a gallery for a photographer, and while Im at ease with HTML and CSS, my jQuery skills are taking a beating in short, theyre not good  surprise, surprise.p  pThe task becomes even more complex since its a 100 height kind of gallery, and 100 heights dont play nice. I manage to set some of it up, but its functionality is really impaired.p  pAfter digging here on Stack and Google I found this great PluginFiddle by William Moynihan a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netwdm9548GKz611 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netwdm9548GKz611ap  pIt contains strongexactly my markup and CSSstrong, as well as the functionality I was looking for a slider which centers the main image when sliding, and is infinite.p  pHowever, it doesnt play well with codeheight 100code because of the codewidth autocode property on the images. The following linep  pcodecontent.widthw  section.lengthcodep  pDoesnt appear to calculate the width of the container at all sets it to zero because of the auto property in the CSS. When I set the width via the jQuery .css property to codewidth, autocode, it works fine, but the sliding function is imperfect, causing images to skipjump when moving right and left.p  pI didnt resort to a slider, because this is a nice way to actually have the content layed out, in a horizontal manner, which is something that looks great on a photographers website. And of having codewidth 100code will make the vertical images stretch past the browser window, and the horizontal ones to hang at the top with plenty of white space below. So, I am convinced that codewidth autocode and codeheight 100code is the correct, responsive way to go about it, but if someone manages to unconvince me, I will definitely follow your lead.p  pemWhile Im here, maybe someone could be polite enough to point me in the right direction to make this gallery finite  ending at the start and end of the slider, with the leftright buttons disappearing accordingly.emp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 69721 pI know there have been lots of question about AJAX security. Ive searched and read but am still unclear as to what the best approach is.p  pI have a very specific senariop  pI have an application that is build on top a PHP MVC framework. Ive turned presentation elements such as a navigation menu modular. The navigation menu module has a controller sever side. The controller uses a model to retrieving data from the database and then it responds with a php echo of the data. I can make the http request to the controller using AJAX because the controller is routed to by a URI. I believe this is call a RESTful API. When the user clicks a link in the navigation menu a static content area is update with the data that was retrieved from the AJAX request. Lets say that I Make a different action in the same controller that is capable of writing data to the database. Having a publicly available URI that allows writing to the database is obviously bad. How does one secure the URI interface so that AJAX can retrieve and write data, but those individuals with malicious intent can do harm     p

Negative 69721 pWe are just building a page with using jQuery UI radio buttons and we realized some strange behavior while doing UI testing.p  pSome of the users have problems activing the radio buttons through clicking. Particularly, it turns out that they tend to make a long click like holding the left mouse button for 250 ms and that they are not able to keep the mouse in the exact position within this time. As they move the cursor for one pixel within that time the browsers seems to change to text selection mode. In the end the click event isnt triggered and the button doesnt get selected. Some people needed 56 attempts to get it selected.p  pI was curious and tested this with my dad 60 and it seems that he is somewhat unable to use any site with such buttons in a normal way he is making extremely long clicks  like holding the mouse button down for a full second .p  pI wonder, if anybody had this problem in the past and if there is any solution Can I disable textselection for my buttonsp

Negative 69721 pI have a problem statement. p  pA client of mine has three years of data in very complicated Excel Sheets. They are currently doing data entry, reporting and every thing basically in excel and these excels are shared with each other when ever there is a need to share the data. p  pThey want eventually to move to a web based solution. p  pThe first step of the solution agreed is to make a routine and a database. The routine will import the data from excels into the database. The database itself will need to be designed in such a way that the same database can be used at the back for a web site. p  pThe said routine will be used as a one time activity to import all the data for the last three years and also will be used on periodic basis so that they keep importing the data until the web front is ready or agreed upon. p  pThe defacto method for me is to analyze the excel sheets, make a normalized database, make a service in java that will use poi, read the excel sheets, apply business logic and insert the data into the database. The problem here is that any time they change the excel or even the data format, the routine will need to be rewritten. p  pI am willing to go any way, maybe use an ETL tool.p  pPlease recommend. p

Negative 69721 pI am asking for your input andhelp on a classification problem. If anyone have any references that I can read to help me solve my problem even better.p  pI have a classification problem of four discrete and very well separated classes. However my input is continuous and has a high frequency 50Hz, since its a realtime problem. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combL1BC.png altEqual Weight Decision Boundaryp  pThe circles represent the clusters of the classes, the blue line the decision boundary and Class 5 equals the neutralresting  do nothing class. This class is the rejected class. However the problem is that when I move from one class to the other I activate a lot of false positives in the transition movements, since the movement is clearly nonlinear. For example, every time I move from class 5 neutral class to 1 I first see a lot of 3s before getting to the 1 class.p  pIdeally, I will want my decision boundary to look like the one in the picture below where the rejected class is Class 5. Has a higher decision boundary than the others classes to avoid misclassification during transition. I am currently implementing my algorithm in Matlab using naive bayes, kNN, and SVMs optimized algorithms using Matlab. p  pQuestion What is the bestcommon way to handle abstainrejected classes classes Should I use fuzzy logic, loss function, should I include resting cluster in the trainingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj3YLE.png altIdeal Decision Boundaryp

Negative 69721 pI have app where users photos are private. I store the photosthumbnails also in AWS s3. There is a page in the site where user can view his photosi.e thumbnails. Now my problem is how do I serve these files. Some options that I have evaluated arep  ul liServing files from CloudFrontor AWS using signed url generation. But the problem is every time the user refreshes the page I have to create so many signed urls again and load it. So therefore I wont be able to cache the Images in the browser which would have been a good choice. Is there anyway to do still in javascript I cant have the validity of those urls for longer due to security issues. And secondly within that time frame if someone got hold of that url he can view the file without running through authentication from the app.li liOther option is to serve the file from my express app itself after streaming it from S3 servers. This allows me to have http cache headers, therefore enable browser caching. It also makes sure no can view a file without being authenticated. Ideally I would like to stream the file and a I am hosting using NGINX proxy relay the other side streaming to NGINX. But as i see that can only be posible if the file exist in the same systems files. But here I have to stream it and return when i get the stream is complete. Dont want to store the files locally.li ul  pI am not able to evaluate which of the two options would be a better choice I want to redirect as much work as possible to S3 or cloudfront but even using singed urls also makes the request first to my servers. I also want caching features. p  pSo what would be ideal way to do with the answers for the particular questions pertaining to those methodsp

Negative 69721 pPlease dont close this post due to subjective reasons.br Im developing a formfilling winform application which generates a PDF file on submitting the information. The PDF file need to contain barcodes encoding some information entered by user. The user prints the PDF file and put signature on it and faxes it back to us. I need suggestions for choosing which barcode symbology to use for this applcation. The barcode needs to satisfy the following conditions.p  precode  1The barcode need to encode upto 120 characters codepre  pSince the barcode need to encode a lot of information, I think 2D Barcode would be better as it can store with much high information density.p  precode  2Only upper case alphabets and numbers need to be encoded codepre  pThough most of the 2D barcodes can store more than numbers, there are some 1D barcodes such as code 39 that cannot represent all alphabets.     p  precode  3Preferable size of barcode is 1.5 inch height and 8 inch width codepre  pThis is what is the most challenging requirement. Im planning to place the barcode below the information such as account id. So it would be good if barcode takes the shape of a rectangle whose information capacity increases with its width. This requirement is suitable for 1D barcodes. Also, since 2D barcodes takes the shape of a square, a lot of space will be wasted on either side of barcode. p  precode  4Error correcting capability codepre  p2D barcodes have better error correcting capability. Only some 1D barcodes have error correction with it. This is not an essential requirement.p  precode  5The barcode need to be faxed from one country to another codepre  pThe barcode is generated on a PDF. The PDF will be printed and then need to be faxed. So, the barcode needs to have high resolution. Otherwise, I fear that the scanner cannot decode data correctly. Im thinking a resoltion of 200dpi is enough for the barcode image. Is there any problem to fax 2D barcodes as they need to be scanned both horizontally and verically. I have heard like fax have different resolution vertically and horizontally. Does this create any problem when scanning barcodes.p  precode  6Easiness to program in c to generate barcode codepre  pAtlast but not the least, I need to program this barcode generation myselfin c. So, there should be some free library available for the same. Aspose barcode is a good one. But it is costly. p  pI have come across the following Barcodes. I have checked the specification of some of these types. But couldnt reach a final decision. I cant turn back once I choose a barcode and start programming.p  p1D UPCEANJAN, Code 39, Code 128, Interleaved 2 of 5, Codabar, Code 11, Code 93, NEC 2 of 5, Matrix 2 of 5, Trioptic Code,  Stacked 1D PDF417, Micro PDF417, Codablock A amp F, Composite Codes 2D Data Matrix, QR Code, Micro QR Code, Aztec Code, Maxicodep  pI am thinking of using PDF417.

Negative 69721 pHi I have just now learned Objective C and I am doing some exercises to practice myself.

Below i give a small example.p  precodeinterface mainClass  NSObject static NSArray instanceObj end implementation mainClass  Here i used the designated initializer to initialize and add the instance to the     Array end   interface subClassmainClass end implementation subClass  Here i want to use the Array to get instances of mainClass. end codepre  pIf i do as the above example, I get a warning stating that the static array is not used and when getting data from Array its nil. Also I tried declaring the static array in implementation file of main Class, But i cannot use the Array in Sub Class. Kindly provide me a solution.p  pFriends, Although this question is not that important, It may help me understand things. So please help me understand the concept and I may delete this question completely. Thank youp

When I run test1.html, it does this  the div shows foreign html which is coming from test2.html  however it doesnt execute the alert box. Visiting test2.html directly does display the alert box.p  pSo in other words, I need to grab the contents of a remote webpage, and insert it into a div, AND have its javascript executed. The real test2.html will use jquery, so test1.html cannot use it otherwise Im loading jquery twice.p  pp  pBased on the comments warning me about XSS amp suggesting I change my architecture, Im editing this to elaborate. The goal of this project is a piece of html my users can paste on their sites, this pulls in a bunch of functionality. The functionality they are pulling in involves loading jquery plugins, and HTML. Yes, my users would have to trust me to not XSS attack them. Just like you trust Google not to XSS you when you use Google Analytics. My post isnt asking for security advice. I just want to make this simple hello world type example work. The real application is secure.p  pWhen I used jquery in test1.html, it did cause the JS in test2.html to be executed, but this is just a contrived example which is overly simplified compared to my real app. The real app uses heavy jquery in test2.html  and I need to be able to update test2.html on my server, without giving my users new versions of test1.html. Having test1.html load its own version of jquery is a lot overhead, just to include test2.html.p

Negative 69721 pI know that in UML, composition means that one class basically includes other with lifetime dependency,i.e. when this class is destroyed, the composing class is destroyed as well.

But in this case, isnt sharing of passengers  In reality with modern languages C e.g., if just the Seat holds the reference to passenger,  it will still exist, no matter that the Plane class was destroyed.p

Negative 69721 pI recently developed an MS Access 2010 database and I want to add functionality that tracks the activity of each user. It occurs to me that I can create an codeActivitycode table and then add code to each form which adds a row to the Activity table whenever a user creates, views, edits, or deletes a record in the database.  But how do I do the following  p  precode1. Identify a specific user  Is there a User object so that calling something       like User.getName returns JaneDoe or SallySmith and I can thus store       history for that specific user in the Activity table  What is the syntax       for retrieving the current users username   2. Lock down tables permanently so that only specified forms can create, modify,       or delete records in specific tables.   3. Make sure that the Activity table cannot be edited by anyone other than one       specific administrator account.   codepre  pSo that you can better understand what I mean with the above three questions, the structure of the Activity table might include the following fields  p  precodeid  primary key userName  the name of the user who made the operation tableName  the name of the table that was changed operation  the type of change, such as create, edit, delete rowNumber  the autonumber primary key of the changed field date  the date the change was made codepre  pI might add more extensive logging, but setting things up at this level would enable us to make sure everything works before getting more sophisticated.  p  pCan someone please explain answers to my above three questions  Links to more information in your answers would be very helpful.  p  pIs anything like this already built into MS Access 2010  Or do I have to roll my ownp

Negative 69721 pWe have been working in a development team on an iPhone app, which would act as intermediary between craftsmen of virtual goods and consumers of those goods. p  pFor sake of an example because of emNDAem related restrictions lets assume that the craftsmen in the application are making virtual owlets. These virtual owlets can be either made for general public and purchased from catalog OR be custommade, if user orders it from a specific craftsman. These virtual owlets get used up within a period of one month.p  blockquote   psubstrongNotestrong the virtual owlets in the example are just a placeholder for the digital products, which would be sold to consumers. It is strongnotstrong a physical object.subp blockquote  pThe issue, which we are facing is as follows the virtual owlets should be dynamically added to the catalog at the craftsmans determined price. p  pProblem stems from the fact, that, to add an emInApp Purchaseem, it should be registered for a review by the developer. But in our case the virtual owlets should be added to the catalog ASAP.p  pCurrently the two viable solutions seem to bep  ul liphave InApp Purchases selling packs of virtual currency gems, coins, feathers, but this approach makes the application less usable for the customers and, since the real product will be a quite serious project, such introduction of gamingrelated practice may be harmful.pli liprestrict the craftsmen of virtual owlets to choosing price from a previously specified pool, where user, when buying the virtual product, actually is buying one of several predefined tokens. And then our backend system does the association.pli ul  pQuestionp  ul lipIf we attempt to implement the second approach, would that pass the validation processp  pThe issue that I see there is that the virtual product, which consumer buys, is not actually what heshe can see in the catalog. Could it be that this violates the rules of emInApp Purchasesempli lipIs there any other way in which we could facilitate this type of business modelpli ul  blockquote   psubstrongP.S.strong The virtual products, which craftsmen create, are meant only for use within the application itself.subp blockquote  pAlso, if anyone has a suggestion for a different way to implement such emuserdriven marketem or experience with a similar project, I would love to hear about it.p

Negative 69721 pI am trying display a codeUITableViewcode within a larger codeUIViewcode in an iPad app, mainly because the data is pretty sparse and Id like to have the table be a smaller area over a background image, rather than taking up the whole screen.

The table view doesnt present a UINavigationBar property or any other navigationrelated properties that I can try to nullify. p  pI would post a screen shot but I dont have the rep yet.  p  pCan anyone explain where the space is coming from and how to nix itp

Negative 69721 pIm playing with codepsycopg2code for the first time today, and Im trying to understand how passwords work...

Clearly only one of those lines should work regardless of what the password actually is. As expected, I do get an error if I try a codeuseramos123code, since that user doesnt exist.

Now I tested on a Samsung and it looks like I want.p  pMy question is  defined this way, is the graphical interface going to have the same look with different screens  Or is it going to change depending on the device p  pHere is a part of the code p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidbackgrounddrawablefinalshelves     androidorientationvertical gt      lt First shelf gt     ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheight70dp         androidlayoutmarginLeft70dp         androidlayoutmarginRight65dp         androidlayoutmarginTopdimenfirstshelfmargintop         androidorientationhorizontal gt         ltImageView             androidididcard11             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutgravitybottom             androidlayoutweight1             androidsrcdrawablecard             androidclickabletruegt         ltImageView             androidididcard12             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutgravitybottom             androidlayoutweight1             androidsrcdrawablecard             androidclickabletrue gt         ltImageView             androidididcard12             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutgravitybottom             androidlayoutweight1             androidsrcdrawablecard             androidclickabletrue gt     ltLinearLayoutgt      lt Second shelf gt     ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheight70dp         androidlayoutmarginLeft70dp         androidlayoutmarginRight70dp         androidlayoutmarginTopdimensecondshelfmargintop         androidorientationhorizontal gt         ltImageView             androidididcard21             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutgravitybottom             androidlayoutweight1             androidsrcdrawablecard             androidclickabletrue gt         ltImageView             androidididcard22             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutgravitybottom             androidlayoutweight1             androidsrcdrawablecard             androidclickabletrue gt         ltImageView             androidididcard12             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutgravitybottom             androidlayoutweight1             androidsrcdrawablecard             androidclickabletrue gt     ltLinearLayoutgt codepre
Negative 69721 pA common pattern I end up applying is the one described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15279542howtooverridebothinitwithframeandinitwithcoderinsubclassofuiviewHow to override both initWithFrame and initWithCoder in subclass of UIViewap  pBut I keep spinning wheels obsessing emwhat to nameem said method. Ive used things like codebasicInitializecode and codelocalInitcode and codesharedInitcode. Ive been tempted to just call it codeinitcode which would be evil, but appropriately express my frustration with having to implement the same thing twice even if just via plumbing.p  pIm curious if others have seen any common style of convention for what to name that method Or if youve developed one of your own.p

Negative 69721 pOk so this is kind of complicated. Ive looked high and low, even on Stack and still cant find the answer Im looking for. If someone could walk me through what to do that would be awesome. This is my second time using swing, and I am getting overwhelmed with all of the different JPanels and places info comes from so I dont really know where to start. This is my last resort.p  pSo this is what I am doing. I have a JPanel that has a button on it that says Add Student, it also has a JList on it. If you click on the add student button then another JPanel comes up with multiple text fields on itone for First Name, last, ID, and GPA, and a button that says add student on that panel, I also have a class with setters and getters on it for student for each variable. So I need to somehow take the information in the text fields on JPanel2, click add student, save the information to an object somewhere, save that object in an arraylist somewhere, then display that object on the Jlist on JPanel1. p  pThe picture might help clear things up.p  pPS although this is for homework, the swing stuff isnt apart of the extra credit, I just wanted to do it for extra credit so dont worry about giving away too much info, thanks in advance.[enter image description here][1]p  pwell i guess Im not cool enough to post pictures, sorry, i tiredp  precodeThis is the main screen

Negative 69721 pI have an app Im currently working on where I map out various Point of Interest on a Map. There are 5 different types of POIs and Ive added the ability to filter out by type. I was able to properly implement the clustering of markers, and I also implemented filtering of individual markers by type without any issues, but I cannot figure out how to filter the markers included in a Cluster by type and then get the utility to redraw its clusters. p  pFor filtering the Markers by type, I created my own CustomClusterRenderer and did an override of the onClusterItemRenderedp  precodeOverride protected void onClusterItemRenderedAbstractPOI clusterItem, Marker marker       TODO Autogenerated method stub     super.onClusterItemRenderedclusterItem, marker      if mClusterManager.getMarkerMap.getclusterItem.getPosition  null                     Save a reference to the appropriate filter array by type.                    if MapUtils.TYPEHOTEL.equalsmarker.getSnippet              mClusterManager.getHotelMarkers.addmarker          else if MapUtils.TYPEPARK.equalsmarker.getSnippet              mClusterManager.getParkMarkers.addmarker          else if MapUtils.TYPEPROVIDER.equalsmarker.getSnippet              mClusterManager.getProviderMarkers.addmarker          else if MapUtils.TYPERESTAURANT.equalsmarker.getSnippet              mClusterManager.getRestaurantMarkers.addmarker                              Save this marker to our marker map to prevent duplicates.                    mClusterManager.getMarkerMap.putclusterItem.getPosition, marker       codepre  pThis may end up being problematic if somehow it also means that the markers arent included in clusters created during zooming. Im not sure.

Negative 69721 pWhen creating the backing array for e.g. a collection, you do not really care about the exact size of the array you create, it only needs to be at least as large as you calculated. p  pBut thanks to the memory allocation and the VMs array header, it would in some cases be possible to create a somewhat larger array without consuming any more memory  for the Oracle 32 bit VM at least thats what several sources on the internet claim, memory granularity is 8 meaning any memory allocation is rounded up to the next 8 byteboundary, and array header overhead is 12 bytes.p  pThat means when allocating Object[2], that should consume 20 bytes 12  2  4, but it will actually take 24 bytes thanks to granularity. It would be possible to create an Object[3] for just the same memory cost, meaning a collection would have to resize its backing array a little later. The same principle could be applied to primitve arrays, e.g. byte[] used for IO buffers, char[] in string builder etc.p  pWhile such an optimization wont have a really noticeable effect, except under the most extreme circumstances, it wouldnt be much trouble to call a static method to optimze an array size.p  pProblem is, there is no such round array size up to memory granularity in the JDK. And writing such a method myself would require to determine some crucial parameters of the VM memory granularity, array header overhead and finally the size of each type mainly a problem for references, since their size can vary with architecture and VM options.p  pSo is there a method to determine these parameters, or achieve the desired round up by other meansp

Negative 69721 pOriginally, I am a PHP and consequently a Laravel developer. When I would write for example a simple blog app, I would have these routesp  pcodeblogid gt SingleController blogidedit gt EditController blognew gt NewControllercodep  pAnd because of Laravels form binding, I would use the same template for the creating and editing a blog post, like sop  precode Formmodelpost, arrayroute gt ...          Formlabelname, Name       Formtextname   Formclose  codepre  pWhich is awesome, because Laravel would fill in the text field if it would be executed by the edit controller, and otherwise it would leave the field empty. Of course, the example above is simplified, because changes in actionroute would have to be taken care of too.p  pBut currently, I am working on an AngularJS app first time, and I could not really find any information about the best approach to go about this. Is it advisable to adopt the same method for Angular too, or have I been doing it wrong all alongp  pThe reason why I do it like this is because it makes it easier to change a form you only need to apply your changes to one fileform, instead of two.p

Negative 69721 pUsing Windows 7, Python 3.4, and Django 1.6, using virtualenvp  pHey, all. I tried using djangosecure to force https and ssl on my django project. Then I decided I didnt want it until I actually put the site online, because I didnt have a security certificate, so I couldnt even try out the site on my computer. After removing the djangosecure code from my settings, uninstalling djangosecure using pip, and restarting my computer, any browser I visited the page with while using djangosecure forces https whenever I run that particular django project, but not on other projects. Uninstalling and reinstalling worked for Safari and Firefox, but not for Chrome. I couldnt uninstall Internet Explorer or Opera using the Control Panel, so I thought it might be easier just to change some settings in the browsers, if I knew how to do that. Does anyone know how I can make Chrome not force https on my project and how to do that with Opera and IE without uninstalling themp  pI think the above details could lead to finding the answer, but if you want it, heres my detailed description of what I did in what orderp  pI followed the installation and usage instructions at a hrefhttpsgithub.comcarljmdjangosecure relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcarljmdjangosecurea, up through Set the SECUREHSTSSECONDS setting to an integer number of seconds and SECUREHSTSINCLUDESUBDOMAINS to True, if you want to use HTTP Strict Transport Security. I then tried it out on chrome and found out I needed a security certificate, and decided Id rather wait till I actually put the website online. So I removed the parts of the settings file that I had added following the djangosecure instructions, stopped and restarted my local server, opened it on chrome, and found that it forced https, but only for that particular django project. I then used pip to uninstall djangosecure, but chrome still forced https. I tried it on firefox, ie, opera, and safari, and had no problem. I then restarted my computer, but that didnt solve the problem. So I reinstalled djangosecure using pip, and repeated the steps I had followed from the djangosecure instructions. I then ran it on safari and ie, removed those lines from settings, and reran it, and they continued to force https on that django project. I repeated the process with Opera and Firefox, and had the same problem. Uninstalling and reinstalling Safari and Firefox fixed the problem in those browsers. It didnt fix the problem in Chrome. I couldnt uninstall Opera or IE from the control panel, so I think Ill just wait till I find out another way of fixing the problem.p

Negative 69721 pIm following the book EF Code First by Lerman, and one of the things you do in the book is create a class library project in which you define a class that will inherit from DbContext. For this, you need to install Entity Framework. When you do this, two files will be added App.config and packages.config.p  pThen you add a console project, and use your brand new context class in a using statement. Youll encounter quite some errors, because the Console Project does not have a reference to EntityFramework.dll and EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll, and also because Im not using SQL Server Express, but a full version.p  pNow there are two options. The first is to also install entity framework in the console project. The other option is to reference the two .dlls, by adding a reference and adding them from the recent tab.p  pThe first option will again add the App.config and packages.config files, but this time to the console project.p  pThe second option does not. But trying to run the application will throw an exception, since it is looking for a connection string, and it cant find any. The solution I found is to copy the App.config thats in the class library project over to the console project, and put in a connectionString section in the copied App.config.p  pBut this raises the questionp  pWhich of these files can I remove I seem to be able to remove the packages.config and App.config from the DataAccess project without any troubles. The console project seems to need the App.config.p

Is this an appropriate solution, bad practice or is there a better way to do what i needp  pThanksp

Negative 69721 pIve been looking at several different possible jQuery and ASP.NET MVC components.  Several of the companies seem to host the entire javascript code on their CDN sites.

However, the css and js files needed for the grid are hosted on a cdn site.

Negative 69721 pTrying to select a column of an object of class codegroupeddfcode by index gives Error index out of bounds.

Im not sure whether this is a bug or intentional.. Is there any good reason why it works this way Id rather not have to remember to ungroup my data frames after using codedplyrcode every time...p  pemUpdateem Having looked a bit further into this, my guess is that the motivation for defining code[.groupeddfcode a hrefhttpsgithub.comhadleydplyrblobmasterRgroupeddf.rL63 relnofollowthis waya is for the groups to be preserved when calling e.g. codex[13]code which works. However, when the index is not part of the grouping variables, the error above is thrown. Perhaps it could be modified so that in this case it calls code[.tbldfcode and throws a warning at the same time...p  pemUpdate 2em code[.groupeddfcode has been modified in the development version of dplyr 0.3.0.9000. It still throws an error, but is more clear now, specifying which grouping variables were not included. p  precodex[2]  Error in [.groupeddfx, 2        cannot group, grouping variables am not included codepre  pThe best solution Ive found so that my code doesnt crash in this situation, is to include codegt ungroupcode at the end of the codedplyrcode command chain.p

In the above code, I add the change event listener on all codeltinput typefilegtcode elements to detect if the user is uploading a file. p  pHowever, many websites use an indirect way for users to upload files. Specifically, they dont use codeltinput typefilegtcode element for users to select files for upload, but provide a small iconimage. And when clicked, the iconimage will trigger a popup window where the user can select a local file for upload. In this case, the above code does not work because the source code of the web page doesnt contain codeltinput typefilegtcode elements but the user does upload a file in the indirect way. p  pTake the current webpage for example.

Negative 69721 pIm running a series of 22 tests in rspec from bamboo and the tests are being ran on saucelabs.com.  Bamboo requires the output to be in the JUnit XML format which Ive got figured out  The problem comes when I run the tests in saucelabs, they are ran in parallel.  I have rspec generating the output using the .rspec file with these optionsp  precoderequire spechelper format RspecJunitFormatter out rspecformatter.xml codepre  pSo if you can imagine, I have 22 separate processes all competing to write their results to this rspecformatter.xml file.  Most of the time, the last process to finish wins and puts its data in the file last overwriting the other previously ran data elements and so bamboo simply reports the status of the last item to run.  Thats if Im lucky  If Im unlucky, things are being written so fast that sometimes the data from a previous process isnt cleared out and bamboo is unable to parse a bad JUNit request.p  pI need some way to have all of these separate parallel processes either combine their output to this single file and not overwrite the previous data but append it, or have each process write its own output file and then I can write a regular expression to parse through all of the files.p  pAny suggestions on how to thisp

Negative 69721 pMy problem is that I have an application that gives a user the ability to define a workflow states, transitions, events, etc. and have my application know how it reacts transitions based on the users workflow.p  pI have looked at several state machine gems, such as a hrefhttpsgithub.comaasmaasm relnofollowAASMa, and I see how I could use the gem to predefine the state machine strongbutstrong if the state machine needed to change, it looks like I would have to modify the code and redeploy. I have been arguing with my coworker about how we could  could not utilize a state machine gem to do what we want but, to me, they all seem to define a static state machine and changes to that state machine require code changes. p  pHis suggestion is dynamically modifying the Ruby class to match the users workflow changes. My thought is that the states, transitions, events, guards, etc. are persistable objects that the user modifies through the our API. Neither of our current lines of thought seem to work with the a hrefhttpswww.rubytoolbox.comcategoriesstatemachines relnofollowcurrent Ruby state machinesa without some major modification on top of those gems.p  pThe place I keep looking at as an example solution is JIRA and how you can define states, transitions, and other workflow attributes for a project dynamically.p

Negative 69721 pI am fairly new to JavaScript and I am working in node which requires a good understanding of async programming and callback design.   I have found that using embedded functions is very easy to do even when your callbacks are multiple levels deep.  Your embedded callbacks just end up being closures.p  pHowever, when you have several layers of callbacks where many of the callbacks are similar across execute routes, you end up rewriting a lot of callback code over and over in separate callback chains.  For example, if mycb1 and mycb2 definitions below are moved outside of A, they no longer have implicit access to As variables and thus, no longer function as closures. p  pExample with embedded definitions where they function as closures.p  precodemod.Afunction   var mycb1functionerr     if err       var mycb2functionerr         cberr              mod.foo2args,mycb2          elsecberr      mod.foo1args,mycb1   mod.foo1  functionargs,cb   do some work   cberr   mod.foo2  functionargs,cb   do some work   cberr   execute mod.A codepre  pI want to do the following but be able to change the variable scope for mycb1 and mycb2 functions so they can be used as closures from where ever they are called. For examplep  precodevar mycb2functionerr   ...   cberr   var mycb1functionerr   if err             mod.foo2args,mycb2  but have it act like a closure to mycb1      elsecberr   mod.Afunction   ...   mod.foo1args,mycb1  but have it act like a closure to A    mod.foo1  functionargs,cb   do some work   cberr   mod.foo2  functionargs,cb   do some work   cberr  codepre  pI know that I can implement a design that either sets variable at the mod level so they are accessible to mod level functions.  However, this seems to somewhat pollute the mod scope with variable that may only be used by a few of its methods.  I also know that I could pass in variables to make them accessible to the callbacks when they are executed.  However, if I understand how JS and callbacks work, I would have to pass those to fooX and then have foo pass them to the callbacks.  That doesnt seem like a good plan either. Can the variable scope of a function be changed so it acts like a closure from its point of execution rather than its point of definition  If not, what is the best way to modularize your callback code so it can be reusedp

Negative 69721 pI have a form in an MDI and I can have multiple instances of that form open. Upon instantiation of the form, I get a reference to another object, call it objb for purposes of this post. If objb was already instantiated, I just pass a reference of it to the form, otherwise it will get instantiated and then I pass it to the form. Its basically a singleton. There is only one instance of objb with multiple forms consuming it. On the form side, once I have a reference to objb, I subscribe to an event defined in objbs class. What Im trying to achieve is to have multiple forms subscribe to the raising of an event of a single objb instance. The problem Im running into is that only the first form is receiving the events. All other instances are not. Basically it would look like this if I diagram it outp  precode                     obja                                            f1   f2 codepre  pOnly f1 is receiving the event. f2 is not.

Negative 69721 pIm looping over a list of files, while for each file im scanning for specific things to grep out.p  precode     create .fus file     grep DIF file  awk              if  7  13                      print 4, t, 5, t, 20, t, 10, t, 11, t, 22, t, Null      gt filename.fus       create .invfus file     grep DIF file  awk              if  7  13                      print 4, t, 5, t, 20, t, 10, t, 11, t, 22, t, Null      gt filename.invfus       create .del file     echo e 1t1t1t1 gt filename.del     echo e 1t1t1t3 gtgt filename.del     grep DEL file  awk print 4, t, 5, t, 12, t, 2 gtgt filename.del codepre  pThe first awk checks if the values of column 7 and 13 are different, if they are, write to file. The second awk checks if hte values are the same, if they are, write to file. The third creates a file with 2 lines always the same, and the rest filled in by lines containing DEL.p  pThe output files I use to generate a plot, but this fails because some fields are empty. How can I change my code I guess the awk statement  so that it checks for empty fields for columns 4, 5, 20, 10, 11 and 22 and replace empty columns with dots . p

Negative 69721 pI think I know what is happening here, but would appreciate a confirmation andor reading material that can turn that think into just know, actual questions at the end of post in Tl,DR sectionp  pScenariop  pI am in the middle of testing my MVC application for a case where one of the internal components is stalling timeouts on connections to our database. p  pOn one of my web pages there is a Jquery datatable which queries for an update via ajax every half a second  my current task is to display correct error if that data requests times out. So to test, I made a stored procedure that asks DB server to wait 3 seconds before responding, which is longer than the configured timeout settings  so this guarantees a time out exception for me to trap.p  pI am testing in Chrome browser, one client. Application is being debugged in VS2013 IIS Express p  pProblem Did not expect the following symptoms to show up when my purposeful slow down is activatedp  p1 After launching the page with the rigged datatable, application slowed down in handling of all requests from the client browser  there are 3 other components that send ajax update requests parallel to the one I purposefully broke, and this same slow down also applied to any actions I made in the web application that would generate a request like navigating to other pages. The browsers debugger showed the requests were being sent on time, but the corresponding break points on the server side were getting hit much later delays of over 10 seconds to even a several minutesp  p2 My server kept processing requests even after I close the tab with the application. I closed the browser, I made sure that the chrome.exe process is terminated, but breakpoints on various Controller actions were still getting hit for 20 minutes afterward  mostly on the actions that were triggered by automatically looping ajax requests from several pages I was trying to visit during my tests. Also breakpoints were hit on main pages I was trying to navigate to. On second test I used RawCap monitor the loopback interface to make sure that there was nothing actually making requests still running in the background.p  pTheory I would like confirmed or denied with an alternate explanationp  pSo the above scenario was making looped requests at a frequency that the server couldnt handle  the client datatable loop was sending them every .5 seconds, and each one would take at least 3 seconds to generate the timeout. And obviously somewhere in IIS express there has to be a limit of how many concurrent requests it is able to handle...p  pWhat was a surprise for me was that I sort of assumed that if that limit which I also assumed to exist was reached, then requests would be denied  instead it appears they were queued for an absolutely useless amount of time to be processed later  I mean, under what scenario would it be useful to process a queued web request half an hour laterp  pSo my questions so far are thesep  pTl,DR questionsp  pDoes IIS Express that comes with Visual Studio 2013 have a concurrent connection limitp  pIf yes    Is this limit configurable somewhere, and if yes, wherep  pHow does IIS express handle situations where that limit is reached  is that handling also configurable somewhere  i mean like queueing vs. immediate error like server is busy p  pIf no    How does the server handle scenarios when requests are coming faster than they can be processed and can that handling be configured anywhere p  pHere  a hrefhttpwww.iis.netlearninstallinstallingiis7iisfeaturesandvistaeditions relnofollowhttpwww.iis.netlearninstallinstallingiis7iisfeaturesandvistaeditionsap  pI found that IIS7 at least allowed unlimited number of silmulatneous connections, but how does that actually work if the server is just not fast enough to process all requests Can a limit be configured anywhere, as well as handling of that limit being reachedp  pWould appreciate any links to online reading material on the above.p
Negative 69721 pI was creating a set up project for a COM class. So users can install the dll and get additional features as an option. However i labelled the COM Class so i renamed the dll. However when i changed the dll from class.dll to comclass.dll, and ran regAsm again, when i added the comclass.dll to the project the .tlb was class.tlb listed in the codeDetected Dependenciescode folder, keeping the old name.p  pSo i decided to create a new project with new GUIDs to just fix it and named it comclass.dll. Everything tested and compiled but once i got to the set up portion of and added the comclass.dll, nothing was showing up in codedetected dependenciescode only .net framework. Before the old .dll use to get the .tlb to show up. Now i cant get the .tlb to show up. p  pIf i add the .tlb directly to the project it gives an error at set up time regarding the setup not being able to register the .tlb file.p

Negative 69721 pThe purpose of the interface codeIDisposablecode is to release unmanaged resources in an orderly fashion. It goes hand in hand with the codeusingcode keyword that defines a scope after the end of which the resource in question is disposed of.p  pBecause this meachnism is so neat, Ive been repeatedly tempted to have classes implement codeIDisposablecode to be able to abuse this mechanism in ways its not intended for. For example, one could implement classes to handle nested contexts  like thisp  precodeclass Context  IDisposable       Put a new context onto the stack     public static void PushContext  ...        Remove the topmost context from the stack     private static void PopContext  ...        Retrieve the topmost context     public static Context CurrentContext  get  ...         Disposing of a context pops it from the stack     public void Dispose              PopContext       codepre  pUsage in calling code might look like thisp  precodeusing Context.PushContext     DoContextualStuffContext.CurrentContext   lt the context is popped upon leaving the block codepre  pPlease note that this is just an example and not to the topic of this question.p  pThe fact that codeDisposecode is called upon leaving the scope of the codeusingcode statement can also be exploited to implement all sorts of things that depend on scope, e.g. timers. This could also be handled by using a codetry ... finallycode construct, but in that case the programmer would have to manually call some method e.g. codeContext.Popcode, which the codeusingcode construct could do for thon.p  pThis usage of codeIDisposablecode does not coincide with its intended purpose a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudiosystem.idisposable28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowas stated in the documentationa, yet the temptation persists. p  pAre there concrete reasons to illustrate that this is a bad idea and dispell my fantasies forever, for example complications with garbage collection, exception handling, etc. Or should I go ahead and indulge myself by abusing this language concept in this wayp

Negative 69721 pIm totally stumped. Hope you can help. I just spent a month redeveloping our website in Concrete5 version 7.3.1, latest version, and Im ready to launch. Its a multilingual site and our SEO guy recommended not to include the language in the URL for the default language English as it would change our homepage from domain.com to domain.comen, and our old site default language was in the base directory.p  pConcrete5 doesnt support this so basically Im hoping to accomplish this with some .htaccess trickery, but am getting no where. p  pConcrete5 urls are domain.comindex.phpenpathtopage, so all pages are fed off index.php. There is a rewrite rule as follows to hide the index.php from the user and make the urls pretty.p  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAMEindex.html f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAMEindex.php f RewriteRule . index.php  codepre  pI want to further add a way to add the en for the server side from a url which doesnt include it. i.e.p  precodeRewriteRule index.php. index.phpen1 [L] codepre  pSo I can then strip the en from the urls and the system will still work. p  pIve tried putting this before concretes rewrite without index.php, after, and multiple different combinations, but keep getting a 401 error and its hard to diagnose the problem as its not so easy to see the generated url. p  pAny help would be much appreciated as Ive got to figure this out before launch. p
Negative 69721 pI am trying to draw polygons on a map, using OSM data downloaded. I have written a query that returns a list of polygons from the codeplanetosmpolygoncode table. It resturns the list as JSON objects. I am using codegl.drawArraysgl.LINESTRIP, 0, jsondatalengthcode to draw the polygons. I have done the same for points I have a list of points returned and I have been able to plot them using gl.POINTS. p  pThe problem is, I want each of the polygons to be drawn separately, but I guess using LINESTRIP is connecting one ending point of one polygon to the starting point of another polygon. p  pFor example, I want civic center plaza and buchanan street in SFO to be separate polygons. But the polygons, after being drawn, are still connected to each other through one point. I want these two to be drawn as separate polygons. How do I do itp  pI do not want to use any libraries. Just basic WebGL.

Negative 69721 pI have looked through a several forums and cannot find an answer to my specific question so dont hurt me if I have asked something that has been answered before. I have a SSRS report project that was created in Visual Studio 2005 then upgraded to 2008 before my time at my company and i need to upgrade it to 2013 Visual studio. I know normally you just open the file and use the migration wizard, however i get an error because my Visual Studio 2013 does not recognize the .rptproj file and thus does not fully migrate the solution. I have a copy of VS Shell 2010 that was able to upgrade it to 2010 but this did not help me to migrate it to 2013. Is there a way i can migrate this over without having to buy more copies of VS to do a stair step migrationp

Negative 69721 pIm a little stuck on the following, may I ask you for some direction pleasep  pI have created 2 temp tables compare1 and compare2 and Id like to list words that are common between the tables.p  pHowever, in each of the temp tables I have a numeric field, chunkIdx, that represents the position of the word.

Negative 69721 pI would like to create an object that can take one of a fixed set of input strings as an argument in the constructor.  In order to constrain the possible strings, I would like to use an enumerationtype construction.  p  pWhat I have so far is a solution that relies on two separate functions one uses the Revealing Module pattern I think to expose the fixed set of strings, like thisp  precodevar MyEnum  function      var stringA  string A     var stringB  string B     var stringC  string C      return          stringA stringA,         stringB stringB,         stringC stringC       codepre  pThe second function takes as input one of the string values along with other values as arguments for construction.  For instance, given a function called MyObject, this is how I call itp  precodevar myInstance  new MyObjectMyEnum.stringB, 42, blue codepre  pWhat I want to know is this  Is there an alternate architecture that combines MyEnum and MyObject into a single entity  MyEnum is not used by anything else, but it was the only way I could find to have the instances of the strings available to the MyObject constructor.p  pI tried somehow making the enumeration values available through a prototype method on MyObject, but the problem is that the method doesnt exist until the object is instantiated.  p  pFor background, Im coming from the land of C, so I know my thinking is biased in that direction, and maybe the solution is more psychological than technical.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong Its been pointed out the revealing module pattern is unnecessary here, which I understand and agree with.  That was a vestigial structure from an earlier attempt to solve this problem.  At this point, I dont know if its preferable to edit the RM pattern out since its irrelevant to the question or if this edit is sufficient.  Id prefer to hide my shame, but I can also own a mistake...p

Negative 69721 pI am learning about Java IO.

Negative 69721 pI am working on existing rails project and just finished writing some basic codeRSpeccode tests for that. In our codedatabase.ymlcode file we have connection to 34 different databases and all are either pointing to either codeproductioncode database or codestagingcode database. For testing environment I created a different codeymlcode file called codedatabase.test.ymlcode and then symlinked it to codedatabase.ymlcode file, so that the correct testing databases connections are created.p  pMy codedatabase.test.ymlcode looks something like thisp  precodeabc   adapter mysql2   host localhost   reconnect true   username monty   password python   database abc  pqr   adapter mysql2   host localhost   reconnect true   username monty   password python   database pqr  test   adapter mysql2   host localhost   reconnect true   username monty   password python   pool 50   database testing codepre  pMy problem now is that how can I enforce that other developerstesters use this codedatabase.test.ymlcode and not accidentally run the main codedatabase.ymlcode file which contains connections to codestagingcode and codeproductioncode databases.p  pEDITp  pTo further clarify my question, I have codeestablishconnectioncode in various models that connect to different databases. So I am not sure the earlier suggestions will solve my problem.p  pExamplep  precodeclass Abc lt ActiveRecordBase   establishconnection abc end codepre  pOne way I can think of for solving my problem is doing something like thisp  precodeclass Abc lt ActiveRecordBase   establishconnection abcRails.env end codepre  pand in the codedatabase.ymlcodep  precodedefaults ampdefaults   adapter mysql2   encoding utf8   username root   password secret  abcproduction   database abc   ltlt defaults  abcdevelopment   database abcdevlopment   ltlt defaults  abctest   database abctest   ltlt defaults codepre  pBut I am not sure if this the best practice and I really dont feel to change the application code to setup test environment is good practice. This idea is based on a hrefhttpblog.nistu.de20120325multidatabasesetupwithrailsandrspec relnofollowhttpblog.nistu.de20120325multidatabasesetupwithrailsandrspecap  pAny nudge or pointers towards the correction direction will be greatly helpful.p

Negative 69721 pIm having trouble getting LDAP Authentication working with SpringWS using LDAP user authentication.

Negative 69721 pI have a website which has many pages that are not exactly the same, but one thing they have in common is that on each page there are some tabs, and if you click TAB A, certain information shows up, then if you click TAB B, other information, etc.p  pI know that it is very easy to use Angular to do this, and I wish to use it, however I do not wish to convert the entire site to a full Angular application. I simply want to include the Angular javascript file on every page of the site, and only use the nghide and ngshow functionality for these tab items.p  pSo my question is Will it affect a users experience much if every page he goes to on my site has to launch Angular again I am not worried much about the network times of downloading Angular.js because I am sure I can configure caching so that the actual script doesnt have to reload, but what I am considering is the CPUmemory aspect and whether it will result in an extra period of time for every page to load  this is already an issue on this site, so adding an extra 0.5 seconds lets say would be undesirable.p

Negative 69721 pI call into a COM component from a C project, via an interop assembly that I generate from the COM DLL.

Negative 69721 pI am very new to Javascript, and having some trouble understanding the prototype chain. My understanding is that if you create an object cat, and set that objects prototype to another object animal, you will inherit its attributes and methods.p  pHowever in my sandbox program, I dont see that happening. I think I must have something wrong with my understanding of prototypical inheritance.p  precodefunction       window.onload  function          document.getElementByIdmain.innerHTML  getMessage           function animal         this.speak  function             return I am a   this.species  , hear me   this.sound                    function getMessage         var cat           cat.prototype  new animal         cat.species  cat         cat.sound  meow         return cat.speak    Causing error cat.speak not defined        codepre  pI thought that if you set an objects prototype and attempt to access a method or attribute that doesnt exist, JS will automatically go up the prototype chain looking for that method. But I dont see that happening here and I dont understand why. p  pI have noticed that it does work fine when I do this p  precodevar cat  Objectnew animal codepre  pAnd Im happy to do that, but I would like to understand why the first method doesnt work. p  pThank you very much for your time.p
