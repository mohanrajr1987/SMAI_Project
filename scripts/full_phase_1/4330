Positive 4330 pIm trying to make an application that copies volume to a selected location in the computer. The volume is an external hard disk that includes a copy of my previous computer C volume.p  pFirst of all, when I tried to copy the directories and the files I made an recursive function that gets the directories and the files and copy them to the new location, the recursive function gets the directories with Directory.GetDirectories function, after I get the sub directories I make the same function to get the sub directories of the sub directories and keeps doing that untill there are no directories to get, all works fine but when I tried to use the application on my volume I got an infiniate loop with Application Data folder, that means that the GetDirectories function found Application Data folder in the previous Application Data again and again. In order to fix that I checked if the path does not include Application DataApplication Data and just the I used the GetDirectories function. Maybe that solution caused the problem Im going to ask about.p  pThe problem is that when I use the function GetDirectories I get an exception Could not find a part of the path but my code looks like thisp  precodeifDirectory.Existpath      string[] subdirs  Directory.GetDirectoriespath  codepre  pSo how is that possible that the Exist function finds the folder but the GetDirectories function does not find it By the way, the application works properly on directories that are not part of windows system. So what is the problem And how can I solve it or how can I make copy application that will copy C volume Thanks a lotp

There are also various ideas how to solve this, but I tried many of them as use the method clone, or arraycopy etc.  and none of them works for my problem or I was just stupid. As I have read, the problem is probably the this statement. I would be really really grateful if anyone could come up with a bit of code, which can copy my object without changing the original onep  pThanks alotp
Positive 4330 pConsider there are 3 csv files , csv1, csv2 and csv3. I have to combine these files to a new xls file csvtotal . The way it has to be copied is. First i have to open csv1 and copy all its contents and paste it to the first sheet of xls csvtotal and rename the first sheet ascsv1. simillarly i have to copy csv2 to the 2nd sheet of csvtotal and the sheet has to be renamed to csv2. This process has to be repeated for as many csv files i have. p  pIs there a way to automate this process . KuTools is an option i found but it accepts only xls files as inputs not csv files. p  pKindly provide me suggestions.p
Positive 4330 pIm kinda new to manipulating excel files. Heres my problem. I have column x on sheet Z which is populated with data and has a formula Sum. I need to copy that formula on the next column x1, same sheet, after which I need to populate it with data from a result set and I dont really know how to do it Copying the formula on the next column, that is. I only found how to manipulate cells or rows, but this is about a pretty large amount of data. Anyone have been through this so far p
Positive 4330 pI have a REXX program, running in Windows 10, that makes thousands of copies of the same file, all on C, for a total of tens of gigabytes. The strange thing is that the time per copy varies unpredictably, by as much as a factor of 10, over the course of the process. Monitoring the process I can see that initially it runs very quickly until the cache is full, and then it slows down dramatically, which I guess I can understand. But even after that it can slow even more and then speed up again.p  pI dont start any other processes while this one is running. Anything automatic, such as an online check for updates to some app, would only run for a few seconds, but the slow periods can last 2030 minutes. I never see any competing processes in Task Manager.p  pCan anyone explain this or suggest a way to improve the performance Thanks.p

Positive 4330 pI made an application that copy directory from one location to another, the application and the copy process works fine when I try to copy from an external hard disk to the computer, from the computer to an external hard disk, from an external hard disc to another one and from the computer to the computer. Today I ran some tests on my application and weird thing happened. I have an external hard disc that includes the C volume from my previous computer, when I tried to copy it to another computer the application copied directories and files from the destination computer. For example, when the application try to copy the users folder it gets and copy the users from the destination computer and not from the volume on the external hard disk. My application uses a recursive function that gets all the sub folders and the sub files from the selected path but somehow when it try to get  and copy the users folder from the external hard disk volume it copy the users folder from the destination computer C volume. I checked the paths and everything is fine. What is the problem and why the application could not regonizecopy from the external hard disk volumep
Negative 4330 pIs there any easygeneral way to clean an XML based data source prior to using it in an XmlReader so that I can gracefully consume XML data that is nonconformant to the hexadecimal character restrictions placed on XMLp  pNote p  ul liThe solution needs to handle XML data sources that use character encodings other than UTF8, e.g. by specifying the character encoding at the XML document declaration. Not mangling the character encoding of the source while stripping invalid hexadecimal characters has been a major sticking point.li liThe removal of invalid hexadecimal characters should only remove hexadecimal encoded values, as you can often find href values in data that happens to contains a string that would be a string match for a hexadecimal character.li ul  pemBackgroundemp  pI need to consume an XMLbased data source that conforms to a specific format think Atom or RSS feeds, but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the XML specification.p  pIn .NET if you have a Stream that represents the XML data source, and then attempt to parse it using an XmlReader andor XPathDocument, an exception is raised due to the inclusion of invalid hexadecimal characters in the XML data. My current attempt to resolve this issue is to parse the Stream as a string and use a regular expression to remove andor replace the invalid hexadecimal characters, but I am looking for a more performant solution.p
Negative 4330 pI have wondered about the appropriateness of reflection in C code. For example I have written a function which iterates through the properties of a given source object and creates a new instance of a specified type, then copies the values of properties with the same name from one to the other. I created this to copy data from one autogenerated LINQ object to another in order to get around the lack of inheritance from multiple tables in LINQ.p  pHowever, I cant help but think code like this is really cheating, i.e. rather than using using the provided language constructs to achieve a given end it allows you to circumvent them.p  pTo what degree is this sort of code acceptable What are the risks What are legitimate uses of this approachp

Negative 4330 pWe have a web application that manages inventory for our computer support group.  One of the things that we will be using this for is to drive a Computers Currently In Use map for our larger computer labs so that users can find an open computer more easily the lab in our Main library has around 150 computers.  The image used for the background of the display of this page is managed through the administrative part of the application as are the relationships between what stations are located in the lab and where they are located.p  pWed like to make it so that admins can turn off the display of the map page for each location when the map is being updated in the administrative interface.  My idea is to extend the table that holds the location data to indicate whether the location is available for map display, and check this when the map is updated.  If the check indicates that the map should not be displayed, the page would draw a suitable message instead of displaying the map image and in use overlay data.p  pIn the hopes that someone else may have done this, or something like it, before, Id like to hear your suggestions on alternatives.p  pThe map page will be refreshed periodically one every 2 minutes via AJAX by passing down the image url to use and the overlay data positions of table and number of computers available at each.  Im thinking that when the page detects a transition from dont display to display it would refresh the page via HTTP GET.p

Negative 4330 pWere having a very frustrating problem in our production environment.p  pWe have a report that will sometimes return very quickly, and other times not return at all.  When the problem is happening, the report will process for 15 minutes or so then the browser will display a Cannot display webpage error.  This problem is sporadic usually lasting for a few days, then we get a few days of very fast processing, then back to slow.  When the report is running fine we can return over 14k records in about 10 seconds.p  pIm told by our data team that nothing has occurred on the SQL Servers at the time we see the switch from slow to fast.  No index rebuilds, statistics recalcs, etc.p  pThe underlying report query stored procedure always runs fast.  Even when we are experiencing the problem, I can connect to the production database, with the same user as the report uses, and run the stored procedure with the same parameters and it always returns quickly.  We have checked for blocking, and none is happening.p  pThe report does have quite a few parameters.  Ive seen posts regarding parameter sniffing so I created a parameter free version of the report and I still get the same results.p  pThere is nothing complicated about this report.  Its a table.  No grouping or filtering is done at the report level.  There are no subreports.  The report does use interactive sorting.p  pThe report can return upwards of 14k records.  The total amount of data for this is around 2MB.  But like I said earlier, some days the report runs fine and will return even the max amount of records in just a seconds.p  pThe report uses a shared data source that is also used by many other reports that do not experience this issue.p  pIn the report database, were seeing records being added to the RunningJobs table for these report requests, but we dont see any processing occur after that.  Its like the report server is forgetting about them. p  pOur current line or thought is that the Report Server is not operating properly since these entries in RunningJobs just sit there and are not processed.p  pDoes anyone know why a job might sit in the RunningJobs table  We should be seeing something in the Report Server log files if these jobs are being run, correct  Is there anything else we should be testingp  pOur Report Server is at version 9.00.3050.00.  We are accessing through the Report Viewer web control.p
Negative 4330 pI am wondering how you would approach this problemp  pI have two Taxrates that can apply to my products. I specifically want to avoid persisting the Taxrates into the database while still being able to change them in a central place like Taxrate from 20 to 19 etc.p  pso I decided it would be great to have them just compiled into my application Its internal. The problem is that I want to not only to know the Rate but also the Name of the Taxrate.p  pI could go with an Enum that maps to the value. But then Id have to create some method that retrieves the German Name of that Taxrate for the English enumvalue I write my code in english, the App is in german.p  pI thought about just using hardcoded objects to reflect this,p  precodepublic interface Taxrate      string Name  get      decimal Rate  get    public class NormalTaxRate  Taxrate      public string Name      get  return Regelsteuersatz        public decimal Rate      get  return 20m    codepre  pBut then Id have to create some sort of list that holds two instances of those two objects. Doing it static may work, but still Id have to keep some sort of list.  Also Id have to find a way to map my POCO Domain Object to this, because I doubt NHibernate can instantiate the right Object depending on a value in a field.p  pIt doesnt really feel right, and I think Im missing something here. Hope somebody has a better solution, I cant think of one.p  pgreetings, Danielp  pemPs  also please retag this question if you find something fitting, I cant think of more meaningful tags right now.emp

Ive read that data readers are the way to go but I cant use a datareader directly from the SQL table due to needing to use the data access layer. p  pI also dont have the option of partially filling the datatable as I need to apply a lot of sorting methods to the data to display what I need.p  pAny suggestions of ways to speed up data tables or perhaps use something else thats more efficientp

Negative 4330 pWhile using a MemoryStream, I find myself often copying hence duplicating data to a temporary array of bytes.p  pI think its a little bit of a waste of ressource, because MemoryStream dosent let you directly access the underlying byte array.p  pIn this situation, whats the real advantage of a MemoryStream I have read somewhere that it acts like a memorymapped file. Data is brought from disk only on access, consuming less memory.p  pIs that true I dont think so. Maybe its the case for a FileStreamp  pThank you for your clarification.p
Negative 4330 pLets say I have a large database that consists of products in groups. Lets say that there are 5 groups, each of them has 100,000 products. the product ids are random integers so are the group idsp  pI need to find a product in a specific group. My question is which primary key is more efficientp  ol licodesid, pidcodeli licodepid, sidcodeli ol  psid, pid is intuitive, but when searching in this order, MySQL will have to isolate 100,000 out of the 500,000 rows and then find a single number in 100,000. On the  other hand, codepid, sidcode sounds more optimal to me since it will force mysql not to create the large 100,000 group in the first stage, but to go directly to the right item or up to 5 items if there are similar pids in different cids.p  pIs 2 indeed faster p  pUPDATE OK. I copied a real table to two copies. table0 has primary key sid,pid. table1 has pid,sid.p  presult of queryp  pexplain select  from items0 where sid  22746 and pid  2109418034 1, SIMPLE, items0, ref, PRIMARY, PRIMARY, 8, const,const, 14, p  pexplain select  from items1 where sid  22746 and pid  2109418034p  p1, SIMPLE, items1, ref, PRIMARY, PRIMARY, 8, const,const, 11, p  pYet another update I also added the two keys to the same table and run explain. got this Primary starts with sidpid1, Index2  starts with pid1,sidp  p1, SIMPLE, items, ref, PRIMARY,index2, index2, 8, const,const, 13, p  pIm not sure, what conclusions can I draw from this testp

However, Im not having any luck making that work.  GoDaddy wont help, and wont comment on how to accomplish this, or even if its possible.  Ive never worked with connecting directly to MDF files either, which complicates things for me.p  pDoes anyone have any experience accomplishing this with GoDaddy, or if not, then with another similar hosting environment  Id appreciate any insight you could provide  specifically, what the connection string should look like, and any basic security Id need to apply to my database prior to detaching it from my local server.p  pIf I cant make this happen, then my only reasonable option left that I can think of is...gasp...Microsoft Access.p  pThanks very much for the help.p

Negative 4330 pI need to produce an embedded ARM design that has requirements to do many things that embedded Linux would do. However the design is cost sensitive and does not need huge amounts of horse power. Mostly will be talking to serial interfaces. Ideally I would like to use one of the low end ARMs. What is the lowest configuration of an ARM that you have successfully used embedded Linux on. p  pEditp  pThe application needs a file system on some kind of flash device and the ability to run applications for processing the data. Some of the applications might be written by others than myself. I also need to ability to load new applications or update old apps using the serial ports to accept the apps. p  pWhen I have looked at other embedded OSes they seem to be more of a real time threading solution than having the ability to run applications. I am open to what ever will get the job done.p

Negative 4330 pOK, this is going to be my beating a dying horse for the 3rd time.p  pHowever, this question is different from my earlier two about closuresdelegates, which asks about plans for delegates and what are the projected specs and implementation for closures.p  pThis question is about  why is the Java community struggling to define 3 different types of closures when we could simply steal the whole concept of delegates lock, stock and barrel from our beloved and friendly neighbour  Microsoft.p  pThere are two nontechnical conclusions I would be very tempted to jump into  p  ol liThe Java community should hold up its pride, at the cost of needing to go thro convoluted efforts, by not succumbing to borrowing any Microsoft concepts or otherwise vindicate Microsofts brilliance.  li liDelegates is a Microsoft patented technology.li ol  pAlright, besides the above two possibilities,p  pQ1. Is there any weakness or inadequacy in .NETstyle delegates that the three or more forms of closures would be addressingp  pQ2. I am asking this while shifting between Java and C and it intrigues me that C delegates does exactly what I needed. Are there features that would be implemented in closures that are not currently available in C delegates If so what are they because I cannot see what I need more than what C delegates has adequately provided mep  pQ3. I know that one of the concerns about implementing closuresdelegates in java is the reduction of orthogonality of the language, where more than one way is exposed to perform a particular task. Is it worth the level convolution and time spent to avoid delegates just to ensure java retains its level of orthogonality In relational design, we know that it is advisable to break orthogonality by frequently adequately satisfying only the 2nd normal form. Why cant java be subjected to reduction of orthogonality and OOness for the sake of simplicityp  pQ4. The architecture of JVM is technically constrained from implementing .NETstyled delegates. If this reason WERE subjunctive to emphasize unlikelihood true, then why cant the three closures proposals be hidden behind a simple delegate keyword or annotation if we dont like to use delegate, we could use method. I cannot see how delegate statement format is more complex than the three closure proposals.p

Negative 4330 pI have a c .net app. So I created a notifyIcon that sits in the tray. What I want to do is when the user hits the x button on the form, I want it to close to the tray.

Negative 4330 pIm in the process of moving a JSF heavy web application to a REST and mainly JS module application . p  pIve watched scalable javascript application architecture by Nicholas Zakas on YUI theater excellent video and I implemented much of the talk with good success, but I have some questions p  ol lipI found the lecture a little confusing in regards to the relationship between modules and sandboxes, on one hand, to my understanding, modules should not be affected by something happening outside of their sandbox and this is why they publish events via the sandbox and not via the core, since the core is for hiding the base libary but each module in the application gets a new sandbox Shouldnt the sandbox limit events to the modoules using it or should events be published cross page e.g.  if I have two editable tables but I want to contain each one in a different sandbox and its events affect only the modules inside that sandbox, something like message box per table which is a different modulewidget, how can I do that with sandbox per module, of course I can prefix the events with the moduleid but that creates coupling that I want to avoid ... and I dont want to package modules together as one module per combination as I already have 67 modules.pli lipWhile I can hide the base library for small things like id selector etc.. I would still like to use the base library for module dependencies and resource loading and use something like YUI loader or dojo.require so in fact Im hiding the base library but the modules themselves are defined and loaded by the base library ... seems a little strange to me. pli liplibraries dont return simple js objects but usually wrap them e.g.  You can do something like .classname.each.. which cleans the code a lot , it makes no sense to wrap the base and then in the module create a dependency for the base library by executing .each but not using those features makes a lot of code written which can be left out ... and implementing that functionality is very bug prone. pli lipDoes anyone have any experience with building a front side stack of this order How easy is it to change a base library andor have modules from different libraries , using yui datatable but doing form validation with dojo ... pli lipSomewhat of a combination of 24 if you choose to do something like I said and load dojo form validation widgets for inputs via YUI loader would that mean dojocore is a module and the form module is dependent on it pli ol  pThanks. p

If a messages spans multiple packets you can buffer them together to make the message.p  pThe question is if I am using c TcpSocket or TcpListener to send message over TCP is it still necessary to include a vli or does the c socket libraries take care of it and ensure that one message is send per event and a message is not broken down into multiple packets.p

Negative 4330 pIm attempting to build a web app and Ive run into a bit of a wall. Im not asking for anyone to hold my hand through making this, just some advice and a push in the right direction.p  pSo, Im trying to build an app that uses the Google Maps API to display a map of local parks near you and allow people to post pickup games informal sporting events for a specific time at a specific park. Simple enough rightp  pSo far Ive created a database with a table of local parks columns name, longitude, latitude and a php script that takes that table and turns it into an XML file that the map uses to plot the points of the parks. Ive also created a form that uses php to insert new data into the table and thus create a new park marker on the map.p  pThis has all gone well so far but Im just not sure how to proceed. I think I want to create a table games columns sport, time, park but Im not sure if that will work. Will I be able to setup a relationship between the parks and games table so that many games belong to a park If so, how would I map those games Does my thinking make sensep

Negative 4330 pIve been testing typing inside textInput components with the Windows Japanese IME turned on. All works well out of the box, which is awesome. One fairly specific question I have, though, is about typing numbers. It seems from my limited experience that numbers typed in default to Zenkaku 2 bytes which dont seem to be accepted by the textinput as committed values. One can switch to Hankaku 1 Byte notation by pressing F10 and the commit works. My question is about whats acceptable to a user. From my uninformed standpoint it seems like having to press F10 would be super annoying for a user and thus either the textInput should accept Zenkaku values or it should default to typing Hankaku both of which I assume may be possible with a little bit of code on focusIn or ValueCommitted. But then again, it could very well be that this is in fact the standard behavior for most web apps in Japanese and thus not annoying at all. In fact, there may be a great reason for why Zenkaku happens by default.p  pWould love to hear any thoughts from anyone who has dealt with localizing to Japanese, or any advice on web resources where an answer to such a question could be found.p  pthank youp  pfp

Negative 4330 pI have a model tube which is a database having the various data for vacuum tubes. I want to dynamically loop through all the columns and create a basic table for my new and edit pages.

How can I generate my textfield inputs dynamically based on the attributenames array  The table I am using has about 30 attributes and I think its silly to build them all by hand, especially given that if they change in the future then the code will break.

Any ideas I thought it might have something to do with the launchMode of the activity, but removed singleInstance and it didnt make a difference. p  pAs I mentioned above, I can confirm the permissions activity is started in Facebook.java. p  precode try          Log.e, Starting activity         activity.startActivityForResultintent, activityCode      catch ActivityNotFoundException e          didSucceed  false      codepre  pFor what its worth, I can confirm the code used below.p  pIve implemented the authorizeCallback method in onActivityResultp  precodeOverride public void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data      mStateHolder.getFacebook.authorizeCallbackrequestCode, resultCode, data  codepre  p.. but its never called. The authorize method Ive used is as followsp  precodefacebook.authorizethis, new String[] userbirthday , new DialogListener          public void onCompleteBundle values              Log.eTAG, onComplete              I make a request here..                   ...with the other methods as well  codepre  pOther potentially useful info liIm running a Nexus One, 2.3.4li liThe Facebook app is installedli liIt works fine if I force the Dialog method, but Im trying to get SSO working.lip  pEDIT Urgh After much searching, I found the problem. There was a rogue Intent.FLAGACTIVITYNOHISTORY flag in the intent which doesnt keep the activity in the stack. Thanks everyone for attempting to answer this.p  pEDIT2 removing launchModesingleInstance does make a difference too btw.. I started getting the error Failed to read calling packages signature.p
Negative 4330 pI have RichTextBox which I do heavy message logging from multi threads. After some time I first received the DisconnectedContext was detected message and I removed the breaking on exception from the DebugExceptions... window. But then I received ContextSwitchDeadlock was detected. I removed this too and the UI came back to life. After some time it freezed again.p  pIs there a way to prevent this Or is there a component that supports coloring, changing fonts to give a visual feedback in .NET like RichTextBox but without this errorp  blockquote   pstrongContextSwitchDeadlock was detectedstrongbr   strongMessagestrong The CLR has been unable to   transition from COM context 0x6eb0760   to COM context 0x6eb08d0 for 60   seconds. The thread that owns the   destination contextapartment is most   likely either doing a non pumping wait   or processing a very long running   operation without pumping Windows   messages. This situation generally has   a negative performance impact and may   even lead to the application becoming   non responsive or memory usage   accumulating continually over time. To   avoid this problem, all single   threaded apartment STA threads   should use pumping wait primitives   such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles and   routinely pump messages during long   running operations.p blockquote

Negative 4330 pIve been asking a series of evolving questions regarding my Android project that continually plots Bluetooth data in realtime. And I havent done a very good job of asking questions.p  pSo what I need to do is edit this question, clean it up, add important detail, and most importantly I need to add code fragments of relevant sections of code, especially sections Ive hacked on quite a bit, and provide explanation about these sections of code. That way maybe I might get an answer to my questionconcerns which are  Is my current solution an OK one Is it going to hold up as I add new featuresp  pBasically what Ive already done is create a first version of my app by cobbling together some open source code a hrefhttppymasde.esblueterm relnofollowBlueterma and a hrefhttpandroidplot.comwikiOrientationSensorExample relnofollowOrientationSensora.p  pIts been suggested that I add a thread, a handler, a Service, or use Async Task, or AIDL, etc. But I have decided I dont want to modify or replace my existing solution unless I really should. Mainly I want to know if its good enough to move forward and emextendem it to add other features.p  pBy the way what I have previously referred to as BluetoothData is just bluetooth data its 16 bit data received from a remote Bluetooth device at the rate of 2 to 10 samplessecond. My app is basically a data acquisition system that acquiresreceives bluetooth data and plots it.p  pHeres a description of the Blueterm open source code I started with see link above. Blueterm is basically a terminal emulator program that communicates over Bluetooth. It consists of several activities with Blueterm being the most important. It discovers, pairs, and connects with a remote Bluetooth device that supports SPPRfComm. When connected I can use Blueterm to configure the remote device by sending it commands to turn on sampling, change the number of channels to sample to one channel, change to format of the incoming data I like comma separated data, etcp  pHeres a description of the OrientationSensorExample open source code I started with see link above. Its basically an example application of the AnroidPlot library. The OrientationSensor activity implements SensorEventListener. This includes overriding onSenorChanged which is called whenever new orientation sensor data is taken, and it redraws the graph.p  pHaving cobbled together these two open source projects Blueterm and OrientationSensorExample into one application Blueterm heres a description of how the overall application Blueterm works. When I start Blueterm the whole screen emulates a nice blue terminal. From the Options Menu I discover, pair with, connect to, and configure a remote bluetooth device as described above. Once I have configured the remote device, I go again to the Options Menu and select Plot data which launches the Plot activity. The terminal emulator goes away, and a nice scrolling realtime plot from the Plot activity shows up. p  pHeres how I did this. In onOptionsItemSelected I added a case to launch the Plot activity as followsp  precodeOverride public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      switch item.getItemId      case R.id.connect          if getConnectionState  BluetoothSerialService.STATENONE               Launch the DeviceListActivity to see devices and do scan             Intent serverIntent  new Intentthis, DeviceListActivity.class             startActivityForResultserverIntent, REQUESTCONNECTDEVICE                  else             if getConnectionState  BluetoothSerialService.STATECONNECTED                  mSerialService.stop                 mSerialService.start                      return true     case R.id.preferences         doPreferences         return true     case R.id.menuspecialkeys         doDocumentKeys         return true     case R.id.plotdata         doPlotData         return true          return false   private void doPlotData      Intent plotdata  new Intentthis, com.vtrandal.bluesentry.Plot.class     startActivityplotdata  codepre  pThen in the bluetooth background thread I added a call to update to call plotData as followsp  precode   Look for new input from the ptty, send it to the terminal emulator.   private void update      int bytesAvailable  mByteQueue.getBytesAvailable     int bytesToRead  Math.minbytesAvailable, mReceiveBuffer.length     try          int bytesRead  mByteQueue.readmReceiveBuffer, 0, bytesToRead         appendmReceiveBuffer, 0, bytesRead          VTR use existing handler that calls update to get data into plotting activity         OrientationSensor orientationSensor  new OrientationSensor         Plot.plotDatamReceiveBuffer, 0, bytesRead       catch InterruptedException e          VTR OMG their swallowing this exception       codepre  pThen in the Plot activity I basically cleaned house, removed implements SensorEventListener and some related methods and variables, and wrote plotData to be called as shown above.

The update method essentially appends newly received bluetooth data to the screen buffer using the append method. So, the background threads update method looked like a good place to call plotPlot. So I designed plotData to plot the data being passed to append. This works as long plotData is a static method. I would appreciate an explanation as to why plotData seemingly must be static in order to work.p  pAnd again my overall questionconcerns Is my current solution an OK one Is it going to hold up as I add new featuresp

Negative 4330 pThis is actually a follow up question of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6764075lazyiostringnotgarbagecollectedthisa question. I managed to get the profiling to work and the problem really seems to be lazy evaluation. p  pThe data structure Im using is a codeMap Int Map Int Textcode, where codeTextcode is from a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagetext relnofollowData.Texta. The problem is, that the function which builds this map creates a huge thunk. Working on an input text of about 3 MB the programs needs more than 250 MB of memory.p  pNow to the real purpose of this questionp  pTo get the amount of characters in this data structure is use the following functionp  precodetype TextResource  M.Map Int M.Map Int T.Text  totalSize  TextResouce gt Int totalSize  M.fold  . M.fold . T.length 0 0 codepre  pNot beautiful, but it gets the job done. Im using this function in the main function right after the TextResource is created. The interesting thing is, that when I profile the program by using the RTS option codehrcode or codehccode the memory usage goes down to 70 or 50 MB after a while, which would be totally fine.p  pUnfortunately this only works when using the profiling options and the codetotalSizecode function  without them its back to 250 MB.p  pI uploaded the program lt 70 lines together with a test file and a cabal file, so that you can try it yourself a hrefhttpwww.fileupload.netdownload3623479leak.zip.html relnofollowLinkap  pThe test.xml is a generated XML file, which should be put into the executables directory.  To build, codecabal configure enableexecutableprofilingcode and afterwards codecabal buildcode should be enough if you have the profiling versions of the required libraries installed. p  pYou can see the change when running the program once with codeRTS hccode and once without.p  pId be really great if someone could run the program, since Im really stuck here. I already tried to put in codedeepseqcode at several places, but nothing works well, besides using the profiling options. p  pstrongEditstrongp  blockquote   pProfiling does show, however, that only 20MB of the heap is used, so as in my comment, I blame GHC for not freeing as much of the GC nursery memory as you seem to want.p blockquote  pThanks, that pointed me into the correct direction. As it turns out, you can tell GHC to perform a garbage collection a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagesarchivebaselatestdochtmlSystemMem.htmlv3aperformGC relnofollowperformGCa, which works perfectly well, after deepseqing the map.

Negative 4330 pI created an applet that requires a CSV file for information.  The way the applet works, is that there is a text field in which you type in your zip code, then you press a button. That causes the program to parse through the CSV file which contains a latitude and longitude, then display the latitude and longitude on a codeJLabelcode in the applet. p  pWhen I created it, I debugged it and tested it, so I know it works on my desktop when running in eclipse.  The problem is when I put in on the web, it displays but cant do anything, meaning it is just an applet with a text field and a button, but when you press the button, nothing happens. I know that it is not my codeActionListenercode, because it works on the desktop, but I must be doing something wrong with the HTML of it. The name of the CSV file is codezips.csvcode.  The name of the main class is codemain.classcode or codemain.javacode and the action listener is codemyActionListener.classcode or codemyActionListener.javacode.p  pHere is the HTML that I am using for it right now  p  precodeltapplet archivesitesdefaultfilesmyApplet.jar codemain.class width500 height200gt  ltappletgt codepre  blockquote   h2Revisionh2      pstrongRomething else that someone recommended to me was to create a php script that will parse the csv file, and than have that return a value to the java applet.

Negative 4330 pI am writing a simple utility to take application logs and display them to the user. It neeeds to take log entries from multiple files and merge them into a single internal storage. The merging is based on the log entry time and so it is possible for multiple entries to have the same time. Note that the size of the logs is fairly small and so the maximum size is likely to be 10 files containing 2,000 log entries each.p  pI also want to present this to the user but allow them to filter based on different logging levels debug, warning, error etc... and also filter based on the file it came from. This sounds like a very common type of problem to solve and so others must have experience about the best approach. I had thought of the following...p  p1, Use a DataSet to store the log entries and then use a DataView to apply filtering, sorting.p  p2, Use a couple of Listlt instances, a master and then a copy that is filtered to the required entries and apply a custom IComparer function to the filtered list to get the correct ordering.p  pThoughtsp
Negative 4330 pI need to create a summary table at the end of a log with some values that  are obtained inside a class. The table needs to be printed in fixedwidth  format. I have the code to do this already, but I need to limit Strings,  doubles and ints to a fixedwidth size that is hardcoded in the code.p  pSo, suppose I want to print a fixedwidth table withp  precode    int,string,double,string     int,string,double,string     int,string,double,string     int,string,double,string      and the fixed widths are 4, 5, 6, 6. codepre  pIf a value exceeds this width, the last characters need to be cut off. So  for examplep  precode    124891, difference, 22.348, montreal codepre  pthe strings that need to be printed ought to bep  precode    1248 diffe 22.348 montre codepre  pI am thinking I need to do something in the constructor that forces a  string not to exceed a certain number of characters. I will probably  cast the doubles and ints to a string, so I can enforce the maximum width  requirements.p  pI dont know which method does this or if a string can be instantiated to  behave taht way.  Using the formatter only helps with the  fixedwith formatting for printing the string, but it does not actually  chop characters that exceed the maximum length.p
Negative 4330 pI am trying to drag and drop a crosshair onto a codeMapViewcode.  I have an codeImageViewcode button on the screen.  When I touch it, the button disappears and a new codeImageViewcode appears.  The new codeImageViewcode is supposed to sit centered under my finger until I release it somewhere, but for some reason the offset is incorrect. The crosshair appears downright of where I am touching.p  pThe image does move proportionately so I believe the problem is with the codeoffsetxcode and codeoffsetycode which I define in the codeACTIONDOWNcode section.  Then, in codeACTIONUPcode I need to codecreateMarkerx,ycode on the correct coordinates under my finger, but that is offset incorrectly as well.p  pI have tried various ways to make it centered, and some are better than others.

Negative 4330 pI have an OS X app which uses the codeNSSpeechSynthesizercode class to read some text. I need to be able to set the speed of the reading, which is done using the coderatecode property of codeNSSpeechSynthesizercode. However, different voices have different baseline reading rates and different ranges as well. The problem is that I cannot find a way to get this range from the voice so that I know what values are acceptable for the voice. This is important since I want to be able to abstract from the difference in ranges and just let the user choose something like slownormalfast. But for a voice with a baseline of 180 words for a minute a value of 100 would be considered slow, which clearly is not the case for a voice with a baseline of 100 words per minute.p  pIs there a way of getting those ranges I didnt find anything useful in the class reference for codeNSSpeechSynthesizercode.p

Negative 4330 pI have a game I am attempting to program but the initial data entry for it is just huge. The thing is all this data is readonly.

I know that when data is bytecode it is generally much faster so that would work as well. Only the program needs to read it and even if a user were to change the XMLWhateverOtherConfig file, the additions would get ignored.p  pThanks for the patience. If I need to clarify anything then let me know. This is very much in the alpha stages and I havent even gotten all my thoughts out of my head yet so I am just going as I think of it for much of this.

As I understand it, this can only be done by building the whole firmware because it makes use of components hidden to the sdk.

Negative 4330 pthe question is quite simple so I hope I would be lucky to be clear enough to avoid creating code sample for it. We are using Axis2 1.5.1 to be precise which is to create Java client code and server stubs via wsdl2java, using our handcrafted WSDLXSD files. The service is generated in documentstyle mode, and strongwe use ADB beans serialization stackstrong.p  pOur new webservice has some common attributes in all methods that we are to create. Say, each of requests is to be marked with some accessToken, otherPartyID and other similar properties. p  pI was able to employ inheritance in schemas, so RequestResponse types do extend common complexType and I dont have to repeat myself while creating schemasWSDL for the webservice. But, when I try to code up the implementation, I to my utter frustration see that all codegenerated RequestResponse objects are inheriting java.lang.Object and theres no common superclass with the common properties. p  pIt would be quite nice to have such a class, so that code which treats those common properties stays generic and I dont have to use reflection and other dirty tricks to avoid monkey coding.p  pMy current suspicion is that AXIS does not support inheritance across method RequestResponse types, while it supports it for parameter types. Please share your experiences on this matter. p  pIf you have any definiteprecise answer with a link to documentationsources of AXIS this will be just great.p  pThanks in advance, Antonp

Negative 4330 pI have an multiple assembly C Excel addin which passes embedded interop types across assembly boundaries. When I run this in an Excel process configured to use .NET 3.5, everything is OK. When I run this in an Excel process configured to use .NET 4.0, only controls with application logic defined in the addin assembly itself load. I think I understand why, since the handling of embedded interop types changed significantly in .NET 4.0, so that they must not cross assembly boundaries. What confuses me is that I thought in .NET 4.0 multiple instances of the CLR could be hosted in a single Windows process. If my addin targets .NET 3.5, why cant it just run in a .NET 3.5 CLR instance owned by Excel Why is Excel trying to run my addin in .NET 4.0 Its not really an option to rewrite the addin, but it needs to install for a client who also use .NET 4.0 addins, so its not OK to play with registry keys or the Excel.exe.config files... Any help will be REALLY appreciatedp

Negative 4330 pI have two processes which I am to synchronize.p  pProcess A is running as root and creates a ReentrantLock on a specific file.

Negative 4330 pI have built a simple Android application to solve an annoying problem. Whenever you join the wireless network at my University you are redirected to a log in page where you must provide your student number and password.p  pI have build an Android application that lets you enter your details, a service then registers a receiver with the intent filter codeWifiManager.NETWORKSTATECHANGEDACTIONcode. Whenever the device connected to the University network a HTTP post webrequest is made with the log in details. Thus solving the problem of being redirected.p  pEverything works perfectly... However in my extended testing I found a very weird issue. When I press the Go Power Master applications lightning button once and then open SettingsAppsRunning I see my service is restarting along with many other services for example Facebook. After about 30 seconds the Services restart and everything is fine once more.p  pHowever if I press the lightning button many times 3 or more in quick succession and then go to SettingsAppsRunning I no longer see my Service. Its like it has never tried to restart. The Facebook Service and other Services go thru the normal restarting phase and eventually succeed.p  pDoes anyone know what is going on Why is my Service dying forever when I press the lightning button multiple timesp  pBefore you answer know that I have changed my application to work with codestartForegroundcode and this works perfectly in all my extended testing. This is however not a valid solution because I dont want my application to have a constant notification in the status bar.p  pP.S. My project is up on github if you would like to recreate this weird issue a hrefhttpsgithub.comccoffeyNUIMWiFi relnofollowhttpsgithub.comccoffeyNUIMWiFiap  pP.P.S. The Go Power Master application is a free application on Google Play, the lightning button is supposed to reclaim lost RAM I guess it forces all background Services to die. This is certainly what it appears to do anyway.p  pstrongEdited to include LogCat logsstrongp  pOkay I have partially answered my own question. Below is the LogCat output for my Service filtered to only include ie.cathalcoffey.android. I have highlighted the lines that matter. It turns out that each time you kill a Service its restart time increases. Initially it was 135096ms, the second time I killed the Service it became 540384ms and the final time I killed the Service it became 2161536ms.p  pSo now I know why my Service appears to not restart after being killed many times in quick succession. I still dont know why the Facebook Service restarts very quickly every time its killed no increase in restart time. Any ideas on how to solve thisp  precode0508 095220.997 IActivityManager192 START    actandroid.intent.action.MAIN cat[android.intent.category.LAUNCHER]  flg0x10000000 cmpie.cathalcoffey.android.MyActivity from pid 3364 0508  095221.403 IActivityManager192 Displayed  ie.cathalcoffey.android.MyActivity 290ms total 41s557ms 0508  095301.888 IActivityManager192 Killing proc  3330ie.cathalcoffey.android10033 kill background 0508 095301.888  WActivityManager192 Scheduling restart of crashed service  ie.cathalcoffey.android.MyService in 135096ms 0508 095517.013  IActivityManager192 Start proc ie.cathalcoffey.android for service  ie.cathalcoffey.android.MyService pid3633 uid10033 gids3003 0508  095621.325 IActivityManager192 Killing proc  3633ie.cathalcoffey.android10033 kill background 0508 095621.333  WActivityManager192 Scheduling restart of crashed service  ie.cathalcoffey.android.MyService in 540384ms 0508 100521.747  IActivityManager192 Start proc ie.cathalcoffey.android for service  ie.cathalcoffey.android.MyService pid3943 uid10033 gids3003 0508  101720.786 IActivityManager192 Killing proc  3943ie.cathalcoffey.android10033 kill background 0508 101720.786  WActivityManager192 Scheduling restart of crashed service  ie.cathalcoffey.android.MyService in 2161536ms codepre  pOkay so filtering LogCat with facebook returns the following interesting information, again the interesting stuff is in bold.

Negative 4330 pWell, im designing a small affiliate system using PHP and Neo4J in order to teach myself a little more about Neo4J and how graph databases work. My original affiliate system was in MySQL and the performance gain by just migrating the design and storage to Neo4J is absurd.p  pHowever, there are some features that im probably doing VERY wrongly and im willing to see how better it could be, with some help from more experienced developers. For example, each month the system has to calculate the amount of dollars to pay to each affiliate. This follows some rules that force me to search through an entire user network. p  pFor example, in order to calculate Joes monthly pay, the system has to p  precodeFind Node Joe function Calculate   Calculate amount of people referred all tiers   Calculate the number of referral tiers all tiers   Calculate points   Store information inside object properties codepre  ul litiers Joe refers Mary who in its turn refers Bob. Mary is Tier 1, Bob is Tier 2, under Joe.li liall tiers calculate number based on Joe, Mary and Bobli ul  pSo, the Calculate function looks like a recursive function. Foreach user referred by Joe, i have to run the Calculate function on him, and any of his children, until i get back to Joe and get my numbers. p  pThis is slow as hell. I thought about using RabbitMQ or ZMQ and creating a queue for each children process of Joes calculation. I also thought about using pcntls forking. How can i make this recursive process inside my graph network better Whats the best way to go through the entire tree Queuing Process Forkingp  pAnother examplep  precodeCalculateJoe   Joe referred Mary, Bob, Peter   CalculateMary   Mary referred Sara, Megan     CalculateSara     CalculateMegan   CalculateBob   Bob referred Billy, Michael     CalculateBilly     CalculateMichael   CalculatePeter   Peter referred Charles, Max     CalculateCharles     CalculateMax codepre  pNow, multiplicate this for someone with 500 referrals, and each of his referrals can have more 500 people. Its slow as hell and i have to show this on Joes Dashboard, each month. p

Negative 4330 pI know that this question has been asked previously, but before you give me a minus and report repeated question, ponder a while on thisp  pIn all previous answers everybody says that object memory layout is compiler dependent. How is it then, that shared libraries .dll, .so can export and import c classes, and they can definitely be combined even if coming from different compilers Consider a DirectX application written under mingw. DirectX was compiled using MSVC, so how do those environments agree on memory layout I know that DirectX relies heavily on C classes and polymorphism.p  pAsking differently lets say that I have a chosen architecture eg. Windows, intel x86 and I am trying to write a new compiler. How do I know how to access class instance vtable, member fields provided by .dll lib compiled by another compiler Or is it simply like that M has written VC, and since then it is unwritten standard, and every other compiler does it the same for compatibility reasons And what about linux or other OSesp  pEDITp  pOK I admit, the example with DirectX was bad because of COM specification...p  pAnother example QT. I am using QT with mingw, but I know there are also available MSVC versions. I dont know if the difference is only in headers, or if shared libs dlls are also different. If they are, does it mean that I have to distribute my app with qt libs included, so if anybody happens to have ones for a different compiler it will not get mixedup Nice memory and code sharing then, right. Or are they the same and there is some unwritten law about it anywayp  pEDIT2p  pI have installed a different qt version msvc 2010 just to see what is and isnt shared. Seems that shared are they really shared then libraries are different. Seems that I really have to provide qtlibs with my app then... And this is no small thing eg. QtGui 89MB. What about other, smaller libs, whose authors werent so kind to provide versions for other compilers Does it mean that I am stuck with their original compiler What if I want to use two different libs that were compiled by different compilersp

I know some slowness is because of it being non power of 2 image data but my requirements dictate that.p  pMore reading led me to codeCVOpenGLESTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImagecode but all examples are of it using direct camera input to obtain a codeCVImageBufferRefcode I tried using the documentation no official yet just header comments to make my own CVImageBuffer form my image data, but it would not work with this no errors just an empty texture in the debugger, which makes me think Apple built this specifically to process realtime camera data and it has not been tested much outside of this area but IDK. p  pAnyway after giving up my dignity by dumping OpenGL and switching my thoughts to CoreGraphics I was led to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2395650fastestwaytodrawascreenbufferontheiphonefastest way to draw a screen buffer on the iphonea which recommends using a codeCGImagecode backed by codeCGDataProviderCreateDirectcode, which allows you to return a pointer to image data when the CGImage needs it, awesome right Well it doesnt seem to quite work as advertised. If I use codeCGContextDrawImagecode then everything works. I can modify the pixel buffer, and every draw, it requests the image data from my data provider like it should, calling the methods in codeCGDataProviderDirectCallbackscode codeNotecode they seem to have a built in optimization the ignores the updated pointer if it has the same address as the pervious. CGContextDrawImage is not super fast about 18 fps even with disabling interpolation which brought that up from like 6 fps. Apples docs tell me using codeself.layer.contentscode will be much faster than codeCGContextDrawImagecode. Using codeself.layer.contentscode works for the first assignment but the codeCGImagecode never requests a reload from the data provider like the codeCGContextDrawImagecode does, even when I call code[layer setNeedsDisplay]code. In the SO question I referenced the user shows his solution to the problem by creating and destroying a new CGImage from the data source every frame, a hopelessly slow process yes I did try it, so time for the real question.p  pstrongNotestrong I have profiled all these operations and know the problem really is codeglTexSubImagecode for OpenGL and codeCGContextDrawImagecode is really the problem from CoreGraphics so no go profile answers.p  pstrongEDITstrong Source code demonstrating this technique can now be found at a hrefhttpgithub.comnarpasimagesequencestreaming relnofollowhttpgithub.comnarpasimagesequencestreaminga p

The error I get is p  blockquote   pProcedure or function ... has too many arguments specifiedp blockquote  pAt first I thought it was a permission problem. I tried to give a User more and more permission until I finally made that user an Administrator and still I got that error. p  pSo my question is besides permissions what else are the differences between Admin and nonAdmin on Win Server 2008p  pThank youp

Negative 4330 pfriends. I am using AMD APU A8 3870k to do an experiment, but I found the behavior of memory allocation is a little strange. As I measured, the codeCLDEVICEMAXMEMALLOCSIZEcode for CPU device is 1GB and codeCLDEVICEGLOBALMEMSIZEcode is 2GB, I think that means I can allocate two maximum buffers, each with 1GB size. But actually I can only allocate one such buffer, and the other one can only be about 242MB report error when  243MB, ps the buffer allocation flags are both codeCLMEMREADWRITE  CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTRcode. Furthermore, if I squeeze the first buffer to be 1023MB, or 1022MB, even 900MB, I can not allocate the second buffer with 243MB or bigger. Only if I squeeze the first buffer further to be like 700MB that the second buffer can be 243MB or bigger. I know such kind of questions are a little naive, but it may affect how I set my input dataset in the future. So hope anyone can help me.p

Negative 4330 pI am looking for information on the strongiOS Enterprise Developer Program.strong From what I read, inhouse distribution allows companies to distribute iOS apps internally without knowing the devices UDIDs unlike what happens with the adhoc distribution. Apps built with these profiles can be emtechnicallyem installed on any iOS device without limits on the number of devices, but the license agreement says we cant distribute enterprise apps to anyone outside the company.p  pFrom what I read, we can distribute apps through any medium we want within the enterprise. In our case, we want to put the code.ipacode and its code.plistcodeon our intranet protected via authentication. Our users can just browse to that site with any iOS device, type in their credentials, click on the link and install the app. Thats great.p  pBut how updates work I cant find information on this topic. If I create a new version of the app, all devices are updated automatically without my interventionp

Negative 4330 pIn my applications I usually create three tables for access management. Roles, Rights and an association table that maps between Roles and Rights.p  pI am trying to translate this approach to Spring security and after reading [this article][1] I thought I was on the right track. I created a custom AuthenticationProvider and implemented the codeauthenticatecode method like sop  precodeOverride public Authentication authenticateAuthentication authentication throws AuthenticationException      UserProfile profile  userProfileService.findByEmailauthentication.getPrincipal.toString      ifprofile  null         throw new UsernameNotFoundExceptionString.formatInvalid credentials, authentication.getPrincipal           String suppliedPasswordHash  DigestUtils.shaHexauthentication.getCredentials.toString      ifprofile.getPasswordHash.equalssuppliedPasswordHash         throw new BadCredentialsExceptionInvalid credentials           UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken token  new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationTokenprofile, null, profile.getAuthorities      return token  codepre  pThe codeprofile.getAuthoritiescode method creates a list of Rights rights are wrapped in my own implementation of GrantedAuthority.  So, the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken object is created with this list. This is the UserProfile.getGrantedAuthorities method that takes care of thisp  precodepublic Collectionlt extends GrantedAuthoritygt getAuthorities      SetltProduxAuthoritygt authorities  new HashSetltProduxAuthoritygt     for Role role  roles          for Right right  role.getRights              ProduxAuthority produxAuthority  new ProduxAuthorityright.getName             authorities.addproduxAuthority                   return authorities  codepre  pMy question is whether this is a correct approach. I am getting the impression that I should stuff roles into GrantedAuthorities instead of rights, but I would like to use rights to secure methods and urls, because it gives me more fine grained control  over authorization. How would I accomplish this And what is the difference between a ROLE and a PERMISSION in Spring Do permissions map to rights and could I use hasPermission to secure stuff bases on rights instead of roles p

Negative 4330 pIm working in assembly on a homework problem, and each word is 16bit. So I have a two word 32 bit integer. The high order bits are in R1 register 1 and the lower order bits are in R0 register 0. So the number is just R1R0. Im supposed to treat it as a continuous number so imagine the number is just both combined. So I want to work with R1R0 as a positive number, so if it is negative I want to take the NOT of R1R0 and add 1 because it is a 2s complement number and doing so would turn it into a positive number. My problem is that if you took the NOT of R1R0 and R0 was a positive number previous and then became a negative number from the NOT what should I do Should I carry over from the R1 and subtract 1 from R1p

Negative 4330 pI am currently using strongAD groupsstrong to manage roles and access to Dynamics AX 2012. So for example I have and AD group called strongGGAXSalesRepresentativestrong and it is used to allow everyone in the group to log on to Dynamics AX and to receive the corresponding role in Ax.p  pSo this is working and users that log on to Dynamics Ax and are member of the group will automatically be created within Dynamics AX and receive a CA2D like userId. They have no role assignments because AX knows that they came from the AD group and the roles are defined on the group itself. Thus management of users through groups is ok and working.p  pBut now I need to provide a Custom service to a third party that returns all of the legal entities where a role assignment for a given user is active. Fe I want to pass a UserId to the service and it must check if that user is service desk user and if zo, check in what legal entities.....p  pstrongUser datastrong can be found in the strongUserInfo tablestrong. strongUser role assignmentsstrong can be found in the strongSecurityUserRole tablestrong.p  pIt seems I would have the data I need, except for the fact that the User Role assignments are done on the group How can I find which groups this user is linked to within Dynamicsp  pSo what I want to know  I have user CA2D, he is member of the helpdesk role since he was a member of that group and thus he has the roles linked to that AD group.p  pAny ideas would be welcome p

The implementation of this class is done in X.h and Y.h. Both of them contain different definitions of the member functions. But the inclusion of one these files is done conditionally using ifdef in the program. So if a certain condition is satisified, X.h is includeed, else Y.h is includeed. Both of them are never included together. Heres the problem I need to change this compiletime toggle to runtime toggle.

Negative 4330 pI have an application that needs to geocode a large number of addresses at a time 1500.  Im using the Javascript Google Maps API Library v3 to retrieve the latitude and longitude, and the information is being stored in a MySQL database for later use.p  pObviously this is taking a while.. My code puts the addresses into an array, then calls a recursive function on the array.  The function takes each address and attempts to geocode it.  If the geocode is successful, the function continues with the next address.  If the geocode returns codeZERORESULTScode, the function continues with the next address.  If the geocode returns codeOVERQUERYLIMITcode, the function uses codesetTimeoutcode to pause for a set amount of time stored in codevar timeoutcode, then retries again.p  pNow Ive tried many different values for codetimeoutcode, and they differ in how well they work.. The best was probably code2000code, or two seconds, and that allowed me to geocode around 365 addresses.  However, once the program has coded around 250 addresses, it slows completely down, to the point where it is coding 1 address every 10 seconds.. p  pSo.. Does anyone know how to speed up this process  I also currently have a counter that checks how many times the function is called on the same address to track how many codeOVERQUERYLIMITcode errors are received before the address is coded.  Should I perhaps delay for 2 seconds normally, and then if the same address receives codeOVERQUERYLIMITcode 10 times, delay for 30 seconds or somethingp  pAny help is much appreciated Cheersp

Negative 4330 pI am currently designing a system where I have the following problemp  pI have a webapplication, running on an own Windows server. And i have an external client who has to communicate with the webapplication. The communication will go through XML files. The client is making one XMLfile with some data which the application has to read and process. My problem is that I have no idea if there are best practises for this problem. p  pI am thinking about the following solution for this problem The client is sending the XMLfile to a directory on the server. This directory is being watched by the application and when a new XMLfile is being added, an event occurs and the application knows that there is a new file and is going to read it and process the data. When data processing is finished, the application will remove the XML file.  p  pIs this the best solution or are there other solution for this problemp

Negative 4330 pIm using the dialog box as a search area. User clicks on add icon, and dialog pops up with text box and little search icon. When search icon is clicked, or enter is pressed while in the textbox, I would like to begin search.p  pWorks perfectly in FF 19, but in IE 9 the dialog box closes when I press enter button. I tested with a standalone HTML page , and simple dialog, with text box, and IE 9 works fine. So there is something in my code triggering IE 9 to close the dialog box.p  pI dont have a codeformcode on dialog box. It does an AJAX call for result, and when results returned , there is an Add button on the dialog box to add the selected results, via checkboxes, to a listbox below on the main page. p  pI have read a couple of queries here on Stack overflow of problems with one button on the dialog box being bound to the enter button etc, so i removed the Add button. I removed the .keypress code for text box too that fires off the search AJAX function, but still when pressing enter button dialog closes. p  pI did a codebeforeClose function event, ui code in the dialog box, and alert some event info, and while the alert box is open, I see that the codeclose button xcode on the dialog has focus.p  pHow would i go about tracing back what is triggering the close button when i press enter I tried to put breakpoint in IE debugger, at the beforeClose, and inside the beforeClose function, but IE simply does not break there.

Negative 4330 pI have written a client to a public SOAP web service, using a WSDL and several XSD files supplied by the service provider. I wanted to find an easy way to validate user data against the XSD files, so I used the standard example from MSDN, using an XmlSchemaSet for the XSD files, an XmlReader and a validation routine to catch the error messages. The code is available at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryas3tta56.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryas3tta56.aspxa It works for some data elements, but others do not throw an error when they are invalid. If I include ValidationFlags  ValidationFlags  Or XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ReportValidationWarnings, I then get a lot of warnings, e.g. Could not find schema information for the element MyRequest, Could not find schema information for the attribute TheDate, etc. But I can open the XSD files in the VS2010 IDE, and its XML Schema Explorer shows these elements and attributes.p  pSo my main question to anyone who is familiar with validating XML data in VS2010 in this way is, are there limits to the complexity of the XSD files that the XmlReader validation can handle Could the prefixes for the Target Namespaces confuse the XmlReader There are thousands of complex types defined in the schema, spread across 7 XSD files, which is why I wanted this to be handled automatically, rather than me writing a validation routine for each user input field.p  pThanks in advance.p

My aim is to replicate the local directory structure on the server. p  pI dont intend to actually create the same directory structure. I will use some sort of reference in the DB to keep track of it.

However, when I run this on my device, the codeLinearLayoutcode is REVERSED, meaning now that the codeEditTextcode is to the RIGHT of the codeImageButtoncode. The proportions and margins are still accurate though. Does anyone know what is going wrong herep  pNote Ive already cleaned and refreshed my project this was ineffective. Ive also tried removing the codelayoutgravitycode attributes, and that did nothing.p  pThanksp
Negative 4330 pIm having serious problems with Android Studio. I have totally uninstalled Android Studio, and any copies of Eclipse on my PC.

Negative 4330 pIm working on a solver to solve the recursive constraint. How the solver works is like that, for example given a sequence which is recursively defined as codean  an12  2code. then the solver will find the exactly formula representing the codeancode based on codencode. You can look at this a hrefhttpwww.wolframalpha.cominputiRSolve5B7Ba5Bn5D3D3Da5Bn15D2B28n29212Ca5B05D3D3D17D2Ca5Bn5D2Cn5D relnofollowexamplea in wolfram alpha for more understanding p  pIn programming. the program which computes the sequence is likes thisp  precode a[0]  1     for i  1 i lt n i  i1         a[i]  2a[i1]2 codepre  pThen by using our solver, I can represent codea[n]code by codencode and add this feature to constraint. However, Im sort of finding the real world examples which includes the recursive sequences or linear recurrence relation like this. Do you know any piece of code which can be my test benchp

Negative 4330 pI have created a small device that uses a small Raspberry Pi singleboard computer to allow me to remotely dispense treats to my cat and monitor him and the surroundings with a web cam. p  pThe software consist of a single Python module that hosts a web site to allow remote control of the device, a thread to manage the hardware and which runs a simple state machine, and a thread that captures pictures via the webcam and which runs a motion detect algorithm to limit captures to times when the cat is around. The web site hosts a single HTML page which contains some Javascript which uses jQuery to make Ajax callbacks to the server.p  pThe software is all working, but I have found that the web site is at times very slow to return the page on initial loading. I think the issue is the general singlethreaded nature of Python due to the GIL and the Python simple http server class design.p  pI am interested in moving the application to Twisted, but I am not sure how to port the two threads that handle the camera and the hardware state machine. Both threads run a loop, effectively polling, with a small delay between each iteration of the loop.p  pThanksp

Negative 4330 pI have an iOS app that makes images that are used in someone elses app on the AppStore that allows users to upload images. p  pThe problem is they do an overlay on the image that is black with 10 visibility alpha  0.1 a light light light grey... so if I want the image to appear as white I create a blank image that is 255,255,255 for RGB aka 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f But once its uploaded their light grey overlay goes ontop of it and that iPhone display merges the pixels while rendering which does 90 white and 10 black. So I actually get a light grey color instead of a white... so Im thinking if I can create a super white the actual data of the image file says that the color for any given pixel is 300, 300, 300 instead of the current max 255,255,255 .. then when iOS tries to render it, it will do the overlay algorithm and overlay the black by 10 which subtracts from the RGB values... but the final value although less than 300,300,300 will still be above 255,255,255 and appear as white. p  pI have a feeling this will involve editing the actual data of a png file Would this even work Is there a better way to do this Thanksp
Negative 4330 pIm using parse.com as a backend for an app, and while the API guide and quick start guides are helpful, I just cant seem to get facebookltuser linking to work.p  pIn the app, I have two sign in buttons.. one for entering the users number and password, the other to log in using facebook.  The facebook login works great, and allows users to begin using social features of the app.   The problem is when they log in with just phone numberpassword. p  pHeres my linking button codep  precode linkUserParseUser.getCurrentUser   private void linkUserfinal ParseUser user  ListltStringgt permissions  Arrays.asListemail, Permissions.User.ABOUTME if ParseFacebookUtils.isLinkeduser    ParseFacebookUtils.linkuser, permissions, this, new SaveCallback       Override     public void doneParseException ex         if ex  null          Log.dMyApp, No Exception          if ParseFacebookUtils.isLinkeduser            Log.dMyApp, Woohoo, user logged in with Facebook                 else          Log.dMyApp, ex.getMessage                  else    Log.dMyApp, user already link in with Facebook  codepre  pIf i clear my apps cache, and do a fresh install, i log in first with a dummy user I created in the Parse backend, and then click the link button.  I look at logcat, but never see any log lines indicating user was linked or not..its as if the done code never fires.  I also log in to parse and look at the fbAuth data, to see if the users facebook id shows up...nothing.p  pThe one thing that I maymay not be doing rihgt, is finishing the auth workflow, which is supposed to be in the onActivityResult method.  I put this in my calling activity Preferencesp  precodeOverride protected void onActivityResultfinal int requestCode, final int resultCode, final Intent data  super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data  if resultCode  11000   else    ParseFacebookUtils.finishAuthenticationrequestCode, resultCode, data   codepre  pMy understanding of the link feature, is that you can take a regular parse user, log them in phone number, emailpass, etc then once you have that ParseUser cached, then link to facebook using SSO and the users facebook credentials via either the facebook app, or a web page.  parsefacebookutils.link then ties the facebook user to your parse user, so that they are linked in the back end.  That way your regular user can start using facebook features.  Is this correctp  pI really hate asking for code, but if anyone has utilized this feature, can you share how you did it, or point out what I did wrong p

Negative 4330 pIm aware that global variables in most cases are not a good idea especially in OOP, but I have a need where I need to create an array that can be read by any function or class within my application basically, the array will store data that Id only like to have to read once from my MySQL database.p  pIt was suggested that I create a Variables class, but the problem I see with that is that Id have to make a public or global instance of that class anyway, so creating a class doesnt really solve my problem from what I can see I could be wrong, though.p  pHow can I create a global variable array that can be seen by all classes and methodsp

Negative 4330 pI am creating a list and displaying it in a UITableView. While viewing I want to delete an item and then save the updated list, allowing me to refresh the old list with a refresh button. I use a button to save the current list, then a refresh button to reload the data into the view.  The problem is the code within the save button always runs, even when I dont press the button.

The issue I am having is that the value for codeListCopycode is assigned even when I dont press codebtnSavecode. In this case the view is cleared. If I comment out the line codelistCopy  new ListltTasksgtcode I receive a null reference exception in the table view Data Source herep  precodepublic override int RowsInSection UITableView tableView, int section  return ListOfTasks.Count   lt exception codepre  pindicating to me that the value of codeListCopycode is empty. I thought I could make codeListCopy  ListOfTaskscode in place of codenew Listcode. But, for some reason the code is running in the save button regardless, so I am never able to save the correct list value when I want it.  Why iscodeListCopycode be assigned a value without telling it  I do not assign it a value anywhere else either. Can someone explain what is happening  Is there a different solution that I could use insteadp

I want to create another query that will take the host name from a ping a command and display the employeedepartment so we can also search by ip address instead of just host name. Im new to Access and have very little experience with VBA, so Im not sure what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 4330 pI have a relatively simple issue to solve, namely I would like to make all threads await a certain condition to happen and then proceed. It can be explained by the code belowp  precodevoid doSth shared by multiple threads ... ifconditionMet     await  procceed further resetCondition  codepre  pI do not want to use locking and conditions, as it seems unnecessary. codeCountDownLatchcode would be perfect, but I have to reset the latch, and codeCyclicBarriercode would not work either because I have no idea how many threads need to call await. Also, when the signal is sent to awaiting threads, they should all be released and proceed. How would you guys approach thisp

This event is fired    for any authentication related change, such as login, logout or session refresh. This means that    whenever someone who was previously logged out tries to log in again, the correct case below     will be handled.

In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login         like this, for two reasons        1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they         result from direct interaction from people using the app such as a mouse click        2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.       FB.login      else         In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login         function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

The server and client code have both been written, and are working as expected...p  pThe problem is, this server might be running from any machine in the local network, so I cant hard code the address in the script...

Kind of like a torrent tracker, I think. Thisll have to do if I cant do the service advertising approach easily.p

Negative 4330 pBear with me as Im stuck on what is most likely the simplest of Mule ESBJMS usecases.  Im trying to get a Mule app to accept incoming messages from an existing HornetQ Queue.  My muleconfig.xml is provided below.  My problem is this Whenever the message producer adds a message to the queue, HornetQ is reporting that the message reaches its maximum number of redelivery attempts for the given message and sends it to the deadletter queue  apparently never being accepted by the Mule JMS inboundendpoint.  This only happens when the Mule server is running it is important to note that the app gets deployed in the Mule server without issue, when it is not, of course the provider doesnt attempt any deliveries which is expected.

Negative 4330 pIm working on an ASP.NET Web API, and now Id like to implement the oauth2 protocol for the authorization to the api endpoints.p  pThe identity provider, the authorization server and the resource the api, will all be handled by our software. I do not need to implement Google, MS og Facebook login. The reason for me to choose oauth, is that Id like to use the same identity provider for futere services my company might develop. Every sample code and tutorial Ive found on the internet so far, seems to concentrete on using external identity providers, like Google, and not so much on self developed solutions. Also, they seem to include web pages for entering credentials, which is not what Id like to do. The client library should take an apikey and use this to get the necessary token for accessing the resource api. Is this even possible Or have I totally misunderstood the intended use of oauthp  pI hope my case is made clear, so please, if anyone can point me in the right direction to a code sample, tutorial or similar.p

I am using this code for something similarp  precode        function orderbyadditionaldatequery  if  isadmin ampamp querygtismainquery ampamp iscategory array 2,57,530    catisancestorof2, getqueryvarcat  ampamp querygtismainquery ampamp  isadmin  catisancestorof57, getqueryvarcat  ampamp querygtismainquery ampamp  isadmin  catisancestorof530, getqueryvarcat  ampamp querygtismainquery ampamp  isadmin       if  querygtqueryvars           querygtset order, DESC          querygtset metakey, additionaldate          querygtset orderby, metavalue         addaction pregetposts, orderbyadditionaldate  codepre  p2 things are missing from this Its not comparing 3 meta key values releasef, releaseuk and releaseus and it doesnt check if one of them is empty and use the posted date instead it just sets the value of the empty ones to Jan 1 1970p
Negative 4330 pThis may be answered elsewhere but I seem to be unable to find any information about the removal of sshKeys after they have been loaded into the instance. My question is, if I have multiple users with access to the project and they have their keys added to the project metadata how can a single user be removed from the project, including their SSH keys and if the possibility exists will those keys have to be manually removed from each individual instance in the project and if so how without the root accountp

And its rather ugly to have 10 overrides of codefcode when their bodies are the same.p  pcodeprocessorcode could be changed to anything, also codederpcode could be some container, holding a codetemplatecoded codeprocessorcode, etc.p  pIt sounds like I want to have a codevirtual templatecode member function codefcode, which is not allowed.p  pI thought about using a macro, but I dont like that idea.p  pstrongEDITstrong Note cant use c11, unfortunately. And cant change codetypeNcode types, which are not in hierarchy.p
Negative 4330 pI am attempting to migrate a PHP website over to Node.js and Im now looking at setting up the databases with Sequelize.p  pThe majority of the tables are set up OK but Im having trouble figuring out how to do normalization.p  pE.g. I have 1 database Usersp  precodeID Username Email Password codepre  pAnd another table called Domainsp  precodeID Domain RegisteredAt codepre  pAnd now I need to create a 3rd table to link to the 2 tables together for lookups like sop  precodeUserID DomainID codepre  pI have tried setting up OneToOne associations from the Sequelize documentation, but this just seems to create an extra field in the original 2 tables. Could someone explain how Id do this pleasep  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 4330 pIm in the the process of replacing the Free and Standard paypal button with a Express checkout integration. I believe Ive done most of the work but I have 2 outstanding questions.p  ol lipWhen using the old button it redirected me to an order summary page where I could still update the quantity of the product I wanted to buy. With Express checkout it seems that this option has dissapeaed. Whilst the quantity field is still there, its readonly and can therefore not be altered anymore. Can I make it so this field becomes editable againpli lipWhen i get redirected to the paypal site after pressing submitting the form is not consistent, I suspect Paypal is in the process of rolling out some updates to this page and is doing some AB testing to see which layout is performing better but it would be good if someone else could confirm a similiar behaviour and if theres anything that I can do to force a particular layout I found other posts on this forum but they were posted a while ago hence the recheck.pli ol  pThanksp

Negative 4330 pOk so in my app, there are various custom interactable pop ups appearing. However the problems begin when I need to push to the next UIViewController. To tackle this, I created a full screen UIViewController with a semitransparent background and a hidden navigation bar. I then added a navigation bar to the pop up and called the push function when the relevant button is tapped. However the result is rather ugly, as the entire UIViewController moves and not just what is below the navigation bar. What I want to do is something like the push animation on the Twitter or Facebook iOS 7 widgets, where only the actual pop up pushes. Anybody got any idea about that Ive been searching for hours, even in this site and I cant seem to find anything. p

Negative 4330 pIm playing around with Ruby and trying create a little bank account program.

Its incomplete, obviously because Im stuck on this part.  I go through a while loop and enter Create Account to start the createaccount method.  My goal is to run the conditional and require the user to type a 4 digit integer, like any ole pin number.  If it is not an integer nor 4 digits in length, I call the createaccount method to get them to start over.p  pIm running ruby 2.0.0 if that information is necessary, but I wager it is likely more to do with my code.  Stackoverflow is new to me, so I apologize if this question has been asked.  I tried to do my homework as is advised before asking a question, but Im still stumped.  Any help is appreciated.p

I have tried many different things to get it to work. This includes commenting out my constructor for codeMyDbContextcode, changing the codeproviderNamecode attribute of my connection string to be codeSystem.Data.SqlClientcode, changing the connection string name to be codeDefaultConnectioncode, removing my connection strings altogether, and combinations of all of these things. I make sure to rebuild between trying to add the Controller. However, after performing these different changes, I still receive the same error when I try to add a new Controller.p  pGenerally, I can find all my questions already answered, but the answers dont seem to be working for me on this one. I think what might separate my case from the ones linked is that my codeDbContextcode is actually an instance of codeIdentityDbContextcode. I believe the constructor for codeIdentityDbContextcode just calls the base constructor for it, anyway, so I dont see how this could be much of an issue.p  pAny help is much appreciated. Thank youp

When I want to delete, First, I delete the item from the codeSQlite DataBasecode then go through the same procedure again, which is, calling codeString[] retrieveMPLNamescode which will retrieve the available data from the codeSQlite DataBasecode and the returned codeArraycode will be converted into codeArrayListcode then bind it to the codeArrayAdaptercode.

Negative 4330 pIm trying to get a Kendo UI combo box to load data from the server as I type. Client is an Input box. I need the id of the item in the textbox saved, which is why I am using a combo box instead of autocomplete. When I type into the combo box it always sends the string that is 1 keypress behind the data in the input box. I assume this happens because the shadowed Kendo UI input box doesnt update the original input box until after the call to the server is already made.p  pAlso, If I dont use the parameterMap code, nothing that is typed in the input box is sent to the server. And, I would expect that the filter condition would be sent too. I have looked at the examples on Telriks site and they show to use the filters from the request parameters to see the data, but when I use fiddler or any other tracing tool, I can see that nothing is sent in the request that has anything to do with the data from the Kendo UI server call. This should be a relativity easy thing to do, but Im stumped.p  pEDIT I changed it to a kendoAutoComplete and everything works as I would expect an AutoComplete to work. It shouldnt be any different than the ComboBox for implementation other than the return for the dataValueField.p  precode        Client.kendoComboBox             dataTextField label,             displayValueField id,             suggest true,             autoBind false,             minLength 1,             highlightFirst true,             filter contains,             dataSource new kendo.data.DataSource                 serverFiltering true,                 transport                      read  url searchclient, dataType json, type POST ,                     parameterMap function data                          return  search Client.val                                                              codepre

Negative 4330 pThis is my first S.O. question so thanks for taking a look. Im open to ideas and criticisms of the constructive kind.p  pMy issue is this I have a jQuery UI Accordion Widget in the main content area, and a sidebar menu with links that need to correspond to each accordion header so there is a possibility of being able to deeplink from the left sidebar menu to an item in the accordion. Not the greatest UI, and defeats the purpose of the accordion in a waymdashthis I already know. However, I still feel it would be useful to figure out this array functionality for other applications.p  pThe website is in Wordpress, so the accordion elements and sidebar links will be added or removed by the client using a custom post type. Therefore, this is the approach Ive settled on using arrays. Please let me know if you can think of an easiermore efficient way to handle the issue.p  pMy accordion code looks like this Ive stripped out the WPQuery loop for brevityp  precodeltdiv idaccordiongt   lth1gtltphp thetitle gtlth1gt   ltdivgtltphp thecontent gtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pMy left sidebar code looks like this again, Ive stripped out the loop p  precodeltul classresourcesnavgt   ltligtlta hrefgtltphp thetitle gtltagtltligt ltulgt codepre  pNow, when Wordpress and the accordion widget do their work on page load, they generate this code for the header elementp  precodelth1 classuiaccordionheader uistatedefault uicornerall uiaccordionicons roletab iduiid1 ariacontrolsuiid2 ariaselectedfalse ariaexpandedfalse tabindex0gt   ltspan classuiaccordionheadericon uiicon uiicontriangle1egtltspangt   The title from Wordpress lth1gt codepre  pAs you can see, it generates the header ID of codeiduiid1code. For each header element in the accordion, this ID changes to codeiduiid3code, then codeiduiid5code, etc. In order to deeplink from the left sidebar, Ive decided to grab the ID attribute from each header element and put it into an array, like thisp  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction     var navLi  .resourcesnav li a   var aHeader  accordion h1    var n  []  Sidebar nav items   var a  []  Accordion items    Get Nav items and store in an array   navLi.eachfunction      n.pushthis       Get Accordion header items and store in array   aHeader.eachfunction      var id  this.attrid     a.pushid        Add id from each Accordion header to href of each nav link.    This will create deep linking possibilities, right Well...   .eacha, functioni, val      console.logi     val Just for me to see that its working     navLi.attrhref, val      codepre  pAs you can hopefully see, Im trying to map each individual ID in the codeacode array to each individual link in the sidebar. However, my result ends up being that it only adds the final ID in the array to each codehrefcode, like thisp  precode  ltligt     lta hrefuiid33gtTitle of Postltagt   ltligt   ltligt     lta hrefuiid33gtTitle of Postltagt   ltligt codepre  pAny ideas why this is not workingp

Negative 4330 pI want to store my map into multiple files and be able to get that data later on. The map is sort of infinite, noise generated map. The map is chopped into chunks. Noise generation arguments has a seedvalue  XYZ so I can easily regenerate that same chunk again. Each chunk has its own c script which has 3dimensional bytearray map[x,y,z] and the value will tell me what block belongs to that spot. XYZ coords are world coords and not chunk coords, meaning there wont be same map[x,y,z] value even if I combine all of them together.p  pI want this app to be available also in mobile platforms so I want to generate map in my apps dedicated server and send chunk data over network when requested. While this reduces CPU usage of clients it also gives me extra security against hacks. I can run checks if player is loading chunks validly, players wont be able to scan whole map and see where all good stuff is, etc.p  pI read about storing a multidimensional bytearray into the file and read from it later.

Negative 4330 pIm trying to figure out how to build a specific algorithm ultimately implemented in PHP, but thats less important, but Im having a hard time wrapping my head around the best way to do the math.  Instead of defining a complex industryspecific process, Ill use a crazy metaphor here the math is whats important.  Imagine youre trying to identify the percent chance a specific make of car is parked in a stores parking lot based on the items sold within the store.  To begin you take a physical survey of 100,000 store parking lots, recording each unique car make spotted outside, each unique item sold within the store, and a fixed percent relevance that item has to the store ex lumber has an 89 relevance to Home Depot, but pencils only have a 23 relevance to Walmart.p  pThere are two parts to what Im trying to solve.  First, Im trying to figure out the best way to rollup this data to a specific item, while respecting each relevance percent and the number of confirmed observations so one spotting doesnt equal 100 chance, similar to a hrefhttpwww.evanmiller.orghownottosortbyaveragerating.html relnofollowhttpwww.evanmiller.orghownottosortbyaveragerating.htmla .  In other words, if a brand new, neverbeforeseen store is  selling Waterford glasses and cashmere sweaters, from those items we can predict theres an 89 chance a Mercedes is in the parking lot.p  pSo to recap Each item has been seen a specific number of times in a store.  For each of those times, there is a different productstore relevance percentage and a list of all car makes in the parking lot.  How do I best mathematically calculate the percent chance a specific make is in the parking lot of a brand new store, only based on the items withinp  pNow the second part of this is getting a bit more complicated by adding another layer of abstraction.  If a single person visits 50 stores, and we aggregate all the items in all those stores, we can predict what type of car they drive ex lots of camping and hiking stores, so they have a 67 chance of driving a Jeep.  Then if they visit a new store and are exposed to a brand new item, for which we have no data, I need to apply that 67 Jeep onto the new item still respecting the relevance of that item to the store.  Then use that items lessthancertain Jeep statistic to influence our predictions of parking lots that contain that new item which was never directly measured.  Perhaps this requires us to add a confidence interval of some kind  Or how can we represent that uncertainty, without every one of the millions of items we analyze eventually averaging out to 50p  pI REALLY appreciate your help on thisp

Negative 4330 pSo I have a site built using the Kentico CMS. On page load, sometimes the scroll bars will not show up in Chrome on Mac. They do show up in Safari, reliably. I previously had this issue with Safari, and addedp  precodehtml      overflowy scroll  codepre  pto my css, and that seemed to fix it. Its not working for Chrome, however.p  pI did notice that if I open up the dev console and then close it, it gains a scroll bar. If I change the CSS of an element to be width 99, rather than 100, it gains a scroll bar. However, this only works if I change the CSS that targets that element. If I change it just for that element either with javascript or by modifying the element.style through the console, it does not gain a scroll bar.p  pThere are no JavaScript errors upon opening the console.p  pMy thought was to try to change the CSS itself with JavaScript, but Im not positive how to do that.p  pDoes anyone have any other ideas Or how I could accomplish my planp  pI unfortunately cant reduce the problem any further. It seems to be the interaction of the whole site, including Kentico, so it doesnt seem possible to get a jsfiddle or anything.p

The way I expected this to unfold was on the initial yourturn call, RSpec would stub playon, return nil, setting off the unless statement and repeating the yourturn call  after which it would return a symbol and prevent any further recursion. What have I misunderstoodp  pAfter that effort, I came up with a monstrosity that seems to work, but Im not entirely sure whyp  blockquote   pallowhuman.to receivegetrow.andreturn1,2p      pallowhuman.to receivegetsquare.andreturn2,2p      pallowhuman.to receivesquareat.with1, 2.andreturnnilp      pallowhuman.to receivesquareat.with2, 2.andreturnsquarep      pallowhuman.to receiveplayon.withsquare.andreturnsquarep      pexpecthuman.to receiveplayon.twicep      phuman.yourturnp blockquote  pThe trouble here other than this being ugly is I got it to work more through brute force than understanding, and theres a couple of things Im not sure ofp  ul liWhy can I not remove eg the first two lines without the prompt returning to RSpec Since on the third and fourth lines Im stubbing the method squareat, which would call the get methods, why are they still being called li liSimilarly, the fifth line third and fourth line seemed to cover the third and fourth, but I initially had the last allow returnnil, square, expecting that to work. That ended up calling yourturn three times where I was expecting two, so I removed the nil and it passed. The way I parse it, without the nil, playon will return square immediately, so the unless logic wont be triggered and the method will terminate. Again, what have I misunderstoodli liIs there a dryer way of dealing with the two squareat allowing linesli ul  pThanks all,p  pSashap

Negative 4330 pI have written the below code outline, basically to sum an array a where each element is multiplied by a value xip  precodey  a0 i  0 y  sum from i0 to n1 ai  xi AND 0 lt n lt a.length Invariant  while i lt n1 y  sum from i0 to n1 ai  xi AND 0 lt n lt a.length AND i lt n1 y  y  aixi i  i  1 end while  y  sum from i0 to n1 ai  xi Postcondition codepre  pNote that I do not expect the code to compile  its just a sensible outline of how the code should work. I need to improve the efficiency of the code by using a tracking variable, and thus, a linking invariant to bridge said variable with the rest of the code. This is where I am stuck. What would be useful to track in this case I have thought about retaining sum values at each iteration, but Im not sure if that does the trick. If I could figure out what to track, Im pretty sure it would be trivial to link it to the space. Can anyone see how my algorithm might be improved via a tracking variablep

But I simply strongcannot openstrong documents from stronghorsegmail.comstrong in google docs for editing because beavergmail.com is signed in on my local machine. The best I can do is getting to a point where it shows me the document, with the right account logged in in the top right corner of the screen, but asks me to signin with a button. When I click the button it just refreshes and give me the same message and the same screen.p  pWhat Ive tried isp  ol liSimply redirecting the user to the file resources codealternateLinkcode from the APIli liTaking the codealternateLinkcode and appending my codeaccesstokencode to it and then redirect the user to it. and a ton of other random things I found various places that didnt work. li ol  pIn both cases I have also tried signing out from all google accounts.p  pNow I checked a couple of webservices like Jollicloud and Odrive that tries something similar. However, both of them appear to force the user to login to google to access a file.p  pIs it really true that you can do all kinds of crazy things with the users files like deleting and downloading, but you cant open them in Google Docs own apps p  pNot completely sure what kind of code I should add to show you what Ive got. But heres some. This is my open action what happens when the user clicks on a file and wants to open the file in the Google DocsSheetetc. the orientdb stuff is because were using the OrientDB graph database  it just fetches an account where we store the tokens.

Negative 4330 pIm developing a hybrid app and wondering if this scenario is feasible.p  pI dont know the word for this... Imagine a Fulcrum, the middle of the device is on top of it. The top part of the device moves up or down, the lower part of the device moves opposite.p  pMy question is Is there a way to detect these changes, and move a circular gradient radius depending on  which movement it of the device it is.p  pPerhaps this is possible using CSS instead of JSp  pAnd how do I use the canvas to update the change in real time Expensive to runp
Negative 4330 pIm sitting down with doctrine for the first time and trying to use some of its command line tools on an existing sitedatabase. Ive played with the mapping and entity reverseengineering tools from the command line and wanted to see what kind of files it would generate from an existing website in phpmysql.p  pHowever, it stops on any Exceptions. I was already able to create a type mapping for enum to just throw them to a string for now, but now its stopping me on tables that do not have a primary ID key specified. Im not interested in a lecture on using primary keys or compound keys in link tables, Im just trying to generate some output while learning Doctrine at the moment.p  pIs there a way to either tell doctrine to skip tables that are throwing exceptions or to barrel through without stopping when it hits them I just want some sample output at the moment and dont want to entirely refactor a complex database just to see what Doctrine can do.p  pSWp
Negative 4330 pIm attempting to use codeNSURLSessioncode to handle basic authentication. It seems like codeNSURLSessioncode handles most of the authentication process, but Im struggling to find a concrete example or fully understand the documentation.p  pIve created an object conforming to codeNSURLSessionDelegatecode, and codeNSURLSessionDataDelegatecode. Upon receiving codeURLSession task didReceiveChallenge completionHandlercode delegate method, I can call the completion block with a newly created credential and then continue to make additional requests. Everything works fine.p  pIn reality, the app obviously wont immediately have the necessary credentials. So, Ive created a view controller with a login form, and presented it. The completion block is passed along to the view controller and is fired when the user presses sign in. Is this how codeNSURLSessioncode is intended to be used Im having some other curious issues, but before investigating them further I wanted to know if I was doing something completely absurd.p

Negative 4330 pIOS newb coming from PHPMySQL background confused about relationship between how to manage data for table view and detail view.p  pApples tutorial and others walk you through creating a data model for a table view.  However, when it comes to the detail view, Apple suggests using static cells. I cant seem to find a straight explanation of where you store the data for the detail view.p  pFor table view, I have following in data modelp  precodeinterface tableItem  NSObject  property NSString itemName property NSString itemSub property NSString itemPic property BOOL completed property readonly NSDate creationDate  end codepre  pand in tablecontroller.m something like following to display table viewp  precodevoidloadInitialData      tableItem item1  [[tableItem alloc] init]     item1.itemName  Buy milk     item1.itemSub  test identify image here    item1.itemPic pic.jpg     [self.tableItems addObjectitem1]     tableItem item2  [[tableItem alloc] init]     item2.itemName  Buy eggs     [self.tableItems addObjectitem2]     tableItem item3  [[tableItem alloc] init]     item3.itemName  Read a book     [self.tableItems addObjectitem3]       UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierListPrototypeCell forIndexPathindexPath]       Configure the cell...     tableItem tableItem  [self.tableItems objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      cell.textLabel.text  tableItem.itemName     cell.detailTextLabel.text  tableItem.itemSub  ...        return cell  codepre  pBut for the detail view, the Apple tutorial says to use static cells in the storyboard.

Negative 4330 pIm trying to write a shell script in Kali Linux with Debian 7.6 x8664 and GNOME 3.4.2, that changes the background desktop wallpaper each time the system boots getting the files from a directory and selecting them randomly and in a time interval, something like a service or a daemon. I dont want to have to execute it by terminal manually each time I boot, and this is the reason because I opened a question that is very similar like others in this site but not the same. What I do was to put the next line in rc.local before the exit 0 line sh etcmyscriptswallpaper, wallpaper script contents the code I wrote down. But it doesnt nothing. I think that the problem is that the operating system cant identify the user effective and real UID and GID, because im not executing the script by terminal and it cant access to the environment variables , and as result it doesnt know who creates the process and not changes the wallpaper. I did a C program using the functions seteuid, setuid, setegid, setgid and the system function running the same line I putted in rc.local, it doesnt worked too. I tried to LSBize the script too and copy it into etcinit.d directory, and create the symbolic links to the etcrcX.d directories with the updaterc.d command, and programs like desktopnova or cortina that doesnt works too. So, what can I do to reach my goal                                                    Thanks and sorry for my English and extensive text.p  precodebinsh  wallpaperchanger      wallpapershomelinuxsoldierPicturesFavorites2     while true     do         wallpaperls wallpapers  shuf n1          gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background pictureuri filewallpaper         sleep 15m     done   wallpaperchanger amp To run it in background. codepre

Negative 4330 pIve been reading about different ways to pass parameters between beans with JSF 2 and I dont really know which one would be the best for this scenario.p  pLets say I have a process with 67 views, and each one has a go back button to return to the previous view where I want to recover the data it had.p  pOne option would be to use a session bean where we store all the data, but I cannot do it because we have too many different processes.p  pI would like to have 1 bean per view, so I dont have every single process in one single view bean.p  pSome views have too much data to recover when we return to them, so I dont want to send them as request params, the url would be too long.p  pWhat else could we do using JSF2 We use Omnifaces and Primefaces too.p  pExample of viewsbeans.p  ul liViewA with 20 inputFields  BeanA to search in the database with the input data from ViewA and show the results in a table in ViewA. li liViewB to access to the details from one of the results selected in ViewA  BeanB to formatprocess the details selected.li liViewC with a form to edit some of the details  BeanC to manage the details li liViewD with a history of the modifications  BeanD to manage the history.li ul  pEach View has a button to return to the previous one ViewD  ViewC  ViewB  ViewA.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4330 pI have a python program coderuntests.pycode that executes test scripts also written in python one by one. Each test script may use threading.p  pThe problem is that when a test script unexpectedly crashes, it may not have a chance to tidy up all open threads if any, hence the test script cannot actually complete due to the threads that are left hanging open. When this occurs, coderuntests.pycode gets stuck because it is waiting for the test script to finish, but it never does.p  pOf course, we can do our best to catch all exceptions and ensure that all threads are tidied up within each test script so that this scenario never occurs, and we can also set all threads to daemon threads, etc, but what I am looking for is a catchall mechanism at the coderuntests.pycode level which ensures that we do not get stuck indefinitely due to unfinished threads within a test script. We can implement guidelines for how threading is to be used in each test script, but at the end of the day, we dont have full control over how each test script is written.p  pIn short, what I need to do is to stop a test script in coderuntests.pycode even when there are rogue threads open within the test script. One way is to execute the shell command codekillall 9 lttestscriptnamegtcode or something similar, but this seems to be too forcefulabrupt.p  pIs there a better wayp  pThanks for reading.p
Negative 4330 pBackground Im creating a modrepacker that packs them into a .zip archive style .scs file same thing, just renamed. However I noticed those that are packed with my application do not work in the game.p  pReasearch  After doing some personal research I noticed that the game only reads file entries, and doesnt see the folders like it needs to. Similarly, PeaZip, just shows all of the files in one place, with no folder structure, but when in explorer, everything is structured normally, then if I look for archive entries using IO.Compression, it does the same as PeaZip amp the game and only includes file entries, and the relative paths are there, but not counted by any other application.p  pQuestion Can anyone tell me why the folder structure appears to be exploreronly and how I can make it so the zip file retains folder objects, thus making it compatible across my application, explorer amp the game, or failing that, another library that produces zip files that have folders visible to applications like PeaZip. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4330 pI want to create a megamenu in bootstrap. p  pSomething like jsfiddle.netapougherydcMQ. But the items are not predefined... they are dynamic in nature. So I cant use codeltulgtltligtcode with some fixed items in it. So I am looking for some dynamic approach where multiple codeltligtcode items will be defined under one single codeltulgtcode element and the height need to be fixed. Once the height crosses the limit, next codeltligtcode elements should come in next column and so on... Can this be donep  pEdited Basically I am looking for a way where the height is fixed and width per column is fixed. If the number of lines cross the fixed height, they should go into the next column automatically. For Ex If the height is 400px which allows only 10 lines Just an example. If I write 25 lines... it should span into 3 columns automatically with first column having 110 lines, second column having 1120 lines and third column having 2125 lines.p

The method I am currently using works just fine under Mozilla Firefox, but does not work under Google Chrome.p  pHere is the JS file that handles the AJAX request p  precode     sendServiceRequest.js handles ajax request for     dynamically loading data  function sendServiceRequestfile, nvpSendData, successCallback, failCallback      .ajax         type POST,         url file,         data nvpSendData,         dataType html     .successfunctiondata, status          console.log.done         console.logReturn AJAX status   status         console.logsuccess data   JSON.stringifydata         successCallbackdata, status     .failfunctiondata, status, error          console.log.fail         console.logReturn AJAX status   status         console.logReturn data   JSON.stringifydata         failCallbackdata, status, error         function sendSortServiceRequestsearchType, fromDate, toDate, searchString, column, order      sendServiceRequest         searchgetcontent.php,         actionsort, searchtypesearchType, fromdatefromDate, todatetoDate, searchstrsearchString, colcolumn, orderorder,         functiondata, status              resultscontainer.htmldata         ,         functiondata, status, error            console.log.fail           console.logReturn AJAX status status                codepre  pThe first function, emsendServiceRequestem, is what initially loads the search results into the div element. p  pAnd here is a fragment of the code that is dynamically loaded into a div element, the selection element that triggers an event upon clicking on an option p  precodeltdiv classcolsm9 alignrightgt                 ltlabel forchargeauthsortselectgtSort Byltlabelgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcolsm3 stylepadding0margin0gt                 ltselect classsortselect idchargeauthsortselect stylewidth100 padding0 margin0gt                 lt selection options with datasets for identifying column and order for sorting gt                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 0, ltphp echo sortArgs[0][order] gtgt                         Status                     ltoptiongt                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 1, ltphp echo sortArgs[1][order] gtgt                         Order ID                     ltoptiongt                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 2, ltphp echo sortArgs[2][order] gtgt                         User ID                     ltoptiongt                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 3, ltphp echo sortArgs[3][order] gtgt                         Order Date                     ltoption                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 4, ltphp echo sortArgs[4][order] gtgt                         Last Updated                     ltoptiongt                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 5, ltphp echo sortArgs[5][order] gtgt                         Insurance Type                     ltoptiongt                     ltoption onClicksendSortServiceRequestchargeauth, ltphp echo fromDate gt, ltphp echo toDate gt, ltphp echo searchString gt, 6, ltphp echo sortArgs[6][order] gtgt                         Delivery Method                     ltoptiongt                 ltselectgt             ltdivgt codepre  pSo after the results are loaded into the div element of the parent page, the user can select a field option from the selection list.

Negative 4330 pWe want to build a Java app associated with files and URLs, but only one instance should run at a time. If a second file is opened, it should be handled by an already running instance, if available. Think of this as a file viewer a user clicking a link in a browser opens the app, clicking a second link brings the same app to the front and opens the second URL in a new view.p  pTo that end, my plan wasp  ul liUser calls codeapp file1.extcode. This starts the first instance.li liThis instance detects it is the only instance running, continues launch and opens codefile1.extcode.li liUser calls codeapp file2.extcode. This starts the second instance.li liSecond instance detects it is the second instance and sends a command to open codefile2.extcode to the first instance.li liFirst instance receives that command from second instance, opens codefile2.extcode, and confirms.li liSecond instance aborts launch and exits.li ul  pI can think of a variety of technologies for implementing the communication channel, but all of them open a port on the local machine. That is fine, but I want to make sure only the current user can use this port. I can probably prevent a second user from sending commands to the first users app accidentally, but how do I enforce that a port or whatever is used for the interprocess communication is available only to the user who initiates the first app launchp  pThe solution should be as platform independent as possible.p

Negative 4330 pSo I have an odd issue while trying to use a WPF TextBox with SpellCheck enabled inside a Winforms form, using the custom control defined in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4024798tryingtousethecsharpspellcheckclass40261324026132this posta.br This works just fine, Ive tried using it in my own sandbox project and it looks great. The problem is when I try to replace the Winforms TextBoxes inside one of our existing forms. The SpellCheck context menu is trapped inside the control, so all I can see are the updown arrows of the menu. br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comP2rLT.png altenter image description herebr Im not too familiar with Winforms, as I mostly work with WPF, so Im having a hard time determining the problem. The text box shown above is the custom control as mentioned in the linked post. The control is contained in a forms TableLayoutPanel. How can I get the context menu to expand and actually be visiblep  pstrongEditstrong br First, to clarify, the context menu appears normally when displayed in a console application that opens the form. I did a little more testing and created a new web project what the original problem project is with a button that opens the form, and emthenem the problem behavior occurs. What difference between the console application and the web application would cause this br brstrongEdit 2strongbr I tried the suggestions in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8412747contextmenuiscutinsomesituationsinwpfposta, thinking maybe the context menu really was just being automatically sized incorrectly to fit the parent control. But none of those solutions seemed to make any difference either.  brbrstrongEdit 3strongbr After using snoop to look at the differences between the working context menu windows application and the notworking one xbap the only difference I could see was that the DesiredSize of the xbap instances context menu has a smaller size, I just have no idea why. p

Negative 4330 pI am trying to send mobile push notifications to GCM via AWS SNS. According to the latest a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingdownstreampayload relnofollowGCM 3.0 documentationa, one may include either a notification payload or a data payload or both. If you send a notification payload, then GCM will take care of showing the notification on the enduser device for you.p  pUsing the Amazon SNS Console, I tried sending a notificationonly payload, but I encountered the following error    p  blockquote   pInvalid parameter Message Reason Invalid notification for protocol   GCM data key is expected in the json message Service AmazonSNS   Status Code 400 Error Code InvalidParameterp blockquote  pIm sendingp  precode   GCMnotificationtitleTest Message  codepre  pI suspect this might be an issue with SNS still conforming to a previous version of GCM and therefore it expects a data key, but Im not sure. Is anyone else having a similar problem or have any experience with this Thanksp  pEDIT To clarify, I want to send GCM a notification payload and have it display an alert to the user automatically as described in the documentation. Right now, Im beginning to wonder if SNS is even forwarding the notification payload to the device.p

Negative 4330 pI am going through an old site adding autocompleteoff onto passwords fields, ensuring they are hashed and so on to try and increase security.p  pHowever how can I stop passwords being stored if chosen by the user in the browser. As if someone left their computer unlocked they could easily get into an admin login due to the username and password being prefilled even with autocompleteoff on the input boxes.p  pI thought I could use JavaScript to check for the existence of a value in the password field e.g when the browser fills it and then remove it. But to check for a value you need to change the type of the input box to text and once you change it back to password the browser fills the boxes up again with values.p  pIs there anyway to stop this as I would have thought that this could be a security hole for those people who use the same passwords etc as you could just change the DOM element to text, view the value in plain text, then try on other sites the same value.p  pThe code I was trying to use was this where p  pgetEl  an old cross browser function for document.getElement DOM  my own DOM on load functionp  precodefunction clearPSW      var pgetElstrPassword     p.setAttributetype,text     console.logvalue is   p.value      if I exit here without changing back BOTH username and password fields      remain blank  although the PSW field is now a text field.     return     ifp.value              console.logclear         p                  as soon as I do this the browser refills the input boxes     p.setAttributetype,password   DOMfunction     console.logrun DOM     setTimeout1000,clearPSW  codepre  pIs there any method at all or is down to the user to be clever and not store passwords in browsers etc Obviously I am trying to handle these insecure people and force them to reenter their password each time.p  pThanksp

Negative 4330 pIm investigating a range of symptoms that happen when my web application has to be restarted The restart is slow and often the first or even the first few requests are answered with a generic error coming from IIS rather than my application.p  pI should also add that Im really using Azure Web Apps.p  pThis is just the background, this question really is about IIS diagnostics logging and how to figure out what IIS is really doing on the inside. I know about the request log, the application log and failed requests trace log.p  pThe first only gives the requests, the second only various errors and the last only records on failures.p  pWhat Id really like to have would be a log that contains events forp  ul liAppPools Begin taking down, finished taking down, starting up, finished JITting, first request handledli liRequests All the events failed request tracing is logging, but even for those requests that succeed and only doing that in certain profiling sessions, obviously  its going to be a lot of datali ul  pIs there something I missed Is there an API I can use to write logging like this myself and put it in IISp

Negative 4330 pWhile writing a controller interceptor using the codeWithcode annotation, I figured that the codecallcode method of the associated codeActioncode contains a parameterized codeHttp.Contextcode. Since we can always refer to the current codeHttp.Contextcode via the codeHttp.Context.currentcode call which is execution context safe as well, why does Plays codecallcode method have that as the parameter Just wondering...am I missing something herep

Negative 4330 pWhat I want to do is when I press a certain keyboard button or combination, a touch event should be fired with given screen coordinates.p  pI would like to use a physical keyboard connected to an Android device. I want to write code which runs in the background continuously and listens for a specific combination and then when it is pressed a touch event is created with specific coordinates. The touch event should be received by whatever app which is in foreground.p  pTo be more specific, I find it annoying that the Facebook Messenger app does not send messages when I press enter but inserts a newline in the textbox. Or at least it would be nice to have an option to enable or disable this feature, like the Windows Phone version of the app. But it does not have this option, and it drives me crazy when I type my messages on the physical keyboard and have to touch the little button on the phone itself, moving my hand from the keyboard, or I have to use tabbing navigation to select the button control and then press enter.p  pThis app would primarily be for personal use, and I am asking this question to make sure that it is even possible to write such code and to improve my knowledge.p

Negative 4330 pI have a GridView with a customizeable filter implemented with RowFilter. For each column, the user can specify a filter criterium. Once all the desired criteria have been set, he clicks on Apply filter. The criteria for all columns are combined to create the RowFilter expression of the DataView.p  pNow, I want to implement a Reverse option a check box which would simply reverse the RowFilter condition of the DataView. My first thought was to simply say  p  precodeRowFilter  NOT original condition codepre  pand that would be it. Apparently not, because of fields with NULL values. For example, if the filter has the condition codeStatusID  10code, and if some records have the NULL value for StatusID, the condition codeNOT StatusID  10code will not include those records according to my tests. For one field, I could easily make the change to account for NULL but, when several fields are combined in the condition, it becomes more complicated.p  pMy question is there a clever way to globally reverse the RowFilter condition when fields with NULL values are involved, or do I have to test for NULL for each individual fieldp
