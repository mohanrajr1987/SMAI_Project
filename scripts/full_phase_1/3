Positive 3 pBrowser users are used to zooming content when it is too small.  This increases the detail on text and SVGs.

I figure I will need to use scripts for that, right Specifically, when the mouse cursor hovers over a preset, the div element will momentarily express the details of that preset in this case, a different color and when the preset is selected, the div element will change its current color to that of the selected preset.pli lipI plan on expanding on this by having the user select a preset for the div element and send the form to save it on a database. Given the functionalities I want, will I have trouble pulling this off in terms of browser compatibilitypli ol

Positive 3 pSo Im hooking into an application api that returns a flat array of values  the order of the values defines the specific structure of data, and Id like to be able to transform this array into an object that reflects this underlying structure.p  pWorking backward, this is what Id like to end up withp  precodeappnameappX,  affectednodes  [                        nodenamenodeX,nodeidxxx,                        nodenamenodeY,nodeidyyy                     ]  codepre  pBut this is what Im givenp  precode[appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] codepre  pThe actual data is much more complex, with multiple tiers of attribute arrays nested within each other. As you can see, Im given the length of each nested attribute in the original flat array, represented in my example as code2code. Ive started wrangling with transforming the flat array into a proper object structure and the whole business seems very inefficient and difficult to maintain. My approach currently looks something like thisp  precodevar arr  [appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] var obj    obj.appname  arr[0]  var numnodes  arr[1]  obj.affectednodes  []  var position  1  forvar i  0 i lt numnodes i     var subobj       subobj.nodename  arr[position  1]     subobj.nodeid  arr[position  2]     obj.affectednodes.pushsubobj     position  position  2  codepre  pThis is working, but I feel like there may be a more efficient solution out there that hasnt occurred to me.

Negative 3 pI need to generate a WCF proxy for a service exposed by our client. The service is locked down pretty tightly, so this is proving difficult. Also, Im new to WCF, so I may be missing something obvious...brbrp  pThe client has only opened up their firewall to our production server  so I cant generate the proxy from Visual Studio on my dev machine. Also, the service is only exposed over HTTPS. And it requires us to authenticate using a client certificate...p  pI was hoping to run svcutil on the production box to generate the .cs files, and then copy the files locally.

It gives me the following errorp  blockquote   pThe underlying connection was closed   Could not establish trust relationship   for the SSLTLS secure channel.

I just have to click continue to this website not recommended. I also have to select the installed client cert, which works fine. I can then download the WSDL and XSD files manually through IE. So another alternative might be to generate the WCF proxy from local copies of the WSDL and XSD, instead of running svcutil against the live service.

Negative 3 pIs there any way to detect when an NSView will be deallocedp  pThe reason is, I have some simple delegates such as an NSTextField delegate that handles controltextViewdoCommandBySelector to allow the returntab keys to be entered.  Id like to just stick this delegate object in the nib, wire up the NSTextFields delegate connection and have it work.p  pAnd it does work, but the delegate is never released even after the NSTextField it is linked to is released, so the delegate object leaks.p  pId like the delegate object to be able to detect when the NSTextField is dealloced, but I cant think of any way to do this, which leaves me having to store a separate link to the delegate object from some other controller and manually release it at some point which is very much less than ideal.

Negative 3 pI have a web project that is built with maven.  I have the project in eclipse as a WTP project generated using mvn eclipseeclipse, and it is associated with a glassfish server, also configured in eclipse.  I can publish to the server.

Negative 3 pI am using Entity Framework and Ive come to an interesting stumbling block. Lets say there is a db table Item with sequence column of type int and others of course. Column sequence must be unique and it is used for reordering of items.p  pEF maps this table to Item class with sequence int property. Now lets say I want to swap position of two items by mutually exchanging each others sequence number. Upon calling SaveChanges EF throws an exception complaining about sequence uniqueness.

This is a composite control, and firebug shows me that the value for the text box that simulates the combo still has the old value. Im suspecting onViewStateLoaded, but turning viewstate off for the Telerik didnt help any. II dont need it anyway, cuz I have to put the selected value in another hidden to make a cross page post on submit. Any ideas before I hack this up really bad Any will be appreciated.p

Negative 3 pstrongContextstrongp  pThis is a question mainly about Lucene or possibly Solr internals. The main topic is emfaceted searchem, in which search can happen along multiple independent dimensions facets of objects for example size, speed, price of a car.p  pWhen implemented with relational database, for a large number of facets multifield indices are not useful, since facets can be searched in any order, so a specific ordered multiindex is used with low chance, and creating all possible orderings of indices is unbearable.p  pSolr is advertised to cope well with the faceted search task, which if I think correctly has to be connected with Lucene supposedly performing well on multifield queries where fields of a document relate to facets of an object.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pThe stronginverted indexstrong of Lucene can be stored in a relational database, and naturally taking the intersections of the matching documents can also be trivially achieved with RDBMS using singlefield indices.p  pTherefore, Lucene supposedly has some advanced technique for multifield queries other than just taking the intersection of matching documents based on the inverted index.p  pSo the question is, what is this techniquetrick More broadly Why can LuceneSolr achieve better faceted search performance theoretically than RDBMS could if sop  pemNote My first guess would be that Lucene would use some space partitioning method for partitioning a vector space built from the document fields as dimensions, but as I understand Lucene is not purely vector space based.emp

Negative 3 pemApologies for the crosspost with androiddevelopers forum. Havent received any answers thereemp  pI have an interesting design challenge  p  pI have a frontendActivity and a backend written in native CC code. The backend is a complex object which partially controls the flow of application amp once started runs in its own thread. So I have a distributed control scenario.  p  pThe strongActivity needs to be able to send messages asynchronouslystrong to the backend which then takes certain actions. But the strongbackend also needs to be able to send messages asynchronouslystrong to the Activity, to which it responds by chnaging UI, firing methods etc.  p  pEssentially what I need is a twoway listener.  p  pSo backend sends a message to screen take picture, prompt user, get location, take another picture now etc and screen does what it needs to do. But in addition, the screen should also be able to call the backendlistener to send back messages captured camera image, system generated  I got pauseddestroyed message, etc in the callbacks of these events. Main problem is that this is all asynchronous.  p  pIs this possible without tightcoupling Is this even possible  p  pI have thought of Asynctaskhandlers but thats a one way street for informing the UI thread, observerpattern both objects will be observerobservable but confused on where to begin. Any thoughts, links would be very helpful.   p

Negative 3 pIn the past when I have needed to display large data sets in a table, Ive just looped over the data and on every iteration Id inflate an xml layout representing a TableRow, obtain references to the child controls, set their properties from the data source and add the row to a TableLayout.

Am I doing this correctly, or is there a way to use an adapter to display tabular data with column alignment like in a TableLayout  Or, is there some way to apply the ViewHolder pattern to the way Im manually adding rows to a TableLayout to avoid the extra calls to inflate xml and get references to child controls findViewByIdp

Negative 3 pI want to instrument the bytecode of some classes on the classpath at loading time. Since these are 3rd party libraries, I know exactly when they are loaded. The problem is that I need to do the instrumentation selectively, i.e. instrument only some classes.

Negative 3 pIm having one hell of a time trying to figure out why I cant get the codeLinkButtoncode to PostBack when I have an image with an codeImageMapcode associated with it.p  pLet me describe the system a little, so you can get a basic understanding of whats happening. The codeLinkButtoncode has codeonClickcode set to call codewindow.shoModalDialogcode, which obviously opens a modal window where the user can select various options an an ImageMap, save, and close the window. When the window closes, a PostBack is supposed to occur so that the main landing page gets updated with the new options selected.p  pTo add complexity, the link button needs to have an image that shows what points were selected in modal window the image is a smaller version of the previous window. So what Ive done is add an image map to the image in the LinkButton like sop  precodeltaspPanel IDpnlC2R1 runatservergt     ltaspLinkButton IDHyperLink1 runatservergt         ltimg IDSomeImage altSome image                runatserver srcImagesSomeImage.jpg usemapSomeMap gt      ltaspLinkButtongt ltaspPanelgt codepre  pThe map is a regular HTML map not the ASP.NET one, though Im sure its rendered the same, but I digress. Also, Im using a hrefhttpwww.outsharked.comimagemapster relnofollowImageMapstera to highlight the points that have been selected, but that doesnt cause any issues as far as I can tell.p  pIf I remove the codeusemapcode attribute, a PostBack occurs, if I add it back in, it doesnt. p  pIs the ImageMap overriding the events that are supposed to occur under normal conditions for the LinkButton Is there a way to make the ImageMap do a PostBack like the LinkButton would under normal circustances p  pI tried using the ASP.NET codeImageButtoncode control, but I couldnt figure out how to get the ImageMap on it, if thats even possible. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, and please let me know if I need to clarify anything, Im fairly certain half of what I wrote probably doesnt make sense. Dp  pstrongUPDATEstrong The issue had nothing to do with the codeImageMapcode itself. It had to do with the codeOnClientClickcode closing the modal dialog before the codeOnClickcode event could be called. p

How would I say, make the blueberries blue, bannanas yellow, etc. in the chartp  pI know this is a weird question, but I cant think of a simpler way to describe it.p  pI dont care if the solution is in XAML or code, just as long as it works.p

Negative 3 pI have access to an web service that returns an XML or JSON. Since web service calls are expensive, I want to store the XMLJSON in my database so that I can access the data faster. The question I have is if I should just store the entire XMLJSON in a field or should I design a database model that represents the XMLJSON in a normalized wayp  pIf I just needed to have the XMLJSON data available to me, then saving it as a string in a field would be OK.p  pHowever, I know that Ill be needed to extract only certain XMLJSON documents  so I kindda need to be able to query this. For simple queries, maybe I can use something like codeLIKE lttitlegthello worldlttitlegtcode if I was search for hello world between the title tags within an XML document. But I think some of my queries might go beyond string matching e.g. greater than a certain number or date, etc.. So I feel like I need to model this data properly in my database and populate it with the values from XMLJSON. This will become a painful exercise, though.p  pAny tips on what I should do Maybe there is an option I didnt consider.p

Actually those chceck boxes will be generated with jQuery templating so postback is not an option to enable disable validtion.p  pI would like to know whether there is any way we can enable disable the .CausesValidation property for the controls from browser using some setting Or is there a way to capture the controls which are to be considered for validation slectively in some event before pageloadp  p[Update] Based on Accepted answer, here is my solutionp  precodeltform idform1 runatservergt ltdivgt     ltaspTextBox IDtextbox1 runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt     ltaspRequiredFieldValidator IDreq1 ControlToValidatetextbox1 runatserver         ErrorMessageenter textgtltaspRequiredFieldValidatorgt     ltaspTextBox IDtextbox2 runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt     ltaspRequiredFieldValidator IDreq2 ControlToValidatetextbox2 runatserver         ErrorMessageenter text for 2gtltaspRequiredFieldValidatorgt     ltaspCheckBox IDcheck1 runatserver Textchoose gt     ltaspButton IDsubmitBtn runatserver OnClicksubmitBtnClick Textsubmit gt     ltaspCustomValidator IDcvBox runatserver ErrorMessageError ValidationGroupprueba         OnServerValidateValidarcajagtltaspCustomValidatorgt     ltaspValidationSummary IDsummary runatserver gt ltdivgt ltformgt    protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      req1.Enabled  false     req2.Enabled  false  protected void submitBtnClickobject sender, EventArgs e      if Page.IsPostBack              Page.Validate         if Page.IsValid                      Response.Writevalid form                  else                      Response.Writeinvalid form                protected void Validarcajaobject source, ServerValidateEventArgs args      if check1.Checked              req1.Enabled  true         req1.Validate        codepre

Negative 3 pits better to call this problem as  puzzle. Problem is br I allocating a number of batch to a Third Party. At time of Registration That party telling me how many batch it Wants . now third party can allocate that batchs to its operators. at any order.How can i allocate unique string to every operator.. i know its confusing then lets have a example.p  pA do the Registration and ask For 15 Batchs.I give him 15 Batch Limit.at allocation time  i allocating Batchs Like A1,A2...till A15Limit of that User.brSO i bind That With Drop Down List.So user Can Select a Single Record From There. NOw what User Did .he Select A1 for one Batch and for next Batch He Selects A10.So these batch must not be shown in DDl. Next time i need to Show only those batch which is not allocated within Limit.p  pTo get the Difference i written a query like thisp  precodeSelect NumOfDataEntryOper        select isnullCOUNT[BatchID],0 as Avaiable Allocation from TBLiBATCH        where iRegFormID  iRegFormID and  [isBatchClosed]0 Or [Cancelled]1   From TBLiREGFORM      Where           iRegFormIDiRegFormID           And          MailIDMailid codepre  pThis will give me remaing Batch Count.But how to do the Allocationp

Negative 3 pShort story A ListBox inside a focus scope doesnt allow an item to be selected.p  pLong storyp  pI am trying to make a contextsensitive widget for data entry. I have the main panel with several fields. Below that, I have a panel with codeFocusManager.FocusScopeTruecode.

I put a ListBox into the focus scope, but I cant select any items. When something is selected programmatically and you click on the ListBox, it deselects everything.p  pI tested a few events, and it isnt picking up MouseDown events, but it is picking up MouseMove events. It fires GotFocus whenever I click on an item, but it never fires LostFocus.

Negative 3 pIve always been told vectors are fast, and in my years of programming experience, Ive never seen anything to contract that.  I decided to prematurely optimize and write a associative class that was a thin wrapper around a sequential container namely codestdvectorcode and provided the same interface as codestdmapcode.  Most of the code was really easy, and I got it working with little difficulty.  p  pHowever, in my tests of various sized POD types 4 to 64 bytes, and codestdstringscode, with counts varying from eight to twothousand, codestdmapfindcode was faster than my codeassociativefindcode, usually around 15 faster, for almost all tests.  I made a a hrefhttphomepage1.nifty.comalgafieldsscce.htmlShort, Self Contained, Correct Compilable, Examplea that clearly shows this a hrefhttpideone.com41iKtat ideonea  I checked MSVC9s implementation of codestdmapfindcode and confirmed that it matches my codevecfindcode and codestdlowerboundcode code quite closely, and cannot account for why the codestdmapfindcode runs faster, except for a discussion on Stack Overflow where people speculated that the binary search method does not benefit at all from the locality of the vector until the last comparison making it no faster, and that its requires pointer arithmetic that codestdmapcode nodes dont require, making it slower.  p  pToday someone challenged me on this, and provided a hrefhttpideone.comvaI3vthis code at ideonea, which when I tested, showed the vector to be over twice as fast.  p  pDo the coders of StackOverflow want to enlighten me on this apparent discrepancy    Ive gone over both sets of code, and they seem euqivalent to me, but maybe Im blind from playing with both of them so much.p  pFootnote this is emvery closeem to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8784732one of my previous questionsa, but my code had several bugs which were addressed.  Due to new informationcode, I felt this was different enough to justify a separate question.  If not, Ill work on merging them.p

Note that not every year has measurments for the doc and some depth classes are missing.  This is annoying but comes up often in my data set.

Negative 3 pIm trying to animate a field of grass growing by sprouting the same small sprite 500 times. The effect Im trying to acheive is each individual clump of grass would grow in this case scaleY and the field would be full over the course of 3 seconds. Im using a CCSpriteBatchNode, which Im now reading is not an efficient way to go with just one sprite file. Heres my code which gives me the desired effect, but I cant get the speed that I want.p  precode    GRASS batchNode     CCSpriteBatchNode grassBatch1  [CCSpriteBatchNode batchNodeWithFilegrass1.png capacity500]     grassBatch1.position  CGPointMake0, 10     [self addChildgrassBatch1 z1 tag201]     for int x0 xlt500 x               CCSprite s  [CCSprite spriteWithBatchNodegrassBatch1 rectCGRectMake0, 0, 32, 32]         [s setOpacity255]         [grassBatch1 addChilds]         [s setPositionccparc4random10240, arc4random750]         [s setScaleY0]         [s setAnchorPointCGPointMake0, 0]         CCScaleTo grassScale  [CCScaleTo actionWithDuration0.4 scale1]         CCEaseElasticOut grassBounce  [CCEaseElasticOut actionWithActiongrassScale period0.2f]         CCDelayTime grassDelay  [CCDelayTime actionWithDurationrandom500]         [s runAction[CCSequence actionsgrassDelay,grassBounce, nil]]      codepre  pIn CCDelayTime, the 500 number causes each clump to animate in individually, but it does 1 clump per second. If I make that number 10, then it combines the 500 clumps into groups of 10 and animates each group 1 per second. I want each clump or group of clumps to animate 1 after another evenly timed over the course of 3 seconds. A plus on top of this would be to animate in a direction, like a wave effect, so the grass starts growing from left to right or bottom to top. p  pIs there a better approach to producing 500 individually growing sprites that use the same .png file p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOK, so I guess I needed a better understanding of the use of random and the integer that follows. I get that 500 in the duration part would indeed push the animation to 500 seconds. I wanted to use less than 1, and values with decimals 0.6 for example were being denied. Fractions apparently work. In order to get something close to what Im working towards I made the following adjustments to the code above.p  pFirst I added a random to the scale actionp  precodeCCScaleTo grassScale  [CCScaleTo actionWithDurationrandom7 scale1] codepre  pand then used a fraction on the delayp  precodeCCDelayTime grassDelay  [CCDelayTime actionWithDurationrandom120] codepre  pI know that going this route to acheive the effect that I want is pretty taxing on the device to manage. On an iPad2, my frame rate drops from 60 to 48 then goes back to 60 fairly quickly, but the CPU usage increases from 20 or so to 85. The main visual drawback is the delay in transitioning from the prior scene to this one. Lesser devices will undoubtedly experience more delay and drops in frame rate.p  pI know this probably isnt the right way to approach this animation. And, Id still like to do a rolling, or wave type animation on this so it travels over a direction. Does anyone have any thoughts on this effectp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThis is the code attempted from andrewxs suggestionp  precode    for int i  0 i lt 500 i               CCSprite grassClump  [CCSprite spriteWithFilegrass1.png]         grassClump.anchorPoint  CGPointMake0.5, 0         grassClump.position  ccparc4random10240, arc4random1800         grassClump.scaleY  0         CCScaleTo grassScale  [CCScaleTo actionWithDurationrandom7 scale1]         CCEaseElasticOut easeGrassScale  [CCEaseElasticOut actionWithActiongrassScale period0.3f]         CCDelayTime grassDelay  [CCDelayTime actionWithDurationrandom5]         [self addChildgrassClump z5]         [grassClump runAction[CCSequence actionsgrassDelay, easeGrassScale, nil]]      codepre  pIt acts identically to my previous code, but avoids the sprite batch node, which is probably a good thing. I havent tested performance to see if this is an improvement or not yet.p

Negative 3 pIll preface this with Im really new to working on Android.p  pSo I have to work on an existing app and create a screen that prompts the user for a username if one isnt entered then it wont launch the currently existing main activity i.e. it wont fully launch the app. Instead it will just sit on that screen until a username is entered.p  pI suppose that its tantamount to a web app login page in that it will not let a user past that page if the user is not authenticated and authorized. However, theres no authentication nor authorization in this app. Instead, on first run a user must simply register with a username and that username gets saved to the database and, for any subsequent runs, the apps main activity will simply start because a user has already registered to that phone. In fact, the app will not prompt the user for their name again unless the app gets deleted with all its data and reinstalled again. p  pThis implicitly means that I have to save the users name in the database or some other kind of storage. p  pSo I was wondering what would be the best way of doing this in an app with an existing main activityp  pShould I try to accomplish this on that existing main activity or create a new activity to display this prompt screen and, in effect, block the main activity from running until the user enters their namep  pAny tutorials or links would be helpful and thank you in advance for any help.p

Negative 3 phere is my Java problemp  pMy Circle class implements the Shape interface and thus it must implement all the methods required.

Negative 3 pMy requirement is load 100 thumbnails under 2 seconds in my Asp.Net Web Application. Actual size of each images are approx.800 KB. So I used a web handler method to resize the image on the flyHere image size reduced to 8KB. Here I found 96 requests are sent to the server and thumbnails are loaded under 4 seconds. I found 90 of the time is losing in strongemblockingemstrong inspected in Firebug net tab. So I moved from 96 request to a single request. Thus web handler accept a single request and creates 96 thumbnail images and combine 96 thumbnails into a big single image and write this single image to the output stream.This case I found about 6 seconds was taken for loading the single image. Then I used a .Net Thread Pool mechanism for creating the thumbnails in the web handler.Thus load time reduced to 2.6 seconds.I found that only 1 second or below time is actually taken for the server processing.Remaining 1.6 seconds is losing.

Negative 3 pIve Googled this and read many posts, but there are so many different answers that all make logical sense that I was wondering if an expert on the topic could demystify this question.p  pSome say that there is no return because there is no way to return  the syntax prohibits it  yes, this makes sense, but I believe that all functions have to return something, no Others say that the constructor sort of returns the newly created object itself, which seems to make sense since the assignment operator is used on the constructor. Still others have other interesting explanations.p

Negative 3 pI am trying to implement a remember me system with cookies that will remember a user across browsers meaning that if a user logs into a website using browser A and checks remember me, and then logs into browser B using remember me, he will continue to be automatically logged in regardless of which browser he uses. checking remember me in browser B will not break his persistent login in browser A.  p  pTo do this, I set up my database so that multiple keys can be stored alongside a user id.  When a user logs onto my website, the cookies value is checked.  If that value is found in the database, the user is assigned a new cookie and that cookie key entry in the database is updated to match.  Other keys are left alone so that other browsers login persistence will not be affected.  When a user logs out manually, the cookie is checked, the corresponding entry in the database is deleted, and then the cookie is deleted.p  pThe problem comes up when a user manually deletes his cookie.  If the user does this, I have no way of deleting the corresponding entry in the database.  It will simply become a permanent entry in my database.  This was not a problem when I was not trying to support crossbrowser remember me, but has become a problem by allowing multiple cookie keys to be stored.p  pIs there any way that I can fix  avoid thisp  pThere is a ton of information out there on persistent logins, but persistent logins across browsers never seems to be covered, so any help would be great.  Also feel free to critique my approach and any security issues.  It seemed way more secure when I was only allowing one remember me per user, but persistent log ins across browsers seems like functionality that users would want.p  pI am using MySQL and PHP.p

Negative 3 pI had developed an album app in which I am using grid View. The app is working but every time when I press back button and return to my app, one more copy of image is appearing in  the grid view. For instance, I have 7 images in the grid view, when I press back button and then return to app, it becomes 14. Next time total images will be 21 and so on. I am reading images from SD card. My app is having full screen functionality, so same thing occurs that case as well. I am not getting why it happened.

Negative 3 pI wrote a serverside application that powers a website and multiple mobile clients. I used Hibernate for data access. I later discovered that the app fails after a day When I checked around online, I found out that its a well know issue with MySQL terminating a stale connection after 8 hours. In order to avoid this, I found many suggestions like including codeautoReconnecttruecode, using codec3P0code, etc. Since codeautoReconnectcode is officially discouraged especially in production environment and also because it didnt have any effect when I applied it, I decided to go for codec3p0code. Unfortunately, after introducing the codec3p0code configuration in my codehibernate.cfg.xmlcode file, the application starts throwing a codeNullPointerExceptioncode somewhere in my code where I called codedbSession.closecode This means that the codeHibernateUtil.getSessionFactorycode actually returns codenullcode. I have added the required jars c3p00.9.2pre2.jar, hibernatecore3.3.1.GA.jar, hibernatec3p03.3.2.GA.jar, mchangecommonsjava0.2.1.jar and c3p0oraclethinextras0.9.2pre2.jar even though I dont think its all of them that are required. Ive gone through many of the pages that talked about this issue but Im still not able to set it up properly. Kindly help me with a beginnerfriendly easytoimplement, stepbystep procedure for setting up codec3p0code with Hibernate.

logs. codepre  pMost of my Hibernate configuration files where generated by Netbeans. I had the database on ground then I used the Hibernate wizards in Netbeans to generate the configuration files, entity classes and mapping files from it. These were working correctly before I introduced c3p0 but they fail after 8 hours. I use Mecurial with my project and reverting the whole project back to a time prior to when I introduced c3p0, it works again for 8 hours. Even handdeleting all the c3p0 configurations in hibernate.cfg.xml makes the app work again. emWhat could I be doing wrongemp

Negative 3 pIf one were to issue a sequential series of writes in LinuxUnix seperated by codefdatasync2code or codefsync2code or codesync2code is it guaranteed that the first write will be committed to disk before your second write. The following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5132343howdoesbehavelinuxbuffercachewhenanapplicationiscrashingdownSO posta seems to say that such guarantees cannot be given, since there are multiple caching layers involved. For db systems which guarantee consistency this seems to be important, since in WALWrite ahead logging recovery, youd need your logs to be persisted on disk before actually changing your data, so that in the event of an applicationsystem failure you can revert back to your last known consistent state. How is this ensuredimplemented in an actual database systemp

Negative 3 pTrying to teach myself EF Code First, and have got the initial database creation setup extended the way I want it for now and the initial creation of a database going, but trying to figure out how best to handle and manage future updates a database and still work with creating new databases.p  pIve come up with a scenario that I havent found any good examples or suggestions for online.  I want an application that the user can create a new database, which creates a new database based on the existing model based on the POCO objects in the code at that time.  As I said, that works fine for me so far.  A bit later, a program update comes along, and via the migrations objects in the assembly, it knows what to do and updates the database using the EF Code First migrations using the DbMigrator.Update method.  So far good to go, at least for the initial version of the program.p  pNow, later on down the line, in a newer version, they want to create a new database for whatever reason.  So they do based on the current model in the code at that time, and that works fine.  However, there are these other migrations from before that point in the assembly that dont need to be run at all since the model already has any changes that might be needed setup and ready to go, but the newly created migrations table doesnt know that they dont, at least as far as I can tell.  I dont want them run, but I want any future updates to be applied to any database that needs them later on.p  pMy thought, from what Ive read so far, is I need to create additional logic to track what the latest DB migration is in the code using some kind of timestamp property for the various migrations to determine the order upon creation and somehow tell it not to actually do any migration updates that are there before that dateversion, but the EF migration logic will still update the MigrationHistory table with the info that tells it that that particular migration has been run.  Im thinking that Ill do this manually via reflection to get the migration objects and running them in order by specifying the migration object name into the update method, but have some check to prevent actually running the database changes during initialization.  Then when any new ones pop up later on after a code update, the older migrations wont run since they are already in the MigrationHistory table, but the DbMigrator.Update method will still run any newer migrations missing from the table.p  pBefore I spent a lot of time figuring that logic out I wanted to make sure there wasnt something in the documentation or coming down the pipe that I was completely overlooking or missed that handled this better already built in andor get some input on the best way to handle this case.  It seems like a fairly common scenario in my opinion, but I dont see a good way of handling it with the base EF logic.p

Negative 3 pIm writing a website using Rails 3.2.6 and it needs to be able to display maths formatting on the website. To do this job I am using the mathjaxrails gem which works perfectly rendering the maths on, for example, questions1. However, I would like the user to be able to download the question containing the maths content as a PDF. I have done a lot of searching and fiddling with my app and the closest I have come to a solution is wkhtmltopdf and the wickedpdf gem. This works, in that a PDF is created which is saved to the users computer. However, the maths is not rendered properly because, I presume, mathjax is not actually processing it.p  pHaving done a bit of reading, I thought I found the answer elsewhere where it said to add a delay to the controller to give mathjax a chance to do its magicp  precodeformat.pdf do     render pdf gt filename,           javascriptdelaygt5000   end codepre  pHowever this doesnt work either and I end up with a PDF covered in things likep  p[itex]3H2g  2N2g  NH3g[itex]p  pRather than formatted maths.

Negative 3 pI have an accordion that has another accordion inside one of its panes. This inner accordion is created using a datasource so each of its panes are loaded from a list of objects. In this particular case, this datasource is also loaded on demand. Now, where Im stuck is that I want to be able to load the pane headers only and then load the contents when the pane is clicked similar to what I have in the outer pane. The reason Im confused here, is because the lazy load happens when the pane is clicked, but since this happens AFTER the databind, I dont know how to reference the content of the pane that invokes the ItemCommand. Not sure if that makes sense.

The listview contained in the LayoutTemplate will not have its datasource bound until the LinkButton has been clicked, which will fire the item command. Also worth noting that this entire accordion is wrapped in an UpdatePanel.p  pThis is the code behind I was starting to work with, but it doesnt appear to get the correct instance of the listview and while the list is not empty, it will not display anythingp  precode    protected void accReviewersItemCommandobject sender, CommandEventArgs e              var mocId  int.Parsee.CommandArgument.ToString         var list  sender as AjaxControlToolkit.Accordion.FindControllvReviewers as ListView APPARENTLY WRONG         var reviewers  MocApi.GetReviewsmocId          list.DataSource  reviewers         list.DataBind      codepre  pSo to recap, when the LinkButton within the HeaderTemplate is clicked, I need to somehow gain reference to the correct instance of the ListView so that I can bind its datasource.

Negative 3 pI have a UITableView with cells in it, and there are buttons to the right of the Table View, so that when I click one of the buttons it takes the selected TableViewCells label text, and saves it to the array specific to the button that was clicked.  The buttons have different colored text, Green, Blue, Red, Purple, and Orange.  What I want to happen, is when I click one of the buttons it will put a colored circle to the right of the text in the cell.  The color of the circle will depend on what button was pressed.  I feel like you could do something with the accessory view of the cell, but what gets tricky, is when you click another button for that same cell it will put another colored circle in.  I want to be able to show 5 circles if needed and if you click the same button again it will take away the circle you previously added.  Here is a picture of my app with some photoshoped circles to give you an idea. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJK1eb.png altenter image description herep  pDoes anyone have any ideas or approaches to this problem.

I would much prefer the first approach. A view model should not exhibit singleton characteristics.p

Negative 3 pIm creating a game with Scala and I would like to know how to do neatly the network part. My game is a strategic game which is composed by orders that are case class.p  pBy exemple codeMovefromInt,Int, toInt,Int extends Ordercode. p  pWhen in a multiplayer game, the android client should receive an order with an id containing the id from the player that made that move and send his own moves. I want to use a central server to each every client connect. So basically, a client should be able to log on the server, to send enough information to create a game on the server, to ask the list of the game, and to join a new game, but also to receive serialized data from the server, and case class. p  pI saw that codefinaglecode was a good option, my problem is I have some trouble with finagle on Android and it can only receive data after asking for them, so i have to do a Refresh packet every x to keep the client updated.p

Negative 3 pI have a VS2010 web project that I debug with iisexpress.p  pSometimes when stepping code I notice something wrong that would have undesirable effects, e.g. in my 70 Gigabyte database, so I want to stop the code.p  pMy reflex action is to stop debugging in VS2010, but this has the effect that the debugger detaches from the process, and that causes the code to continue running at full speed and do that thing I wanted to avoid.p  pSo, is there any way to get the site to stop instead of continue running at full speed, when I stop debugging in VSp  pNote I dont lose any data or anything  its safe test data. But due to the large database size, restoring a new test database is a big waste of time.p  pNote 2 I know I can stop iisexpress in various ways instead of stoppping the debugger in VS. The problem is that I keep forgetting this, and remember only after the damage is done.p  pSo, please, no suggestions that tell med how to stop iisexpress manually or how to protect my database. Only try to answer the actual question how to AUTOMATICALLY stop the site from executing when I hit stop debugging inside VS. Thats it.p

However, because many of the pages the user will be using have updatepanels and update asynchronously, the function I am using is being reached, but being skipped over according to the debugger.p  pThe function I am using isp  precodeScriptManager.RegisterStartupScriptmain, this.GetType, callTimer, callTimer, true codepre  pThis function runs fine on a regular postbacks, or asynchronous postbacks on the masterpage I update the timer by doing a postback on a updatepanel in the masterpage, however, will be skipped on asynchronous postbacks.p  pI have tried a few things, making the control of the function Page or the UpdatePanel in the masterpage or the updatepanel in the childpages. I have tried putting this code in the childpages as well, but while these change do reset the timer, it causes the javascriptcode to run multiple times and they fight over the label displaying the countdown.p  pIm really at a loss here. I think a possible solution would be to change the startupscripts control and terminate all javascripts running before that code again. However searching for a way to terminate, cancel or stop javascript functions programatically yields no useful results as well.p  pAnother solution I would be okay with is reseting the timer on mouse movement, but since Im designing for IE8, this will not work unless the window is out of focus.p
Negative 3 pI have python project that runs on multiple machines. I am using virtualenv to sync the python modules across the multiple machines. This works great. However I am pulling in some inhouse baked SWIG .sos packages into the env as well. These c shared objects have some farreaching dependency nightmares which are difficult to reproduce on some of the machines. I dont need there codefunctionality on a few of the devel machines.

Negative 3 pIm a Django newbie doing a primitive website. I installed haystack and Whoosh as its search engine cause it was the simplest thing to do. It works fine, but there is a problem and I dont know how to Google it. I have some categories on my site and I have indexed their names to search. So, when a user enters Computing it finds the computing category and links to it. But there is a problem. If a user enters Comp into search field, it doesnt find Computing at all. Is this something that can be configured and how p  pEDITp  pWhat else have I tried Installing haystack 2.0, following a hrefhttpwww.alexanderinteractive.comblog201208gettingstartedwithsolranddjango relnofollowthisa tutorial, installing solr instead of whoosh, trying Ngram fields, rebuilding indexes 10 times, rewriting searchindexes.py. Everything. Doesnt work. If I type in Comp, it doesnt find Computing. Is there anything else I could do I have noticed that in the tutorial above, everything works like a charm instantly.p

Any ideasp  pEDIT 1 If I add a codectx.SaveChangescode after the codectx.AddToPropertyTypespropTypecode and step the actual adding appears to happen only once SaveChanges execute. This however does not suit my requirements as I want to first validate objects prior to saving and wanted to iterate through the entities in the entity set.

Negative 3 pA few time ago I developed a win for app based on primary start app, meaning its an application which able to load user profile and other stuff, such as username, surname, mail address, granted actions, printinganabled, saveingenabled and so on. Then, my coworker are free to develop any other application as DLL which are loaded via reflection by my primary application where its able to load any form as mdi child. Thats all. Finally, every primary app command being realying on child form which implements some interface so all works perfectly.p  pWell, now I need to convert the above logic on new web site solution. Think of that where my primary startup app could be thought as master page. Here, I can load info user user profile and other stuff such as application enabled he is, printing pageenabled, data storingenabled and so on. By the way, my coworker should be able to develop other sub web site reached by my primary startup master page. Also, both of them should comunicate in order to realy some command, for instance user click on masterpage save button, then storing db action will relay to content page just as win form solution.p  pI dont know which can be better solution fort this purpose, I hope to be clear to explain my scenario.p

Negative 3 pI am using the jQuery version of the Fineuploader script ver 3.3.p  pI have created the necessary upload script and all appears to be working as expected, but my goal here is to upload multiple files to a single folder which is dynamically created based on the database entry ID which gets created when the first file uploads. To do this, I have set up the folderdb entry ID as a return paramater with the JSON info I return at the end of my script and then, using the oncomplete... function, I am attempting to set that parameter to pass back to my PHP script in order to prevent my PHP script from creating a new DB entry, thus creating a new folder for each file.p  pOn logging the results in my JS console I see that this is not working because it appears my use of oncomplete... only sets the parameter after the last file is finished uploading.

Negative 3 pSHORT VERSIONp  pI have a List object that contains a number of duplicate values doubles that exist in runs of duplicate values interspersed with runs of changing values.  I want to reduce the space in memory that this List object takes up WITHOUT compromising the association between the indices and the values.  I would also like to maintain as close to O1 algorithmic lookup time as possible, using the index as the lookup.  For example, if you have a list with elements 0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, then the new objectentity would always return 0.1 if given the index 1,2, or 3.  I would expect I would need to create my own object perhaps implementing IList, or use an existing object out there.  I have an idea on how to implement this that would make the algorithm Ologm, where, m is the number of runs of identical values in my example, there would only be 1 run.  However, I would rather not roll my own if possible.p  pstrongDoes such an object exist for C, or do I need to roll my ownstrongp  pMOTIVATIONLONG VERSIONp  pI have a desktop application that is doing some heavy scientific calculations.  The calculations generate a large amount of data, and that data is organized based on time.  That is, for time 50, there is a value of variable x, y, and z.  For time 51, there is another value of variable x, y, and z.  I have a List that contains all the times that the calculation was run at.  Each variable has a List, whose indexes are the same as those for the times List.  That is, if you look at the index 234 of the time array, you might get the time 46 seconds.  The calculation of each variable at time 46 seconds would be then found at index 234 of the List for that variable.p  pThere are around 100,000 such variables and thus 100,000 Lists, but only one time List. I also expect to add many more variables. This is obviously a bit of a memory issue. at least around 200 MB of raw space at present time  .  This should also explain why I want to use the index as the method of finding the value of a certain variable at a certain time.p  pIt is fairly typical for a variable to have only 0s in the first x number of slots.  Or after index y, the variable holds constant until the end.  I would say that a worst case for the number of periods where the values are constant might be around 30 in a single list, but more typically between 2 and 5.  The number of total values in each array might be typically around 250.  p  pEDITp  pNote that I am expecting to add even more variables than the 100,000, so this is bigger issue than just 200 MB.  To explain more of the motivation for this, my app was running at around 1 GB at present, and I saw the 200 MB as the lowhanging fruit for reduction of memory usage.p  pEDIT2p  pI realized a very important edit to my explanation I have editted it above and also explain it here.  The Lists may have runs in them, but they also have sections where the values are changing from index to index.  So a better example of a list I might have is the followingp  p0 0 0 0 0 0 ....50 duplicate 0s ...0.1 0.2 0.4 0.5 0.6 ... 50 more changing values ... 200.45 200.45 200.45 200.55 ... 50 more duplicate values .... etc.p

Negative 3 pWHAT I WANT IS A GUI TO COME UP IF THE GPS IS OFFLINE SO USER CAN INPUT CURRENT ADDRESS.p  pI am building a Android App in Eclipse with Google Maps.  One of my Activities brings up a mapview when opened.  What I would like to do is if the GPS is not on instead of loading the map I would like the activity to show a EditText Text view where the user can enter a address for their current location, then the map view would show up after entering this address.  I have all of the Logic to get the GPS Boolean to show if the GPS is on but what I would really need is the Activity.java and layout xml logic that would show either of these GUI items based on the GPS Being on.  So if GPS is on the mapview will show, if the GPS is not on the activity would show a area to enter the address and a button, and once the button is clicked this logic will bring up the location on the mapview that the user entered.p  pActivity.java filep  precode SuppressLintShowToast       public class MapViewActivity extends FragmentActivity              static LatLng currentLatLng

Im also setting MALLOCCHECK0 for this testing.p  pMy goal of this toy example is to simply see if I can write 4 bytes to some arbitrary address I specify. The most simple test I can think of is to try write something to 0x41414141, which is an illegal address and should let the program crash to just confirm to me that it is indeed trying to write to this address something I should be able to observe in GDB.p  pSo I try executing with the argument codeperl e print Ax128 . xf8xffxffxff . xf8xffxffxff . x41x41x41x41 . x41x41x41x41 codep  pSo I havep  precodeBuffer A 128 bytes of 0x41. prevsize 0xfffffff8 size 0xfffffff8 FD 0x41414141 BK 0x41414141 codepre  pIm using 0xfffffff8 instead of 0xfffffffc because there is a note that with glibc 2.3 the third lowest bit NONMAINAREA is used for management purposes for the arenas and has to be 0.p  pThis should attempt to write 0x41414141 to 0x41414141  12 to be more correct, but still an illegal address, correct However, when I execute this, the program simply terminates normally.p  pWhat am I missing here This seems simple enough that it shouldnt be that hard to get to work.p  pIve tried various things such as using 0xfffffffc instead for prevsize and size, using legal addresses for FD some address on the heap. Ive tried swapping the order A and B are freed, Ive tried to step into free to see what happens in GDB but I got lost. Note that there shouldnt be any other security features on this system as it is very old and wouldnt have NXbit, ASLR, etc not that it should matter for the purpose of just writing 4 bytes to an illegal address.p  pAny ideas for how to make this workp  pI could add that if using MALLOCCHECK3 I get thisp  precodemalloc using debugging hooks malloc using debugging hooks free invalid pointer 0x8049688  Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted. 0x4004a1b1 in kill  from liblibc.so.6 codepre

Negative 3 pmy website has several audio players on one page. Mostly these audio players would depend on an html5 codeltaudiogtcode element, however for some sites there is an flash  codeltobjectgtcode fallback. I was thinking to include volume controls for each player, but than thought That I can use one Universal volume control for all of them as there can be only one player playing at a time I tried researching this topic, but could not find any useful information. Therefore I decided to ask the community, is there a way to, no matter if it is codeltaudiogtcode or flash fallback, to control volume of the whole website Maybe jQuery solution, some html5 magic Or what needs to be done in order for this to workp  pPlayers are based on this plugin a hrefhttpkolber.github.ioaudiojsdocs relnofollowhttpkolber.github.ioaudiojsdocsap  pEDIT Something very similar to sound cloud, they have volume control in the header, which controls all players.p

Negative 3 pI have a number of bootstrap modals that contain very small forms 2 fields max. Because they are very similar in what they do, they all use a jQuery plugin I wrote to do the saving of the forms they contain the plugin does other things before saving as well, but thats irrelevant. p  pThese modals are embedded in multiple places. I want to have an easy way to determine, from other parts of the code, whether a saving occurred. Because the saving is abstracted from the code that would be interested in knowing when it occurs, I was thinking of changing the saving plugin to trigger custom events bound to document and then writing event handlers like document.onmyeventhere... whenever Im interested to know whether a saving occurred.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp

It works actually it writes a 1 for checked into my database BUT it writes a NULL instead of a 0 for false into my database for unchecked. I tried to change the FalseValue amp TrueValue property to FALSE and TRUE or 0 and 1 but it doesnt help. I also changed the field property NULLS ALLOWED to NULLS NOT ALLOWED but that didnt help as well. Since i need a 0 for not checked i need your help to accomplish that. p

Negative 3 pI am trying to determine which of these two to buy for my work. I have used SIMULINK but not LabVIEW. Is there anyone who has used both and would like to provide some details My investigation criteria are the user friendliness, availability of libraries and template functions, realtime probing facility, COTS hardware interfacing opportunity, quality of code generation, design for testability i.e. ease of generating unitacceptance tests, etc. However, if anyone would like to educate me with more criteria, please do so by all meansp  pFor anyone who does not know about SIMULINK and LabVIEW  These are both DomainSpecific Languages DSLs intended for graphical dataflow modelling and also code generation. These are multiindustrial tools and quite heavily used for engineering design and modelling.p  pstrongIMPORTANTstrong  I am quite interested to know if SIMULINK and LabVIEW offer realtime probing. For example, I have a model that I want to simulate. If there are variables associated to certain building blocks in that model, could I view them changing as the simulation continues I know that it is certainly not possible with SIMULINK as it has a stepbystep debugger. I am not aware of anything similar in LabVIEW.p  pI really have not used LabVIEW and cannot obtain it temporarily as my work internet has got download restrictions and administrative privilege issues. This is the reason why I simply cannot use only NI website to draw conclusions. If there is any white paper available that addresses this issue, I would also love to know p  pstrongUPDATE SINCE LAST POSTstrongp  pI have used MATLAB code generator and will not say that it is the best. However, I hear now that SIMULINK Embedded Coder is the best code generator and almost one of its own kind. Can anyone confirm whether or not this is good for safety critical system design i.e. generating code from safetycritical subsystem models. I know that the Mathworks is constantly trying to close the gap to achieve fullyflexible productionlevel CC code generation. p  pI know that an ideal answer would be,Depending on what you are trying to do, use a bit of both. And interestingly, I think I am heading to that direction. ATEOTD, it is a lot of money and need to be spent nicely.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 3 pI have a requirement, where I should be able to merge any 2 XML files having similar content though. Basically, my project has quite a few of XML files, which contain a lot of configuration information for different parts of the project. Also, it is possible that the clients for this project might have added some more information into the XMLs as part of their customization.  The problem now is that when i need to deliver a bug fix, or an enhancement, I might accidentally overwrite the customization done by the clients, which is definitely not acceptable. So, now, i need to create a utility which can help me with merging the XML files, while retaining the client customizations, and adding only the portion which has been added from the factory. I am not able to figure out how to achieve this. Any help in this regards would be appreciated.p

Negative 3 h2My Problemh2  pIm writing a PowerShell script that will need to download several large files from a remote web server before carrying on with other tasks. One of my project requirements is to show the progress of each download so the enduser knows whats going on.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4927295588006A response to another SO question contained a solution which uses registered events and Net.WebClient.DownloadFileAsynca. However, when I try the solution in the accepted answer, the download is completing long before my script has handled all of the DownloadProgressChanged events.p  h2What Ive Triedh2  pIve created a test script which Ive provided below in order to reproduce the problem and attempt to isolate where its occurring. At first I thought the problem was with the WriteProgress cmdlet being slow, so I replaced it with WriteHost to show the percentage completed. This produced many repeated lines with the same percentage value. Thinking that WriteHost might also be slow, I changed the event handlers action to only output the percentage when it changed. This didnt make a difference.p  pI noticed in the output that the download was completing before the event handler indicated that it was more than a few percent complete. There was a large delay during the first few percent, then it sped up. But the output of percentage complete was still slow even after the download completed. I made another modification to the script to show the time elapsed at each percentage change.p  pMy environment is Windows 7 and Server 2008 using PowerShell 2.0. Ive tried the script on both OSs with the same results. Im not using a PS profile and the Server 2008 computer is a fresh install.p  pHere is my test script.p  precode based on httpstackoverflow.coma4927295588006 client  NewObject System.Net.WebClient url[uri]httpswww.kernel.orgpublinuxkernelv2.6linux2.6.18.tar.bz2 fileenvUSERPROFILEDownloadslinux2.6.18.tar.bz2  try      RegisterObjectEvent client DownloadProgressChanged action               if  eventargs.ProgressPercentage gt percent               percent  eventargs.ProgressPercentage             if  starttime eq null                   starttime  getdate                           Get the elapsed time since we displayed the last percentage change             elapsedtime  newtimespan starttime getdate             writehost Percent complete eventargs.ProgressPercentage elapsedtime                    RegisterObjectEvent client DownloadFileCompleted SourceIdentifier Finished      client.DownloadFileAsyncurl, file       optionally wait, but you can break out and it will still write progress     WaitEvent SourceIdentifier Finished   finally      writehost File download completed     client.dispose     UnregisterEvent SourceIdentifier Finished     RemoveEvent SourceIdentifier Finished  codepre  pThe script produces the following output.p  precodePS CUsersdevtestDesktopgt .writeprogressspeed.ps1  Id              Name            State      HasMoreData     Location             Command                                                    1               7989b3fecce...

Negative 3 pThis is a best design question. I know there is many ways to do that. The question is, which is favourable for which reasons.p  pGenerally speaking I have a bunch of classes that contain data in different types. Each class is a little bit different from the others. At some point I might want to output the data contained in these classes, each class instance at a different point in time. I see two ways of implementing thisp  pa write a output method of some sort for each of the classes. When I wnat to output, I must rely on this method to exist. p  pb write a class OutputClasses which has a method output which handles the output differently for each classp  pWhich one would be the standard or expected way One of the above or something elsep

Negative 3 pI find that Run Configurations has a powerful button on the Plugins tab. Its the Add Required Plugins button. When I deselect all, and then tick on my plugins on Workspace, and click this button, it helps me to include a good dependencies minimum, required plugins list, ready to run validate successfully.p  pNow I have a product, featurebased. I already add my plugins to that feature. But its not able to run missing constraint, etc. How can I add dependencies to my feature in the Plugins and Fragments editor Because when I click Synchronize in the .product file, a new collection of dependencies is generated based on my feature.xml which usually doesnt have enough plugins to run. Its very hard to add onebyone, if we have a screencapture of the minimum, required plugins list as I said above.p  pButton Add required on Dependencies tab of .product file is not helpful in this case.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 3 pIm aware of HTML objects and how to navigate  interact with a page through VBA using those.  However, the page Im attempting to automate now uses a java applet which utilizes ActiveX controls.  I was wondering if there is any way to pass information to the activeX controls on the web page through VBA.  Ive attempted watching the locals view as the page loads, but frankly nothing there is very descriptive, and half of it simply reports back access denied or access restricted.  One of those anyway, I dont have it in front of me at the moment.  Ive been googling the heck out of this, but everything comes back with AcitiveX controls inserted in workbooks and access, both of which I already understand.p  pI dont really have any code for this yet because as far as I can see at the moment, Im not sure there is a way to access the controls.  Ill refine the question as I find more information and as people respond, and Ill post code that Im using and testing as appropriate.  p  pSorry again for asking another codeless question, but Im not really sure where to go with this one.p  pEDIT  Decided to add more information.  The webpage Im attempting to do this with is a thin client for Siebels CRM software, now distributed by Oracle.  For what it is worth, opening the page does download and register some DLL files that seem to be associated with the page, but without doccumentation, they dont seem to be of much use.  I just thought Id throw that in if perhaps someone knows of a way that those libraries might be of use to me in this case.  Unfortunately I do not have access to Siebels web automation library.p

Negative 3 pI am trying to understand the way Java resolves relative path in while creating a codeFilecode object.p  pOS used Windowsp  pFor the below snippet, I am getting an codeIOExceptioncode as it cannot find the pathp  precodeTest public void testPathConversion          File f  new Filetesttest.txt         try              f.createNewFile             System.out.printlnf.getPath             System.out.printlnf.getAbsolutePath                 System.out.printlnf.getCanonicalPath          catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace           codepre  pMy understanding here is, Java treats the path provided as absolute and returns an error when the path does not exist. So it makes sense.p  pWhen I update the above code to use relative path   p  precodeTest     public void testPathConversion          File f  new Filetest..test.txt         try              f.createNewFile             System.out.printlnf.getPath             System.out.printlnf.getAbsolutePath                 System.out.printlnf.getCanonicalPath          catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace                   codepre  pIt creates a new file and provides the below outputp  precodetest..test.txt CJavaForTesterstest..test.txt CJavaForTesterstest.txt codepre  pIn this case, my assumption is, even though the path provided doesnt exist, because the path contains .., java treats this as a relative path and creates the file in the codeuser.dircode.  So this also makes sense.p  pBut if I update the relative path as belowp  precode   Test     public void testPathConversion          File f  new Filetest....test.txt         try              f.createNewFile             System.out.printlnf.getPath             System.out.printlnf.getAbsolutePath             System.out.printlnf.getCanonicalPath          catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace               codepre  pThen I get IOException Access is denied.p  pMy questions arep  ol liwhy codetest..test.txtcode is treated as a relative path and creates the file in codeuser.dircode butcodetest....test.txtcode returns an error Where does it attempt to create the file for the path codetest....test.txtcodeli lipWhen the specified relative path is not found, the file seems to be created in the codeuser.dircode. So, it appears to me that the below two scenarios does the same thingp  precodescenario 1 File f  new Filetest..test.txt f.createNewFile  scenario 2 File f  new Filetest.txt f.createNewFile codepreli ol  pSo is there a real world case where one would use scenario 1 instead of scenario 2 p  pI suppose I am missing something obvious here or have fundamentally misunderstood relative paths. I went through the Java docs for File and I am not able to find an explanation for this. There are quite a few questions posted in Stack Overflow regarding relative paths, but the ones I looked up were for specific scenarios and not exactly about how relative paths are resolved. p  pIt will be great if someone could please explain me how this works or point to some related linksp

When the fields are updated the composite does not seem to update. I have to open the composite and close it again. Is there a way of doing this automatically in JavaScriptp  pI have tried the following ideasp  pIdea 1p  pXrm.Page.data.entity.save This is recomended at a hrefhttpcommunity.dynamics.comcrmbmagnetismsolutionscrmblogarchive20131022workingwithdynamicscrm2013compositefieldsflyoutmenu.aspxhttpcommunity.dynamics.comcrmbmagnetismsolutionscrmblogarchive20131022workingwithdynamicscrm2013compositefieldsflyoutmenu.aspxa This is not any good as my customers want to view the composite before saving the page.

They would like to decide when to do this themselves.p  pIdea 2p  pXrm.Page.data.refresh This is not really what I wanted as I do not want to refresh the whole page. I just want to refresh the composite. Also it bring up a popup that warns you about not having saved the page which will be annoying for my customers.p  pIdea 3p  pWriting the address from the address lines to the composite. This feels like a nasty hack. There is probably more than one way of doing this. I used the function Xrm.Page.getAttributeaddress1composite.attribute.setValueForCompositeField.p  pI do not like this for the following reasonsp  ol liThis is a hack as it is not using the system functionality of the done button to write the data.li liYou do not get the system formatting you get with the done button although this will get done when the form is saved so it is not so bad.li liIn the future if customers are allowed to add their own composite fields it could cause problems as the field names could be different.li liIt requires me to write extra code for each form that has a composite which has fields with different schema names. E.g. I have to write different code for forms with ShipTo and BillTo addresses as the code for the account form will not work. li ol  pAnother idea was to set the focus to the composite field after a change has been made to any of the fields inside the composite. Xrm.Page.data.entity.attributes.getaddress1composite.controls.get0.setFocus  This is the best idea so for but it is far from perfect. This forces the user to press the done button and hence the fields will be written. I was hoping for something more automated.p  pstrongMy Question What would be great is if there was a way to click the composite done button in JavaScript. This would give me the formatting of the done button and the automation I need.strongp  p14042014 Since posting this question I have been in contact with Microsoft and they say there is no supported way of clicking the done button via a program.p  pCheers.p  pOly.p

Negative 3 pso heres my problem. I have two divs, and i want to be able to see both of them when i scroll down the page. Both divs are in the same parent container.

I gave positionfixed to the top div, and position relative to the bottom one. The fixed one now scrools but the relative doesnt follow it or stay beneath it.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 3 pI have a RESTful web service locating in a domain name with SSL certificate lets call this domain nameserver, A.

However, when I make the same call to this same web service using a browser I have tried IE and Firefox from a server with SSL certificate lets call this server, B, I get a 500 error.p  pAt first, I thought it was a firewall issue.  But upon checking, Server A and Server B are within the same network.  So, they should be able to talk to each other on any port.  After that, I thought it is because of some security settings in my browsers being too high.  But after changing the security settings, I am still getting a 500 error when I call the web service using a browser on Server B.p  pThe web service is written in Java and is run on tomcat.  Any idea on why I am getting a 500 error would be greatly appreciated.p  pThe following is the stack trace.p  blockquote   pjava.lang.RuntimeException org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault

Negative 3 pI know this cannot be as hard as I am making it..  Ive built a structure to encode things into Asn1 using BouncyCastle, C, no problem.  p  pTrying to extract an integer back out is easy enough BouncyCastle DerInteger object.Value.IntValue , but DerOctetStrings doesnt seem to have direct functionality  likely because it can represent ascii strings AND byte[]. p  pSo 04 02 46 45 represents both the byte[]  0x46, 0x45  and the string FEp  p... and I cant figure out how to get either, short of manually stripping off the tag and using the length to grab the bytes that follow.  All the BouncyCastle methods seem to shoot back out all the octets  04 02 46 45  or encode them again  04 06 04 02 46 45 p  pId really like to stick to BouncyCastle just to keep it parallel to the encoder I wrote, and because it has builtin checking of the length field that throws properly.  .NET is fine if I have to go that route and it is easier.  And worse case Ill do it all manually but.. thats ugly.p  pMain question How do you use builtin functionality to extract the content bytes out of a DerOctetString without the tag and length Secondary question What is the easiest way to take those output bytes into a normal C stringp  p Aside I have only managed to find two posts similar to this on here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2409618howdoidecodeaderencodedstringinjavaHow do I decode a DER encoded string in Javaa  Which goes directly to the string version, cant just grab the bytes outp  pAnd a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions13213846bouncycastlejavadecodingderencodedoctetstringsBouncyCastle Java  Decoding DER encoded OCTET stringsa But that only talks about a java library so it doesnt help mep  p Edit Resolved the main portion of the question.

I followed a tutorial on sanwebe.com.p  pMy page shows my products and shows a cart which can be updated perfectly, I then created a final order page for the customer to fill in their delivery details and payment details and I wanted my script to send all this information, as well as the items in the cart to a table in my database.p  pI am managing to send the details over using a SQL statement but the problem is that when a customer buys product 1 and product 2 it will only send the data for the first product in the cart. So if the person buys 3 product 1s it will send it over fine but when mixing different products it fails.p  pI think maybe there needs to be some form of loop or something to pass multiple itemsp  porder.phpp  precodeltphp sessionstart includeonceconfig.php gt ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt lttitlegtShopping Cartlttitlegt ltlink hrefstylestyle.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery2.1.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery.validate.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   document.readyfunction        orderform.validate    Select the form using its idname and apply the validate function to it.      end ready ltscriptgt  ltbodygt ltdiv idproductswrappergt     lth1gtComplete Orderlth1gt     ltdiv classordergt       ltform idorderformactionprocessorder.php methodpostgt     lth2gtDeliverylth2gt     ltpgtltlabel forfirstnamegtFirst Nameltlabelgt ltinput typetext namefirstname classrequiredgtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel forlastnamegtLast Nameltlabelgt ltinput typetext namelastname classrequiredgtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel foremailgtEmailltlabelgt ltinput typetext nameemail classrequired emailgtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel foraddressgtAddressltlabelgt ltinput typetext nameaddress classrequired gtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel forcitygtCityltlabelgt ltinput typetext namecity classrequired gtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel forpostcodegtPost Codeltlabelgt ltinput typetext namepostcode classrequired gtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel forcountrygtCountryltlabelgt ltinput typetext namecountry classrequired gtltpgt     lth2gtPaymentlth2gt     ltpgtltlabel forcardnumbergtCard Numberltlabelgt ltinput typetext namecardnumber classrequiredgtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel forexpiregtExpiration Dateltlabelgt ltinput typetext nameexpire classrequired digitsgtltpgt     ltpgtltlabel forscodegtSecurity Codeltlabelgt ltinput typetext namescode classrequired digitsgtltpgt     ltp classsubmitgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmit gtltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdiv classshoppingcartgt lth2gtYour Orderlth2gt ltphp     currenturl  base64encodeurlhttp.SERVER[HTTPHOST].SERVER[REQUESTURI]     ifissetSESSION[products]              total  0         echo ltulgt         cartitems  0         foreach SESSION[products] as cartitm                     productcode  cartitm[code]            results  mysqligtquerySELECT productname,productdesc, price FROM products WHERE productcodeproductcode LIMIT 5            obj  resultsgtfetchobject              echo ltli classcartitmgt             echo ltspan classremoveitmgtlta hrefcartupdate.phpremovep.cartitm[code].ampreturnurl.currenturl.gtamptimesltagtltspangt             echo ltdiv classppricegt.currency.objgtprice.ltdivgt             echo ltdiv classproductinfogt             echo lth3gt.objgtproductname.

Negative 3 pIm using ACRA to report exceptions and would like to include the last API call and potentially the response body as part of the custom data that can be supplied.  Ive been looking over the available a hrefhttpsquare.github.ioretrofitjavadocretrofitRestAdapter.Builder.html relnofollowRestAdapter.Builder interfacesa but dont see one that supplies what Im looking for.  Effectively, Id like access to whats put into Logcat when full logging is enabled.p  pIs there a way to get the last URL, headers, and response body within Retrofit so I can set custom ACRA fieldsp
Negative 3 pI am making an app that combines 2 images on a canvas, amp lets you share it. It works fine in a browser when run from a local webserver, but not when run in cordova. All foreign images come from dataURIs of SVGs in a JSON file from a remote webserver.p  pflow is like thisp  ol lidownload JSON array of dataURIs of SVGs from remote serverli liget image from camera or shim that returns dataURI of test image, if cordova camera is not availableli lisplat photo to canvasli lichoose SVG image from list comes from JSON of dataURIsli limove SVG aroundli liSave complete image with codecanvas.toDataURLcode to remote serverli ol  pAll steps work on local test webserver, and I have verified that both images are dataURIs from camera, and from remote JSON SVG. p  pI am using codeimage.crossOrigin  code on both the SVG amp the camera image before they are put on canvas, even though I dont think I need to.p  pI get this error in codeadb logcatcode when I attempt to load dataURI of final canvas to display to user, before sending, in step 6p  precodeError SECURITYERR DOM Exception 18 at fileandroidassetwwwlibionicjsionic.bundle.min.js114 codepre  pThis error is supposed to be when you try to access canvas image composed of foreignorigin images not dataURIs, right Am I dong something wrong herep  pI am using Cordova 3.4.10.1.0 on Android 4.4.2p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAlso, strangely, it works fine, if I comment out the part where it should draw the image with a SVG dataURI.  I doublechecked it, and it is indeed a codedataimagesvgxmlbase64,...code URI.p

There is a lot of commonality between the types and I have various interfaces for the groupings of datatypes such as 2D shapes, 3D shapes etc but the one interface that all objects have in common is the IMapObject interface that has the render, preRender, move etc calls. p  pThe flow of operation for the draw functions is something like thisp  ol liCheck function arguments.li liCreate MapObject.li liAdd MapObject to map layer allows WorldWind to call render on it.li liUpdate internal map that has a list of MapObjects and who owns them.li liReturn the ID of the MapObject to the caller.li ol  pThe flow of operation for the update functions is something like thisp  ol liCheck the function arguments.li liCheck that the caller owns the objects.li liCreate new emCallableem that will run the MapObjects updateXXX method.li liPass the callable to a emFutureTaskem where it will then be fired off into the EDT.li liAwait the return via emgetem and return this back to the caller.li ol  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pNormally I would not be too concerned with the setup of this but there are about 50 different types of shape that can be put on the map. That means 50 different drawXXX methods and 50 updateXXX methods each with different arguments but very similar code underneath.  I have a rather large file with lots of repetitive code which is not really that great for maintainability.p  pstrongMy Thoughtsstrongp  pI need to keep the different shape type classes so will still need to have the different constructors for each one but I think I can generalize the update calls. If I remove the specific emupdate2DCircleem, emupdate2DRectagleem etc.... in the shape classes and replace with a simple update from the base emIMapObjectem interface and use varags I should be able to funnel all the RPC update calls into one method like sop  precodeupdate2DCircleArgsreturn shape.updateShapeArgs update2DRectangleArgsreturn shape.updateShapeArgs codepre  pand each shape have the implemenationp  precodeprivate boolean updateShapeObject ... codepre  pI understand that im loosing type checking with the varags but the type checking is done on the RPC implementation that made the call.p  pAnother thought I had was to not update the shape but create a new one each time the drawupdate method is called but this is slightly more complicated by the fact that the shape might be changing from internal WorldWind methods on EDT and the RPC methods happen on a different thread so I would need some sort of shape locking.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pFrom what I have explained, does it look like any of my proposed solutions are the correct way to do it or my existing setup was OK Is there are better solution using some design pattern ive not thought ofp  pemIve tried to make this as much a programming question as possible as opposed to opinion to meet the SO rules although I do understand how it may read but this is not my intention emp

Negative 3 pI need to find a way to test my exception handling in a function I wrote called codehpxparallelcopycode. Other functions in the library such as codehpxparalleltransformcode are easy to test as a predicate can be passed in which throws an exception, but codecopycode takes no predicate.p  pI think my best solution would be to use an iterator that throws on dereference somehow, though Im not quite sure how to go about doing this......any other suggestions to solving this problem are welcome as well.

Now, Project C references Project B.

Is there a way, the dependencies can be compiled into the dll for Project C, so that i only have one dll which conatains all its dependencies as well as the actual projectp  pThe Reason is that I want to load ProjectC.dll at runtime in a different solution. But when i do so, the dependencies are missing.p  pHow would one usually handle thatp

Id preferably like to handle as much of this as possible with C.p  pI was thinking of using something like the AmpKit LINK to handle the guitar input.p  pWhere do I start with thisp  pFeel free to recommend any other input devices or languages.p  pThanks, Cal.p  pInput device  Peavey AmpKit LINKp  pa hrefhttpwww.soundsliveshop.compPeaveyAmpKitLiNKPVAMPKITLINKCAWELAID1830897475ampCAGPSPNplaampgclidCNnB943RmsECFabMtAod6QgAng relnofollowhttpwww.soundsliveshop.compPeaveyAmpKitLiNKPVAMPKITLINKCAWELAID1830897475ampCAGPSPNplaampgclidCNnB943RmsECFabMtAod6QgAnga p  pproposed IDE Xamarin cross platform IOSAndroid from Cp  pa hrefhttpxamarin.com relnofollowhttpxamarin.comap
Negative 3 pI have made a simple color detection script, using the inrange function of OpenCV, and now I want to export the program to another computer, which does not have the OpenCV library installed or the path editing involved with setting it up for use in Visual Studio, which I have been programming in, in C. The includes involved arep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include opencv2highguihighgui.hpp include opencv2imgprocimgproc.hpp codepre  pWhen I build solution on the PC used to do the programming, everything works fine, but when I then export it to the other computer, I get error messagep  precodeThe application was unable to start correctly 0xc000007b. Click OK to  close the application. codepre  pOut of curiosity I have tried including the OpenCV library and setting it up as on the other computer, but without success, and I was really hoping there would be an easier way of doing it as well, since it would otherwise make distribution quite a hassle.p  pAny help appreciated.p

Negative 3 pI have a question about why I need to use the codemcode flag to the codesetfontcode command to be able to correctly input specialdiactric characters like  or  Polish. Ive read codeman setfontcode but Im slightly at a loss. It saysp  p... If the console is in utf8 mode see unicodestart1 then the  kernel  expects that  user program output is coded as UTF8 see utf87, and converts that to Unicode ucs2.  Otherwise, a translation table is used from the 8bit program output to 16bit Unicode values. Such a translation table is called a Unicode console map. There are four of them three built into the kernel, the  fourth  settable  using the  m  option of setfont. ...p  pSuitable arguments for the m option are for example 88591, 88592, ..., 885915, cp437, ..., cp1250. ...p  pMy console and tty are in UnicodeUTF8 modep  precode stty speed 38400 baud line  0 iutf8  kbdmode The keyboard is in Unicode UTF8 mode codepre  pWhen I callp  precode loadkeys pl  setfont v lat216 Loading 256char 8x16 font from file usrsharekbdconsolefontslat216.psfu.gz Loading Unicode mapping table... codepre  pI can print all diactric characters from a filep  precode cat chars.txt   codepre  pbut cannot input them correctly  when I press LeftAlta, all I get is a question mark, and also the same question mark is printed.p  pWhen the command isp  precodesetfont v m 88592 lat216  or just add mapscrn 88592 after the previous call to setfont codepre  pit all works fine.p  pThis means that the translation table is needed, which would mean that either the console is not in Unicode mode, and some user program which one would this be getty it only is a problem with input is outputting ISO 88592 latin2 bytes instead of UTF8.p  pWhat is going onp

Negative 3 pIm creating a window with codeWSEXLAYEREDcode and setting a color key to it using codeSetLayeredWindowAttributescode.

Im creating an codeIDirectDrawSurface7code on the window and  Im codeBltcodeing some pixels to it. some of the pixels are colored with the color key, but I dont see them as transparent, they just appear in the color key.p  pIs there something inherent in DirectDraw surface that conflicts with layered window color keyingbr When im setting an alpha value using codeSetLayeredWindowAttributescode, that seem to work fine with the DirectDraw surface and it does indeed appear translucent.p

Negative 3 pWe are using Rest API V2 that we use a c Winform application.  We create an envelope with a document in it using the api.

It started out with a few users having the issue and seems to be happening more often.p  pAdditional Info. It doesnt seem to matter on size of document  what you are doing .

I tried to use the Behavior protocol rounding and add the scale but it didnt work for me. p  pIs it working as designed and should I just use a formatter to add the 0 when retrieving the 11.9 from Core Data or is there any step Im missing p  pThanks.p  precode    NSDecimalNumberHandler behavior  [[NSDecimalNumberHandler alloc] initWithRoundingModeNSRoundPlain                                                                                               scale2                                                                                    raiseOnExactnessNO                                                                                     raiseOnOverflowNO                                                                                    raiseOnUnderflowNO                                                                                 raiseOnDivideByZeroNO]      [NSDecimalNumber setDefaultBehaviorbehavior]       NSDecimalNumber priceDecimal      NSDictionary locale  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectcurrentLocaleSeparator forKeyNSLocaleDecimalSeparator]     priceDecimal  [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithStringprice localelocale]     priceDecimal  [priceDecimal decimalNumberByRoundingAccordingToBehaviorbehavior] codepre
Negative 3 pSearched Stackoverflow, and Google the past week, but I cant resolve my problem. I got to the point when I have to ask a question here. I hope I just lost in the overcomplicated forest really.p  pI have built an application in vb.net using sql server. Everything works like a dream. I use SQL server on the machine I develop my application. The application will need to access the data from the server from other machines, e.g. in the workplace from several machines, plus across the business...  I have managed to pull data from the server using my laptop different machine, hovever when I connect to a different newtwork then the application throwing and error message after try to log in. When the laptop is on the same network e.g. AndroidAP, TalkTalk... will let me to pull data remotely, but when the server machine connected on e.g. TalkTalk network, and the laptop connected to AndroidAP then error message comes up.  My server machine updates the online DB table with the new IP address, and when the application from other machine try to connect will pull the IP address from the online table, and creating the connection string and try to connect. p  pLike I said, when both machines are connected to the same network, they can read and write data to the database, but when the connected networks are different then it will fail. p  pCould you please help me out in this matterp  pThank youp

Negative 3 pFirst, hello to everyone, Im kinda new here, altough this site has helped me with lots of stuff. Heres my problem, Ive made images in s with text behind them, so that when you hover with your pointer over it, the image slides to the side and you can read the text. Pretty simple. Now the problem that Im having is that when I lower the screen sizeeg view it on an Android, the responsive design kinda doesnt work for those images because theres some weird spacing to the left, even though the image can fit on that screen size.p  pHeres the site with the problem I use it for learning purposes  a hrefhttpjigsawpotatosite.comeze.com relnofollow titleMy site lt3Thisap

Negative 3 pIm trying to use networkx and Gephi to create a 3D representation of a polymer system. I have x,y,z coordinates for each atom which have their own id numbers.

Negative 3 pI would like to merge all the files under a folder and its subfolders into a file codetotal.txtcode, so I tryp  pcodefind . type f exec cat   gt total.txtcodep  pand the output cant be redirectedp  ppipe cant work eitherp  pcodefind . type f exec cat    cat gt total.txtcodep  pIt maybe caused by codeexeccode which takes all the arguments after it as the command p  pIs it right And how to fix it Or is there a better way to achieve this.p  pAny help will be appreciated p
Negative 3 pIm currently creating a Facebook Canvas game and at the moment I have a php script which inserts player data received from an AJAX post into my database. This data is taken from Facebooks Graph API in a Javascript function and then sent by AJAX to the php script. Everythings working perfectly right now, but its not secure against SQL injection.p  pI want to make my SQL queries more secure so I have been reading up on Prepared Statements, Bound ParametersParameterized Statements and Sanitizing Data, but Im finding it all a little confusing.p  pI understand how SQL injection works, and the idea behind using a prepared statement, but Im having difficulty implementing it when trying to insert data thats been received by AJAX. This is my most recent attemptp  precodeltphp  sessionstart requireonce facebookphpsdkv44.0devautoload.php  use FacebookHttpClientsFacebookHttpable use FacebookHttpClientsFacebookCurl use FacebookHttpClientsFacebookCurlHttpClient use FacebookEntitiesAccessToken use FacebookEntitiesSignedRequest use FacebookFacebookSession use FacebookFacebookSignedRequestFromInputHelper use FacebookFacebookCanvasLoginHelper use FacebookFacebookRedirectLoginHelper use FacebookFacebookRequest use FacebookFacebookResponse use FacebookFacebookSDKException use FacebookFacebookRequestException use FacebookFacebookOtherException use FacebookFacebookAuthorizationException use FacebookGraphObject use FacebookGraphUser use FacebookGraphSessionInfo  FacebookSessionsetDefaultApplicationmyappid, myappsecret  servername  myservername username  myusername password  mypassword dbname  mydbname   Create connection conn  new mysqliservername, username, password, dbname   Check connection if conngtconnecterror      dieConnection failed  . conngtconnecterror    prepare and bind stmt  conngtprepareINSERT INTO player fbid, fname, lname, email, gender VALUES  , , , ,  stmtgtbindparamsssss, userid, userfirstname, userlastname, useremail, usergender   set parameters these variables are received from AJAX and execute userid  POST[userid] userfirstname  POST[userfirstname] userlastname  POST[userlastname] useremail  POST[useremail] usergender  POST[usergender] stmtgtexecute  echo New records created successfully  stmtgtclose conngtclose gt codepre  pSadly nothing is inserting into my database when I try this.

Negative 3 pOur line of business application uses a Word document as a template, fills in the pertinent information and converts it to PDF, which it returns to the user.p  pThat all works fine except for one thing. We use an image of our companys logo on the lead page and in the footer. In one resolution e.g. 100, it looks fine. But at higher resolutions e.g. 250, it has several noticeable jaggies the diagonals have noticeable ragged edges. Tweaking the image, were able to make it look good at the higher zoom value, but then it looks terrible at lower zoom values.p  pCurrently, were using a PNG, but weve tried JPG and it doesnt improve the jaggy problem. In fact, it looks worse at higher resolution because of JPG compression. I think a vector image would solve the problem and we have the logo in vector format, but I havent found any vector formats that Word supports.p  pI dont really have any code to show, since we dont do anything with the image in the code we just take the document and plug in our values, none of which touch the logo the template already contains the image.p  pWe are using Word 2013 32bit on Windows 8.1 though some of our developers use Windows 7. We use the .NET PdfDocument class to generate the PDF.p  pAny ideas on how to get Word to be better at retaining image quality Or is this a PDF issuep

Negative 3 pWe have multiple web services that provide access to some large data extractions. Theyre implemented as http handlers, so we can stream the result directly into the response stream. We already have anonymous and HTTP basic authentication working on a single endpoint. We would now like to add Windows Authentication, so internal users can get access to all the same data that they can get from the internal web app.p  pHowever, I can only get Windows Authentication working if I disable anonymous authentication in IISs configuration. Obviously, this means that anonymous requests to this endpoint stop working. I didnt test HTTP Basic, but I would guess they would stop working too.p  pI know we could create a new endpoint, just for Windows authenticated requests. But, is there any way to get it to work with a single endpoint, like we already have with anonymous and basic authenticationp  pSince anonymous is enabled, users cant make authenticated requests with their web browser, but were fine with this limitation. I tried creating a HTML page that makes a XHR request and set withCredentials to true, but the web service only sees the username when anonymous auth is disabled in IIS. I also created a console app that tries to force network credentials in different ways. But again, the web service only sees the username when anonymous requests are disabled.p  pDoes anyone know if its possible to achieve anonymous and Windows authentication on a single URLp

Negative 3 pI used to think that when you declare a variable in the global namespace, in the context of a web browser it becomes attached to the window object.

See this from the Chrome consolep  precodevar a gt undefined window.hasOwnPropertya gt true window.a  0 gt 0 delete window.a gt false window.hasOwnPropertya gt true  so its still there  window.a gt 0  window.b  undefined gt undefined window.hasOwnPropertyb gt true window.b  0 gt 0 delete window.b gt true window.hasOwnPropertyb gt false window.b gt undefined codepre  pCan someone shed some light on thisp

Negative 3 pIm a beginner using Gimp and Im trying to create some buttons for my app 60x60px. I deleted some areas at the side of the image, so that the actual visible image is more like 50x50 pixel. The first import to my layout worked correctly so the image in my layout was wrapped around the visible 50x50 area of the image, after some editing and re importing it always wraps around the 60x60 image size, but thats not how i want it. I tried several things and im pretty sure I did not change any properties, so why isnt it ignoring the deleted parts of the image anymorep  ppicture here a hrefhttpi.imgur.comROJsDQA.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comROJsDQA.pngap  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecode            ltLinearLayout                             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                             androidlayoutaboveidlinearLayout7                             androidlayoutalignRightidlinearLayout7 gt                              ltButton                                 androidididbuttonEnter9                                 styleandroidattrbuttonStyleSmall                                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                                 androidbackgrounddrawablepixelnumberbutton                                 androidtext9 gt                                                          ltButton                                 androidididbuttonEnter7                                 styleandroidattrbuttonStyleSmall                                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                                 androidbackgrounddrawablepixelnumberbuttonmed                                 androidtext7 gt                                                           ltButton                                 androidididbuttonEnter8                                 styleandroidattrbuttonStyleSmall                                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                                 androidbackgrounddrawablepixelnumberbuttonmed                                 androidtext8 gt                                                                                                        ltLinearLayoutgtcodepre div div p

Negative 3 pAddition to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31537310springbatchwheredoestheprocessrunSpring Batch  where does the process runap  pOnce every hour i get a huge file with Usage Data for a set of services.

Negative 3 pIm looking for a faster way than using a forloop to select a varying number of rows within different factorslevels in a dataframe with a following manipulation of the rows. p  pThe data Im working on contains a number of cells and a larger and varying number of points within each cell. Given the characteristics of the cell, I have to remove different numbers of points from these cells.p  pThe simple example given here contains two tables table1 with the cells and their characteristics and table2 with points and their corresponding cell number. Column 2 in each table contains information on how many points to remove from the dataset. Column 3 in table 2 gives the density of points within the cell theyre in.

Reason is that if runif is used on each point individually it introduces more randomness than I like. The best solution Ive found for this approach is a quite slow one, Approach2p  precodelist1 lt list fori in 1nrowtable1    select all points from the same cell   a lt table2[table2[,1]i,]    randomly select a number of those points   b lt samplenrowa, a[,2]    test lt lengthb gt 0    save the results in a list   list1[[i]] lt as.numericrownamesif lengthtest  a else a[b,]     combine the list to a vector vect2 lt unlistlist1  the result, a table with all the dropped points table2[vect2,] codepre  pIs there a way to code Approach2 in a way that comes even close to the speed of Approach1 If so, what would it look likep  pThanks. p

Negative 3 pAs we know all dynamically allocated memories need to be freed using free by the programmer himself. For the variables which the programmer himself creates and allocates memory to them almost there is not a problem as he knows what to call free for. But what about pointers returned from glibc functions like getenv. At first I thought I needed to free the memory pointed by the result of getenv but then noticed the man saysp  blockquote   pAs typically implemented, getenv returns a pointer to a string   within the environment list.The caller must take care not to modify   this string, since that would change the environment of the processp blockquote  pThis means the function getenv hasnt called malloc to create a new space for the string whose address is returning. So which of the pointers returned from these functions explicitly needs to be freedp

Negative 3 pI want to save not only Red, Green, Blue and Alpha in my Image. Every pixel also needs ZDepth information, like, how far it was away from the camera. Furthermore, I need to display the Image in a JFrame,  so I cant use my custom Image class, but instead I need a BufferedImage or a subclass of it. The ZDepth shouldnt be visible in the JFrame. I just want to store it.p  pIve read much about the BufferedImage class.  I assume that I will have to extend classes like SampleModel or ColorModel, but I cant figure out how that should be done. A nice solution would be to instantiate a new BufferedImage but with a custom Pixelclass that also stores depth, without actually extending the BufferedImage. But any solution and any idea will be appreciatedp  pstrongDoes anybody know, which classes I have to extend, in order to save more information in every Pixelstrongp

Negative 3 pIn my configuration, I need my RPis to get a static IP at boot time. Of course no problem setting a static IP by hand. My problem is that I want to be able to define the IP address in a text file which is accessible on the boot partition.p  pWhen opening any Pi SD card on a windows machine, one can see some files. These files, when booting on the Pi are accessible in the boot folder.p  pThe idea is to have a text file in that folder with the IP address wanted. I can set the IP using any windows text editor. When booting on SD card, the RPi opens the text file and assigns the IP to the device.p  pWhat I tried so farp  ul liusing ifconfig in rc.local file to redefine the current IP of eth0. This works well but not all the time. And this supposes eth0 is already up, which supposes in turn that the IP has been already defined, for example through dhcp.li liusing ifconfig in if.upd script to do the same as above. Doesnt work all the time either. I suspect the script is called over and over again because each time I change the IP using ifconfig, the ifup.d is triggered.li ul  pWhat I actually needp  ul liwhen RPi boots, and embeforeem it loads the ethernet drivers, a script must read the content of a text file in boot and assign the RPis IP address based on the content of that file.li ul  pFinally, my application needs to run headless, so no screen, no login.

It also ask to print this key in ascending order,and the algorithm must works in linear time, so I have to implement an inordervisitlike algorithm. Now, I have written an algorithm that works in linear time but in some case it didnt work as a inordervisit and so the printed key arent in ascending order, but I dont know how to manage to overtake this obstacles. How can I compare the left visit and the right without first of all implement a recursion on the left and on the rightp  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt   typedef struct node          int dato     struct node left         struct node right node   typedef struct ret          int sin         int des         res   node inseriscinode root, int insert   ifrootNULL          node  newnodemallocsizeofnode         newgtleftNULL         newgtrightNULL         newgtdatoinsert         return new   ifrootgtdato lt insert rootgtright inseriscirootgtright,insert  else rootgtleft  inseriscirootgtleft,insert  return root    res sommanode  u  res ret res ciaosx res ciaodx  ifuNULL return  ifugtleftNULL ampamp ugtrightNULL                  ret.sin0         ret.des0         return ret           ifugtleftNULL ampamp ugtrightNULL                  ciaosxsommaugtleft         ret.sin ciaosx.sin1         ciaodxsommaugtright         ret.des ciaodx.des1          ifret.sin gt ret.des                                   printfdn,ugtdato                          return ret           ifugtleftNULL ampamp ugtrightNULL                  ciaosxsommaugtleft         ret.sin ciaosx.sin1         ret.des 0         printfdn,ugtdato          return ret           ifugtleftNULL ampamp ugtright NULL                  ciaodxsommaugtright         ret.des ciaodx.des 1         ret.sin0         return ret                 int main  int n,i,x scanfd,ampn node rootNULL fori0iltni          scanfd,ampx         rootinserisciroot,x   sommaroot  return 0  codepre

Negative 3 pIm evaluating celery for my task queuing workflow. My requirements are slightly unique. The system has the notion of projects and each project will have a potentially large number of tasks associated with it. I would like the queuing system to dispatch these tasks in a fair way in that one project with very many tasks to process will not starve other projects.p  pFor example, say that ProjectA has 100 tasks associated with it and all of those tasks are submitted simultaneously. The first 5 tasks are pulled off and submitted to the 5 workers. While the first 5 tasks are processing ProjectB is submitted with another 100 tasks. ProjectB should not have to wait for ProjectA to complete all 100 of its tasks in order to get some processing time. Instead, once a worker becomes free, it should process a ProjectB task. Then the next worker to become free should process a ProjectA task, and so forth in a roundrobin fashion.p  pMy thought was that I could dynamically create new queues for each project and have all the workers pull from all the queues such as described in a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions18730710createdynamicqueueswithcelerythis SO posta. However, according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14768923458310this answera celery workers will actually process tasks in the order they were submitted, regardless of the queue they are in which seems a little peculiar too me. This does not work for me because it would cause starvation of projects submitted after the currently processing one.p  pCan Celery be used to implement my requirements If not, is there a recommended best practice to implement my requirementsp
