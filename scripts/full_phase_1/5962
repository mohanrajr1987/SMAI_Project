Positive 5962 pMy organization is making the transition from SVN to Git hosted on GitHub and we have basically adopted the gitflow branching model.p  pWe have been using pull requests to merge between branches.   We use the GitHub web interface to process the merge and close the request.p  pPull requests are merged with noff.  So a merge commit will occur in the destination branch.p  pSo....  We merge from strongdevelopstrong to strongmasterstrong often  so what happens after the merge is the develop branch will be both embehindem due to the merge commits not being in master and emaheadem due to new work being done in develop.p  pOver many iterations, we end up with develop branch is both 23 commits behind and 7 commits ahead of master  which seems ridiculous.   Should we just not worry about this  Should we merge manually and not through the GitHuib web interface  p
Positive 5962 pI have three branches master, A and B.p  pBranch A and B should be independent to each other. After the pull requests, master got updated from A and B.

This is happening because of branch A have revert merge B commit.p  pHow I can remove revert merge branch B and merge branch B commits I tried to use git rebase command, but it doesnt help me, git creates anthoer branch that is not in pull request.p
Positive 5962 pI have large project in a git repo and Ive open source certain parts of it. The open sourced parts have their own git repos in separate folders within the parent repo. However, as soon as I initialized a repo in one of the inner directories, those files are no longer added and tracked by the parent git repo.p  pI dont like this because the parent repo wont work if the child repos are on the wrong commit. This is a big problem if you want to go back in history. So I want to be able to track all files, including the files in the subrepos in the parent repo. It seems easy enough.

Positive 5962 pIm having some frustrations with Git. I was under the impression that Git will automatically take care of all the merging with the simplest 3 commands  git add . or git add all  git commit m Comment  git push origin master. But often we face problems after doing this like  having duplicate files probably after moving some files in another folder, not being able to merge for some reason and the worst of all, working on the project you pulled yesterday, saving it, then trying to commit it to the remote branch when you get an git error message that the branch was updated and I have to pull the new changes and after pulling the new changes, get all your locally done progress be reverted back or overwritten completely without your personally added code.p  pIm a bit frustrated, it seems that Git isnt something as easy to work with as I believed.

Positive 5962 pin my Company, weve got a lot of repositories in one private github organization not accessible publically. Ideally, all developers should have read access to all repos in that organization, while just having write access to the repositories of their project. p  pFor that, Ive set up a couple of github teams for each project. Each of that teams should have write access for some repositories easy to configure in the repo settings but read access for all other repositories. Im struggling with this one, as I can only grant read access to each individual repository. This is not only painful because we have a lot of repositories but will also not automatically work when new repos are created. p  pIs there anything, Im missing to set this up properly p  pThanks, Matthiasp

Positive 5962 pWe use git for source control. Each time there is a commit from developers, a script would modify a build file and checks in the file. The script commits the build file with a message that follows a pattern. So the commit history is like the followingp  ul liscript checkin build file 003li lifix this bugli liscript checkin build file 002li liresolve that storyli ul  pWhat I want to do is to remove all commits by the script. Now, obviously, this is very different from removing a particular commit.p  pI have the freedom to start a brand new repository by copying from existing repository, but I still want to preserve the developers commit history as much as possible, while getting rid of the scripts commit history.p  pIs that possiblep  pNote  the scripts commits only changed this single file that is, the build file, and did not change any other file. And, no developers commit ever changed this particular file.p  pSo far what I have been doing is to run bfg tool to delete that particular build file from the git repo. Only the commits from the script ever changed the build file, so I am hoping by removing the build file, the associated commits would be squashed away by git.p  pBut, what I found is the build file is gone, yet all commits are preserved, and those commits, curiously, having 0 changes.p  pSo my next question is is it possible to ask git to remove commits with 0 changesp

Positive 5962 pI have recently discovered that you can connect the strongEclipse Task Liststrong with GitHub directly thus allowing a nice synchronization between a selected repository and what your are doing in the IDE related to that repository taskwise. Im using strongEclipse Mars 4.5.0strong.p  pI have created a GitHub Task Query you can see my settings belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png altGitHub task query settingsap  pAt first I was able to create two issues that also appeared on GitHub. Both issue were however placed in a folder in the Task List interface saying strongUnmatched Automatic container for repository tasks not matched by any querystrong. Weird...But since today things got even worse  all tasks I create are placed in the strongUnsubmittedstrong folder. This makes perfect sense with one exception  whenever I try to submit the task I getp  blockquote   blockquote     pSubmit failed Unexpected error Requires authentificationp   blockquote blockquote  pSo basically after two tasks I can no longer even submit anything. Upon creating a task I make sure I select the task query I have selected for my repository. Also the idea of all this task synchronization is supposed to be bidirectional right When I create a task in the strongEclipse Task Liststrong I expect that it will be displayed on the repositories strongIssues page on GitHubstrong and the other way around  when someone creates an issue on that same page it should appear in my task list. This is at least my understanding of synchronization. The task query doesnt show any issue whatsoever. Validating it returns that everything is perfectly fine. Pressing on the synchronization button even though I have enabled automatic synchronization also doesnt return any errors.p  pAm I missing something or this is one of the buggiest plugins for Eclipsep

Negative 5962 pI came across a few articles like a hrefhttpwww.brightgreen.comblog20035F025F25naming5Fjava5Fclasses5Fwithout5Fa.html relnofollowthis onea, which suggest that some words should never be used as part of a class name. When a class has one of those words in the name, it means the code should be refactored or redesigned.p  pExamplep  pstrongManagerstrongp  pReason Since almost all classes manage something and the meaning of Manager is very broad, people can put a lot of responsibilities to a Manager class while still being able to claim the class does only one thing. As a result, naming a class with Manager does not say much about what the class actually does. The article mentioned earlier, a hrefhttpwww.brightgreen.comblog20035F025F25naming5Fjava5Fclasses5Fwithout5Fa.html relnofollowNaming Java Classes Without a Manager a, showed this pointp  blockquote   pFor instance, take a class named UrlManager  you cannot tell whether it pool URLs, manipulates URLs or audits the use of them. All the name tells you is that this is not a URL, but it does somehow work with them. On the other hand, the name UrlBuilder gives a much better picture of what the class does.p blockquote  pAnother examplep  pstrongHelperstrongp  pReason A class name like ThreadHelper makes people wonder why its needed and why it cannot just be part of the Thread class. Is it actually an adapter or a decorator If so, name it that way. Is class Thread taking too much responsibility already If so, refactor and give the new class a meaningful name. Helper says nothing about what its doing or how its helping.p  pWhat are other words in a class name that would signal a need for refactoring or redesign and should be avoided Whyp  pEdit I would think those words are used a lot sincep  ul lithey generally have broad meaningsli lithey can fit in almost all contextsli lithey stop designers thinking about better designs or namesli lipeople believe its OK to use themli ul  pThe book ema hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0132350882 relnofollowClean Codeaem listed more but no reasons were givenp  blockquote   pAvoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class.p blockquote  pIt would be great if someone could provide possible reasons for them.p  blockquote   pRelated questionsp      pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions38019whatsthebestapproachtonamingclassesWhats the best approach to naming classesap blockquote

Negative 5962 pI am looking at using PayPal as a payment option for my custom shopping cart I have built. I already have a cart set up, and a checkout complete. It asks the user for their address. Once they have completed all the fields, they hit Pay with PayPal. This does not send them to PayPal yet. First it processes the data they entered, THEN redirects them off to PayPal to pay.p  pThis is all using PayPal Express Checkout.p  pThe desired flow is something like this.p  ol liThe user adds items to the cart. All this happens and is already handled by my server, with no calls to PayPal. I want the user to manage the cart on MY WEBSITE, not PayPal.li liOnce finished, the user hits checkout. This then takes them to another page on my server for example a hrefhttpmywebsite.comstorecheckout relnofollowhttpmywebsite.comstorecheckouta where they confirm their shopping cart and enter their shipping address and other details.li liOnce they finish that, they click a Pay with PayPal button and are sent to another page on MY server for example, a hrefhttpmywebsite.comstorecheckoutpay relnofollowhttpmywebsite.comstorecheckoutpaya where my web application processes the order and information and adds it to the database. Now, HERE is where I want the paypal magic to happen.li liDuring the processing of the previous page step three, I want my web application to contact paypal using the SetExpressCheckout API and redirect the user to the PayPal payment page.li liThe user enters their credit card or PayPal details and pays on a hrefhttpspaypal.com relnofollowhttpspaypal.coma.li liThe user is then sent back to my website to be told that payment has been received if it has or any other alerts that they need to be aware of. The order status is updated accordingly and the order is shipped off.li ol  pI am quite sure this is all possible. Is it I am using Python and Django.p  pMy only problem is that I do not want the users to have to enter their shippingpayment address TWICE once on my website, once on the paypal payment website. I do not want the user to have to enter their shippingpayment address at the PayPal payment website. There is no need for this as I already have it. Is it possible to remove the address fields from the PayPal website, or just prefill them with data from my websitep

Negative 5962 pIve been playing around with PHPTAL for the last couple of days. Overall I really like it. Its been much easier to get into than most others Ive looked into. I am having one particular problem, though.p  pHeres the issue. I am trying to nest two templates. Lets say InnerClass has this templatep  precodeltdivgtHello Worldltdivgt codepre  pOuterClass has the following templatep  precodeltdiv talcontentmyVargtThis text should be replaced with the HTML above.ltdivgt codepre  pInnerClass also has a method called render, which essentially calls themplates execute method and returns the content. So I do this in the outer classp  precodetemplategtmyVar  innerClassObjectgtrender codepre  pI, then, display the content of the OuterClass. The problem is that the rendered HTML of the inner class comes escaped and I see gt and lt instead of actual tags. It seems that myVar is completely escaped before its content is displayed.p  pSince this approach does not work, what is the best way to nest PHPTAL templates I assume its possible and its just lack of knowledge on my end, so any input is appreciated.p

Negative 5962 pMy problem is to compute codegx mod pcode quickly in JavaScript, where codecode is exponentiation, codemodcode is the modulo operation. All inputs are nonnegative integers, codexcode has about 256 bits, and codepcode is a prime number of 2048 bits, and codegcode may have up to 2048 bits.p  pMost of the software Ive found that can do this in JavaScript seems to use the JavaScript BigInt library a hrefhttpwww.leemon.comcryptoBigInt.htmlhttpwww.leemon.comcryptoBigInt.htmla. Doing a single exponentiation of such size with this library takes about 9 seconds on my slow browser Firefox 3.0 with SpiderMonkey. Im looking for a solution which is at least 10 times faster. The obvious idea of using squareandmultiply exponentiation by squaring, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiExponentiation5Fby5Fsquaringhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiExponentiationbysquaringa is too slow for 2048bit numbers it needs up to 4096 multiplications.p  pUpgrading the browser is not an option. Using another programming language is not an option. Sending the numbers to a web service is not an option.p  pIs there a faster alternative implementedp  pUpdate By doing some extra preparations i.e. precomputing a few hundred powers as recommended by the article a hrefhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfa mentioned in outis answer below, it is possible do to a 2048bit modular exponentiation using only at most 354 modular multiplications. The traditional squareandmultiply method is much slower it uses maximum 4096 modular multiplications. Doing so speeds up the modular exponentiation by a factor of 6 in Firefox 3.0, and by a factor of 4 in Google Chrome. The reason why we are not getting the full speedup of 4096354 is that BigInts modular exponentation algorithm is already faster than squareandmultiply, because it uses Montgomery reduction a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMontgomery5Freductionhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMontgomeryreductiona.p  pUpdate Starting from BigInts code, it seems worthwhile doing two levels of handoptimized and inlined Karatsuba multiplication a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKaratsuba5Falgorithmhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKaratsubaalgorithma, and only then revert to the base32768 On2 multiplication implemented in BigInt. This speeds up multiplications by a factor of 2.25 for 2048bit integers. Unfortunately, the modulo operation does not become faster.p  pUpdate Using the modified Barrett reduction defined in a hrefhttpwww.lirmm.frarith18papershasenplaughFastModularReduction.pdfhttpwww.lirmm.frarith18papershasenplaughFastModularReduction.pdfa and Karatsuba multiplication and precomputing powers as defined in a hrefhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfa, I can get down the time needed for a single multiplication from 73 seconds to 12.3 seconds in Firefox 3.0. This seems to be the best I can do, but it is still too slow.p  pUpdate The ActionScript 2 AS2 interpreter in the Flash Player isnt worth using, because it seems to be slower than the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox 3.0 for Flash Player 9, it seems to be 4.2 times slower, and for Flash Player 10, it seems to be 2.35 times slower. Does anybody know the speed difference between ActionScript2 and ActionScript3 AS3 for number chrunchingp  pUpdate The ActionScript 3 AS3 interpreter in Flash Player 9 isnt worth using because it has just about the same speed as the JavaScript int Firefox 3.0.p  pUpdate The ActionScript 3 AS3 interpreter in Flash Player 10 can be up to 6.5 times faster than the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox 3.0 if codeintcode is used instead of codeNumbercode, and codeVector.ltintgtcode is used instead of codeArraycode. At least it was 2.41 times faster for 2048bit big integer multiplication. So it might be worth doing the modular exponentiation in AS3, executing it in Flash Player 10 if available. Please note that this is still slower than V8, the JavaScript interpreter of Google Chrome. See a hrefhttpptspts.blogspot.com200910javascriptandactionscriptperformance.htmlhttpptspts.blogspot.com200910javascriptandactionscriptperformance.htmla for a speed comparison of various programming language and JavaScript implementations.p  pUpdate There is a very fast Java solution, which can be called from the browsers JavaScript if the Java plugin is installed. The following solution is about 310 times faster than the pure JavaScript implementation using BigInt.p  precodeltbodygthi0 ltscript typetextjavascriptgt document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgthi1 if objecttypeof java    var x  new java.math.BigInteger123456789123456789, 10   var p  new java.math.BigInteger234567891234567891, 10   var g  new java.math.BigInteger3, 10   var v  x.modPowx, p   document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgt  v.toString   document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgt  v.toString16  else    document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgtjava plugin not installed  ltscriptgtltbodygt codepre  pCan anyone translate this code to Silverlight Cp

Note that this should work for smaller values of codeEcode say, up to 50  sum of weights.

A filter is a map of codeid gt isenabledcode. If codeisenabledcode is false for a given codeidcode, that codeidcode should be excluded from the results. The codeEcode value in the above restriction is calculated only for enabled elements.

Negative 5962 pSo I have built a small application that has a physics engine and a display. The display is attached to a controller which handles the physics enginewell, actually a view model that handles the controller, but details.p  pCurrently the controller is a delegate that gets activated by a begininvoke and deactivated by a cancellation token, and then reaped by an endinvoke. Inside the lambda brushes PropertyChangedhooked into INotifyPropertyChanged which keeps the UI up to date.p  pFrom what I understand the BeginInvoke method activates a task rather than another threadwhich on my computers does activate another thread, but this isnt a guarantee from the reading I have done,its up to the thread pool how it wants to get the task completed, which is fine from all the testing I have done. The lambda doesnt complete until a CancellationToken is killed. It has a sleep and an updateso it is sort of simulating a realtime physics engine...its crude, but I dont need real precision on the real time, just enough to get a feelp  pThe question I have is, will this work on other computers, or should I switch over to explicit threads that I start and cancel The scenario I am thinking of is on a 1 core processor, is it possible the second task will get massively less processor time and thereby make my acceptably inaccurate model into something unacceptably inaccuratei.e. waiting for milliseconds before switching rather than microseconds.

Negative 5962 pIm trying to find a nice and elegant way to query database content based on DDD specifications.p  pIn domain driven design, a specification is used to check if some object, also known as the candidate, is compliant to a domain specific requirement. For example, the specification IsTaskDone goes likep  precodeclass IsTaskDone extends SpecificationltTaskgt   boolean isSatisfiedByTask candidate    return candidate.isDone    codepre  pThe above specification can be used for many purposes, e.g. it can be used to validate if a task has been completed, or to filter all completed tasks from a collection. strongHowever, I want to reuse this, nice, domain related specification to query on the database.strongp  pOf course, the easiest solution would be to retrieve all entities of our desired type from the database, and filter that list inmemory by looping and removing nonmatching entities. But clearly that would not be optimal for performance, especially when the entity count in our db increases.p  pemProposalemp  pSo my idea is to create a ConversionManager that translates my specification into a persistence technique specific criteria, think of the JPA predicate class. The services looks as followsp  precodepublic interface JpaSpecificationConversionManager   ltTgt Predicate getPredicateForSpecificationltTgt specification, RootltTgt root, CriteriaQueryltgt cq, CriteriaBuilder cb  JpaSpecificationConversionManager registerConverterJpaSpecificationConverterlt, gt converter  codepre  pBy using our manager, the users can register their own conversion logic, isolating the domain related specification from persistence specific logic. To minimize the configuration of our manager, I want to use annotations on my converter classes, allowing the manager to automatically register those converters.p  pJPA repository implementations could then use my manager, via dependency injection, to offer a find by specification method. Providing a find by specification should drastically reduce the number of methods on our repository interface.p  pIn theory, this all sounds decent, but I feel like Im missing something critical. What do you guys think of my proposal, does it comply to the DDD way of thinking Or is there already a framework that does something identical to what I just describedp

Negative 5962 pBefore you jump on me with an obvious answer, let me qualify the question and say, not all classes are sub classable. p  ul liSub classing should be a carefully thought out extra not a default property of all classes. li liIt could be argued classes should be final by default and not final if one really wants that.li ul  pI can think of many advantages for package private classes.p  ul liif the class is not really for my viewing and just a helper that i should consider a implementation detail, making it non public means it wont come up when i search for classes by name or implementations of an interface in my ide.li liit also means that if everything but the exported interfaces are public examining the api while browsing the library jar files becomes much simpler as there is less noise. I no longer see internal implementation stuff.li lithere is no need to worry about sub classes outside your package.li lifor the users the practical benefit means that methods they need are probably also going to be grouped together under one interfaceclass rather than being scattered around in other public classes which means less cluter and there are less places to look and less handles too manage.li ul  pSo why dont people take advantage of these facilities p

Negative 5962 pIve seen several questions regarding problems with generating classes from XML Schema using codexsd.execode, along with suggestions for how to preprocess the schema often using XSLT to resolve some of the trickier aspects prior to generation. My question is whether its possible to construct a C code generator that is 100 compliant with XML Schema. Are the problems with codexsd.execode merely a question of its implementation, or do they point to a fundamental inconsistency between XML Schema and Cp  pstrongIn particularstrong, Im interested in how to map concepts in XML Schema to C  what are the accepted mappings, which mappings are debatable, are there XML Schema constructs that are inherently unmappable and are there C constructs that are underutilised Is there a compliance specification that would provide rules for mapping, such that it could be implemented and testedp  pEDIT For the sake of clarity Im fully aware that XML Schema wont provide me with fully implemented C interfaces, Im interested in whether it can be fully mapped to a C class hierarchy.p  pEDIT 2 Ive added a small bounty, as Im interested in getting a bit more detail. p  pEDIT 3 Bounty still open, but so far heading toward stakx  a good answer but emmainlyem dealing with how to replicate C structures in XML Schema, rather than the other way round. Good input though.p

Negative 5962 pI am implementing custom codeUIViewControllercode subclasses that emulate behaviours of codeUITabBarControllercode and codeUINavigationControllercode.p  pI would like to make these classes general enough so that any codeUIViewControllercode can be used. One problem that I ran into is that the property codeparentViewControllercode as well as codenavigationControllercode is read only.p  pAside One motivation for setting codeparentViewControllercode is for the correct behaviour of codepresentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimatedcode. UIViewController seems to pass it onto parentViewController, if set.p  pUsing KVC method codesetValueself forKeyparentViewControllercode seems to work, but could this get my app rejected Has anyone done anything similarp

Negative 5962 pIm developing a WPF application in C and was thinking about implementing a custom UI element accross various windows.  p  pI would like to have a minimized tray only about 4px visible that expands after clicking on an icon next to the tray. The expanded version would show all controls and would minimize when I click the icon again. I created a quick HTML a hrefhttpimg14.imageshack.usimg143884conceptpu.png relnofollowconcepta to clarify things.p  pI know I could put a stackpanel and button in my application and making both of them move up when I click the button, but then I would need to duplicate the code a lot.p  pThough Im experienced with C, Im fairly new to WPF interface developmenttemplates, but Im sure there has to be a way so I can use that UI element accross my application without needing to copypaste a lot of lines of code in my form class file.p  pI hope someone can help me, or at least point me in the right direction.p
Negative 5962 pI have several grids that display data that doesnt really map to a Model, e.g. statistics, counts, etc. The values they display are dynamically generated by the server based on the currentlylogged in user, and could be related to any number of serverside models. p  pIt seems silly to set up an ExtJS Model for these situations. They might look something likep  precodeExt.define,      extend Ext.data.Model,     fields [name, count]  codepre  pIt doesnt make sense to me. I know the codefieldscode attribute of the store is still there, but the documentation states it is only really there for backwards compatibility and should be avoided. Plus, at least with the compatibility layer running, theres the console warning against using it.p  pSo what is the proper approach for these situationsp

Negative 5962 pFirstly this is more of a design  interface type question, so has no right  wrong answer, but I would appreciate peoples opinions on this.p  pI am creating a comparison site, and I am unsure how to proceed with the search interface. There are going to be lots of fields, and each field will potentially have many values. Some of these fields will condense the values by using a slider, but others will need a checkbox for each value available as multiple values may be needed.p  pWhen you change any field, it will automatically update the results below, and each fields options to show whats left to filter  search.p  pNow I had originally intended to have the top 5 search fields visible at the top of the page in columns, and limit those fields to the top 5 most frequently occurring values. Each field would have a show more to expand the options, and there would also be a show more fields button to expand the search even more.p  pWhen fully expanded, this definitely has the capability to fill a good size screen resolution. Obviously it has the option to minimise the form again, and the results will be shown underneath, but has anyone got any ideas how this can be layed outp  pWe have toyed with having all the search options in a side bar, but there are so many you would probably have to scroll down a full page height 2 or 3 times to see everything which would get annoying. Clicking the max  minimise button would definitely be easier in my opinion.p  pA few examples but in reality are not as complicated as what we need arep  pa hrefhttpwww.autotrader.co.uk relnofollowhttpwww.autotrader.co.ukap  pa hrefhttpwww.holidaylettings.co.ukhomesearch.asp relnofollowhttpwww.holidaylettings.co.ukhomesearch.aspap  pAny good examples  ideasp

Negative 5962 pSo as of two days ago, i had myself a shiny new SVN server. I set it up for WebDAV with no problems.

Negative 5962 pIs there a way to add additional build steps to the Bundle building process that is triggered when you right click and select Build Bundle from within CRXDEp  pMy specific use case right now is to be able to run the xjc compiler to generate some additional Java source classes for JAXB binding for interacting with a 3rd party web service. But the specific additional tasks could be anything really.p  pI can see that clicking the Build Bundle item triggers a POST request to libscrxdebuild that includes two parameters, one that indicates the root directory of the bundle and also the location of the bundle descriptor. This URL is serviced by the com.day.crx.ide.CRXDEBuildServlet servlet which is part of the com.day.crx.crxdesupport bundle.p  pRight now I am having to run the xjc process externally to CRXDE via Maven from the command line in this case and then push the generated .java files back into the JCR tree using vlt, then do the right click Build Bundle process.p  pI realize I could build my own OSGi bundle externally and install it to Felix, but I am looking for a way to avoid that as it makes our development environment more complex, particularly with some junior CQ folks on the team.p

Simple enough, right Enter Entity Framework 4.1... p  pOur end goal here is that the programmers I do my best to stay only on the data layer never want to have to be exposed to the concrete classes.

Negative 5962 pIve been reading Introduction to Algorithms and started to get a few ideas and questions popping up in my head. The one thats baffled me most is how you would approach designing an algorithm to schedule itemsmessages in a queue that is distributed.p  pMy thoughts have lead me to browsing Wikipedia on topics such as Sorting,Message queues,Sheduling, Distributed hashtables, to name a few.p  pstrongThe scenariostrong Say you wanted to have a system that queued messages strings or some serialized object for example. A key feature of this system is to avoid any single point of failure. The system had to be distributed across multiple nodes within some cluster and had to consistently or as best as possible even the work load of each node within the cluster to avoid hotspots.p  pYou want to avoid the use of a masterslave design for replication and scaling no single point of failure. The system totally avoids writing to disc and maintains in memory data structures. p  pSince this is meant to be a queue of some sort the system should be able to use varying scheduling algorithms FIFO,Earliest deadline,round robin etc... to determine which message should be returned on the next request regardless of which node in the cluster the request is made to.p  pstrongMy initial thoughtsstrong I can imagine how this would work on a single machine but when I start thinking about how youd distribute something like this questions likep  pHow would I hash each messagep  pHow would I know which node a message was sent top  pHow would I schedule each item so that I can determine which message and from which node should be returned nextp  pI started reading about distributed hash tables and how projects like Apache Cassandra use some sort of consistent hashing to distribute data but then I thought, since the query wont supply a key I need to know where the next item is and just supply it... This lead into reading about peer to peer protocols and how they approach the synchronization problem across nodes.p  pSo my question is, how would you approach a problem like the one described above, or is this too far fetched and is simply a stupid idea... p  pJust an overview, pointers,different approaches, pitfalls and benefits of each. The technologiesconceptsdesigntheory that may be appropriate. Basically anything that could be of use in understanding how something like this may work.p  pAnd if youre wondering, no Im not intending to implement anything like this, its just popped into my head while reading It happens, I get distracted by wild ideas when I read a good book.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAnother interesting point that would become an issue is a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgcassandraDistributedDeletes relnofollowdistributed deletesa.I know systems like Cassandra have tackled this by implementing a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgcassandraHintedHandoff relnofollowHintedHandoffa,a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgcassandraReadRepair relnofollowRead Repaira and a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgcassandraAntiEntropy relnofollowAntiEntropya and it seems to work work well but are there any other viable and efficient means of tackling thisp

Negative 5962 pWe are currently working on a clientserver game in java. We used codeDatagramSocketcode to perform communications between client and server.

Negative 5962 pI have run into an interesting problem. I have inherited a database for daemon process that polls and accepts reports from remote embedded systems. Each site that has one of these systems can monitor over a dozen different fuel tanks. In practice, most monitor 2, 3 or 4 tanks.p  pWhen something happens, such as a tank being refilled or a tank reaching a minimum level, the program saved that event in a Postgres database. The way the database was originally constructed, it was saving all the information from each fuel tank type of fuel, etc. in the event record, even though there was a separate tanks table. I added a foreign key field to the table to associate it with a particular embedded unit, and a foreign key to the events table to associate it with a particular tank.p  pNow heres the problem tanks can be added, removed, or have the type of fuel they store changed at any time. Adding tanks shouldnt be a problem, but if one is removed, those event recorded would be orphaned. Worse if the type of fuel is changed, from say jet to rocket, then when someone searches through the history, they would think all those old events happened to the rocket fuel, when in fact they happened to the jet fuel.p  pI have received a couple of suggestions offline 1 make a second, archive table of the tanks, and when anything changes, move that tank record, with its unique ID, to the archive table, and make a new record with new ID for the new state of the tank, or 2 and an active field to the tanks table, and still create new rows when specs change, but only flag the current state of the tanks as active.p  pDoes anyone have any opinion on these proposed solutions, or another idea that might workp

Negative 5962 pI am trying to figure out if a latitudelongitude point is contained within a polygon defined by vertexes that represent points on the earth also latlons, in clockwise order.

Negative 5962 pBit of advice really, i am building an MVC application that takes in feeds for products from multiple sources.  This can run into millions and despite my best advice for the client to split all his feeds into smaller chunks, I know they will probably try and do a thousand at a go.p  pNow the main problem is that I dont want to loop through every xml record and do an insert. what i would rather do is queue a stack off inserts and then fly them into the database in one massive transaction.  Very much like a database SQL import of a whole table.p  pIs this possible   if so how or what do they call itp  palso, if I did want to reinsert repeated products again and again, when nothing has changed, what would be the best practice for this.   could I maybe loop through an already fetched datasetp  pIm not sure what is best to do here, so ask the people,  what is the consensus when it comes to a scenario like this.p  pthanksp

Negative 5962 pWhat I need to do is, in my mind, incredibly simple. So simple in fact that it is probably obvious and therefore I cannot seem to find any place that documents how to do this. p  pWhat I need is just to take the value of a Date Picker page Item P1DATE1 and through a dynamic action set the value of a second Date Picker page Item P1DATE2. The value of P1DATE2 should be 2 years, or 730 days, greater than the value of P1DATE1. So all I need is a simple 730 expression rightp  pI had this working using sysdate as the start date for this calculation. The below PLSQL expression gave the appropriate outputp  precode    tocharsysdate  730,ddMONrr  codepre  pBut then I could not get it to translate to accepting the value of the page item.

Negative 5962 h2Motivationh2  pI want to be able to build up a treelike object hierarchy in Javascript that corresponds to the ASP.NET MVC 3 Razor views on a page. The plan is to have a onetoone correspondence between a Razor view and a Javascript file where its logic is defined in form of a constructor function that will accept some initialization parameters. Simple example could look like this p  ul licodeLayout.cshtml ltgt Global.jscode ul licodeSplitterPane.cshtml ltgt SplitterPane.jscode ul licodeGrid.cshtml ltgt Grid.jscodeli licodeTree.cshtml ltgt Tree.jscodeli ulli ulli ul  pI would use the constructors to build a hierarchy, e.g.p  precodevar page  new Globalglobaloptions var splitter  new SplitterPanesplitteroptions var grid  new Gridgridoptions var tree  new Treetreeoptions  page.addChildsplitter splitter.addChildgrid splitter.addChildtree codepre  pAll of this code should be of course constructed automatically in the context of the root layout view from metadata collected from the partial views. Metadata provided by a view contains the options necessary to initialize its Javascript object and the Javascript files to load.p  h2Problemh2  pUnlike WebForms, MVC views do not have any natural hierarchy I would know of and passing information between a view and its partial subviews seems rather tricky. In case of using helpers like codeHtml.Actioncode in the view the whole processing of a subview happens independently, so they dont even share the codePagecode object. What I need is some kind of a central place where the views can deposit their metadata as they are rendered so that it can be used in the layout view to combine and output the complete script.p  h2Solution h2  pOne way I could think of was to use the codeHttpContext.Current.Itemscode to temporarily store a collection of view metadata objects. All the views would deposit the metadata there and layout view would use it. The order of execution seems to match my expectation, however Im still unable to reconstruct the tree hierarchy of views. To be able to do that, I would need to use a stack where a view would register on start of its rendering and unregister on the end, so that the parent can be found on the top. p  ol liIs there a way to have some prepostrender hooks where I could put this logic li liIs this even a good idea in the first place li liIs there a completely different solution that I dont see  li ol

Negative 5962 pWhat I would like to do is create a map after an element is clicked on.  Im using Google Maps v3.p  pI have a Realty listing page that shows 15 resultsproperties per page.  Instead of generating 15 maps I would like 1 map to be created when I click on an element.  Once clicked on, the map generation process takes place.  The map canvasdiv is initially hidden.p  pI was thinking that the click element and map element relationship would be something like thisp  precodeltspan id121234 lat10.101010 lng25.252525 classviewmapgtView Mapltspangt ... other markup ... ltdiv id121234map classgooglemapgtltdivgt codepre  pUsing HTML5 I add custom attributes to the element about the property like emidem, emlatitudeem and emlongitudeem so I can change the icon and center the map.p  pIve got a functioning map from which I load markers from a dynamically generated XML file based on the search parameters.p  pIve been looking at addListener and addDomListener but havent had any luck.

Negative 5962 pI am writing a small game engine for XNA. Right now my entity manager has a list of all entities it can update and render. Lets say, however, that I want to split this list up into sub lists. Maybe some entities do not require rendering, and so we would like to separate the rendering entities from the nonrendering entities, while maintaining another list which shows ALL entities for updating. So thats 3 lists. p  pIs there a way to maintain consistency between lists easily To ensure that the exact same objects are being referenced in both lists Not a copy of the object. In C wed just have an array of pointers to entities that render, and another for entities that dont.p  pThe problem isnt really putting entities into these lists, its disposing them thats throwing me off. To destroy an entity, i simply set a dispose bool to true in that entity. The entity manger, when looping through all entities, removes the reference to that entity if dispose is set to true, and the garbage cleaner destroys the entity because there is no more references left to it. Would i have to manually go through each and every list that has something to do with Entities and remove that entity from those lists to keep things consistent p  panother example of this problem is with quad trees. I have a 2d game and i generate a quad tree for all the entities. The entities that lie in between 2 grid locations are in 2 branches of the tree. how would i remove it from the tree search the entire tree for references to that entity seems a little pointless to have a quad tree if thats the case..p
Negative 5962 pI understand that content, presentation, and behavior are supposed to be separated by using HTML, CSS, and JS to implement them independently.  Is there a best practice for binding these elements concretely while maintaining loose coupling in a dynamic web app  Is it even possible  Optimally without depending on jQueryp  pTo clarify what Im talking about HTML has no mechanism for the definition of new tags, so when your JavaScript model needs to generate content, the tags and structure for its presentation are necessarily defined in JS or somehow made accessible to it, tightly coupling behavior to content.p  pBefore someone calls overOOP, the reason I want to keep tags and CSS classes out of JS is that I dont even want to commit to HTML as a front end.  There are at least five different representations of my underlying model that Ill eventually want, and tightly coupling the model to HTML rules out at least two of them.p  pIs there some way to late bind the model to the target representation without sacrificing dynamics or loose coupling  Like an XML document corresponding model elements to template HTML snippetsp  pUPDATEp  pThough it seems backward to provide concrete details of a question about factoring and OO best practice, I want to provide a much fresher example of the entanglement of form amp function inherent to HTML.  The entanglement of content amp behavior between HTML and JS is the problem, though, not the example, and I want an answer that doesnt break when I change the details.  Its from a very different project than the one I was working when I first asked this question, but the gist is the samep  ul lipI have some HTML for a UI widget.  It is a view that represents a model object  a selection of palettes  to the user.  Palettes themselves are part of the apps task, so theyre not view, theyre model.pli lipI want to use this widget in at least 2 different dialogs and any I might want in the future.  In one, I need a changed selection to cause immediate action, the recoloring of a set of images in canvas elements that are part of the same dialog.  In another, I just need to have two different sets to select from  one selection in each set.pli lipI do not want to copy and paste this widgets HTML form or JS behavior because I want maintenance and revision to propagate from one base thing to all of its instances.  Thus, only one instance of the widget, whatever its form may be, may exist in my source.pli lipI do not want to have my JS rendering HTML tags directly because doing so will forfeit my IDEs error checking and content assistance on the HTML.  Further, if there are problems with the HTML output, their source in my JS will be less clear because the process of generating the HTML doesnt look like HTML or necessarily reflect its structure.  Finally, I want to test the effects of changes to the widgets CSS and HTML independently of my JS.pli lipI do not want to involve additional dependencies e.g. separate templating amp parameterization languages in my source because changes to various standards or evolving needs may break their compatibility, or they may themselves become unmaintained, in the future, leaving me with a massive quantity of useless source.  Depending on jQuery is okay because it does more for normalizing between browsers not to mention for convenience than it is likely to ever break given its ubiquity, but other libraries will be regarded with extreme suspicion.pli lipI want to specify the details of altering and retrieving the widgets state what colors compose the palettes, how the user chooses among them in JS that references only the widget and its component parts, since its going to be a part of multiple dialogs that use its information in different ways.pli lipSimultaneously, other JS code the dialogs behavior needs to be able to observe and initialize the widgets state  but without including any specific references to the widgets internal structure, which may some day change to accommodate new features, fix bugs, etc.pli ul  pFor simply making multiple copies of the widgets HTML, I can settle on calling codejquery.clonecode on a template node that exists in an HTML file, and inserting the contents where I need them, from the function that sets up the dialog.  HTML makes things difficult when any of the cloned elements have codeidcode or codenamecode attributes, but careful handling during cloning can make unique identifiers, point their corresponding codelabelcode elements and codehrefcode attributes at the new identifiers, and keep the old ones accessible in data attributes.  So all is well and good for structure amp content, and obviously the CSS presentation propagates to the clone just fine.p  pThe rub comes when I try to implement the widgets interface with its dialogs controller.  What is the most futureproof way to expose the widgets states abstraction  I.e. I dont want to use codewidgetJquery.findinputchecked.valcode to get the selected color from code that doesnt absolutely have to commit to a selection being based on a checked input element whose value attribute is a set of serialized colors.p  pI hope that makes it more clear what Im looking for without muddling the question with details.p

Negative 5962 pMy problem is, that search is a small addition to my Application and I dont really want to invest that much time into digging into the whole idea. Looking at my search results  its a very common pattern that I get some very good matches 7 and some very very bad matches, witch score like 0.10. If I would like to sort the results using any other criteria than score, it will make very little sense, as the 0.10 have almost nothing to do with the query and might end up first on the list. p  pSeriously, it looks like cutting everything below score of around 3 will make my results way more consistent and sorting will make much more sense. p  pNow, after doing some basic research, it looks like lots of people think, that filtering Solr results by score is really bad idea. There are some hits on how to do this, but I couldnt find a working solution yet.p  pThe suggested ideas with using frange on both the proper q query or qf doesnt really work. Ditching the low score results in the App itself seems pretty dull as well, since it will break pagination, slow things down and in general yield in a lot of unnecessary work. p  pAfter roughly na hour on the Google I found out that a lot of people really want this solution, though I couldnt find anything which works for me.p  pSo, is there any way at all to ditch low score results on the solr side Are there any custom Filters to do that p  pEditp  pVast of the results have a significant score gap at the bottom for some reason. For example the last relevant result get say 4.5 score and there is a always few more results with next highest one at 0.12... Maybe I am doing something wrong on the index level Is there any simple way to push those irrelevant results down off the result hash After some more research looks like that I would be more less ok after just ditching the lt 1 scores...p

Negative 5962 pI am creating an application where when a tab is clicked its content is loaded via ajax.  The reason for this is to speed up the initial page load, and not to load unnecessary tab content.  The tabs contain form items, where values can be changed.  p  pTo prevent the data from being lost, When a tab is loaded I am giving it an extra class of ajaxed.   When the tabs are clicked if the class ajaxed does not exist, then the content is loaded via ajax, otherwise the content previously loaded is simply presented to the user.p  pQuesiton Does caching lots of HTML in the dom slow down performance Is this bad practice   This applies to infinite scroll and other types of pages where you simply keep appending more and more html.  What are the drawbacks of this approachp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5962 pIve found several topics with a similar issue but the contents seemed slightly different and I have not been able to solve my problem as a result.p  pIn my application I have DataTable that contains 4 columnsp  ul liUInt16li liUInt64li liUInt64li liA self defined enumeration type consisting of 2 values.li ul  pIn order to display the values of this DataTable I created a DataGridView and set this table as the datasource. So far so good. I wanted the enumeration field column to contain comboboxes instead and ran into the DataGridViewComboBoxColumn type. I had some issues getting it to work but eventualy ended up using the following approachp  precode Create the 4 datarows   Add the datarows to the data table   Set the data table as the data source for the data grid view   Remove the column that represents the enumeration   Add a DataGridViewComboBoxColumn to the DataGridView as replacement codepre  pI have created the DataGridViewComboBoxColumn as followsp  precodeDataGridViewComboBoxColumn cb  new DataGridViewComboBoxColumn cb.HeaderText    My header text cb.ValueType     typeofMyEnumType cb.DataSource    Enum.GetValuestypeofMyEnumType cb.FlatStyle     FlatStyle.System cb.Name          Name Same name as the DataColumn and the now deleted DataGridViewColumn cb.DataPropertyName  Name Same name as the DataColumn and the now deleted DataGridViewColumn cb.DisplayStyle      DataGridViewComboBoxDisplayStyle.Nothing  dataGridView.Columns.Addcb codepre  pOnce my application starts I read in data from a text file that get placed into a structure with fields of the 4 datatypes mentioned above. I then add these fields to the DataTable as followsp  precodeDataRow row  dataTable.NewRow row[Name of the UInt16 column]     mystruct.theUInt16 row[Name of the UInt64 column]     mystruct.theUInt64 row[Name of the UInt64 column]     mystruct.theUInt642 row[Name of the enum column]       mystruct.theEnumValue                dataTable.Rows.Addrow codepre  pon startup the DataError event gets called repeatedly. The contents of the cells do get filled properly however. I see this after clicking away the error a couple of times Disabling the DataError event assigning an empty handler for example is something I prefer to not do.p  pI think there is some sort of type mismatch somehow. maybe the enum type and a string for display This is however only a guess. The dataTable column and the datagridview column both have the type set to the enumeration.p  pI hope someone can point me in the right direction. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5962 pI have a set of classes similar to the ones in the example below. However, I would like to allow the user to derive from them without modifying the base classes with additional virtual methods. Is there a way of modifying the code without having to declare virtual int GetTvoidreturn 0 in class A  I do not want to use templates, as it will yield a very ugly solution. p  precodeclass A      public     int a     Aintamp ca aca     virtual int GetTvoidreturn 0   class B     public     boostptrvectorltAgt Trajectory     void PushBackStatePointintamp ca   void BPushBackStatePointintamp ca      Trajectory.pushbacknew Aca   class Aext public A      public     int t     Aextintamp ca, intamp ct  Aca tct     virtual int GetTvoid return t   class Bext public B      public     void PushBackStatePointintamp ca, int ampct     int GetFirstElementvoidreturn Trajectory[0].GetT   void BextPushBackStatePointintamp ca, int ampct      Trajectory.pushbacknew Aextca,ct     int main          Bext MyB     int a5     int t3     MyB.PushBackStatePointa,t     stdcout ltlt MyB.GetFirstElement  codepre  pEDIT The idea is that user can extend both A and B or Aext and Bext classes with their own methods, of which the upper layers do not have to know about. So, what I am really looking for is some kind of casting method to cast a pointer to base class to a pointer of a derived class. However, I have never done this before and my first attempt failed miserably. So, the question is really can I use some kind of dynamiccastTrajectory[i] if Trajectory[i] contains a pointer to derived class, i.e. Aext.p  pAlso, the code I provided is a quick example, so please disregard everything that is wrong with it that is not related to the problemp
Negative 5962 pI have a large table with 9 columns and 12 million rows, like thisp  precodecol1  col2  col3  col4  col5  col6  col7  col8  col9 12.3  37.4  7771  675  23   23.8  78.8  892  67.5 79.3  6.3  6061  555  24   28.1  77.1  889  32.6 55.6  7.3  8888  921  56   78.3  22.3  443  22.9 ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  .... codepre  pCurrently the table is saved as TSV tabseparated vector format in my hard disk, 432MB in size. I want to populate the table into Redis in order to complete this kind of query most efficiently Given a min value and a max value for each column, count the number of rows that are within the given range, i.e.p  precodemincol1 lt col1 lt maxcol1 ampamp mincol2 lt col2 lt maxcol2 ampamp mincol3 lt col3 lt maxcol3 ampamp mincol4 lt col4 lt maxcol4 ampamp mincol5 lt col5 lt maxcol5 ampamp mincol6 lt col6 lt maxcol6 ampamp mincol7 lt col7 lt maxcol7 ampamp mincol8 lt col8 lt maxcol8 ampamp mincol9 lt col9 lt maxcol9 codepre  pSo my questions arep  p1 How to populate the table into Redis What kind of keyvalue data structure should I use Hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, or what elsep  p2 After populating the table, given 9 min and max values for the 9 columns, how to write the query in order to get the count, i.e. number of rows falling within the 9 ranges One way I can think of is, first find out the rows that satisfy mincolX lt colX lt maxcolX for each X in 1 to 9, and then calculate their intersection. But I guess this is not the most efficient way. I just want to retrieve the count as fast as possible.p  pBy the way, I have tried MongoDB. It is straightforward to populate the table using mongoimport, but it takes 10 seconds to complete my query, which is too slow and not acceptable for my realtime application. In contrast, Redis holds data in memory, so I hope Redis can shorten the query time to 1 second.p  pFor your reference, this is what I did in MongoDB.p  precodemongoimport u myusername p mypassword d mydb c mycoll type tsv file mytable.tsv headerline use mydb db.mycoll.ensureIndexcol11, col21, col31, col41, col51, col61, col71, col81, col91 . db.mycoll.count col1 gte mincol1, lte maxcol1, col2 gte mincol2, lte maxcol2, col3 gte mincol3, lte maxcol3, col4 gte mincol4, lte maxcol4, col5 gte mincol5, lte maxcol5, col6 gte mincol6, lte maxcol6, col7 gte mincol7, lte maxcol7, col8 gte mincol8, lte maxcol8, col9 gte mincol9, lte maxcol9 . codepre  pI used explain to make sure the Btree index was actually used rather than a table scan.p  pI also tried creating a ram disk and saving the my MongoDB database into the ram disk, it shortened the query time from 10s to 9s, far from acceptable for my realtime application.p  precodemkdir ram chmod R 755 ram mount t tmpfs none ram o size8192m mongod dbpath ram noprealloc smallfiles codepre

Negative 5962 pHow do I inject state into a viewcontroller that is shown as a child of a UITabBarController  I have two sibling tabs that are both showing information for a selected day.  Its possible to change what day is selected in either the TextView tab or the GraphView tab, and I want both tabs to keep in sync so I dont confuse the user.p  pOne reasonably simple way would be to declare a global state variable to hold currentDate, and have each tab viewcontroller check currentDate in viewWillAppear.p  pBut all the advice says not to do globals or equivalents, like shared singletons or properties on the application delegate, whatever.  Instead youre supposed to do dependency injection so that each controller gets a reference to the shared state object.  But whenhow do you do this  UITabBarController normally doesnt load its tab views until the user requests to see them. I dont think I want to preload everything in applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions, slowing down application launch.   But UITabBarController doesnt seem to provide any kind of tabWillAppear event to hook into, so I seem to be stuck with keeping currentDate in a global.p  pAm I missing something  Thanks.p
Negative 5962 pOK, so here is the situation. Ive got a codeFlexCollectionltTgtcode class, which purpose is to hold a list of some specialization of codeFlexItemcode, thereforep  precodepublic class FlexCollectionltTgt where T  FlexItem, new      public void AddT item  ...      ...  codepre  pcodeFlexItemcode is not generic class itself. What I wanted to achieve is ability to hold in codeFlexItemcodes field a reference to the collection that contains the object. Unfortunately in C it is not possible to hold reference to any specialization of template class as in Java. At first I tried to use nongeneric interface codeIFlexCollectioncode but it actually forced me to implement each method twice, i.e.p  precodepublic class FlexCollectionltTgt  IFlexCollection where T  FlexItem, new      public void AddT item  ...   to use in generic calls     public void Addobject item  ...   to use for calls from within FlexItem     ...  codepre  pThen I had found out that I could make FlexItem a generic class itself Then a specialization can hold a reference to collection of objects of this specialization which is quite logical. Thereforep  precodepublic class FlexItemltTgt where T  FlexItemltTgt, new      public FlexCollectionltTgt ReferenceToParentCollection     ...   public class FlexCollectionltTgt where T  FlexItemltTgt, new      public void AddT item  ...       ...  codepre  pNow i can declare some codeFlexItemltTgtcode specialization and corresponding collectionp  precodepublic class BasicItem  FlexItemltBasicItemgt  public int A  public class BasicCollection  FlexCollectionltBasicItemgt   codepre  pThe problem arises when I try to extend those classes to hold additional fields. I.e. I wanted an codeExtendedItemcode class which holds field codeBcode in addition to field codeAcodep  precodepublic class ExtendedItem  BasicItem  public int B  public class ExtendedCollection  FlexCollectionltExtendedItemgt   codepre  pAnd the thing is that codeExtendedItemcode is a subclass of codeFlexItemltBasicItemgtcode and not codeFlexItemltExtendedItemgtcode. Therefore is is impossible to declare codeExtendedCollectioncode as above. This causes a compilation errorp  precodeThe type Demo.ExtendedItem must be convertible to Demo.FlexItemltDemo.ExtendedItemgt in order to use it as parameter T in the generic type or method Demo.BasicCollectionltTgt codepre  pIs there any way to avoid such type collisionp

Negative 5962 pI have used the media only screen in my CSS to determine how and what information should be shown depending on the users screen size.

Negative 5962 pI wonder if there is any graphics library that supports RGB subpixel rendering like ClearType for general graphics, emnot just for textem. This would allow one to practically triple the horizontal resolution, and put graphics on thirdpixel x positions.p  pWhile I think this would be very useful, I couldnt find much on the internet about it, except the followingp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.grc.comctctwhat.htmHow SubPixel Font Rendering Worksa there are some line images around the middleli lia hrefhttpentropymine.comimageworsenersubpixelSubpixel rendering and image resizinga some interesting thoughts on applying subpixel rendering to resizing bitmapsli ul  pIs there any library that implements this, or are there efforts to bring something like this to the Cairo library, for examplep  hr  pUpdatep  pIm referring specifically to rendering techniques that take into account that current LCD screens use subpixels of different colors. To make a white point, you set all subpixels to on or 255. A white line would be several subpixels on top of each otherp  precode...RGB... ...RGB... ...RGB... ...RGB... ...RGB... ...111... codepre  pwhere code.code is a fully black subpixel, and codeRcode, codeGcode or codeBcode are fullylit red, green, or blue subpixels. Because our eyes cant resolve the subpixels, they blend together to make a white line. I could however also make a white line from the followingp  precode....GBR.. ....GBR.. ....GBR.. ....GBR.. ....GBR.. ....111.. codepre  pNote that it is perfectly sharp, but positioned at x  1 13 pixels. This is not possible with traditional rendering techniques that draw a slightly blurry white line instead. Here for example codeRcode70 lit, codercode30 lit. I didnt work out the math, this is just so you get the ideap  precode...RGBrgb... ...RGBrgb... ...RGBrgb... ...RGBrgb... ...RGBrgb... ...777333... codepre  pAnother example is a slope, which you can do a with full pixels, b antialiased, or c with subpixel renderingp  precodea  RGB......  b  RGB......  c  RGB......     RGB......      RGBrgb...      .GBR.....     ...RGB...      rgbRGB...      ..BRG....     ...RGB...      ...RGB...      ...RGB...     ...RGB...      ...RGBrgb      ....GBR..     ......RGB      ...rgbRGB      .....BRG.     ......RGB      ......RGB      ......RGB codepre  pAgain, note that this is just a crude example to give you the general idea, but you see that a is jaggy or aliased, b is blurry, and c is as sharp as you can get it on a LCD.p  pReal implementations of this, for font display ClearType on Windows and the subpixel rendering in FreeType have a more sophisticated algorithm. They take into account that individual subpixels bleed or shine into each other, they preserve the total color intensity or energy. They also take into account that the subpixel spacing is not even the spacing between R and G, or G and B in the pixel may be smaller than between B and R, and finally that some displays have entirely different pixel layouts.p

Negative 5962 pIm rewriting a small server backend in Sinatra, and currently the client talks to it via cURL calls such as codeecho foo  curl X PUT T  httplocalhost8090code. The problem is, in my codeputcode method in Sinatra, the coderequest.body.readcode is always empty, even after I call coderewindcode on it. Furthermore, the codeparamscode hash is completely empty.p  pWhats weird is that if I do codecurl X PUT d foo httplocalhost8090code instead it works. Also, in node.js I can read it fine using the coderequest.ondatacode and coderequest.onendcode functions.p  pIs there any way to read the codePUTcode body in Sinatra I would like to avoid changing the client code if at all possible.p

Negative 5962 pI primarily work these days with Python 2.7 and Django 1.3.3 hosted on Heroku and I have multiple projects that I maintain.  Ive been working on a Desktop with Ubuntu running inside of a VirtualBox, but recently had to take a trip and wanted to get everything loaded up on my notebook.  But, what I quickly discovered was that virtualenv  Github is really easy for creating projects, but I struggled to try and get them moved over to my notebook.  The approach that I sort of came up with was to create new virtualenv and then clone the code from github.  But, I couldnt do it in the folder that I really wanted because it would say the folder is not empty.  So, I would clone it to a tmp folder than them cutpaste the everthing into where I really wanted it.  Not TERRIBLE, but I just feel like Im missing something here and that it should be easier.  Maybe clone first, then mkvirtualenv  p  pIts not a crushing problem, but Im thinking about making some more changes like getting ride of the VirtualBox and just going with a Dual boot system and it would be great if I could make it a bit smoother.  p  pFinally, I found an read a few posts about moving git repos between computers, but I didnt see any dealing with Virtualenv maybe I just missed it.  p  pEDIT  Just to be clear and avoid confusion, Im not try to move the virtualenv.  Im just talking about best way to create a new one.  Install the packages, and then clone the repo from github.p

Many thanks for helpp  pEDIT  just a note, the max value of F could be 1... I was trying to cheat i.e. by adding or even multiplying everything by something like 101fraction1fraction2fraction3, but then I was ending up with almost equal fractions 0.33, what has no sense at all, cause other parameters are screwed... When I was fitting the same data using Origin with same model  constrains it works perfectly... When I used fixed Origin output fraction parameters fits were also great, but... its not the way to do that having dozen of fits to do   p

Negative 5962 pI am using the HTML5 multiplefile attribute to allow users to upload multiple images at a time. It works great, except with large images. I know how to change the MAXFILESIZE value in my html. I changed it to 5000000. Now, the photos from my iPhone are large, anywhere from 2.0 MB5.0 MB. When I try to do multiple of these large images, it doesnt work. Now, with multiple smaller size images, it works fine. I know its not the MAXFILESIZE associated with my form because these large images will upload individually. So, my question is, is there a Limit to the total size of the FILES being uploaded at one time If so, how do I change it Is it PHP or HTMLp  pAlso, can I resize these photos on upload, so they arent so bigp  pThanksp

Negative 5962 pI have two web applications, both to be hosted on Heroku. One is the frontend app, in the sense that all consumer facing actions will be through this app. New signups, etc. The other is the backend, this ones deals with all of the processing of new customers, their orders, and associated businesslogic. I need these apps to talk to eachother and pass data between them. Id rather not write an api on the BE app, as only the FE app would be consuming it, and this would mean Id need to spend time writing security rules and restrictions to prevent others from accessing it. p  pMy question is whether I can use a shared messaging queue between them instead, and whether  this was a good idea, and something thats possible on Heroku Does an addonservice exist for this usecase Most of the queuing addons listed have the workers and task creators in the same app.p  pIve been looking at Sidekiq as a possibility, as the BE app will need a queue for other tasks anyway, and this seems like a good candidate, but Im not sure that even if I provide a shared Redis instance between the apps, Sidekiq has the capability to pass messages between them. Anyone knowp

Negative 5962 pI was digging a lot in the internet about the best way which I can implement ActionBarSherlock in my application so I can stick around with the new Android UI. Ive changed my apps whole logic to use FragmentActivitys with nested Fragments, but I need to use TabHost at bottom of my app too. The Launcher activity of my app is extending codeTabActivitycode which is deprecated I know, but for now thats the best option for me...and dont forget that not everything depends on my choice when its about building an app and how it should look like. So I found a way how to integrate the Fragments in my app and I find a nice example how to use ABS with Tabs and Fragments on that link  a hrefhttpsgithub.comJakeWhartonActionBarSherlockblobmastersamplesfragmentssrccomactionbarsherlocksamplefragmentsFragmentTabs.java relnofollowFragmentTabsa. p  pBut the problem which I am facing in this implementation is that I want to set codeFragmentActivitycode as content of the different tabs, not codeFragmentcode, but I couldnt figure it out how to do this. So any kind of help or suggestions or advices or even example are really welcomedp

Negative 5962 pI have a doubt related to transactions within transactions. For background, I have a School entity object which has Set of Students entity object mapped to it. I am using Spring Data JPA which is taking care of all the crud operations. I have a SchoolManagementService class which has Transactionalreadonlytrue set at the class level and for all updating methods I am using Transactional over them. In my SchoolManagementService class I have a method deleteStudentsList which I have marked as Transactional. In this method I am calling StudentsRepository.deletestudentId again and again. I want to make sure if any delete fails then the transaction should rollback for that checked exception.

Negative 5962 pI have about 50k entries that I am inserting in MySQL via PHP. Table is simple with ID autoincrementation, and few VARCHAR fields...p  pSince this system allows multiple users to login at same time and do the same operation of inserting data, so lets say USER1 starts the insert and in very same millisecond USER2 starts inserting data in same table  I am curious if MySQL will wait for USER1 to finish process and than process USER2 entries or it will do insert simultaneously  p  pSo following that logic USER1 insert IDs will be from 1 to 50k and USER2 from 50k100k, or at the other hand will it shuffle themp  p...and if it will do shuffling is there a way to prevent this p  pP.S. I know  I can add additional field with userid so I can distinguish which user did actual entry, but in this case I would really like to reserve space from 150k to be for USER1 and 50k100k to be for USER2....p

Negative 5962   pBy my understanding, codestrcmpcode no n, upon seeing a null character in either argument, immediately stops processing and returns a result.br Therefore, if one of the arguments is known with 100 certainty to be nullterminated e.g. it is a string literal, there is no security benefit whatsoever in using codestrncmpcode with n with a call to codestrlencode as part of the third argument to limit the comparison to the known string length, because codestrcmpcode will already never read more characters than are in that knownterminating string.p  pIn fact, it seems to me that a call to codestrncmpcode whose length argument is a codestrlencode on one of the first two arguments is only different from the codestrcmpcode case in that it wastes time linear in the size of the knownterminating string by evaluating the codestrlencode expression.p  pConsiderp  pstrongSample code Astrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeif strcmpuserinput, status  0     replywithstatus codepre  pstrongSample code Bstrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeif strncmpuserinput, status, strlenstatus1  0     replywithstatus codepre  pIs there any benefit to the former over the latter Because I see it in other peoples code a emlotem.p  pDo I have a flawed understanding of how these functions workp

Negative 5962 pI am trying to define some dependency injection guidelines for myself. What should be the right granularity while defining dependencies for a class that are to be injected either via constructor or setter injection The class could be a service, repository, etc. Suppose there is a repository class, which looks like followingp  precodepublic class ProductRepository       OptionA     public ProductRepositoryDataSource dataSource                OptionB           public ProductRepositorySqlSession sqlSession                OptionC     public ProductRepositorySqlSessionTemplate sqlSessionTemplate            codepre  pThe minimum dependency required by the above class is DataSource interface. The repository class internally makes use of the SqlSessionTemplate implementation of the SqlSession interface. As shown in the code, there are 3 choices for constructor for doing constructor injection. The following is my understandingp  pstrongOptionA DataSource dependencystrong This is the minimum dependency of the repository class. From consumer point of view this constructor is the right choice but it is not suitable from unit testing point of view because DataSource is internally consumed by the SqlSessionTemplate in the repository implementation.p  pstrongOptionsB SqlSession dependencystrong This is the right choice from unit testing point of view but not from the consumer point of view. Additionally the repository implementation is tightly coupled with specific implementation of the interface which is SqlSessionTemplate. Hence it will not work if the consumer passes some different SqlSession interface other than SqlSessionTemplate.p  pstrongOptionsC SqlSessionTemplate dependencystrong SqlSessionTemplate being an implementation and not an interface does not seem to be good for unit testing. Also, it is not good for the consumer as instantiating SqlSessionTemplate is more involved as compared to DataSource. Hence discarding this option.p  pOptionA and OptionB seems to be the available choices. But, there is a tradeoff between consumer point of view and unit testing point of view and vice versa.p  pI am new to dependency injection. I seek advice from the DI experts. What is the right solution if any What would you do in the above situationp  pThanks.p

It has a message Completing the RailsInstaller setup wizard... Setup has finished installing Railsinstaller on your computer. Clicking on Finish, Back, anything does absolutely nothing the window just sits there. Clearly something is not working, and Im not sure what to do. I checked the Rails install in the terminal and got the following messagep  blockquote   p rails help   SystemLibraryFrameworksRuby.frameworkVersions1.8usrlibruby1.8rubygems.rb827in codereportactivateerror Could not find RubyGem rails gt 0 GemLoadError       from SystemLibraryFrameworksRuby.frameworkVersions1.8usrlibruby1.8rubygems.rb261incodeactivate       from SystemLibraryFrameworksRuby.frameworkVersions1.8usrlibruby1.8rubygems.rb68in gem       from usrbinrails18p blockquote  pIm hesitant to start killing processes or restart my machine. Also wondering if Im going to have to purge everything Ive already installed and start over from scratch, and not sure how I would go about that. p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 5962 pWow, it was hard to encapsulate my issue here into a succinct headline. I hope I managed.p  pIve got a simple thumbnail feature that is causing me issues when I try to retrieve a URL from Amazon S3, then codeconvertcode it using ImageMagick. I would normally use PIL to read in an image file and convert it, but PIL doesnt read in PDF formats, so Im resorting to convert through a subprocess call. p  pHeres some code from a django views.py. The idea here is that I get a file url from S3, open it with codeconvertcode, process it into a PNG, send it to stdout, and then use the outputted buffer to load up a StringIO object, which then gets passed back to defaultstorages to save the thumbnail file back to S3. Quite a faff for such a simple job, but there you go.p  pstrongPlease note I cannot reliably save a file to disk using codeconvertcode on my production setup with Heroku, otherwise, Id be doing that already.strongp  precodedef largethumbnails3p       get the URL from S3, trimming off the expiry info etc. So far so good.      url  defaultstorage.urlp.pdf.split     url  url[0]       this opens the PDF file fine, and proceeds to convert and send       the new PNG to the buffer via standard output.      from subprocess import call      callconvert thumbnail 400x600gt density 96 quality 85          url          png, shellTrue      from StringIO import StringIO       heres where the problem starts. Im clearly not reading      in the stdout correctly, as I get a IOError File not open for reading      from this next line of code      completeStdin  sys.stdout.read     im  StringIOcompleteStdin       now take the StringIO PNG object and save it back to S3 this       should not be an issue.      im  defaultstorage.openplg.png, wb     im.close codepre  pCan anyone tell me a where I might be going wrong with regards sending the output back to the thumbnail function, and b whether you can suggest any more robust alternatives to what seems a pretty hacky way of doing thisp  pTIAp

Negative 5962 pI have an application built with SproutCore, and recently several Windows 7 users have reported that mouseclicks buttons, radio buttons, etc. dont work at all, on either the latest Chrome or Firefox browsers.p  pAfter trying several Windows 7 computers, I finally found one that replicates the problem. Not only that, I found that the problem is visible on the official SproutCore demo sites, a hrefhttpshowcase.sproutcore.com relnofollowhttpshowcase.sproutcore.coma and a hrefhttpdemo.sproutcore.com relnofollowhttpdemo.sproutcore.coma. While the latter is running an old version of SC, the former is running SproutCore 1.10.0.p  pOn the demo site, none of the controls that require a mouseclick work. The main demo selector scrolls with the scroll wheel, but nothing can be selected.

One of the computers is running Windows 7 Ultimate SP 1, the other two are running Windows 7 Professional SP 1.

Negative 5962 pIm looking for a fast algorithm that can be used to solve this problem Giving A and B integers in the range [0,1018], and giving a list of N Nlt1000 numerical substrings the goal is to count all the numbers in the range [A,B] containing any of the N substrings. Weve always AltB and the numerical substrings are also integers in the range [0,1018].p  pExample1 if A10, B22, and giving N2 substrings1,10  the count would be  11 counting the numbers 1019 and 21.p  pExample2 If A175, B201, and giving N3 substrings55,0,200  the count would be  4 counting the numbers 180, 190, 200 and 201.p  pThe straightforward way is to analyse each integer in the range [A,B], one after another, but its not a solution since the range can be so big until 1018 integers.p  pOne first thing I did to reduce the problem complexity is to delete some useless substrings from the original list of N substrings, such that no substring is contained in another. For example 1,10 becomes 1 and 55,0,200 becomes 55,0. This wont change the final count.p  pNext, even assuming we can get the count for one substring in the range [A,B], we still cannot sum this count with those of other substrings from the list, as one number can contain many substrings and should not be counted more than once.p  pAny ideas to solve the problem et get the wanted countp

Negative 5962 pI have looked all over the place and there are a ton of similar questions on this site, but I havent found one that works and Im wondering what Im doing wrong.

Negative 5962 pBefore adding section headers to one of my tables in my app, I was able to delete rows using the commitEditingStyle function without any issues. I decided to implement section headers to make it easier for the user to view items added to the table by date. This functionality works fine. I was having an issue with deleting rows after implementing the section headers but thanks to help from the good folks on stackoverflow the problem was partially resolved. After some testing Ive realized that if the rows are in the same section and I try to delete more than one row in sequence beginning with the top row in the section, the top row deletes fine but trying to delete the second row causes the app to crash. If I delete all rows in sequence other than the first row and then delete the first row last, it works fine.

Negative 5962 pI have a script that opens and modifies a text file. The text file which contains personnel info and a lunch account balance. My script takes the text file removes the quotes and only writes rows that contain the values D, F or R in column 8. It writes this filtered data to two files, a csv import file called lunchimport.csv for a separate program and a csv temp file called to be used for further filtering. The second stage of the script uses the csv temp file to generate two additional csv files. One file, negativebal.csv, contains only rows with a negative value in column 14. The other file, lowbal.cav, contains rows with a value between 0 and 5 in column 14. My issue is that I cant get the script to filter between values properly. When using the code below to just write rows with values in column14 between 0 and 5 nothing will filter out. If I use values between 0 and 1.99 it works. Anything greater than 1.99 and the code doesnt filter anything p  precodeif row[13] gt 0 and row[13] lt 1.99     lowwriter.writerow[row[0], row[13]] codepre  pI have pasted my entire code below.

Negative 5962 pI can see the nominalFrameRate for some video tracks, but not current frame in AVFoundation docs. How can I get the current frame number of the track as it is played in an AVPlayer I know frame rates will vary, and nominalFrameRate will always be 0.0 in .m3u8 streams, but surely there must be a way to get the frame number of the currently playing track without having to multiply nominalFrameRate by currentTimep  pThanks.p
Negative 5962 pSome background Im on sql server 2005 I know     ...p  pstrongBrieflystrong I am concatenating three codevarcharcode columns and converting them to codenvarcharcode as a column in a schemabound, indexed view. All three columns are pkeys and not null. But when the conversion takes place the resulting column is set to allow nulls and then cannot take part in a fulltext index. If the concatenation is not converted to nvarchar then the column is implicitly created as codenot nullcode.

Negative 5962 pThis is a difficult one to figure out. We have a solution that includes a User Application and a WCF Service that use the same back end business layer code to create API calls to an external application. Most of the API calls happen just fine from either the two work flows. However, one specific API call does not work correctly in the WCF Service bit. p  pEssentially, my question is why would an API call work in a User Application that tests the API call, basically running the process from the UI, and not when it is called from the Service layer an automated process. We are trying to login to an application and the API calls are working from our User Interface which builds the back end process, but when it is running through the automated process, the API call is not working.p  pHave any of you run across this particular issue Any help would be greatly appreciated. p

What it does is export a major report in an excel spreadsheet.br The problem is surprisingly enough, it happens to work perfectly in... IE. All of the versions. Chrome seems to go over the  codeResponse.ContentTypecode instruction, and attempts to save the resulting file in a .ASP file format... which goes badly, of course. br Until now, all weve been doing is asking our fellow clients and support attendants to simply change their browsers to an old, unreliable browser e.g. IE. However, weve just sold a project to a client whose browser was officialy locked as being Google Chrome. br So... I have no idea as of how to solve this problem. brMy ContentType instruction isp  precode    Response.ContentType  applicationvnd.msexcel codepre  pAnd it goes on below, creating the table with a common html structure.p  pHelp please Dp

Negative 5962 pIm currently examining ways to display realtime information in 3D. In the past, Ive succesfully used Knockout.js in combination with WebSockets for visualizing data in realtime with a conventional HTML UI.p  pA few days ago I started playing around with Three.js and I was surprised how easytouse it is. Now I thought, maybe you can bind the viewmodel to properties of certain objects in a Three.js scene For example, binding a boolean value in the viewmodel to the visibility or color of a cube. Has anyone tried that before How would you accomplish the binding Are there perhaps any custom solutionsp  pI could start building some routines that take care of the binding, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel. Thanks for your comments and thoughts on this topicp  pUpdate I havent mentioned the CSS3D capabilities of Three.js that would alllow databinding because I want to avoid this technique for performance reasons and go straight for WebGL.p

Negative 5962 pIm in the process of comparing MvvmCross with ReactiveUI for a major pharma project on Win Store, WP8, iOS, Droid. Weve already selected Xamarin.p  pIm totally new to ReactiveUI. I really like what I see in principle, and I think Paul is a genius. However the details are becoming a real bear. Ive spend several days tracking down documentation the manual is from 2011 and seems almost entirely outdated  it doesnt even contain the word Router and sample code. p  pIm looking at the sample from ReactiveUI.Samples Also the project MobileSampleRT from the ReactiveUI solution.p  pI based my little hello world on the ReactiveUI.Samples Routing example. Frankly this isnt much of an example as all it does is navigate from AppBootstrapper to the one and only view. Im trying to do something similar to the three page example from MobileSampleRT. The problem is, if I try something like this in my projectp  precodeHostScreen.Router.Navigate.ExecuteRxApp.DependencyResolver.GetServicetypeofLoginViewModel codepre  pIt crashes pdb symbols not loaded in ReactiveUI.dllp  pIf I try thisp  precodeHostScreen.Router.NavigateCommandForltLoginViewModelgt.ExecuteHostScreen codepre  pSame result  hard crash. That really threw me as it seems like something that should just work.p  pI can call thisp  precodeHostScreen.Router.Navigate.Executenew LoginViewModelHostScreen codepre  pAnd it does go to my view, as expected. I also wired up a back button in the main screenp  precodethis.OneWayBindAppBootstrapper, x gt x.Router.NavigateBack, x gt x.BackButton.Command codepre  pAnd that indeed moves back from the view to which Id just navigated.p  pSo now I want to move forward again. I click on the button that does this againp  precodeHostScreen.Router.Navigate.Executenew LoginViewModelHostScreen codepre  pAnd I go back to that view. However this time it takes 2 clicks on the back button to get actually move back. If I then move forward again, it takes 3 clicks the next time. The NavigationStack is filling up with new instances of LoginViewModel.p  pSo, what IS the correct way to do routingnavigation Why are those commands crashing Rather than calling new each time in the Navigate.Execute, how do I navigate to a viewmodel that is already in the navigation stack or should it be there in the first place.p  pMany thanks for any clarity you can provide.p
Negative 5962 pI have 6 sliders, each with a respective value from 0100.

A train is considered active ifp  ul liIt has at least 1 movement associated with its activation I.E. has not left its originli liIt does not have a movement associated with its final calling pointli liIt was activated less than 24 hours agoli ul  pA train should always be considered active if all of these criteria are met, so listed in the count.p  pWith the data in the above sqlfiddle, a train leaves its first calling point at 1420 and arrives at its last calling point at 1504, it should be included in the count for every minute from 14201504.

If I touch between the second and the third star, I get rating  2 and I get two and a fragment filled stars.p  pImagine this if F is a full star, P is a partial but not as in a half star and E is an empty star, if I touch the second star, and between the 2nd and the 3rd I getp  pF P E E  Rating  1               F F P E rating  2p  pEdit The images can be found here a hrefhttp1drv.ms1pyq3gS relnofollowhttp1drv.ms1pyq3gSap  pIf I return the value to 5, the bar behaves as expected, with the filled stars coinciding with the rating.p  pI can not insert images, to explain this behavior, but I hope its clear enough.p  pDoes anybody knows why is this happening and how to correct itp

I realize that this code is very simple, but I simplified it down for the sake of asking a question. When I try to run the Test sub, I a compile errror ByRef argument type mismatch and the variable ItemSold. The reason I am using a letter is that codeRangecode needs a letter, but codeCells.EndxlUp.Rowcode needs a number.p  pIt works if I move  codeItemsSold  Ncode to the sub from the function, but this means this code would have to go in every sub rather than in just one function.p  pFunctionp  precodeFunction ColNumColumnNumber As String As Integer Dim ItemsSold As String ItemsSold  N ColNum  RangeReplace, , ColumnNumber.Column End Function codepre  pMacrop  precodeSub Test Dim TotalItemsSold As Integer TotalItemsSold  CellsRows.Count, ColNumItemsSold.EndxlUp.Row End Sub codepre

Negative 5962 pIm currently implementing a sample UI for a hrefhttpneovim.org relnofollowneovima, and decided to use Tkinterpython due to the popularitysimplicity of the platforms. The problem Im having is that tkinter seems to stack UI updates when the window height crosses a certain threshold.p  pa hrefhttpyoutu.beoWgHWTT9Rf0 relnofollowHerea is a video that shows the problem.p  pThe right window is a terminal emulator running neovim, and the left window is the Tkinter UI program connected to it. The idea is that the tkinter UI should mirror neovim terminal screen, including dimensions. In this video never take focus away from the terminal window, so the only events Tk has to process come from the connection to neovimvirtual nvim events which describe screen updatesp  pThe first part of the video shows that everything works nicely when the window height is small, but starts to lag updates when I increase the height.p  pa hrefhttppastebin.comcvrgjrzz relnofollowHerea is the code for the Tkinter program. While neovim API is very new and still in heavy developmentthe code may not make sense to some readers, I think the problem Im trying to solve is close to implementing terminal emulatorusing Tk text widget it must handle large bursts of formatted text updates efficiently.p  pIm very inexperienced in GUI programming. Is Tkinter a wise choice for this task If yes, then could someone give me a hint of what Im doing wrongp  pTo explain a bit whats happening Neovim API is threadsafe, and the codevim.nexteventcode method blockswithout busy waiting, it uses a libuv event loop underneath until an event is received.p  pWhen the the codevim.nexteventcode call returns, it will notify Tkinter thread using codegenerateeventcode, which will do the actual event processingit also buffers events between coderedrawstartcode and coderedrawstopcode to optimize screen updates.p  pSo there are actually two event loops running in parallel, with the background event loop feeding the Tkinter event loop in a threadsafe waythe codegenerateeventcode method is one of the few that can be called from other threadsp

Negative 5962 pId like to know how to improve my own kind of templates helper. For instance, I made an codeautocomplete.scala.htmlcode that receives parameters in order to be dynamic, something likep  precodeautocompleteelementLabel,dataurlwhereitsgoingtogetJSONdata,anyother,etc,foo codepre  pThen I can use codeautocompletecode component in any page I want to.p  pBut Im wondering how to make it easier to use, for instance, Plays codeinputTextcode helper has the option you can add parameters using     parametername and then  probably lambda so, how could i implement it, so, I could, for instance make something likep  precodeautocompletedataurl,someattributegtvalue, anotherOneWithUnderscoreWhyBtwgtwhyunderscore  codepre  pautocomplete.scala.htmlp  precode    Componente para pesquisa textual e seleo de registro de relacionamento 1 para N        Example     autocompleteexample.nested.id, Unidade, sistemabuscarExemplo, myForm.get.getUnidade.getId.toString, myForm.get.getUnidade.getLabel.toString    fieldId String, fieldTitle String, dataUrl String, initIdValue String, initTitleValue String      ltdiv classformgroupgt         ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm12 colmd12 collg12gt         ltlabel forfieldId classcontrollabelgtfieldTitleltlabelgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm12 colmd12 collg12gt         ltspan classinputicon inputiconright stylewidth100gt             ltinput typetext classautocompleterelation              namefieldId              dataurldataUrl              dataidstatusfieldTitle              datainitidvalueinitIdValue             datainitnomevalueinitTitleValue             stylewidth100             gt             lti idresponsefieldTitle classiconsearch bluegtltigt         ltspangt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pAs soon as new requirements appear i must add one more parameter and then modify it at all pages i call it. I wanted to use that component like that original checkbox, from play, for instancep  precodecheckboxmyFormmyField,label gtMYLABEL, classgtMYCLASS   OR  checkboxmyFormmyField,class gtMYCLASS,labelgtMYLABEL   or even  checkboxmyFormmyField,class gtMYCLASS,labelgtMYLABEL,anotheattributegtVALUE codepre  pand so on. How could I do it so I wouldnt have to fill all of them and the order wouldnt matterp

Negative 5962 pI have a perl script that I wrote that gets some image URLs, puts the urls into an input file, and proceeds to run wget with the codeinputfilecode option. This works perfectly... or at least it did as long as the image filenames were unique.p  pI have a new company sending me data and they use a very TROUBLESOME naming scheme. All files have the same name, code0.jpgcode, in different folders.p  pfor example p  precodecdn.blah.comfolderfolder2027930002027931230.jpg cdn.blah.comfolderfolder1984780001984787250.jpg cdn.blah.comfolderfolder1985940001985940800.jpg codepre  pWhen I run my script with this, wget works fine and downloads all the images, but they are titled code0.jpg.1code, code0.jpg.2code, code0.jpg.3code, etc. I cant just count them and rename them because files can be broken, not available, whatever.p  pI tried running wget once for each file with codeOcode, but its embarrassingly slow starting the program, connecting to the site, downloading, and ending the program. Thousands of times. Its an hour vs minutes.p  pSo, Im trying to find a method to change the output filenames from wget without it taking so long. The original approach works so well that I dont want to change it too much unless necessary, but i am open to suggestions.p  pAdditionalp  pcodeLWPSimplecode is too simple for this. Yes, it works, but very slowly. It has the same problem as running individual wget commands. Each codegetcode or codegetstorecode call makes the system reconnect to the server. Since the files are so small 60kB on average with so many to process 1851 for this one test file alone that the connection time is considerable.p  pThe filename i will be using can be found with codedd.jpgicode where the filename will simply be code12code to get code2027931230.jpgcode. Not really important for this question.p  pIm now looking at codeLWPUserAgentcode with codeLWPConnCachecode, but it times out andor hangs on my pc. I will need to adjust the timeout and retry values. The inaugural run of the code downloaded 693 images 43mb in just a couple minutes before it hung. Using simple, I only got 200 images in 5 minutes.p  precodeuse LWPUserAgent use LWPConnCache  chompfilelist  ltINPUTFILEgt my browser  LWPUserAgentgtnew browsergtconncacheLWPConnCachegtnew  foreachfilelist     dd.jpgi     my newfilename  1.2      response  browsergtmirror, folder . newfilename     die response failure ifresponsegtiserror  codepre

Negative 5962 pFor a project I need to go through all the pixels of an image and identify color ranges.  Right now, Ive written code that will go through all the pixels and construct an ArrayList of colors for each pixel.  Now, I need to figure out a way to go through my ArrayList and identify groupings of colors.  For clarification, in all pictures there are really only 3 different colors.  Obviously due to varying brightness across the picture the pixels dont exactly match the RGB values of the 3 different colors.  Thus, I need to find a way to identify a range of variation for each of the 3 different colors.  My theory is to construct a graph of the colors in the ArrayList and identify the color ranges by looking for gaps between color groupings.  Im just not sure how to go about doing this.  Any suggestions are welcome  p

Negative 5962 pI have a number of separate SSL servers on my internal network which I want to expose to the public Internet on a single IP address and port. All my clients are guaranteed to support the servername TLS extension a.k.a.Server Name Indication or SNI.p  pWhat I imagine is, that nginx will look at the TLS client hello message of an incoming connection and figure out which internal IP to forward the connection to. Then nginx acts as a TCP tunnel, i.e. nginx itself is not participating in any TLS sessions even though it peeks into incoming TLS client hello messages, and needs no SSL cert or private key of its own.p  pIn other words, the TLS session is initiated on the client, passesthru nginx which multiplexes the destinations using the servername information in TLS client hello and terminates in the destination server.p  pCan this be done with nginx and how If not, are you aware of some other proxy software that can do thisp  pBest Regards,br rkprp

Negative 5962 pIm working on a Youtube API based project in which Ive already bootstrapped angular. Im encountering a problem when I need to call an external JS to load the iFrame API js file first and then allow angular to work on it on specific routes.p  pThe problem is that Youtube iFrame API calls strongonYouTubeIframeAPIReadystrong function just after loading and this function needs an html element with strongid  playerstrong, and I want to load this iFrame API only in certain views. Hence strongiFrame API cant be called from indexstrong file because it would not find any element with strongidplayerstrong.p  pBut if I call it from one of the views itself, then the API takes time to create a strongYTPlayer objectstrong. Meanwhile, a controller would have called for it and didnt find it.p  pHow do I go about thisp  pIm still learning the concept of Resolve, so Im not sure how can I leverage it in this scenario.p

I was just thinking through the viability of using it in an existing web project. p  pIt seems like the number one problem is where to manage the event loop. Are WSGI requests all done on a single thread or are they their own threads p  pI suppose one way to use it is if a single request has multiple tasks that could be performed in a non blocking manner, that might be useful. For instance if a request needed to go out and retrieve more than one file from another place on the web. You could create an event loop within the request just to perform the collection nonblocking operations more efficiently.p  pIs that about the only way to really utilize AsyncIO in an existing web project at the momentp

The search is live, so results are brought up as the user types. p  pnow the first and current approach i took, is that the page actually connects to the mySQL server and retrieves content via AJAX, with EVERY letter the user types in the search box. p  pnow i am starting to look at JSON objects i only very recently started building websites, and was wondering if it would be a good idea, to load the entire database into a JSON object in the beginning and then look through that when searching. p  pis this a good idea would it be faster thanks in advancep

Negative 5962 pI am using MongoDB and Morphia, my goal is to make a chat.p  pMy idea is to request all the messages that have a bigger sequential number than a specified number.p  pFor example if you request message 0, you will receive all messages, but if you request message 100, you will only receive messages with sequential number greater than 100.p  pIf there is no message found, the requester should be locked until a message appears, by other words, the requester waits for future messages.p  pMy question is, how is that implemented with MongoDB and Morphia I dont want to query if there is a newer message periodically...p  pDoes MongoDB supports locking until there is a resultp  pThank you p

Negative 5962 pFor years, Ive handcoded my view code for iPhone apps, but now Im giving storyboards another look.p  pOne common pattern in my code is to use the same view controller in two places, but with slight UI variations. For example, when browsing a list of brands codeBrandListControllercode, Id like to show a table view of all brands in the system tapping a brand shows you its products. But when filtering items by brand, Id like to show a table view of brands with the same content and same cell appearance, but Id like tapping a row to take you back to the filter screen instead of showing you that brands items. Id also like a Search bar button item in the top right.p  pIts easy to make these things happen in code, by just adding a boolean member variable so the controller can be configured before its presented.p  pBut how would I do this with storyboards I could have multiple controllers segue to the same instance of codeBrandListControllercode, but again, I would want the controller to have different behavior and includeexclude UI elements based on how its used. It seems like a bad idea to create two separate instances of codeBrandListControllercode in the storyboard, because then I would have to duplicate all the outlet connections and I would have to keep changes in sync. But what are my other optionsp

Negative 5962 h2Backgroundh2  pI am using slf4j with Logback as underlying logger. p  pA system i.e., a bunch of interoperating classes can be concurrently used by a client.

Negative 5962 pIm using a hrefhttps71squared.comparticledesigner relnofollowParticle Designera to create a particle emitter for use in my iPhoneiPad app. The program outputs a configuration file which can be used to render a particle system in a GLKit View.p  pThe issue Im having is that the emitter is defined in terms of absolute pixel sizes, e.g. the source might be set at 20,400, and the particles are generated within 200 horizontal pixels from that spot... which is fine if Im building for just one device.  But I need to support iPhone 4566 and iPad, and would much rather not have to make 5 different versions of every particle emitter.p  pMy intuition is that I should be able to just make the GLKit View scale everything up, so that what would have taken up a rectangle of size 320x480pt will stretch so it fills the screen, with all the GLrendered particles etc. scaling to match.p  pAm I right Is there indeed a straightforward way to do thisp

Negative 5962 h2Edit The reason I am askingh2  pI think I have to clarity that the platform I am using and the reason I am asking to make it easier for you to answer this question I am using a x8664 machine with gcc and Ubuntu and I am working on some interpreter of some toy language and I think tagged pointer is a neat trick can be used. I know Apple is using it. So I just want to try it out.p  hr  pI was reading something about tagged pointer and I was wondering, how can I know how many free bits are there in a pointer on a particular machine. p  pFor now my understanding is that if I am using a 64 bit machine, then when accessing memory the CPU will always access memory address that are multiple of 8 bytes. So it leaves 2 bits in the end of a pointer always set to 0. Also, if on a x8664 machine, the first 14 bits will be always 0 right Since they are never used by the CPU. codemalloccode will make sure that the pointers it gives back will always be aligned. But how about other memory locations Say variables on the stackp  pHow can I confirm thisp  pSomebody in the comments suggested that 2 bits I mentioned in the above is not right, indicating I am a bad programmer. I do not deny that I am not a very professional programmer, but I think I shall explain a bit a bout why I said 2 instead of 3.p  pI wrote a very simple program like thisp  precode include ltstdio.hgt  include ltstdlib.hgt  int main     int a  0     printfpn, ampa     int p  mallocsizeofint     printfpn, p   codepre  pAnd I compiled it with gcc and run it over 10000 iteration on a 64 bit machine with Ubuntu. I discovered that codeampacode always end up with last 4 bits as code1100code  and p always end up with code0000code, so I want to be conservative about how many bits are actually unused by the compiler. Thats why I said 2 instead of 3.p  pAlso if you can help me explain what I have been observed codeampacode ends up with 1100, which only have 2 bits set to 0, I would deeply appreciate it. p

Ive made a Mac application to test this then looked for the item with Keychain Access to find that it was indeed there. However, this was using a codekSecClasscode of codekSecClassGenericPasswordcode I dont know if this is relevant, but this test application Id written in ObjectiveC. At this point Id decided to check which attributes are available if I were to use codekSecClassGenericPasswordcode in my iOS application. Sadly, codekSecValueDatacode isnt available for that codekSecClasscode, either.p  pSo where in the world do I set the password if codekSecValueDatacode isnt an applicable attribute to codekSecClassGenericPasswordcode, codekSecClassInternetPasswordcode, nor any other codekSecClasscode itemsp  pIve noticed that Im allowed to use codekSecAttrGenericcode with these codekSecClasscode items namely codekSecClassGenericPasswordcode and codekSecClassInternetPasswordcode and it takes a value of codeCFDataRefcode. Im assuming that means Im expected to pass codeNSDatacode as codeCFDataRefcode to this attribute, but what do I pass as the codeNSDatacode Should that be a codeDictionarycode Should that be an codeNSASCIIStringEncodingcode value of the password codeStringcode Does this mean I can make any codekSecAttrcode value myself somehowp  pThanks for reading.

Im hoping that someone here can explain what steps I am missing.p  pstrongAttempt 1  Sensorsstrongp  pThe first solution I tried was using Sensors on each side of a Dynamic body. The issue with this solution is that multiple sensors can easily collide with a single obstacle. For example   img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlUowr.png altBox2D Sensorsp  pstrongAttempt 2  Determine side of contact using the World Normalstrongp  pMy second solution was to get the Normal from the b2WorldManifold that is provided by the contact in BeginContact. This works perfectly, but only for detecting the side when a collision begins, not when it ends. EndContact doesnt have the ability to provide a World Normal. You can get the manifold, but the components of the Normal are undefined. The issue with this is that I have no way of knowing which collision just ended.p  pHopefully someone knows enough about Box2D to see something simple that I am obviously missing.

Negative 5962 pI have some numbercrunching jobs that I run in parallel on a cluster. Right now, Im using codemake jcode to run several jobs on a single computer, whilst providing some load balancing  some jobs may be finished faster than the other. When scaling to multiple machines, I just divide the number of jobs evenly to several makefiles, blindly hoping that each makefile will take roughly equal time to finish.p  pNow, my question is  is there an easy way to run N independent jobs on M machines in parallel, while strongproviding global load balancingstrongp  pIm on a Linux Bullx cluster where PBS is installed, and there is also GNU parallel although Ive never used that one and it seems to me that it will not loadbalance between the computing nodes, after reading through the manual.p

Negative 5962 pIf you have a desktop application on different clients which use the same database how do you notify the other clients if one client has changed data. Say if you as a client number 1 is looking at a datagrid with different customers and client number 2 updates a name on one of the customers you are looking at in the datagrid.

For example when you call codeJFramesetDefaultCloseOperationcode you can pass an integer value as argument or use one of the static members of the codeJFramecode class.p  precodeJFrame frame  new JFrame frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.DISPOSEONCLOSE codepre  pWouldnt it be better to define an enumerations for those actions because it would be impossible to pass just any integer as argument to the method.

What would be a reason to use this approach and avoid enumerationsp
Negative 5962 pJust to start with , I am not a very experienced programmer in Access. Is there any way I can disable the import error tables which are auto generated by access when you import files from excel  p  pThe reason I want to do this is my excel file has about 4000 rows with data about different locations,now the location I have to do the reporting on is importing properly thats why I am not worried about about the import errors . Also, it only detects the error in one row and because I import the table from vba code it will keep generating this error tables and I end up with big bunch of them.p  pI did some research but I find answer about solving the issue by fixing the file format of import , but I failed to get the answer about how to disable them.p  pAppreciate if anyone can help.p  pEDIT  p  pAfter suggestion from parfait following code did the trick.

Negative 5962 pI am reviewing code by another developer. He has a commit that explicitly adds codeset autocommit0code at the start of a MySQL transaction.

Negative 5962 pUntil very recently we ran a 3rd party HR database on an Oracle Unix environment.  I have additionally set up various web services that hit stored procedures to carry out a few bespoke processes for our users, and all ran well for years. However, now that we have moved to Oracle on a Windows environment there is suddenly a big problem.br The best example I have is a VB.Net solution that reads in a 2000 row CSV of employees into a datatable, runs a couple of stored procedures to bring back Post Id etc, populates a database table with the results, then feeds it all back out into a new CSV.  This process used to take 12 minutes to complete on Unix.  It now takes well over 2 hours and kills the server The problem manifests by overwhelming the CPU on the database server.  Any stored procedure call sends Oracle.EXE into overdrive, completely maxing out the CPU core that its using such that no other stored procedures can be run and everything grinds to a halt. We have run Oracle Enterprise Manager, which suggested the creation of some indexes etc, but nothing will improve the issue.  Like I say, the SQL ran fine and swiftly for years, and it hasnt changed at all.p  pDoes anybody know what could be causing this  I am completely at a loss.p  pThe way I see it, it must either be 1. A CPUhardware issue but we have investigated, added extra cores etc to no avail 2. An Oracle configuration issue or 3. An issue with the 3rd party database which is supposedly identical to what it was on Unix.p  pThanks to anyone who read this far.p  pP.S. Ive had a Stack Overflow user account for years but cant get logged into it any more.  Back to noobie status for mep

Negative 5962 pIn my Backbone project, I have a router which creates a View, codeviewAcode.p  pcodeviewAcode creates a subview, codeviewA2code as part of its render process.p  pcodeviewA2code has a collection which contains Card models, but I also declare another Collection of Tag models in codeviewA2code s codeinitializecode function. Like sop  precodeinitialize function           this.tagCollection  new tagModels.TagCollection          this.tagCollection.fetch             reset true                  this.listenTothis.collection, changetags, this.updateContentList         this.listenTothis.collection, reset remove, this.updateContentList         this.listenTothis.tagCollection, reset, this.resetTags         this.listenTothis.tagCollection, add, this.addTag         this.listenTothis.tagCollection, remove, this.removeTag  codepre  pNow at some point the router switches pages in the app, gets rid of codeviewAcode and replaces it with codeviewBcode. Before switching to codeviewBcode I dop  precodeviewA2.tagCollection.reset viewA2.remove viewA.remove codepre  pAccording to the Backbone extension in Chrome, both codeviewAcode and codeviewA2code are destroyed, but codeviewA2.tagCollectioncode still exists, even though it has been reset and contains no models. Every time I switch views, another Collection is added.p  pWhy doesnt the empty Collection die The View which it was a property of no longer exists. Ive also tried codeviewA2.stopListeningcode before removing codeviewA2code.p  pI realise that one way of bypassing this problem is to create the codetagCollectioncode further up the chain, for example in the router, and pass a reference to it to codeviewAcode, and from there to codeviewA2code. This might be a better design for my app., but it feels clumsy passing references up and down the chain of views. Should I be taking that approach anywayp  pFinally. Im aware that listening to two Collections in one View may not be best practice. If that is deemed to be a major issue I can give more details as to why Ive done it that way.p

Negative 5962 pI am trying to plot data from two separate studies in different colors in a line plot using ggplot2. This data comes from two independent studies that used a withingroup design multiple siblings in the same family, but each in different treatment groups. Thus, Ive used group aesthetic to group individuals by family and, thus, to draw lines between individuals within the same family. This part works well, now all I want is for the the data collected in two separate studies to be represented in different colors. Ive played around a bunch, manually changing the color, etc. and I just cant get it to work. Everything that Ive seen online about manually changing the line color depends on group aesthetic, and I need color and group to be independent of each other in this case.p  pThe data is in long format, with Study as a factor. I then used the summarySEwithin function, which comes from the Rcookbook code for plotting means Available here a hrefhttpwww.cookbookr.comGraphsPlottingmeansanderrorbars28ggplot229 relnofollowhttpwww.cookbookr.comGraphsPlottingmeansanderrorbars28ggplot229a to build the data frame copied below.p  precodeSimilarity90SUMlt summarySEwithinDay90, measurevarSimilarity, betweenvarscCondition,Study,withinvarscFamily, idvarMaleNum,na.rmTRUE codepre  pI then used ggplot to build the line plot. This code does everything I want, except plot the data from the two studies in separate colors.p  precodeggplotSimilarity90SUM, aesxCondition, ySimilarity, groupFamily,colourStudy    geomline    geompointshape19, size2   scalecolourmanualvaluescblue,darkgreen codepre  pUnfortunately, all of the lines in the plot are black, rather than blue and green sorry, I cant post the image.p  pI think that the issue derives from the fact that the variables used for group and colour are different because if I include colourStudy in the aes, then I get the error message Error Aesthetics must either be length one, or the same length as the dataProblemsCondition, Similarity, Family. Any suggestions would be helpful Im sure there is some relatively simple workaround that Im just not aware of.

Negative 5962 pI solved this problem in Xcode 6.2 by following the advice in previous, similar postings. It has reappeared in Xcode 6.3 and is not as easily corrected.p  pI have a mixed, objectivec and c project where files that contain c code are named .mm and project settings are at the default. If I load in a small set of c files and call a c functor from the view controller of a canned singlepage iOS application in a new project created to isolate the problem, it compiles successfully. Then, when I try to add a folder containing previously written and successfully compiled mixed code, the following error appears.p  pstronglexical or preprocessor issue, array file not foundstrongp  pI then tried combinations C Language Dialect and C Language Dialect as c11  gnu11 and cc11  gnu11  cc14 in the build settings and the error remained.p  pRemoving the reference to the group of addition files gets the compilation to succeed again and does even if the build setting point to gnu11 or c11.p  pHow does the addition or removal of files that all compiled under Xcode 6.2 have to do with the compiler finding or not finding the standard template header filep

Negative 5962 pIm developing a multibrowser extension using the Crossrider framework.  Is there a solution to show an html horizontal menu on the top of each page   The menu will embed a JS script which uses some external libraries.p  pIndeed, I can prepend my html content to the body tag but each time the user clicks on a link on the webpage, the whole page is reloaded which makes the horizontal bar disapear and then reappear on the next page when the loading is completed.p  pI thought of putting the website content into an iframe but some websites ex amazon send a header with the XFrameOptions set to DENY or SAMEORIGIN. This is something which Crossrider cannot modify at least I didnt find how to do that.p  pIs there an other way to show a PERMANENT menu on top of each page p  pbr strongEDIT strongbr My toolbar wont contain any link but it will record the mouse position. My problem is that each time the user will click on a website link ex  to see a product on the amazon website, the toolbar will be reloaded and so the mouse position wont be recorded until the next page has finished its loading.p
Negative 5962 pThe way I am handling the index for the current page is wrong I think. For some reason the pages seem to skip around for no reason. Each page is a different subclass of uiviewcontroller so for the item index Ive been handling like so this at top of filep  precodevar index Int  1 I am starting it at page 1 instead of 0 on purpose codepre  pand I am using that in the methods     func pageViewControllerpageViewController UIPageViewController, viewControllerBeforeViewController viewController UIViewController  UIViewController p  precode    let itemController  viewController as UIViewController      if self.index gt 0          self.index  self.index  1         return getItemControllerself.index           return nil   func pageViewControllerpageViewController UIPageViewController, viewControllerAfterViewController viewController UIViewController gt UIViewController       let itemController  viewController as UIViewController       if self.index1 lt cards.count          self.index  self.index1         return getItemControllerself.index           return nil  codepre  pnow normally Id cast the item controller as the subclass of uiviewcontroller and have an instance variable for saving the item index, but since I am using different uiviewcontroller sub classes depending on the index I cant do this.p  pThe way I have this setup is this the reason it seems to jump around randomly when I slide through the pagesp

Negative 5962 pI have a ListView with custom cell factory. I compute maximum over cells minWidth and set it as minWidth for entire ListView. So the ListView constrained by other regions in the layout is shrunk exactly to minWidth. But cells it holds are resized to preferred width, not minimal. As a result nodes do not fit to containing viewport and horizontal scrollbar is shown.p  pIts nasty. Id like to make each cell exactly fit to ListView, and get rid of scrollbar. More precise. When ListView is reduced to its minimal width, all its cells should also be reduced to this minimal width.p  pIm searching for some controlling property that switches cell resizing policy of for some hack to achieve described behavior in case there are no predefined switches.p  hr  pemupdate added graphic exampleemp  pI created SplitPane to simplify testing layouts. I can define layout restrictions by moving its separator with mouse.p  pFirst shot shows the initial problem actual dimensions min, max, pref of cell nodes are not respected. The ListView always use prefWidth even if its greater than viewport width. So horizontal scroll is used when it may be avoided.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrNzax.png altbadp  pAfter that I tried to manually set preferred width smaller. So cell now is completely visible. This is not the solution. I give this shot to prove that the cell have sufficiently small minWidth to fit inside the ListView.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4ARWE.png altuglyp  pThe last shot is ugly too. It leaves free space that may be filled with cell content. Its is natural if viewport is larger than preferred width and smaller than maximum width, than it should be used for resizing the cell content.p  pThe issue may be suppressed by switching to static sizes of elements specified explicitly. But doing so means to discard all benefits of dynamic layouts programmer would be obliged to change size constants each time new skin is applied with CSS and user would be prohibited to resize window or move separator with mouse.p  pAnd this is bad solution too. What I need  to make layout engine of javafx work. Minimal width of the ListView should be biggest minimal width of its cells. Maximum width of the ListView should be lowest maximum width of its cells. Preferred width of the ListView should biggest preferred width of its cells. And than actual width of ListView should be set by its parent SplitPane in this example with respects to all three layout bounds. And after that this size should be passed to cells.p  pHorizontal scrollbar should be displayed only in case some cell minimal width is too large to fit in viewport.p

Negative 5962 pHow would one go about calculating the angle of a vector versus an up direction while looking down the axis of another vector To illustrate what Im asking, Ive drawn two diagramsp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.com0JUb8uA.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com0JUb8uA.jpgap  pIn this image, you can see the general setup. The green arrows are the Y axis up is positive, down is negative, the red arrows are the X axis left is negative, right is positive, and the blue arrows are the Z axis towards the screen is positive, away is negative.p  pThe cyan and yellow arrows represent two normalized vectors length  1 centred around 0, 0, 0. The vectors can be anywhere in 3D space, Im just using this as an example the only thing guaranteed is that their length will always be 1 and the up direction will always be Vector0, 1, 0.p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comrdlEesZ.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comrdlEesZ.jpgap  pThis is what Im trying to figure out.

It seems like it might be possible to determine a rotation between the cyan arrow and a known axis, then rotate everything including the yellow arrow around the origin, at which point its just a matter of using atan2 to determine the angle based on two coordinates of the yellow vector ignoring the depth component, but Im guessing theres probably a simpler way of doing things.

Negative 5962 pIm making what amounts to a level editor for a game, and Im not sure the best way to store the game content as a file. To be clear, this is a design question, not a technical one.p  pThe game content can be broken down hierarchically into multiple levels, each with multiple scenes, that have multiple events, etc., each of which are relatively independent. However there are also data, such as items and characters, that will be referenced globally across the game.p  pIdeally this editor would support multiple users, who could each edit nonconflicting parts of the game content, and then merge the changes together without issue think source code in a version control system. Ideally, the game content should also be easy to load into the game once finished i.e. I should be able to load a level and have all necessary pieces load together without navigating a filesystem.p  pIve come up with a few ideas for how I could do this, none of which are wholly satisfactoryp  ul lipSplit the game content across many files, so that parallel edits are easy to make and merge. Use folder structure and a project file to keep track of files, something like how Visual Studio handles code projects. The cons are that this is harder to manage in the game, and its harder for content to reference other content in another file e.g. a character who has an item.pli lipUse a single binary file, but create merge functionality, similar to what MS Word does or how git merges text files. The cons are that this means you have to manually resolve all merge conflicts and the merge functionality will likely be nontrivial to implement.pli lipUse just a few files to represent large pieces of the game, and hope people using the editor are smart enough not edit the same one at the same time. The cons are selfevident, but this would be a good deal easier to implement.pli ul  pObviously I have underspecified the problem, but hopefully Ive given enough information for people to know what Im talking about. Does anyone have any helpful insights or has anyone had a similar problemp  pIf it helps, these will likely be .json files, versioned using git.p

Negative 5962 pFor the following I am using Python 2.7  Django 1.5.p  pI am trying to refactor some production code which overrides Django forms clean method with a custom validation procedure. It is repeated in several of the forms so we want to abstract it to an external function that we can just call within the forms.p  pSay I have the following,p  precode ... imports ...  class MyPropertiesmodels.Model     label  models.CharFieldmaxlength100, blankTrue, nullTrue, verbosenameulabel      def unicodeself         return self.label  class MyFormforms.ModelForm     choices  forms.ModelChoiceFieldrequiredFalse, ...      class Meta         model  MyProperties      def initself, args, kwargs         superMyForm, self.initargs, kwargs      def cleanself         return mycustomcleanfunctionself  def mycustomcleanfunctionforminstance     cleaneddata  supertypeforminstance, forminstance.clean  DOES NOT WORK       other validation routines     return cleaneddata codepre  pCalling super from the mycustomcleanfunction from outside the class leads to exceeding the maximum recursive depth is just calls the clean method in the forminstance class, which calls the custom function, etc...p  pCreating a temp instance of ModelForm and calling its clean method does not seem to work, since it would have none of the fields.p  pIs there any way to do this idiomatically, or would I be better off calling the parent clean method from inside the form class, and then passing that data to my custom method for further validationp

Negative 5962 pGood afternoon,p  pWe are developing an app for smartwatch and mobile phone.p  pWe need to transfer some data from the phone to the smartwatch and want to avoid using proprietary libraries.p  pSo we implemented a webserver in our app from which the smartwatch is able to read data.p  pThe problem is that in order to accomplish this, we need to write some data to a file every second. p  pThe smartwatch is downloading that data to a file every second. This means every second there are some bytes written on flash memory.p  pWe are wondering how harmful for the memory of our devices this is.

Deep function call seems more common for data parsingmanipulationvalidation. Dynamic allocation often happens at a higher level, before invoking the function where codesetjmpcode appears.p

Negative 5962 pIn a website there are 2 video tags with different ids.

Except the fact that videos are always loaded twice, which is waste of resources and waste of time. p  pHow to avoid this issue  p  pMy first approach was to use only one video element and move it from one place to the other as necessary. But his can be done only by some costly javascript code to trigger css styles, which I want to avoid.p  pMy second approach is to simply dereference the loaded video from  one element and reference it in the other one without getting loaded again, which always happens when one assigns it the usual way.p  pSo the final question is how to tell the browser to load a video emonly onceem but use in two different video tags, sequentially  Any hints how to achieve this  Would be great to get some help.p

Negative 5962 pI would like a point in the right direction. I am thinking of creating a website where each user would have the ability to upload Site Files and have their own Database to use for that specific site also perhaps providing user ftp to their project folders. Ultimately allowing clients to be able to preview user work live via the a hrefhttpSiteURLprojectfolder relnofollowhttpSiteURLprojectfoldera.p  pIs there any resource i can read about this i have tried searching on examples or something to get me in the right mindset of this. p  pThanksp

Negative 5962 pIm using TCPDF to generate a pdf out of HTML. In the code, there is an image with a codespancode below it. Unfortunately, my codespancode is overlapping my codeimgcode.p  pI know its better to set the codespancode as a codefigurecode, but since TCPDF doesnt support html5, I thought this was the best way to solve it.p  pThe code looks something like thisp  precodeltimg srcgt ltspangtSome text related to the imageltspangt codepre  pSo the output will print a image with a text on the bottom of the picture. Is there any way I can get the text below of the picturep
Negative 5962 pIm looking for an unamiguous info whether the bit width of raw integral types like codebytecode, codeshortcode, codeintcode, codelongcode, etc. in codeCcode and thus the mapping to CLI fixedwidth types like codeBytecode, codeInt16code, codeInt32code, codeInt64code, ... is fixed forever or it might change in the future language revision and we could face similar situations like in CC, where the builtin type is emat least N bits wideem.p  pThe motivation is could we safely use codeC.intcode as the emintegral type using 32 bits for its valueem, or is it better to just use codeCLI.Int32code for the cases we want exactly 32 bitsp

Negative 5962 pI have a codeUIImageViewcode subclass in swift set up so I can access touchesBegantouchesMovedtouchesEnded.p  pWhen one of these methods is called, I need to change a property of a different, loaded view.p  pIt seems to me that I will now need to access the active view controller in order to set the properties of this other view. Is there are better way to go about this such as event methods called in the view controllerp  pNote that Im new to iOS and I am not extremely familiar with the event system yet, as most information Ive found is written in Objective C and not in Swift. Dont worry, Im looking through Apples Documentation.p  pAlso, no, I cant change the codeUIImageViewcode to a codeUIButtoncode. Even if I changed to a codeUIButtoncode, I need access to the individual codetouchesBegancode, etc. methods and the same problem would persist.p
