Positive 23896 pSo, basically, I am playing with Fancy box, and basically, just want a title to remain the same for all images in a gallery that get loaded.  Yes, I can just keep this as title for all images, however, when changing between images, the title fades in and out like the image does.  Basically, I dont want the title fading here, I just want the image fading.  Because the Title is always the same.p  pHere is a fiddle that shows my current problem here with the Title of a Fancybox image galleryp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcce183893 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcce183893ap  pOn all images the title will never change.  As the title depicts the Image Gallery Name for now its just filled with dummy content.p  pI have thought of how to possibly include HTML also within a fancybox 2.1 Gallery of images, however, I can not do this properly either, looking at this link here  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsvsdx relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsvsdxa which adds content to a div instead, not a photo gallery of images as I would like to do.p  pHere is the code as I have it nowp  precodedocument.readyfunction  var galleryTitle  galleryTitleHTML.html      a.photogallery.fancybox         wrapCSS fancygallery,         openEffect fade,         closeEffect fade,         title galleryTitle,         tpl               wrap  ltdiv classfancyboxwrap tabIndex1gtltdiv classfancyboxoutergtltdiv classfancyboxinnergtltdivgtltdivgtltdivgt         ,         helpers               overlay                  css background rgba0,0,0,0.8              ,             title                  type outside,                 position top             ,             thumbs                   width 50,                 height 50                                 .openphotogallery.clickfunctione          e.preventDefault         var galleryImagesTotal  a.photogallery.length,             eqToLoad  Math.absMath.floorgalleryImagesTotal  2          a.photogalleryeq  eqToLoad  .click       codepre  pBasically, I would like to pull in a div from the page and place that content above the images.  Only way I can see doing this is with the Title, but the title fades as the images fade.  Just want to get rid of this fading on the title.p  pAlso, I would like the Gallery Title to fill the entire width of the top area, instead of changing to the width of the proportional image.p  pAnyway to do thisp

Negative 23896 pI have a datagrid in which I am using DataGridTemplateColumn and DataGridTextColumn. I want to access these columns at runtime so I have assigned xName property to them.

Negative 23896 pI have a codeListBoxcode that gets populated with items read from a JSON response. Each item has an codeImagecode control that displays the thumbnail at the remote URL given by the codeThumbnailcode property. I created a custom codeIValueConvertercode to convert the URL to a codeBitmapImagecode, but the image still didnt display. So I finally realized that I could capture loading errors with the codeImageFailedcode event.p  pWhat I get is an strongAGENETWORKERRORstrong. I looked at Silverlights a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc18900828VS.9529.aspx relnofollowURL Access Restrictionsa and the table states that loading an codeImagecode from another domain is allowed without a strongcrossdomain.xmlstrong file.p  pIm positive that the URL is valid and points to an image, because I can copy and paste it directly from the JSON and view it in a browser. Yet, Silverlight refuses to load it.p  pWhy is thisp  pstrongEDITstrong I installed Fiddler, which does show requests being made when the Silverlight page is loaded. None of these requests are for the image, however. It appears that Silverlight isnt even attempting to make a request and automatically throwing the exception.p
Negative 23896 pAm I correct in thinking that the QGraphics classes are not threadsafe I am porting an old app to Qt and in the process attempting to make it multithreaded too.

The problem I have is that as I am doing an enumeration algorithm of about 10m enumerations I want to parallelize it, therefore I created FutureTasks which each which evaluate a fraction of the 10m evaluations. The error I am getting isp  precodejava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 2147483648     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTaskSync.innerGetUnknown Source     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.getUnknown Source codepre  pWhich from what I gather from Google searches is caused when attempting to retrieve the result of a task that aborted by throwing an exception.p  pIs there some way to make this static method thread safe, like each thread making a its own copy of the global static arrays that are being editedp  pThanksp

Negative 23896 pI cant manage to make my code symbolicated ... I read the part below p  blockquote   pGiven a crash report, the matching   binary, and its .dSYM file,   symbolication is relatively easy. The   Xcode Organizer window has a tab for   crash reports of the currently   selected device. You can view   externally received crash reports in   this tab  just place them in the   appropriate directory. This is the   same as the Mac OS X directory   described in the first section. It   doesnt matter which device you have   tethered, but the directory in which   you place the crash report must be the   directory for the tethered and   selected device.p      pIt is not necessary to place the   binary and .dSYM file in any   particular location. Xcode uses   Spotlight and the UUID to locate the   correct files. It is necessary,   though, that both files be in the same   directory and that this directory is   one that is indexed by Spotlight.   Anywhere in your home directory should   be fine.p blockquote  pBut it doesnt work for me ... here is what I did p  ul liI opened xcode organizer and I had my iphone device with crash logsli liApp and dsym files are in my xcode project which is on my desktopli ul  pAll the rest should be automatic, right  but crash logs arent symbolicated yet ...p  pAny comments welcome.p  pCheers.p  pGotye.p
Negative 23896 pPlease suggest how should I approach these requirements. What readytouse solutions modules are best suited to achieve something like thisp  pWhat I need is an image library that has searchable, tagged images that are already resized when we publish them. If the author searches the library and the image he needs isnt there, he can upload one and have it added to the index. The important thing is that images in the library can be sorted into three categories News images, top story images and feature images so that, over time, we dont end up with hundreds of images crammed into one folder, thus making browsing a pain and to prevent someone from something like Searching for a keyword so they can find an image for the news, picking an image, and then seeing its 1600X. 1200. Also, I need something which will assemble thumbnail galleries easily. I dont want to have to go to the image library, get a URL, go back, paste it in, etc. I should be able to pick, say, 8 images and say create gallery. How this objective is achieved is flexible, but I am looking for a shortcut to get around assembling screenshot galleries by hand.p

Negative 23896 pOn a Ruby on Rails development environment, a page will be shown after 30 seconds on Firefox, but takes 90 seconds on IE 8 with IE 7 Compatibility Mode.p  pFurther investigation shows that it should be Javascript that slowed down the page, because if Javascript is turned off, then the page content will also show in 30 seconds.p  pBecause there are probably 7 or 8 jQuery plugins, Facebook scripts, and Google Analytics script, it would take quite some time to move all the Javascript code to the end of the HTML file, which should speed up the page content view so that content is shown after 30 seconds, just like Firefox, is there a way to force IE to show page content before finish executing all the Javascript codep  pI think IE might be waiting for all Javascript code to finish first, because what if there are codedocument.writecode statements, which should be within the HTML... Firefox or Chrome doesnt wait for that but display the content right away.p  pon the production server, the page will be displayed on Firefox after 5 to 7 seconds, because a lot of the partials HTML subcomponents are cached.  IE 8 takes a lot longer too, about 40 seconds or so.p  pstrongP.S.strong  A strong reason why the Javascript is embedded throughout the HTML may be that, say if there is an Image Carousel, then the HTML code is in a partial, which is an HTML file generated by an HAML file, and all the HTML as well as the Javascript code are in this file, for better encapsulation, instead of having HTML in one file, and the Javascript in another file, but I wonder what if all these Javascript code blocks only use jQuerys codedocument.readyfunction  ... code, then will these code block slow down the page display on IEp
Negative 23896 pI want to try to implement the Tetris Game using TDD.p  pFrom what Ive come to understand when reading a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0321503627Growing ObjectOriented Software, Guided by Testsa, I should start by defining what would be my Acceptance tests. If I am right, Acceptance tests when doing TDD are defined just like Use Cases.p  pIt is of great importance to define a good first Acceptance Test that will work as skeleton of the App, so it should be kind of simple.p  pIve choosen the following 2 Acceptance Tests as my first to implementp  ol liThe Game starts and the Player closes it.li liThe Game starts and the Player does nothing. He eventually loses.li ol  pAre these 2 acceptance tests good starting tests What would be good next acceptance tests I could think of something likep  ul liThe game starts and only square pieces drop. The player puts them all in such a way that the lines always explode, making the Game after 100 gamesteps still be not over.li ul  pbut I feel this is kind of awkward, as in a real Tetris game you would always have different pieces falling, and that is what Acceptance Testing should be about.p  pAlso, I feel kind of tempted to just try to implement everything in one go when doing 2, which I think is not one pretends when implementing the second Acceptance Test. I guess the idea would be to only have the game implemented after like 67 of them, not on the second. Am I rightp  pThanksp

As you can see I use Miscellaneous.CopyStreamsrc, dest which is a basic stream copier, as I cant get src.CopyTodest to work at all, so any hints on that is welcome as well.p  pBelow is a link to the whole VS2010 project if you would like to look at it more closely a hrefhttpwww.diredumplings.comSerializationTesting.zip relnofollowhttpwww.diredumplings.comSerializationTesting.zipap  pUPDATEp  pstrongTheSmalleststrong I tried using the Compress method you posted on my serializationp  precodeBinaryFormatter bf  new BinaryFormatter             using MemoryStream stream  new MemoryStream                              bf.Serializestream, profile                  byte[] array  Compressstream                  using MemoryStream ms  new MemoryStreamarray                                      using FileStream fs  File.Createpath                                              ms.WriteTofs                         fs.Flush                                                    codepre  pHowever, it seems to give me the same problems that I had with srcStream.CopyTodestStream earlier, which is that it doesnt seem to get written to the stream.

I know that ojbc14.jar is catered towards java 1.4. But thankfully we never saw any issue while using this with 1.5 version. Another reason for not moving to ojbc5 was the fact that we did not see ojdbc5.jar in the installed oracle 10g at all.p  pWe have upgraded our DB to be 11g now and I did not see ojdbc14.jar. Does this mean we have to move to ojdbc5.jarp  pWe are willing to make the change. But can the people who made the switch confirm if they saw any issue when they changed the JDBC driver to ojdbc5.jar from ojdbc14.jarp  pRelated to it, it would be good if someone can elaborate little more about dms flavors of this jar and how it is to be used.p

The Error code is commonly 0x9c, sometimes 0x19. Others told me that system memory may be corrupted, but its very unlikely since all 2003x64based servers are experiencing that problems. The Windows error log lists three error messages of type WDMxWMI, without any further details, before the system reboots because of an bluescreen.p  pI dont know why this happens, and I neither know if, or how my program could be the reason for that, since Im using the WMI exacly like the MSDN examples told me. Last but not least, it works absolutely fine on 2008based servers.p  pIll be thankful for any advice.p

Negative 23896 pI am trying to create a small web application to interact with the Asterisk telephony platform.  There is a lot of similiar stuff out there but I want the learning experience of making my own.p  pHere is what I have now A simple python script that allows someone to interact with the manager interface via the command line. Basically how the script works is 1 Connects to the Asterisk Manager Interface. 2 Gets two phone numbers from the user on the CLI. 3 Originates the two calls 4 Brings the originated calls into a common meetme conference. 5 A while loop waits for input from the user. Only characters az are allowed. 6 az correspond to .WAV files that are played or injected into the conference by the use of originating another local extension.p  pTo me it is kinda neat and now I want to do the same exact thing from a web app but I dont know where to start. What languages would I need to use I know basic html and have played with javascript. What techniques would be required to pass form input variables to the python script on the server web server and asterisk server are the same machine CGI What about using PHP I will probably need to learn that at somepoint... If I use PHP can I still call the python script and pass values to it I was hoping to use javascript eventually to allow the user to play a sound that corresponds to a button just like a character in the command line version without hitting submit but plan on just getting it to work for now. I guess this question is also turning into Should I just learn PHP and drop the python I feel that I could really add to my current telephony skillset and have fun... this Asterisk stuff is a blast by being able to build web based tools that interact with Asterisk maybe Freeswitch too.  p  pAny hints or guidance would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 23896 pHow to import CSVTSV data to Couch DBp
Negative 23896 pWe have an application which acts as a touchscreen overlay. It provides custom touchscreen keyboards and numeric pads which sit over the top of other applications which require keyboard entry.p  pIt is written as a standalone VB6 ActiveX EXE and provides a COM interface for applications to request keyboards etc be displayed when needed. Button presses are fed back to the applications from the touch server using the SendInput API.p  pIve been asked to look at reworking this overlay using WPF but also to look at improving the link between the overlay and the applications that use it. As well as individual keypresses we also want to be able to have buttons representing things like URLs or product codes.p  pThe new overlay will be written in C using WPF, the applications that will use it are all written in VB6. Im looking for suggestions on how best to implement twoway communications between them.p  pMy first thought was to host a WCF service in the overlay and use callback contracts. Applications would register with the overlay and receive notifications related to the overlay button pushes through the callback contract.p  pThe clients are all VB6 applications though and so will require the use of a proxy dll to wrap up the service interface. I can allow the clients to registerunregister through this interface but Im unsure how to implement the callbacks using a proxy.p  pAlso the client application and overlay may be running for some time, how do I ensure that the communication is persistent and stablep  pId appreciate any input you might have regarding any potential problemssolutions related to this approach. Alternatively if you think WCF is the wrong choice here Id be happy to consider other optionsp

Negative 23896 pI have an ASP.NET application and I think I am running into a timing issue.  I have a control on a webform that will call some Javascript on the OnClientClick and also call code behind via serverside onClick. I click the button a print button in my instance and I call Javascript prompt to enter a reason for the print.  I enter whatever and then in the JS I call an ashx handler page via AJAX passing the results of the prompt. p  pThe handler then places the Text from the prompt into a session variable.  Once the JS is done the OnClick code behind is called calling a method that will grab the reason from the session variable after the ashx has written it and log the info and print.p  pWhat I am seeing is the very first time I do this I get an error my reason not found ie. session variable is null.  It works every time after that.  So, what I believe is happening is the first time the ASHX page is being called, it is being compiledloaded and not adding info to the session fast enough.p  pMy question is there a clean way to slow down my print function and give the JS call time to completep

Negative 23896 pIm working on a project that has several Silverlight application islands spread through out our ASP.Net web application. Weve decided to put all of our images in the ClientBinSilverlightImages directory on the server and not to embed them in the XAP or the DLL. The images may be reused and this would decrease the size of our XAPs, plus its more of a lazy load of the images which has its benefits. This has resulted in multiple http requests and sometimes blank areas until the image is loaded.p  pIf you run the tool a hrefhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comyslow relnofollowYSlowa from Yahoo, it mentions using image sprites to speed up your page loading. I want that same result for Silverlight. Is there a good approach to using image sprites as YSlow suggests in Silverlight Or is there another approach, such as zipping similar files and then extracting it on the cilent Im also thinking about when the performance gains would start kicking in... 5 requests, 10, 20p

Negative 23896 pI created a file upload service using Spring MVC with apache commons multipart resolver support which specifies that a file should be attached as part of a multipart HTTP Post request. The request also contains a parameter containing an XML string with metadata about the object. The XML can be marshalled using JAXB.p  pOther services that are not multipart handle the marshalling transparently, e.g.p  precodeRequestMappingvalue  register, method  RequestMethod.POST     ResponseStatusHttpStatus.CREATED     public ModelAndView createUserRequestBody CreateUserDTO createUserDTO throws Exception          UserDTO user  userService.createUsercreateUserDTO         return createModelAndViewuser      codepre  pHere CreateUserDTO is a JAXB annotated object which is automatically marshalled.

Negative 23896 pI have been very puzzled about the concept of model entity persistence in Symfony2. AFAIK, there is nothing like modelinstancesave in Symfony2.

However, I do not know how I can create a Blog factory to also save these tags and categories, instead I must return these Tag and Category instances from a factory which it wont persist anyway  there is no way I can persist the blog and persist the tags and categories all within a single method in the Blog.li ul  pIn fact, if I want to write a script that is invoked periodically to persist models, it seems impossible, because it must invoke the controller, and yet I dont see why a script requires a web server to be present, but not just work on the object model without touching the web server.p  pI really appreciate how to resolve the problems above.

Negative 23896 pFirst some background, p  pI am currently working on a relatively large Asp.Net MVC application that I have tried, as much as possible, to design around a domain driven model, using good design principles. We are required to do all database access via stored procedures Oracle.  In this application, I have a variety of controllers that use service objects to do business logic and in turn call on repository objects to accomplish access.  p  pI have just been informed that the dba requires several common parameters to be passed to every stored procedure in addition to the parameters required to fetchupdateinsert the data.  These parameters include the username, ip address and domain of the user making the original web request.  This data is then used in by each stored procedure to call functions that log access and check that the user has permissions to execute that particular stored procedure.p  pI have tried to gently explain that I feel this is poor design and that the .Net application could simply call stored procedures dedicated to logging and checking permissions whenever necessary.  Unfortunately, this methodology is well established in the environment and the dba is unwilling to change it.p  pSo now to my question,p  pDoes anyone have any good ideas on how I can accomplish retrieving these extra parameters and deliver them to the repository objects without making a huge mess  From what I can tell this data is only available from the web context when in the controller layer.  This means passing the extra data to class in the service layer and then on to each repository class.  Id like to minimize the pain here as much as possible.p

Negative 23896 pI have a Windows Forms application. It loads assemblies with the extension .Plugin.dll with Assembly.LoadFile. One of these plugins calls into another assembly dll. That dll eventually throws a ValidationException exception. The method that throws the exception is in a class that inherits from IDataErrorInfo. This class is a class that is contained in a Linq to SQL class .dbml. In the plugin I call DataContext.SubmitChanges. This is wrapped in a trycatch block. This causes my business logic to validate the data before submitting to the database in the OnValidate override. The result that I see is that after the ValidationExeption is thrown, the debugger stops at the bottom of the OnValidate method indicating that an unhandled exception has occured. If I continue to run the app my catch block is executed. That is what I wanted in the first place, but why am i getting an unhandled exception when it truly is handledp

Negative 23896 pI am attempting to do some dynamic loading that includes javascript, css, and html files.p  pI would like to do it like thisp  precode.when.ajaxhtmlPath, .getcssPath, .ajax     url javascriptPath,     dataType text  .donefunctionresponse  i want to pass the data for each of these to the respective functions             appendHtmlwhat goes here            appendCsswhat goes here     executeJswhat goes here  .failfunction     console.logfailed  codepre  pSo Im confused on how I separate out the response callbacks. Currently, the response object you see in my .done function is ONLY the HTML file which I called.  This function is making the correct ajax calls, and the correct files are all being responded by the server, but how do I access them once ALL the calls are complete  Need this so I wont be applying cssjs to HTML which is not there yet, etc. Also, what I do is have the javascript file returned as a string and then i eval it within the executeJs function. My understanding is that this is an okay use of eval because its the file being returned by our own server so I dont see how it could be tampered with.

My goal is create an software that allows me to organize those files and folders relating description and tags to them, without affecting the correspondig physical files in the disk. But for now Im facing a logical problem How do I make a direct connection between that physical file and the database register I want that, even if the physical file, for some reason, is edited or moved to another folder inside the root directory, the software is still able to relate that file with its original register in the database.p  pMy first idea was to use a checksum hash to identify every file but, Im guessing that if the file is edited, so does the hash, doesnt it Besides that, I also think that a folder itself cant be checked that way.p  pAnother solution that came up to my mind was applying a unique key in the beginning of every file and folder name in the directory. That may work, but it seems to me like an improvised solution and, therefore, Imhoping that there may be another way to do it that I havent considered yet. Does anyone have an advice on thatp

When programming in other languages, paths are used to find libraries, e.g. codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode, codePYTHONPATHcode, codePERLLIBcode, codeRUBYLIBcode, codeCLASSPATHcode, codeNODEPATHcode, but Ive never had to stop and think about how that could be insecure.p  pIn fact, codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode has a hrefhttpxahlee.orgUnixResourcedirldpath.htmlWhy codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode is bada to discourage its use. The Ruby and Perl library path environment variables are ignored if their security mechanisms are invoked, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma147611290123codeSAFEcodea and a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperlrun.htmlPERL5LIBcodeTcode taint modea respectively.p  pMy thoughts so far...p  ul liThe user could set codeTOOLSPATHLIBRARYcode to a library of their choosing, but the utility will run under their uid. They could simply run their malicious library directly with codebashcode.li liMy tools codesudocode some things. Someone could set their codeTOOLSPATHLIBRARYcode to something that takes advantage of this. But, the tools are not run via codesudocode, they only invoke codesudocode here and there. The user would have to be a codesudoercode in any case, they could just call codesudocode directly.li liIf I cant trust codeTOOLSPATHLIBRARYcode, then I cant trust codePATHcode. All program invocations must use absolute paths.li liIve seen shell programs use aliases for programs that are absolute, so that instead of calling codelscode, use a variable, like codeLSbinlscode. From what Ive read, this is to protect against users redefining program defaults as aliases. See a hrefhttpwww.linuxquestions.orgquestionslinuxsecurity4pathfunctionsandsecuritybashscriptingbestpractices903048PATH, functions and security. Bash scripting best practices. a.li liPerls a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperlsec.htmlTaintmodetaint modea treats all environment variables as tainted, which foreboding, which is why Im trying to reason about the risks of environment.li liIt is not possible for one users to change anothers environment, unless that user is root.

Negative 23896 pIve been implementing a grid view of some content   and I have it implemented as a genuine unordered list to get a nice block, visual look. Now Im being tasked to implement the same data, but as a table. There are actions you can do on this data as well. The figure is meant to show switching, but the lists can be longer.p  blockquote   pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAA5m4.png altGridTable Viewp blockquote  pNow, I have a sense that I could use the existing unordered list structure, and add elements to it and then fake a table view, which actually doesnt seem that much harder. Or I could do it the other way, change everything to a table view then implement the grid view with CSS.p  pMy question is, what are some approaches to do this I could double up my markup  implementing both, and then switching between.

Judging by the dependencies appearing in the various Kconfig files, I believe Ive done everything correctly, but I cant seem to prevent kconf from discarding codeCONFIGISIFcode and codeCONFIGVPFECAPTUREcode.p  pMy very ugly alternative is to go in and start manually hacking makefiles. That works to pick up the modules I want, but its obviously inconsistent with the design and intent of the Kconfig system, and would break any tools like make gconfig.p  pmake has a d verbosity flag that explains how it is processing dependencies.

Negative 23896 pSo Im trying to place a Kinect driven model on a known ground plane such that his feet do not go below the ground.  Im using the Kinect SDK sample setup, the Dude.FBX model, and using the SkeletonJointsSensorOffsetCorrection class to move the model off the floor based on the Kinect sensor floor plane.  This works pretty well and allows me to jump, which is pretty important.  However, when I bend my knees to squat down a little, the model applies a constraint filter to prevent the joints from bending too far.  This meas that the hip moves down properly, but the models legs dont bend all the way like mine are, so the feet clip through the floor since they have to go somewhere.p  pWhat I want to do is alter the positions and rotations of the models feetknees after all other filters are run so that they dont go through the ground plane.  However, Im stuck on two pointsp  ol liHow do I ask the model not the Kinect Skeleton if its feet are below a certain Yli liHow do move the feet up to 0 and rotate the knee and hip joints to be somewhat natural again, on the model, not the Kinect Skeletonli ol  pThe Kinect Skeleton is correct.  Its seeing everything in the right place.  But the model interprets that info in a way that I want to adjust after the fact.  I just dont know the best way to go about it.  Any ideasp  pThanks, everyone.p

Negative 23896 pDear Stackoverflow community,p  pi have a pretty wierd problem. First of all i built some kind of a chooser activity, which is nothing more than a WheelView on the left side, a Coverflow in the center and another smaller coverflow beneath that. Btw. a CoverFlow is a Gallery with some logic overridden.p  pThe center coverflow uses a BaseAdapter. Ive created some set of Lists and each time my coverflow gets new content, i create a new instance of BaseAdapter with one of the lists. In my case this is done, when selecting an item in the lower CoverFlow. So i implemented an OnItemSelectedListener, to check when that happens. Scrolling this coverflow causes the view to notifyDataSetChanged always and change the adapter in some case. Now this works like a charm.p  pAs i have lots of objects in this chooser the center coverflow, i decided to continue using a CursorAdapter to increase performance. Now the CursorAdapter doesnt seem to have a notifyDataSetChanged method, so i copied the same codelogic as the BaseAdapter and used this in mine. The lower Coverflow still uses the same adapter in this case a ListAdapter, implementing a SpinnerAdapter. Now  when doing the exact same logic, the lower coverflow recenters itself after each notifyDataSetChanged call on the center CoverFlowAdapter. I seriously dont get it. I will not post the whole logic here, as that would be about 5 classes, but the point in question is this onep  precode   private OnItemSelectedListener itemSelListener  new OnItemSelectedListener      Override     public void onItemSelectedAdapterViewltgt arg0, View arg1, int arg2,             long arg3            ifselectedByClicking             switchModelTypearg1.getId                            private void switchModelTypeint id     int oldMode  mode     mode  id     forint i  0 i lt currentColors.length i         ifcurrentColors[i]  null         currentColors[i].isSelected  false          ifcurrentColors[mode]  null     currentColors[mode].isSelected  true     ifcoverFlow.getAdapter  null         SelectionObjectCursorAdapter                  coverFlow.getAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged                       ifdecorIsWooden                           checkIfWoodDecorAdapteroldMode        codepre  pThe lower CoverFlow is not touched at any point in this part of code, nor is it anywhere in the class.p

Negative 23896 pWe have few very big tables  3 tables, each 2  5 GB in our MySQL DB.

Negative 23896 pI am new to Ocaml and trying to write some small example application. I am using codeocamlccode version 3.11.2 under Linux Ubuntu 10.04.

Also, when compiling a file that uses definitions from another file, I have to tell the compiler in which code.cmicode file to find the external definitions.p  pSo my idea was to usep  precodeocamlc i c a.ml gt a.mli ocamlc c a.mli b.ml ocamlc o b a.cmo b.cmo codepre  pThe first step works and produces files codea.mlicode and codea.cmocode, but when running the second step I getp  precodeFile b.ml, line 1, characters 2831 Error Unbound value foo codepre  pwhere codefoocode is a function that is defined in codea.mlcode and called in codeb.mlcode.p  pSo my question is how can I compile each source file separately and specify the interfaces to be imported on the command line I have been looking in the documentation and as far as I can understand I have to specify the code.mlicode files to be included, but I do not know how.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere some more details.

Negative 23896 pIve been devolving several Magento modules on a Macs local Apache server. Lately, Ive moved the modules to a new Magento install on a new server. My problem is that all but one is 404ing when Im trying to load their admin pages. I cant find any reason why this one module works and the others dont even try to load pages. Most if the code is very similar from one to the next. Also, the 404 pages are not helpful and there are no exception or log entries to help me. These all work on the old server, and although some of the code has badold links that need to be fixed, and those generate errors I see no reason they arent trying to load pages and generating errors.p  pI think the configs work, because I get the admin menu.

Negative 23896 pOr to be specific, why do we use foldr to encode lists and iteration to encode numbersp  pSorry for the longwinded introduction, but I dont really know how to name the things I want to ask about so Ill need to give some exposition first. This draws heavily from a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orgpipermailhaskellcafe2010May078251.htmlthis C.A.McCann posta that just not quite satisfies my curiosity and Ill also be handwaving the issues with rankntypes and infinite lazy things.p  hr  pOne way to encode datatypes as functions is to create a pattern matching function that receives one argument for each case, each argument being a function that receives the values corresponding to that constructor and all arguments returning a same result type.p  pThis all works out as expected for nonrecursive typesp  precodeencoding data Bool  true  False type Bool r  r gt r gt r  true  Bool r true  ct cf gt ct  false  Bool r false  ct cf gt cf  encoding data Either a b  Left a  Right b type Either a b r  a gt r gt b gt r gt r  left  a gt Either a b r left x  cl cr gt cl x  right  b gt Either a b r right y  cl cr gt cr y codepre  pHowever, the nice analogy with pattern matching breaks down with recursive types. We might be tempted to do something likep  precodeencoding data Nat  Z  S Nat type RecNat r  r gt RecNat gt r gt r zero  cz cs gt cz succ n  cz cs gt cs n   encoding data List a  Nil  Cons a List a type RecListType a r  r gt a gt RecListType gt r gt r nil  cnil ccons gt cnil cons x xs  cnil ccons gt ccons x xs codepre  pbut we cant write those recursive type definitions in Haskell The usual solution is to force the callback of the conssucc case to be applied to all levels of recursion instead of just the first one ie, writing a folditerator. In this version we use the return type codercode where the recursive type would bep  precodeencoding data Nat  Z  S Nat type Nat r  r gt r gt r gt r zero  cz cf gt cz succ n  cz cf gt cf n cz cf   encoding data List a  Nil  Cons a List a type recListType a r  r gt a gt r gt r gt r nil  z f gt z cons x xs  z f gt f x xs z f codepre  pWhile this version works, it makes defining some functions much harder. For example, writing a tail function for lists or a predecessor function for numbers is trivial if you can use pattern matching but gets tricky if you need to use the folds instead.p  pSo onto my real questionsp  ol lipstrongHow can we be sure that the encoding using folds is as powerful as the hypothetical pattern matching encodingstrong Is there a way to take an arbitrary function definition via pattern matching and mechanically convert it to one using only folds instead If so, this would also help make tricky definitions such as tail or foldl in terms of foldr as less magicalpli lipstrongWhy doesnt the Haskell type system allow for the recursive types needed in the pattern matching encodingstrong. Is there a reason for only allowing recursive types in datatypes defined via codedatacode Is pattern matching the only way to consume recursive algebraic datatypes directly Does it have to do with the type inferencing algorithmpli ol

Negative 23896 pIm trying to create an application using Ruby on Rails that allows a user to download all of the songs that they have uploaded.  At this point Ive authenticated the user using OmniAuth, and Ive managed to pull some data using Soundclouds Ruby a hrefhttpsgithub.comsoundcloudsoundcloudruby relnofollowinterfacea with their API.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpdevelopers.soundcloud.comdocsapireferencetracks relnofollowAPIa, every track has an associated title, artworkurl, and downloadurl I have already used the API to get this information.  Id like to display each song showing its title and artwork if any exists, and then if they choose to download that track, theyll be able to click a button and download that track from the downloadurl.p  pSo heres what Ive realized for most tracks or sounds, as they are called in Soundcloud, downloading is disabled by default when you upload it.  The thing is, there is also an option that says Apps EnabledDisabled.  What Im wondering is if downloading for a song is disabled, can a 3rd party application that has been authenticated still use the download URL to grab the track  Id like to know if users will need to individually go through all their tracks and enable downloading in order for this to work.p  pIf you need any more detail, please say so.  Apologies if this is an obvious question.p  pThanks,p  pNatp

Id love to do this in a really elegant and modularized way, but Im having a hard time figuring out how.p  pConsider a view thats a task list each iteration of the generating loop adds a codepretaskcode and codeposttaskcode call on either end, which builds the interactive pieces on either end of the task title Complete checkbox, comments link, etc. Now, when the system detects and includes the plugin file codeplugintimetracking.phpcode, the plugin should add functionality to posttask  adding a track time button in addition to everything else.p  pWhat Id like to accomplish is making the plugin hook onto pretask or posttask  let it do all the legwork by attaching itself to the proper functions and extending them, instead of having the core sort plugins and herd their functions to the right places. Does PHP offer such functionality Am I going about this the wrong way Let me know if I need to clarify at all  thanks for the helpp

Negative 23896 pI have used Flash Builder and previously Flash for at least the past 15 years and am looking at the writing on the wall concerning the demise of Flash based software. I find ActionScript3 to be a powerful and elegant programming language and am hesitant to move towards what I perceive html5 to be because it appears that the underlying programming language is like taking a step back in time. It does not appear to be fully object oriented and I have yet to see a sophisticated IDE for it. Also, I have not seen an html5 equivalent of the Flash media server to capture and deliver video. Im not a professional developer, Im a college professor who does a lot of design and development work and I need a platform that will be around for a while, that is technologically advanced, and that will continue to evolve. Ive worked with xCode, but am concerned that it it too limited to IOS. Id like to hear from others who can guide me in my decision making. p

And whenever there is a need to validate the user role, I compare the value stored in the session against a constant say ADMINROLE.

Negative 23896 pLet me start by describing the scenario. I have an MVC 3 application with SQL Server 2008. In one of the pages we display a list of Products that is returned from the database and is UNIQUE per logged in user. The SQL query actually a VIEW used to return the list of products is VERY expensive.p  ul liIt is based on very complex business requirements which cannot be changed at this stage.li liThe database schema cannot be changed or redesigned as it is used by other applications.li liThere are 50k products and 5k users each user may have access to 1 up to 50k products.li ul  pIn order to display the Products page for the logged in user we usep  precodeSELECT TOP X  FROM [VIEW] WHERE UserID  UserId  where X is the size of the page codepre  pThe query above returns a maximum of 50 rows maximum page size. The WHERE clause restricts the number of rows to a maximum of 50k products that the user has access to. The page is taking about 5 to 7 seconds to load and that is exactly the time the SQL query above takes to run in SQL. strongProblemstrongp  pThe user goes to the Products page and very likely uses paging, resorts the results, goes to the details page, etc and then goes back to the list. And every time it takes 57s to display the results.p  pThat is unacceptable, but at the same time the business team has accepted that the first time the Products page is loaded it can take 57s. Therefore, we thought about strongCACHINGstrong.p  pWe now have two options to choose from, the most obvious one, at least to me, is using .Net Caching in memory  in proc. Please note that Distributed Cache is not allowed at the moment for technical constraints with our provider  hosting partner.p  pBut Im not very comfortable with this. We could end up with lots of products in memory when there are 50 or 100 users logged in simultaneously which could cause other issues on the server, like .Net constantly removing cache items to free up space while our code inserts new items.p  pThe strongSECONDstrong optionp  pThe main problem here is that it is very EXPENSIVE to generate the User x Product x Access view, so we thought we could create a flat table or in other words a CACHE of all products x users in the database. This table would be exactly the result of the view. However the results can change at any time if new products are added, user permissions are changed, etc. So we would need to constantly refresh the table which could take a few seconds and this started to get a little bit complex.p  pSimilarly, we though we could implement some sort of Cache Provider and, upon request from a user, we would run the original SQL query and select the products from the view 57s, acceptable only once and save that result in a flat table called ProductUserAccessCache in SQL. Next request, we would get the values from this cachedtable as we could easily identify the results were cached for that particular user with a fast query without calculations in SQL. Any time a product was added or a permission changed, we would truncate the cachedtable and upon a new request the table would be repopulated for the requested user. It doesnt seem too complex to me, but what we are doing here basically is creating a NEW cache provider.p  ul liDoes any one have any experience with this kind of issueli liWould it be better to use .Net Caching in procli liAny suggestionsli ul

Negative 23896 pI am actually working on application where a client depends on modules that needs to be downloaded from a repository server. The modules can be of any archive  jar, dll, zip, etc.p  pThe client first submits a set of properties a set of KeyValue already defined by the server to the repository server. The server makes some computation based on those properties and return all modules correspond to the client. if the client needs a module that is outdated, the server will send the newest modules to the client so it can updates it. The server will also need to compute dependencies between modules and sent them to the client, like maven.p  pBut, the main difficulty is I cannot make assumption about the properties sent by the client because will they are specific to the client environment. p  pThe first idea that I had, was to a have matrix where each column represents a property and each row represents a module. In the matrix, it would be posible to add and remove properties. And for each case in the matrix, I will add the value that corresponds for that module. p  pFor instance, let say that I have 2 modules and a set of properties codeOS, Archive, Arch, Version, .Netcode. For module1, the values are codeOSWindows 7, Archivedll, Arch32bits, Version2.0.0,.net3.5code. For module2, the values are codeOSWindows 7, Archivejar, Version2.1,.net4.0code p  pBut this case works perfectly for if each property contains only one value. If the client says I want all the modules that works on Windows 7 codemodule1code and codemodule2code and runs on a but but for which codedllcode archive supports version of superior of .net 3.5, . codemodule1code will be returned. p  pThats work perfectly. p  pBut what if each property can contain multiple values which is our case. For instance, in our previous example, if module1 can run in Windows 7, Vista, XP. For the OS property, I will have to go for each property sent by the client and search for the correct value. Thats a combinatorial calculation. p  pWhat I see in this process is very similar to a package management system, like apt, yum. p  pWhat is the better approach to this problemp
Negative 23896 pIm new to the whole Backbone and Im actually not much of a JavaScript programmer yet, and Im running into issues with a filter form.p  pBasically I have a database that my backbone collection gets populated from. On the page, there is a filter section where I can checkmark things such as Jobstatus Running, Completed, Failed, etc... Or input such as User name test0. All that works great until I started paginating my results.p  pI have a router set up to handle pagepage. This works as well, say I go to page 2 with no filters checked, and then on page 2 I check some filters which right now sets my results back to page 1 by using navigatepage1, when I hit my back button, I go back to page 2 since that is where my no filter results were last on, but my filter box is still checked. p  pSo if there are 10 rows per page and I have 14 results with no filters. I go to page 2 to see results 1114, check a filter that returns me to page 1 with a total of 5 results, and then i hit back. I am now on page 2 of those filtered results seeing rows 115 of 5...p  pIs there anyway for the history to remember the form checkboxes and other inputs So if I hit back in the situation I describe, it goes to page 2, but with the form filters removes as they were prior.p  pI was thinking Id have to use routes for every value on the form... but hoping there is a better way of doing this hopefully without rewriting the entire code as well.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pI have two main views for input one tied to the filter form, one for the pagination selection. The filter form view calls another view for the results which is ties to a collection of rows.p  pHere is the filter form viewp  precode var FilterForm  Backbone.View.extend             events                  submit refreshData,                 change input refreshData             ,             initialize function                   this.refreshData             ,              refreshData function                   Backbone.history.navigatepage1                 pageNumberModel.setpageNumber, 1                  this.newPage             ,             newPage function                   var pageNumber  pageNumberModel.getpageNumber                 var rowsPerPage  pageNumberModel.getrowsPerPage                 var startRow  pageNumber  rowsPerPage  rowsPerPage  1                 var endRow  startRow  rowsPerPage  1                  startrow.valstartRow                 endrow.valendRow                  var inputData  this.el.serializeArray                 var inputDatareduced  inputData.reducefunction acc, field                      acc[field.name]  field.value                     return acc                                   .getDatabase.aspx, inputData, function outputData                      jobQueueRows.set.parseJSON.parseJSONoutputData[JobQueue]                     jobQueueRowsView.render                      pageNumberModel.set.parseJSON.parseJSONoutputData[Pagination]                     pageNumberView.render                     rowNumberView.render                                        codepre

Negative 23896 pIm working on a jQuery image carouselrotator, and Ive gotten stuck. Normally, I use Bootstrap for my carousels, and Id be happy to do so again  but this carousel has an extra function I dont think Bootstrap can handle. We use Smarty templates, so the carousel contents, and the number of items in the carousel are totally variable.p  pIve attached a graphic explaining what I would like to do. Section A on the graphic is a typical thumbnail and arrowbased carousel navigation. Section B is the current image in the carousel, which slides up from the bottom. Sections A and B are both working in Bootstrap. Section C is where Im running into troubles. I need to display captions, cycling through the three given containers as the carousel turns. I would prefer to have the captions move from top to bottom next caption and previous caption opposite of where I have drawn them, doh.p  pIf anyone knows of a plugin that can be setup or modified to do this, that would be great. Id also like to hear any ideas anyone has of how to do this custom. I guess adding classes like .active, .previous, and .next are one way to go, but Im not sure how to deal with the index starting over. Honestly, this is approaching the upper levels of my abilities, which is why I need an extra kick from you.p  pUnfortunately, Im not in a position to share my current BootstrapSmarty code with you  However, Id be happy to answer any questions you might have.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu3rCm.png altQuick sketch of my carousel dilemmap

I have created demonstration here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfhthD relnofollowjsFiddlea p  pCode jsp  precodetest  document.getElementByIdtest   test.onmouseover  function    this.style.backgroundColorblue      test.onmouseout  function    this.style.backgroundColorred      window.onkeyup  function    var test   document.getElementByIdtest   var test2  document.getElementByIdtest2   var f      var sp1  document.createElementdiv   var sp1content  document.createTextNodeTest       sp1.appendChildsp1content       sp1.innerHTML  Testltbr gtTest   sp1.id  test2     insertedElement  test.insertBeforesp1, test2    test2.style.height0px    replacedNode  test.replaceChildsp1, test2        test.innerHTML  Test     alert1   f  function      test.removeChildtest2       setTimeoutf,1000   codepre  pCode HTMLp  precodeltbodygt   ltdiv idtest stylebackgroundcolorredgt     ltdiv idtest2gt         Testltbr gtTestltbr gtTestltbr gtTestltbr gt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt  codepre  pWhen you hover over the element it changes color. When you are over it and press some button, the element is changed and mouse is not over it any more onmouseout event should be triggered. This workaround works in firefox, but not in chrome. Is there any way how to properly detect onmouseout I have read something about mutation events, however I would consider these as last resort as they have performance impact. As I am not using any framework yet, I would like not to use it just to resolve this ridiculous issue. Usecase for this is custom dropdown menu with variable height with search functionality which has some onmouseoveronmouseout styling changes similar to native select field. p

Any suggestions for optimizing the speed of receiving the string something like Sc48E from JavaScript, parsing it into a char unfortunately this is required and sending it to the serial portp  pThanks for your inputp  pUsing jUART a hrefhttpsgithub.combillhsujUART relnofollowhttpsgithub.combillhsujUARTap  pemstrongC Codeemstrongp  pSerialAPI.hp  precodevoid sendmulticonst stdstringamp msg      io.postboostbindampSerialAPIdomultisend, this, msg   void domultisendconst stdstringamp msg codepre  pSerialAPI.cppp  precodevoid SerialAPIdomultisendconst stdstringamp msg       bool writeinprogress  sendmsg.empty  is there anything currently being written        char cMsg[5]   max length of incoming packets      forint i  0 i lt sLength i          cMsg[i]  msg[i]         sendmsg.pushbackcMsg[i]  store in write buffer this function requires a char          if writeinprogress  if nothing is currently being written, then start          sendmultistart    void SerialAPIsendmultistartvoid       boostasioasyncwriteserial,      boostasiobufferampsendmsg.front, 5,      boostbindampSerialAPIsendmulticomplete,      this,      boostasioplaceholderserror   codepre  pemstrongLogging Infoemstrongp  pIve added logging in SerialAPI.hp  precodevoid sendmulticonst stdstringamp msg      io.postboostbindampSerialAPIdomultisend, this, msg     FBLOGTRACEsendmulti, SerialAPI.hsendmulti works  codepre  p...and in SerialAPI.cppp  precodevoid SerialAPIdomultisendconst stdstringamp msg       bool writeinprogress  sendmsg.empty  is there anything currently being written      const char cMsg  msg.cstr       logging     FBLOGTRACEdomultisend, debug cMsg  ltlt cMsg      forint i  0 i lt 5 i          sendmsg.pushbackcMsg[i]  store in write buffer            if writeinprogress  if nothing is currently being written, then start      sendmultistart  codepre  pAnd this is the minimal output I getp  precode31 [2756] INFO FireBreath ltgt  ........srcPluginAutoWinnpwinmain.cpp29  NPInitialize  Initialization done 34 [2756] INFO FireBreath ltgt  ....srcNpapiCoreNpapiPluginModuleNPP.cpp150  FBNpapiNpapiPluginModuleNPPNew  NPPNew 02F60E30 37 [2756] INFO FireBreath ltgt  ....srcPluginCorePluginCore.cpp40  FBPluginCoresetPlatform  os 00D2E8B0 browser NPAPI 85 [2756] INFO FireBreath ltgt  ....srcNpapiCoreNpapiPluginModuleNPP.cpp208  FBNpapiNpapiPluginModuleNPPDestroy  NPPDestroy 02F60E30 15338 [2756] INFO FireBreath ltgt  ....srcNpapiCoreNpapiPluginModuleNPP.cpp150  FBNpapiNpapiPluginModuleNPPNew  NPPNew 02F60EB0 15340 [2756] INFO FireBreath ltgt  ....srcPluginCorePluginCore.cpp40  FBPluginCoresetPlatform  os 00D2E8B0 browser NPAPI codepre  pDo it seem as though I have everything set up right p  pOn another note, I cant debug the app for the life of me.

Negative 23896 pId like to know if its possible with any browser  dev tools to pick a specific value or closure variable while debugging and follow or watch it somehow into future execution points on the page. Basically, a memory profiler attached to just a single value, which would show during debugging or snapshots whether that value is still being retained either directly or indirectly. Alternatively, Id like to know if its possible to look at references in the memory profilersnapshot view in, say, Chrome, and tie those references to actual points in the source code.p  pMy problem is that I am debugging a memory leak caused by rebuilding a DOM tree for a portion of a fairly complex page. Even taking a very controlled memory snapshot that just looks at a single redraw removing the old DOM tree and adding a new one, where I know that Im  unintentionally retaining a reference to a small part of the old one, there are still hundreds of objects to look through, and to be quite honest I find the memory profiler in Chrome to be very confusing to navigate through. And even when I find references that might be of interest, Im at a loss as to how to tie them to points in the code  its great to know that Im retaining an HTMLDivElement somewhere but that could be almost any of the files...p  pSo basically, Im unsure how to proceed, and the two solutions Im asking about are the only things I can think of, if there is any way to do them. Sorry that this is such a vague question, I am open to other ways of tackling this as well.p

Negative 23896 pI have a drawable resource a png image for mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi. This image is used as background and based on its width I resize another bitmap and draw it over.p  pEverything works fine for mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi because my drawable folder for each density has the image. The problem occurs on different densities, for instance running on a Galaxy S4 with 1080p screenp  pHere is how I do itp  precodeGet the bitmap width  BitmapFactory.Options dimensions  new BitmapFactory.Options dimensions.inJustDecodeBounds  true BitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.drawable.icmarkervoid, dimensions         int width  dimensions.outWidth codepre  pWhat I have found on testing is that width is 80 pixels when running on a 720p screen BUT when running on a 1080p device the width is also 80 pixels. This is the same size as the png from xhdpi folder. p  pBUT actually the image is rendered scaled and correctly when I display it on the 1080p screen. So it does take the xhdpi image but it scales it before displaying it. As a sidenote the image is used as a map marker background.p  pMy question is how can I obtain the width of the image exactly how it will be rendered on the screen, not the size of it from the xhdpi folder p

Negative 23896 pIm doing a program in Struts2 that is parsing some xml from some list of urls and store the list of beans in HttpSession. This is a long running process, because it has to download xml from url, parse it, and create bean. I want to design this task such a manner so that when it will get request from client, it will start parsing and store the result in session. When it finishes parsing some xml it notify the page or Struts from java so that it able to show some results before all parsing the rest of url being completed. Im already using this parsing in different thread. But it has risk, because web manages different thread pool for each different client request and it has the possibility of memory leak. I already have a look in a hrefhttpwww.journaldev.com2296struts2execandwaitinterceptorexampleforlongrunningactions relnofollowexecAndWaita , but it is not possible to display some result bean during parsing process. Any one can tell better way or better solution. p

Negative 23896 pI have a Ubuntu server that has a few WordPress sites on it.  The hostname for the server is set to something like ipxxxxxxxxx.internal.  So when WordPress sends an email via PHP, via sendmail it uses that hostname in the EHLO command.  This causes some mail servers to reject the email.p  pI cant change the hostname for the server, and each site needs a different hostname anyway, so need a way to set this per website.  So I think that also rules out any php.ini changes or sendmailpostfix config changes.p  pI looked at WordPress plugins, but I think they all expect you to just use a different SMTP server relaying, and that isnt what I want.  I just want to use the current setup, but have it report the correct hostname for each site.p  pHopefully this is something easy I just overlooked... site needs to go live tomorrow.  Thank youp

Negative 23896 pI am using OpenLayers to connect to a homegrown server, and unlike professional grade servers like Google or Cloudmade that box will actually take a while to calculate the result for a specific tile. And as it is a mathematical function I am plotting, there is no big chance to accelerate the server or even prerender the tiles.p  pMy initial trials with Leaflet quickly came to the conclusion that Leaflet actually leaves all of the reloading and loaderror handling to the browser, while OpenLayers at least has an event that is fired when the tile server does return with an error code.p  pThe idea I am following was to basically start rendering a tile when it was requested and fire an HTTP 503 immediately, relying on the client to try again. p  pTo try again, I implemented a simple layer like thisp  precode    var myLayer  new OpenLayers.Layer.OSM.MYLayermine,          transparenttrue,         formatimagepng,         isBaseLayerfalse     myLayer.events.registertileerror, myLayer, function param           Try again         var targetURL  param.tile.layer.getURLparam.tile.bounds         var tile  param.tile         tile.timeout  tile.hasOwnPropertytimeout  tile.timeout  2  1000         setTimeoutfunction tileToLoad, url              if tileToLoad.url  url                  tileToLoad.clear                 tileToLoad.url  url                 tileToLoad.initImage                      .bindundefined, tile, targetURL, tile.timeout      codepre  pI figured out the code required to reload a tile from the source of OpenLayers, but maybe there is a cleaner way to accomplish this. p  pMy problem is The tiles themselves are reused, as are the divs in the DOM, so the reload procedure might actually try to reload a tile into a DIV that long as been successfully reused, e.g. because the user scrolled to someplace else where the server was able to provide data quickly.p  pThe question I guess boils down to  is there an official way to use the tileerror event to simply try to reloading, or at least a simpler way in the API to trigger a reload I spent quite a while in the source of OpenLayers itself but couldnt shed light on why it is still going wrong the test for tileToLoad.url  url didnt really do it.p  pThanks for your helpp

My problem is that, when i split vim window sp or vsp, I am unable to switch to another window.ctrlw ctrlw. It is obvious as most keyboard shortcuts, are not working in this integrated environment though commands are working fine. So it will be helpful if anybody give me command to switch window. p  pFor more details I tried wincmd R. It just switching position. But cursor remains in same position i.e. in old window. So its not useful. Is there any argument for wincmd to actual move focus from one window to anotherp  pThanks in andvance.p

In a high stress situation this is fraught with danger of factor 10 errors and such, so needs to be simple and straightforward.p  pRequirements  visually uncluttered  needs to work on most OSs and preferably older browsers. Ipad is a another user scenario  needs to validate input  needs to print reliably to A4 for the nurse to bring to drug prep area  needs to control layout on screen and on paperp  pRetrieval services offer interactive pdfs for this, such as this site.cats.nhs.ukwpcontentuploads201208dghdrugcalculatorv1.1.pdf p  pThis secures control of layout nicely, but layout and coding requires proprietary software and is quite laboursome and slow. I thought itd be cleaner to run it in something more web native. Ive toyed with embedding an interactive google sheet a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetpubkey0AiW9rByG5WusdC1jWnhHaDYwUzd0a0N5dHhnMmljOEEampgid1 relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetpubkey0AiW9rByG5WusdC1jWnhHaDYwUzd0a0N5dHhnMmljOEEampgid1a. Its still very rough, but you get the idea. The problem though is than an entered weight carries over to whoever accesses the site next which is unacceptable and accessing the sheet simultaneously would be disastrous.p  pI suppose a phpmysql kind of setup could sort out the interactive bid and populate a table, but honestly I wouldnt know where to start.p  pApart from a bit of JSHTMLCSS tutorials on codeacademy Im new at coding.p  pPrevious suggestions in another forum a hrefhttpsproductforums.google.comforummydiscussionsdocsQKc4T08QdXA relnofollowhttpsproductforums.google.comforummydiscussionsdocsQKc4T08QdXAap  pAny suggestionsp  pCheers, Madsp

to do the followingp  ul liappendObject element  appending the element at the end of the vectorli liclear  make the vector collection emptyli licontainsObject element  check whether the vector contains the elementli lielementAtint index  access the element at the given indexli liindexOfObject element  find the index of the elementli liinsertAtint index, Object element  insert the element at the given indexli liisEmpty  check whether the vector is emptyli liremoveAtint index  remove the element at the given indexli liremoveObject element  remove the element from the vectorli lireplaceint index, Object element  replace the element at the given index with the given elementli lisize  get the number of elements in the current vectorli liensureCapacityint minCapacity  make sure the vector gets at least the given capacityli liclone  returns a cloned copy of this vectorli liremoveRangeint fromIndex, int toIndex  removes from this vector all of the elements whose index is between fromIndex, inclusive and toIndex, exclusiveli litoString  returns a string representation of this vector, containing the String representation of each elementli lireverse  reverse the elements in this

So you add 1 to the D7 and it becomes D8 and at the end of the line the 44 subtracts one and becomes an 43. If the number at the end were to be 40, It would have to turn into 3F.p  pI do not have even the slightest clue of how to do this. All i really know is how to set the input and output files, but when it comes to manipulating the output file, Im not very knowledgeable. Also Im not sure how it will change since I am working with hex. p  pThank you all in advance for any help you may provide. It is very much appreciated. p
Negative 23896 pI have noticed something that happens only in Google Chrome when testing my HTML 5 slot games. When I minimise Chrome or even change to a different tab, it pauses my game. p  pSo for example, I will set it up to do 10 spins, then minimise the window. I can wait 5, 10, 15 minutes and it wont start playing until I maximise the window again.p  pI checked in Firefox, and the game plays in the background when minimised. Searching for this issue has come up with nothing at all, does anyone know a way to fix this Its super weird.p  pThanks Heatherp

Negative 23896 pIm trying to create a statistical learning algorithm that when trained will be able to classify two sets of data based on their differing content, judged by frequency of words used. I dont know if conditional probability i.e. frequency of one specific word occurring after another word matters that much here. Im not sure what algorithm would work for me best here SVM, neural net, etc., but ideally the library should be in Python, efficient, and easy to use. Input data for the learning algorithm should of course be strings.p  pAlthough Python is still preferred, I wouldnt mind using another language as long as it meets all the other criteria I need. Ill consider using basically any language as long as it also has a library for mySQL, and runs on Linux.p  pstrongEditstrong After thinking about it for a while, I think the general process Im going for now isp  ol liTokenize each item in the data set. The data set was an array of strings, now is an array of arrays of strings. tokensli liKeep a lexicon of tokens that are currently in the data setli liConvert my representations of strings to arrays of integers representing how many times each token in my lexicon occurs in each string.li liUse the arrays of integers to train the SVM instead of the raw strings themselves. li ol  pI dont know if there actually are any libraries out there that deal with raw strings for statistical learning in the way I want to deal with them, so I assume an array of integers wouldnt be an issue.p  pNote I would calculate the probabilities from my arrays of integers since the sum of everything in one array would be that arrays number of tokens, and then the probabilities are number of times token usednumber of tokens in stringp

Negative 23896 pSo I have this function codecart.removeitemidcode, that removes an item from the shopping cart using an ajax call. The codecartcode object is defined in its own javascript file and its functions are accessible and the coderemovecode function works properly to remove items as intended. Upon clicking the link below, an alert pops up, confirming if you really want to remove the item. If yes, it removes the item from the shopping cart.p  precodeif Model.Count gt 0      foreach var item in Model.Items              ltdivgtlta titleRemove item from cart hrefjavascriptcart.removeitem.ItemIDgtRemove Itemltagtltdivgt        codepre  pNow, due to complexity of the different types of items in the shopping cart, for a more user friendly UI, I need the confirmremoveitem alert text to be different, depending on the item that is clicked. I have a function defined in the model, codeGetRemoveItemAlertTextint itemidcode that returns the appropriate text. I wrap that text in a json object so that the text isnt visible as one of the coderemovecode functions parameters, when someone hovers over the link, in the browser statusbar.p  pThe javascript coderemovecode function has been redefined to coderemoveitemid, alerttextcode to display the custom remove text, instead of the same text every time. No other changes to that function it still displays an alert and removes the item if the user clicks yes to the confirmation. Here is my attempt at removing the item with the custom alert textp  precodeif Model.Count gt 0      foreach var item in Model.Items              var alert  Model.GetRemoveItemAlertTextitem.ItemID         ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             function removeItemitem.ItemID                  var bodytext  UriEscapeDataStringalertText                 var alerttext                       bodytext bodytext                              cart.removeitem.ItemID, alerttext                      ltscriptgt         ltdivgtlta titleRemove item from cart hrefjavascriptcart.removeItemitem.ItemIDgtRemove Itemltagtltdivgt        codepre  pSince the javascript function is defined inside a loop, the name needs to be different each time, hence the itemid in the function name. It should grab the custom removeitem text and then call codecart.removecode, just like it was previously being done inside the href definition. strongThe problem is that this function coderemoveItemitem.ItemIdcode is not being called.strong Even if I just put an codealertcode or codeconsole.logcode inside the function, the code never fires. Is there anyway to accomplish this Ive also tried calling that function by using a click listener bound to a class that is on a codeltspangt orcode. Any suggestions I can clearly see, by viewing the page source, that each of the carts current items have their own removeitem function defined, but for some reason, the code isnt reachable.p
Negative 23896 pI have a multiproject build. Subproject CoolApp depends on subproject CrazyJar.

But CrazyJar has no sources I end up publishing an empty artifact. Is there any way I can mangle this to work as though it were a normal Java project If not, anything else I might dop

Negative 23896 pHey im making a game out of primitive objects.  To make these objects im using the Vertex Buffer.  The problem im having is that when i am rendering a cube it looks perfect...

The idea of scaling the cube bigger is to make a Skybox.p  pHere is some imagesp  pDeformed Cube a hrefhttpi.imgur.com5aGu7mF.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com5aGu7mF.pngap  pPerfect small cube a hrefhttpi.imgur.comFmMBb4X.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comFmMBb4X.pngap  pMy codep  pPath Data for the Skybox using vertices.p  precode   private void loadSkyboxDataColor color                              VertexPositionColorTexture[] verts  new VertexPositionColorTexture[25]                 Top Left                  verts[0]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[1]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[2]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[3]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 Top Left                  verts[4]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[5]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[6]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[7]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 Top Left                  verts[8]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[9]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[10]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[11]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 Top Left                  verts[12]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[13]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[14]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[15]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 Top Left                  verts[16]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[17]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[18]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[19]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 Top Left                  verts[20]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500 ,500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[21]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[23]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 verts[24]  new VertexPositionColorTexturenew Vector3500, 500, 500, color, new Vector20, 0                 vertexDictionary.AddSkybox, new BufferedVertexTextureDataverts, PrimitiveType.TriangleStrip, 21 codepre  pBufferedVertexTextureData.csp  precode  public class BufferedVertexTextureData  VertexTextureData              protected VertexBuffer vertsBuffer          public BufferedVertexTextureDataVertexPositionColorTexture[] verts, PrimitiveType primitiveType, int primitiveCount              baseverts, primitiveType, primitiveCount                      this.vertsBuffer  new VertexBufferObject3D.Game.GraphicsDevice, typeofVertexPositionColorTexture, verts.Length, BufferUsage.WriteOnly             this.vertsBuffer.SetDataverts, 0, verts.Length                   public override void DrawBasicEffect effect                      apply all changes             effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply              instruct gfx card to use vertsbuffer             Game.GraphicsDevice.SetVertexBuffervertsBuffer              draw             Game.GraphicsDevice.DrawPrimitivesPrimitiveType, 0, PrimitiveCount                codepre  pThanks for the help in advance.

Negative 23896 pIn my main activity I have a codeViewPagercode with two tabs and each of them has its contents in a fragment. One of the tabs holds a list of items and when I press on an item from that list I want the details of that item to appear on the screen. I thought of putting the whole codeViewPagercode in a fragment and when the user taps the item the fragment representing the whole codeViewPagercode is replaced with another fragment representing the details of the item. Is it possible and is it a good practice Maybe I should just start another activity with the details of the item p

Negative 23896 pI am trying to see if I can use a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuiuirouteruiroutera to delegate setting of state to my apps subcomponents by implementing lazy loading of the states.  While I managed to get the lazy loading part to work using codestate.gocode or equivalent, I cant get it to work using the URL.p  pFor example, on launch my codeappcode will only setup the following 2 states codeview1code and codeview2code.  When codeview1code state is loaded, it then setup its own children states of codeview1.profilecode and codeview1.interestcode.

Negative 23896 pI am working with a database that uses QuickBase... What I am trying to accomplish is making a custom graph using HighCharts. p  pI had someone helping me do this earlier and they told me that I would need to make an API call from QuickBase to query the data I needed. I figured that out, but they went offline and now I am once again stuck scratching my head.p  pSo far I have managed to set up my api call which looks like this a hrefhttppastie.org9351447 relnofollowhttppastie.org9351447ap  pI was told that since it returns it as XML that it would not directly be able to populate a chart from there, so I am now trying to figure out how to turn this into what I am needing it to be JS. p

Negative 23896 pIm very aware this forum is full of this topics about Titanium, infact the topics here helped me the last years to set it up always. But not this time...p  pI got a new Laptop and now funny things are going on. I have Androidstudio installed that comes with an own sdk folder when installed. This is the same as the downloadable sdk to work with eclipse at least i think so... has same folders and all.p  pAndroid Studio works fine with the SDK, be it Emulators or real Devices. Then i also had to install Titanium to work on an older project. Sadly i cannot get Titanium to work with any sdk now. I entered the right path to the SDK in Titanium of course and on the frontpage it shows me that Android SDK is correctly configured. But whenever i run a project i dont have any Android based options, only Preview in Web. So then i looked back into the Preferences and here it shows suddenly that theres no Android SDK in the specified folder. Even there is one in of course...p  pI switch back on Frontpage and still theres a green dot and the AndroidConfi and it shows all good.p  pNow when i play around with the paths in the Preferences window weired things happen... Sometimes i can choose a Emulator Device that is already in the AVDManager but it disappears after i leave the menu....p  pI tried many things already, also download the standalone SDK from google, its the same. Also when i hit the Setup Button i get the options to download all the sdks, with 2 of them greyedout and all others unchecked. But i have nearly every API Version completley installed, also for example 2.3.3 that is unchecked here. If i check and want to configure it downloads, installs and then nothing happens... When going back into the menu the same is checkedunchecked like before. But no error message when downloadeing.p  pWhat can it bep  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsuxtia357r1kqioe1.png relnofollowBild1ap  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms9u4e2nveyiqsf2s21.png relnofollowBild2ap

Negative 23896 pBasically I have a bunch of performance analysis that [given naive interpetation] claims 70 of the time is spent in synchronization on our web application under heavy load, and mostly in SNIReadSyncOverAsync which internally in the data reader calls.

Negative 23896 pI need a query that will return the date of every Monday between two dates. It is intended to be in the basis of another query that counts weekly transactions Monday till Sunday, and it should be able to represent weeks without any transaction.p  pThis means it cant rely on the existing data in the transactions table, because there is no representation there to weeks without any transactions.p  pFor example for the 3 weeks starting on Monday  July 21, 2014  I need a query that returns the followingp  blockquote   p20140721p      p20140728p      p20140804p blockquote  pAssuming my transactions were logged on the following datesp  blockquote   p20140722p      p20140723p      p20140725p      p20140805p blockquote  pI will want to write a query that returns the aggregated number of transaction per weekp  blockquote   p20140721  3p      p20140728  0p      p20140804  1p blockquote  pAnd thats why I cant rely on the data itself, and need a query to generate every Monday between two given dates.

Negative 23896 pIm having a bit of a weird problem. The CMS of our website was developed about 4 years ago, but the person who made it is no longer working for our company so Im left with the management of it. So far, so good since the CMS works just fine for normal content managing. However we also happen to have a small webshop on our site and the prices and some text needs to be changed. I found the prices were listed in a MySQL table and was able to change them. However, the only text on the page is    p  precodelth2gtZand  Grind bestellenlth2gt ltpgtgrondstofbestellendeel1ltpgt codepre  pBut the page you see as a visitor clearly lists a few options and some text. I know its difficult for anyone without access to say whats going on, but maybe the  indicate its pointing to something I have a feeling some PHP is involved since the person made pretty much everything with it. p  pDespite it being far fetched I hope someone can give me some ideas on whats happening here. p

I  found several useful advices, several pratical examples and many starting points and I tried and tried again to mix each others the parts of these codes, but without getting what I really need about. All of this because I think my request is a bit specific and Ill try to explain it by hoping to be as clear as possible. p  pIn my case I dont have just to fix a column, because I found meny examples about that as already told above. In my case I need to synchronize the left sidebar scrolling with the main column scrolling.p  pSomething similar is present in Facebook, if you go into your profile page you can find something similar to what I need. By the way, I try to explain it here below by hoping to be as clear as possiblep  ul lipat the time that I scroll the page strongDOWNstrong I need that BOTH the left sidebar and the main column scroll down together, until the left sidebar will show the strongLASTstrong visible element contained into it.

Negative 23896 pI use the Apache HTTP client 3.1 with the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager to poll an API every couple second. Whenever a new version of the API is deployed, the DNS entries are changed to point to a new server. Since I use HTTP keep alive and the old server does not close the connection, I keep hitting the old server which leads to various problem. It does not help to use the IdleConnectionTimeoutThread since the connection is never idle for a longer time and I couldnt find an setting which lets me limit the time for which a connection is reused.p  pI dont want to disable keep alive because this would add too much overhead. My current idea is to set a new connection manager every minute and call the shutdown method on the old connection manager. However, I am not convinced that this is the right approach.

It is possible to select multiple pngs and change the property for all selected, but I can only manage to select all pngs in a single subfolder and not in multiple folders. When your selection contains a folder the properties window does not allow me to change the settings of all pngs, because its now a mixed group pngs  folders. I would like to know if anyone has found a smart way of dealing with this, other then going past every subfolder and changing the property by hand.p  pIve tried to find the specific file that contains the properties, but I could only find the contentproj. This contains metadata for all the content in an xmlstyle file, but it only has the name, importer and precossor properties.

That way I could just reimport all pngs and have the generate mipmaps property set to true by default. But I could not find out where to change defaults nor if this is possible at all.p

Now this compiled pieces will be stored in memory for later access. p  pFirst question  p  blockquote   pWhat part does the installation process e.g. through an install   wizzard play here Or is istallation just needed in directly compiled   scenarios where the compiler first has to go through all of the code   before runtime That means that installing the program is basicaly   compiling it on a production machine, rightp blockquote  pSecond question  p  blockquote   pIs the JITcompiled code stored in harddrive so that compiled code   never is compiled again or is this compilation process done everytime   I click on an exefilep blockquote  pThanks for helping out.p

Negative 23896 pMy department has installed google analytics on our companies website and none of us are exactly experts on understanding why the data is the way it is.p  pAnyways, our company is fairly large, but I wouldnt say we are exactly a well known company. We provide internet and Video on Demand to Hotels worldwide. Anyways, as of right now, since I have installed our code last month, we have a total session number of over 78,000. Our average session duration is only 24 seconds, with an average page view per visitor at 1.18 and a bounce rate of 91. p  pI dont doubt the session average time. Me and my coworkers are just a little confused as to how with that many visitors, we are consistently across the board getting such a fairly small session duration and a high bounce rate. Could visitors possibly just come to our website, look for our phone number and than leave the site Im just trying to find a way to reduce the bounce rate and hopefully increase the session duration average. Or is it possible to add a filter that will exclude visits to the site that are less than 30 seconds, or something like that I apologize for asking such fairly basic questions Im sure. I am trying to get up to speed and familiarize myself with how this all works. Just thought Id maybe ask and see if I am missing something important. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

We need to update to Facebook api v2.2, or later than v1.0p  pDoes scribe support connection to facebook api v2.2 p  pIf i look on the generated url which is sent to the user, v1.0 version a hrefhttpswww.facebook.comdialogoauthclientid12345678901ampredirecturihttp3A2F2Flocalhost3A80802Findex.facebookoauthconnect3Aauthorizeampscopeemail2Cuserbirthday relnofollowhttpswww.facebook.comdialogoauthclientid12345678901ampredirecturihttp3A2F2Flocalhost3A80802Findex.facebookoauthconnect3Aauthorizeampscopeemail2Cuserbirthdayap  pIf i understand right, i connect to the v2.2 api by including v2.2 like the following v2.2 version ...facebook.comv2.2dialog...p  pIs that correct At least this works for our scenario.p  pThe URLs to facebook are defined in org.scribe.builder.api.FacebookApi and are not manipulated later in the code, so that i think scribe supports only v1.0 facebook api. Is that correctp  pIs it enough to insert the v2.2 into the url by ourself to connect to the v2.2 apip  pKind regards Davidp

Negative 23896 pImagine that you have a simplistic GUI application. When you open it, there is an input box and a button placed on the application window. When you press the button you should see the entered value displayed in a popup message box. Of course, the button can be clicked without entering the value into the input box. Another possibility is that user exits the application right after opening it.

Im writing code to perform an xdirection lorentz boost. The problem Im running in to is that I, as its written below, ct returns with a proper float value, but x does not. Messing around, I find that tempx is a float, but assigning tempx to r[0] does not make that into a float, instead it rounds down to an int. I have previously posted a question on mutability vs immutability, and I suspect this is the issue. If so I clearly have a deeper misunderstanding than expected. Regardless, there are a couple of questions I havep  p1a If instantiate a with a  FourVectorct5,r[55,2.,3], then typea.r[0] returns numpy.float64 as opposed to numpy.int32. What is going on here I expected just a.r[1] to be a float, and instead it changes the type of the whole listp  p1b How do I get the above behaviour The whole list being floats, without having to instantiate the variables as floats I read up on the documentation and have tried various methods, like using astypefloat, but everything I do seems to keep it as an int. Again, thinking this is the mutableimmutable problem Im having.p  p2 I had thought, in the tempx... line, multiplying by 1.0 would convert it to a float, as it appears this is the reason ct converts to a float, but for some reason it doesnt. Perhaps the same reason as the othersp  precodeimport numpy as np  class FourVector     def initself, ct0, x0, y0, z0, r[]         self.ct  ct         self.r  np.arrayr         if r  []             self.r  np.array[x,y,z]      def boostself, beta         gamma1np.sqrt1beta  2         tempctself.ctgammabetagammaself.r[0]         tempx1.0self.ctbetagammaself.r[0]gamma         self.cttempct         printtypeself.r[0]         self.r[0]tempx.astypefloat         printtypeself.r[0]  a  FourVectorct5,r[55,2,3] b  FourVectorct1,r[4,5,6] printa.r a.boost.5 printa.r codepre

Negative 23896 pIm coming from a MapReduce background and Im quite new to Spark. I could not find an article explaining the architectural difference between MapReduce and Spark. My understanding so far is the only difference the MapReduce and Spark have is the notion of inmemory processing. That is, the Spark has mappingreducing phase and they might run on two different nodes within the cluster. Pairs with the same keys are transferred to the same reducer and there is a shuffling phase involved. Am I correct or there is some difference in the way mapping and reducing stages are done and...p

Im doing as a 3d array because in the real data, it wont be a simple 3array choice, but for SO purposes, it helps to keep it simple.

Negative 23896 pI have need for an algorithm which can find predefined patterns in data which is present in the form of strings independent from the actual symbolscharacters of the data and the pattern. I only care about the relations between the symbols, not the symbols themselves. It is also legal to have different pattern symbols for the same symbol in the data. The only thing the pattern matching algorithm has to enforce is that multiple occurences of the same symbol in the pattern are preserved. To give you an examplep  pThe pattern is strongabcastrong, so the first and the last letter are the same. For my application, an equivalent way to write this would be strong1 2 3 1strong, where the digits are just variables. The data I have is strongthistextisateststrong. The resulting algorithm should give me two correct matches here, strongtextstrong and strongteststrong. Because only in these two cases, the first and the fourth letter are the same, as in the pattern.p  pAs a second example, the pattern strongabcdstrong should return 12 matches one for each position in thistextisat. Since no variable in the pattern is repeated, it is trivially matched everywhere. Even in the case of strongtextstrong and strongteststrong, because it is legal that the variables strongastrong and strongdstrong of the pattern map to the same symbol.p  pThe goal of this algorithm should be to detect similarities in written language. Imagine having a dictionary of the English language and parsing it with the pattern strongunseenstrong or equivalently strong1 2 3 4 4 2strong. You would then see that, for example, the word strongbelittlestrong contains the same pattern of letters.p  pSo, now that I hopefully made clear what I need, I have some questionsp  ul lipWhat is this algorithm called Is it a wellknown problem that has been solvedpli lipAre there publications on the matter It is really hard to find anything useful when you dont know the correct search terms to separate this problem from regular pattern matching.pli liIs there a ready implementation of thisli ul  pI have not used Regex for anything too complicated, so I dont know if anything like this would even be possible in Regex, when you basically do not care about the symbols as such, but only consider the pattern of their occurences.p  pId really appreciate your helpp

But when goes to background and phone is in sleep mode, it is showing some strange behaviour. Strange in the sense that instead of calling codeupdateLocationToServercode every 10 seconds, it gets called after every minute and sometimes it gets more worse. I dont know how 10 seconds are being interpreted as one minute in sleep mode. I want to know what are the possible reasons for such a delay My application is mainly for taxi drivers and want to keep track of them all the time. The clients whole business depends on this thing and its like make it or break it thing. Your suggestions please. p  pEdit And my client is using 3G and 4G network to test the app.p

Negative 23896 pMy Django 1.62. application contains a showmembers viewtemplate that shows the names and photos of all members on my site.  The catch is that I have to review each members photo before allowing it to be displayed on the showmembers page.  Therefore, when a new member joins, I display a placeholder image until Ive reviewed and approved their photo.  Once thats done, their real photo should be displayed on that page.p  pNow currently I use the same name for both the placeholder image and the real photo.  This allows me to easily display either image on the showmembers page with this HTMLp  precodelt Part of showmembers.html   placeholder and photo both named usernamethumb.jpg gt ltimg src MEDIAURL photosapproved username  username thumb.jpg gt codepre  pThe problem is that when a new user first joins the site, the showmembers template will show their placeholder image from the server plus the photos of other site members usually from the clients browser cache as it should.  However, once Ive approved the new users photo, their old placeholder image will continue to appear in the client browser unless the clients user forces a refresh while bypassing their cache.p  pIs there a way I can programmatically force the showtemplates page to repull the new users new approved photo from the server while still retrieving the cached images for the other users  I realize that I could give different names to the placeholder image and approved photo and then pass a boolean to the template and use it to display one or the other.  However, that seems like a rather inelegant solution.   Is there another customary way to do thisp  pThanksp

This is majorly impacting the perceived speed of the application.

Ive tried lots of other stuff like sending a codeContentTypecode of codetextplaincode, but it seems that the Authorization header is the thing that is violating the CORS Simple request requirement.p  pSo it seems that I may have to move the API over to use token based authenticationauthorization. In order to avoid preflight requests, it seems that I will need to place the token in the query string. This is okay as it is only a small internal web app which will only be accessed by a couple of users anyway. I intend to implement caching on controller responses.

However the last scenario isnt workingp  pWhen a client issues an UPDATE command, the server should then send a message back to all connected clients that they need to do something.p  hr  pstrongExample Commsstrongp  precode1 Client A          GetTime gt          Server Client A          lt Time is...

Problem is that all my script files are being concatenated and then just strongaddedstrong to the codemain.jscode file, so if I save 3 times, I will basically have 3 copies of all my scripts concatenated and put in the codemain.jscode file. p  pI would like to either delete the codemain.jscode file each time I save and then run the concatenation, or just clean the file before adding the contents.

Negative 23896 pI know that if I have a git repo checked out, I can use the codegitcode cli to get the current commit hash.

Negative 23896 pI have a codeUIViewControllercode that is presented in two ways, either modally or pushed on top of a navigation controller stack. The codeUIViewControllercode contains a codeUITableViewcode and a codeUIToolbarcode. When presented modally, i needed a way of showing a codetitlecode for the codeViewControllercode, so I added in another codeUIToolbarcode, codetopToolbarcode. My problem is, whenever I push the codeUIViewControllercode, I dont need codetopToolbarcode anymore, since the codenavigation tabbarcode already shows the title. When I set codetopToolbarcodes hidden property to codetruecode, however, my codeUITableViewcode is not bound to the bottom of the codenavigation tab barcode and theres space between the codeUITableViewcode and the codenavigation tabbarcode, which doesnt look so good. I tried to call coderemoveFromSuperviewcode on codetopToolbarcode instead of setting its codehiddencode property to codetruecode, but that didnt work out, and codetopToolbarcode appeared under the codenavigation barcode, and now i have two codetitlescode instead of one. Any idea on how this can be done I cant add pictures, but heres my code for manipulating the appearance of the codeUIViewControllercode based on whether its presented modally or pushed on top of the navigation stackp  precode override func viewWillAppearanimated Bool      super.viewWillAppearanimated     if itemBought  nil          cart.items.appenditemBought           totalView.layer.borderColor  UIColor.grayColor.CGColor     totalView.layer.borderWidth  0.5      totalLabel.text    Stringformat .2f, cart.getTotal      if let navBar  self.navigationController.navigationBar          hide toolbar and tabbar         topToolbar.removeFromSuperview         self.tabBarController.tabBar.hidden  true          hide shop button         var bottomItems [UIBarButtonItem]  bottomToolbar.items as [UIBarButtonItem]         if let index  findbottomItems, shopToolbarButton              bottomItems.removeAtIndexindex                  bottomToolbar.items  bottomItems       codepre  pI should also mention that i have a constraint on the codeUITableViewcode thats basically distance between codeUItableView.topcode and codeTop Layout Guide.Bottomcode is codeltcode to the height of codetopToolbarcode, which is 44. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 23896 pCurrently I am having two tables say TableA, TableB. I am able to drag rows from TableA to TableB or drag rows from TableB on to itself by using transferhandler. The problem is, after I drag and drop rows containing same icon data from Table A to Table B, In table B the user can change one text info and when they drag this modified line to another row within table B the modified data also updates existing values that has same icons. In tables first column is an icon and other two rows are text fields that user can modify. p  pI want to have this modified row not to update an existing record of same icon during drag operation.

Negative 23896 pIm working on an embedded system where a register hast to be accessed and after that to be incremented to achieve the result Im looking for, since the machine is notifying and configured to react on my access and changing or not changing the flag. So the codeswitchcodes argument has to be kept as it is, since it would otherwise change the behaving of the embedded system.p  pBut there may occur a situation where I dont want to get any of the cases get invoked. But I still need to acces and increment the argument of the codeswitchcode.p  pMore indepth Im converting a sequence of analog values to digital values conversions step by step. The index is used to stay synchronized with the current conversion and relating it with the corresponding case to handle the figure correct. There may occur a state in which the index desynchronisizes to the current conversion so the sequence of conversions must be run through without any of the cases getting invoked to prevent setting wrong data untill the sequence is finished and the resynchroinisation can get performedp  pThe way Im currently doing this is thisp  precodeswitch RunIndexRunIndex may only be accessed one time per execution of this construct and has to be incremented in the same step. thats given.     if RunIndexSyncedWithADCensured  false          break        case 0      Case0RelatedData  SomeOperationsForCase0RawData      break    case 1      Case1RelatedData  SomeOperationsForCase1RawData      break    case 2      Case2RelatedData  SomeOperationsForCase2RawData      break    default      RunIndex  0      break  codepre  pThis construct does the job but it looks like it is a bit controversial and I dont feel well by considering about committing this into productinal code.p  pSo is there a better looking way to achieve the same, without the need of additional variables or assignementsp  pstrongnotestrongp  pAlso it may be relevant, that this is in the first part of a interupt function consisting of 2 parts. The first part handles what has to happen codeifcode a conversion is finished. The second part, what has additional to be done codeifcode this conversion also ended the sequence. So it is no option to simply return from the function without getting into the second part. and there is currently no loop structure where an codeif...breakcode may break out. What is also the reason why Im putting the if inside the switch scope, as it is at least by standard a valid way to break out.p
Negative 23896 pOur company website makes use of codeMagento 1.9.1.0code. After an external agency helped us set up everything, we are now using the codeMagento Admin Panelcode to add products and configure promotions.p  pRight now, we are facing some issues with codeMagento 1.9.1.0code which we cant seem to find free solutions to.p  ol lipWe want to add a promotion to a product in strongCategory Astrong priced at em3.50em. If a customer orders 5 or more products in strongCategory Astrong, each product will be priced at em3em.pli lipFor a product in strongCategory Astrong, we want to add a custom option which costs em1em. Therefore, when chosen, the total price of a product in strongCategory Astrong will be em4.50em. But the discount should not be applied to the custom option.pli lipWhen the custom option is chosen, the total price is updated correctly before adding it to the shopping cart. But in the shopping cart and checkout pages, the price is still being displayed as em3.50em.pli ol  pWe have contacted the external agency regarding the abovementioned issues, but we have not received any replies so far. I have searched on Google each of these issues over the past few days and it seems like I have to edit the HTML codes, especially for the 3rd problem. But I cant seem to find the source code in our companys FTP where all the files have been uploaded.p
Negative 23896 pI am using a C extension module in Python call it ext using ctypes to access a C library.  I have two ctypes structures, Foo and Bar, which circularly point to one another. Explicitly, Bar holds a ctypes pointer to an instance of Foo, and Foo holds a void pointer for long reasons that gets assigned to an instance of Bar, i.e.p  precodeclass FooStructure     fields  [number, cint,                  ptr, cvoidp]  class BarStructure     fields  [ptr, POINTERFoo]     def initself, f         ext.initbyreff, byrefself  f  Foo b  Barf codepre  pwhere the C code for codeext.initcode, which assigns the pointers, looks like thisp  precodevoid initstruct Foo f, struct Bar b   fgtptr  b   bgtptr  f  codepre  pI can now print codenumbercode withp  precodeprintb.ptr.contents.number codepre  pBut if I access this variable a second time, I get this error  p  precodepython1104,0x7fff75425300 malloc  error for object 0x10706b6e0  pointer being freed was not allocated codepre  pI believe ctypes always makes a new object whenever you retrieve an attribute, so maybe the problem is that Bar cant release the memory ptr points to since it didnt allocate it  If it makes a difference, Foo and Bar are in different C extensions.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI think I understand things slightly better now.  When I callp  precodeprintb.ptr.contents.number codepre  pI think a new python object is created for b.ptr.contents.  Then, when it goes out of scope after the print statement, codeFoo.delcode gets called Im at least sure of the last part, since I added a print statement in codeFoo.delcode.p  pcodeFoo.delcode is set up to call a function in the C library to free all the pointers in the instance the real struct is more complicated than above.  p  pI dont understand how the object codeb.ptr.contentscode gets created.  If it doesnt call codeFoo.initcode, then the memory for the pointers wouldnt get allocated, so maybe it would make sense that I get the error abovep

Negative 23896 pI have several entities in a Symfony2 app e.g. Timecard, Job, and Worker.

Negative 23896 pOne unhappy side effect of upgrading to Xcode 7 is that I can no longer push to my Gitlab repo.  I have been pushing and pulling from my project without problem for the last two years, so I suspect Xcode 7 is doing something different.  I have verified my up for Gitlab by logging into and out of it via the web interface. When I go to Xcode  Preferences  Accounts, select the gitlab project, I see that the username and password are in there just like they have been for 2 years and I verify that they are correct.p  pIt is worth noting that I can successfully post from Terminal, however, I do not wish to use Terminal to push my code to Gitlab on a regular basis.  Has anyone else encountered this problem since upgrading  Any suggestions as to a fixp  pThe specific error I am getting is Authentication failed because the user name or password was incorrect.  This error appears in the Accounts dialog, as well as after trying to perform a push to the gitlab repo.p
