Positive 6610 pIm making CORS requests between my web application and a server. The request is a simple authorization request. The request is sent, the server sets a JSESSIONID cookie, a dialogue box pops up, you type your username and password and then press submit.

Positive 6610 pI have a need to convert some of my perl CGIscripts to binaries. But when I have a script of 100kb converted into binary it becomes about 23Mb. This is understood why, as compiler has to pack inside all the needed tools to execute the script. The question is about the time of pages loading on the server, when they are binary. Say, if I have a binary perlscript script, that answers on ajax requests and that binary weights about 3mb, will it reflect on AJAX requests If, say, some users have low connection, will they wait for ages until all these 3Mb will be transferred Or, the server WONT send all the 3mb to a user, but just an answer short XMLJSON whatsoeverp  pAnother case is when I have HTML page, that is generated by this binary perlscript on the server. User addresses his browser to the script, that weights 3Mb and after he has to get an HTML page. Will the user wait again, until the whole script is been loaded every single byte form those 3Mb, or just wait the time that is needed to load EXACTLY the HTML page say, 70Kb, and the rest mass will be run on the serverside only and wont make the user to wait for itp  pThanksp

Positive 6610 pSome context Im using Bigcommerce which doesnt support PHP to design a storefront and want to allow users to add a product inside of the checkout page emwithoutem redirecting them to the cart page.  I know this is possible because on the front page, there are some preprogrammed buttons which are simply codelta hrefhttpsomestore.comcart.phpactionaddampproductid9001gtcode tags with some buttonlike styling.  These pull up a modal, and most importantly emadd the product to the cartem  both without redirect.p  pSo at first this struck me as a simple problem  just code.ajaxcode to the page and be done with it, but then I ran into the old codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode error, which is strange, since Im writing my Javascript on the same domain that Im trying to hit, only the subdomain is different cart vs checkout.  I decided to look deeper at the request made by this magical button.  The only Request Header which is not present on my own dysfunctional version of this request is codeXRequestedWithcode which I of course tried to add to my codeXMLHttpRequestcode unsuccessfully.p  pThe second thing I noticed was an extra URL paramter which wasnt originally listed in the source, codefastcart1code so I tried adding that, and was taken to a PHP page I obviously wasnt meant to see.  Its easily roughly 200 lines of spaghetti, and Im not sure I can post it here.  Its obvious that a script somewhere was taking this codehrefcode and using it to make a GET request, but how  Ive tried both codeXMLHttpRequestcode, and codeajaxcode, but both give me the codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode response.p  pIve seen the use of a technique where you disallow the redirect of the page on an codelta hrefgtcode by adding an code.clickfunctionecode to it, and calling either codereturn falsecode or codee.preventDefaultcode but these simply dont allow my codelta hrefgtcode to accomplish anything at all, let alone some ninja codeGETcode request.  My question is ultimately about why my own attempts at a codeGETcode request to this page have failed, when a simple codelta hrefgtcode has been able to bypass SOP and make the request almost in secret.p  pObviously Ill have to spend some more time looking at the PHP script I was taken to by the extra parameter.  Nevertheless, this has turned out to be a much bigger mystery than I had originally thought it would be, teaching me a lot along the way.  Unfortunately, I havent solved it yet, and I really need to get this functionality working.  If its helpful for me of the source on these requests, Ill be happy to, but for now Ive run out of time and have to get some rest. If some one with more web development experience can help, I would be extremely grateful  p

Positive 6610 pI recently found out that Chrome seems to have a connection limit of 6  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23679968chromehangsaftercertainamountofdatatransferedwaitingforavailablesocChrome hangs after certain amount of data transfered  waiting for available socketa  unfortunately I found this out the hard way by getting a waiting for available sockets message after loading up too many tabs 7.p  pI know it is Chrome since another Chrome user a.k.a another browser session loads the web page perfectly fine on the same computer at the same time I have multiple Chrome users open on my computer. So it is not the server in any way.p  pI believe this is because, in socket.io which I am using for notifications, I am xhrpolling which is causing Chrome to have to wait until it can grab a socket from one of those connections before it can process the page.p  pWhat is the solution to thisp  pI have thought of a couple of solutionsp  ul limake the xhrpolling window smaller, this increases connections in the browser and node.js but will mean the page wont stall.li liUse websockets. I am unsure if websockets are immune to this problem either.li liMake connections inactive on tabs not focused. Though it seems other sites dont have to do that...li liUse some kind of connection sharing. Considering that Chrome isolates websockets and xhr requests to the tab I do find it difficult to understand how that works.li ul  pAs an added point the reason I have not gone with websockets from the start is because I use cloudflare.

Negative 6610 pI am currently writing a wizardstyle application using Qt4. I am not using the wizard class however, since going nextback does not make sense from every step in the process.p  pThe user starts off at a hubwindow with five buttons, each of which take him to another window at a different stage of the process. At the beginning all but the first button of the hub are disabled. After clearing each stage, the user will be directed back to the hub and one new buttonstage will get enabled.p  pSince every stage has significantly differing objectives, I coded every single stage as a single QWidget that gets instantiated in the main function. To switch between the widgets, I simply hide the one I am leaving and show the one I am going to.br  However, this leads to problems if the user resized or moved one widget, since the next widget will always show up at its default position instead of the new one.p  pIs there a way to synchronize the widgets sizes and positionsp  pOr, better yet, is there a more elegant way to deal with those different windows than switching between several hidden widgetsp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 6610 pI was reading some things about exception handling in Java, to be able to write better code. OK, I admit, I am guilty Ive used too much trycatch blocks, Ive used codeex.printStackTracecode in the catch, not even using a proper logger actually the codeSystem.outcode and codeSystem.errcode were redirected to a codePrintWritercode, so a log was generated. However, after a few hours of readings, I find myself in a strange place the unknown. If the exceptions are designed to pass info about abnormal states of flow, how does one know WHERE is the proper level to do something with that info p  pFor instance, when a database error occurs, should one return a null value or an error code, or throw the exception If thrown, WHERE should that exception be handled I understand that is no use even to log an exception if you cant do anything about it. However, in GUI apps, that could easily kill your GUI I am using SWT and Ive seen this too often, even for the case of the codemenuShowncode method an codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundscode exception will close the app, if not handled. The example could go on forever, but heres the summary of questions p  ol liDoes using trycatch excessively have a negative impact on performanceli liIs it better to use specific exception types What if I missed catching one of the possible X types of exceptions that could occurbr Frankly, Ive heard of and use a mere 10 I think of the Java standard exceptions, in 23 years. Yes, someone said that if the caller dont know how to deal with the thrown exceptions, he SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to call the throwing method. Is that rightli liIve read this article of a hrefhttpwww.artima.comintvhandcuffs.htmlAnders Hejlsberga, saying that checked exceptions are bad. Should that indicate that convenient exception swallowing is advised in some cases li liA picture is worth 1000 words I guess some examples will help a lot here.li ol  pI know the subject is eternal, but actually I am looking forward to review a middlesize project of 150 classes, using your advice.

Negative 6610 pI am just setting up a simple library application, basically a collection of Members and a collection of Books.

Negative 6610 pHow do I create valid IP ranges given an IP address and Subnet mask in Perl I understand the concept of generating the IP ranges but need help writing in Perl. For example, if I AND the IP address and subnet mask I get the subnet number. Adding 1 to this number should give me the first valid IP. If I invert the subnet mask and OR with the subnet number, I should get the broadcast address. Subtracting 1 from it should give the last valid IP address.p
Negative 6610 pIm writing a piece of sotware that needs objects that exchange messages between each other. The messages have to have the following contentsp  precodePeer srcPeer const char msgText void payload int payLoadLen codepre  pnow, Peer has to be a pointer as I have another class that manages Peers. For the rest Im doubtful... for example I may copy the message text and payload by allocating two new buffers as the message is created, then putting the deletes in the destructor of the message. This has the great advantage of avoiding to forget the deletes in the consumer functions not the mention to make those functions simpler but it will result in many allocations amp copies and can make everything slow. So I may just assing pointers and still have the destructor delete eveything... or ... well this is a common situation that in other programming languages is not even a dilemma as there is a GC. What are your suggestions and what are the most popular practicesp  pEdit I mean that Id like to know what are the best practices to pass the contents... like having another object that keeps track of them, or maybe shared pointers... or what would you do...p

Negative 6610 pI recently discovered that a method in a derived class can only access the base classs protected instance members through an instance of the derived class or one of its subclassesp  precodeclass Base      protected virtual void Member     class MyDerived  Base       error CS1540     void TestBase b  b.Member       error CS1540     void TestYourDerived yd  yd.Member        OK     void TestMyDerived md  md.Member       OK     void TestMySuperDerived msd  msd.Member    class MySuperDerived  MyDerived    class YourDerived  Base   codepre  pI managed to work around this restriction by adding a static method to the base class, since Bases methods are allowed to access Base.Member, and MyDerived can call that static method.p  pI still dont understand the reason for this limitation, though. Ive seen a couple different explanations, but they fail to explain why MyDerived.Test is still allowed to access MySuperDerived.Member.p  pThe Principled Explanation iProtected means its only accessible to that class and its subclasses. YourDerived strongcouldstrong override Member, creating a new method that should only be accessible to YourDerived and its subclasses. MyDerived cant call the overridden yd.Member because its not a subclass of YourDerived, and it cant call b.Member because b might actually be an instance of YourDerived.ip  pOK, but then why can MyDerived call msd.Member MySuperDerived could override Member, and that override should only be accessible to MySuperDerived and its subclasses, rightp  pYou dont really know until runtime whether youre calling an overridden member or not. And when the member is a field, it cant be overridden anyway, but access is still forbidden.p  pThe Pragmatic Explanation iOther classes might add invariants that your class doesnt know about, and you must use their public interface so they can maintain those invariants. If MyDerived could directly access protected members of YourDerived, it could break those invariants.ip  pMy same objection applies here. MyDerived doesnt know what invariants MySuperDerived might add, either  it might be defined in a different assembly by a different author  so why can MyDerived access its protected members directlyp  pI get the impression that this compiletime limitation exists as a misguided attempt to solve a problem that can really only be solved at runtime. But maybe Im missing something. Does anyone have an example of a problem that would be caused by letting MyDerived access Bases protected members through a variable of type YourDerived or Base, but does emnotem exist already when accessing them through a variable of type MyDerived or MySuperDerivedp  pp  pUPDATE I know the compiler is just following the language specification what I want to know is the purpose of that part of the spec. An ideal answer would be like, If MyDerived could call YourDerived.Member, NIGHTMARE would happen, but that cant happen when calling MySuperDerived.Member because ITSALLGOOD.p

Negative 6610 pemI have worked with globalization settings in the past but not within the .NET environment, which is the topic of this question. What I am seeing is most certainly due to knowledge I have yet to learn so I would appreciate illumination on the following.emp  hr  pSetup My default language setting is English enus specifically. I added a second language Danish on my development system WinXP and then opened the language bar so I could select either at will. p  hr  pI selected Danish on the language bar then opened Notepad and found the language reverted to English on the language bar. I understand that the language setting is emper applicationem, so it seemed that Notepad set the default back to English. I found that strange since Windows and thus Notepad is used all over the world. Closing Notepad returned the setting on the language bar to Danish. I then launched my open custom WinForm applicationwhich I know does not set the languageand it emalsoem reverted from English to Danish when opened, then back to Danish when terminatedp  pstrongQuestion 1Astrong How do I get my WinForm application upon launch to inherit the current setting of the language bar My experiment seems to indicate that each application starts with the system default and requires the user to manually change it once the app is runningthis would seem to be a major inconvenience for anyone that wants to work with more than one languagep  pstrongQuestion 1Bstrong If one must, in fact, set the language manually in a multilanguage scenario, how do I change my default system language e.g. to Danish so I can test my apps launch in another languagep  hr  pI added a display of the current language in my application for this next experiment. Specifically I set a codeMouseEntercode handler on a label that set its tooltip to codeCultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Namecode so each time I mouse over I thought I should see the current language setting. Since setting the language before I launch my app did not work, I launched it then set the language to Danish. I found that some things like typing in a TextBox did honor this Danish setting. But mousing over the instrumented label still showed enusp  pstrongQuestion 2Astrong Why does codeCultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Namecode not reflect the change from my language bar while other parts of my app seem to recognize the change Trying codeCultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Namecode produced the same result. p  pstrongQuestion 2Bstrong Is there an event that fires upon changes on the language bar so I could recognize within my app when the language setting changesp  hr  h22010.05.13 Updateh2  pThe short but sweet information provided by Eric from Microsoft see his answer below directly addressed only one of my four questions 2A but it provided just the impetus I needed to delve further and figure out the rest. For the benefit of others who may also be befuddled by this, here is what I uncoveredp  pstrongAnswer 1Astrong An application inherits the setting of the default input language, emnotem the language you specify on the language bar. Once your application is running, then changes on the language bar emwillem be noticed immediately by your app.p  pstrongAnswer 1Bstrong Setting the default input language is done via Regional and Language Options control panel  Languages tab  Details  Settings tab  default input language.p  pstrongAnswer 2Astrong Answered by Eric, the current culture is distinct from the current input language that is reflected on the language bar typing in a text box is influenced only by the current input language.p  pstrongAnswer 2Bstrong There is no predefined event for either input language or current culture change notification. An important fact to note here is that input language changes are automatically recognized immediately while current culture changes are not. You must restart your application for a current culture change to take effectunless you can notice the change and act upon it yourself. To that end I found an MSDN article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163824.aspxS1 relnofollowThe Many Faces of the CultureInfo Classa that provides just such a hook to notice the change.p

Unfortunately I cant use the [XmlInclude] attribute, because by adding it to the parent class MyApp.Categories.Canine, I need to add a reference to the assembly in which the parent class exists MyApp.Animals.. however the child class is already referencing the parent class due to the inheritance... so we have a circular reference.p  pis there any best practice way of achieving this I can work around it by manually serializingdeserializing the properties that exist on the parent class, and just doing the serialization on the child, but thats not very elegant.p  pHoping for some better tips..p  pUPDATE Adding to the example in response to Johns comment below...p  pI dont have a full code example the code im working with is massive and complicated, but the issue is that some of the properties that should deserialise tofrom the xml are contained in the parent class, which is in a different assembly to the child class. p  pAdding the XmlElement attributes to the parent class doesnt work as we are actually doing the deserialisation on the child class, so it doesnt iterate up to the parent. And we cant do it on the parent because we cant add a reference to the child as the child is already referencing the parent, so the deserialiser wont know which child to act on.p  pTo add an extra level of complexity, the object that i have the problem with is actually being deserialised as part of a greater serialisation, by the following property of a parent objectp  precode    [XmlElementShippingAddress]     public Location ShippingAddress              get  return shippingAddress          set  shippingAddress  value       codepre  pThe problem is that the Location type here is the child location type.

Negative 6610 pI have a WPF application, that I want to convert to an application running from the browser. The reason is that WPF doesnt run on MacLinux, and Silverlight is not an option because of its security restrictions.p  pThe basic idea is to turn the app into a webserverlike application, and handle the UI completely in htmlajax. This webserver doesnt rely on WPFWinforms, so can run on Mono as well. And you can even control the app from your AndroidiOS device while on the road.p  pMy question is is it possible to create this user interface using .NET The code for the webserverpart is not a problem, but im struggling with the actual html that is being served. For example, when someone clicks a button, I need to bind an event to that. I have to write lots of javascript for all those little events, for simple controls like listboxes, progress bars, etc. It would be so much easier if I could design the webinterface from VS. While it has support for ASP, I cannot use its page designer, because the enduser will not have an ASP server running on their desktop PC. p  pSo what would be the best approach to design those dynamic pages using .NET Or is it simply not possiblep  pEDIT To make it more clear, its not an internet application.

Its a binary newsgrabber, that you install as a Windows Service, and can be controlled through your webbrowser. Its multiplatform, and written in Python.

Negative 6610 pi havent found the answer to my problem so I decided to write my question to get some help. I use lucene to index the objects in computer memorythey exist only in my java code. While processing the code i index using WhitespaceAnalyzer the field with falue objA4. My problem starts when i want to find it after the indexation also using whitespaceAnalyzer. When i create a query obj i find all objects that start with obj  if i create a query objA4 i also can find this object. However i dont know how to find all objects starting with objA , when i create a query objAem lucene is changing it to objaem and finds nothing. Ive checked and  is not a special character so i dont need any  preceding it. So my question is how to ask to get all objects that starts with objA for example  objA0, objA1, objA2, objA3p

Negative 6610 pI have many fields which are multi valued and not sure how to store them if i do 3NF then there are many tables. For example Nationality.p  pA person can have single or dual nationality. if dual this means it is a 1 to many. So i create a user table and a usernationality table. there is already a nationality lookup table. or i could put both nationalities into the same row like American, German then unserialize it on runtime. But then i dont know if i can search this like if i search for only German people will it show upp  pThis is an example, i have over 30 fields which are multivalued, so i assume i will not be creating 61 tables for this 1 user table, 30 lookup tables to hold each multivalued items lookups and 30 tables to hold the user values for the multi valued itemsp  pYou must also keep in mind that some multivalued fields group together like colleges i have studied at it has a group of fields such as college name, degree type, time line, etc. And a user can have 1 to many of these. So i assume i can create a separate table for this like usereducation with these fields, but lets assume one of these fields is also fixed list multivalued like college campuses i visited then we will end up in a never ending chain of FK tables which isnt a good design for social networks as the goal is it put as much data into as fewer tables as possible for performance.p

Negative 6610 pVB.NET 2010, .NET 4p  pHello,p  pI have an application which controls a process and several stopwatches that keep track of the elapsed time since various events.p  pThe simplified picture is  The process starts, at a later time an event A occurs, at a later time an event B occurs, etc...p  pThere are a finite number of such events.  At the start of each event including the process start event, I create and start a new stopwatch.  I then update some indicators that display the amount of time since each event started.p  pSo, I have a bunch of labels LabelStart, LabelA, LabelB, etc each formatted as HHMMSS which represent the elapsed time since each event occurred.  Their text is derived from the corresponding stopwatchs properties.p  pMy question is, would it be better to have one stopwatch and a list of offset integers from a CPUmemory efficiency standpoint  I.e., the stopwatch starts at process start and, at each event, an integer equal to the current elapsed milliseconds on that stopwatch is added to a list.  The labels could then be updated by subtracting the offset from the one running stopwatch.p  pI have no idea how they work.  Maybe this is a dumb question.  Im just curious.p  pThanks in advance Brianp

Negative 6610 pI am using jquery full calendar and one of the things it has is an id that should be unique per appointment or the same per a bunch of appointments.p  pIf you have the bunch of the same ids then all those appointments are considered repeating appointments.p  pI want to generate a repeating id for each of my appointment and apply it to all the appointments that should have that repeating id.p  pI figured that the best way to do this would be to use the primary key of my appointment table.p  pExamplep  precodePK 1, Title Test1,  Repeating Id 1 PK 2, Title Test2,  Repeating Id 2 PK 3, Title Test2,  Repeating Id 2 PK 4, Title Test2,  Repeating Id 2 PK 5, Title Test3,  Repeating Id 5 codepre  pSo the first and last row dont have any other rows that repeat with it.p  pRows 2 to 4 do repeat with each other.p  pNow in my code I generate all the repeating rows before insert. Since nhibernate does batch inserts I do all my inserts at once. So at this time I do not know what the PK will be for any of the rows.p  pI am wondering can I somehow tell it to take the first item that should be inserted and find its PK out and apply it to all the following items repeatingId columnp  pRight now I can only think of one way to do that and that is insert the first item and then get the PK back and then batch insert all the other items after with the repeating id filled in.p

Negative 6610 pWe have an app that draws text, but then displays a JTextArea for the user to edit the text when they click on the text. However, the wrapping between these two texthandling components differs.

Might seem silly now, but we use it to show the bounds of the text area when the user first selects the text they want to edit. At that point, the JTextArea isnt yet created. They have to click on it again to begin editing. The reason for this is that once a text area is selected, they may also drag and resize the text area, and that gets messy and more confusing if they had a live JTextArea when they started dragging and resizing.p  pSeparately, both the drawn TextLayouts and the JTextArea appear to wrap words just fine. but when used together you can see the difference. The problem with this is that while the user is editing the text, the JTextArea is doing its thing to wrap the text. But when the user JTextArea loses focus, it is converted to the drawn text, and then the words may be wrapped differently.p

Negative 6610 pMy application has some debug code written specifically to send debug data to the Output Window when running in debug mode.  When the function codeGetCurrTimecode is called in the below code snippet the application crashes on the following call to codemalloccode when I step through the code, or on the line preceding the call to codemalloccode, if I let it freerun.  However, the real oddity here is that when the crash occurs, the PC does not land on either of these lines.  The PC stops on the return line in an entirely unrelated function.  It gets better.  The Call Stack shows no place for the function to return to.  Im guessing that somehow the PC is getting off into the weeds.  What makes this all really odd, is that when I comment out the call to codeGetCurrTimecode the problem goes away.p  precodevoid PrintDevMsgTrace LPBYTE pMsg, PWCHAR fnName   ifdef DEBUG     BYTE byMsgLen     TCHAR  ptTimeStr  NULL     WORD cmd     int i, j  0     int iTimeStrLen, iStrLen, iPreOffset, iPostOffset     wchart  pCmdIdStr  NULL     wchart  pBuf  NULL      byMsgLen  pMsg[DEVLENOFFSET]  sizeofdevPktHeadt  sizeofdevPktTailt     cmd  pMsg[DEVCMDMSBOFFSET]     cmd ltlt 8     cmd  pMsg[DEVCMDLSBOFFSET]     pCmdIdStr  GetCmdIdStr cmd      ptTimeStr  GetCurrTime     iTimeStrLen  wcsnlens ptTimeStr, 128      iPreOffset          iTimeStrLen                              time string          1                                                wcsnlens fnName, 128              function name          3                                                  wcsnlens pCmdIdStr, 128           command ID string          3                                      0x     iPostOffset  iPreOffset  byMsgLen  3     .2X  formatted 2 hexnibble bytes and space     iStrLen  iPostOffset  3                   rn0     pBuf  wchart malloc iStrLen  sizeofwchart       swprintfs pBuf, iStrLen, Tss  s 0x, ptTimeStr, fnName, pCmdIdStr      for  i  iPreOffset i lt iPostOffset i  3               swprintfs amppBuf[i], 4, T.2X , pMsg[j]            swprintfs amppBuf[i], 3, Trn       TRACEpBuf      free pBuf  endif   TCHAR  GetCurrTime void       DWORD dwError  ERRORSUCCESS     TCHAR  ptRetVal  NULL ifdef DEBUG     int iTimeStrLen      do              if  iTimeStrLen  GetTimeFormat LOCALESYSTEMDEFAULT, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0   0                       dwError  GetLastError             TRACETs  Failed getting time format.rntError drntFile srntLine drn, TFUNCTION, dwError, TFILE, LINE             continue                   if  ptRetVal  TCHAR malloc iTimeStrLen   NULL                       dwError  ERRORNOTENOUGHMEMORY             TRACETs  Not enough memory.rntError drntFile srntLine drn, TFUNCTION, dwError, TFILE, LINE             continue                   if  GetTimeFormat LOCALESYSTEMDEFAULT, 0, NULL, NULL, ptRetVal, iTimeStrLen   0                       dwError  GetLastError             TRACETs  Failed getting time format.rntError drntFile srntLine drn, TFUNCTION, dwError, TFILE, LINE             continue                   while  0  endif      if  dwError  ERRORSUCCESS               free ptRetVal          ptRetVal  NULL           SetLastError dwError       return ptRetVal  codepre  pJust for kicks, heres the function the PC lands in when the crash occurs on the return statement of the last line of the functionp  precodeLPVOID CLinkListAdd LPVOID pItem, DWORD len       DWORD dwError  ERRORSUCCESS     LPVOID pItemCopy  NULL     LPLISTNODET ptNode  NULL      do               Validate parameters.         if  pItem  NULL  len  0                       dwError  ERRORINVALIDPARAMETER             TRACETCLinkListAdd  Invalid parameter.rntError drntFile srntLine drn, dwError, TFILE, LINE             continue                   if  thisgtmblCopy  FALSE                       pItemCopy  pItem                  else if  pItemCopy  malloc len   NULL                       dwError  ERRORNOTENOUGHMEMORY             TRACETCLinkListAdd  Failed to allocate memory.rntError drntFile srntLine drn, dwError, TFILE, LINE             continue                  else                      memcpy pItemCopy, pItem, len                    if  ptNode  LPLISTNODETmalloc sizeofLISTNODET   NULL                       dwError  ERRORNOTENOUGHMEMORY             TRACETCLinkListAdd  Failed to allocate memory.rntError drntFile srntLine drn, dwError, TFILE, LINE             continue                   ptNodegtnext  NULL         ptNodegtitem  pItemCopy         ptNodegtlen  len          if  thisgtmptFirstNode  NULL                       ptNodegtprev  NULL             thisgtmptFirstNode  ptNode                  else                      ASSERTthisgtmptLastNode  NULL              ptNodegtprev  thisgtmptLastNode             thisgtmptLastNodegtnext  ptNode                   thisgtmptLastNode  ptNode         thisgtmdwItemCount          while  0       if  dwError  ERRORSUCCESS               free ptNode           if  thisgtmblCopy  FALSE                       free pItemCopy                    pItemCopy  NULL           SetLastError dwError       return pItemCopy  codepre  pThis is the error, as printed in the Output Windowp  blockquote   pFirstchance exception at 0x7c936822   in ZCT.exe 0xC0000005 Access   violation reading location 0x00000000.

Negative 6610 h3Scenarioh3  pIm working on an application that has a little section dedicated to displaying statistics about the current state of the system. This includes such things as how many items are overdue, count of all pending items, count of all items without filters. When the user opens the application they must select which item labels they wish to work on before seeing any items in the UI. Once that is done the database gets queried and returns a list back to the user. Each item has an associated label. The item label is autogenerated before the users see it. One of these labels could be Overdue, which indicates to the user that it should be completed first.p  h3Problemh3  pIm struggling to find a good way to centralize the logic that determines if an item is overdue.p  pThe way I do this now is simple create a codeFuturecode NHibernate query and do all my statistic counts in one database transaction. The issue is that once I retrieve the items from the database which is already assigned a label, but if an item is overdue the system is supposed to override the label. So once the data is retrieved after the users select their labels I parse it into a tree and need to check each item whether its overdue or not. The logic is quite simple but located in 2 places because two different parts of the system need it for different purposes.p  pMy view model bound to my UI contains thisp  precodepublic bool IsOverdue      get              return             LabelName  Please Advise ampamp             DateTimeProvider.Current.DateTime.AddDays2 gt WorkToBeginDateTime        public void TakeActionIfOverdue      ifIsOverdue              LabelName  Overdue         LabelBackground  123456       codepre  pI call codeTakeActionIfOverduecode whenever Im building my tree, which overrides the label name if required.p  pAnd my NHibernate query looks like thisp  precodeDomain.Locate locateAlias  null Status statusAlias  null  var overdueCountQuery  session.QueryOver gt locateAlias     .SelectProjections.RowCount     .JoinAlias gt locateAlias.Status,  gt statusAlias     .Where gt statusAlias.Name  Please Advise     .Where gt locateAlias.WorkToBeginDateTime         .IsBetweenDateTimeProvider.Current.DateTime.Subtractnew TimeSpan48, 0, 0         .AndDateTimeProvider.Current.DateTime     .Where gt locateAlias.IsComplete  false     .FutureValueltintgt codepre  pAs you can see the logic determining if an item is overdue is in two places.p  pMy codeTreeViewcode which gets parsed and displayed once the user selects which label theyd like to see looks like this.p  precode Some Heading      Item 1 Foo Label      Item 3 Bar Label  Another Heading      Item 2 Bar Label      Item 4 Bar Label      Item 6 Overdue codepre  pIn this scenario the user selected label codeFoo Labelcode and codeBar Labelcode. For the sake of this example, lets pretend codeItem 6code had label codeBar Labelcode. However, the UI is displaying that it has label codeOverduecode because it was due 2 days ago.p  pAnd my little statistics box looks like this.p  precodeItems Overdue 4 Pending Items 45 All Items 49 codepre  h3Questionh3  pHow can I centralize this logicp

Negative 6610 pBit of a complex scenario here.p  pI have an embeded SVG graphic that will be altered by changes made to the parent HTML document. I have a text box and as you type a search into it, it will populate an ajax UL list. Navigation can be either selected via mouse or cursor key up and down. Selecting an item via return or mouseclick.p  pAll these work well.  I have added a method when a menu item is hovered over with the mouse, it will display the desired result in the SVG document.p  pI am doing this via a onmouseover event added to the li when it is generated in the PHP ajax call.  p  precodegtltli classltsearchClassgt onClickwin.hidePopup document.getElementByIdltfieldgt.value  ltlinegttextNamegt  onMouseOversvgCreateCircleltxgt,ltygt,red,ltlinegttextNamegtgtltimggtltlinegttextNamegtltligt lt codepre  pThe onmouseover has to be added at this point as it is from here that I am passing parameters x,y,text, colour to the SVG document so it knows what to place and where so I cant use the jquery method to dynamically attach a mouseover event.p  pThe issue I have is getting the keyboard navigation to do the same thing as the mouse navigation.  moving the mouse over the li element will display perfectly the result in the graphic, but navigating with cursor keys does not.  I get all the background changes etc simulating a mouseover but not the mouseover event its self.  Attempting to triger the event does nothing either.p  pI have used  p  precodeulitemSearchlist li.eqmenuitem.mouseover ulitemSearchlist li.eqmenuitem.triggermouseenter ulitemSearchlist li.eqmenuitem.triggerhover codepre  pbut none of those workp

Negative 6610 pWhat could be performance expectations of RabbitMQ on EC2 Would appreciate sharing experience here.p  pI am trying to do some performance test of RabbitMQ on aws EC2. I have 3 separate EC2 instance running for RabbitMQ, Publisher and consumerworker.p  pThe scenario I have is that Publisher pushes JSON string approx 165200 bytes to exchange type direct with durable set to true and bind queue with durable set to true i.e. both in persistent mode. Consumerworker is running on separate box  keeps pulling messages. Moving forward these messages at worker are expected to be persisted in MongoDB and Publisher would be replaced with Restful  service using REST easyp  pTo keep things simple I have simulated this scenario by using Multicast sample code. I had split multicast code in to two separate java file namely Producer and Worker to run each on separate box. I have used c1.mediam EC2 with Ubuntu server v11.4 32 bit for running producer and consumer and m1.large with Ubuntu server v11.4 64 bit for RabbitMQ.p  pI am able to achieve a throughput of 35k messages per second i.e. keeping study message push rate to 5K. This concur with a hrefhttpwww.rabbitmq.comfaq.htmlperformancelatency relnofollowhttpwww.rabbitmq.comfaq.htmlperformancelatencyap  pFurther, when I increase the push rate to 1012k messages per second. Consumers ability to consume messages drops to 12k messages per second and it generates backlog Many time it goes below 800 messages per second too.p  pWith above scenario, I have following questions and would appreciate thoughtssuggestion to improve throughput of consumer as well.  NOTE all the messages in my scenario are expected to similar type giving no opportunity to group them for setting routing therefore may need some kind of loadbalancer approachp  p1 This performance is observed with one rabbitMQ server, one exchange and one queue. Is anything further can be configured, finetuned to improvise throughput to more than 5k with persistent mode.p  p2 I do understand, clustering could be another option. However, I need to set cluster based on incoming load and I may not get message grouping  identity to define routing since messages are expected to be just log description. Can I have clustering following load balancing option for workerconsumerp  p3 I am expected to process several hundred thousand requests per second. I would appreciate sharing some experience and approach to achieve this.p

Negative 6610 pWhen implementing a clientserver solutions, one of the questions you always need to answer is about protocol.p  pIn simple cases, its possible that packets are always of the same type, so the protocol could even have no logic at all client connects to the server and sever just says some fact, the client disconnects and thats it.p  pIn more complex cases, some packets are can only be sent in some specific cases. For instance, imagine an abstract server that requires authorization clients emhave toem authorized before sending or getting any useful data. In this case, the concept of session appears.p  pSession is an concept that describes the state of clientserver dialog both client and sever emexpectem something from eachother, while there are also things that both of them dont expect.p  pThen, emgoing even deeperem, pretend that protocol is quite complicated and its implementation should be easily extendable. I believe, that the theoretically right solution here is using a finite state machine. Are there any Java frameworkslibraries that allow this state machine to be easily implemented Or probably, any more protocolspecific solutionsp  pWhat Im expecting is a framework that allows me to define states and transitions between them.p  pstrongUpdatestrong the question is not about easiest clientserver solution implementation, the question is about implementing custom protocol.

On pg. 18, under emThe Receivers Instance Variablesem, I saw this.p  blockquote   pA method has automatic access to the receiving objects instance   variables. You dont need to pass them to the method as parameters.   For example, the codeprimaryColorcode method illustrated above takes no   parameters, yet it can find the primary color for codeotherRectcode and return   it. Every method assumes the receiver and its instance variables,   without having to declare them as parameters.p      pThis convention simplifies ObjectiveC source code. It also supports   the way objectoriented programmers think about objects and messages.   Messages are sent to receivers much as letters are delivered to your   home. Message parameters bring information from the outside to the   receiver they dont need to bring the receiver to itself.p blockquote  pI am trying to better understand what they are describing is this like Pythons codeselfcode parameter, or stylep

However my situation is slightly different from other questions Ive seen on this site most people seems to want to create one table per user, when they should create one row per user.p  pSome additional informationp  ul litime series data may contain hundreds of thousands observations, maybe millionsli liema prioriem, saved data should not be modified afterwards. However I guess it would be useful to let users append new data to their time series.li liema prioriem, I wont need to do complicated SQL select statements. I just want to read Bobs weather data and Ill probably use it in the chronological order  although you never know what tomorrow may bring.li liusing PostgreSQL 9.1, if thats of any importance.li ul  pstrongEDITstrong Reading some answers I realize I may have not done my job very well, I should have said that Im clearly already evolving in a SQL environment I already have a User table when I write table I really mean relation all my 4 ideas involve foreign keys somewhere and RDBMS normalization is the paradigm unless something else is better. All this not meaning Im against notsql solutions.p
Negative 6610 pI need to write a swing based editor that can open specified xml files, which contains the text i have to use between a codeltpgtcode and codeltpgtcode tag, but there are other tags in the file too. There are other useless informations in the file.I dont need to display them, but it needs to be preserved. I need to dispay only the text inside the mentioned tags in a codeJTextComponentcode and let the user modifying it and somehow write back the changes to the underlying xml source. The positions of the tags in the xml file will vary from file to file and there are more than one codeltpgtcode tags in a file, and i should display and make editable the content from all of them at once. What do you think Which is the best way to accomplish the above taskp
Negative 6610 pI am developing a cusom component and I would like it to support rich text fields. Possibly the same way it is done in codecomcontentcode. p  pin the form definition I have the following fieldp  precodeltfield         namedescription         typeeditor         labelCOMMYCOMPONENTDESCRIPTIONLABEL         descriptionCOMMYCOMPONENTDESCRIPTIONDESC         classinputbox         filterMyComponentHelperfilterText         buttonstrue     gt codepre  pSo basically what happens is that the editor appears as it is supposed to but the text is saved without formatting. The codeMyComponentHelperfilterTextcode method was added later after investigating codecomcontentcode and copying the codefilterTextcode method to my helper, but it did not work either with or without the line. I even tried to use codeContentHelperfilterTextcode but without success.p
Negative 6610 pThe App Im working on uses AVFoundation to start a video session and apply some image processing. For the processing to work, the lighting conditions must not be too bright the exposure of the camera should not be too high. p  pSo far on all iOS devices, switching from a dark scene like my black table top to a light scene the computer screen, where the images to be processed are displayed takes only up to 23 seconds to adjust exposure.p  pHowever on the iphone4S this takes a lot longer, 56 seconds, which is unacceptable for user experience. Has anyone had the same problem I have tried to play with the 3 camera exposure settingsp  pAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose, p  pAVCaptureExposureModeContinuousAutoExposure,p  pAVCaptureExposureModeLockedp  pby setting it asp  precode    NSError error  nil     NSArray devices  [AVCaptureDevice devicesWithMediaTypeAVMediaTypeVideo]     AVCaptureDevice captureDevice  [devices objectAtIndex0]      if [captureDevice lockForConfigurationamperror]                Setup the device with the necessary settings         if[captureDevice isExposureModeSupportedAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                       captureDevice.exposureMode  AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose                              [captureDevice unlockForConfiguration]          else                handle failure         codepre  pbut the problem remains. The closest I got to a solution is to use AVCaptureExposureModeLocked, but this locks the exposure setting upon camera startup to its current level. This means that if the video is started in light conditions, the image processing works brilliantly, but if the video is started in dark conditions, it is virtually impossible to process anything on a computer screen as it is too bright and obviously the exposure wont adjust.p  pMy question is therefore as follows Is there anyway to set exposure settings on the back camera directly rather than go through exposure modes, and if not, does anything out there exist to speed up exposure adjustmentp  pI find it annoying that the official camera app on iphone4S does not have this problem at all as the exposure there changes in less than 2 seconds from very dark to very light. Thanks very much for any advicep

Negative 6610 pI have a Rails app that uses MongoDb on the back. I have these messages that say codeMONGODB [WARNING] Please note that logging negatively impacts clientside performance. You should set your logging level no lower than info in productioncode in my logs. OK, I never worried about it but decided to look it up just now. p  pa hrefhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSLogging relnofollowThis page on the mongo sitea doesnt really discuss logging levels, but it does discuss codevcode vs codevvvvcode for verbosity. Is that the same thing as log level As in codevvvvvcode is the same as a debug log level and codevcode is the same as an error log level The docs are very unclear on this topic. p
Negative 6610 pIn Qt I have a composite widget that consists of several QLabels arranged inside QBoxLayouts. When the widget is resized I want the label text to scale to fill the label area and I have implemented resizing of the text in the resizeEvent.p  pThis works but there seems to be some sort of feedback loop happening. The composite widget is placed in a main window inside a QBoxLayout along with some other widgets. When the main window is made smaller, the composite widget initially maintains its size and then resizes toward the correct size in several steps  about 1015. If the the text height is set to more than about 0.8 times the label height then on resizing the text and containing widget grow larger with each step until eventually the app crashes.p  pIs this the correct approach to achieve this effect If so, what might the problem be with the resizingp  pBelow is the resizeEvent code.p  precodedef resizeEventself, evt         printresizeEvent, evt.size.width, evt.size.height         QFrame.resizeEventself, evt          dataLabels  self.dataPanels.values          for label in dataLabels                         font  label.font             h  label.height             h2  h  0.8             font.setPixelSizeh2             label.setFontfont codepre  pusing PyQt4 4.8, Qt 4.7.4, Win 7 amp OSX 10.6p

Negative 6610 pBefore you vote or answer, I know that you should use the attributes for XHTML, actually this should be placed in its own .css I am simply trying to understand how it is handled because of the unique results I was getting.p  pI found issues with a few sites I ended up taking on, that ran the CSS with what looked to be no issues at least with the CSS. It was after having a few jquery issues and slow processing that I looked to optimize. I ended up finding a common issue. It was a module holding inline CSS codeltstylegtcode tags without the type attributes. Btw, these are XHTML and not HTML5 sites. Changing the tags by adding attributes or removing the inline CSS looks to correct each site with the problems. p  pMy question is, what is actually happening that would cause an issue to corrupt the process and still allow the CSS to function properly. This is out of pure curiosity and all style has been placed in its own file. These are in a Joomla 1.5 module.p  pTo really detail out one issue that happened more than once was a mask failed to complete its process and happened to be code that followed the inline CSS. So far, this has yet to happen on 80 or so other sites with the same exact code, minus the style error.p

Negative 6610 pIm building an application that will provide a service to other applications lets pretend like it solves differential equations. So my DifEq service will be running all the time and a client application can send it requests to solve DifEqs at any point.p  pThis would be trivial using sockets or pipes.p  pThe problem is some applications nefariously want to send linear equations instead of differential equations, so I want to register applications that I know are sending proper DifEqs to my application.p  pTraditional sockets break down here, as far as I know.p  pIdeally, Id like to be able to look at some information about the application that is making a request of me and either through some metadata on that application, through communication with my web site, or through some other, unkown method determine it is an acceptable DifEq app. Furthermore, this ideal method would not be spoofable without a rootadminlevel compromise of the underlying OS. If the linear equation app is also a root kit, Ill concede to being broken. p  pI need to be able to do this on Windows, OS X, and Linux and maybe Android but I recognize that it may not be the same solution on all platforms.

When you click the close button foo is removed which causes the element bar to move under the current location of the mouse.  However, the mouseenter event does not fire for bar until you move the mouse again.p  pIs there a good way to make it so that bar receives this event immediatelyp  pConsider that in this case you could remove multiple elements by simply clicking repeatedly.  Jittering the mouse in between clicks is a bad user experience.p  pI am aware of several near anwsers that will not work in my case.  p  p1 The closeButton element is not actually contained inside of the foo element that it closes.  This is required to avoid conflict with other scripts on the page and prevents using css hover to display the button initially, which would work a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netPLZJx relnofollowjsfiddlea. p  p2 I know a little about DOMMutationEvents, their deprecation, and relative lack of support and I would like to avoid them and the various timer hacks to emulate them etc.  Im hoping that this problem is specific enough a mouse location related event to fire when the document has reflowed and modified the mouses target.  Especially since obviously the CSS engine knows about it and handles it properly.p  p3 I am using jQuery to modify the page.  I could monkey patch it to fire an event when I call remove and make sure that I true up all my other events.  This could work but the  remove could effect a large piece of the DOM and so it would be difficult to really pass any context into the handler.  As a result I would have to do a lot of extra work, rather than just processing one event for the one element under the mouse.  This might work now but be unmanageable later.p  pThanks for any advice.p

So if the book has and ID of 121 and I am on page 5, the function will then load the image 1215.png.p

Negative 6610 pIm quite new to working with UIImages on the byte level, but I was hoping that someone could point me to some guides on this matterp  pI am ultimately looking to edit the RGBA values of the bytes, based on certain parameters position, color, etc. and I know Ive come across samplestutorials for this before, but I just cant seem to find anything now.p  pBasically, Im hoping to be able to break a UIImage down to its bytes and iterate over them and edit the bytes RGBA values individually. Maybe some sample code here would be a big help as well.p  pIve already been working in the different image contexts and editing the images with the CG power tools, but I would like to be able to work at the byte level.p  pEDITp  pSorry, but I do understand that you cannot edit the bytes in a UIImage directly. I should have asked my question more clearly. I meant to ask how can I get the bytes of a UIImage, edit those bytes and then create a new UIImage from those bytes.p  pAs pointed out by BradLarson, OpenGL is a better option for this and there is a great library, which was created by BradLarson, a hrefhttpsgithub.comBradLarsonGPUImage relnofollowherea.

Negative 6610 pIn the game that I am currently producing, I have two shadersp  ul lione for sprites on a texture atlas andli lione particle shaped texture which is loaded separately. I decided to keep this texture out of the atlas as the particles in my generator are GLPOINTS.li ul  pCurrently, I bind each one of these to a separate Texture unit and then set the uniform of each shader to the respective texture units.

Negative 6610 pIm trying to design a REST API over HTTP. I am totally new to this, so please tell me if any of my assumptions or ideas are just plain wrong. p  pThe domain is minimalistic. I have a database of Products and for each Product there is an associated Image. As I see it, I can design my API in one of two waysp  ol lipI can bundle each image with its product and represent them as one resource. The cons of this api would be that every time you PUT or GET a product, you have to send the image over the wire, even if you dont specifically need to read or change the image. As of my understanding, it would not be RESTful to not PUT or GET a strongcompletestrong representation of a resource. Also, clientside caching of images would be of no use in this scenario.pli lipI can model Products and Images as two different resources. When you GET a Product, it will contain an imageid which can be used to GET an Image. This model would require two HTTP Requests. One to GET the Product and one to GET its corresponding Image. Not so bad maybe, but what if I want to display a list of all Products along with their Images Then I suddenly have a bunch of HTTP Requests. While using SSL, I guess this could create a performance issue. Good thing though, is that the consumer of my API could choose to cache images clientside.pli ol  pSo, how can I model my API to be both RESTful and efficientp
Negative 6610 pSo the game works fine and all but I have noticed that in extremely rare circumstances the app crashes in random places. I did my debugging and my theory is that because touch events on the surface are handled in the apps UI Thread and the game updates happen in a separate thread looping thread or whatever its called, these two are stepping on each others feet. My solution was to synchronize the touch events on the surfacep  precodeOverride public boolean onTouchEventMotionEvent event      synchronized this.gameLoopingThread          Handle touch events here         return true       codepre  pwith the games updates in the looping threadp  precodeOverride public void run      while this.running          synchronized this              doUpdate                  doDraw       codepre  pSo Im wondering, is it OK for me to do this Im not great yet on multithreaded apps so someone please tell me if this solves my problem since I cant really verify because the issue doesnt happen often enough has happened only twice. And if so, shouldnt we do this on every game we implement Tutorials I have seen everywhere online never do this. Is there a reasonp

Negative 6610 pI have a multithreaded program whose thread number could be customized. The program is responsible for generating HTTP requests, sending the requests to a web service, receiving response and parsing the response to get some result value. p  pSince it takes almost 1 sec for each request to get the response, to make the program get as many responses as possible, multiple threads are started. p  pFollowing code is used to start multithreads p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode    ...     for int i  0 i lt threadNum i          threadArray[i]  new ThreadrequestGeneratorArray[i]         threadArray[i].start           for int i  0 i lt threadNum i          try              threadArray[i].join          catch InterruptedException e              logger.errore               codepre  p...p  pWhen the thread number is 50, and totally 10K requests are generated and sent, the program works well. When the thread number is still 50, and the total request number is 100K. The program was hanging when 95K requests were sent. No exception existed, and the program just hanging there. p  pAnd then I add a few JVM arguments like this java Xmx1024M Xms512M XXMaxPermSize256m ... With such arguments, 50 threads 100K request worked. However, 50 threads 1M requests was hanging again. I set the thread number to 20 and request number as 1M, it worked again.p  pI want to set the thread number to 50, since as tested with fewer requests number 10K, 50 threads makes the highest efficiency. The request number could be much larger as 10M, 100M, event 1B. In this cases, it would not be a good idea to increase the size of Xmx Xms or MaxPermSize. What should I do Whats the root cause of program hanging p  pp  pI used Executor Service instead of threads directly. But the problem occurred as well. I rechecked the code, and found there is a mistake  I instantiated a HttpClient object for each request. I changed the code to instantiated a HttpClient instance for each thread, and the program doesnt hang anymore. p  pI think the root cause of program hanging is that it set up too many HTTP connections to the web service, and used out all threads of the web service. That made the web service cannot answer to any new arrived requests. Is it correct   p

Id like to display each song showing its title and artwork if any exists, and then if they choose to download that track, theyll be able to click a button and download that track from the downloadurl.p  pSo heres what Ive realized for most tracks or sounds, as they are called in Soundcloud, downloading is disabled by default when you upload it.  The thing is, there is also an option that says Apps EnabledDisabled.  What Im wondering is if downloading for a song is disabled, can a 3rd party application that has been authenticated still use the download URL to grab the track  Id like to know if users will need to individually go through all their tracks and enable downloading in order for this to work.p  pIf you need any more detail, please say so.

Negative 6610 pIm having trouble with the ASP.NET Web API routing. Specifically I want to pass a string parameter that is either empty or containing a slash within the Uri. But unfortunately this breaks the routing.p  pI already have a proper route set up, which is matching fine if I have a normal string such as fubar. I tried to pass the string url encoded, but this does not work. Apparently the problem is that some http sys layer is already decoding the string, meaning not codefu2fbarcode arrives, but codefobarcode  which leads to another route. p  pAlso when I pass an empty string the uri is codeapi...code, the two codecode are merged and the segment is thrown away.p  pOne method to solve the issue with the codecode inside is to double encode the Uri and decode it inside my method. But this seems like a very very bad option, so Im looking for other methods on how I could solve this problem.p

Now, if the xvalue of the point is greater than the rightpoint, and if the Entity is walking to the right, its overwritten. The same happens with leftPoint leftest point, ceiling and floor. Then I check if any of these points have been changed, if they have that means we collided with the terrain so we bounce them back. For example, say the Entity is walking to the right and we collided with the terrain, rightPoint have been written with the rightest point we collided with so then we set the coordinate so that the Entity is right beside the point that it collided with.p  pIf one would only go at one direction at a time, this would work perfectly, but weird things happen when you take multiple inputs into account.p  pExample the Entity walks, flat to the floor, towards a ledge on the right, when the Entity is halfway over the ledge, it wants to go down, so both right and down are pressed, what my code will do is check the inputs, put the Entity where it wants to be and then bounce it back if it hit terrain, so it will see that I press right and bounce the Entity back to the end of the ledge.p  pThis is all my own idea of how terraincollision could work, I couldnt find anything online except how to check if a collision took place, but nothing that covers this. Any idea what could make my solution work, or a pointer to how terraincollision should be donep

Negative 6610 pIm trying to draw areas of transparency onto a bitmap  like cutting holes in the image.p  pThe following code does not draw a line of transparency because drawing a transparent line onto a bitmap of course blends instead of replaces. Why the default is to do the more complicated of the two drawing operations, makes no sense.p  precodeBitmap myBitmap  new Bitmap50, 50 Graphics g  Graphics.FromImagemyBitmap g.FillRectangleBrushes.Black, 0, 0, 50, 50 g.FillEllipseBrushes.Transparent, 25, 0, 25, 25 Does nothing g.DrawLinePens.Transparent, 0, 0, 50, 50 Does nothing codepre  pHow would I modify this so that a transparent circle and line replace whats in the bitmap instead of blendingp  pNote that this is the trivial case of drawing complete transparency. The end Im going toward is the ability to draw modifying the alpha channel only without creating my own pixel by pixel operation. Being able to do complete transparency will suffice though.p  hr  pFollowing answer in article suggested as a duplicate, Ive also tried the following which does not workp  precode        base.OnPainte         Bitmap myBitmap  new Bitmap50, 50         e.Graphics.FillRectangleBrushes.Black, 0, 0, 50, 50         Graphics g  Graphics.FromImagemyBitmap         g.FillEllipsenew SolidBrushColor.FromArgb150, 125, 125, 125, 25, 0, 25, 25         g.DrawLinenew PenColor.FromArgb150,25,25,25, 0, 0, 50, 50         g.CompositingMode  System.Drawing.Drawing2D.CompositingMode.SourceOver         e.Graphics.CompositingMode  System.Drawing.Drawing2D.CompositingMode.SourceOver         e.Graphics.DrawImagemyBitmap, 0, 0 codepre  palso tested this with codeSourceCopycodep

Negative 6610 pIm trying to write a Scala compiler plugin that will allow extremely general code generation something like the generality of the C preprocessor, but a bit more typesafe Im not sure if this is a terrible idea, but its a fun exercise. My ideal use case looks something like thisp  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecode User code. This represents some function that might take some args  and outputs an abstract syntax tree. def createFooTree... scala.reflect.runtime.universe.Tree  ...   Later user code maybe separate compilation.

The function.toString bit matches anything that looks like a              function call with a function called insertTree.             treeClosure if function.toString  insertTree gt               This function evaluates and returns the Tree, inserting it              into the call site as automaticallygenerated code.              Unfortunately, the following line isnt valid.             evaltreeClosure Tree                 ... codepre  pAny idea how to do this Please dont say just use macros at least in 2.10, they arent general enough.p  pBTW, I see two problems with the approach Ive outlined 1 The compiler plugin takes an AST, not a closure. It would need some way of creating the closure, probably adding a build dependency on the user code. 2 The user doesnt have access to scala.reflect.internal.Trees.Tree, only scala.reflect.runtime.universe.Tree, so the plugin would need to translate between the two.p

Negative 6610 pI am currently trying to make the scrolling of my GridView smoother by moving some work from the UIthread into other threads, but I get strange behavior sometimes one image is drawn to more then one view. I am using Xamarin C.p  pBelow you can find the simplyfied version of my current code. LoadShowImageAsync is called from within the GetView in my gridview Adapter. If I call LoadShowImageDoWork singlethreaded everything is fine but when I call it via the ThreadPool it shows the strange behaviour.

Negative 6610 pIm trying to convert an application to Backbone Marionette and am running into a problem rendering a collection of items that each contains multiple sub collections.p  pThe Backgroundp  pI am working on an address book app, mostly for my own edification but also hopefully of use to others. The main screen in this app displays a list of the users contacts. Each of those contacts is represented by a view with a single model backing it. Each of those models has additional relational information stored as a collection on a property on the model. That is, phone numbers and email addresses are each stored as a collection on each contact. These relations are all back by Backbone Relational and It Is Good.p  pThe Problemp  pMy first thought when attempting to convert the contact view from Backbone.View to Marionette was to use Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView, but the composite view only takes a single collection. What is the Right Way to render a repeating item that has multiple collections to itp

Negative 6610 pBackground  I use PHPStylist to indent PHP code, which is generally working out fine. But, when it find function calls with many arguments, it puts all these arguments on one single line. So for instance a codebindparamcode call can easily be 300 characters wide.p  pThis does not play well with our coding style guide, which dictates a maximum line length of 180 characters.p  pOur indent script already has a sed command to clean off trailing whitespace left by PHPStylist, so I was thinking, can sed also break too long lines, but only on a comma p  pExample inputp  precodefunction xyz      somecallsomevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1  codepre  pExample outputp  precodefunction xyz      somecallsomevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1  codepre  psup Bonus points if the script could also indent the next line prettily, but I think that would be very hard to do in sed.  A solution in awk, perl, python or other common tool would be very appreciated too.supp

Negative 6610 pIve run into this need before. Right now, I have a function that is called every 0.1 seconds to check on how much time has elapsed. If it exceeds the total time which it retrieves from the codegetTotalTimecode function it stops. The codegetTotalTimecode method is overridden in the children. The code for the function called every 0.1 seconds is also overridden, but the original method in the parent class that uses codegetTotalTimecode is called using codesupercode, only it needs to call the childs method of codegetTotalTimecode instead of its own. This is, of course, the issue. I could rewrite the code from the parent in each of the children, but that seems stupid. Some Google searching has show solutions in other languages, but not in ObjectiveC. Is there a way to do this If not, what are some alternativesp

Negative 6610 pI recognise that sounds a bit mad but to explain what I meanp  pI have a codeCollectioncode eg HashSet containing several quite slow initialisation objects and I want to see if the codeCollectioncode already contains a particular object. Lets use codeVector3dcode as an example I know that is not expensive to initialise.p  pSo the codeCollectioncode containsp  precodeVector3d1,1,1 Vector3d2,1,1 Vector3d3,1,1 codepre  pAnd I want to ask the codeCollectioncode the question does the codeCollectioncode contain a codeVector3dcode with codex2code, codey1code and codez1code i.e. I already know the data the code.containscode method would hash against. So I could create a new codeVector3d2,1,1code and then use code.containscode on that but as I said the objects initialisation is slow, or I could run through the entire codeCollectioncode manually checking which is what Im doing now but thats as I understand it slower than code.containscode since it doesnt use hash. Is there a better way to do thisp  pThe objects in question are mutable but the data that the codeequalscode method is based upon is not. In my case they are blocks at x,y,z coordinates, the contents of the blocks may change but the x,y,z coordinates will notp

Negative 6610 pIve created a form which is basically just a big calculator so that someone can input how many of each item they have in their house and which will tell them by m3 how many storage units theyll need for those items. This works perfectly fine and is all good but what I also want to do is allow the user to go to book online from that information. If they choose to and click on the link it goes to a page with another comprehensive form. What I want to be able to do is the data from the first form to be passed through to the booking form in the background so that when the booking form is submitted not only is the booking information sent through to the email but the inventory information from the first form is submitted with it.p  pSo there are these pages estimator.html  which is the first form where you input numbers to calculate how much space you need. estimate.php  this does the calculations with the data put in the first form and prints out how many storage units you need. bookonline.php  this is the form where you put your booking information into. book.php  this is the mailing page which sends all of the information from the book online page and sends it to my email.p  pSo far, from my research, I have done tried to in the estimate.php page. make a new invisible form which puts the data from the first form into a new form with hidden fields. Then, in the bookonline.php page I have tried to get the data that should be in this hidden form on the previous page and prints it. Obviously I dont want it to print in the final product, I want to be able to send it in the book.php page with the rest of the things but I am just testing it for now. This is obviously not working and nothing is printing.p  pI hope someone can help because Im really stuck with itp

Negative 6610 pJust getting started with data binding in C and looking for some help. The below binding statements break Visible property stops toggling with MyBool amp MyBoolInverse when the line binding SelectedItem of the combo box to MyEnumVar of the BusinessObject executes.

So its not needed to explicitly clear the multimap.Please correct me if i am wrong.li liIn parent class it just declares the destructor and does not have any definition.So will it call implicit destructor or it will ignore calling itThere is no reason of not defining it, just asking for better understanding. li liIf it calls implicit destructor in case of parent class, should it call the child class destructor which is defined hereli liAs the parent class object is instantiated using new, it would be created in heap.Then where exactly the member variables of this parent object would be stored.For example object a is a member variable and by looking into the declaration of this member object,  seems like it would be created in stack.

The codecvtsd2sscode operation is apparently an instruction that a hrefhttpwww.asmpedia.orgindex.phptitleCVTSD2SS relnofollowconvert double precision floating point value to single precision floating point valuea but I couldnt find what this instruction actually does.

Can anyone point me in the right direction or propose a solution to this problem I dont know if such an algorithm exists.p  pSince I need to implement this algorithm myself, there is a tradeoff between the complexity of the algorithm and ease of implementation.p  pUpdate I added an example shape below. The part with diagonal lines is the final shape and the dotted rectangle is the starting aluminum block. The machine needs to remove all of the aluminum with the exception of the diagonal area.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0Z3pE.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 6610 pThe main difficultly in this situation is a out of disk space error from the Greenplum database. We are running a Greenplum Database 4.2.0.0 on a Amazon Linux box.p  pThe investigation has presented the followingp  p1 Greenplum says we are low on space.

Negative 6610 pWhat is the significance of data being passed as keyvalue pairs to the mapper also in the Hadoop Map Reduce framework. I understand that keyvalue pairs hold significance when they are passed to the reducers as they cater to the partitioning of data coming from the mappers. Values belonging to the same key go as a list from the mapper to the reducer stage. But how are the keys used before the mapper stage itself What happens to values belonging to the same key If we dont define a custom input format, I presume Hadoop takes in the record number from the input file as the key and the text line as the value in the mapper function. But in case we decide to implement a custom input format there is a custom selection of the keys and there could be a possibility where we have values corresponding to the same key.p  pHow does phenomenon get handled in the mapper stage Does the mapper ignore duplicate records and treats them as separate records or does it only choose one record per keyp

Negative 6610 pI have a typical problem which I suppose can be handled quite easily in Java.p  pI have a shopping queue mainly two, express and normal. And then there are customers normal and priority. Priority customers are assigned express lane if it is free else they can queue in express lane. Express lane as name suggest takes 1 min to process item and normal lane take couple of min to process an item.p  pNow lets suppose time start at zero and in first min a normal customer arrives with 5 items, He should be assigned to normal lane and should checkout in 10 min. In the mean time in 5th min priority customer comes with 2 items then he should be assigned to express lane and should be processed in 2 min.p  pSome thoughts, direction, pointers around this typical threads queue related problem would be great.p

Negative 6610 pI have a codeajaxToolKitTabContainercode on my website. I have strongthreestrong tabs that every codeProductcode populates in some form or another Description, Additional Information, Reviews. I also have strongthreestrong other tabs that are dynamically created, and loaded into the tab container if the products strongemmeet certain criteriaemstrong. I am running into a problem when I load in those three dynamic tabs though. p  pWhen I load the tabs, the text from the codeDescriptioncode tab shows in all the other tabs until I click on the codeDescriptioncode tab, it then disappears from all the other tabs. p  pIt happens in all the browsers that I really care about Chrome, IE, FF. The codehtmlcode markup, when you view the source, has the text within the correct codedivcode and codetab panelcode but it is displaying incorrectly for some reason.p  pHere is how I load the controls in the Code behind and add them the containerp  precode            TabPanel overviewTab  new TabPanel              ProductOverviewInfo control  ProductOverviewInfoPage.LoadControlControlsProductOverviewInfo.ascx             control.overviewpopulate              overviewTab.Controls.Addcontrol             overviewTab.HeaderText  OVERVIEW             ProductTabs.Controls.AddAtfirstVisibleTab, overviewTab codepre  pcodefirstVisibleTabcode is just an int value deciding where I want to insert the tab.p  pNow, I found a fix for this but it is not what I want and not what my project sponsor wants either. If I just use codeProductTabs.Control.Addtabcode then I dont have the problem. BUT if the product meets the criteria to have an overview tab the code above I want that tab to be active. p  pNow, you may ask, why dont you just use the code.Addtabcode and then have the codeActiveTabIndexcode be where you inserted the new tab. Well, I tried that and for some reason when I would do the check or just add it in directly in the code above the whole codeTabContainercode would not display, at all. p  pSo in about half of the products I am working with I have the problem of this text showing in the wrong tab, the other half doesnt have the problem because there is no overview tab or the other 2 dynamically loaded tabs present.p

Negative 6610 pI have a multithreaded server that waits for a set of parameters sampled from multiple clients and sent to the server. Each client periodically sends its parameters to the server thread to which it is connected. Another thread possibly ServerManager that instantiates the individual ThreadServer for managing the connection with the client must wait for the reception of the parameters from all clients and only after executing the rest. What could be the synchronization mechanism most appropriate to analyze the reception of the updated parameters from all clients connected to the server side assuming to have a fixed number of clients The most obvious solution would be to conduct a polling on an array indicating the current status of the parameters ... but I think it would be better with condition variables, for example, or something like that.

Negative 6610 pI just started using Sprite Kit, and have an issue with loading textured sprites.p  pI created a new project with the Sprite Kit template in Xcode, and wanted to add a simple sprite with an image file as the texture. Here is the code I used in the scenes init method p  precodeSKSpriteNode myNode  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamedmyimagefile] myNode.position  CGPointMake100, 100 [self addChildmyNode] codepre  pI didnt add the extension to the image name, so my file is named myimagefile.png, but I omitted the .png at the end. I also moved the Scene creation to the viewWillLayoutSubviews method, as suggested in a number of tutorials.p  pI ran the project in the simulator using retina iPhone as the device, and to my surprise, the sprite appeared twice as big as I expected, and with quite big pixels too. It looked like as if I was using a nonretina iPhone. As far as I can tell the Apple Adventure example app uses the same naming conventions, and the sprites appear just fine there.p  pI renamed my file myimagefile2x.png, and it all worked fine, the sprite appeared as I expect it to look on a retina display. Since I have quite a few image files, I prefer not to rename them all, and it all works fine in the Apple Adventure app without the 2x postfix anyway.p  pIt also works fine if I explicitly define the size of the texture using this method on SKSpriteNode p  precode instancetypespriteNodeWithTextureSKTexture texture sizeCGSizesize codepre  pI cleaned the project and deleted the app from the simulator between each run, so I assume this is not an issue with stuck or missing image files.p  pI also tried searching the Internet to see how Sprite Kit texture file naming conventions work, but I couldnt find any documentation regarding the issue.p  pCan someone please explain briefly how it works, or at least show me a solution that doesnt involve renaming all my image files, or defining the size explicitly for all my spritesp  pThanks, utrp

Ive seen many ways to do it here but none of them worked for me. Im using a codeUINavigationControllercode and changing view controllers with push segues if that is any help, and Im creating an mutable array in one view controller and trying to read it in the next view controller.

Negative 6610 pIm having a problem with the query builder in MS Access 2010. Im not able to join two tables where one has two references to the other. I have one table, Workers, with two columns, HumanFactor1 and HumanFactor2. Both of these point to table HumanFactors which consists of only two fields, ID and HumanFactor. This table is used to populate two combobox selectors for the user, and those selections are then stored as FKs in Worker.p  pUsing the query builder, it automatically creates the following SQLp  precodeSELECT Incident., Worker. FROM HumanFactors RIGHT JOIN  Incident LEFT JOIN Worker ON Incident.ID  Worker.IncidentID ON  HumanFactors.ID  Worker.HumanFactor2 AND HumanFactors.ID  Worker.HumanFactor1 WHERE HumanFactors.HumanFactorFatigue codepre  pThis doesnt work, because those two are always going to be different in practice, so the only returned results are records where Ive forced both HumanFactors to be the same. This is incredibly easy to fix via SQL by simply changing to an OR expressionp  precodeSELECT Incident., Worker. FROM HumanFactors RIGHT JOIN  Incident LEFT JOIN Worker ON Incident.ID  Worker.IncidentID ON  HumanFactors.ID  Worker.HumanFactor2 OR HumanFactors.ID  Worker.HumanFactor1 WHERE HumanFactors.HumanFactorFatigue codepre  pThis gives me exactly what Im looking for, but I cant figure out how to create an OR instance in the Builder. The application freaks out when I try and go back to design view.p  pIs there a way to handle this via the builder without resorting to changing the SQL My users refuse to do anything more complicated than dragampdrop. Or will I have to create a linking table in between My problem there is that while a linking table makes the query builder work perfectly fine, Im at a loss to reconnect the data to the controls. There are only two comboboxes, instead of one list that you would expect for that setup. Thanks.p

Negative 6610 pIve been banging my head on this one all day, and I just cant make sense of the various sometimes conflicting documentation on this. To add to the confusion, at some point during the day, this did sort of work  i.e. didnt throw an access violation error. But the data at the other end of the pipe was nonsense, so I suspect it only worked by accident.p  pI have a vb.net program using .net 3.0 so no support for System.IO.NamedPipes   which creates a named pipe and waits for another app to connect and send some data. As an ack, I then want the vb program to send back the total length of the message received.

Negative 6610 pI need help understanding DDD approach to the following issue please. Ive been searching the Internet for days now and, not sure if I understand terminology right, but there seems to be no similar issues discussed at all.p  pI have interface where user can add items to a list, lets call them Messages. Message content should be updated periodically from external source such as file, Web API or other. Therefore, when creating a new Message user has an option to select Connector type i.e. FileConnector and enter required configuration like file path or url. Each connector type would have different parameters. As well, there is a big chance that new types will be added in the future.p  pCurrently my domain model looks like thisp  precodepublic class Message    public string Content  get set    public Connector Connector  get set     public void Update        this.Content  this.Connector.ReadData      public abstract class Connector    public Device Device  get set    public abstract string ReadData   public class FileConnector  Connector    public string Path  get set     public override string ReadData        read the file and return its content      public class WebConnector  Connector    public string URI  get set    public string Username  get set    public string Password  get set     public override string ReadData        connect to Web API and return the result     codepre  pHere Message.Update will be executed using some sort of scheduler job.p  pThe problem is that I dont feel confident implementing connection to a file or Web API directly from the domain. I would like to extract such implementation to something like a service. But does it mean I have to have different service for each connection type If so, how should I go about using them within the domain That is, how can I inject the correct service based on connector type when Update method is executed on Message object What other option do I havep  pAlso, I would be interested to know if there is alternative to inheritance in this case.p  pP.S. Domain persistence will be done using Entity Framework.p

But my RSA public key is in NSData variable. So how can i convert NSData to SecKeyRef object type. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 6610 pHere is my issue in a project I have to consume 3 thirdparty wcf services. 2 of those contain the same objects and largely the same methods. p  pThe users role within the application determines which service to use. For example Lets say the 2 services are ServiceRoleA en ServiceRoleB. Both services contain the method GetInfo end return the InfoDetails object. The InfoDetails object has the exact same signature for both services.p  pIf I just add 2 service references to my project Ill get the objects ServiceRolaA.InfoDetails and ServiceRoleB.InfoDetails. Instead, I need just one object InfoDetails. I only want to write just one routine to handle the InfoDetails etc.p  pMy initial thought was to create an assembly with the datacontracts of the services and reference the assembly in my project. This way the service references can use the common set of objects. For this to work I have create the datacontract classes using svcutil and the wsdl, but I get error upon error.p  pWhen I try the followingp  blockquote   psvcutil .wsdl dataContractOnly  n,DataContracts   languageC outXxxData.csp blockquote  pI get the following errorp  pError Type AuthenticationBase in namespace a hrefhttpschemas.datacontract.org200407xxx relnofollowhttpschemas.datacontract.org200407xxxa cannot be imported.

Either change the schema so that the types can map to data contract types or use ImportXmlType or use a different serializer.p  pIf you are using the dataContractOnly option to import data contract types andare getting this error message, consider using xsd.exe instead. Types generatedby xsd.exe may be used in the Windows Communication Foundation after applying the XmlSerializerFormatAttribute attribute on your service contract. Alternatively, consider using the importXmlTypes option to import these types as XML types to use with DataContractFormatAttribute attribute on your service contract.p  pExporting the datacontracts as XML types is no option for my so the next thing to try wasp  blockquote   blockquote     psvcutil .wsdl dataContractOnly  n,DataContracts     serializerXmlSerializer languageC outXxxData.csp   blockquote blockquote  pWhich resulted in the exact same error. So I decided to try the other mentioned option to use XSD.exe. But that is also nog working since I only have a WSDL and XSD.exe requires a XSD file. Are there any more options I can try Please helpp

batteries,bodyA sign stands outside the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn

runner a fraction of a second sooner than the others That s just enough to matter and why the latest starting pistol has traded in the mechanical boom for orchestrated electronic noise Omega has been the watch company tasked as the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932 At the 2010 Vancouver games they debuted their new starting gun which is a far cry from the iconic revolvers associated with early games it s clearly electronic but still more than a button that s pressed to get the show rolling About as far away as you can get probably while still clearly being a starting gun Pull the trigger once and off the Olympians go If it s pressed twice consecutively it signals a false start Working through a speaker system is what eliminates any kind of advantage for athletes It s not a big advantage being close to a gun but the sound of the bullet traveling one meter every three milliseconds could contribute to a win Powder pistols have been connected to a speaker system before but even then runners could react to the sound of the real pistol firing rather than wait for the speaker sounds to reach them This year s setup will have speakers placed equidistant from runners forcing the sound to reach each competitor at exactly the same time It wouldn t be an enormous difference Omega Timing board member Peter Hu00fcrzeler said in an email but when you think about reaction times being measured in tiny fractions of a second placing a speaker behind each lane has eliminated any sort of advantage for any athlete They all hear the start commands and signal at exactly the same moment There s also an ulterior reason for its look In a post September 11th world a gun on its way to a major event is going to raise more than a few TSA eyebrows even if it s a realistic looking fake Rather than deal with that the e gun can be transported while still maintaining the general look of a starting gun But there s still nothing like hearing a starting gun go off at the start of a race more than signaling the runners there s probably some Pavlovian response after more than a century of Olympic games that make people want to hear the real thing not a whiny electronic noise Everyone in the stands at home thankfully will still be getting that The sound is programmable and can be synthesized to sound like almost anything Hu00fcrzeler says but we program it to sound like a pistol it s a way to use the best possible starting technology but to keep a rich tradition alive and that can be carried on a plane without the hassle, too technology,gadgets,london

Negative 6610 pIm pretty new to Mercurial but it seems that when two commits exist with the same parent it automatically creates a branch, but for some reason it gives them the same name in SourceTree anyway. This isnt a problem until you have to administer one of the open branches say for some reason I want to close one no matter which branch I try to close it always applies the command to the same one. The only way to close the other one is to do it through terminal commands, which is pretty annoying. Am I doing something wrong here in my workflow or is that just a bug in SourceTreep
Negative 6610 pA coworker of mine noticed that a page I had built was displaying incorrectly because he had increased his font size in Chrome to large.p  pI realized that I had not specified a default font for the page. When I did this, it overrode his browser settings and displayed the text at the size I had specified. Now, he can see the page, but the text is not the large font that he wanted.p  pIs it possible to design the page in such a way that my divs and containers respond to browser settings like this In other words, is there a way to increase the size of a div IF the user has increased their default font size in their browser settings p  pMy instincts tell me this is impossible, because CSS media queries respond to window size. Im hoping someone can either enlighten me on this topic or confirm my suspicions.p

Negative 6610 pSo Im about to hang up the gloves and give up, but before that Im going to try StackOverflow. p  h2What Im trying to achieveh2  pIm building an app where one of its functionalities is to create new DOM elements mostly styled divs and inject those elements in the current document. The injection is done via a drag and drop functionality user creates the div, drags it to the place where he wants it emother elements in the area get out of the wayem, and releases it, thus fixing the div in the place where it was dropped. To give an example, it would be something like this a hrefhttpvimeo.com54413541t0m42s relnofollowhttpvimeo.com54413541t0m42sap  h2The problemh2  pWith JQuery UI, I have been able to add all the drag and drop functionality. However, I cannot achieve the part of emother elements in the area get out of the wayem. Now, this would be fairly easy if I could control the currentparent document. In such a case, I would simply use JQuery UIs sortable behavior. But the currentparent document is also created by the user copypasting HTML, scrapping remote HTML, etc.. So, there is no way I can add JQuerys UI sortable behavior to HTML that can vary each time. strongSo, in short, I want to take a newlycreated element, drag it over arbitrary HTML, push other elements in the vicinity out of the way mostly in vertical axis, and finally inject the newlycreated element in the area when the user releases the mouse.strong Again a hrefhttpvimeo.com54413541t0m42s relnofollowhttpvimeo.com54413541t0m42sap  h2What I have triedh2  pI have tried all sorts of combination with JQuerys UI draggable, droppable, and sortable behaviors. The main obstacle here is that the HTML is arbitrary, so I cannot think make this list of divs sortable, since I dont know if there will be a list of divs.p  pI also tried creating a placeholder div above the current hovered element, so that this placeholder makes space for the dragged div. But this resulted in crappy behavior and very bad results.p  pSolutions in JQuery, JQueryUI, or a similar nifty library are preferred.p

Negative 6610 pIm not sure I can adequately explain my dilemma, but here goes...p  pOur company has its own web server at xyz.com. I have a Win 7 Pro machine running a nonHTTP server program that communicates with an iPhone app used by our field crews. The path to this machine from outside the network is abc.xyz.com, and its set for port 5000. The app, then, is programmed to exchange data ASCII only with the server at abc.xyz.com5000. The server program is written in VB, and the system works very well like that.p  pWhat I would like to do now is to add IIS to this same machine and open it on port 5001, so I can run asp.net pages that will enhance the functionality of the app for our crews. The URL would be abc.xyz.com5001, and they will access it through their phone browsers.p  pI have IIS 7.5 installed on the machine, and I have started it running with the default web site, and I have the binding set for port 5001. So far I am able to access the IIS Welcome page only from the same machine. I cant get it to come up on any other machine either inside or outside the network.p  pIn searching for clues for this problem, all I read indicates that its pretty much a snap to get a web server running on your Windows 7 machine. But it hasnt been so much a snap for me. Ive checked the sharing settings and the security settings, they seem to be ok, as best I can tell.p  pI am hoping that someone will help me identify some obscure setting somewhere that I am overlooking and get this going. But I also even wonder if this is something that cant be done, i.e. because theres another server program using the same path running on port 5000.p  pBy the way, I am not the network administrator. I try to avoid getting him involved because hes difficult to work with. I am hoping that this is just between me and my server.p  pThanks for any insight anyone can give me.p

Negative 6610 pToday I came across a rather weird phenomenon. When developing a Rails app in which every user has his own subdomain, and trying to use Devise to do it, I encountered that also subdomains not registered whatsoever would route to the root page. So, for example, even if there was no explicit subdomain, it would route me to the main application page. Maybe this has to do with my particular setup I also tried with a new Rails project, but I got the same result. Anyone able to clarify this for me Railscasts didnt do the trick.p  pAlso, right now Im using WEBrick, even though thats not what Ill be using in production, and Im using the domain lvh.me to access the subdomains.p  pThanks for the help. p  pEDIT Heres my routes.rb filep  precodeRails.application.routes.draw do     devisefor users     root staticpageindex end codepre  pI followed this guide from the Devise wiki a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowtoScopelogintosubdomain relnofollowhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowtoScopelogintosubdomainap  pSo what I did was I removed the uniqueness of the email through a migration, and next I added subdomain to requestkeys as followsp  precodedevise databaseauthenticatable, recoverable, rememberable, trackable, timeoutable, requestkeys [subdomain] codepre  pThen I went on to override the findforauthentication function, as per the followingp  precodedef self.findforauthenticationconditions     conditions[accountid]  Account.findbysubdomainconditions.deletesubdomain.id     superconditions end codepre  pAnd that just about sums it up.p  pEDIT Ive been messing around, and Ive found the problem. The root directive refers all subdomains to my domain. So if I remove the root from my routes.rb, strongeverystrong subdomain leads to a RouteError. I remember about needing a root somewhere in my app for Devise. So Im not sure if this is Devises behaviour or roots. p

Negative 6610 pI have implemented an inline codeUIDatePickercode in a codeUITableViewcode just like they appear in other iOS apps, for example when creating a new event in Calendar.p  pWhile using the app with VoiceOver, the date picker is still accessible after the user selected a date and then closed the date picker by double tapping when on the table view cell. When the date picker hides, VoiceOver highlights the appropriate cell, but if the user then swipes to the right it will select the now hidden codeUIDatePickercode and allow them to interact with it. I expected it to select the next table view cell like it does in Calendar.p  pI have read on other SO questions that hidden views are still accessible, and in order to prevent that from occurring, you can set the property codeaccessibilityElementsHiddencode to codeYEScode on the container view after you hide the element to let VoiceOver know its no longer on screen. But this did not work for me. I also read you should post a layout change notification so VoiceOver knows to update to the current UI, but that too didnt work and the hidden view is still accessible.p  pstrongHow can I prevent my hidden codeUIDatePickercode from being accessiblestrong Note that when the table loads, the hidden date picker is not accessible.

Negative 6610 pIt seems there are 2 options for displaying interstitial ads using iAds on iPhone. The documentation on interstitials is out of date, but according to the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiAdReferenceUIViewControlleriAdAdditionsReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccinstmUIViewControllerrequestInterstitialAdPresentation relnofollowiAds Additions Referencea all one needs to do to set up is p  precode[UIViewController prepareInterstitialAds] [self setInterstitialPresentationPolicyADInterstitialPresentationPolicyManual] codepre  pfollowed by p  precode[self requestInterstitialAdPresentation] codepre  pwhich returns a bool if successful whenever youd like to display an ad. p  pThe other options is to manually create an interstitial ad objectp  precodeADInterstitialAd interstitial codepre  pThen p  precodeinterstitial  [[ADInterstitialAd alloc] init] interstitial.delegate  self codepre  pAnd when you want to show an ad p  precodeif interstitial.isLoaded      [interstitial presentFromViewControllerself]  codepre  pHowever PresentViewController is deprecated, and using presentInViewself.view means the ad doesnt have a close button. The compiler also suggests requestInterstitalAdPresentation. p  pSo one would assume option 1 is the preferred approach. Im a little confused by the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20741622iadsinterstitialadvertsoniphonethis questiona as it uses a combination of the 2, but it seems requestInterstitalAdPresentation doesnt trigger the delegate methods of the ADInterstitialAd instance and using both is pointless. p  pSo my question is  is the first approach really sufficient Ive found it only displays one ad, and then fails to display any more. I read in another question that the ADInterstitialAd instance needs to be assigned to nil in order to request a new ad, but then requestInterstitialAdPresentation ignores this instance anyway. Is requestInterstitialAdPresentation just simulating low fill rates Or am I missing a step p

It works but I want to speed it up more. An idea is to store the data on Amazon ElastiCache using e.g. Redis or Memcache. The problem I have is how would one go with this approach Redis as well as Memcache uses key  values making it, in my opinion, difficult to store an IP range as well as the country code. What approach would you suggest for using ElastiCache Memcache or Redisp  pThe country range would be something likep  ul li192.168.1.1  192.168.1.100 Country Ali li192.168.2.1  192.168.2.50 Country Bli li192.168.1.150  192.168.1.200 Country Ali ul  pNow I get the IP address e.g. 192.168.1.160, I need to look this up as fast as possible and return in this case Country A.p  pLooking forward to your ideas.p  pMarcp

Negative 6610 pI have RecyclerView which contains multiple Views around 30 where each of them is pageheight long.p  pEach page inside RecyclerView contains views that can be also scrolled horizontally around 20 views in 1st horizontal scroll view and around 10 views in 2nd horizontal scroll view.p  pWhich means that each RecyclerView creates around 30 views and inflates them every time view is created. This is very, very slow.p  precode     forint i  0 i lt 10 i              View details  LayoutInflater.fromparent.getContext.inflateR.layout.details, parent, false             viewHolder.container.addViewdetails          codepre  pI have tried multiple things such as nested RecyclerViews but its equally slow. Is there a good solution to create multiple views for each page without getting hit by performance mostly seen when scrolling vertically and only for a second but still very annoying.p  pSo far my best solution is RecyclerView  nested RecyclerView for each page and Horizontall Scroll View which creates less layouts just 10 instead of 20 and they are simple.p  pThanksp

Negative 6610 pI have learned that you must dissolve a mn Chen relation into 1n by using an own entity. So, a typical case is a mn relation between the entities Order and Article. I dissolve it by using an entity named Orderpositions.  Am I wrong if I think that this is a typical way, applied in the praxisp  pAnyway, beginning with this simplified relationshipmodelp  pstrongOrderstrong emorderidem PK, date, totalsump  pstrongOrderpositionsstrong emorderidem PK amp FK, emorderposidem PK, emarticleidem FK, amount, sump  pstrongArticlestrong emarticleidem PK, describtion, pricep  pI need an integrity constraint for Orderpositions.sum and Order.totalsum I am using H2 Database and Java.p  pHow do I typically realise this simple integrity constraint By using a constraint clause or do I need a Trigger For a Trigger there is the problem, that I must apply an insert and updatetrigger for an INSERT or UPDATE on the same table Orderpositions f.e. Ive read that for mySQL its even impossible at all. But I mean that this is a case that very often occures.p  pI hope you can help me finding an answer to this misery.p

Negative 6610 pI am creating a Lucene index to use as input to SemanticVectors5.4. I am indexing a list containing both bigrams and trigrams of English words. I have a frequency associated with each of the bitrigrams which I want to set as the Document frequency in Lucene. Currently I am doing this in a very inefficient way, creating X identical documents for each bitrigram where X is my associated frequency. So an example entry which I am inserting into the index is  p  blockquote   p731   academic    performancep blockquote  pWhere 731 is my frequency. At the moment I just have a forloop which would create create 731 identical documents in order for the stored frequency to be correct. This seems like a very poor method to me, but I cant find a way to manually set the document frequency in Lucene. Is there a better way to index these entries with Lucene Currently SemanticVectors cannot process the resulting Lucene index, I believe, due to its size. I have much smaller Lucene indexes correctly functioning with SemanticVectors.p

Negative 6610 pI need to convert a JSON data with one structure to another which I can use to generate NvD3 charts. In the last days Ive been asking and reading to do this and I achieved a partial solution. It will work unless I add one more keyvalue to the datajson dictionary.p  pThe weirdest thing is that despite that the lines refering to datosTEU are commented, it keeps assigning values to that dictionary entry and dont know why. Even I just uncomment the first loop it will end up with the same data as the other key. So I end up with 2 copies of the same data inserted in 2 differnt keys. Apart from that I keeps repeating data or making overlaps in the loops.p  pFor sure Im making a big noob error but I cant see it.

Negative 6610 pI was doing a small project using AngularJS in my Ubuntu OS. I used Yeoman to create the project and after writing some code, I started running the project usingbr       grunt serve Everything was working fine, I got page displayed which was written using Angular.

None of the angular code is working including routes. The folder bowercomponents contains the angular header files. I found that none of them is loading.

Negative 6610 pI am trying to make the generation of voxelcubes more efficient. First of all I calculate on the cpu which faces are not hidden by other voxelscubes. Than I send the voxelcube position and the face normal to the gpu  the vertex, geometry and fragment shader. So now I want simply to generate in the geometry shader a triangle strip from the strongvoxel positionstrong and strongface normalstrong. But now I have problems to calculate the four new vertices from these two informations, I cant find a solution without if and else functions. And since I use backface culling I have to pay attention to the order I emit the vertices from the shader, too. Whats the most efficient way to solve my problem Or have someone a better idea than my approachp  pThe normal vector can only have 6 states, for each face of a cube 0, 0, 1 Front 0, 0, 1 Back 0, 1, 0 Up 0, 1, 0 Down 1, 0, 0 Right 1, 0, 0 Leftp

Negative 6610 pIm new to javascript. Im creating an Adobe Acrobat Form that uses javascript to open a custom dialog box that allows the form user to select an email destination for the filled from. Once the form is filled, the user clicks a Submit button, the custom dialog box appears and the user then selects the recipient by radio button and the form is then sent to the recipients email address once the OK button on the dialog is clicked.

He then suggests that I create a zero width whitespace char, and then select that. p  pSo how do I do that Or are there any other alternatives p  pworking code welcome  p  pEdit 1 p  pReference to cursor was corrected to caretp

One by one, they get read and sent a server to execute commands. p  pIts very important that special characters be formatted properly, however they cannot simply be written in the text file as codeu0002code, for example, as that will be interpreted as codeu0002code, and not the codeltSTXgtcode character that I am looking for. p  pWhat Ive done, therefore, is to write them in the text file under this format p  precodex02testx03 codepre  pand Ive written a regex in java to extract the numerical values, as sop  precodexww.  codepre  pNote the extra escape characters, to escape codecode and codecodep  pMy question is How can I grab the hexadecimal characters codewwcode, and then convert them to a Unicode character in a string, ideally using String.format p  pI know that Im able to physically grab the characters using code1code, as codewwcode is the first and only group in each regex pattern. However, Im having issues with the conversion. Ive tried the following p  precodeString.replaceAllxww, Character.toStringcharInteger.parseInt1 codepre  pBut Im having issues with the codeInteger.parseInt1code part, as code1code is being interpreted as the string code1code, and not the captured group for example, 02. p  pAs a quick workaround, Ive implemented a workaround for each case that I need, which works.  example codeString.replacex02, Character.toStringchar int0x0002code . However, this is obviously terrible form, and not at all effective for parsing any case. p  pIf someone could help me and point me towards documentation  an explanation as to why code1code is interpreted as code1code and not the captured group, as well as a solutionworkaround, it would be much appreciated. p  pEDIT p  pThank you to nhahtdh below.

Negative 6610 pThe idea is to redesign data structure andor change DB. I just started to review this project and plan to start optimization from this one.p  pCurrently i have CouchDb with about strong80GBstrong of document data, around strong30Mstrong records. From that subset for the most of documents properties like strongid, groupid, location, typestrong can be considered as generic, but unfortunately for now such are even stored with different property naming around the set. Also a lot of deeply nested can be found.p  pStructure isnt hardly defined, thats why NoSQL db was selected way before some picture was seen.p  pData is calculated and populated in DB in a separate Job on powerful cluster. This isnt done too often. From that perspective i can conclude that general writeupdate performance isnt very important. Also size decrease would be great, but isnt most important. There are only like 110 active customers at a time. Actually read performance with various filteringgrouping etc is most important. But no heavy summary calculations should be done, this one is already done while population. p  pThis one is a data analytical tool for displaying compare and other reports to quality engineers and data analyst, so they can browse the results, group them or filter from the Web UI. p  pNow such tasks like searching a subset of document properties for a text isnt possible due to performance.p  pFor sure ive done some initial investigationslike a hrefhttpwww.datastax.comwpcontentthemesdatastax201408filesNoSQLBenchmarksEndPoint.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.datastax.comwpcontentthemesdatastax201408filesNoSQLBenchmarksEndPoint.pdfa and it looks Cassandra seems to be good choice among NoSql.p  pAlso its quite interesting trying to port this data into the new PostgreSQl.p  pAny ideas would be highly appreciated p

Negative 6610 pSo I taught myself x86 Assembly a while back and was just playing around with inline Assembly in C. p  pSo what I want to do is in a functions parameters, pass in an array, an index  unsigned int  and a number. With assembly it will then change the value in that memory location of the array to the passed in value. So the code looks like this.p  precodeinline void Set int pArray[], unsigned int pIndex, int pNum       asm          mov ebx, pIndex         mov eax, 4         mul ebx         mov ebx, pNum          lea edi, pArray         mov [ edi  eax ], ebx        int main      int myArray[ 5 ]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5      Set myArray, 2, 7      stdcout ltlt myArray[ 2 ] ltlt stdendl  codepre  pSo the code should load the start of the array address, get the index and multiply it by 4 so the memory location is moved by that many bytes, and it changes it to the value passed in. However, when I do this, the value stays the same. Why is that What is going wrong p

Negative 6610 pBackground My development environment is setup in TFS. I have a regular DEV branch and a QA branch. I have it setup in TFS that the QA is a branch of DEV. I am also using Jenkins to perform deploys to DEV and QA servers. For the QA build, what Ive done is setup the prescmbuildstep plugin to execute a script that merges the DEV branch to QA along with any new changes using the tf merge and tf checkin commands. Then, the builtin Jenkins SCM kicks in and downloads the code from TFS. Finally, MSBuild builds the code and deploys it to the server.p  pProblem The problem I am having is that the SCM kicks in before the prescmbuildstep scripts finishes executing. That means the code that gets compiled is actually one version older than what I want. Ive tried adding a batch file in the prescmbuildstep step that sleeps for 30 seconds to no avail. The SCM code executes about 15 seconds before the commit in TFS is registered.p  pA workaround I could do is use the Build Flow plugin to create a flow, but I was really hoping to avoid doing this as it will require redoing all the different projects Ive already setup in Jenkins.p  pAny ideas on what might be happening and what I can do to fix itp  pFor example, below is the sequence of events in Jenkinsp  ol liTF Merge script executes li liSecond script starts  ul liprints echo Tue 06232015 91639.98 li liSleep 30 seconds, li liprints echo Tue 06232015 91710.09 li ulli liSCM Runs with the following command CTeamFoundationExplorerCommon7IDEtf.exe get . recursive strongversionD20150623T161625Zstrong noprompt li liTFS changeset submited at 6232015 91639 AM.li ol

Id like to use the C11 for loop, and iterate over the vectors  OR from what Ive heard, providing your own iterators is better  I just dont know how to do this when I have separate classes.

Negative 6610 pIm trying to implement a linked list and the values held by each node need not always be the same type. Ive used a void pointer to store the value, but the issue Im having is retrieving the value from the node. I want to write a single function that contains a switch statement to cast the value to the appropriate type, but Im not sure how to handle an unknown return type other than using another void pointer.p  pIs there a way around this, or perhaps a more efficient way to handle unknown data typesp

Negative 6610 pI was wondering if it was possible to access the settings defined within my karma.config.js file, and if so howp  pIm currently using a Grunt task runner to perform various tasks like building, linting, packaging, etc.  Im also using Grunt to kick off the Karma test runner to run my Jasmine unit tests.  Furthermore, Im pulling in the JasminejQuery library so I can define and read in JSON and HTML fixtures from separate files that I setup earlier.p  pWhile I was writing some new tests, I noticed that I was redefining my fixtures base path in every test file.  So I decided to pull it out and put it into a global constant.p  pThe problem Im having is where I should define it.  Currently, I have a file named testSettings.js that Im including in my karma configuration, where I define a configuration object and set it to window.testSettings.  Thats all well and good, but I think it would be better if I defined it within my karma configuration and then just referenced that from my tests.  But there doesnt look like a way to do this... or is therep  pMy library versions arep  precodekarma 0.12.32 karmajasmine 0.3.5 karmajasminejquery 0.1.1 codepre

Negative 6610 pI am trying to display a nested tree structure using html table  I am using smarttable for sortingsearching convenience and angularJS. All I am trying to do is repeatedly add  element to display all the nodes listed in the nested structure recursively. To achieve this I have written a directive and calling it recursively using angularrecursion module. But during the recursion, the element  is being added under the parent  element.

Negative 6610 pSo I moved a method into the DoWork event of a background worker so as to not kill the UI while accessing remote resources. I was fully aware as I was doing this that a bit of refactoring would be in order because the method accesses some controls on the form  not a thread friendly thing to do. To my amazement, no, it ran just fine. Odd but I didnt question it, though it still rattled around in my head. Strange.p  pThen I added another control, a ComboBox for timezone selection. I added the line to the DoWork method to access the value and BAM...Cross thread operation not valid.p  precode private void BackgroundWorker1DoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e        backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress0, new StatusInitializing..., StatusState.Initializing       Query query  new Query      query.Hostname  textBoxHostname.Text                          Valid...      query.Port  Int32.ParsetextBoxPort.Text                     Valid...      query.Point  Int32.ParsetextBoxPoint.Text                   Valid...      query.Start  dateTimePickerStart.Value                        Valid...      query.End  dateTimePickerEnd.Value                            Valid...      query.Sampling  Sampling.ParsetextBoxSampling.Text          Valid...      query.Timezone  TimeZoneInfocomboBoxTimezone.SelectedValue  Not Valid        Run query  codepre  pSo why is it that all the other calls to controls created on the other thread are just fine, but this one blows up My guess is some sort of caching on the .NET side of things so that the underlying control is never actually accessed for the others. May have to dig into some Reference Source soon if there are no replies.p  pI suppose I should I add that I have fixed the error by simply building the Query object and passing it to the codeBackgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsynccode call. Im really looking for an explanation rather than a solution.p

Negative 6610 pMy objective is to get data from a table stored in MySQL db. For that I have created a custom service task which pulls out the relevant data using hibernate. It works as expected when I run it as a java application on Eclipse. It complains that it is not able to find the required persistence unit when run on the server. p  pIm pushing my project using git onto kieworkbenchnot sure if its a good way and had to make a few modifications to couple the work item with work item handler. Work item handler gets called when the process instance reaches the service task, but is not able to find the persistence unit.p  pThere is a persistence.xml which has the required PU under my projects METAINF, but, apparently, workbench requires it somewhere else. How do I add it to the existing persistence.xml that workbench uses internally Or is there a better way to do it How else do I pull up information from DB and display it on a user task, if this is not the correct wayp  pPS  I just got started with jbpm, so dont have much knowledge of how things work.p  pThanks in advance.p  p[UPDATE] I modified the persistence.xml on the jbpmconsole.war, so now its able to find the required persistence unit. Im not sure if this is the correct way to do it.p
Negative 6610 pThe title looks complicated, but the problem is not that hard. I have 2 matrices codedataXcode and codedataYcode. I have to construct a new matrix based on codedataXcode, which will consists of all the rows of codedataXcode, where the corresponding value in the column codecolumncode in codedataYcode is not equal to codesomeNumbercode.

Negative 6610 pI have this code already. Im trying to create a grid of rectangles that auto resize when the browser screen resizes or adjusts biggersmaller. In my example, there are 9 rectangles occupying the grid. First, imagine the whole grid as a giant rectangle. I want this whole grid to fill the browser screen entirely with no padding. Then, each individual rectangle that make up the grid I want each to take up an equal amount of space inside the grid. So a rectangle in this scenario of 9X9, should take up 33.33 of the width and 33.33 of the height thats 13. Each rectangle inside the grid should also have no padding or maybe 2px padding where they come into contact with another rectangle in the grid.p  pThe issue I have so far in my code is that its not filling in 100 in the height, there is padding of the whole grid between the browser window and the whole grid, and the content inside each rectangle goes outside of the rectangle. See the IMG picture how it floats over to the other rectangles. Id appreciate any help with these things. Thanksp  pAlso, I want minimum size to be 90px wide for each rectangle, so if you shrink window where each rectangle is smaller than 90px, the whole main browser window will scroll and the individual rectangle will stop shrinking dynamically.        p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgtltstylegt     mozboxsizing borderbox   webkitboxsizing borderbox   boxsizing borderbox   .grid    background white  .gridafter     Or extend clearfix    content    display table   clear both   [classcol]    float left   paddingright 2px  .grid [classcol]lastoftype    paddingright 0   .col13    width 33.33   height 33.33   .module    padding 2px   background eee    Optin outside padding  body    background urlhttps.cdpn.io3darkwall2X.png   backgroundsize 300px 300px   h1    color white  h1 em    color 666   fontsize 16px  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv classgridgt     ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 1.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt      ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt             ltimg srchttpwww.ecdevelopment.orgwpcontentuploads201504hippieflower300x300.jpggt      ltdivgt    ltdivgt     ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 3ltpgt          ltdivgt    ltdivgt         ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 4.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt       ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 5.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt       ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 6.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt         ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 7.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt       ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 8.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt       ltdiv classcol13gt      ltdiv classmodulegt        lth3gt23lth3gt                 ltpgtbox 9.ltpgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt        ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 6610 pI am using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comJoshCloseCsvHelper relnofollowCsvHelpera package to write my C models to Csv. I am using fluent class maps inheriting from CsvClassMap to define my field to property mappings.p  pThe issue I have is that some of the property values look like dates to excel. For example 2  4. I expect the end user to use excel to view these CSVs. I do not want these values to show as dates, so I am looking to have CsvHelper surround this field by quotes. However, I want ONLY this field surrounded by quotes. There are OTHER fields containing data I WANT to be interpreted e.g. dates. Can I configure my mapping to specify this field should be quoted Ive played with using a type converter, but thats clearly the wrong approach because this is converting the VALUE and not instructing how to format the field.p

I know that ggplot is coloring based on the color wheel divided by 5, and then by 4, respectively, but I dont know how to make it always divide by 5 and use the same color consistently, even though there is no value E in factor z, in the second plot.p
