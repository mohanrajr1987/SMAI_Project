It also has a custom background which I paint in response to a WMERASEBKGND call currently a simple call to FillSolidRect.  p  pWhen the dialog is resized, there is tremendous flickering going on.  To try and reduce the flickering I enumerate all child windows and add them to the clipping region.  That seems to help a little  now the flickering is mostly evident in all of the child controls as they repaint.p  pHow can I make the dialog flickerfree while resizing  I suspect doublebuffering must play a part, but Im not sure how to do that with a dialog with child controls without making all child controls ownerdraw or something like that.p  pI should note that Im using C not .NET, and MFC, although pure Win32based solutions are welcomed p  pNOTE One thing I tried but which didnt work not sure why wasp  precodeCDC memDC memDC.CreateCompatibleDCpDC memDC.FillSolidRectrect, backgroundColor  pDCgtBitBlt0, 0, rect.Width, rect.Height, ampmemDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY codepre

Negative 18 pI have a resource scheduling issue in Java where things need to be sequenced, but there are restrictions on what resources can be next to each other.  A good analogy is a string of digits, where only certain digits can be next to each other.  My solution was recursive, and works fine for small strings, but run time is OXN, where X is the number of possible digits the base, and N is the length of the string.  It quickly becomes unmanageable.p  pUsing the compatibility matrix below, here are a few examples of allowed stringsbr Length of 1  0, 1, 2, 3, 4br Length of 2  02, 03, 14, 20, 30, 41br Length of 3  020, 030, 141, 202, 203, 302, 303, 414brp  pre      0  1  2  3  4     0  0  0  1  1  0 1  0  0  0  0  1 2  1  0  0  0  0 3  1  0  0  0  0 4  0  1  0  0  0 pre  pMy solution for counting all strings of length N was start with an empty string, permute the first digit, and make a recursive call for all strings of length N1.  The recursive calls check the last digit that was added and try all permutations that can be next to that digit.  There are some optimizations made so that I dont try and permute 00, 01, 04 every time, for example  only 02, 03, but performance is still poor as it scales from base 5 the example to base 4000.p  pAny thoughts on a better way to count the permutations other than trying to enumerate all of themp

Negative 18 pI have a problem in Java where I set up a dynamic proxy with a JMX interface, pass this on to another component which then makes calls to the proxy object.

I dont care what the rights are right now  I just want to be able to take a giverguid and get back a list of all the guids and names of anyone he has given rights to.  Im having trouble conceptualizing how to translate these tables to an object model in such a way that I can perform that query.p  pIf it helps to know, receiverguid and giverguid are both could both be manytoone mappings to userinfo.guid.  userinfo.guid is the pk on that table the pk on rightstable is another column not mentioned here.p  pstrongEdit My solutionstrongp  pAs Tim suggested, I put manytoone mappings on the rights table object that linked the rights table to the User table.  It took me a while to understand that Hibernate does joins implicity for you when you do mappings like this, so here is what I basically ended up with for HQLp  precodeString hqlQuery                 select right.recipientguid, user.name       from rightsTable right, userInfo user       where right.recipientguid  user.guid and right.giverguid like giverguid codepre  pHonestly, I dont even know if there are joins happening behind the scene there, but I know that this gives me the information I originally wanted.  If anyone has suggestions for how to do this query more efficiently please let me know.p

Negative 18 pI need some good pseudo random number generator that can be computed like a pure function from its previous output without any state hiding.

Say, we have 32bit LCG, codem  232code and it is constant, our codep  64code two 32bit parameters codeacode and codeccode, coden  p  96code, so we must peek data by three ints from output to meet second condition. Unfortunately, condition can not be meet because of strictly alternating sequence of odd and even ints in output. To overcome this, hidden state must be introduced, but that makes function not pure and breaks first condition long hidden period.p  pstrongEDITstrong Strictly speaking, I want family of functions parametrized by codepcode bits and with full state of codencode bits, each generating all possible binary strings of codep  ncode bits in unique randomish way, not just continuously incrementing codep  ncodebit int.

Negative 18 pIve found that under some circumstances the Eclipse python debugger can be unreliable. For example, when stepping through a memoryhungry Python program Ive found that after a certain point the debugger fails to respond. The entire process hangs with 100 cpu load. p  pIve heard unconfirmed reports from developers that when this occurs it might actually not be a hang but very slow, for example a step which usually takes a microsecond might be taking five minutes. p  pIve observed this with both the regular eclipse debugger e.g. when you do debug aspython run and the pydev network debugger. The point at which things stop working seems quite arbitrary but reproducable. Im debugging purely numerical functions so theres no obvious socket or tcp activity which could disrupt a network debugger. Nevertheless, the point at which the failure occurs seems to be quite consistent for a given workstation amp task. p  pI get almost exactly the same effect whether I debug using debug aspython run as I might if I use the pydevs network debugger import pydevdpydevd.settrace  where one fails the other is also likely to fail.p  pIf I were to run the script normally no debugger it executes without any hangs. Furthermore, if I replace the eclipse debugger with the oldskool inline breakpoint import pdbpdb.settrace everything works just fine. Pdb almost never goes wrong, however there are times I simply cannot use it, for example when I am debugging a python function invoked from Excel  as there is no console present.p  pIve noticed that this failure never seems to occur with trivial programs, hence Ive tentatively concluded that the fault may be memory related.p  pSo  is anybody aware of what might be causing this unreliability. Are there any tweaks  I can make to the debugger or environment that might make the debugger work more reliablyp  pFYI, running Python 2.4.4 on Windows XP 32bit with the latest Eclipse amp Pydev. Psyco JIT Compiler is not available.p

However, the System.Net namespace isnt supported in its web player. I need to do an HTTP request polling a php file and wait sleep until Ive gotten a response.

What methods exist if any for transferring data between different servers and the different editionsp  p3 Are there any common pitfalls that someone like me who is used to the other database systems that I mentioned might encountered during developmentp  pTIAp

Negative 18 pI wrote a code generator which generates POCOs and repositories for a given SQL ServerCE database. Nothing fancy, only simple CRUD procedures using classic ADO.Net. My question is, why should I use an ORM like L2SEF4 over custom code generator Every 2 or 3 years Microsoft ships some new data access frameworktechnology and I know quite a few developers who cant always be in touch with the latest technologies, but every one of them knows the classic ADO.Net, how to modify the existing code and how to develop a new functionalities. Do ORM tools bring something which is a must nowdays, or I can stick with a classic ADO.Netp  pThank youp
Negative 18 pI released my Android app two days ago, using admob advertising. I used my personal phone as the test phone,  but took out the test mode code before releasing it. My admob status is active and I get requests and impressions on the report, but whenever I try to use the app on my personal phone i only get test ads. I dont know why. I looked through the code of my app and cant find anything amiss. And i did delete the test version of the app and then download the released version from the market.p
Negative 18 pI have a table which contains a location of all geographical locations in the world and their relationships.p  pHere is a example that shows the hierarchy. You will see that the data is actually stored as all threep  ul liEnumerated Pathli liAdjacency listli liNested Setli ul  pThe data obviously never changes either.

I store some basic information but most important I store the codewoeidcode which is a foreign key from codegeoplanetplacescode. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDFLEe.jpg altenter image description herep  pEventually the codeentitiescode table will contain several thousand entities. And I would like a way to be able to return a full tree of all of the nodes which contain entities. p  pI plan on creating something to facilitate the filtering and searching of entities based on their geographical location and be able to discover how many entities can be found on that particular node. p  pSo if I only have one entity in my codeentitiescode table, I might have something like thisp  blockquote   pEarth 1  p      pUnited Kingdom 1p      pEngland 1p      pEast Sussex 1p      pBrighton and Hove City 1p      pBrighton 1p blockquote  pLets then say that I have another entity which is located in Devon, then it would show something likep  blockquote   pEarth 2p      pUnited Kingom 2p      pEngland 2p      pDevon 1p      pEast Sussex 1   ... etcp blockquote  pThe Counts which will say how many entities are inside of each geographical location do not need to be live. I can live with generating my object every hour and caching it. p  pThe aim, is to be able to create an interface which might start out showing only the Countries which have entities..p  pSo like p  pcodeArgentina 1021code, codeChile 291code, code...code, codeUnited States 32,103code, codeUnited Kingdom 12,338codep  pThen the user will click on a location, such as United Kindom, and will then be given all of the immediate child nodes which are descendants of United Kingdom AND have an entity in them.p  pIf there are 32 Counties in United Kindgdom, but only 23 of them eventually when you drill down have entities stored in them, then I dont want to display the other 9. It is only locations.p  pThis site aptly demonstrates the functionality that I wish to achieve a hrefhttpwww.homeaway.comvacationrentalseuroper5httpwww.homeaway.comvacationrentalseuroper5a img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvsvza.jpg altenter image description herep  pHow do you recommend that I manage such a data structure p  pThings I am using.p  ul liPHPli liMySQLli liSolrli ul  pI plan on having the Drill downs be as rapid as possible.

If it requires the password, it should do a validation check and cause the validations to fail.p  pIm starting to hate Devise  or just the idea of using gems to build parts of your application in a blackbox. I think the real solution probably is to rip out Devise and just do it all from scratch. That way your app has total control of how all of this works p

Negative 18 pIve been developing in PHP for a while now but only recently made the switch over to an OOP approach. p  pOne question that keeps cropping up for me is how far to go with the OOP stuff, specifically in terms of execution speed and memory resources etc.p  pFor example, lets say I have 2 objects, User and Listingp  pListings are always linked to a individual user. UserId is a property of Listing so I know which user it relates to. Once in a while, within a Listing method I need to access a single property of the related User.p  pAs far as I can see please advise if not I have 3 options for how to accomplish this.p  ol lipCreate a new user object and access the relevent propery via user  thePropertypli lipMake the required property a local property of Listing and populate this when Listing is initialised e.g. via a sql joinpli lipQuery the database directly to retrieve the property of User required via the user IDpli ol  pIt seems to me that options 1 amp 2 obide by OOP rules more stringently, but have performance hits due to initialising a whole object simply to retrieve 1 property. Option 3 would be the least memory intensive but sidesteps OOP altogether.p  pIn addition, in terms of populating objects at creation, most of my objects get most of their properties populated via one fill method shortly after being initialised hence requiring only 1 DB query. Would this generally be considered best practise, or would it be more advisable to use individual methods to get these properties, populating as and when they are neededp  pI realise there may not be correct answers to this, but could anyone give an advice on best ways to approach this situationp  pMany thanks Nickp

Negative 18 pMy situation is perhaps one of the most masochistic in which Ive ever been.p  pI have a series of images that fade in and fade out over a period of time using jQuery. Theyre all transparent PNGs. Because Im interested in optimizing the speed of my website, I thought it would be convenient if I could throw all of my PNGs in one nice spriteable PNG file, still retaining the good benefits of transparency along the way.p  pOf course, IE is the browser that presents a problem IE8 seems to struggle with rendering PNGs that fade in and out without the use of AlphaImageLoader. The problem with AlphaImageLoader, however, is that it ignores CSS properties like backgroundposition, rendering CSS sprites impossible to render.p  pAny ideas of fantastical brilliance out there p  pIve considered using the clip CSS property, but no sprite generator out there today currently outputs data using clip, and coding it in manually would be a real PITA.p

Negative 18 pIm uploading multiple files via XmlHTTPRequest and HTML5.  I have the uploading working fine, but I would like to have a progress bar for each file upload going on.  The code I have, however, uses the last progress bar for ALL of the file uploads instead of each upload using its own progress bar.

A user will most likely use the API in an AJAX call on their server.  p  pSo for example, my domain that is serving up the API PHP file is called dev.yourmapper.com.  Someone on the domain www.metromapper.org builds a page that creates a Google map, and calls my file using Ajax to overlay my data on their map.   p  pHere is that example in action a hrefhttpwww.metromapper.orgexampleapitest.htm relnofollowhttpwww.metromapper.orgexampleapitest.htmap  pClick the center map marker to see a popup of all the PHP Server variables available to the yourmapper.com script.p  pNote that HTTPREFERER is likely going to be stackoverflow.com if you click the link or empty if you cut and paste the link.  I would think that the referer would be metromapper.org, since that domain calls the yourmapper.com script after it loads, but apparently not.  p  pBottom line what method can I use to determine which domain is calling my yourmapper.com script with Javascript  I can use other languages besides PHP if needed.

Negative 18 pThis is in Sinatra.  In my get, I create an instance variable which is a nokogiri object, created from an external xml file.

In my post method, I need access to that same nokogiri object I may return to post numerous times and may modify the nokogiri object.

I need to refresh the table contents every 15 seconds without refreshing the page obviously.

For example artifact residing in directory Haroogan.More.Whatever has name Haroogan.More.Whatever.p  pThis has several consequencesp  ul lilibrary, executable, etc. produced after a build will be named with ArtifactNameli liall source code pertaining to a particular artifact is enclosed in a namespace corresponding to the ArtifactName. For instance artifact Haroogan.More.Whatever imposes HarooganMoreWhatever namespace on all its sourcesli liwhen one artifact wants to use another one, then one has to include another ones headers and optionally link against it. However, we all know writing codeinclude ..Haroogan.Moremore.hcode not only looks messy, but also breaks the basic idea that artifacts actually represent standalone components which have to be decoupled even in terms of filesystem. Moreover, the concept of private headers is also broken, because this way I can access any headers inside other artifacts.li ul  pWhat we need here is simply a strongpublic header repositorystrong  the include directory. Therefore, to address the last issue  I decided to do the followingp  ul lieach artifact decides in its CMakeLists.txt of course on its own which headers it wants to export to the outside worldli lithen it copies on every build, but only when needed of course these header files to the corresponding directory inside include. For instance, if ArtifactName is Haroogan.More.Whatever then headers will be copied to includeHarooganMoreWhatever directory as shown above.li ul  pI believe its a nice and robust approach since now if I want to use whatever and more classes from Haroogan.More.Whatever and Haroogan.More artifacts in other components  I simply writep  precodeinclude ltHarooganMoreWhateverwhatever.hgt include ltHarooganMoremore.hgt  using HarooganMoreWhateverwhatever using HarooganMoremore codepre  pThe system works like a charm I can provide CMake scripts if anybody wants.

Negative 18 pWe are developing a Video on demand system where users can upload videos. We want to create a tree structure of the archive of videos where the user can create folders of artistsalbums etc and store the videos under the correct folders. Like all tree structures, the user will be able to move videos between folders, delete sub trees, copy videos and move sub trees and children.p  pThe tree could have 10s of 1000s of videos and folders.p  pMy question is would an ORM be suitable for a tree like structure of this sizep
Negative 18 pI am working on a Django project where I have to use South to migrate one application to another. I have the old internal message application which I have to replace by another completely different. I was wondering if I could pass by orm, but the old application doesnt exist anymore in the INSTALLEDAPPS, so no sense. Does using a SQL procedure is the way to do that Id like to keep the application DB type independant at the time.p

Negative 18 pI have implemented some computationaly heavy functions into my application. Depending on the type of input it can take up to several minutes for a thread to return. During this time, I want the user to be able to work with other activities to perform different tasks i.e. prepare data for the next run. Then, after the Service has finished its computations, the user should be notified with a Toast that the result is ready and that he should check back to the Activity he started the Service in. Unfortunately Im stuck at this point. p  pIs it possible to somehow communicate with an Activity which is destroyed at the moment Like modifying the saved state, so that when it gets recreated the result will be displayed. The only way of communication I did find was via broadcasting from the Service, but this requires the Activity to listen, which is not possible as it doesnt exist at the moment the Service finishes.p  pThe only solution that occured to me was writing a file when the Service is finished and then trying to read it in the Activity, but I would prefer not to work with the file system if thats possible.p  pAm I missing something here or thinking in the wrong directionp

Negative 18 pOn Linux, for a CC program using pthreads, is there a way to see how threads were scheduled for the life of a process  Id like to see which CPUs on which every thread runs.  Id like to see when threads were preempted and why.p  pWe have set up a test environment where two identical machines run identical processes.  There is a third machine generating clock events to which the two machines listen sent via multicast.  The machines processes do some stuff at each clock, then send a result to the third machine.  The idea is that the third machine eliminates the clock synchronization problem between the two identical machines.  Our expectation is that the results coming back should be at exactly or almost exactly the same time.  And generally they are.  The problem is, we see occasional spikes, where one result is dramatically delayed by an order of 10x the standard deviation of all results.p  pWe are looking at microsecond level optimization.  In this arena, cache misses and thread wakeup times become an issue.  It is known that the total number of threads across all processes is greater than the number of CPU cores.p  pI suspect that these spikes are caused by the occasional perfect storm of thread preemption, threadCPU migration and therefore cache miss.  Within the various processes, there are actually only two or three important threads doing timesensitive work.  The rest are ancillarysupport threads, of lower priority.  In total, the number of importanttimesensitive threads is actually equal to or less than the number of cores.p  pI suspect that the solution to this is to carefully assign important threads to their own cores, and dump all the support threads onto their own core.  But this would require a fair amount of development effort, and Id like to confirm my suspicions before heading down this road.p

Negative 18 pI have a loop which needs to create an unspecified and indefinite amount of Background threads.  The threads will then simply run to completion but some may need to be cancelled.  p  pI originally planned to do this by declaring one backgroundWorker, adding it to a list, then newing the BackgroundWorker to begin the process again.  However because the List.Add method runs by reference to the passed in object I am thinking that when I new the original BackgroundWorker, the thread referenced by the List will be lost or worse.p  pMy second thought was simply assigning my newed value to a element in an array array[i]  new BackgroundWorker but this does not lend itself to an indefinite amount of threads.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions of a good way to manage these individual threads Thanks in advance.p

Negative 18 pI have implemented 404 handling for the general case in ASP.NET MVC 3, for when a controllerview is not found.

Negative 18 pIm working on a function that determines if the content of a given html element  el  in an lxml ElementTree is the leading content of a line in a rendered HTML page. To do this, Im trying to find the rightmost block level element that is left of el, and then determine if there is content between these two. p  pI figure this can happen via a traversal in the reverse order of a DFS, with the reverse traversal starting at el. But Ive also been trying to find if a simpler method exists using lxml or xpath to do this. So far Ive found ways to find elements that are ancestors or left siblings of a given element with some criteria, but I havent spotted anything that works on the entire tree right or left of a specific node. p  pDoes anybody know of a simpler way to do this search using lxml or xpath p  pstrongExamplestrongp  precodelthtmlgt ltbody classfirstgt root lt A span that does not have its own content, but does have several levels of childrengt ltspangt   ltagt     ltbgt       lth1 classfirstgt         A block level that is the decendant of several non block levels       lth1gt     ltbgt   ltagt   ltspan classfirst idtrickygt     A nonblock level that has no block levels among its ancestors, but a block level element among its left cousins   ltspangt   ltspangt     A nonblock level that has no block levels among its ancestors, and content between itself and its nearest leftcousin block level   ltspangt ltspangt ltdiv classfirstgt a block level ltdivgt ltdivgt ltspan classfirstgtfirst content in a non block level in a block levelltspangt ltspangtfollowing content in a non block level in a block levelltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt   ltigt  ltigtltbclassfirstgta non block level that contains the first content within a block level, but follows an empty nonblock levelltbgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pIn the above Ive added a first class to any element that, when rendered, would appear to present the leading content of a line.

Negative 18 pI have been reading through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions703453optionalfunctionparametersusedefaultargumentsnulloroverloadthefunctthis similar questiona and find myself less than satisfied with the responses. I dont have a simple function called foo I have a much more complex function which has very real dangers if parameters are not supplied judiciously. It seems preferable to me for the function to enforce its own rules and ensure system robustness than to lean towards semantic niceties which insist on one function, one thing to do. I think the favoured responses given to that question reflect programming idealism taken too far, not the reality of certain situations.p  pWhat I face isp  precodevoid DoSomethingVeryComplex const CRect bounds, CPoint startPoint  CPoint1,1  codepre  pNow this happens to satisfy the semantic rules  it is doing some thing, not several things. The one thing it is doing happens to be complex, and multistaged, but it is still one thing.p  pFor that complex thing, it is recommended that the user supply the bounds, and let the function determine its own starting point. Advanced users might want to do the considerable math to determine a specific alternative starting point and supply that... but users beware.p  pAnd now I have come to see that on rare occasions, it makes sense to supply not one, but several starting points. This changes nothing in the semantic concept of the process involved, because the process is one which spreads from one point to neighbours, to neighbours of neighbours, and so on. So starting from many points is a natural extension.p  pAccordingly, I would prefer to specifyp  precodevoid DoSomethingVeryComplex const CRect bounds,                              const stdvectorltCPointgt startPoint   empty   codepre  pso that if the vector is empty, the function determines the start point as before, and if there are any points in the vector, they are used as start points.p  pIs there a C syntax available which allows me to do this  to specify an empty array as a default parameterp

Negative 18 pA few weeks ago, I post a question about queuing database access request to prevent too many connection error when massive concurrent db requests happen. People told me ConnectionPool is the right way to go which I agreed at that time. However, I finally realized this is not the solution especially when there are a lot of different clients accessing mysql server through network, because connection pool is at client side it can not prevent the sum of connections of all clients from exceeding the max connection number of mysql server.p  pI think there should be some middleware on the mysql server working as a queue or pool, is anybody familiar with this Thank you.p  pI know this question is widely asked, I am also surprised as if there is no total solution for it.  p

Negative 18 pI am trying to flash the icon to the user using a GlassPane. I am running a codejavax.swing.Timercode which basically performs thisp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 3 i      frame.getGlassPane.setVisibletrue     try          Thread.sleep500      catch InterruptedException e1         To change body of catch statement use File  Settings  File Templates.         e1.printStackTrace          frame.getGlassPane.setVisiblefalse  codepre  pUnfortunatly, if I sleep the EDT current thread within the timer, the icon does not show, as in the codepaintComponentcode method did not manage to get invoked fully before the thread went to sleep. Therefore, when the next instruction kicks in, the glass pane is hidden, and, as a result, the icon is never shown. Is there a way to achieve what I want using this similiar approachp

Negative 18 pI am using phpseclib to ssh to my server and run a python script. The python script is an infinite loop, so it runs until you stop it. When I execute python script.py via ssh with phpseclib, it works, but the page just loads for ever. It does this because phpseclib does not think it is done running the line of code that runs the infinite loop script so it hangs on that line. I have tried using exit and die after that line, but of course, it didnt work because it hangs on the line before, the one that executes the command. Does any one have any ideas on how I can fix this without modifying the python file Thanks.p

Views size is 1280x696, because of android tablet status bar at bottom with soft keys, time etc.., screen resolution is 1280x800, but codeOnTouchListenercode is receiving touch events with coords [646.0,739.0], and thus my gluunproject method fails to return correct values is there any way to return events that respect these boundaries or how should I recalculate the positionp

Negative 18 pIm redesigning a database and Im really uncomfortable with one of the approaches being used today that I want to replace.p  pA very high volume of data is loaded from .csv files which do not have a defined format at different times. The volume is related to different customersp  pSo the approach is to create a table for each new customer and keep it being loaded constantly. Problem is that there are constantly new tables being created for each customer and they do not match and are difficult to manage and query. p  pIve already thought about creating a table which would contain all the data and some columns to control from which customertable they were, but Im still thinking that might create a too big table thats even harder to manage or slow because of size.p  pAre there any other approches that I might be missing regarding load of files with a nonregular format By nonregular, I mean that each file can have different columns quantity and format.p
Negative 18 pAs a simple example, suppose I have a list of numbers codeLcode and I want to find the first element that is greater than some specific number codeXcode.

[3,4,5,6] mynode127.0.0.127gt First. 3 codepre  pBut this seems potentially very inefficient, since the list could be very long and the first match could be early on.  So Im wondering whether either a Is there an efficient way to do this that wont evaluate the rest of the elements in the list after the first match is found or b When this gets compiled, does Erlang optimize the rest of the comparisons away anyways  p  pThis is how I would achieve what Im looking for in Cp  precodeint firstmatchint list, int lengthoflist, float x     unsigned int i     fori  0 i lt lengthoflist, i         ifx gt list[i] return list[i]   immediate return           return 0.0  default value   codepre

dynamically with pictures,and an image button for adding new pictures.p  pNow,my problem is that every time i open the activity,after the pictures are loaded in the horizontal scroll view, the last row from my first table layout is disappearingis not disappearing completely  but its width is getting very small and it only fits one letter per row. I think that after the pictures are loaded the entire layout is redrawing itself and the first table doesnt maintain his propertiesthe weight property also doest apply anymore after the pictures are loaded.I could really use some help.  Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thx.p

Negative 18 h1Backgroundh1  pI have a ViewPager that will display up to 4 Fragments.  The number available at any given time is dynamic it could be 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It makes most sense to have these fragments manage themselves.  By that I mean they are singletons.  Rather than creating a new fragment with the new keyword, Ive written a getInstanceString key method which attempts to retrieve the fragment for the specified key from the map, or if it does not exist in the map, creates a new instance, places the fragment in the map with the given key, sets the fragments arguments with a bundle containing that key so the fragment can retrieve it onCreate, and then returns a new instance of that fragment.p  pFor those who arent following, heres the codep  precodepublic class DishListFragment extends ListFragment       public static final String MENU  menu      ...      private static MapltString, DishListFragmentgt mInstances  new HashMapltString, DishListFragmentgt              public static DishListFragment getInstanceString menuKey          if mInstances.containsKeymenuKey             return mInstances.getmenuKey          Bundle b  new Bundle         b.putStringMENU, menuKey         DishListFragment dlf  new DishListFragment         dlf.setArgumentsb         mInstances.putmenuKey, dlf         return dlf        codepre  pemYou may have noticed this is not thread safe.em  p  hr  h1Walkthroughh1  pOnCreate, my main activity sets its view then spawns an AsyncTask responsible for obtaining data from a server which will populate my DishListFragments.  Meanwhile, the main activity continues on and sets the PagerAdapter.  When the PagerAdapter requests a new DishListFragment, the number is converted into a key dynamically and the value from the DishListFragment.getInstancekey method is returned.  Initially the content class that is observed by the ListFragments has dummy data so one page always shows up and so there is always one page available for the ViewPager to show.p  pWhen the AsyncTask starts, a progress dialog is shown.  When it completes, it dismisses the progress dialog and calls a method in my activity which then sets the data in my content class.  Then a method, refresh, is called which tells all the DishListFragments in existence to notify their adapters that the dataset has changed.  After that method completes, the ViewPagerAdapter is notified that its dataset has changed.p  pIn my main Activityp  precodepublic void onRetrieveDataResult result      switchresult.getCode      case Result.SUCCESS     Log.iUITHREAD, Menu successfully loaded          On SUCCESS the MenuContent class should be given the data and            the adapters notified.          mRequestedDate  mPendingDate         MenuContent.setMenuDataresult.getValue         DishListFragment.refresh         mMenuPagerAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged      ...        codepre  pAnd the refresh method in the DishListFragment classp  precodepublic static void refresh      for String key  mInstances.keySet          mInstances.getkey.mListAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged         Log.dglic, DishListFragment   key   refreshed          Log.dglic, DishListFragments refreshed  codepre  hr  h1Problemh1  pThe problem is, on a cold start, everything but the frist page is updated.  Further, from my Logcat output, I gather there is only one DishListFragment in my mapp  precode1018 221141.624 I16802 Menu successfully loaded 1018 221141.744 Dglic16802 DishListFragment breakfast refreshed  1018 221141.744 Dglic16802 DishListFragments refreshed 1018 221141.744 DGLIC16802 lunch codepre  pHowever, my view pager shows 4 pages with the first still containing dummy data.  If I rotate the screen, the first page is updated and displays the correct information.  Also, if I select an item in the dummy list, a details fragment is displayed with real from the server information for the position of the item I selected  even though I only selected a dummy item. p  pMy first thought is I might have two instances of my singleton fragments.  One with a map containing a fragment with the initial dummy data and one containing the real data returned from the server.  I guess this is possible since my singleton is not thread safe.  However, I dont think this should cause any problems.  My DishListFragments do not contain the data they display, they only observe it so regardless of how many instances I might have of the emsameem DishListFragment same being for the same page, they should all observe the same data and should not show different data  the dummy data is cleared when the new data from the server is parsed and added.p  pBut, two instances of my mInstances map may explain why the view is not updating.  Perhaps the Adapters in only one of the sets of DishListFragments are being notified that their dataset has changed.  According to my Logcat though, embreakfastem, which is my first page and the one that is filled with dummy data, is indeed being notified that its dataset has changed.  Interestingly, the others are not.p  hr  h1Question..h1  pSo, as for my original question  Am I implementing a singleton grouping of Fragments correctly  If so, what other factors might be causing the weird behavior Im experiencing.  Thanks in advance p
Negative 18 pI do have a private RSAKey in XML format that was generated by a .NET class. Those keys, are regularly used to sign parts of a URL. I am trying to sign these URLs with the existing keys via Python, because I am working now in a Linux based environment. The structure of the RSAKey looks like so p  precodeRSAKeyValue,Modulus,Exponent,P,Q,DP,InverseQ,D represented in XML format. codepre  pUsing C, I simply instantiate a RSACryptoServiceProvider object and call SignDatabytes, new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider, and I am done.

I also changed the byte order.

Negative 18 pI want to see what model each of my models are base on and possibly change it.  I havent been able to find anywhere to do this in Xcode.  It seems that once you create a new model version, and select the model its based on using Editor  Add Model Version... and selecting a previous model with the Based on model drop down, theres no way to see your selection or change it.p  pThe .xcdatamodeld and .xcdatamodel files are packages and you can examine them by rightclicking  Show Package Contents.

If you need to clean up your model hierarchy you have to effectively start over and recreate each needed version at least you can copy entities from your old models so youre not entirely starting from scratch.p

Negative 18 pIn my app, I need change some views size dynamically according to its text content. At first I use codesizeWithFontcode to do the string measurement. Theres lots of measurement in my app to do, so I put the codesizeWithFontcode into a background, since apples documentation saying In iOS 10.4 and later, you may use the methods described in this class extension from secondary threads in your app and not just from the main thread. . However, the truth is that this method will call some WebCore function which is not threadsafe, so the app will crash. This bug is already been filed but still not fixed. some questions about this e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3527877sizewithfontinmultithreadcrashsizeWithFont in MultiThread Crashap  pSince I cant put the measurement into main thread due to performance, Im trying the CoreText framework. I first create a corresponding codeNSAttributedStringcode for my string, then use some CT function to do the measurement. I know that in iOS 6, therere very simple API like the codesizecode can do this job, but I cant use them due to the compatibility. So I have to call some lowlevel function like the codeCTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraintscode or codeCTFramesetterCreateFramecode, but I found that these strongCT methods sometimes didnt respect my constraintstrong. strongFor example, if I set a codeCGSize200, CGFLOATMAXcode for the codeCTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraintscode, which should means theres a constraint in the width, but acturally it will return some size that have a larger width like 205.strong The same thing happens with the codeCTFramesetterCreateFramecode. If I call it and then call the codeCTFrameGetLinescode, I sometimes get a line count less than it should be because some lines width is beyond 200px and containing more words than it should be.p  pSorry for long description, heres my questionsp  ol limaybe use the CT framework to measure a simple string is a waste, so is there a way to make sizeWithFont can be used in a background safelyli liif the behavior of codeCTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraintscode is by design, is there any way to make the CT function strictly obey my constraint If not, how can I measure the strings with a fixed width and the linebreakmode is wordwrappingli ol

Negative 18 pSQLite has the interesting feature of letting you store anything in any field regardless of its data type.p  pa hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgdifferent.htmltyping relnofollowhttpwww.sqlite.orgdifferent.htmltypingap  pIm having to read some externally created SQLite files that were created by abusing this feature. They have a field defined as VARCHAR30 but are using it to store strings up to 100 characters or more. SQLite happily does this without any trimming taking place if you make direct calls to the SQLite DLL to store your data.p  pIm currently using DevArt UniDAC 3.70.0.19 which has SQLite support to read these files, however it quite reasonably respects the size of the field as it is defined and so creates a TStringField object with a length of 30 characters. All characters stored beyond this 30 character limit are inaccessible to me.p  pIm aware of all the available Delphi solutions for SQLite however can someone tell me which of them if any can handle this featurep

ResourceHandler.          This handler bridges between Spring MVC and JSF managed resources. The handler takes     care of the case when a JSF facelet is used as a view by a Spring MVC Controller and the     view uses components like houtputScript and houtputStylesheet by correctly pointing the      resource URLs generated to the JSF resource handler.          The reason this custom handler wrapper is needed is because the JSF internal logic assumes     that the request URL for the current pageview is a JSF url. If it is a Spring MVC request, JSF     will create URLs that incorrectly includes the Spring controller context.          This handler will strip out the Spring context for the URL and add the .jsf suffix, so the     resource request will be routed to the FacesServlet with a correct resource context assuming the     faces servlet is mapped to the .jsf pattern.                 public class CustomResourceHandler extends ResourceHandlerWrapper         private ResourceHandler wrapped        public

Negative 18 pI have a SOAP XML that at the start has a custom header that I wrote. I have TCPIP Connection, and I receive Header  SOAP XML. The header has at the end rnrn. When I try to read the socket, I use bufferInputstream and it has readnextline, and that removes that rnrn that I use which means that I reached the end of the header, and hence I can not decode the header correctly. Is there a function that can ignore the carriage return and new lines, and stores the socket response in a string p

Negative 18 pI want to design an infopath form in which there is a repeating table. This table gets data loaded into it on form load using a web service to receive data. the thing is that user must be able to modify this data and send it back to the server on form submit using another web service to submit data.p  pNow I need something like multiple bindings so that the control is bound to to the web service data source to receive data, and also to the form data source in order for the other web service submit to send the form data to the server.p  pI tried to do this with a single value control not repeating value and I managed to do that by binding the control to a form data source field and setting the default value of the field to my web service receive field. But I can not do that for a repeating table because each time the form loads, I get a table with one row no matter how many rows the web service returns, filled with the data of the first row returned by the web service, and clicking add row button would result in another row with the same data of the first row.p  pplease help me. thanks.p

Negative 18 pWe are moving our multidatabase web application from LS to a Java beans architecture, but are struggling to decide how best to handle database connections and what scope should we use for them.p  pIf we use sessionScope then connection to 56 databases per call will be created for each user.

Negative 18 pMotionEvent.getRawX.getRawY return absolute coordinates i.e. based on the entire screen. But the View receiving that MotionEvent may be probably is a child of yet another View, which itself may be at some offset on the screen, etc.p  pIn particular, Im experimenting with a basic app right now and the Android menutool bar with the clock, etc. is visible at the top of the screen. When I call .getRawX.getRawY, I get accurate XY coordinates for the display as a whole  but how do I determine how those relate to the Views position on the screen if there can be menus, or if the grandparent views are themselves smaller than the screen and offset from its edgesp  pRight now, if I use the return values from .getRawX.getRawY to reposition the View, they work but the View jumps down by the height of the menus at the top of the screen because the absolute Y value is essentially increased by the vertical offset of the parent View due to the menus above it. Thus there needs to be a general case approach for determining where the parent Views are in the absolute coordinates of the screen, so that the raw XY values can be adjusted before being used to reposition the View in question.p  pIm not bothering to post code because its basically a duplicate of every other example of move a View by touch on this and many other websites. I dont have a bug Im trying to find... Im looking for the way to relate MotionEvents absolute coordinates with the relative coordinates of any app that isnt running 100 full screen.p

Negative 18 pIm writing a desktop app using Gnome technologies, and I reached the stage I started planning Semantic Desktop support.p  pAfter a lot of brainstorming, sketching ideas and models, writing notes and reading a lot about RDF and related topics, I finally came up with a plan draft.p  pThe first thing I decided to do is to define the way I give URIs to resources, and this is where Id like to hear your advice.p  pMy program consists of two partsp  p1 On the lower level, an RDF schema is defined. Its a standard set of classes and properties, possible extended by users who want more options using a definition language translated to RDF.p  p2 On the high level, the user defines resources using those classes and properties.p  pTheres no problem with the lower level, because the data model is public Even if a user decides to add new content, shes very welcome to share it and make other peoples apps have more features. The problem is with the second part. In the higher level, the user defines tasks, meetings, appointments, plans and schedules. These may be private, and the user may prefer to to have any info in the URI revealing the source of the information.p  pSo here are the questions I have on my mindp  p1 Which URI scheme should I use I dont have a website or any web pages, so using http doesnt make sense. It also doesnt seem to make sense to use any other standard IANAregistered URI. Ive been considering two options Use some custom, my own, URI scheme name for public resources, and use a bare URN for private ones, something like thisp  precodeurn  randomnameimadeup  someprivateresourceuuid codepre  pBut I was wondering whether a custom URI scheme is a good decision, Im open to hear ideas from you p  p2 How to hide the private resources On one hand, it may be very useful for the URI to tell where a task came from, especially when tasks are shared and delegated between people. On the other hand, it doesnt consider privacy. Then I was thinking, can Ishould I use two different URI styles depending on user settings This would create some inconsistency. Im not sure what to do here, since I dont have any experience with URIs. Hopefully you have some advice for me.p

I dont know what data I will receive from it and I dont know how long it will take. That cant be fixed and is something I have to work with. My best option, currently, is to wait a set amount of time and check the data Ive received for an end token . Ive tried wiring up a timer even in the class like sop  precodeTimer StopWatch  new TimerfailOut  1000 StopWatch.Elapsed  new ElapsedEventHandlerOnTimedEvent StopWatch.Interval  failOut StopWatch.Enabled  true codepre  pBut it doesnt appear to work. The event itself looks like sop  precodeprivate void OnTimedEventobject source, ElapsedEventArgs e      isReceiving  false  codepre  pMy objective is to cut the loop isReceiving is tied top  precodewhile isReceiving  true      Do Something  codepre  pBut it doesnt appear to work. I assume Ive completely misunderstood the function of the timer but Ive had suggestions before to implement it. What am I doing wrong If Im just completely misusing it, what can I use instead of a timer As Ive said, Ive no choice but to wait a set amount of time and check what Ive received. That cant be avoided or handled in any way other than waiting and hoping I get something.p  pEDITp  pMaybe its best I clarify this. The OnTimedEvent event is firing and the variable is set to false but it doesnt cut the loop as codeisReceivingcode isnt getting set to false.p  pEDIT 2p  pMr. Passants answer works beautifully barring a strange error Im encountering.

Negative 18 pI have three classes that interact as follows. codeClass Acode contains a private member of type codeClass Bcode.

Is it possible to do this, while still passing B to C under codeInterface1code p  pThe only way I can think of is to typecast codeClassBInterface2code to codeClassBcode and back to codeClassBInterface1code in the Bar method in codeClassAcode. p  pIs this the best way to do it Or should I just leave it as it isp  pThanks a lot for any help.p

Negative 18 pI was playing around with my own crude implementation for SVMs using cvxopt for solving the Quadratic programming problem inherent.I am a newbie to SVMs.p  pBecause it is my own implementation the onus of figuring out the margin support vectors and the threshold b of the separating plane is on me. On a fair sized approx 5K samples, 2 dimensional numeric input data set, in a soft SVM formulation, I ran into the problem while trying to figure out the margin support vectors. p  pThe margin support vectors are the nonzero alphas that are smaller than C. However if I blindly use cvxopts feastol parameter to determine what alphas can be deemed C and what can be deemed smaller than C, I found that the threshold values b derived from each margin support vector differ considerably, sometimes strikingly. Theoretically the thresholds b derived from any of the margin support vectors are supposed to be the same p  pSometimes adhoc thresholding works but sometimes it doesnt seem to be feasible  Maybe there is a way of cleverly trying out different threshold values to get some least inconsistent set of bs or some such.p  pa Is such a situation encountered in practice by real practitioners or inside implementations such as libsvm or svmlight etc or does this sound like bugs or implementation issues in my specific casep  pb If this is indeed a problem in practice how is it resolved The SVM tutorial by Burges states that you just take an average of all the thresholds derived from the margin support vectors  This is also whats done in the matlab code in Gunns tech report a hrefhttpwww.ecs.soton.ac.uksrgpublicationspdfSVM.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.ecs.soton.ac.uksrgpublicationspdfSVM.pdfa . Is that the simple way out and works well in practice, and is this whats done in libsvm or svmlight etc Or is there some principled way to try out different threshold values to get the least inconsistent acceptable set of thresholds b p

Negative 18 pI asked a question earlier, but I wasnt really able to explain myself clearly.p  pI made a graphic to hopefully help explain what Im trying to do.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.como8w4s.png altenter image description herep  pI have two separate tables inside the same database. One table called Consumers with about strong200 fieldsstrong including one called METERNUMBERS. And then one other table called CustomerInfo with about 30 fields including one called Meter. These two meter fields are what the join or whatever method would be based on. The problem is that not all the meter numbers in the two tables match and some are NULL values and some are a value of 0 in both tables.p  pI want to join the information for the records that have matching meter numbers between the two tables, but also keep the NULL and 0 values as their own records. There are NULL and 0 values in both tables but I dont want them to join together.p  pThere are also a few duplicate field names, like Location shown in the graphic. If its easier to fix these duplicate field names manually I can do that, but itd be cool to be able to do it programmatically.p  pstrongThe key is that I need the result in a NEW tablestrongp  pThis process will be a one time thing, not something I would do often.p  pHopefully, I explained this clearly and if anyone can help me out thatd be awesomep  pIf any more information is needed, please let me know.p  pThanks.p

Negative 18 pI am using observer design pattern and updating the GUI from model which is working great. For each operation or function call from GUI, the model sends a series of updates at various stages to notify the GUI accordingly to do updates. This resulted in rather big ifelse block in UpdateView method. Is this how it should be or can this improved by applying another design pattern I have split message from each function to a different handler which helps quite a bit.

Negative 18 pOK, I was on a little earlier having an issue with a jQuery function about slide toggles. Got that running by itself on a page with nothing interrupting it. Then I added this codep  precodefunction   toggle4.clickfunction       .toggle.hide1000     .toggle.texttoggle 4 clicked     .toggle.slideToggle1000      return false     function    toggle3.clickfunction       .toggle.hide1000     .toggle.texttoggle 3 clicked     .toggle.slideToggle1000      return false   codepre  pto my script.js file where my javascript is and the code wont run. There appears to be something in that code that is not allowing the toggle to run. When I run it on the page in HTML, I click it and all it does is return me to the top of the page instead of working correctly. My script.js file is here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9e4uM1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net9e4uM1a . p  pWhen I read the console, the error in the subject is what is present. If I take out the script.js file and just post the code on the HTML page, it works. But once I add it back it doesnt. I need the script.js file because of other scripts running on the page. Not sure how to fix this.p
Negative 18 pI have a C solution which contains three services and a number of projects. I added a class for a hrefhttplogging.apache.orglog4net relnofollowLog4neta which calls configuration details from an SQL table. I am using the same class for logging in my entire project.p  pThe logging is working fine when I debug through the code, but when I deploy it in a server and while it works using the service, the logging is not working properly. I have three services and logging depends on which service I start first. If I start service 1 first, it logs only details from that services classes, and it doesnt log other classes. p  pI tried to add codeIdisposablecode in the logger class and to destroy it each time, but I am not getting the expected results.p

Negative 18 pOk, so I am creating a sort of online shopping service and I have a DB that requires a field to match up against multiple other fields. They need to be stored, so that they can be ignored and set as maybe for later viewing. I know that setting up a comma delimited field is usually unwise, but I cannot figure out a better way to keep track of the matches while being able to categorize them into separate columns later on.p  pstrongFor eg, I have 25 products to sell and have 10 cities in which I want to sell them. Some can be shipped to 5 cites and some can be shipped to 9 cities. Now if someone searches for products in one particular city, how will only those products appear as a search result that are available for sale in that city onlystrongp  pDoes anyone have any better way of doing this without the comma delimited fieldp

Negative 18 pHttp 1.1 uses persistent connections as it has advantage of sending multiple http request using same connection.

Failure to do so may cause your application to run out of connections.p  pWhy should I close the stream or connection after receiving response, if same connection is used for multiple httprequest I am triggering multiple httprequests for same internet resource so why should I close connectionstreamresponse each time I receive a responsep

Negative 18 pOkay, I have some very simple code which I will post below. Essentially, I have a connection to a database and I want to map a subset of columns in a query to a particular class. The problem is that it is possible for these to be null.p  pI would like to know if it is possible if an exception is thrown at a particular line, can we resume the entire block from the next line.p  pSo if this code below was to execute and Line 6 catches an error. Is there an elegant way to catch the exception and make the code resume running at line 7. Essentially making it as though line 6 was never executed.p  precode private static Column MapTableToColumnOracleDataReader reader         Column c  new Column         c.ColumnName  Convert.ToStringreader[COLUMNNAME]         c.DataType  Convert.ToStringreader[DATATYPE]         c.DataLength  Convert.ToInt32reader[DATALENGTH]         c.DataPrecision   Convert.ToInt32reader[DataPrecision]ltLine 6         c.DataScale  Convert.ToInt32reader[Datascale]lt Line 7         c.AllowDBNull  Convert.ToBooleanreader[ALLOWDBNULL]         c.IsReadOnly  Convert.ToBooleanreader[ISREADONLY]         c.IsLong  Convert.ToBooleanreader[ISLONG]         c.IsKey  Convert.ToBooleanreader[ISKEY]         c.KeyType  Convert.ToStringreader[KEYTYPE]         c.IsUnique  Convert.ToBooleanreader[ISUNIQUE]         c.Description  Convert.ToStringreader[DESCRIPTION]         return c      codepre  pIt is important to note I am not asking for best practice, it is not something I intend to use in actual code unless its absolutely genius. I simply want to know if this is possible and how one would go about doing this if it were. p  h2My Researchh2  pMost of my research is proactive as opposed to reactive. I would attempt to know if it is possible for the given field to be null before it is read from. If it is, then Id do a check to determine if the field is null and then set it to a default value. It essentially avoids the possibility of an error happening which I believe is a very good solution. I just wanted to attempt this as I know that when an exception is thrown, the most inner exception contains the line number at which it was thrown. Based on this if you put the exception inside of the class throwing the exception you should hypothetically be able to use reflection in order to continue running from its last point. Im just not sure how youd go about doing this. Ive also considered the possibly of putting try catches around every single line which I think would be very effective however, I think that it would be very ugly.p

Negative 18 pI am working on an application that will eventually be an api for driving UI Tests for a WPF application.p  pAt one point of the initial test we are working on, we get 2 Windows security popups. We have some code that loops 10 times, it gets the handle of one of the popups using the FindWindowByCaption method and enters the information and clicks ok.p  p9 times out of 10 this works just fine, however we are occasionally seeing what looks to be a race condition. My suspicion is that the loop starts when only one of the windows is open and while its entering the information the second one opens and steals focus after this it just hangs indefinitely.p  pWhat Im wondering is if there is any method to get all of the window handles for a given caption, so that we can wait until there are 2 before starting the loop.p

Negative 18 pI apologize if I missed something and this question doesnt make sense or the answer wasnt obvious to me when reading through the PostSharp documentation.p  pI have created a simple logging aspect that uses a custom logging service to put details about a WCF method call into a database. Once the logging aspect is called, it needs to continue on its own and not hold up the execution of the WCF method itself.

Negative 18 pOK, so I have an assignment where we have to create a low end battleship program in Java using the GUI. We have to create an array of codeJLabelcode objects, with an image attached, for the water. I have done this using codeGridLayoutcode. p  pThe board comes up fine, but if I try and add a ship, I am at this point just trying to see how to add a ship onto the board, I end up either not having anything show up, or, as in the case of the code I have at the moment, I can get ships on the board to show up, but they tend to overlap each other. there was a problem with them going over the edge, but I sorted that part out.p  pSo I was wondering if someone wouldnt mind having a look at my code and tell me if I am going about this all wrong. Is codeGridLayoutcode the way to go, or should I be utilizing some other method Id also like to know if there is a more efficent way of going about manipulating the ships, especially so they dont overlap, beacuse I cant seem to find any real effective way.

Negative 18 pLets say I have two files, name.codencode.rar and name.coden1code.rar, which appear to be part of the same set same size, etc. Is there any easy way to tell if theyre emactuallyem part of the same set, without first downloading the full set Currently the only way I can tell is by downloading an instance of every file and and then seeing if WinRAR gives me an error when I try to unwrap them.p  pAnd on a related note, assuming there is such a method, can I do the same without having adjacent partsp  pIdeally theres an existing program that can do this, but I can code my own if necessary.p  pFurther notes These are two sets of archives of the same file. They appear identical to obvious checks filenames are subsequent, contents are sane, sizes are identical, same number of parts. I then receive a full set of files. If theyre not from the same set, I cant unrar them  though it seems that WinRAR will proceed to 100 before giving me the CRC error file corrupt.p

Negative 18 pEver since I did sockets programming on a PDP11, its been the case that IP fragmentation will take care of the case where an IP datagram such as a UDP datagram is larger than the MTU for the segment allows.p  pThus, I can send a UDP datagram of size 30 kB, and it might fragment to 20 segments of 1.5 kB on Ethernet, and then fragment each into three segments of lt576 bytes later on for some particular wireless link, and as long as all the fragments make it to the other end, the UDP datagram makes it to the other end.p  pThen, I came across the documentation for the UDP socket in node.js, which claims that routers will drop datagrams that do not fit the MTU of the next segment. I thought this was only the case for datagrams with the dont fragment bit set in the header, but given that node.js is supposed to be a high quality product with some credibility in network circles, Im wondering whether I missed something and  many routers will now treat all datagrams as if they are dont fragmentp  pHeres the link a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapidgram.htmldgramsocketsendbufoffsetlengthportaddresscallback relnofollowhttpnodejs.orgapidgram.htmldgramsocketsendbufoffsetlengthportaddresscallbackap  pHeres the quotep  precodegenerally sending a datagram greater than the receiver MTU  wont work the packet gets silently dropped, without informing  the source that the data did not reach its intended recipient. codepre  pSo, did I miss something, or does the node.js documentation need an updatep

Negative 18 pI have view with 3 widgets. Two codeTbButtoncode widgets and one codeTbExtendedGridViewcode widget. Buttons are used for insert new user and create pdf. TbExtendedGridView is used to list current users and their attributes. codeTbExtendedGridViewcode has filtering turned on and is working fine. p  pController is simple.

If not, it renders a default view that shows all users.p  pWhat i need is the ability to create a PDF of that table.p  pI installed PDF extensions and created PDFReport controller. When user clicks on create pdf button, he goes to that controller which than creates PDF. All is fine until I want to create PDF out of filtered data.p  pFirst thing that came across my mind was to pass variables from filters to Create pdf buttons link so that once its clicked i will send relevant data to PDFReport controller which would than be able to filter data and create filtered PDF.p  pProblem is that filtering is done via AJAX request and it refreshes only table.

Negative 18 pI created a custom CKEditor Plugin that takes a text value and inserts it into some HTML.  Everything works fine, but I dont know how to populate the field with a default value.  I would like the default value to be blank if it is a new element.  But i would like the default value to be the value of the selected item while editing it.  Otherwise I am unable to edit the value inside of the HTML without going into Source mode, or completely deleting everything and starting over again.p  precodeCKEDITOR.dialog.add videoLinkDialog, function editor     return      title  Video Properties,     minWidth  400,     minHeight  200,     contents      [                id  general,         label  Settings,         elements          [                        type  html,             html  This dialog window lets you embed Vimeo videos on your website.           ,                        type  text,             id  url,             label  Video ID,             validate  CKEDITOR.dialog.validate.notEmpty This field cannot be empty. ,             required  true,             commit  function data                             data.text  this.getValue                        ,         ]            ],     onOk  function            val  this.getContentElementgeneral, url.getInputElement.getValue       var text  lta classcolorboxinline hrefhttpplayer.vimeo.comvideo  val  width915ampampheight515ampampiframetrueampampautoplay1gtltimg classvidthumbnail srchttpplacehold.it350x150 datavimeoid  val   gtltagt       this.getParentEditor.insertHtmltext     ,      codepre

Negative 18 pI couldnt find a question that was not too specific to some case, so Ill try to make this very generic.p  pWe need an extractor base class to a set of documents, for example. Each document has its specific properties, but theyre ultimately documents. So we want to provide common extraction operations for all of them.p  pEven though theyre all documents, as I said, theyre somewhat different. Some may have some properties, but some may not.p  pLets imagine that we have the codeDocumentcode base abstract class, and the codeFancyDocumentcode and codeNotSoFancyDocumentcode classes that inherit from it. The codeFancyDocumentcode has a codeSectionAcode, the codeNotSoFancyDocumentcode doesnt.p  pThat said, what would you defend as the best way of implementing this Heres the two optionsp  ul libEmpty virtual methods on the base classbli ul  pEmpty virtual methods on the base class would allow the programmer to only override the methods that make sense for the different types of documents. We would then have a default behavior on the abstract base class, which would be returning the codedefaultcode for the methods, like thisp  precodepublic abstract class Document      public virtual SectionA GetDocumentSectionA              return defaultSectionA        public class FancyDocument  Document      public override SectionA GetDocumentSectionA               Specific implementation                    public class NotSoFancyDocument  Document       Does not implement method GetDocumentSectionA because it doesnt have a SectionA  codepre  ul libConcrete empty methods or concrete methods throwing a codeNotImplementedExceptioncodebli ul  pSince the codeNotSoFancyDocumentcode bdoes notb have a codeSectionAcode, but the others do, we could either just return the idefaulti for the method in it, or we could throw a codeNotImplementedExceptioncode. That would depend on how the program was written and some other things. We could come up with something like thisp  precode Return the default value  public abstract class Document      public abstract SectionA GetDocumentSectionA   public class FancyDocument  Document      public override SectionA GetDocumentSectionA               Specific implementation        public class NotSoFancyDocument  Document      public override SectionA GetDocumentSectionA              return defaultSectionA       codepre  pbORbp  precode Throw an exception  public abstract class Document      public abstract SectionA GetDocumentSectionA   public class FancyDocument  Document      public override SectionA GetDocumentSectionA               Specific implementation        public class NotSoFancyDocument  Document      public override SectionA GetDocumentSectionA              throw new NotImplementedExceptionNotSoFancyDocument does not have a section A       codepre  pPersonally, I do think that the abstract method approach is better, since it means Hey, I need you to be able to get a SectionA to be a document. I dont care how. while the virtual method means Hey, I do have this SectionA here. If its not good enough for you, feel free to change the way I get it..p  pI do think the first one is a sign of object oriented programming smell.p  pWhat are your opinions on thisp

Negative 18 pBeen banging my head against a brick wall for sometime with this problem. Was hoping I may be able to get some help here.p  pBasically, my game has an inventory system with a number of different objects. There are different classes derived from the base class Object and they use virtual functions in order to have different behaviour with the same function call. p  pOriginally, I had a list inventory as well as a listiterator invIter. The iterator would call the functions I needed for the right object in the inventory but would only call base class functions. I read from another answer that the reason for this is because you lose the polymorphic nature when you do this but having a list of pointers would remedy it.p  pSo I changed the list and iterator so they were Object pointers and found out the supposedly correct way to access the functions and variables of the inventory objects. However, when these functions or variables get accessed at runtime, the program has an unhandled exception and breaks.p  pThis is my code which causes the issue....p  pHeaderp  precodeinclude Object.h include ltvectorgt include ltlistgt  using namespace std  class Player  public     Player      void addItemObject     void printInventory      listltObjectgt inventory  private         listltObjectgtiterator invIter         codepre  pcppp  precodeinclude Player.h include Object.h  include ltiostreamgt    PlayerPlayer     void PlayeraddItemObject newItem      inventory.pushbackampnewItem     return    void PlayerprintInventory      cout ltlt YOU ARE CARRYING n     forinvIterinventory.begin invIterinventory.end invIter                      cout ltlt invItergtgetName ltlt ,             cout ltlt nPRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE...     cin.ignore1     return  codepre  pAny help is much appreciated, Ive honestly hit a dead end myself.p

Negative 18 pLets say I have a UI thread and a background thread that subscribe to a custom threadsafe ObservableCollection that I created so that whenever the collection changes it executes the callback within the appropriate context. p  pNow lets say I add something to the collection from either thread, doesnt matter which one and it now has to marshall the callback to both threads. To execute the callback within the UIs context I can simply do a Dispatcher.Invoke... and it executes the callback within the UIs context great. p  pNow I want to execute the callback within the background threads context dont ask me why, it may well be that whatever its accessing is affinitized to that specific thread or has threadlocal storage it needs to access how would I do that p  pBackground threads dont have a dispatchermessage pumping mechanism so I cant use a dispatcher or SynchronizationContext, so how would one interrupt a background thread and have it execute my callback within its contextp  pEDIT I keep getting answers that are obviously wrong so I must not have explained myself correctly. Forget the UI thread and UI dispatchers guys, they were meant to marshall calls to the UI thread, thats it Imagine two worker threads A and B. If A modifies my collection then A is in charge of marshalling the callback to itself and to B. Executing the callback within As context is easy since A was the one triggering it  simply call the delegate in place. Now A needs to marshall the callback to B... now what Dispatcher and SynContext are emuselessem in this situation.p

Negative 18 pI am using MVC5, which contains a form with the following fieldsp  precodeStudentType  Radio button GradId  dropdown HSYearofGradId  dropdown CollegeStatusId  dropdown codepre  pWith those fields, I want to apply a validation rule on codeHSYearofGradIdcode, based on what they select. For example if they select a codeStudentTypecode strongAstrong, they will only see codeGradIdcode and only if they select the third item in codeGradIdcode they will see codeHSYearofGradIdcode. Similarly if they select codeStudentTypecode strongBstrong, then they see both codeGradIdcode and codeHSYearofGradIdcode. The key here is that codeStudentTypecode strongAstrong and strongBstrong are different, so the error message should show a different value.p  pI have the following error message codeYou must select an option for your year of 0 in order to proceed.code I want to replace the 0 with a value on the client side.p  pAfter stepping through the JavaScript, I noticed that my string was being replaced at first, but then it was being overridden by the original error I set codeYou must select an option for your year of 0 in order to proceed. I noticed this in one validators internalscode.validator.formatmessage.replacetheregex, 1, rule.parameters which changes the 0 into [object object].p  pI was using the following question as reference a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23008631howtochangemvccustomclientsidevalidationerrormessageatruntimeusingj23009749noredirect1comment3683929223009749How to change MVC custom clientside validation error message at runtime using jQueryap  pSo, I used MVCs unobtrusive client side validation feature.

Negative 18 pa few days ago i posted a question about Serializing the ResponseStatus property with BinaryFormatter. Mythz pointed out it wasnt the fastest way to go, so i decided to switch to another formatter. Tried ProtoBuff and MsgPack, and am on ProtoBuf now.p  pMy real question is im trying to grasp how Protobuf knows how ServiceStack Dtos should be serialized. I tried adding all the possible attributes to my existing dto, ProtoContract and ProtoMember0,1,2,3,etc, but also DataContract and DataMember. p  pOn top of that i dont use ServiceStacks own client, but try to serialize the request to an existing stream. p  pIf i dont do this  p  precodeServiceStack.ProtoBuf.ProtoBufFormat.Model.Add typeofNameSpacePlaceholder.Service.Dto.GetNodes, false codepre  pi get an error about Types and Contracts that cannot be infered,  If i do add that piece of code, all continues great, but the deserialized object is empty.p  pIm using this to Serialize  p  precodeServiceStack.ProtoBuf.ProtoBufFormat.Model.Serialize ms, myObject codepre  pand to Deserialize  p  precodeServiceStack.ProtoBuf.ProtoBufFormat.Model.Deserialize ms, null, deserializationType codepre  pI think im missing something here. Could it have something to do with namespaces I looked into some code from ServiceStack.ProtoBuff, it isnt so hard to understand, but i cannot get it going. p  pThings that are unclear to me now  p  ol liIs there a need to add Attributes to the existing DTOs  in ProtoBuf V2 i can also do it in code, i read, but for now i can also alter the existing DTOs  li liDo i need to initialize the Requestand response DTOs, in my ClientSerialize as wel in my ServerDeserialize  li liIs there some reason why i should not be serializing to my own Stream li ol  pMany thanks, p
Negative 18 pI have a growing WPF solution where I have multiple projects within.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTxbZ8.png altenter image description herep  pI have one main moduleselection project that acts as the entry point when launching the application. From this one I typically load one or more of the module projects.p  pI have several moduleprojects that are quite big and are currently set up as class libraries. At the bottom I have a common resource project where I keep and maintain all resources that are common for all the modules typically themes, colors, control stylesp  pWhen everything is in one project you can define your global resources in the app.xaml. When you have resources in class libraries I believe this works as well runtime, but not designtime. The workaround is linking in the resources from every control or page that needs it. This latter solution works, but will then spend time loading the resources everywhere you define it and this impacts performance significantly.p  pWhat is the best practice to achieve dividing your LOB application into multiple projects while maintaining global resources in an proper fashionp

Negative 18 pI have been trying to set up an AWS Free Tier account using an EC2 instance and an RDS database running MySQL. Unfortunately, I cannot figure out how to grant access to the database from the EC2 instance. I have read all of the AWS documentation, but it is unfortunately out of date as are all the questions posted on StackOverflow. All of the documentation states that I should go to the Security Groups section of the RDS Dashboard. However, when I do so, this is what Im confronted with.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comImz19.png altenter image description herep  p I would have included the image but I dont have the reputation for it.p  pOkay, I understand that I am not using the EC2Classic platform and that I must make these changes to the Security Group in the EC2 Dashboard, but how I do not want public access to port 3306, I only want the EC2 instance to be able to communicate with the RDS database on a private subnet. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThe links to AWS Documentation on Supported Platforms and Using RDS in VPC are not helpful. They are outdated and also keep referring me back to Security Groups under the RDS Dashboard, which then only shows me this message.p

Negative 18 pI am used to designing Android layouts in XML and am wondering if there are parallels I can draw from this in my HTML design that I am currently working on.

In the original, the top bar is not an image logo, but a codenavbarbrandcode and so everything seems to fit together quite well. I have replaced the SBAdmin up top with a logo .png which is notably bigger. The effect is that quite a bit of content as well as the n in the side navbar have been covered up. p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is how I can specify relative positioning,or how should I go about laying out this page so that everything is displayed I am looking for something akin to codenavbarlayoutbelowlogo.pngcode type of thing in XML.p  pCurrently my solution was to modify the .css associated with the navbar and the content and give them both a higher margintop, but this seems like a very hacky way to solve this problem. So my question is, is there a way to specify relative positioning within HTML, or am I supposed to trial and error with margins on my local machine, or else, what is the proper way to lay things out so that all content within the three Views shown in my example are displayed without overlapping each otherp  precodeltdiv idwrappergt      ltdiv classnavbar navbarinverse navbarfixedtop rolenavigationgt         ltdiv classnavbarheadergt             ltbutton typebutton classnavbartoggle datatogglecollapse datatarget.navbarex1collapsegt             ltspan classsronlygtToggle navigationltspangt             ltspan classiconbargtltspangt             ltspan classiconbargtltspangt             ltspan classiconbargtltspangt             ltbuttongt         ltimg srclogo.png classnavbarbrandgt     ltdivgt       ltdiv classcollapse navbarcollapse navbarex1collapsegt         ltul classnav navbarnav sidenavgt lt This only looks ok if I change sidenav margin gt             ltli classactivegtlta hrefindex.htmlgtDashboardltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefcharts.htmlgtAdoptionltagtltligt             ltligtlta hreftables.htmlgtUsage Statisticsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefforms.htmlgtClassifiersltagtltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classcontainergt         ltpgtHeyltpgt ltthis top here gets cut offgt         ltpgtHeyltpgt         ltpgtWhats upltpgt         ltpgtWhats upltpgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pEDIT Not necessarily relative layouts, I am looking for solutions that avoid hardcoding margin values, which is what I currently find myself doing, or if this is not bad practice I would also accept an answer that explains why not i.e. would such a solution generalize to all screen sizes. p

Negative 18 pIm trying to vertically align a logo and UL within a navigation bar. Ive got pretty close and it looks fine really, however there is some extra space underneath and above them both that I cant account for. Ive set the padding on the links and logo to allow the user to be able to click them more easily. p  pPlace the mouse underneath the logo and underneath the nav bar, Ive tried to do it so that as soon as your mouse reaches the nav bar, it hits the padding of the logo and therefore the mouse cursor turns to pointer. However, there is a gap there...using the developer tools, I can see that its the div.inner element...but it says it has a margin. Ive tried setting the margin to 0 on that div and it doesnt go away.p  pHere is the jsfiddle example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netForresty0smpmsqn2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netForresty0smpmsqn2ap  pIm using the same vertical alignment method as here a hrefhttpwebdesign.tutsplus.comtutorialstheholygrailofcsscenteringcms22114 relnofollowhttpwebdesign.tutsplus.comtutorialstheholygrailofcsscenteringcms22114ap  pHere is the HTMLp  precodeltnavgt     ltdiv classoutergt         ltdiv classinnergt             ltdiv classlogo1gtLOGOltdivgt             ltulgt                 ltligtlta href classbordergtAboutltagtltligt                                     ltligtlta href classbordergtMy Workltagtltligt                                     ltligtlta hrefgtContactltagtltligt             ltulgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltnavgt codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 18 pI have a menu controller that when it pops up has a collection view. The way it works is that when the user taps outside the collection view it should make the menu dismiss. The menu dismisses when you tap outside the collection view, but it also dismisses when you tap inside the collection view. I cant seem to get the gesture recognizer to only dismiss when it is not inside the collection view. I have looked around on here and google and I havent found any solution yet that works. Here is the code for the function that handles the tapp  precode    IBAction func handleTapsender MenuTapGestureRecognizer              if sender.state  .Ended ampamp sender.view  menuCollectionView                      NSLogmenuCollectionView                  else if sender.state  .Ended ampamp sender.view  mainView                      self.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nil                codepre  pcodemainViewcode is a reference that is connected to the top most view and codemenuCollectionViewcode is the reference to the UICollectionView.p
Negative 18 pI am trying to query a collection based on a date field. My collection has a field of type datetime stamp. However I would like to ignore the time stamp and just use the date portion.

Negative 18 pI am trying to reconfigure an app I had working in ios7 but now in ios8 is not. I want to have the app function as an iBeacon when a button is pressed alerting others in the area that I want to communicate with them over bluetooth.  after about one second of being a beacon I have it start a central manager to scan for a bluetooth service that transmits some data.p  pThe same app on another device is already using locationManager to scan for the iBeacon regionUUId and identifier that is advertised when the button was pushed.  When the locationManager sees that it has entered the region with the identifier an alert is presented.  If the user taps the OK button on the alert then a peripheralManager starts to advertise the transfer UUID that is now being looked for on the first device for about one second.  It then stops advertising this and starts a peripheralManager with a new iBeacon UUID and identifier for about 1 sec.  Finally this stops and a centralManager starts scanning for a service UUID.p  pWhen this happens the first device first connects to the peripheral service and gets the information sent and then starts a peripheralManager to send information through a transfer service to the second device.p  pI have the location alerts working on both devices.  so that the second devices gets the invite to communicate and the first device gets the response.  However the centralManager never sees the peripheralManager and connects.  Either because the peripheral isnt sending or the central isnt scanning correctly.  p  pBelow is my code with some comments.  If everyone would look and see where I have messed up I would really appreciate it.  p  pLike I said it was working fine under ios7 and Xcode 5.  Maybe in trying to get it to work I changed something around that I dont remember.p  precodeTHESE ARE MY BEACON REGIONS  UUIDString  9F0ED9D4C40A4BFEA8B3C183365D8303  self.inviteField.hidden  NO NSUUID  uid  [[NSUUID alloc] initWithUUIDStringUUIDString] self.beaconRegion  [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUIDuid identifieridentifierString]  NSUUID  uid2  [[NSUUID alloc] initWithUUIDStringC74E2565516C40AF9ABFA9ABEBDE3188] self.beaconRegion2  [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUIDuid2 identifiercom.checkers.bluetooth] [self.beaconRegion2 setNotifyEntryStateOnDisplayYES] [self.beaconRegion2 setNotifyOnEntryYES] [self.beaconRegion2 setNotifyOnExitYES]  NSUUID  uid10  [[NSUUID alloc] initWithUUIDString77D6DF80E3944926A4C8F55C4F02B12F] self.beaconRegion10  [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUIDuid10 identifiercom.checkersok.bluetooth] [self.beaconRegion10 setNotifyEntryStateOnDisplayYES] [self.beaconRegion10 setNotifyOnEntryYES] [self.beaconRegion10 setNotifyOnExitYES]   I CONFIURE MY LOCATION MANAGER REGIONS void configureReceiver   self.locationManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]  self.locationManager.delegate  self  [self.locationManager startMonitoringForRegionself.beaconRegion2]  [self.locationManager startRangingBeaconsInRegionself.beaconRegion2]  void configureReceiver9      self.locationManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]     self.locationManager.delegate  self     [self.locationManager startMonitoringForRegionself.beaconRegion10]     [self.locationManager startRangingBeaconsInRegionself.beaconRegion10]      voidcentralManagerDidUpdateStateCBCentralManager central      if central.state  CBCentralManagerStatePoweredOn          NSLogcentral On          timer4  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval.5                                                   targetself                                                 selectorselectorchangeuuid4                                                 userInfonil                                                  repeatsYES]       else         return           voidcentralManagerCBCentralManager central didDiscoverPeripheralCBPeripheral peripheral advertisementDataNSDictionary advertisementData RSSINSNumber RSSI      if RSSI.integerValue gt 15          return          if RSSI.integerValue lt 35          return          if self.discoveredPeripheral  peripheral          self.discoveredPeripheral  peripheral         [self.centralManager connectPeripheralperipheral optionsnil]          If the connection fails for whatever reason, we need to deal with it.  voidcentralManagerCBCentralManager central didFailToConnectPeripheralCBPeripheral peripheral errorNSError error      [self cleanup]         Weve connected to the peripheral, now we need to discover the services and characteristics to find the transfer characteristic.   voidcentralManagerCBCentralManager central didConnectPeripheralCBPeripheral peripheral      [self.centralManager stopScan]      [self.data setLength0]      peripheral.delegate  self      [peripheral discoverServices[[CBUUID UUIDWithString266E27C4E95848B5ACDA5953C4E04EB6]]]     voidperipheralCBPeripheral peripheral didDiscoverServicesNSError error      if error          [self cleanup]         return            Discover the characteristic we want...

This queries a Solr instance, gets the results and massages them into the format I want.

Negative 18 pI recently created a tournament system that will soon lead into player rankings. Basically, after players are done with the tournament, they are given a rank based on how they did in the tournament. So the person who won the tournament will have the most points and be ranked 1, while the second will have the second most points  and be ranked 2, and so on...p  pHowever, after they are ranked in the new rankings, they can challenge other members and have a way to play other members and change their ranks. So basically using a ranking system, if Player A who is ranked 2 beats Player B who is ranked 1, Player A will now become 1. p  pIve also decided that if a player wants to compete in the rankings but was not present during the tournament, they can sign up after the tournament, and will be given the lowest possible rank with the lowest points but they have a chance to move up.p  pSo now, I am wanting to know which way should I go about planning this. When I convert the players from tournament to match rankings, I have to identify them with points in order to rank them. I decided this seems like the best way to do it.p  precode1  1000 2  900 3  800 4  700 5  600 6  500 7  400 8  300 9  200 10 100  codepre  pAfter looking on the internet Ive decided it would be wise to use ELO to give players their new rank after they players have matched against each other.. I went about it on this page a hrefhttpwww.lifewithalacrity.com200601rankingsystems.html relnofollowhttpwww.lifewithalacrity.com200601rankingsystems.htmlap  pSo if I go about it this way, lets say I have rank 10 facing rank 1. According to the website above, my formula isp  precodeR  R  K  S  E codepre  pand the rating of 10 only has 100 points where 1 has 1,000. So after doing the math rank 10s expected value of beating 1 isp  precode1  [ 1  10   [1000  100]  400 ]  0.55 codepre  pSo      100  32  1  0.52       115.36p  pThe problem I have with ELO is it makes no sense. After A rank such as 10 beats 1, he should not gain something as low as 15 points. Im not sure if im doing the math wrong, or if Im splitting up the points wrong. Or maybe I shouldnt use ELO at all Any suggestions would be very helpfulp

Negative 18 pIm working on a application which processes a substantial quantity of video files. One of the processing steps involves creating a storyboard of the video contents by taking screenshots at certain points. p  pCurrently we are accomplishing this by writing the video from memory to disk, calling ffmpeg to generate a screenshot at a specified time, reading the screenshot to memory, then deleting both the video and screenshot from disk. p  pThe problem is that this is a substantial number of large disk operations, which are turning into a bottleneck. p  pIdeally, what Id like to do is to take the screenshots without ever writing the video or screenshot to disk The video is contained in memory at the time of processing, and all the videos have been transcoded to the mp4 format.p  pIs there a way to accomplish this, with or without ffmpeg p

Negative 18 pIm trying to adopt SOLID principles in my app.p  pSay I have these 2 modelsp  pstrongClientstrong fieldscodeidcode, codenamecode, codeaddresscode etc which emhasManyemp  pstrongHoldingsstrong fieldscodeidcode, codeclientidcode, codetickercode, codeholdingdatecode, codevaluecodep  pIn my ClientsController I might have a method like sop  precodepublic function showid   client  Clientfindid  clientgtsetValuations  valuations  clientgtgetValuations       return Viewmakeclients.showwithcompactclient, valuations  codepre  pSo in the controller I want to get the valuations over time for the client. The codesetValuationscode on my client model performs a fairly complex query which sums the holdings for a client and sets the resulant collection as a property on the client.p  pSo my client model might look a bit likep  precodeclass Client extends Eloquent     All the usual model stuff   protected valuations   public function setValuations     thisgtvaluations  DBtableholdings         gtselectholdings.holdingdate, DBrawSUMholdings.value AS sumofvalue          gtwhereholdings.clientid, thisgtid         gtwhereholdings.holdingdate, DBrawLASTDAYholdings.holdingdate          gtgroupByholdings.holdingdate         gtorderByholdings.holdingdate, asc         gtget         return this     public function getValuations     return thisgtvaluations    codepre  pAs we can see this is a fair amount of crap to put in a model and I have condensed it a lot for the sake of brevity. I should think that using a repository pattern might be the best approach but Im unsure of how to structure this. Assuming I have several clientrelated attributes that need a fair amount of querying or processing to determine what they are such as emreturnsem, emtransactions in client currencyem  this would require applying fx conversion to a collection of values, for example, how would be the best way to structure this and where should the logic be placedp

Negative 18 pI was wondering about the naming conventions in C, specifically where and what gets capitalized. I guess what Im asking is having come from languages like Java and C why are things like stdvector and stdstring are not capitalizedp  pAs a follow up, if I was typedefing a stdstring to be something else in my case a world, should I call it ...p  precode typedef stdstring world codepre  porp  precode typedef stdstring World codepre  pIve looked around at previous posts and style guides several listed below, but none seemed to address this directly links below. The Google guide said The names of all types  classes, structs, typedefs, and enums  have the same naming convention. Type names should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. No underscores. So that makes it seem like it should be the latter  but this seems odd since the std library doesnt even slightly follow this convention. Is it just one of those things where a bunch of people wrote the std library before styles were standardized and now for compatibility reason it is too late to changeupdate itp  pThanksp  pPrevious Researchp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4883027cnamingconventionC Naming Conventionali lia hrefhttpgeosoft.nodevelopmentcppstyle.html relnofollowhttpgeosoft.nodevelopmentcppstyle.htmlali lia hrefhttpgooglestyleguide.googlecode.comsvntrunkcppguide.html relnofollowhttpgooglestyleguide.googlecode.comsvntrunkcppguide.htmlali ul

Negative 18 pMainly is there any difference between using nginx as load balancer for bunch of upstream servers. Or using small nodejs proxy server that acts like a proxy between bunch of servers and one public hosting. p  pIt may look obvious to you but to me nginx is very new. And i barely know anything about it..p  pAlso i guess my question is there any performance advantage for using nginx as proxy server that distribute load vs running your own node js code that acts a proxy between other requests. p
Negative 18 pIve seen this question asked numerous times, and there are numerous suggestions on how to fix this issue.  Ive built several dozen or so Spring MVC webapps, and I am quite confident that I have built this application correctly.  I can compilebuild the webapp with no problems, and when I deploy the app to Tomcat, it all works fine.   I can see the URLs to my RESTful webservices, and I can see that they are working perfectly.p  pThis is a maven multimodule project, where I start with a parent project, and then I have modules for entity, dao, services, lastly the ws or webservices.  The parent project builds everything fine.  I can open and disect every jar to make sure I have all the correct config and logging files.p  pSo, this issue that has to do with a Spring RESTful webservices URL path not found ... this seems to only be a problem when I run my project from the Tomcat 8 Server in Eclipse.   I closed the other modules entity, dao, services and when I build the webservices webapp, I can see the proper jars in the lib directory.  p  pMy project gets syncronized with Tomcat, and when I run it, I get the error.p  pThe problem has to be specific to how the maven projects are built within maven and maybe how Eclipse is configured to see this project.p  pI can provide the error if needed, I can provide any config files as needed. Just wondering what type of Eclipse configuration I might need to change.p  pThanksp

Then I split them and took code[0]code, which is the vehicle name, and have to first check if it is one of those vehicle names in the codeArrayListcode derived from txt file, and if it is then have to refer it to that particular object I created above. And then have to take in the code[1]code, which is command that corresponds to the particular behaviour of object, which can be codepowerOncode, codespeedUpcode, etc etc..p  precodefor int i0 ilt vehicleNamesArray.size i      if vehicleNamesArray.geti.matchesuserVehicleName       userVehicleName is the [0] vehicle name entered by user       userVehicleCommand is the [1] command entered by user              switch userVehicleCommand.toLowerCase                   case power on             newVehicle.powerOn calling that particular bahaviour of the object defined in Vehicle class.

I.e., when I say Audi, powerON, it still prints out Porsche is powered ON.p  pI think I messed up in linking the user entered name to check with the codeArrayListcode and then refering it to that particular object.p

Negative 18 pSorry if the title did not match the actual question. Im not sure how to phrase this.p  pIn Postgres, I have users that can be at a station. The stations are numbered 1 to 5.

Negative 18 pI have a requirement of reading User Information from 2 different sources db per userId and storing consolidated information in a Map with key as userId. Users in numbers can vary based on period they have opted for. Group of users may belong to different Period of Year.eg daily, weekly, monthly users.p  pI used HashMap and LinkedHashMap to get this done. As it slows down the process and to make it faster, I thought of using Threading here.p  pReading some tutorials and examples now I am using ConcurrentHashMap and ExecutorService.p  ol lipIn cases based on some validation I want to skip the current iteration and move to next User info. It doesnot allow to use strongcontinue keywordstrong to use within for loop. Is there any way to achieve same differently within Multithreaded code.pli lipMoreover below code piece though it works, but its not significantly that faster than the code without threading which creates doubt if Executor Service is implemented correctly. pli lipstrongHow do we debug in case we get any error in Multithreaded code.

Negative 18 pSo, I have a navigation controller, which is connected to a view controller. From that view controller you can go to a the same type view controller but with different content. The view controllers are memory intense, so its quiet expensive to push each new one of them. The problem is that when I click the back button and view controller gets popped, the memory doesnt release itself. Is there something I should do, like set thing that I dont use to nil etc.  Because, suppose that I have 5 images to display, each of them takes 510 mb in memory, when I push a new view controller on top of the one I was on I spend 3050mbs of memory, and that is okay, but when I click the Back button and the view controller gets popped up, I expect these 50mbs to be released. That is not the case, however. Can somebody give me a hint on what should I do to manage this memory more efficiently p  pAlso, is there a a nice way to free memory taken by UIImageView in Swiftp  pSo, to be more precise, view controllers deinit doesnt get called when view controller gets poped from navigation stack. The same applies to some custom subviews of that view controller. How can I ensure that they get cleaned by ARC, and are there any tools that can help me track references that keep these things in memory.p

Negative 18 pI am building a website using bootstrap, which has some minimal content on top basically title, subtitle, and a navigation bar.

The content on top will be rather minimal, so on a small screen, its unlikely the top and center will touch.

The values in all the input elements should be overwritten from clipboard data. Therefore the controller implements a function which parses the clipboard data and sets the value for each input element. The values from clipboard are strongview valuesstrong. Since the controller has no idea how to calculate strongmodel valuesstrong from these view values, it has to use the parsers pipeline from ngModelController.

Negative 18 pThe answer  Calling a nonvirtual function will use the function from the same class as the pointer type, regardless of whether the object was actually created as some other derived type. Whereas calling a virtual function will use the function from the original allocated object type, regardless of what kind of pointer youre using. was the best to me in the question link  a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions19736281whatarethedifferencesbetweenoverridingvirtualfunctionsandhidingnonvir1973708519737085newrega467f2daf85647968a350395d17cea61What are the differences between overriding virtual functions and hiding nonvirtual functionsap  pHowever, I still dont see the benefits of making a function virtual.

Negative 18 pFirst of all, I should say that I am a newbie on Java and Android programming. I am very experienced in C programming for embedded systems, but now I need to communicate one of my embedded projects with an Android app, in a very simple way. I am using one of those ESP8266, configured as default. Thus, it behaves as a basic telnet server. My microcontroller has to send a question through a string, which is not constant to my app, and receive a Y or N reply. I have tested it using a telnet client, and it is working fine. However, I want to have an app that pops up an alert dialog andor show the message in a TextView element, and sends the reply after some button click. For this, I have adapted a telnet client code fromp  pa hrefhttpandroider.blogspot.com.br201408simpleandroidchatapplicationclient.html relnofollowhttpandroider.blogspot.com.br201408simpleandroidchatapplicationclient.htmlap  pI have put everything in one single panel, and reduced the number of elements to a textview element and 4 buttons connect, disconnect, yes, and no. I am using a fixed IP and port to connect the app to my laptop, which is running a telnet server hercules. The connection is confirmed, and the YES and NO buttons are sending the correct messages. However, the question string never shows up at the TextView element. I have also added an AlertDialog to pop up, because I think it is more appropriate to the kind of app I am developing.p  pNotice that the testing of the message income happens inside a thread, and I am calling the TextView update and the AlertDialog show using runOnUiThread. p  pHere is the Java code not optimized yetp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre

Negative 18 pI have a few WCF Web Services that I would like to test in Azures staging area instead of deploying directly to the production area.  p  pHeres the setupp  pI have two cloud services a hrefhttps1.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttps1.cloudapp.neta and a hrefhttps2.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttps2.cloudapp.neta.  These cloud service endpoints are endpoints in a traffic manager a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.trafficmanager.net relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.trafficmanager.neta.  I have a DNS alias of a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma mapped to the traffic manager url.p  pMy client is setup to establish an SSL connection using the certificate for a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma.  p  pWhen I deploy to staging I edit my host file to use the staging ip to point to a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma and if I ping a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma I get the staging areas ip returned.  Yet when I call the services with my test client I am still hitting the endpoints behind the traffic manager url.p  pAdditionally, I have tried mapping the traffic manager url to the same virtual ip of the staging environment  but I get the same result.p  pHow can I call wcf services in Azures staging environment in this scenariop  pI havent had much luck on the web... Any help would be appreciated.p
