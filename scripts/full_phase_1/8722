These currently work just fine. strongMy problemstrong is that when ever I add a text label and text field the email one when ever I compile and run my report without errors the fields do not show up though theyre placed on the report.p  hr  pMy only guess, because I am very new to SQL, is that this persons SQL is what is making his fields work.

Negative 8722 pSomething happened that Im not sure should be possible.  Obviously it is, because Ive seen it, but I need to find the root cause amp I was hoping you all could help.p  pWe have a system that looks up latitude amp longitude for a zipcode.  Rather than access it every time, we cache the results in a cheap inmemory HashTable cache, since the lat amp long of a zip code tend to change less often than we release.p  pAnyway, the hash is surrounded by a class that has a get and add method that are both synchronized.  We access this class as a singleton.p  pIm not claiming this is the best setup, but its where were at.  I plan to change to wrap the Map in a Collections.synchronizedMap call ASAP.p  pWe use this cache in a multithreaded environment, where we thread 2 calls for 2 zips so we can calculate the distance between the two.  These sometimes happen at very nearly the same time, so its very possible that both calls access the map at the same time.p  pJust recently we had an incident where two different zip codes returned the same value.  Assuming that the initial values were actually different, is there any way that writing the values into the Map would cause the same value to be written for two different keys  Or, is there any way that 2 gets could cross wires and accidentally return the same valuep  pThe only other explanation I have is that the initial data was corrupt wrong values, but it seems very unlikely.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated.

Negative 8722 pA bit of history We have an application, which was originally written many years ago 1998 is the first date in PVCS but the app is about 5 years older than that as it originally was a DOS program. This application communicates with a piece of hardware via serial. When we got to Windows XP we started receiving reports of the app dying after a short time of running. It seems that the serial comms just died and the app was left in a stuck state. The only way to recover from this situation was to restart the application.p  pThe only information I can find regarding this problem was apparently the Windows Message system would miss that information was received, the buffer would fill and the system would get stuck. This snippet of information was left in a old word document, but theres no evidence to back this up. It also mentions that this is only prevalent at high baud rates 115200.p  pThe solution was to provide customers with USBSerial converters along with the hardware.p  pToday We are working on a new version of the hardware that will run across a network as well as serial ports. So to allow me to work on the network code, minus the actual hardware we are using a a hrefhttpwww.vscom.de666.htm relnofollowVSCOM NetCom113a device. It also installs a virtual comm port on the users ie mine machine.p  pNow I have got the network code integrated with the app, it appears that the NetCom device exhibits the same behaviour as a physical commport. This is undesirable as I need the app to run longer than 30 seconds.p  pGoogle turns up zero problems that we experience.p  pI was wondering p  ul liHas anyone experienced this before If so what did you do to fixworkaround the problemli liDoes anyone have any suggestions as to whether the original author of the document is correct and what I can do to test the theoryli ul  pUnfortunately I cant post code as the serial code is tightly couple with the rest of the system, though if you have questions regarding it I can answer questions about it. p  pstrongUpdatesstrongp  ul liThe code is written using Win32 Comm routines  so I am using CreateFile, ReadFile.

Negative 8722 pIm having a right barney getting my head around how everything fits together using the MVVM pattern.

Sometimes I have to display two views on the page at the same time sometimes I switch back to a single view.  In my normal Flex brain I would have a main view with a codebehind which contained all my other views equally with codebehinds. That main view would then do the switching of the other individual views.p  pWhen I try to implement this in MVVM Im trying to stick to the principles of MVVM by using binding which decouples my codeViewscode from the codeViewModelscode.  Lets say I create a codeViewModelcode for applicationwide state and my codeApplicationViewcode binds to that data and does all the switching of the sub views.  p  pNow, where should I create my view models for my subviews Ive tried inside the codeApplicationViewcode  that didnt seem right.  And then Ive tried outside of the application view and passing and instance of it into the codeApplicationViewcode and then my sub models a bind to it. Am I missing something None of these methods seem to fit the whole point of trying to decouple this.p  pAny good books or links that explain this problem would be much appreciated.p  pCheers, Jamesp

Negative 8722 pI recently wrote a nodebased stack class, per instructions specs in the comments before the code, taken from the forum post. I was told to post it here for review by one of the friendlier members of the SO community, so here it is. For simplicitys sake I put the definitions with the implementation. I understand when to use header files  p  pMainly, I want to know if my use of delete is sound. I am still unsure of myself when it comes to using destructors the specs made it sound like the ONLY time I should be deleting nodes should be during pop, and anything else is unsafe. I also dont understand the use of a copy constructorassignment constructor here.p  pAnyways, any bugs or comments about the code would be great. p  precodestack class  Background the specs for this are, verbatim   Write a nodebased stack class smile.gif  The stack is one of the most fundamental data structures used in computer science.  A stack has three basic operations  pushvalue  puts a value on the top of the stack pop  removes and returns the value thats on the top of the stack peek  return but does not remove the value off the top of the stack  Before creating the stack, you first have to create a Node class, which is a  very basic class with just two member variables the value of the node, and a  pointer to the previous node in the stack.  Your stack should have only one member variable the top node of the stack.  When you push, you add a node with the new value, with its previous pointer  pointing towards the current stack top item. When you pop, you delete the top  node and then set the top of the stack to whatever that nodes previous node  pointer was.  push, pop, and peek must all run in constant time.

Negative 8722 pI have a reasonably complex Core Data app for the the iPhone.  For the most part, its working well, but Im running into a sporadic problem that manifests itself within Core Data.p  pIm fetching data from a remote service, said service returns data.  I parse the data and modify various managed objects.  Then I save the managed object context and I get an error.  In the course of printing the error I get the following messagebr emem [UIImage length] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x8cd7aa0p  pI can isolate the problem down to a single setter in my one of my managed objects.  I save the managed object context before using the setting and I save the managed object context right after.  Failure happens right after.p  pThis is all being done in the main thread.  I have more than one managed object context, but only one persistent store.p  pAny pointers for debugging this sort of Core Data problem are appreciated.p

Negative 8722 pI have a problem with a TextBox in an application...p  pA window has a Grid with two columns. The left column contains a control with a constant width but with a height that adapts. The right column contains a TextBox that takes up all remaining space in the Grid and thereby in the Window. p  pThe Grid is given a minimal width and height and is wrapped within a ScrollViewer. If the user resizes the window to be smaller than the minimal widhtheight of the Grid, scrollbars are displayed.p  pThis is exactly how I want it to be. However, a problem occurs when the user starts typing text. If the text is to long to fit in one line in the TextBox, I want the text to wrap. Therefore I set TextWrappingWrap on the TextBox. But since the TextBox has an automatic width and is wrapped in a ScrollViewer  its actually the whole Grid that is wrapped, the TextBox just keeps expanding to the right.p  pI do want the TextBox to expand if the window is expanded, but I dont want the TextBox to expand by the text. Rather the text should wrap inside the available TextBox. If the text dont fit within the TextBox height, a scrollbar should be displayed within the TextBox.p  pIs there a way to accomplish thisp  pBelow is some code that shows my problem.p  precodeltWindow xClassAdaptingTextBoxes.MainWindow     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     TitleMainWindow Height300 Width400 BackgroundDarkCyangt ltGrid Margin10 NameLayoutRootgt     ltScrollViewer HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityAuto VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt         ltGrid MinWidth300 MinHeight200gt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltColumnDefinition Widthauto gt                 ltColumnDefinition Width gt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt              ltButton Grid.Column0 Margin0,0,10,0 ContentButton Width100 gt              ltTextBox Grid.Column1 AcceptsReturnTrue TextWrappingWrap ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityDisabled ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto gt         ltGridgt     ltScrollViewergt ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre

Negative 8722 pI have a large C code base. It seems quite buggy at times, and I was wondering if there is a quick way to improve finding and diagnosing issues that are occuring on client PCs.p  pThe most pressing issue is that exceptions occur in the software, are caught, and even reported through to me. The problem is that by the time they are caught the original cause of the exception is lost.p  pI.e. If an exception was caught in a specific method, but that method calls 20 other methods, and those methods each call 20 other methods. You get the picture, a null reference exception is impossible to figure out, especially if it occured on a client machine.p  pI have currently found some places where I think errors are more likely to occur and wrapped these directly in their own try catch blocks. Is that the only solution I could be here a long time.p  pI dont care that the exception will bring down the current process it is just a thread anyway  not the main application, but I care that the exceptions come back and dont help with troubleshooting.p  pAny ideasp  pI am well aware that I am probably asking a question which sounds silly, and may not have a straightforward answer. All the same some discussion would be good.p

Negative 8722 pI developed a generic Unsigned class, or really a class template codeUnsignedltsizet Ngtcode that models after the C C builtin unsigneds using the amount of codeuint8tcodes as a parameter. For example codeUnsignedlt4gtcode is identical to a codeuint32tcode and codeUnsignedlt32gtcode would be identical to a codeuint256tcode  if it existed.p  pSo far I have managed to follow most if not all of the semantics expected from a builtin unsigned  in particular codesizeofNaturalltNgtNcode, codeNaturalltNgt1  maxvalueallbits1  NaturalltNgt0code,  compatibility with abs, sign, div using a custom divt structure, ilogb exclusive to GCC it seems and numericlimitslt.p  pHowever Im facing the issue that, since 1. a class template is just a template so templated forms are unrelated, and 2. the template nontyped parameter requires a compiletime constant, which is way stricter than a codeconstcode, Im essentially unable to strongcreate a Unsigned given an unknown Nstrong.p  pIn other words, I cant have code like thisp  precode...  ... assuming all adequate headers are included ... using namespace std using lppUnsigned stdstring str coutltlt Enter an arbitrarily long integer end it with ltENTERgt gt getlinecin, str, n  const int digits10  log10str.length  1  const int digits256  digits10  1  ceillog10log256  from 1010D  256T  at this point, I should be able to, semantically, do this Unsignedltdigits256gt num  lt THIS I CANT  num would be guaranteed                            big enough to hold strs binary expression,                            no more space is needed Unsignedfromstrnum, str  somehow converts essentially a base change algo  now I could do whatever I wanted with num as if a builtin. stdstring strb3  changebasenum, 3  a generic implemented somehow coutltlt The number above, in base 3, is ltlt strb3ltlt endl ... codepre  pAN  This is part of the testsuite for Unsigned, which reads a slightly large number I have tried up to 120 digits  after setting N accordingly and does things like expressing it in other bases, which in and of itself tests all arithmethic functions already.p  pIn looking for possible ways to bypass or otherwise alleviate this limitation, I have been running into some concepts that Id like to try and explore, but I wouldnt like to spend too much effort into an alternative that is only going to make things more complicated or that would make the behaviour of the classes deviate too much.p  pThe first thing I thought was that if I wasnt able to pick up a codeUnsignedltNgtcode of my choice, I could at least pick up from a set of preselected values of N which would lead to the adequate constructor being called at runtime, but depending on a compiletime valuep  precode GetMeAnUnsigned sizet S    switch S      case 0  throw something    we cant have a zerosize number, right     case 1, 2, 3, 4  return Unsignedlt4gt break      case 5, 6, 7, 8  return Unsignedlt8gt break      case 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16  return Unsignedlt16gt break      ....     default  return Unsignedlt128gt break   wow, a 1Kib number       end switch   exit1  this point shouldnt be reachable     end function codepre  pI personally like the approach. However I dont know what can I use to specify the return type. It doesnt actually solve the problem, it only degrades its severity by a certain degree. Im sure doing the trick with the switch would work since the instantiations emareem from compiletime constant, it only changes emwhichem of them will take place. p  pThe only viable help to declare the return type seems to be this new C01X emdecltypeem construct which would allow me to obtain the adequate type, something like, if I understood the feature correctlyp  precodedecltype UnsignedltNgt GetMeAnUnsigned sizet S    .. do some choices that originate an N   return UnsignedltNgt    codepre  p... or something like that. I havent entered into CX beyond codeautocode for iterators yet, so the first question would be emwould features like codedecltypecode or codeautocode help me to achieve what I wantem emRuntimeem selection of the instantiation, even if limitedp  pFor an alternative, I was thinking that if the problem was the relation between my classes then I could make them emallem a kindof Base by deriving the template itselfp  precodetemplate ltsizet Ngt class Unsigned  private UnsignedCommon  ... codepre  p... but I left that approach in the backburner because, well, one doesnt do emthatem make all a kindof with builtins, plus for the cases where one emdoesem actually treat them as a common class it requires initializing statics, returning pointers and leave the client to destruct if I recall correctly. Second question then emdid I do wrong in discarding this alternative too earlyemp

Then the lists seem to get confused as to which one should be receiving the item thats being dragged, meaning you get a bunch of jittering happening as it appearsdisappears in each list.p  pIt looks like the issue is that both lists are handling the mousesort events since the item being dragged is technically over both lists, but what I want is to have the overlayed list i.e. the codeposition fixedcode one swallow the events so that the underlying main list doesnt try to receive the item.p  pHeres the minimal code examplep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.4.3jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.6jqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltstyle typetextcssgt         ul  liststyletype none padding 0 float left          li  margin 5px padding 5px width 500px border solid 1px F00 backgroundcolor FFF          overlayed  position fixed top 0 backgroundcolor 000 margin 20px padding 10px          overlayed li  width 50px float left      ltstylegt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         function              ul.sortable connectWith ul, opacity 0.6 .disableSelection              ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idoverlayedgt      ltulgt         ltligtItem Xltligt         ltligtItem Yltligt         ltligtItem Zltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt ltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgt ltulgt     ltligtItem 01ltligt     ltligtItem 02ltligt     ltligtItem 03ltligt     ltligtItem 04ltligt     ltligtItem 05ltligt     ltligtItem 06ltligt     ltligtItem 07ltligt     ltligtItem 08ltligt     ltligtItem 09ltligt     ltligtItem 10ltligt     ltligtItem 11ltligt     ltligtItem 12ltligt     ltligtItem 13ltligt     ltligtItem 14ltligt     ltligtItem 15ltligt     ltligtItem 16ltligt     ltligtItem 17ltligt     ltligtItem 18ltligt     ltligtItem 19ltligt     ltligtItem 20ltligt     ltligtItem 21ltligt     ltligtItem 22ltligt     ltligtItem 23ltligt     ltligtItem 24ltligt     ltligtItem 25ltligt     ltligtItem 26ltligt     ltligtItem 27ltligt     ltligtItem 28ltligt     ltligtItem 29ltligt     ltligtItem 30ltligt ltulgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo the question is, how do I fix itp
Negative 8722 pIve made my own class which extends AbstractTableModel. The idea is to be able to store a hidden id collumn.

Negative 8722 pOk, this is a weird one. Ive created a simple sample site to demonstrate the issue.

If I run this in Cassini, it all works fine. However when I run this in IIS, this is what happens. When I run the site atp  precodehttpmysamplesite.dev codepre  pand then click on the button, nothing happens. The page just reloads, but my event handler for the button never gets called, and subsequently the label text never gets updated. However if I then run it atp  precodehttpmysamplesite.devDefault.aspx codepre  pand then click the button, it works fine and my event handler does get called p  pAfter digging around some I changed the code in the module to thisp  precodestring text  queryStringParam  var value  context.Request.QueryString[text] var boolValue  value  null codepre  pNotice, here Im accessing the QueryString property directly, and not going to context.Request. When I changed it to this, it works fine regardless of whether or not I had Default.aspx in the urlp  pNext step I did was, I looked at Reflector to see what the code of the HttpRequest indexer property actually doesp  precodepublic string this[string key]      get              string str  this.QueryString[key]         if str  null                      return str                  str  this.Form[key]         if str  null                      return str                  HttpCookie cookie  this.Cookies[key]         if cookie  null                      return cookie.Value                  str  this.ServerVariables[key]         if str  null                      return str                  return null       codepre  pSeems harmless enough, it just checks various collections for me, so I dont need to check each one individually. So then Im wondering, which one of those calls breaks it. I then changed my module to thisp  precodestring text  queryStringParam  var value  context.Request.QueryString[text] var boolValue  value  null  var value2  context.Request.Form[text] var boolValue2  value2  null codepre  pAnd now its broken again So to make a long story short, just by strongaccessingstrong the Form collection on the request in the IHttpModule, I somehow screw up the PostBack, and the event never gets fired. p  pDoes anyone have any idea why this is happening Im more of an ASP.Net MVC guy, I dont know ASP.Net and all the shtick it pulls behind the scenes well enough to really have a clue as to why this is happening. p

When I store the image in the database, no matter what size image above 30kb that I put in, only part of the image is saved.p  pI checked the data stored in the database and all images have the same amount of data stored so my guess is that something is limiting the size of the byte[] that can be held in the column.p  pWhen I pull the data out of the database and display the image on the screen, it shows the top portion of the image only.p  pWhat could be wrongp  pstrongUpdatestrong I checked the size of the data in the varbinarymax column and all data entries are 8000bytes.p  pHeres the codep  pTable Creationp  precodeIF NOT EXISTSSELECT  FROM INFORMATIONSCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLENAME LIKE Image             CREATE TABLE [Image]                              [ImageId]                       INT IDENTITY1,1       NOT NULL,                 [FileName]                      NVARCHARMAX           NOT NULL,                 [ImageData]                     VARBINARYMAX          NOT NULL,                 [Caption]                       NVARCHARMAX           NULL,                 CONSTRAINT PKImageId PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ImageId ASC                 ON [PRIMARY]              codepre  pFluent mappingp  precodepublic ImageMap              Idxgtx.Id,ImageId.GeneratedBy.Identity         Mapx gt x.Caption         Mapx gt x.FileName         Mapx gt x.Data.ColumnImageData         HasManyx gt x.ArticleImages.KeyColumnImageId.Inverse         HasOnex gt x.Thumbnail.PropertyRefrgtr.Image.Cascade.All      codepre  pNHibernate entity classp  precodeusing System.Collections.Generic   public class Image  BaseEntity       ltsummarygt      Images name      ltsummarygt     public virtual string FileName  get set        ltsummarygt      Images Caption      ltsummarygt     public virtual string Caption  get set        ltsummarygt      Binary data for the image      ltsummarygt     public virtual byte[] Data  get set        ltsummarygt      Link to article      ltsummarygt     public virtual IEnumerableltArticleImagegt ArticleImages  get set        ltsummarygt      The thumbnail for the image      ltsummarygt     public virtual ImageThumbnail Thumbnail  get set   codepre

Negative 8722 pIm working on a research project that requires me to process large csv files 25 GB with 500,000 records.  These files contain information on government contracts from a hrefhttpwww.usaspending.gov relnofollowUSASpending.gova.  So far, Ive been using PHP or Python scripts to attack the files rowbyrow, parse them, and then insert the information into the relevant tables.  The parsing is moderately complex.  For each record, the script checks to see if the entity named is already in the database using a combination of string and regex matching if it is not, it first adds the entity to a table of entities and then proceeds to parse the rest of the record and inserts the information into the appropriate tables.  The list of entities is over 100,000.p  pHere are the basic functions part of a class that try to match each record with any existing entitiesp  precodeprivate function getOrgdata       if name of organization is null, skip it     ifdata[44]   return null       use each of the possible names to check if organization exists     names  arraydata[44],data[45],data[46],data[47]       cycle through the names     foreachnames as name           check to see if there is actually an entry here         ifname                iforgid  thisgtparseOrgname  null                  thisgtupdateorgmetaorgid,data  updates some information of existing entity based on record                 return orgid                                 return thisgtaddOrgdata   private function parseOrgname       check to see if it matches any org names      db class function, performs simple like match     thisgtdbgtwhereorgname,name,like      result  thisgtdbgtgetorgs      ifmysqlnumrowsresult  1          row  mysqlfetchobjectresult         return rowgtorgid            check to see if matches any org aliases     thisgtdbgtwhereorgaliasname,name,like      result  thisgtdbgtgetorgsaliases      ifmysqlnumrowsresult  1          row  mysqlfetchobjectresult         return rowgtorgid          return null  no matches, have to add new entity   codepre  pThe addOrg function inserts the new entitys information into the db, where hopefully it will match subsequent records.p  pHeres the problem I can only get these scripts to parse about 10,000 records  hour, which, given the size, means a few solid days for each file.  The way my db is structured requires a several different tables to be updated for each record because Im compiling multiple external datasets.  So, each record updates two tables, and each new entity updates three tables.  Im worried that this adds too much lag time between MySQL server and my script.p  pHeres my question is there a way to import the text file into a temporary MySQL table and then use internal MySQL functions or PHPPython wrapper to strongspeed upstrong the processingp  pIm running this on my Mac OS 10.6 with local MySQL server.p

Negative 8722 pIm working on a project that involves creating a spline from a defined set of points tens of thousands of points.p  pI first create a spline for the first 1000 points and simulate driving on that path with an arrow it is drawn using the tangent and the current point on spline. When Im approaching the end of the path I take the next 1000 points and create a new spline and continue my driving. p  pThe problem that I have is the fact that the splines previous spline and current spline dont match at the end. By not matching I mean they dont have the same tangent first derivative doesnt match and there is a difference between the last point of the previous spline and first point on the new spline this is because Im not using an interpolating spline but a smooth spline  see NOTE1 below. This makes my arrow jump at the end of spline, when switching to the newly created spline.p  pemNOTE1em Im strongNOTstrong using interpolating splines. Im using smooth splines. See a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwaregslmanualhtmlnodeBasisSplines.html relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSmoothingspline relnofollowherea for more details. This means that the set of points given as input may not be on the resulting spline In my case they are quite close to the spline  but usually strongNOTstrong on the spline.p  pemNOTE2em Using an interpolating spline is out of the question because I have a lot of noise in the data used for computing spline.p  pemNOTE3em Computing a spline for the entire set of points takes a lot of time more than 30 seconds on a 3Ghz PC with 2 GB RAM our target platform for the application so doing this is also out of the question.p  pId be interested to overcome that unwanted jump when switching splines.p  pSo my questions arep  ul liAre there some waysalgorithms for doing a smooth jumptransition to the new splineli liCan I do something with a special type of spline to overcome this This is what I tried so far without a considerable improvement.li ul  pThank you for any ideas,p  pIulianp

The codeasynccode monad allows you to use codeletcode which will start the computation of the given async method, and suspend the thread, untill the result is available.. thats all fine, I do understand that.p  pNow what I dont understand is why they made an extension for the codeWebClientcode class, thats named codeAsyncDownloadStringcode  Couldnt you just wrap the normal codeDownloadStringcode inside an async block Im pretty sure, Im missing an important point here, since Ive done some testing that shows DownloadString wrapped inside an async block, still blocks the thread.p

Negative 8722 pI am working on a Java program that requires to check the existence of files.p  pWell, simple enough, the code make use calls to File.exists for checking file existence. And the problem I have is, it reports false positive. That means the file does not actually exist but exists method returns true. No exception was captured at least no exception like Stale NFS handle. The program even managed to read the file through InputStream, getting 0 bytes as expected and yet no exception. The target directory is a Linux NFS. And I am 100 sure that the file being looked for never exists.p  pI know there are known bugs kind of API limitation exist for java.io.File.exists. So Ive then added another way round by checking file existence using Linux command ls. Instead of making call to File.exists the Java code now runs a Linux command to ls the target file. If exit code is 0, file exists. Otherwise, file does not exist.p  pThe number of times the issue is hit seems to be reduced with the introduction of the trick, but still pops. Again, no error was captured anywhere stdout this time. That means the problem is so serious that even native Linux command wont fix for 100 of the time.p  pSo there are couple of questions aroundp  ol liI believe Javas well known issue on File.exists is about reporting false negative. Where file was reported to not exist but in fact does exist. As the API does not throws IOException for File.exists, it choose to swallow the Exception in the case calls to OSs underlying native functions failed e.g. NFS timeout. But then this does not explain the false positive case I am having, given that the file never exist. Any throw on this oneli liMy understanding on Linux ls exit code is, 0 means okay, equivalent to file exists. Is this understanding wrong The man page of ls is not so clear on explaining the meaning of exit code Exit status is 0 if OK, 1 if minor problems, 2 if serious trouble.li liAll right, back to subject. Any surefire way to check File existence with Java on Linux Before we see JDK7 with NIO2 officially released.li ol  pThanks p
Negative 8722 pI made a mysql table with a column called uid that is a primary key but not an auto increment. This is because Im using a php rand00000000,99999999 or whatever to fill the uid with. It worked for a while until I tried to delete rows in the table. They wouldnt delete in phpmyadmin unless I checked them off and used the delete X at the bottom. The X on the same row as the record wouldnt do anything. So... when I finally had them deleted, I tried some more INSERTs from my php script, and now the uids are the same ones that they were before even though the random number being inserted in is different. So, I figured well i guess i dont need to make uid a primary key, so I removed that, and I just have a normal column called uid. But the problem persists. I tried to flush the mysql table. and I tried dropping the table and recreating it to no avail. Any ideas would be very helpful. Thanks.p  pHeres the table with some columns removedp  precodeCREATE TABLE members     uid int13 NOT NULL,    emailAddress varchar150 NOT NULL,  emailAddressVerified tinyint1 NOT NULL default 0,  agreesToTerms varchar5 NOT NULL,  timestampJoined timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENTTIMESTAMP,   PRIMARY KEY  uid  ENGINEMyISAM DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1 codepre
Negative 8722 pI have a design where I need to swap in and out two tableviews using one viewcontroller I need the same navigation title to appear for both. So Ive created each tableview in its own subclassed tableviewcontroller class, then Ive included a class variable for each in my viewcontroller. Each tableview has the viewcontroller as a parent and calls the viewcontrollers swap method when a swap needs to occur. This method and the viewDidLoad method is listed belowp  precode void viewDidLoad       [super viewDidLoad]      [[self navigationItem] setTitle AddAPhotoViewControllerTitle]      SelectAnAlbumTableViewController selectAnAlbumTableViewControllerTemp  [[SelectAnAlbumTableViewController alloc] initWithParent self]     [self setSelectAnAlbumTableViewController selectAnAlbumTableViewControllerTemp]     [selectAnAlbumTableViewControllerTemp release]      [[self view] insertSubview [[self selectAnAlbumTableViewController] tableView] atIndex 0]    void switchTableViews      if [[[self selectAnAlbumTableViewController] tableView] superview]  nil                [[self view] insertSubview [[self selectAnAlbumTableViewController] tableView] atIndex 0]                [[[self selectAPhotoTableViewController] tableView] removeFromSuperview]              [selectAPhotoTableViewController release]              selectAPhotoTableViewController  nil          else               SelectAPhotoTableViewController selectAPhotoTableViewControllerTemp  [[SelectAPhotoTableViewController alloc] initWithAssetGroup [[self selectAnAlbumTableViewController] assetGroup] parent self]         [self setSelectAPhotoTableViewController selectAPhotoTableViewControllerTemp]         [selectAPhotoTableViewControllerTemp release]          [[self view] insertSubview [[self selectAPhotoTableViewController] tableView] atIndex 0]              [[[self selectAnAlbumTableViewController] tableView] removeFromSuperview]       codepre  pI have 2 questionsp  p1 When Im doing the swap, Im inserting the new tableview, animating the transition I didnt include the animation code to keep it concise, then removing the old tableview from the superview. Is this the correct order  correct way to do this It works fine, but Im wondering if there isnt some code smell here.p  p2 Using this design pattern, what would be the best way to go about putting in an activity indicator that can be displayed while each tableview is loading Ive tried implementing the indicator in the viewcontroller, and it seemed to work ok, but I wasnt sure how to set its position In terms of what The center of I guess this goes back to the first question I asked to, what is the superview and when, or if there is even a superviewp

Negative 8722 pBefore I begin, Id like to say that the database structure is set and is not able to be changed. I have to work with the structure that Im provided. So please dont suggest I change the database. p  pI have this database for an online game. This game has a skill tree, where each skill has prerequisite skills that you must obtain to unlock it. Each prereq skill might have its own prereq skills, and so on. Depth is not fixed, it can go 6 or 7 levels deep.p  pSo, lets say I have this skill tree, which is required to fire torpedoesp  precodeTorpedos  Missile Launcher Operation   Heavy Missiles     Standard Missiles codepre  pit also includes some redundant prerews, like Standard Missiles require Missile Launcher Operation. Those left out for simplicityp  pDue to the nature of the database, I was thinking about making a stored procedure that recurses through the skill tree. Every skill has an ID associated with it and a number of prereqs no parents tho. This is my current SQL queryp  precodeSELECT IFNULLSkillName.valueInt,SkillName.valueFloat AS SkillID, items.typeName AS Skill FROM dgmtypeattributes AS SkillName INNER JOIN dgmtypeattributes AS SkillLevel ON SkillLevel.typeID  SkillName.typeID AND SkillLevel.attributeID IN 277, 278, 279, 1286, 1287, 1288 INNER JOIN invtypes  AS items ON IFNULLSkillName.valueInt,SkillName.valueFloat  items.typeID WHERE SkillName.typeID  SKILLID AND SkillName.attributeID  182 AND SkillLevel.attributeID  277 OR SkillName.attributeID  183 AND SkillLevel.attributeID  278 OR SkillName.attributeID  184 AND SkillLevel.attributeID  279 OR SkillName.attributeID  1285 AND SkillLevel.attributeID  1286 OR SkillName.attributeID  1289 AND SkillLevel.attributeID  1287 OR SkillName.attributeID  1290 AND SkillLevel.attributeID  1288 codepre  pDont worry about the fluff, the main thing here is the SKILLID. If I were to put 3325 the ID for Torpedoes in place of SKILLID, it would returnp  precode  SkillID  Skill                            3319  Missile Launcher Operation      3324  Heavy Missiles               codepre  pIf I were to put in 3324 ID for heavy missiles, it would returnp  precode  SkillID  Skill                            3321  Standard Missiles            codepre  pSo, basically, I need to loop through these queries and use the SkillIDs from the previous results in the new query, eventually coming to an end. I will also need a new column, codeparentcode, to designate which skillID is the parent for the row.p  pProblem is, I have no idea what Im doing when it comes to stored procedures. Ive read up on them and I still dont know how to go about doing this.p  pI can easily do this with PHP and a few SQL queries, but I wanted to try my hand at procedures for a change of pace.

Negative 8722 pFor those distributing Mac apps outside the Mac App Store, how are you planning to support updating and sandboxing Im guessing most peoples answers for the time being is that theyre not, but I hope that eventually nonMAS apps could be sandboxed just like MAS apps.p  pTo use Sparkle, your app would need network access, which could be granted, as well as the ability to overwrite itself in Applications. Currently you could do this with the com.apple.security.temporaryexception.files.absolutepath.readwrite entitlement, but thats not a good solution. It will likely go away, and even if it doesnt theres little point in sandboxing an app if youre going to give it full filesystem readwrite access as well as network access.p  pHas anyone already gone down this path and found a good solution I ask because I try to keep my MAS build and my nonMAS build as identical as possible, and Im currently looking at having my MAS build sandboxed and my nonMAS build not.p

Negative 8722 pThis question is about a proper architecture using JSP as a controller for ExtJS.p  pI am fairly new to server side development but I am pretty familiar with ExtJS 4 and getting better with Java and SQL daily.p  pI am trying to create a JSP controller to emwriteem the data from stores in ExtJS. I have MSSQL database and Tomcat running on the server. p  pI successfully created a JSP sqlData.jsp that reads from the database and returns JSON data. I pass a query name to this JSP, it then looks up what the query is from a query table columns code[queryid],[queryname],[query]code. It then runs the query and returns the data in a JSON format  this is working fine to get data into ExtJS from a database. p  pTo use this backend setup I usually configure the store like thisp  precodevar store  Ext.createExt.data.Store,      model aModel,     proxy          type ajax,         url sqlData.jspqueryNameaQueryName,         reader json     ,     autoLoad true  codepre  pSomehow, I need this sqlData.jsp to also handle a codestore.savecode call from the ExtJS framework. Which means the JSP needs to receive a POST request and then do an update based on a pile of JSON data ExtJS sends read request as GET and write methods like codestore.savecode are POST.p  pMy plan was to add something in the Java to recognize whether it is a POST or GET request. Then, if it is a POST request, I would send it to a different Java method in the JSP to parse the JSON and write it to the database. p  pOf course I would have to change my query table to have another column for updateinsert statements linked to the same queryName i.e. code[queryid],[queryname],[selectquery],[updatequery]code.p  pDoes this backend implementation make any sense p  pAnyone else use JSP and ExtJS to achieve this smootherp  pI noticed that there is an codeapicode config option I can set in my proxy to specify different URLs for the different operations READ, WRITE, DELETE, etc. Should I make a separate JSP and direct all write requests using this config insteadp  pWould it be wiser to add a codewriter jsoncode config on the proxy so that it parses embeforeem POSTING I figured I would have to parse it in the JSP either way so I didnt think I should.p  pAny pointers will be much appreciated.p

The second type I click it Ive already stated that dataURL is what it is and img.src sees it as that...p  pHow do I fix thisp  pMy main goal however is saving this dataURL to a database Ive attempted to use an ajax with the get method but the problem here is dataURL contains so many characters that cause issue with get.p  pIs there a special way I can encode the dataURL and make it getajax friendly so I can save it to my databasep  pThank you very muchp

Negative 8722 pI have a VS11 beta WPF application with a Microsoft Datagrid based on a table from an Entity Framework 5.0b2 model from an sql server database.  The grid uses whatever code was autogenerated by adding a data source from an entity framework model and dragging and dropping a table from that model to the design surface..  I then used the EF5.0 DBContext code generator addin to generate DbContext types that I could use in the app.  p  pThe result was not good.  I got a compile error that seems unfixable at least my attempts made things worse.  The datagrid does not like DbContext and doesnt coexist with it when both the datagrid and DbContext are based on the same database and tables.  Is there a workaround, maybe by changing the code generator templatep  pThe error message is pasted at the end.  Thanks for any help or insight on this. p  pnote the following closely related post isnt an answer because though I can convert dbcontext to objectcontext, I cant get datagrid to work properly with it when I do and if I convert objectcontext to dbcontext, I dont have the autogenerated dbcontext types  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8059900convertdbcontexttoobjectcontextforusewithgridviewConvert DBContext to ObjectContext for use with GridViewa. Im looking for a fairly simple workaroundIm sure theres a workaround if I start hand coding all types and conversions, but I want to keep the ease of using the autogenerated codeI dont want to be occupied with work the code generator can, and so should, do.

Negative 8722 pWe are utilizing Adobe FMS 4.5 to record video from users webcam.  We are not livebroadcasting this video, we just want to capture it and save it on the server to do things with it later attach to users account, show as inpage content, etc.p  pWeve written a robust capture application that streams up to the server, unpublishes correctly, and allows the user to view the video after its finished unpublishing, etc.  This does seem to work, in that it saves video files as we expect.p  pThe problem is that those recorded videos seem to have a small gap at the beginning.  Its considerably less than one second.  Were talking maybe 5100s to 110th of a second that has no video data.  It really looks like there is no video keyframe at the very beginning of the video.p  pNow, this wouldnt normally be an issue  the video just begins a bit into the playback, and plays fine in most players.  Problem is, were allowing the users to trim videos arbitrarily later on with a different tool  a custom visual interface to FFmpeg.  If they begin a video trim before that first keyframe theres an ugly grey mess in the final output because there is no visual data in the area where FFmpeg started cutting.p  pMy first thought was, Oh, I must need to attach the camera differently  at a different point  on some callback  etc.  I played around with attaching the camera before calling publish, after NetStream.Publish.Start, etc, etc.p  pAm I missing something intrinsic, here  Or am I just working with the wrong idea, or do I misunderstand the processp  pOf course, the answer I completely expect, but dont want is, Thats just how FMS does it.   We could add a serverside process to remove the first XX bit of video, but its arbitrary we dont know how much to trim, and we dont want to risk losing any user data.p  pHeres a generalization of the code we usedp  precodeprivate function initvoid      var myerrorsArray  []      if  Camera.isSupported               myerrors.push camera is not supported           else              camera  Camera.getCamera         if  camera                       myerrors.push no camera found                   else if  camera.muted                       Security.showSettings SecurityPanel.PRIVACY                     mic  Microphone.getMicrophone     if  mic               myerrors.push no microphone found            if  myerrors.length               this.fatalerror myerrors          return           camera.setMode camerawidth, cameraheight, camerafps, true      camera.setQuality 0, cameraquality       netconnect  new NetConnection     netconnect.addEventListener NetStatusEvent.NETSTATUS, netstatushandler      netconnect.connect publishurl   private function netstatushandler evNetStatusEvent void      switch  ev.info.code               case NetConnection.Connect.Success             trace CONNECT Connected to   publishurl                beginstream         break       private function beginstreamvoid      if  this.recording          return     this.recording  true      guid  GUID.create      netstream  new NetStream netconnect      netstream.addEventListener NetStatusEvent.NETSTATUS, netstreamhandler      netstream.attachCamera camera      netstream.attachAudio mic      netstream.publish guid, record   codepre

Negative 8722 pI need to create several objects that have often circular references to each other. In general, several objects might be involved, but heres one simple case where I need just a pair of cars that refer to each otherp  precodeclass Car   def initself, position, speed     self.position  position     self.speed  speed   def setreferenceself, othercar     self.othercar  othercar    ...   def main    ...   car1  Carpos1, spd1   car2  Carpos2, spd2   car1.setreferencecar2   car2.setreferencecar1 codepre  pA car without a reference to the other car is not a valid object. So ideally, Id like to perform codesetreferencecode from inside the codeinitcode method this would be both safer no chance of using invalid objects and cleaner all initialization will be performed in codeinitcode as one might expect. p  pIs there any neat solution that achieves this goal I dont mind creating a pair of cars at once, but each car is a standalone entity, and so it needs to be an instance in its own right.p  pIm also aware that circular references are troublesome for GC Ill deal with that.p  pUse casep  pEach car serves as a backup for the other. Car instances are smart, i.e., they can do a lot of work. Its annoying if the a car instance doesnt know its backup, since it prevents a car from completing actions without requiring a reference from outside every time.p

The value 1234 being passed in is retrieved by the C code correctly now. This has exposed another issue in the C DLL. The 1234 value is not available to the C code. Instead the object has a value of 0 inside the DLL. I would like to use predefined C functions to edit the object from within the DLL. Any more help is greatly appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 8722 pI have circular sprites and I need to check to see if they collide with any other circle.

Negative 8722 pOS  FreeBSD 8.2 on Oracle VM Virtual Boxp  pI am trying to test that a process attempting to acquire a read lock will be blocked until it is able to acquire it. After initializing coderwlockcode in Process 1 and locking the lock as a writer I create a second process which attempts to acquire the lock as a reader using blocking coderwrlockcode. What I am shooting for is for process 2 to be blocked until process 1 releases Write lock so I am attempting to use pause to insure that process 2 has enough time to be scheduled. However this same pause somehow crashes the system in this scenario since if it is removed the program runs fine. If I replace the pause with a busy loop in Process 1, Process 2 does not get scheduled until Process 1 finishes so it ruins the point of the test. codeDELAYcode also does not allow Process 2 to be scheduled.

Negative 8722 pIn Excel vba, I am creating two shapes in excel using vba. An arrow, which I name aro  i, and a textbox, which I name text  i, where i is a number indicating the number of a photograph.p  pSo, say for photograph 3 I will creat arrow aro3 and textbox text3.p  pI then want to group them and rename that group arotext  i, so arotext3 in this instance.p  pSo far I have been doing the grouping and renaming like thisp  precodetargetSheet.shapes.RangeArrayArrow.Name, textBox.Name.Select Selection.group Selection.Name  AroTxt amp Number codepre  pwhich works splendidly in a sub, but now I want to change this into a function and return the named group, so I tried something like thisp  precodeDim arrowBoxGroup as Object set arrowBoxGroup  targetSheet.shapes.RangeArrayArrow.Name, textBox.Name arrowBoxGroup.group arrowBoxGroup.Name  AroTxt amp Number codepre  pI run into problems when I create a new group which has the same name as one which has already been created. So, if I create a second aro3 and text3 and then try to group them and rename the group to arotext3 I get an error because a group with the same name is already present.p  pThe thing I dont understand is that when I did this using the method referring to the selection, I could rename every group with the same name if I wanted and wouldnt get an error. Why does it work when referring to the Selection object, but fails when trying to use an assigned objectp  pUPDATEp  pSince somebody asked, the code I have so far is below. arrow and textbox are an arrow and a textbox which point into a direction arbitrarily defined by the user using a form. p  pThis then creates an arrow at the correct angle on the target worksheet and places a textbox with the specified number also through the form at the end of the arrow, so that it effectively forms a callout. I know that there are callouts, but they dont do what I want so I had to make my own.p  pI have to group the textbox and arrow because 1 they belong together, 2 I keep track of which callouts have already been placed using the groups name as a reference, 3 the user has to place the callout in the right location on a map which is embedded in the worksheet.p  pSo far I have managed to make this into a function by making the return value a GroupObject. But this still relies on Sheet.Shapes.range.Select, which in my opinion is a very bad way of doing this. I am looking for a way which does not rely on the selection object.p  pAnd I would like to understand why this works when using selection, but fails when using strong typed variables to hold the objects.p  precode    Public Function MakeArrowByVal No As Integer, ByVal angle As Double, ByVal size As ArrowSize, ByVal ArrowX As Double, ByVal ArrowY As Double, ByVal TargetInternalAngle As Double,

Negative 8722 pIm wondering what the best way is to filter out various sections in a table view using a segmented control in a toolbar.  p  pLets say, for example, I have a table view with cells in 3 different sections  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I also have a toolbar on top of the view with 4 segments  All, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  When All is selected on the segmented control, all sections and cells in the table should be displayed.  When Friday is selected on the segmented control, only cells in the Friday section should be displayed in the table.  And so on and so forth...p  pWhere in the code for my table view controller can I make this happen  I imagine its a pretty simple thing to achieve, so are there any other examples of this that somebody can point me top  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 8722 pIve spent the last couple of days getting to grips with Sphinx in order to power the backend of an autocomplete feature.  Thanks to several SO users BarryHunter being the most helpful I now have a fully working setup complete with several indexes, delta indexers and more.p  pAll that is left is to decide on the automation method to run the delta reindexing and merging to the core indexes.p  pMy intention is to have the delta indexes updated every 5 minutes with the core indexesdelta indexes getting merged once every 24 hours.p  pMy understanding is that this in its most simple form this is achieved by setting up cron jobs.  However I have a real dislike for running cron jobs when I am not 100 confident of the amount of time they are going to take to complete.  The indexes are going to grow very quickly and would like to avoid being in a position of having to deal with the reindexing cron jobs overlapping an grinding everything to a halt.p  pFor this reason I have found myself considering gearman to manage to workload more effectively.p  pWhat I would like to know from any more experienced sphinx users particularly if they have run a similar setup using gearman is the followingp  ul liFor starters, is this a good ideali liIs this even necessary Are indexes in excess of 20 million rows going to take more than 5 minutes to completeli liHaving never used gearman before are there any pitfalls I should watch out forli liHow about using gearman for managing real time attribute changes In order to provide instant index deletion etc.  Worthwhileli ul  pSo really this is a general advice question rather than a specific one which I hope is allowed regarding this kind of setup.  I would rather ask here than spend the next 24 hours getting to grips with gearman only to find that it is not a good solution for managing sphinx indexes.p  pNOTE  I have been searching for information regarding this exact setup for the last hour and have turned up very little.  Hence the reason for my asking here on SO.p  pThanks in advance for any advice offered.p

Negative 8722 pIm building an Android app where the user has to touch a circle on the screen, and I need to record how far away the users touch was from the center of the circle.p  pThing is, I want to record the physical distance, not the pixel distance, because Im going to run this app on many devices and I want all the results to be uniform. For example, if the users touch distance from the center of the circle is 15px, this could be a physical distance of 0.5cm on one device, and 1cm on another just made up those numbers, but you get the idea. So I can only rely on physical measurements, not pixels.p  pSo how should I record the touch distances The codeView.onTouchEventcode method gives you the x and y of a touch event in pixels Im assuming, so do I just get the distance in pixels from the center of the circle to the touch, and then convert that to strongdpstrong and store all results in dp units Or should I convert the pixel distance to strongptstrong, which is supposed to be the same physical size on any device If so, how does one convert from px to pt I cant seem to find the answer to this anywherep

Negative 8722 pWhen creating custom UIView or UIScrollView subclasses for use with Core Text, how can we implement UITextPosition and UITextRange subclasses in discrete files of their own We need these to implement UITextInput, UITextInputTraits and UIKeyInput protocols as well. It seems these must be subclassed entirely within the .m or .mm file of the relevant view class that we use it in... when trying to do it in separate files, errors abound. Try separating the implementations out of the .m files in these sample projectsp  pApples SimpleTextInput sample code. Try removing the UITextPosition and UITextRange subclasses from the EditableCoreTextView.m file into their own discreet files...p  pTry the same with enormegos EGOTextView on Github.p  pif you dont see errors, try converting to iOS 6.0 and ARC.p

Negative 8722 pI have this issue. I have made a signup formular with a simple backendcontrolpanel in PHP. Travellers go to a page, where they sign up name, phonenumber, email, etc.. Then the signup is stored in a MySQL database. Whenever the controlpanel loads, then it gets all the information from the MySQL databse. Its a signup for different sportscamps, that takes place in different countries. So Im trying to make a Email the participants that signed up for destination Xmethod, which then somehow sends an email to all of the people, who signed up for destination X. Ive considered a couple of different ways to do it, but cant figure out, which is easier to make or better.p  p1 To make a SELECT theEmailAddress FROM tablename WHERE 1, that gets all the email addresses. Thereafter make a PHP mailfunction, for each of them. Then make a contactformular looking HTML form, that sends to each of those emails.     I just thought that this solution seem kinda clumsy, or whatp  p2 I have made a Mailchimpaccount. I was also considering to use Mailchimps API I havent used it and it seems kinda complex to make a button in the controlpanel, so a List is created for each destination. Then the message should be sent from Mailchimp. The massive upside about this way of doing it is, that there wouldnt be a struggle with spamfilters since Mailchimps emails rarely gets caught in the spamfilter.p  p3 Some other clever way of doing it, that I havent thought of yet. Im open for any kind of suggestion. p  pThank you.p

Negative 8722 pIs there a way to iterate through already open file descriptors opened by parent process and close them one by one in child process p  pOS Unix.p  pReason for closure RLIMITNOFILE limit of the setrlimit constrains the number of file descriptors that a process may allocate.If we want to restrict our child process by setting this limit, it depends on the already allocated file descriptors.p  pTrying to set this limit in a child process is restricted as the parent process has some open file descriptors and hence we cannot set this limit lesser than that number.p  pExample If parent process has 10 file descriptors allocated and we wish to limit the child process file descriptor number to less than 10 Say 3, we would need to close 7 file descriptors inside the child process.p  pThe solution to this can benefit all those who want to restrict their child process from creating new files or opening new network connections.p

That also works, however, the button sits on top of the Unity player as the Unity splash screen plays. p  pIs there any way to detect when the Unity splash screen exits so I dont have controls in place before the scene loadsp  pstrongUPDATE 31813strongp  pIve added a static boolean to my main activity in Eclipse to track splash screen completion and modified the code that adds the controls to watch the boolean.p  pMainActivity.javap  precodepublic static boolean splashComplete  false private View mControlViewContainer  null  initialized in onCreate  class QCARViewFinderTask extends TimerTask      public void run          MainActivity.this.runOnUiThreadnew Runnable              public void run                  if QCAR.isInitialized return wait for QCAR init search for QCAR view if it hasnt been found                 if mQCARView  null                                      View rootView  MainActivity.this.findViewByIdandroid.R.id.content                     QCARUnityPlayer qcarView  findQCARViewrootView                     if qcarView  null                          mQCARParentView  ViewGroupqcarView.getParent                         mQCARView  qcarView                                                                                add controls if QCAR view is located and the splash sequence is complete                 ifmQCARView  null  splashComplete  mControlViewContainer  null                     mQCARParentView.addViewmControlViewContainer                     mViewFinderTimer.cancel                     mViewFinderTimer  null                                              codepre  pIn Unity I created a simple script to set the static boolean in Java and attached it to the Vuforia ARCamerap  pSplashExit.jsp  precodefunction Start       var mainActivity  new AndroidJavaClass com.example.app.MainActivity     mainActivity.SetStatic.splashComplete,true  codepre  pThis works fairly well in a project with a simple scene. My controls seem to load on splash exit. When I use this method with a more complicated scene, however, the controls come up a second or so before the splash screen disappears.p  pIs there a better place to attach my Unity script, or a better method within the script, that will more accurately reflect when the splash sequence has exited Perhaps Jerdaks suggestion in the commentsp

Negative 8722 pI have measured a variable codexcode in equidistant long intervals every 10 min and a variable codeycode in nonequidistant short intervals somewhere between every 30 s and 90 s. Timestamps codedatenumcode for both codexcode and codeycode are available, but they are never equal, so codeintersectcode doesnt work. How can I aggregate codeycode e.g. codemeany...code in interval codexi1  xicode so I can compare the two e.g. plot them against each other or plot them with the same timevectorp  pedit 1 Confused codexcode and codeycode in my last but one sentence.p  pedit 2 I feel like I didnt give you enough information in the original question, sorry for that. Many of you suggest interpolation. codexcode is an average wind speed over a period of 10 minutes, not a distinct measurement. So if I say time  0710 and codex  3code ms, that means codemeanx  3code ms for the period from 0700 to 0710.  This is why I think its probably not the best idea to interpolate it. codeycode is one of many very noisy other variables and I want to find out the influence of mean codexcode on codeycode. So I would either like to assign many values of codeycode to one measurement of codexcode in that 10 minute period, or assign a codemeanycode to that one measurement of codexcode. I assume that the solutions are quite similar, code wise.p

Negative 8722 pI created the following code just now to help debug a C project we have to write that basically is eventually supposed to emulate a UNIX file system. Ive been pulling my hairs out trying to figure out why two seemingly identical blocks of code produce different output. When I simulate the same behavior that my function mkfs is supposed to have by typing the same lines of code in the main file, it works perfectly, but when I try to use the function literally the same lines of code, it simply says RUN FAILED. When I execute the code inside my main function that is currently commented out, it works great and indeed prints  to the console, but when I try to create a pointer to a filesystem, call mkfs on it, then print out the same string, it just doesnt work.p  pI must be not understanding something.

Negative 8722 pI am new to database design and Im trying to get into the best practices early. So far everywhere I look their seems to be an agreement that you Create the table names at the start of development, and insert your data, do emnotem use variables for table names. Well I was looking to make an asset management system and I cant get past what seems like a design flaw. This software would be very similar to quickbase if youre familiar.p  pHere is the scenario. p  ul liUser can create accounts, each account is in a table of accounts that has data inside that links back to the other related tables.li liInside each account there is as many catagories as they need to track info such as ul liFinancialsli liTripsli liTasks li lietcli ulli ul  pNow each one of these categories would hold a significant amount of information and would require its own table. Obviously I could use relationships to connect these tables back to the account but their is a problem I think. The user can create as many accounts as they need and every time they do their will need to be a number of other tables created along with it. Such as accountnamefinancialstable etc.p  pSo my question is Can this be possible to do without using variables for table names when dynamically creating them. emORem is this a scenario where it would be considered acceptable to use variables for table names when creating them. p  pIf this is too localized or vague please let me know and I will provide any further details needed. p  pThank you for your timep  pstrongEDITstrong p  pIn response to Davids awesome answer.p  pI fully understand now that each account is actually just an entry, or a row into one table that would hold the information for each account. The column names would then describe the data that describes my account and subsequently relates to the other tables. p  pNow the core of this problem is that when I create the account there are other tables that emneedem to be created, or at least I think they do. This would be a financials table for instance that holds specific information about that accounts financials. There is a one to one relationship on these tables. Meaning Account A can only have 1 set of financials for the specific account. So when I create Account B the financials table I currently have would no longer have relevant column names, rows, or data for Account B. So when I create these new tables for Account B, they would more then likely need to be done dynamically. With this being said, how would I create them without variable namesp  pOr perhaps Im still missing the point. A thought occurs to me that perhaps I could have one large financial table that holds information for all accounts and that information is definedrelated back to the specific account by id or some other unique fk pk identifierp

Negative 8722 pI have the following problem adding a codeHashMapltString,Stringgtcode to a codeTreeSetltHashMapltString,Stringgtgtcode. The code is as followsp  precode...

HashMapltString, Stringgt att  new HashMapltString, Stringgt     att.putname, value      attributes.addatt     return this  codepre  pThe codeattributescode variable is a collection of type codeTreeSetltHashMapltString,Stringgtgtcode. Now using Netbeans debugger Ive added a BreakPoint right after the creation of the XMLRoot object, and what Ive found is that it never reaches the breakpoint. The problem is that no exceptions are thrown, no errors, nothing. Another strange thing is that if I add only one element using the codeaddAttributecode method then all works fine.p  pstrongQuestionstrong What could have caused the execution to terminate inside the add method of the TreeSet class for the second element...p  pstrongNotestrong Using the debugger I managed to see the first attribute being set, but I never reach the second one, which means the execution ends abruptly while adding the second element.p  pstrongDetailsstrong Apple JDK 1.6.051 64Bit OSX 10.8.4 Mountain Lionp
Negative 8722 pHow can I create a dynamically calculated field to determine the age in days based on a datetime stampp  pFor example say I have a field that has a date time stamp.  What I want to be able to see when browsing the cube is a column showing the number of days since the time stamp.  So if the date time stamp is 82113 1200PM and I browse the cube on 82213 1200PM, the calculated column Number of Days Since would show 1.  p  pIs this even possible with SSASp

Its possible to save, update, delete and load all objects persisted in the DB and all of their children. If Im loading an object of type codeAcode, calling codegetBscode at the frontend included, I get the right one and all of its childs displayed. But hibernate does Hibernate delete from AB where Bid immediately after the SELECT statement. This deletes all relations between the object and its children.  If I change codeFetchTypecode of codeBcode to EAGER, everything works fine. It seems, that hibernate removes tue to the fact, that codegetAscode of the children objects isnt called. p  pI also tried changing codegetAscode of class codeBcode top  precodeJoinTablenameAB, joinColumnsJoinColumnnameBid, inverseJoinColumnsJoinColumnnameAid     public ListltAgt getAs [...] codepre  pBy the way, Im usingp  ul lihibernate 4.2.4 finalli liJSF 2.0li liJPA 2.0li ul  pIve read many related articles and tried different suggestions with Cascade etc. Also I thought about calling codegetAscode in the constructor of codeBcode, but all these things doesnt solve my problem.p  pWhile debbuging my application I added one row to the getter of class codeBcodep  precodepublic ListltAgt getAs      ifanull a.size     return a  codepre  pCalling codea.sizecode doesnt change anything. So I was bewildered as everything works suddenly. So as a conclusion, my application works now with this fix. But I would be grateful if anybody could give me a more common solution.p

Negative 8722 pI want to hide some items in ListView depending on some criteria. I found 2 solutions but none of them work.

The second one was to set codeView.GONEcode in codegetItemcode method. But ListView still reservates place for invisible items and that leads to the empty views in my list.

Negative 8722 pIn my game engine I use Box2D for physics. Box2Ds naming conventions and poor commenting ruin the consistent and well documented remainder of my engine which is a little frustrating and presents poorly when youre using it.p  pIve considered making a set of wrapper classes for Box2D. That is, classes which extend each of the common Box2D objects and have their functions rewritten to follow the naming conventions of the rest of my engine, and to have them more clearly and consistently commented. I have even considered building ontop of some of the classes and adding some bits and pieces like getters for pixelbased measurements in the codeb2Vec2code class.p  pThis is fine but I am not 100 sure what the negative impacts of this would be and the degree to which those would affect my applications and games. Im not sure if the compiler alleviates some of my concerns to a degree or whether I do need to be considerate when adding somewhat unnecessary classes for the sake of readability and consistency.p  pI have some suspicionsp  ul liMore memory consumption to accommodate the extra level of class structure.li liPerformance impact when creating new objects due to initializing an extra level of membersli ul  pI am asking specifically about runtime impacts.p

Negative 8722 pIm writing a simple server in JavaScript on Node.js, which among other things allows the user to manage their account basic CRUD functionality, etc. The server is connected to a MongoDB instance, using Mongoose to manage the connection and data.p  pModels in Mongoose have a method called codefindOneAndUpdatecode, which does exactly what you think it does queries the database for the first document returned and updates said document based on parameters you passed. It then returns the new, updated document to the user. It works exactly as intended and I have no problem with it.p  pHowever, I dont want ALL of the user data returned. Specifically, Id like to omit the codeidcode and codepasswordcode fields. Since the object returned by MongoDB is a basic JavaScript object, I assumed that Id be able to remove those attributes by calling codedelete object.attributecode.

Negative 8722 pThis will be just a noobie question This is one step of a multistage process which runs predominantly in IMACROS. So I need a solution which I can access by IMACROS in firefox browser.

Negative 8722 pIn one of my WPF project, I have integrated WPF Toolkits codeAutoCompleteBoxcode control. I need a custom codeContext Menucode for this control and I have added one using the codeContextMenucode property. Unfortunately its not showing the custom created one but showing the default one i.e. Cut, Copy, Paste with Cut amp Copy as disabled. p  pTo recreate the issue, I have created a sample project and the window contains 2 controls inside a codeGridcode.p  precodeltGridgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinitiongtltRowDefinitiongt             ltRowDefinitiongtltRowDefinitiongt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         lttoolkitAutoCompleteBoxgt             lttoolkitAutoCompleteBox.ContextMenugt                 ltContextMenugt                     ltMenuItem HeaderMenu Item 1gtltMenuItemgt                     ltMenuItem HeaderMenu Item 2gtltMenuItemgt                 ltContextMenugt             lttoolkitAutoCompleteBox.ContextMenugt         lttoolkitAutoCompleteBoxgt         ltTextBox Grid.Row1 gt             ltTextBox.ContextMenugt                 ltContextMenugt                     ltMenuItem HeaderMenu Item 1gtltMenuItemgt                     ltMenuItem HeaderMenu Item 2gtltMenuItemgt                 ltContextMenugt             ltTextBox.ContextMenugt         ltTextBoxgt     ltGridgt codepre  pThe two controls have the same codeContextMenucode and if I run the solution, I can see that the custom created codeContextMenucode is  working for codeTextBoxcode and not for codeAutoCompleteBoxcode. p  pAlso, I set the same Context Menu to Grid parent control and set  codeContextMenuxNullcode to TextBox amp codeAutoCompleteBoxcode. Now the codeContextMenucode is inherited for codeTextBoxcode but not for codeAutoCompleteBoxcode. p  pSo my question is, how can I create a custom codeContextMenucode for AutoCompleteBox  If it is not by designcodeAutoCompleteBoxcode, how can I add a codeContextMenucode to a custom AutoCompleteBox control which is inherited from codeAutoCompleteBoxcode.  Please advice.p

Negative 8722 pI am using Jackson for JSON serialization and have written a couple custom codeStringcode serializers, one for each getter method of a class. The methods each return the same type, codeSetltStringgtcode, but each uses a different serializer.p  pUnfortunately, Jackson is not using each serializer, one for each method, but is using one serializer for both. It appears to take whatever method comes first alphabetically and uses its serializer for both methods. What I expect is that the serializer annotated on the first method is used for the first method, and the serializer annotated on the second method is used on the second method. Debugging appears to indicate that Jackson has the serializers in a map keyed by return type of the method which is the same for both.p  pemAn Exampleemp  precodepublic class FooBar     private SetltStringgt foos  new HashSetltStringgt   private SetltStringgt bars  new HashSetltStringgt    JsonPropertyFooWrapper   JsonSerializecontentUsing  FooSerializer.class   public SetltStringgt getFoos      return foos       JsonPropertyBarWrapper   JsonSerializecontentUsing  BarSerializer.class   public SetltStringgt getBars      return bars     codepre  pAny suggestions on how to get the codegetFooscode method to serialize with a codeFooSerializercode, and the codegetBarscode method to serialize with the codeBarSerializercode In this example, the codeBarSerializercode is invoked for both methods.p  pNote, if I change the signature of one of the methods to another collection type so they are different  codeListltStringgtcode for example  the serialization works.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 8722 pIs there any way to disable crossdomain ajax requestp  pLets say there are two domains strongemmywebsite.comemstrong and strongemhackerswebsite.comemstrong. On the strongemmywebsite.comemstrong there is a website which contains javascript with AJAX function which sends data to strongemhackerswebsite.comemstrong. All I want is to prevent this and allow only sending AJAX request to emmywebsite.comem domain.p  pI know there is something like emSame origin policyem but what I understand it works on the second domain and can prevent connections from other domains.p  pTo be more precise, lets say that I have a website where users can run their own javascript. If they can write their own scripts they can get any data from DOM document and send it asynchronously to their own server which will accept data from my domain. For example login name. Am i rightp  pPlease correct me if Im wrong. Im just trying to understand this security policy thing.p

I have the structure defined for the interfaces and objects but am struggling to map the objects using Fluent NHibernate, presumably because the codeProductTypecode is not a generic class but has a generic property codeListltAttributeFieldltTgtgtcode where T can be anything.p  pInterfaces  IProductTypep  precodepublic interface IProductType      Guid Id  get set      string Name  get set      ListltIAttributeFieldgt Fields  get set   codepre  pInterfaces  IAttributeField  IAttributeFieldp  precodepublic interface IAttributeField      Guid Id  get set      string Name  get set      IProductType ProductType  get set    public interface IAttributeFieldltTgt  IAttributeField      Guid Id  get set      string Name  get set      ListltIAttributeValueltTgtgt Values  get set      IProductType ProductType  get set   codepre  pInterfaces  IAttributeValuep  precodepublic interface IAttributeValueltTgt      Guid Id  get set      T Value  get set      IAttributeFieldltTgt Field  get set   codepre  pClasses  ProductTypep  precodepublic class ProductType  IProductType      public Guid Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public ListltIAttributeFieldgt Fields  get set   codepre  pClasses  AttributeFieldp  precodepublic class AttributeFieldltTgt  IAttributeFieldltTgt      public Guid Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public ListltIAttributeValueltTgtgt Values  get set      public IProductType ProductType  get set   codepre  pClasses  AttributeValuep  precodepublic class AttributeValueltTgt  IAttributeValueltTgt      public Guid Id  get set      public T Value  get set      public IAttributeFieldltTgt Field  get set   codepre  pI am using Fluent NHibernate for ORM with a SQL 2008 database and have the following mapping classesp  pClasses  ProductTypeMappingp  precodepublic class ProductTypeMapping  ClassMapltIProductTypegt      public ProductTypeMapping              Not.LazyLoad         Idx gt x.Id.GeneratedBy.GuidNative         Mapx gt x.Name.Length50.Not.Nullable         HasManyx gt x.Fields.CollectionTypeltIAttributeFieldgt       codepre  pClasses  AttributeFieldMappingp  precodepublic class GenericAttributeFieldMapping  ClassMapltIAttributeFieldgt      public GenericAttributeFieldMapping              Not.LazyLoad         Idx gt x.Id         Mapx gt x.Name.Length50.Not.Nullable         Referencesx gt x.ProductType.Cascade.All        public class AttributeFieldMappingltTgt  ClassMapltIAttributeFieldltTgtgt      public AttributeFieldMapping              Not.LazyLoad         Idx gt x.Id.GeneratedBy.GuidNative         Mapx gt x.Name.Length50.Not.Nullable         HasManyx gt x.Values.Cascade.AllDeleteOrphan         Referencesx gt x.ProductType.Cascade.All       codepre  pClasses  AttributeValueMappingp  precodepublic class AttributeValueMappingltTgt  ClassMapltIAttributeValueltTgtgt      public AttributeValueMapping              Not.LazyLoad         Idx gt x.Id.GeneratedBy.GuidNative         Mapx gt x.Value.CustomTypeltTgt         Referencesx gt x.Field.Cascade.All       codepre  pWhen I try to unit test the above with a codenew PersitenceSpecificationltProductTypegtcode I get the following errorp  pstrongUnit Test Adapter threw exception  Type is not resolved for member FluentNHibernate.Cfg.FluentConfigurationException,FluentNHibernate, Version1.3.0.733, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken8aa435e3cb308880..strongp  pWhen debugging further I get the following exception messagep  pstrongNo persister for System.Collections.Generic.List1[[Models.Interfaces.IAttributeField, Models, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull]]strongp  pPresumably this is because I cannot use generic types for mapping and need to provide mapping for each generic type to map against.p  pHow can I have the structure detailed above work with dependency injection and ORM without having to explicitly provide mapping for each generic type OR what changes can be made to my approach to work with ORM whilst still providing the flexibility to have models with different attributes fields and valuesp

Negative 8722 pI seem to have a problem with adding rows to a codeDataGridcodethrough the interface itself.

Negative 8722 pOn my iOS app, Im using codeAVAssetReadercode to decode a local MP4 file and codeopenGLEScode to renderer each YUV420 frames. Im using the presentation timestamp to drive the playback at the proper frame rate. What its not clear to me is if I should use codeCADisplayLinkcode callback to know when a frame should be displayed always observing the PTS or if its okay to dont use it and have instead a secondary thread that simply pulls the decoded images and renders them via codeopenGLEScode. I have experimented both solutions and both seem to work at least to my eyes. Also the time it takes to display a YUV frame in both case seems to be about the same 23ms. So what is the deal with codeCADisplayLinkcode it seems not to be necessary but its recommended...I dont understand. Can some one explain to mep

Negative 8722 pI have vertex buffers holding meshes of terrain chunks. Whenever the player edits terrain, the mesh of the corresponding chunk must be regenerated and uploaded to the vertex buffer. Since regenerating the mesh takes some time, I do it in an asynchronous worker thread.p  pThe issue is that the main threads draws the buffer in the same moment the worker thread uploads new data. That means, after the player editing the terrain, a corrupted chunk gets rendered for one frame. It just flares up once and after that, the correct buffers gets drawn.p  pThis kind of made sense to me, we shouldnt write and read the same data at the same time of course. So instead of updating the old buffer, I created a new one, filled it and swapped them. The swapping was just changing the buffer id stored within the terrain chunk struct, so that should be atomic. Hoever, that didnt help.p  pDue to the fact that OpenGL commands are sent to a queue on GPU, they dont have to be executed when the application on the CPU continues. So I may have swapped the buffers before the new one was actually ready.p  pI also tried an alternative to switching the buffers, using a mutex for buffer access. The main thread locks the mutex while drawing and the worker thread locks it while uploading new buffer data. However, this didnt help either and it may be because of OpenGLs asynchronous nature, too. The main thread didnt actually draw, but just send draw commands to the GPU. On the other hand, when there really is only one command queue, uploading buffers and drawing them could never occur at the same time, does itp  pHow can I synchronize the vertex buffer access from my two threads to prevent that an undefined buffer gets drawn for one framep

Negative 8722 pstrongThe problemstrongp  pI have a jquery ajax post based website, where the website doesnt refresh every time user navigates to another page. Which means I have to pull data with ajax and present it to the user. Now for pulling small text data, this system works great. However once the text data is huge lets say over 200,000 words, the load time is quite high especially for mobile users. What I mean to say is, ajax tries to load full text information and displays it after it is done loading all text. So the user has to wait quite a bit to get the information.p  pIf you look at a different scenario, lets say wikipedia. There are big pages in wikipedia. However, a user doesnt feel heshe has to wait a lot because the page loads step by step top to bottom. So even if the page is large, the user is already kept busy with some information. And while the user is processing those, rest of the page keeps loading.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pSo is it possible to display, via ajax, information on real time load Meaning keep showing whatever is loaded and not wait for the full document to be loadedp

Negative 8722 pSCENARIO a P2P distributed network in which users connect by a DHT. They identify themselves by a hexadecimal 76character string.p  pPROBLEM users need to choose their own ID, not have a really long and random one assigned to them. And with security in mind, the network needs to remain 100 distributed, so servers with pubkeyusername arent possible.p  pPOSSIBLE SOLUTION distributed databases. However, how can we guarantee the uniqueness of the username A blockchain  la bitcoin isnt a possibility because downloading gigabytes of data also isnt user friendly and also not useful for dynamic content.p  pPOSSIBLE SOLUTION Distributed file systems such as TahoeLAFS. Extremely complicated and overkill, not easily or cleanly implemented.p  pSo, the issue is having userfriendliness and securitydistribution at the same time.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 8722 pStack,p  pIm developing an application to work with Revit 2014.  Whether it will run inside of Revit or outside as an external application is yet to be determined.  At this point, Im attempting to prove the concept using commands through the add in tab.  The goal is to allow the user to create conduit in Revit through an external interface, but I cant seem to find a method similar to AutoCADs Pick Point.  Id like for the user to select a point, or series of, and have the XYZs communicated back to me via the API.  Ill use those points to perform some calculations, addingfilling shared parameters based on the work being done, then draw the conduit for them, just as Revit would.  I know that Revit is lacking in their Electrical API, so if it has to be done with a pipe or placeholder and then converted to a conduit, thats fine too.  p  pIve successfully created conduithpipepipe placeholders with known XYZs Hardcoded but the idea is have the user choose the XYZ.

Negative 8722 pIm trying to build LLVM 3.4 to link against libstdc, however on Mavericks it seems the default is now to use libc and Ive having trouble running configure as it seems most options are defined to enable libc  c11 rather than disable them.p  pIncidentally the reason for doing this is that I have dependencies on libraries built with libstdc that I need to use along with the LLVM libraries and without having two separate versions of the standard library which Ive also tried without much success, Ive settled on trying to get all the libraries built with libstdc.p  pFollowing the documentation, Im using these commandsp  precode.configure prefixtoolsllvm3.4 buildx8664appledarwin13.1.0 enablepic enabletargetshost withcxxincluderootusrincludec4.2.1  make install ENABLEOPTIMIZED1 j16 codepre  pHowever, it seems this is still linking against libc. Any help would be appreciatedp  pEditp  pFollowing a suggestion in the comments, Ive also investigated the cmake alternative for building this using the following commandsp  precodecmake DCMAKEBUILDTYPERelease DLLVMTARGETSTOBUILDX86 DCMAKEINSTALLPREFIXtoolsllvm3.4 DLLVMENABLECXX110 DLLVMENABLEPIC1 ..llvm  make install codepre  pI have found what seems to be a good way of achieving what I want using the following extra flagp  precodeDCMAKECXXFLAGSstdliblibstdc codepre  pWith so many options to set up c11, this doesnt feel particularly intuitive, so Id be happy to find out theres a better supported way of achieving this. If not, I can happily add this as an answer.p
Negative 8722 pI have an Antlr grammar that is currently about 1200 lines. It parses the language that I want, but for at least one construct it is prohibitively slow even for smaller input files. The execution time seems to be growing exponentially for each added element of the construct.p  pI want to know if there are any good guidelines for debuggingprofiling such performance problems.p  pI have already tried with VisualVM and that gave be the name of the two methods closureCheckingStopState and closure, but that does not bring be much closer to figure out what is wrong with the grammar.p

Negative 8722 pIs there a proper term for a form that dynamically and intelligently updates its fields based on the selection of previous fieldsp  pFor example, if strongObject Typestrong where to be a dropdown box and strongPersonstrong and strongVehiclestrong where to be the options.

Negative 8722 pI have the following use scenario User logs in to ASP.NET application and at some point makes a connection to remote TCPIP server. The servers response may come after significant delay say, a few hours. Imagine that the user submits a batch job, and the job may be running for a long time. So, the user may close the browser, get some coffee and come back to see the results later.p  pHowever, if client closes the connection, the server will emneverem return the results. So, keeping Socket info in Application object wont work  once user closes the browser, it goes away.p  pIs there any other way to persist this open socket while IIS is up Also, if the second user logs in, I would prefer to use the same connection.

And as long as the user doesnt log out  everything is working fine now. Everything is on the LAN, so there are no routing issues to complicate the situation.p

And I understand the reason behind why as well now after searching here.p  pThat leaves me with this question.  Is it safe to use a variable like thisp  precodefields  col1, col2, col3   SELECT fields FROM table WHERE id codepre  pI ask, because I have a large statement, and its nice to be able to make the statement short and use codefieldscode which contains a very long string.

I havent tried to use codestmtgtgetresultcode yet, just upgraded php to be able to use it yesterday.p  pI have a general idea of how SQL Injection works, and from all the reading Ive been doing it seems the idea of a prepared and parametrized statement is it prevents SQL Injection by having SQL not run the whole statement, but breaks it apart to put it simply...p  pYet when I put the codefieldscode variable, is that opening it back up to SQL Injection now that I have a variable directly in the statement  codefieldscode is hard coded, not coming from any source other than the code itself not from user, not from database.  I dont know the extent to which SQL Injections can potentially attack, which is why Im asking here. I can deal with a long statement, but this will help me understand the proper way as well make it more secure. p  pThank you.p
Negative 8722 pIve encountered an issue with the OpenID option for the users API in Google App Engine that is limited to apps running on a custom domain. When I test my app it works fine in the appspot domain and localhost debugger but crashes on the custom one that I added through the control panel. I managed to get the login with Google Accounts working by asking for the domain to be registered on Googles deprecated OpenID 2 API but the login for any other OpenID account still crashes to an app engine 500 page. It seems that the app engine API just isnt expecting calls from my custom domain.p  pI can get any screenshots or code snippets that you need to find the issue.

Negative 8722 pCurrently, we have a maven project with a few thousand tests that takes two hours to run.  Weve tried running these in parallel, but since they are functional tests, each test configures the system in a specific way, which leads to race conditions and random test failures.  What Id like to do is spin up N servers on AWS, then have maven divide my tests up and run them on these servers each server would run its tests sequentially, but all servers would run in parallel, then aggregate the results.  Is there any plugin that does something like this  Ive seen something close to what I want implemented in Jenkins, but Id prefer it to be maven driven so developers can use it locally without having Jenkins installed.p

Negative 8722 pI am having a problem with memory leaking in my code, I have a need to GET many URLs in quick succession, each GET is influenced by the result of the previous GET. The purpose is to look for a specific piece of content within the response. p  pI found the cleanest way to implement this is recursively, as I can use the same method to identify if the desired value is present in the response. Functionally it works very well, but it leaks memory as described below.

These classes are not EF or NH classes.p  pBreeze correctly generates the base class and inherited classes in the metadata and correctly shows the navigation properties from the base class on the inherited classes.p  pWhen loading the data from the API, breeze correctly links the Child  Parent side of the linked navigation property, but does not map the reverse Parent  Child relationship on the base class.p  pIf I move the navigation property to the inherited child class, out of the basesuper class then Breeze correctly links all the relationships from the Parent to the Child and the Child to the Parent.p  precodepublic class Fine     public int Id  get set         Primary Key    public int VehicleId get set   Foreign Key    public decimal Amount  get set     ... etc   public class Vehicle     public int Id  get set  Primary Key    ... other common properties    public IListltFinegt Fines  get set    Common nav property   public class Motorcycle     public string MudguardColour  get set     ... other specific properties   public class MotorVehicle     public string BumperColour  get set     ... other specific properties  codepre  pBreeze creates the entities on the client side that correctly reflects the shapes above and has ko.observable as well as ko.observablearray for the one to many Vehicle  Fines properties.p  pIf I query the server for the list of MotorVehicles and MotorCycles first, all is well. I then query the list for fines separately and breeze correctly links the Fines that are related to a specific Vehicle correctly. I can the say fine.motorVehicle.id or fine.motorCycle.id, depending on the type and get the basesuper class properties, like Id as well.p  pBreeze however does not link the vehicle.fines, motorVehicle.fines nor the motorCycle.fines navigation properties. They remain empty arrays even though the fine entity is linked correctly to the vehicle, motorVehicle and motorCycle entities.p  pIf I move the navigation property to to the childinherited class, then breeze correctly links the entities as expected.p  precodepublic class Fine     public int Id  get set         Primary Key    public int VehicleId get set   Foreign Key    public decimal Amount  get set     ... etc   public class Vehicle     public int Id  get set  Primary Key    ... other common properties    public IListltFinegt Fines  get set    Common nav property   public class Motorcycle     public string MudguardColour  get set     ... other specific properties     public IListltFinegt Fines  get set    Common nav property now in child class   public class MotorVehicle     public string BumperColour  get set     ... other specific properties  codepre  pThis gives me fine.vehicle.id, fine.motorVehicle.bumperColour and fine.MotorCycle.mudguardColour as well as parent  child relationship vehicle.fines[0].amount and motorCycle.fines[0].amount.p  pHow do I get breeze to set these navigation properties when they are on the basesuper class to avoid repeating them on the childinherited classesp  pPS I am not using EF nor NH, but my metadata is modelled based on the NH layout from the breeze NH samples as well as the Breeze documentation with the required foreign keys related etc.p  pPPS All of this works 100 for normal classes that do not use the inheritance setup.p  pHope I have explained sufficientlyp

Negative 8722 pI know that running an app which possess sensitive information on a rooted device is not secure at all. So developers usually do root detection in such cases and if the device is found rooted,then that app wont get installed. everything is ok.p  pThe major techniques used by developers in root detection are checking for the superuser.apk file,check for chainfire,busybox,executing su command,etc. But an attacker can simply bypass these checks by several means like renaming the superuser.apk to superuser0.apk. p  pSo what I am looking for is a unique solution for this issue where the root detection checks cannot be bypassed by attacker. Please share your views even if such a solution doesnt exists. Because the solutions from you guys might help in atleast hardening the code of root detection.p

Negative 8722 pI have set up JBoss 7.1.1Final in domain mode with 1 master amp 1 slave instances. Apache HTTPD is at the front end providing fail over  load balancing. Session replication is set up amp working fine. p  pUsing Spring 3, I have injected one of the cache defined in domain.xml into a class provided by me. The purpose is to disallow concurrent login through the same user ID. For JBoss instances with sticky sessions, Spring provided SessionRegistryImpl works fine. But in cluster mode with non sticky sessions, a custom class ClusterAwareSessionRegistryImpl is implemented which is same as SessionRegistryImpl but instead of using local Maps it uses the injected cache with replication. Putting application specific class objects into the cache works and no exception is thrown. But when the cache is accessed for the objects on another jboss node then deserialzation results in ClassNotFoundException. From the exception it looks like that the application specific classes are not visible to  JBoss classloader. Searched amp tried a lot but I am unable to make this work. Setting cache with the classloader didnt work or maybe I missed something i.e. org.infinispan.Cache.getAdvancedCache.withthis.getClass.ClassLoaderp  pKindly point me in the right direction.p

Negative 8722 pIt looks like the need to use dynamic SQL is unavoidable with SQL Server for different reasons but the resulting code looks convoluted and unmaintainable. SQL server management studios intellisence stops working for queries inside literals and overall with all this string manipulation stuff its a mess IMO.p  pWhat are your approaches to simplifying this and making the SQL more maintainable p  pexcept of course not using SQL directly at all and relying on an ORM which is not an option in my current situationp  pstrongEditstrong In my current particular case I have an SP with several filtering parameters that are used in the where clause with like, when a parameter is null or empty it should not be included in the where clause, trying to avoid dynamic sql with codeparam IS NULL OR column LIKE paramcode leads to poor performance.p

I am working on a project which uses  android street view panorama and Google map p  pI just noticed that there is no method in street view panorama for querying whether a street view exists in any location before searching for the panorama image, to prevent the app from crashing or showing black screen. Is there a solution to this problem.

Negative 8722 pI recently tried to post a note on facebook where I wrote codePTnltMcode. It got terribly deformed. I eventually figured out codeltmgtcode had to be some HTML command, so I fixed the issue by codePTn lt Mcode. I googled for a hrefhttpswww.google.itsearchqhtml3Cm3Eampieutf8ampoeutf8ampgwsrdcrampeiXcPYVPDlNMb1UPTkgAM relnofollowHTML codeltmgtcodea and a hrefhttpswww.google.itsearchqhtml3Cm3Ecommandampieutf8ampoeutf8ampgwsrdcrampeiacPYVMuiMsT0UvWQhLAI relnofollowHTML codeltmgtcode commanda but didnt seem to find anything useful. So I come here and ask what does codeltmgtcode do in HTML Is it an HTML command in the first place Note I know mostly nothing about HTML, but I emdoem know that if I type codeltmgtcode in here without the code markup it simply vanishes, and if I type it in a facebook note everything after it is lowercased and every word is made to be followed by codecode or something like that, and at the end of the note an codeltmgtcode appears. I emdoem know that HTML often uses codeltfoogt ltfoogtcode for things, so I think this emisem in fact HTML. Of course I dont know if facebook or SX use HTML, so that is a guess. Could you enlighten mep

Negative 8722 pI am working on a project and have hit a brick wall again.  I have a listbox with some math operations in it i.e. 123.  I am trying to save all items in the listbox to an access database, and I think I am getting close.  The database has two entries I put in manually, but when I use the following code I only get 1s plus the two manual entries in the listbox when I clear the listbox and load the database into the listbox.  The other issue is I need to limit the database to 10 rows which I have no idea how to do. What I would like to do is check the database each time I save to it to see how many rows it has.  If the number of listbox items I am saving will exceed 10 rows in the database then clear the database and start from 0 rows.

Negative 8722 pI am running a large Grails app on a CentOS server. p  pThe server is set to EST GMT  5.p  pWhen I deploy the app as a war file, the apps date and time will be correct for a few days, and then suddenly the app becomes confused and thinks it is in GMT, not EST. p  pThis causes dates on domain objects to be incorrect, and also causes Quartz jobs to run at the wrong time.

Negative 8722 pSo what Im trying to do is update a table of answers with new values when a user goes backs and editchanges previous answers. So a questionnaire has like 20 questions that a user fills out and then get saved off in a QuestionnaireResponseTable and if they go back and change their answers I want to update the table. Simple enough. p  pThe tricky part is I want to protect against SQL injection so when Im building my stmnt Im inserting the user answers as parameters in case they try to do something shady. The problem is since Im trying to update say all 20 rows in a single database command I have answer stated multiple times. What I have found is that npgsql treats all the answer the same. So when I go to modify the 20rows in the database with each row corresponding to a question the user answered. Instead of getting 20 row with 20 unique answer every row ends up getting updated with the same answer. p  pI tried using string.format to do something like answer0,i to differentiate the answers but that did work and threw an exception. Ive gotten everything to work by not using parameters to insert the user provided answers so I know my posgresql command works the issue is just doing it in a safe manner to protect against injection.p  precodepublic void UpdateAnswersListltstringgt paramAnswers          Listltstringgt answers  paramAnswers         string stmnt  UPDATE demographicresponses AS dr SET answer  c.answer FROM values           string updateVals           for int i  1 i lt answers.Count i              updateVals  updateVals  string.FormatAppApplication.Current.participantDM.id, i,  answer0,,i                  updateVals  updateVals.Substring0, updateVals.Length1          stmnt  stmnt  updateVals   AS cuserid, questionid, answer WHERE c.questionid  dr.questionid AND c.userid  dr.userid          using NpgsqlConnection conn  PgConnection.GetConnection              using NpgsqlCommand cmd  new NpgsqlCommandstmnt, conn                  for int i  0 i lt answers.Count i                      cmd.Parameters.AddPgHelpers.ToNpgsqlParameterDemographicResponseTable.Column.answer                     cmd.Parameters[i].Value  answers[i]                                      cmd.ExecuteNonQuery                            codepre

Negative 8722 pI have hit a roadblock in my access form and Ive searched high and low for an answer.  I have a form Enter Numbers in which users enter information that obviously is stored in a table Numbers.  I need to have a field  of models in the numbers table, however, I dont want to ask the users to input that information.  Furthermore, in another table property info I have that information already inputted.  Now before you tell me that it is redundant...blah blah blah, to store the same information in two tables.....the  of models field in the property info table may change, whereas by storing that number in the numbers table each time users enter info in the form, Im getting a snapshot that will not change. p  pI have a textbox that uses a dlookup function to pull the  of models from the property info table and displays it in the form.  I had and have no clue why it no longer functions properly a button in the form, that when pushed would run the following code  text66  models  Then I had a docmd.close so that it would put the dlookup result located in field models into text66 whose control source is the field  of models in the numbers table.  This was functioning flawlessly, and then something happened, and now when I click the button I receive a you cant assign a value to this object error.p  pI dont care by what method I copy the dlookup result into the numbers table, but I would certainly appreciate any help in doing so  Thanks.p

Negative 8722 pSo I have read a lot about MVC online and have learned about it in class, but I am still lost on one aspect  changing and showing Views.

If the View did not change to another View, I know to use the ObserverObservable interface to update the View.

I want to use 2 distinct Views I think.p  pIm having trouble structuring my code to achieve this, and I dont know where to put the ActionEventListenersp

Negative 8722 pI am currently using ValumsFileUploader to upload files to my server. The plugin uses javascript to load the images and uses php to save them. The drawback is that it does not resize photos before uploading them therefore taking more time to upload and using more resources. I came across a php script that does in fact resize images but I do not know how to take the part that does the resizing and apply it to the Valums original fileuploader.php. Since my experience in php is limited, I wanted to know if it is possible to take such an approach. I will list both of the files for reference.p  pNotice the php file in question resizes images and also creates thumbnails. the resizing feature is the one I am interested in. p  pThanks in advance.p  pThis is the Valums fileuploader.phpp  precodeltphp class qqUploadedFileXhr     Save the file to the specified path   return boolean TRUE on success   function savepath      input  fopenphpinput, r     temp  tmpfile     realSize  streamcopytostreaminput, temp     fcloseinput      if realSize  thisgtgetSize         return false           target  fopenpath, w     fseektemp, 0, SEEKSET     streamcopytostreamtemp, target     fclosetarget      return true  function getName      return GET[qqfile]  function getSize      if issetSERVER[CONTENTLENGTH]         return intSERVER[CONTENTLENGTH]      else          throw new ExceptionGetting content length is not supported.         return false          class qqUploadedFileForm   function savepath      ifmoveuploadedfileFILES[qqfile][tmpname], path         return false          return true  function getName      return FILES[qqfile][name]  function getSize      return FILES[qqfile][size]    class qqFileUploader  var allowedExtensions  array var sizeLimit  10485760 var file  function constructarray allowedExtensions  array, sizeLimit    s10485760     allowedExtensions  arraymapstrtolower, allowedExtensions      thisgtallowedExtensions  allowedExtensions     thisgtsizeLimit  sizeLimit      thisgtcheckServerSettings      if issetGET[qqfile]          thisgtfile  new qqUploadedFileXhr      elseif issetFILES[qqfile]          thisgtfile  new qqUploadedFileForm      else          thisgtfile  false        function checkServerSettings     postSize  thisgttoBytesinigetpostmaxsize     uploadSize  thisgttoBytesinigetuploadmaxfilesize      if postSize lt thisgtsizeLimit  uploadSize lt thisgtsizeLimit         size  max1, thisgtsizeLimit  1024  1024 .

Negative 8722 pMy understanding is that Android instrumented JUnit tests run on their own thread unless annotated with codeUiThreadcode or calling a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappInstrumentation.htmlrunOnMainSyncjava.lang.Runnable relnofollowcodeInstrumentation.runOnMainSynccodea or a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActivity.htmlrunOnUiThreadjava.lang.Runnable relnofollowcodeActivity.runOnUiThreadcodea. Now Im trying to use a codeCursorLoadercode to access my apps database and populate a codeListViewcode. I also have a test which verifies that the codeListViewcode is populated correctly.p  pMy problem is that I need to synchronize three threads the test thread should wait until the codeCursorLoadercode thread finishes and notifies the UI thread to populate the codeListViewcode. To create a codeCursorLoadercode, I register a codeLoaderCallbackscode with the support codeLoaderManagercode and create the instance in codeonCreateLoadercode. Then codeonLoadFinishedcode changes the cursor of the codeListViewcodes adapter.p  pNow I need to ensure that my test waits until codeonLoadFinishcode has been called before attempting to access the child views of the codeListViewcode. My current idea is to add a codewaitForDatacode method to my codeLoaderCallbackscode implementation which the tests can call. However, Im not sure how to implement this method. Can I simply use a codewaitcode and then codenotifyAllcode in codeonLoadFinishedcode Or do I need to use something more sophisticated like a codeSemaphorecodep

Negative 8722 pI have an issue with one of the users of a SharePoint 2010 application concerning scheduled pages.p  pThe user creates a page and before submittingpublishing it created a Schedule for it for a future period of time lets say for Current Day  1 to Current Day  2.

The page is only visible to end users between the scheduled period of time.p  pThis issue tells me it is most likely a permissions problem, but still strikes me as one of those strange phenomena coming from SharePoint. The user which has issue has an Approval permission and the user without issue has full control permission. Is there any way that the Approval permission is somehow bypassing the whole workflow and allowing end users to see the page before the app user even approves itp

Negative 8722 pIm building an hour registration program with the use of a Windows calendar control. Now I have a question about the performance of this control when there are a lot of agenda items in it.

The Calendar control becomes very slow. p  pDoes anybody know what might cause thisp  pBy the way there is one thing I think that might cause this problem and that is that the windows calendar uses a view range to load items only within that view.  I tweaked this mechanism a bit because otherwise I could not save and open all the possible calendar item dates currently in the calendar control.p  pFor example the place items method use to be like thisp  precodeprivate void PlaceItems                      foreach CalendarItem item in items                              if calendar1.ViewIntersectsitem                                      calendar1.Items.Additem                                        codepre  pNow I use this codep  precodeprivate void PlaceItems              foreach CalendarItem item in items                      if calendar1.ViewIntersectsitem                          calendar1.Items.Additem                             codepre  pAre there workarounds for this problem without losing the ability to save and open all the calendaritems in the calendar at onesp  pThanks in advancep

Let t, l, and s be three security parameters. This protocol due to Chan, Frankel, and Tsiounis [7], and corrected in [8], and also due to [14] in another form proves that a committed number in x in I belongs to J, where the expansion rate JI is equal to 2tl1. Let n be a large composite number whose factorization is unknown by Alice and Bob, g be an element of large order in mathbbZn and h be an element of the group generated by g sucht hat both the discrete logarithm of g in bade h and the discrete logarithm of h in base g are unknown by Alice. Let H be a hashfunction which outputs 2tbit strings. We denote by EEx,rgxhrmod n a commitment to x in [0,b], where r is randomly selected over [2sn1,2sn1]. This commitment, from [13], statistically reveals no information about x to Bob.p      pstrongProtocolstrong PK[CFT]x,r EEx,r wedge x in [2tlb,2tlb].p      ol   liAlice picks random omega in R[0,2tlb1] and eta in R[2tlsn1,2tlsn1], and then computes Wgomegaheta mod n.li   liThen, she computes CHW and cC mod 2t.li   liFinally, she computes D1 omega  xc and D2 eta rc in mathbbZ. If D1 in [cb,2tlb1], she sends C,D1,D2 to Bob, otherwise she starts again the protocol.li   liBob checks that D1 in [cb,2tlb1] and that CHgD1hD2Ec. This convinces Bob that x in [2tlb, 2tlb].li   ol blockquote  pI have implemented other protocols in this paper successfully, however in this case I havent had any success, specifically because Alices check of D1 in [cb,2tlb1] always fails no matter how many times it is retried.
