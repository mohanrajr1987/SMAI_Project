Positive 4209 pThe goalp  pI have a URL of an image.

What I actually need is a way to download a file from a URL using codefilegetcontentscode and codefileputcontentscode to the same temporary location on the server that uploaded files are downloaded to. By that I would be able to handle files the same way regardless of how they got there URL or file upload.p

Positive 4209 pIm trying to implement blueimps fileupload widget in our product as a generic attachment uploader. The widget works well on its own Im wondering if there is a way to use an external ajax call rather using the widgets built in function. The concept is to use Backbone for the modules in the product and send the files with ajax. I can use the fileupload to to save my model and the files but it feels weird to do thisp  precodevar filesList  var f  fileupload.fileupload     url apifaqssave   f.onfileuploadadd, functione, data     filesList.pushdata.files[0]   button.clickfunctione     f.fileuploadsend, filesfilesList  codepre  pMy aim would be to use something like thisp  precodefileupload.fileupload ... .ajax     url apifaqssave,     data          question model.getquestion,         answer model.getanswer,         files filesList       codepre  pThis solution didnt work for me as it doesnt seem to send the correct payload to the server. I might be missing a contenttype setting or multipart option. Anyone did something similar before How do you normally use the upload for data entriesp

Positive 4209 pI want to develop an app in which I may need to support resumable file upload.

Im open for both serverclient side solutions.p
Positive 4209 pIve got a Code Igniter controller which reads the uploaded record file excel, csv, tsv, xml, etc and writes each line as a record into the database. The record ID which is the first column in the file should be unique. If it is already present in the database then while reading the file I should throw an alert and depending on the users response I will override or skip the record and continue with the other records. p  pBut once I throw the alert and reach the view, I loose the control of the controller and I dont know to keep the file pointer ticking so that I can continue to read after receiving the response from the user. p  pIs there a work around for this or do we have an other alternative methodp

Negative 4209 pIs this typical behavior of the UpdateProgress for an ASP.Net UpdatePanel  I have an update panel with the UpdateProgress control inside of a user control window on a page.  p  pIf I then make the page in the background do some loading and click a button in the user control update panel the UpdateProgress does not show up at all.  Its like the UpdatePanels refresh request is not even registered until after the actual page is done doing its business.  Its worth noting that it will show up if nothing is happening in the background.p  pThe functionality I want is what you would expect.  I want to loader to show up if it has to wait for anything to get its refresh done when after the button is clicked. p  pI know I can get this functionality if I just use jquery ajax with a static web method, but you cant have static web methods inside of a user control.  I could have it in the page but it really doesnt belong there.  A fullblown wcf wouldnt really be worth it in this case either.  Im trying to compromise with an UpdatePanel but these things always seem to cause me some kind of trouble.p  pMaybe this is just the way it worksp  pbEditbSo Ill clarify a bit what Im doing.p  pWhats happening is I have a page and all it has on it are some tools on the side and a big map.  When the page initially loads it takes some time to load the map.  Now if while its loading I open up the tool a user control that has the update panel in question in it and click the button on this user control that should refresh the update panel with new data and show the loading sign in the updateprogress then the UpdateProgress loading image does not show up.  However, the code run by the button click does run after the page is done loading as expected and The UpdateProgress will show up if nothing on the page containing the user control is loading.  p  pI just want the loader to show up while the page is loading.p  pI thought my problem was that perhaps the map loading is in an update panel and my UpdateProgress was only being associated with the update panel for the user controls update panel.  Hence, I would get no loading icon when the map was loading.  This is not the case though.p

Negative 4209 pI have a table, and one of the cells has dynamically generated content.p  pI want to have a background image that is exactly the same size as the cell. ie not tiled, but stretched.p  pIve found a very good reference a HREFhttpdsgdev.wordpress.com20070307gettablecellheightswithjavascript relnofollowherea, which tells you how to do it in Javascript. This example solves the problem by placing an HTML DIV on the top and the bottom of the cell, then getting Javascript to work out the vertical pixel difference between them.p  pThe biggest problem was that I declare the image asp  precode    ltaspImage IDimgContentsBackground CssClassContentsBackground runatserver ImageUrlImagesMoneyColour3.jpg gt codepre  pbut for some reason ASP.NET arbitrarily renamed the ID from imgContentsBackground to ctl00imgContentsBackground. Once I hardcoded that ID in the Javascript, the referenced example worked for me.p  pBut Im thinking  given the rich functionality of ASP.NET, is there a simpler way to determine the size and position of a table cell once the content has been generated, and make an image occupy those dimensionsp

Negative 4209 pI need the best way of performing the following task. If possible, take it all the way down to giving me variables for output so i can better see whats going on, a lot of times you guys assume im smarter than i am.p  pTable 1, holds user information, first and last name, email etc. The primary autoincrement key in table 1 is id. Table 2, holds a series of first and last names, its key is xid, and the table 1 id used to display only the owners list is uid. Table 3, holds config data for the users list in table 2. Since you can have multiple configs per list per user, it wasnt prudent to include it in table 2. So table 3 has cxid the table 2 key of xid, marking which list its for, and then uid, marking which table 1 user can access that config. Its autoincrement key is called cid.p  pSo to break it downp  precodeTable 1user  Primary key  id Table 2list  Primary key  xid, and user field is uid. Table 3config  Primary key  cid, list field is cxid, and user field is uid. codepre  pWhat i need to do, is formulate a mysql query on table 3, so that for every row, it extracts the cxid, and uid, then queries table 2 for the specific list. Once it finds the list, it needs to extract all data from that row in table 2, so that it can perform a function with that data.p  pIm not exactly sure where to start on writing this the most efficient way, im sure there is some kind of easy way of doing this. For the time being, the above values are just being passed in the URL, but i am going to change that to sessions, but just assume that before the query even starts, that ive defined each variable as p  precodevariable  GET[variable] codepre  pSo the variables are id, uid, cxid, xidp
Negative 4209 pstrongOverviewstrongp  pOur companys current system test cycle involves the use of word documents for the UI test scripts and test execution log.p  pFor each new release, these documents are copied from the previous release and then modified to reflect the current release version together with new test steps where there are changes in functionality.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pFirstly, this is timeconsuming  editing each word document around 150 docs just to make minor changes.

Negative 4209 pI was recently made aware that thread local storage is limited on some platforms.

This is an important question if youre writing a crossplatform app that uses TLS. Linux was the only platform I found information for, in the form of a patch Ingo Monar sent in 2002 to the kernel list adding TLS support, where he mentions, The number of TLS areas is unlimited, and there is no additional allocation overhead associated with TLS support. Which if still true in 2009 is it is pretty nifty.p  pBut what about Linux today OS X Windows Solaris Embedded OSes For OSs that run on multiple architectures does it vary across architecturesp  pEdit If youre curious why there might be a limit, consider that the space for thread local storage will be preallocated, so youll be paying a cost for it emon every single threadem. Even a small amount in the face of lots of threads can be a problem.p

Negative 4209 pI am currently working on a big project and maintaining all those include guards makes me crazy Writing it by hand is frustrating waste of time. Although many editors can generate include guards this doesnt help muchp  ol lipEditor generates guard symbol based on a filename. The problem occurs when you have headers with the same filename in different directories. Both of them will get the same include guard. Including directory structure into the guard symbol would require some fancy approach from the editor, since slashes and backslashes in the macro are not the best thing.pli lipWhen I have to rename a file I should rename all the include guards as well in the ifndef, define and ideally endifs comment. Annoying.pli lipPreprocessor is flooded with tons of symbols without a clue what they mean.pli lipNevertheless definition is included once, compiler still opens header every time it meets header inclusion.pli lipInclude guards dont fit into namespaces nor templates. In fact they are subverting namespacespli lipYou have a chance that your guard symbol wont be unique.pli ol  pMaybe they were acceptable solution in times when programs contained less than 1000 headers in single directory. But nowadays It is ancient, it has nothing to do with modern coding habits. What bothers me the most is that this issues could be almost compeletly solved by pragma once directive.

I am also thinking about maintaining a constants file that feeds in the required details. like no of rows, footer image location, file location  etc.p  pThanks. waiting for a reply.p  pstrongEditstrongbr Well guys I have 1000 of such files and I cant possibly open each one of these files and add footer etc and saving it as pdf.

Negative 4209 pSo I am currently working on a universal binary for an app that is to be ran on iPad and iPhone. The differences are basically only UI changes.p  pSo, with that in mind, I have a class called ConfigurationController that is of type UIViewController. I then sub class ConfigurationController into iPadConfigurationController and iPhoneConfigurationController.p  pNow, lots of the code is common, so I abstracted it out to the ConfigurationController. However, there are a few functions in which the changes result in 1 line code differences. Im currently in a debate with other developers about what to do with this code.p  pThere seem to be two paths 1 push the methods into the ConfigurationController super class, then use macros to determine if the app is being run on an iPad or an iPhone. Then call which ever code needs to be called based on that.p  p2 keep the methods in the subclasses iPadConfigurationController and iPhoneConfigurationController and keep the 1 line changes. This results in about 300 lines of code being duplicated. However, this leaves a path for the future, as in if there is a change now, there can be change after further development. In which case, I would already have the functions in the subclasses.p  pWhich would be more beneficial and have less overheadp

Im using this to represent the minimum spanning tree for a larger complete graph.p  pWhat I want to find is the single node within the graph that, when used as the root node, creates the shortest possible tree height. What Ive come up with is performing a depthfirst traversal using every node as the root, and keeping track of the shortest height seen. Is there a faster way to accomplish thisp

Negative 4209 pSo weve been through this several times now, we release a game for cheap and someone hacks it and puts it up on a mirror.  We setup Google Alerts for all our apps, so we get told daily whos doing the hacking.  So far, we have implemented the licensing service as Google has suggested, our salt is randomly made each time the license is initiated with the unique device ID.  We run the check service once, when the application is started for the first time.  We then generate a 512 character hash for the key and the stored value that is compared against in SharedPreferences from there on out. p  pNow, I know that checking once is probably where the application is being blocked.  Our bytecode has most likely been looked at and recompiled without the line that initiates the check. p  pFrom here, I dont want to obfuscate our code as I have seen it broken before.  I want something a little more solid, and I also want to learn how to do this properly.  I am more interested in learning than making money at this point since only 2 of people will ever look for a hacked version.p  pSo far, on my own, I have come up with a random number generator that is placed in several startup areas of the game.  When initiated say, 1 out of 50 times the license is checked.  I know this would make it harder to hack because the cracker would have to eliminate each case, compile, eliminate, compile. This method however, is still crackable...so what do you guys suggest  Again, I am really interested in this process of security, so please educate, dont turn this into a discussion on obfuscation or checking periodically based on a timestamp. p  pThanksp

Negative 4209 pIts my understanding that EC2 snapshots are incremental in nature, so snapshot B contains only the difference between itself and snapshot A. Then if you delete snapshot A, the difference is allocated to snapshot B in Amazon S3 so that you have a complete snapshot. This also leads me to believe that it isnt prohibitively expensive to have daily snapshots AZ for example, that it in storage cost it is basically the same as one snapshot.p  pWhat I really want is to back up my snapshots to a bucket in Amazon S3, so that if an entire EC2 region is having some problems ahem emcough, coughem the snapshot can be moved into another region and launched as a backup instance in a new region.p  pHowever, it seems you can only bundle an instance and then upload a bundled instance to S3, not a snapshot.p  pThe bundle is the entire instance correct If this is the case then are historical bundled instances significantly more costly in practice than snapshotsp

Negative 4209 pWe are in the making of an Android app, a quiz game, which we would like to cache questions  answers for when the user is offline. The problem with this is that we would need to withhold this data from the user until she has answered the questions. Otherwise, cheating would be very easy, which would harm the game. One could then extract all questions  answers and automatically submit answers to the server API.p  pThe most convenient way would be to retrieve a key or secret from our server at installation time, hide it somewhere, and use it for communication with the server, and also for the encryption of questions  answers in storage. But obviously, hiding it somewhere is not a secure concept.p  pI have researched a bit, and it seems that reliable encryption is not possible in such cases, because the app has to know the secret be it a certificate, passphrase  salt, or whatever or at least where it can be found, and this can be extracted by decompilation. However, we would be fine with it being hard enough to do.p  pThe question is strongDo you know of a way to make it prohibitively hard for regular users to retrieve a secret from the APK  i.e., make it nearimpossible to write an automated keyextractorstrongp  pMy best guesses so farp  ul liHide some information in the database and use it as salt for the keyli liAdd several bits of information from the device as salt IMEI, email address, serial number,...  perhaps together with obfuscation the way how the salt is applied might be hard to obtainli ul

Negative 4209 pThis probably wont make any sense, but thats why Im here.  Ive inherited a web site that Im trying to more features like Frankenstein needs a second left arm.p  pPart of the application makes about 10 different API calls to various service providers across the nation to get quotes.  It does this by generating several different URLs and using mcurl  to GET them in parallel. None of these return any html, they each query a single API and update the database.p  pIt takes a few seconds to run, spinning its wheels as it makes the API queries, but nothing in the database is updated. I can see in the logs each of the URLs that was requested.  If I take one of these urls, and put it in the address bar of a browser, it works just fine.  The api is called and the database is updated.p  pWait, theres more  In order to debug these individual scripts since they have no output I use fwrite.  This works when I use a URL in the address bar of a browser, but nothing is written then all scripts are executed via mcurl.  multicurlexecute to be precise.p  pIn short, when php uses curl to execute a script, it wont update the mysql database, and it wont allow me to fopen a file.  These do work if I cutpaste the GET request from the logs into a browsers address bar.p  pNow this software has been in production for a while on the live site, and works for them as expected.  Im doing development on my local machine, and this is where its failing. Its just got to be something very simple.p  pDavep

So if using the example above I long click on the displayed C row then I will actually get the data for D which is correct.  p  pAny ideap

Moreover, I would much prefer if my view could simply react to a change event rather than requiring reconstruction.p

I can see that my logic is flawed but I am pulling my hair out trying to figure out how I can get it to always give a set of 9 elements which all add up to 15.p  pFor example what I might end up with is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]p  pWhen what I need for example is [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2] or [2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]p  pand so on.p  pAny advice appreciated. Feel free to flame me for my poor sense of logic p

Negative 4209 pWhich data structure in Java would be best to implement an inmemory object cache, where objects have an individual expiration time p  pBasically for the cache I could use a Map where key could be a String which offers the put and get methods, and use a ordered list of timestampobject pairs to manage the expiration time. So a cleanup thread could check the first list entry and delete the object when its expiration time passed. Deletion of the first element should be in O1 timep

Negative 4209 pIve recently been assigned to a C project involving information being sent between computers via UDP. When a packet arrives, I have a program which accepts the data and can display it as a raw hexadecimal string. However, Im struggling to grasp exactly how this whole process is supposed to work. The hex string supposedly contains several fields e.g. a 4char array, some float32s, and some uint32s.p  pHow do I translate the sections of this string into the correct variable types The first value, an ASCII title, was simple enough the first eight chars in the hex string are a hexadecimal representation of an ASCII word 0x45 hex can be translated directly to the capital letter E. But the next value, a 32bit float, doesnt really make sense to me. What is the relation between the hex value 42 01 33 33 and the float value 32.3 a given examplep  pIm a bit in over my head here, I feel Im missing some essential information regarding the way number systems work.p

Negative 4209 pI am working on development of an embedded Linux device which needs to exchange data with a system that runs in a Windows desktop environment. My team is developing the software on the embedded device and designing the API to exchange data with the device. I would like some ideas on the data exchange architecture. I would like the architecture to follow SOA principles.p  pHere are the important specsp  ul liDatabase The device will run a SQL database server locally.li liNetwork The device and the desktop system will be connected via WLAN or LAN. Running a web server on the device is also possible if there is a compelling reason to do so.li liData will be exchanged in both directions. Textual customer information and jpeg image files 1MB of data once per day.li ul  pMy first thought is a traditional approach run a process on the Linux device that communicates via TCP socket to a process on the Windows side. In this scenario, my team needs to write a Windows DLL either .NET library or Win32 to implement the API. Im thinking the data format would be XML here, though, Im not sure how to transfer the .jpg image files with this approach.p  pI guess a more modern approach would be to run a web server on the Linux device and provide a set of web services to handle the interaction with the external system. Ive not had much experience in this arena, so Im not sure if this would be appropriate for our situation.p  pYour thoughts on these approaches are greatly appreciated. Im confident that the collective wisdom here on SO will help me make an informed decision. Thanks for your help.p

Now to make it harder the timezones are different and I want it to be timezone specific. Everyones changes at the same time but at 400pm after the race. So the Texas race would change at 400pm after the race and the people in LA would see it at 200pm because of timezones.p  pA.can you set it to change at a given timep  pB.Can it be specific to 400pm after the races timezone or will I need to convert all of them to the same timezones time.p  pIs this possible with just javascript and thank you for your time.p  pI want the date changes to be year specific as well, something like 3232011 change 4pm p  pHow would I set this up.

Furthermore, the earlier tags dont seem to have a corresponding patchreleases directory, so the same technique wont work for them even if I get it working for 3.2.3.p  pAs an aside, Im also deeply confused by things such as the 3.2.2 tag containing a 3.2.3 directory under patchreleases, etc.p  pAll of this leads me to think I may be missing the point in some fundamental manner p  pThe questions I thus have arep  ol liAm I checking out the right things in the first placeli liFrom which directories and how should I be building each of the tags pleaseli liDo I need the same version of Maven for all of the tagsli liIs there any good build documentation for the various different versions explaining some of this please Ive found various technical blogs, but seemingly nothing foolproof and comprehensive Im probably looking in the wrong places.li ol  pMany thanks.p

Negative 4209 pIm updating my PhoneGap iOSapp to make it compatible with the iPhone 5.p  pIm manually hiding the splash screen after my app has initialized.p  pWhen simulating iPhone 5 When the app starts it displays the correct splash screen Default568h2x.png hereon the 5 but quickly hides it and instead displays the iPhone 4 splash screen hereon the 4. The 4 doesnt cover the whole app, thus showing top and bottom bars of the app initializing.p  pIm not entirely sure how it works but I can think of two possible scenarios 1 Both images are displayed simultaneously but for some reason the 5 auto hides while the 4 waits for the call from the app to hide. 2 At some point when disabling manually hiding the splash screen phonegap switches out the true splashscreen for a fake one that is displayed until the javascript call from the app and phonegap just might not display correct one after this switcheroo.p  pHas anyone else encountered and  or solved thisp  pUPDATE Tried removing and adding all splash images again but to no avail. I tried removing the smaller images the 4 and its nonretina version but even without the smaller ones present anywhere in the project I get the same errorp  pUPDATE 2 Cordova 2.2.0 has now been released, thus fixing this issue according to a hrefhttpshazronatadobe.wordpress.com20121027whatsnewincordovaios220httpshazronatadobe.wordpress.com20121027whatsnewincordovaios220ap  pSo, the recommended solution would therefore be to update your app to use Cordova 2.2.0, if that is for some reason not possible, solutions are provided below.p

This seems to be the case, since we have been creating migrations for the past 3 years and running them successfully. It appears that Rails is saying Youre officially migrated to version 20090409010513002, but havent yet run migration something in 2012, so Ill run that and add it to the database.p  pMy question is twofoldp  ol liIs there any hidden danger to the emstatus quoem Things seem to be working well enough, but I want to know they will continue to do so.li liSince those extralong migration numbers dont actually have migration files attached to them there is a file for 20090409010513, but neither for the 001 or 002 versions, is there any harm at all in deleting these rows, thereby having Rails realize the true latest migrationli ol

Negative 4209 pI need to implement a background process in an iOS app, that performs a job every 60 seconds. I know this can only be done while the app is in focus, but I do want this job to finish running in the background after the app is closed. I will use GCD to dispatch a timer that calls my job asynchronously every 60 seconds using either codedispatchasynccode or codebeginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandlercode.p  pI am wondering which method is the best, or if they are essentially the same. Is it okay to use codebeginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandlercode to execute a job even while the app is in the foreground Or am I better off trying to cancel the job when the app state changes, and then restart the job as a background taskp

Negative 4209 pI just tried implementing code in Java for various means by which the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence can be computed and Im hoping to verify what Ive learnt.p  pThe iterative implementation is as followsp  precodepublic int iterativeFibonacciint n    if  n  1  return 0   else if  n  2  return 1   int i  0, j  1, sum  0   for   n2  0 n         sum  i  j     i  j     j  sum      return sum  codepre  pThe recursive implementation is as follows p  precode  public int recursiveFibonacciint n        if  n  1  return 0     else if  n  2  return 1     return recursiveFibonaccin1  recursiveFibonaccin2    codepre  pThe memoized implementation is as follows p  precode  public int memoizedFibonacciint n        if  n lt 0  return 1     else if  n  1  return 0     else if  n  2  return 1     if  memory[n1]  0        memory[n1]  memoizedFibonaccin1     if  memory[n2]  0        memory[n2]  memoizedFibonaccin2     return memory[n1]memory[n2]    codepre  pIm having a bit of a doubt when trying to figure out the BigO of these implementations. I believe the emiterative implementation to be Onem as it loops through N2 times.p  pIn the recursive function, there are values recomputed, hence I think its emOn2em.p  pIn the memoized function, more than half of the values are accessed based on memoization. Ive read that eman algorithm is Olog N if it takes constant time to reduce the problem space by a fractionem and that eman algorithm is ON if it takes constant time to reduce the problem space by a constant amountem. Am I right in believing that the memoized implementation is emOnem in complexity If so, wouldnt the iterative implementation be the best among all three as it does not use the additional memory that memoization requires.p
Negative 4209 pI got this line into a macro definition of a class p  precodevirtual const char GetEventName const      return classname  codepre  pWhat is happening in this function and its return typep
Negative 4209 pFollowing this a hrefhttpwww.liquidtechnologies.comTutorialsXmlSchemasXsdTutorial04.aspx relnofollowtutoriala Ive refactored my 733 line schema into 16 separate files or subschemas, each with its own namespace. Now the top level schema is just 77 lines. The plan is to use these subschemas to build other toplevel schemas.p  pThe problem is that most top level schemas are quite similar and only differ in a few low level details. For example while one top level schema supports all codePaymentMethodTypecodes see a hrefhttpwww.liquidtechnologies.comTutorialsXmlSchemasXsdTutorial04.aspx relnofollowtutoriala another toplevel schema may support only VISA and MasterCard. Currently my method of creating toplevel schemas involves considerable duplication. For example, my current method of creating a toplevel schema in which only VISA and MasterCard are supported would involve duplicating codeMain.xsdcode and codeOrderType.xsdcode, but customizing codeCommonTypes.xsdcode and reuse codeCustomerTypes.xsdcode. As my actual schema is a lot longer a lot more duplication is involved.p  pI find this duplication unacceptable primarily because it introduces a maintenance challenge i.e. I would have to maintain any number of identical subschemas with different names.p  pWhat I would like to know is if there is a method of automatically generating a schema without via a config file of some sort XSLT perhaps, in order to avoid duplicating subschemas.p  pAlso, is it good practice for all the subschemas to declare the same target namespace in this case just like the xml schema namespace codexscode, but have custom subschemas declare a separate namespacep

Negative 4209 pI have two threads, Reader and Writer.p  pThe Writer gets data from the network and sends it then over a socket to some executable. When this is done the writer should block up to 70 seconds which I specify with a Event.waitaskrate. p  pThis should give the executable enough time to compute the result and then submit the output. If the computation is finished I used Event.set to release the lock on the Writer thread so that it can read the next data that is forwared to the executeable and so on.p  pThe problem that I have is, that the Writer thread still keeps reading data while the Reader thread is waiting for the result coming through the serial interface. p  pAnyone an idea why this blocking meachnism is not proberly working between these two threadsp  precodeaskrate  70  s  socket.socketsocket.AFUNIX, socket.SOCKSTREAM s.connecttmpdemosocket  class ReaderThread     def initself         Thread.initself         self.daemon  True      def runself         while True                         nonce  s.recv4                         if lennonce  4                 submitter  Submitterwriter.block, nonce                 submit result and release thread lock in Writer class                  golden.set  class WriterThread     def initself         Thread.initself         self.daemon  True      def runself         while True           work  bc.getwork                           self.block  work[data]           self.midstate  work[midstate]            payload  self.midstate.decodehex  self.block.decodehex           s.sendpayload           result  golden.waitaskrate            if result              golden.clear   golden  Event  reader  Reader writer  Writer  reader.start writer.start  codepre

But because my code is in seperate class library projects, the MyCompany.MyProject.Repository for example cannot access it even though my Namespaces follow suit.p  pThis doesnt seem to fit my understanding of encapsulation, what am I doing wrong herep  pYour help is much appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Within the project something goes wrong with the SSL handshake this code is executed within OpenSSL. p  pThough I have built the libraries libcrypto.a and libssl.a using the build script from x2on and added these libraries to my project I am unable to step into calls to OpenSSL methods from within my own project.p  pAlso I could not discover any relevant setting which is present in the demo app from x2on when I compare the settings with my own app. If I try to step into the OpenSSL call, then execution just moves on to the next line I do not get into .asm code and also not in the OpenSSL code. Also if I use the right mouse button and choose Jump to Definition it brings me to the OpenSSL header file instead of the implementation .c. p  pCould somebody give some hints here How is stepping into supposed to work in general Do the libraries .a contains a reference to the location of the source code Where can you set the search path for source code in XCode How can you enforce that XCode will reindex the code including the OpenSSL code and make Jump to Definition workp  pAny help is appreciated as I did discover more people who are or have been struggling with this problem.p  pADDITION I created a small test app, added libcrypto.a and libssl.a to the Frameworks folder and included the path to the header files for OpenSSL into the Build Settings  Header Search Paths. No problem to step into a piece of OpenSSL codemethods ... However, when I apply the same strategy to my huge project, then it steps over the OpenSSL call instead of stepping into the OpenSSL call ... I heard that each project should reference a static library only once If the project references a static library multiple times, then would this break the functionality to step into the code of that library ...p  pForgot to add for the small test app there was no need to indicate the location of the source files for OpenSSL. So my tentative conclusion is that the .a libs contain a reference to the source files for OpenSSL how could XCode otherwise know the location of the source files.p  pTo share some further information both in my huge project and in the test application it is not possible to jump to the source code by selecting Jump to Definition. So stepping into the code and Jump to Definition seemare unrelated.p
Negative 4209 pSo Ive been looking into effective ways to take the load off of my database in my ASP.NET application, and Ive run into the codeSystem.Web.Mvc.OutputcCacheAttributecode.  Ive used caching based on codeSystem.Web.HttpRuntime.Cachecode before, it seems to be pretty much functionally equivalent. Ive done a lot of research on it, and everything Ive seen portrays it as some sort of silver bullet for caching requests as long as you configure it effectively.  I find this hard to believe.  I understand that all it really takes to a degree for some effective caching is storing the output data based on certain conditions, but it still just seems too easy to just tack on an attribute and have your application magically perform better.p  pHas anyone had any experience with the benefitsdrawbacks of using Output Caching in ASP.NET  If so, what are the pain points of using this approach to cachingp

Negative 4209 pI know there is probably an answer already to this question but I havent been able to find it yet and there is a deadline on my project.p  pSo I have made an html5 canvas and I would like to be able to do two things with oneor more buttons. I would like the user to be able to save what he has just done by clicking on the save button and ideally I would like the image to be downloaded as opposed to having to right click and Save image as. This is what I have been able to do so far.  I would also like the image to be saved maybe to a database or a server I dont know how it works so that a part of the drawing or all of it, depending on the difficulty of the code that has been done before is used the next time someone else logs on not necessarily the same person with the same IP. Is this possible p  pI am very new to code and self teaching myself so any extra comments on the code to help me understand would be extraappreciated. p
Negative 4209 pIm writing a Chrome extension that blocks possibly offensive content. One method that I am implementing is to scan all the images and see how much skin is showing. I create a new image object, set the crossOrigin flag to  , then make a onload function that will draw the image onto the canvas, read the data from the canvas, and then perform the analysis, setting a boolean flag for the calling function. After defining the onload function, I assign a src to my image node from my list of sources from the webpage. The imagescanner function is called inside of a for loop that is looping through each image node on the webpage and performing various operations to block on. This is the last operation that I perform. Here is the code that calls imagescannerp  precode                if imagescanneroptions.scannersensitivity, images[i]                                  Replace the image with a blank white image                images[i].src  chrome.extension.getURLreplacement.png                    codepre  pHere is the imagescanner functionp  precode    function imagescannersensitivity, image              Sensitivity is a number and image is an image node.         Declare a variable to count the number of skin pixels       var skincount  0        if image.width  0 ampamp image.height 0                This means the image has no size and we cannot block it.        return false         end if         var returnvalue  null  set bool flag        Create an HTML5 canvas object.    var canvas  document.createElementcanvas        window.alertCreated Canvas.  used for testing.         Get the context for the canvas.       var context  canvas.getContext2d  This is what we actually use to draw images and pull the data from them.        context.canvas.width  image.width  Set the canvas width to the width of the image       context.canvas.height  image.height  Set the canvas height to the height of the image         img  new Image  Create a new image node to circumvent crossdomain restrictions.       img.crossOrigin     Set crossOrigin flag to   so we can extract data from it.        img.onload  function           window.alertimg.src  This always gives the same src until Chrome ends the function           context.drawImagethis, 0,0  Draw the image onto the canvas.            var pixels  context.getImageData0, 0, image.width, image.height.data              Now pixels is an array where every four entries in the array is the RGBa for a single pixel.            So pixels[0] is the R value for the first pixel, pixels[1] is the G value for the first pixel,            pixels[2] is the B value for the first pixel, and pixels[3] is the a alpha or transparency value for the first pixel.             This means that pixels.length4 is the number of pixels in the image.            Now we calculate the number of skin pixels we can have before blocking the image.           var limit  pixels.length4  sensitivity100             Now we go through the array of pixel data, checking if each pixel is a skin colored pixel based on its RGB value the first 3 entries for that pixel in the pixels array            Each time we find a skin colored pixel, we increment skincount and check if skincount gt limit. If so, we return true.           for var i  0 i lt pixels.length i  4  We go up by four since every four entries describes 1 pixel                         pixel is skin if 0 lt RGRG  lt .5  and BRG lt .5 pixels[i] is the R value, pixels[i1] is the G value, and pixels[i2] is the B value.            if 0 lt pixels[i]  pixels[i1]pixels[i]  pixels[i1] ampamp pixels[i]  pixels[i1]pixels[i]  pixels[i1] lt 0.5 ampamp pixels[i2]pixels[i]  pixels[i1] lt 0.5                            skincount                window.alertFound skin pixel.  used for testing.                 if skincount gt limit                                    window.alertBlocking image with src   image.src  used for testing.                    img.onload  null  try to clear the onload function                    returnvalue  true                    return false                  end inner if              end outer if             end for loop         var temp        img.onload  null        returnvalue  false        return false          end onload function      img.src  image.src  Set the new image to the same url as the old one.           return returnvalue   end imagescanner codepre  pIm not sure what the problem is, but the onload function will run, go through the pixels, set the flag, return, and then run again. Ive tried debugging in Chromes debugger, and thats all I could find. Ive tried setting the onload to null inside of the onload function, but it doesnt work. Ive tried returning false from the onload function. Ive tried waiting in the imagescanner function until returnvalue  null, but that just seemed to enter an infinite loop and I never even got the alert from the onload function. If anyone has any idea why the onload function will repeatedly execute, I would be very grateful.p

Negative 4209 pI have a script that should add accordion functionality to a vertical menu. I mainly used code from a hrefhttpjoaopinho.blogspot.de201211sharepoint2013accordionquicklaunch.htmlm1 relnofollowthis bloga. The menu I made consists of multiple levels, the example I made in a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxMoshiiwxu6f relnofollowthis jsFiddlea is only 3 levels deep but I plan on using more it is a requirement for my client. brbr When an element has the class selected, I want only that element and its parents to be shown as soon as the page loads. In the example that element is colored green, but the parents of that element should of course also be shown. When a user selects a different element to expand, it should hide the first one and show the content of the element that has just been clicked.  brbr Please take a look at the example first, and try it out a bit. Then compare it to the below. br This is how the menu should like like in the first place, as soon as the page loadsp  precode     Site 1          Site 1, page 1          Site 1, page 2          Site 1, subsite 1              Site 1, subsite 1, page 1              Site 1, subsite 1, page 2          Site 1, subsite 2          Site 1, page 3      Site 2 codepre  pSo as you can see, the only things that should be immediately visible are the elements that contain the class selected in the HTML. All the rest should be simply collapsed. Of course, as soon as a user clicks on another subsite, or on Site 1 or Site 2, it should collapse the current one which has selected, and open up the other element that has been clicked. The behavior it has now is absolutely not what I intended it to be, Ive been trying around a lot but no success so far.  brbr I cannot quite manage to see how I could fix this. Ive been trying to make it work since last week and Im still stuck. Therefore I would really appreciate it if someone could take a look and tell me what Im doing wrong and why it behaves like that.br br Some additional information this menu will be used in a SharePoint 2013 environment, it will replace the SharePoint Quick Launch menu. p  pbr Thanks in advance for your timep  hr  pstrongEDITstrongbr In case the jsFiddle becomes unavailable, here is the

Negative 4209 pThe question is how can I get screen resolution in iOS MonoTouch like codeUIScreen.MainScreen.Boundscode without a UI thread  The property code.MainScreencode throws an exceptionp  precodeUIKit Consistency error you are calling a UIKit method that can only be invoked from the UI thread. codepre  pThus I need a UI thread. But since the resolution is needed before the application is loaded, before codeUIApplication.Maincode gets called, codeUIApplication.mainThreadcode a private member, shown by the debugger is codenullcode. I assume there is no UI thread at all since there is no UI. So I technically can not call codeInvokeOnMainThreadcode on any object.p  pIs there any other way to obtain screen resolution without codeUIScreen.MainScreencode If not, I will have to move initialization to some code invoked from UI. Then theres another question how do I get any UI object to call codeInvokeOnMainThreadcode from arbitrary thread I do not have control over the UI code.p

This worked, however, when the strongteetimesfrommysqlstrong was SELECTed from my MYSQL database, it only took the most recently booked tee time only one and excluded that....the rest got ignored or simply were never fetched, not sure....so it doesnt work if there is more than one booked tee time which there is obviously going to be more than that....my question is how do I exclude a time if they equal any of times in the database.p  precodefor istartHour i lt endHour i      for j  0 j lt 55 j5              timepre  i..strpadj, 2, 0, STRPADLEFT         time  .timepre . .day.                    timeformatedforcosmetic  dategi a, strtotimetime         timeformatedformysql  dateYmd His, strtotimetime           if time  teetimesfrommysql             time                     else             time  ltoption value . timeformatedformysql . gt.timeformatedforcosmetic .ltoptiongt                  echo time       codepre  h1THIS IS MY MYSQL FETCH ALSOh1  precodeteetimesfrommysql    sql  SELECT  FROM teetimes query  mysqliquerydbconx, sql whilerow  mysqlifetchassocquery     teetimesfrommysql  row[datetime]     teetimesfrommysql   dateGi njy, strtotimeteetimesfrommysql       codepre

Negative 4209 pI am new to bitwise operators. I understand how the logic functions work to get the final result. For example, when you bitwise AND two numbers, the final result is going to be the AND of those two numbers 1amp0  0 1amp1  1 0amp0  0. Same with OR, XOR, and NOT. What I dont understand is their application. I tried looking everywhere and most of them just explain how bitwise operations work. Of all the bitwise operators I only understand the application of shift operators multiplication and division. I also came across masking. I understand that masking is done using bitwise AND but what exactly is its purpose and where and how can I use it Can you elaborate on how I can use masking Are there similar uses for OR and XOR p

Negative 4209 pI have a simple base form that has no UI controls in the design view. I have declared few textbox controls that have protected modifier and are used in both the parent code behind and as UI controls in the design view of the sub class that inherits the parent class. p  pBasically you see an empty form in the parent classs design view and a form with controls in the sub classs design view. The application compiles and runs as expected.p  pThe problem is I keep getting ap  precodeNo context registered. Use the RegisterContext method or the springcontext section from your configuration file codepre  pwhen I try to open up the form. I know this was working a week ago. I did play around a bit with Spring.NET configurations but I am sure I have reverted everything back. If there was a problem that would show up during runtime anyway. p  pI debugged with another instance of VS to see what the problem is and it shows an issue as Spring.NET not being able to resolve a baseDao class. If I let the subclass inherit from System.Windows.Forms  only, there is no issue opening the the sub class in the design view. This is very strange. I did however manage to create another base class with a different name and subclass it. I have tried deleting the files from the solution and removed the references inside the project file. That did not help. Now if I rename the files, that wont work either. p  pCan anyone suggest anything here VB.NET  Visual Studio 2008. The base form inherits from DevExpress Form v 11.1p  pstrongEDITstrong Its got nothing to do with DevExpress controls as changing the base form to inherit Windows.Forms.Form makes no differencep

Negative 4209 pIf a SQLite database using writeahead logging is interrupted with uncheckpointed transactions due to a power failure or whatever, then reopened with the temporary wal file missing, will the database open cleanly to its state as of the last checkpoint, or will it be corrupted in some wayp  pWere trying to get SQLite working with iCloud yes, we know youre not supposed to do that, but we also make a Windows and an Android app and need a crossplatform database solution, and we think that WAL provides a potential way to avoid having to maintain two copies of our database  wed keep the wal file outside of iCloud but store the main database in it, thus avoiding the problem of iCloud backing up rollback journals or backing up databases midtransaction without those journals.p

Now I am working with a pretty large database in Oracle and was asked to explore it a little bit on the development side to get more familiar.p  pOne of the questions that was sent to me to explore the db involved finding a list of Run Controls that are associated with a particular user.p  pThere is a single table that keeps track of the different types of Run Controls that exist via a field titled coderuncntlidcode. There are 18 rows in this table associated with the specific user, each with a unique coderuncntlidcode.  For each of the values in the coderuncntlidcode field, there is at least one corresponding table with multiple rows pretty standard database stuff.  Unfortunately, I do not have any reference material to display the table relationships.p  pThere are just under 3,000 tables that contain both the codeopridcode the user identifier and the coderuncntlidcode the type of Run Control fields when they are separated, there are 3,100 tables that contain the coderuncntlidcode field, and 8,800 that contain the codeopridcode field.  There are approximately 65,000 total tables in the database.

Therefore it should make any row with the msgread  0  green. this is only working for the first row of the table with the code i have  i verified that it is always getting a 0 value, however it only works the first time through in the while statement .. p  precoderequire.connect.php  getmessages  SELECT  FROM messages WHERE toperson   . userid .   echo getmessages  messages  mysqlquerygetmessages  ifmysqlnumrowsmessages  0       table  lttablegtlttrgtltthgtFromltthgtltthgtSubjectltthgtltthgtMessageltthgtlttrgt      whileresults  mysqlfetcharraymessages           ifstrlenresults[message] lt 30             message  results[message]                  else              message  substrresults[message], 0 ,30 . ...                   ifresults[msgread]  0              table . lttr stylebackground9CFFB6gt             table . lttdgt . results[from] . lttdgtlttdgt . results[subject] . lttdgtlttdgtlta hrefviewmessage.phpid . results[messageid] .gt . message . ltagtlttdgtlttrgt                  else              table . lttrgt             table . lttdgt . results[from] . lttdgtlttdgt . results[subject] . lttdgtlttdgtlta hrefviewmessage.phpid . results[messageid] .gt . message . ltagtlttdgtlttrgt                    echo table .lttablegt  else      echo No Messages Found     codepre  pTheres all the code, including grabbing the info from  the database.

Negative 4209 pIm having issues with my implementation of the overloaded  operator for a linked list. The List class contains a codeNode headcode pointer and a codestruct Nodecode containing codeT datacode and codeNode nextcode, where T is a template typename. Im having trouble with what is happening at the end of the operator function where the destructor in this case handled by codemakeEmptycode is being called twice by the end of the operator, once after iterating through the list and creating a new list of the same nodes and once after the operator function exits.p  pHere is the makeEmpty implementationp  precode Does the work of the Destructor template lttypename Tgt void ListltTgtmakeEmpty   cout ltlt endl ltlt endl ltlt DESTRUCTOR CALLED ltlt endl ltlt endl ListltTgtNode tempPtr  head  if head  NULL       ListltTgtNode nextPtr  headgtnext      for          if tempPtr  NULL               delete tempPtrgtdata             tempPtr  nextPtr              if nextPtr  NULL                 nextPtr  nextPtrgtnext              tempPtr  headgtnext             delete head             head  tempPtr                   else break         codepre  pHere is the operator overload implementationp  precode Overloaded to be able to assign one list to another template lttypename Tgt ListltTgt ListltTgtoperatorconst Listamp listToCopy   ListltTgt listToReturn listToReturn.head  NULL ListltTgtNode copyPtr  listToCopy.head  ListltTgtNode thisPtr  head  if copyPtr  NULL ampamp thisPtr  NULL      for          if copyPtr  NULL               T toInsert  new TcopyPtrgtdata             listToReturn.inserttoInsert              copyPtr  copyPtrgtnext                   elsecout ltlt endl ltlt listToReturn ltlt endl ltlt endl return listToReturn        if righthand list is NULL, return an empty list return listToReturn  codepre  pIve been debugging for a little bit and it seems that the second time the destructor is called, the head of the list being destroyed contains unreadable memory. Im not even sure why the destructor is being called twice within the operator since the only list that needs to be destroyed is the listToReturn after it has been returned. maybe my logic is flawed somewhere... Ive just been thinking about this for too longp  pIf you guys need anymore info about the code, Id be glad to provide. As usual, this is for an assignment, so Im only asking for tips that may help me get in the right direction. So thanks to everyone for looking and helpingp

Negative 4209 pHi I need to develop a fully functional IM solution like viber or whatsapp for android. It will have the basic chat features plus many more. Can any one direct me on this. I dont want to re invent the wheel so my target is to use the existing thing as much as possible for the chat server etc some thing like jabber. If one can direct me for this, or give me some good advice for this it will be a great help.p  pEdit   I will extend the application future to allow other platform clients like Windows Mobile or iOS clients. In that sense what would be the best technology to implement the server It must handle real time traffic well. Will I be able to wrap or extend some sort of a XAMPP server to  get my work donep

It says that there was a segfault at the address after the last instruction for the code.  i.e. if The last line has an address of 0x804807c then the segmentation fault happens at 0x804807e before any of the code has a chance to run.p  pCould any one point me in the right direction so I can figure out how to fix thisp

As it turned out it didnt even compile for me and others. GCC 4.8.1 gave an error due to redeclaration of a variable with name codebsearchcode, which happens to be identical to a function name in codestdcode. This resulted in a clash as the code also used codeusing namespace stdcode.

If what I describe is true please correct me otherwise, then it seems to me this buildingup and expandingagain model is not efficient.  Why does the expansion need to be done like this  Is it possible to finish the expansion by a run down the template once and for allp

Negative 4209 pIve been trying to figure out this issue with my website for a while nowI have a bunch of stars a user can click on.p  pclicking on a star loads a file into a div with information regarding that star. It also loads a button for the players to click and Take over the planet. That all is working well and fine, howeverIve recently discovered an issue that Im not quite sure how to handle. p  pIF a player clicks on multiple stars before reloading the page for whatever reasonwhen the click to attackwhatever the staritll send multiple requests across the server.

Then I figured, maybe its the way the code was being calledI originally had two seperate functions one for attack, one for colonizing. both of which were being called in the fullStarInformation function, So I moved it all down to one function, im still getting the issue. p  pAFAIK, right now, i may have to rewrite this entire block of code so that the colony function and the starInformation function are separate and not acting upon one another. But I wanted to get a second, third maybe even fourth set of eyes on the code before I go about doing that.p

Negative 4209 pI am pretty new with this. I am trying to develop some android application in QtQml to query and update data to a database.p  pstrongThe problem Im trying to solvestrongp  pThere is a server with a MySQL database. The android application request some data. I use a very very basic php file that query in the database, format an XML and show that file starting with a codeheaderContenttype textxmlcode sentence, then some codeecho lt...gtcode sentences. This php file receives parameters via codeGETcode array and performs the query.p  pThis is a little archaic but works fine. My client application use QtQML for android. It uses codeXmlListModelcode to obtain the data from the server and show that data in a codeListViewcode.p  pSo far so good, but here is my real problemp  pThe user of the android application can change some data, and the modified data must be sent back to the server, who performs an update in the database.p  pMy first attempt was to create another php file and send the data in the URI, get it via codeGETcode and perform the update to the database. This works but there could be many variables and the URI will become very large. I think might be better to send an XML or JSON from the client to the server, and put in that file the data for the update.p  pstrongSo, this is the questionstrong How can I send an XML file from QtQML to the server How does the php file obtain that data Or maybe there is another, better way for doing this.p  pEvery example I find just shows the servertoclient part, or is written in Java, and I dont know java enough.p  pAdditional notesp  ul liAfter I can solve this I will fight with security SSL, avoiding SQL injection or anything, but that will be in another question if necessary.li liI didnt use SOAP or similar because the first ideas was simple. Also, I have never used SOAP before. If this is the emrightem way, I would be very grateful if you show me how to use it from QtQML in android.li liOf course, I can use C for the client application since it is using Qt.li liI use Qt since I already know it and the app might be useful in desktop as well.li ul  pSorry if I made any english mistake. Thank you in advance.p

It works fine when I do it using normal x,y coordinates, but when using the polar coordinates, the color get wrong...p  pLets say my data is test.txtp  precode15 0.2 60 30 0.1 50 35 0.4 10 60 0.2 70 90 0.3 12 120 0.2 5 codepre  pIf I dop  precodeset palette defined  0 red, 1 yellow, 2 cyan, 3 blue, 4 magenta set cbrange [080] set xrange [0180] plot test.txt u 123 with impulses lw 2 lc palette codepre  pIts all goodp  pBut if I use the same palette and I dop  precodeset polar set angles degrees set xrange[00.5] set yrange[0.50.5] plot test.txt u 123 with impulses lw 2 lc palette codepre  pI get a nice polar coordinates graph but not with the right color for my impulses... Whats wrong with this Ive seen post explaining how to color impulses which are using lc variable or lc var z, but it did not work with my polar data... Thanks in advance for the help.p
Negative 4209 pMy goal is to make an Android app that displays traditional Mongolian. However, Mongolian is displayed vertically, even though the font writes it horizontally like English. Thus, if I print it on the screen in portrait mode I have to hold the phone as if it were in landscape mode in order to read it properly and vice versa.p  pIve seen a lot of questions about forcing it into one mode or another by adding a line like one the following to the AndroidManifest.xml file p  precodeandroidscreenOrientationlandscape  androidscreenOrientationportrait  codepre  pbut I want to dynamically switch between both orientations, just opposite from what you would normally want.p  pIf there is a better solution, then I am open to that, too. Ive tried things like setting p  precodeandroidrotation90  codepre  pin the views xml, but it wasnt displaying correctly for even one view, let alone multiple view objects. I also saw solutions for rotating individual views with canvas, but that seemed more complex than just reversing the orientation, since everything needs to be rotated including TextViews, Buttons, ListViews, etc.p  pUPDATE I finally chose an answer because I wasnt getting any other answers. Im still not sure how to implement it. My plan now is just to allow users to select a fixed orientation in settings.p

Negative 4209 pI have searched for solution for this problem for a while now and cant seem to find anything relevant. Is it possible to change column labels titles in table via VBA. The only way I find to do it is to create query based on table with parameters as SQL aliases. However it adds some more elements to my already complex data base, it is something I want to avoid. I do not want to change column names. Is there any solution to this problem or should I leave it as it is nowp  pThanks for the time you took reading this and for answersp
Negative 4209 pBonjour everyone,p  pCurrently, the script below is on my server as a PHP page pull.php.

Negative 4209 pfairly new to git here. I would like to ask what you think is the best way to implement the following source code management process with git or other SCM systemsp  blockquote   ul   lipBefore committing code for certain parts of the system i.e.  system framework, changes must be reviewed first by the assigned reviewer. The reviewer is then notified afterwards. strongemOr preferablyemstrong a set of reviewers do not need to be notified, they should have a way to view pending changes on the whole system which they can assign to each of themselves for review.pli   lipThe reviewer then pulls the code changes from some location and reviews it.pli   lipIf the reviewer finds the code acceptable he commits it himself to the central repository, else simply removes the file from the list of files for review. The developer who has set the change for review is notified afterwards.pli   ul blockquote  pWhat we have thought of so farp  ul liUse git. Changes of developers must be committed to their local repository for review.li liThe reviewer pulls the changes from the remote repository of the developer above.li liThe reviewer then decides the fate of the change, whether to commit or scrap it.li ul  pWe thought the above approach is too tedious to the review. For one, he needs to save the repository of each developer that will be reviewed and secondly, he needs to find the file for review in the whole remote repository.p  pSo we then changed it to something like thisp  ul liStill use git. Changes for review of developers must be committed to the remote repository of the reviewer. This repository should only contain files for review.li liThe reviewer then compares his current copy of the file and the newest one which was committed by the developer above.li liThe reviewer then decides the fate of the change, whether to commit or scrap it.li ul  pStill, this does not eliminate the effort to manually commit the reviewed changes to the central repository. Any better suggestions Thanks.p

Negative 4209 pBackgroundp  pI have an ASP.NET web app configured for federation with AD FS. Im using VS 2012, and have TFS for source control, builds and deployments.p  pWere currently deploying by copying the built files from the build server TFS to the alpha environment. From there we would copy from alpha to beta, then from beta to production. So there is not a unique build for each environment. The way were handling environmentspecific settings right now is there is one config file that has all the settings for each environment Lets call this EnvironmentSpecificSettings.config Ill refer to it below. There is a static file on each server that indicates which environment the server should be in, and so when that config file is read in, the matching settings can be applied.p  pThe problemp  pThe ADFS configuration is handled in the web.config. There are a few things that are specific to the environment. How might I handle this within my current deployment paradigm I had a couple of ideasp  ol liinclude a file reference in the web.config that reads in a static environmentspecific file that would not be part of the deployment.li liTry to pull something off in ApplicationStart that would read in settings from EnvironmentSpecificSettings.config mentioned above and alter the web.config.li liTry to tweak the configuration of the WSFederationAuthenticationModule at runtimeli ol  pthe first idea 1 is less than optimal because it requires files hanging around outside of source control and outside of deployments, however it should work easily enough. Next, 2 I kinda think isnt possible. Im not sure you can change your web.config like I am hoping, but maybe Finally, 3 Is only reasonable because Im in a special situation where Im not doing regular passive authentication, instead Im manually redirecting to adfs, so I have a chance to change settings, such as injecting the whr parameter to avoid HRD. So, it might be possible, however, Im not sure how or if you can change some of these values on the fly such as thumbprint, or wsFederation issuer or realm.p  pDoes anyone have any better ideas or experience in handling environmentspecific settings without doing the visual studio web deploys with transformsp

From the code, its based on some bufferized class, but I dont see any further docs on that.p  pI have a crazy idea to create an explicit cache and replace open methods with it  so it will read the file in bigger chunks, say, by 8MB, and then perform splitting it by lines.

Negative 4209 pI was expecting to see the same results between these two runs, and they are different.

Negative 4209 pAfter upgrading my Grails project from 1.3.7 to 2.4.0 and after fixing various issues related to the new grails version, I realized that none of the changes done to any object would be persisted anymore at all except if codesaveflushtruecode is called.p  pWith Grails 1.3.7 the default behavior when saving a domain instance using codesavecode is that changes get persisted automatically, due to hibernate flushMode  codeFlushMode.AUTOcode. In Grails 2.4.0 this is not true anymore. The default flushMode of the hibernate session inside any controller action or service class is codeFlushMode.MANUALcode.p  pThings get even stranger when retrieving codesessionFactory.currentSession.flushModecode in BootStrap, where it has a value of codeFlushMode.AUTOcode and in a controller action where it has the value codeFlushMode.MANUALcode. This can be verified by creating a new grails app and putting codeprintln flushMode  sessionFactory.currentSession.flushModecode in BootStrap and in a controller action eg. index.p  pI have been searching through all kind of forums for the last 2 days and did not find any reasonable explanation why this had to be changed in Grails 2.4.0 or maybe even in earlier versions. I only found comments saying its kind of risky to have codeFlushMode.MANUALcode because you may run into stale objects when querying the db after some others have been modified.p  pI know thatp  ul liwith codegrails.gorm.autoFlush  truecode in config you can force a flushtrue to every saveli liin hibernate3 and hibernate4 default flushMode is codeFlushMode.AUTOcodeli liits not possible to set flushMode in Config.groovy nor in DataSource.groovy.

Negative 4209 pfollowing situation I got a splashscreen which has to fade in over 2 seconds from transparent to opaque. While the window nicely fades in, the program should wait until it is fully visible the Storyboard finished and then it should continue doing its stuff. While the window is fading in, the user should already see the animations of the control so blocking the UI thread is not an option, of course. And with animations I mean the loading circle which spins happily.p  pAfter I found a nice variant of how to fade in and out a window with WPFs storyboards, I tried to accomplish this by using the EventWaitHandle. As my intialization routine already runs asynchronous I was able to use it. This blocked the worker thread and stopped my application doing the initialization stuff before the Splashscreen was fully visible. But somehow this has been broken after a while and it doesnt seem to be the best solution.p  pHeres how Im doing it, currentlyp  precodepublic async Task Appeardouble time      Core.IDE.GetGUICore.GetUIDispatcher.Invoke gt              this.Opacity  0         this.Show          fadeInStoryboard  new Storyboard         fadeInStoryboard.Completed  this.FadeInAnimation         DoubleAnimation fadeInAnimation  new DoubleAnimation0.0, 1.0, new DurationTimeSpan.FromSecondstime         Storyboard.SetTargetfadeInAnimation, this         Storyboard.SetTargetPropertyfadeInAnimation, new PropertyPathOpacityProperty         fadeInStoryboard.Children.AddfadeInAnimation           currentHandle  new EventWaitHandlefalse, EventResetMode.AutoReset     Core.IDE.GetGUICore         .GetUIDispatcher         .InvokeAsyncthis.fadeInStoryboard.Begin, DispatcherPriority.Render     currentHandle.WaitOne    ltsummarygt  Hides the SplashScreen with a fadeout animation.  ltsummarygt  ltparam nametimegtThe fadeout time in seconds.ltparamgt public void Disappeardouble time      Core.IDE.GetGUICore.GetUIDispatcher.Invoke gt              fadeOutStoryboard  new Storyboard         fadeOutStoryboard.Completed  this.FadeOutAnimation         DoubleAnimation fadeOutAnimation  new DoubleAnimation1.0, 0.0,             new DurationTimeSpan.FromSecondstime         Storyboard.SetTargetfadeOutAnimation, this         Storyboard.SetTargetPropertyfadeOutAnimation, new PropertyPathOpacityProperty         fadeOutStoryboard.Children.AddfadeOutAnimation           Core.IDE.GetGUICore        .GetUIDispatcher        .BeginInvokenew ActionfadeOutStoryboard.Begin, DispatcherPriority.Render, null   private void FadeInAnimationobject sender, EventArgs e      currentHandle.Set   private void FadeOutAnimationobject sender, EventArgs e      this.Hide  codepre  pIs this the right approach Any better solutions Any ideas why it is broken By the way, with broken I mean that the application continues doing its initialization stuff whilst the window is fading in, which ends in an animation which runs until its probably at 30 visibility and then fading out because the main window already showed up.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4209 pI have a stored procedure in SQL Server 2008 which takes an array as an input param. According to a hrefhttpwww.sommarskog.searraysinsql2008.html relnofollowhttpwww.sommarskog.searraysinsql2008.htmla, I shall use TVP. However this is not supported in MSSQL JDBC driver. Therefore I cannot use SimpleJdbcCall to execute the stored procedure as I cannot pass the array parameter. I turned back to use JdbcTemplate to call this procedure like belowp  precodeStringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder sb.appenddeclare d objecturltype sb.appendinsert into d values 0, httpexample.com, index.html,  sb.appendinsert into d values 0, httpexample.com, help.html,  sb.appendexec procedurename objsd, id123 jdbcTemplate.querysb.toString, new BeanPropertyRowMapperObjectData.class codepre  pThe problem I have is that the stored procedure returns two result sets. But it seems like I can only retrieve the first result set using jdbcTemplate. If I can use SimpleJdbcCall it would be easy to decare two result sets but unfortunately I cannot use it. I googled a lot but cannot find any solution to this problem. Can anyone pls help me on this I guess I shall go back to use the raw JDBC way.p
Negative 4209 pI have implemented a JSSOR slider into my responsive redesign on my website. You can view it a hrefhttpwww.westshore.eduresponsiveindex.html relnofollowherea. p  pAt first, I had an issue with the slider responding to an orientation change on iPhones and iPads. Through a little research I found that I had to add a orientationchange command to fix it. p  pAfter I got that working I tried doing orientation changes on a Windows phone and an Android phone. The resizing does not work on either of these devices. p  pI thought that the resize command was supposed to take care of it.p  pThe code that I think is the issue is thisp  pScaleSliderp  precode        if navigator.userAgent.matchiPhoneiPodiPadBlackBerryIEMobileAndroid              window.bindresize, ScaleSlider                  else            window.bindorientationchange, ScaleSlider          codepre
Negative 4209 pIm currently planning a class with some conversion functions. I just wonder when I have to overload the cast operator of a class. When I have a conversion constructor codeABamp bcode then as far as I see whenever I need to convert a B into an A, i could just use the conversion constructor.p  pExamplesp  precodeB b, c, d A a  b  conversion constructor automatically called a  Ac  could also overload assignment operator functionofaAd  can equally write this as functionofaAd codepre  pCurrently I plan to use just a conversion constructor, whereas I do not see any purpose of an overloaded cast operator and I also plan to INTENTIONALLY NOT overload the assignment operator for A  B to make the conversion more obvious in the code.p

When a row is tapped then the search view controller is dismissed and notifies the collection view controller using delegation the collection view is them refreshed with the results.p  pstrongSearching from detail view controllerstrong In the detail view controller, when the search is tapped. The detail view controller is popped off the stack revealing the collection view controller. I use delegation to notify the collection view controller that the detail view controller was popped of the stack after the tap of a search button. Immediately the search view controller is opened making it possible to search as if we originally presented the search view controller from the collection view controller.p  pMy issue arises when trying to search from my main view controller. Right now things are working but it doesnt have a very professional feel to it. Let me explain.p  pTo get search working from my main view controller I use delegation.

Ajax is used throughout the site, and transitioning between pages that have videos and dont work exactly as you would expect  Ajax grabs the new page content, slides it on, deletes the old content, and the video works perfectly. p  pHowever, on iOS Safari, the video does NOT load.   The space for the video is reserved  the other content on the page flows around the area where the video should be, which tells me the div is loading, and the height and width information of the iframe element is being registered by the browser.  But no video, nothing.  Reload the new page, though, and the video is there and plays just fine.p  pSo my question is Why is the reload required  What could I be doing wrong that is causing the AJAX to fail  I have read several answers across SO that seem to incriminate header information and crosssite drama, but it is danced around and not explained.  Can anyone give me a clear understanding of whats going on herep

Negative 4209 pIve been bitten by the testdriven infrastructure bug.  My current project is using Azure, including SQL Azure, Azure tables, cloud services, and mobile services.  Configuring an entire environment is somewhat complex.  Now Im looking for a testing framework that I can use to verify that the environment is configured correctly.  Something like Confirm that theres a mobile service endpoint named foo, that is has APNS and GCM endpoints, and that there is a Google API key and Apple push certificate associated.  There is more, but that is complex enough that existing tools dont seem to cover it but simple enough to describe in a single sentence.p  pBecause of the number of products, I have to use both the PowerShell module and the crossplatform CLI to script the setup.  The crossplatform CLI looks like the easiest way to get data out it uses Node and can easily dump JSON data, but Im at a loss as to how to even start with testing JSON dumps from a Node module that was never really intended to be used as a module.p  pThe PowerShell module is buggy and doesnt have any ability to read mobile services information.p  pThere is a ruby gem for managing Azure, but its very limited.  So my hope of being able to work all in Ruby was dashed.  There too, Im not sure how one would use ServerSpec to test a remote node without actually running anything on the remote node.p  pId like to stay within the realm of something that would be understandable by another Azure developer e.g. JavaScript, PowerShell, and potentially Ruby and not have to start from scratch with something like Erlang or Brainfk.p

Negative 4209 pI have a website thats been running for 7 years.  Recently we started seeing a problem where numbers were being added to the web page of a small number of users  the numbers would be hexadecimal numbers around 8000  usually something like 1fxx where xx is another hex number.  After some research, I found out that these appear on certain networks that use certain proxies and are related to Chunked Transfer encoding.  For instance, we see it all the time with iOS 8 on ATampT, but didnt see it when we were running iOS 7 on ATampT.  Some of the pages have code written many years ago and never had the problem until recently.  Other pages are new.  If the network is having a problem, it appears on all pages new and oldp  pWe found if we put a php headerHTTP1.0 200 OK at the top of the file, the problem is resolved for those networks with proxies that had the problem.  However, on another set of people, often running Samsung Galaxy S5 machines, they now get an error that the site is not available.  So if I force it to HTTP1.0, I make it stop working for some people.  If I dont, other people have an issue.  For most people, it works either way.p  pThe web stack is CentOS release 6.5, Apache2.0.64, MySQL 5.1.73, PHP 5.2.9.  p  pIs there something I can put in to detect whether I should put in the HTTP1.0 header or not  And what should I look for to try and make it start working with those proxies that cause the chunked transfer encoding to not be correctly interpreted.  Is there some way to increase the size of the chunked data so the entire page goes in one chunkp

Sitting in the kitchen of my girlfriends apartment, I was eating a bowl of cereal  Honey Nut Cheerios, I still remember  and browsing the web before making the 15minute drive to campus for class. I was looking for news about the big game, a top 10 SEC matchup between the Tennessee Volunteers and the Florida Gators. I was a junior at the University of Tennessee, and just 10 days earlier Id broken my wrist during the season opener. It required surgery, so I was going to be sidelined for the next six to eight weeks. Once on the Internet, I caught my first glimpse of the North Tower on fire, with smoke billowing from the top floors. I remember taking a moment to say a prayer for everyone affected. Then, right before my eyes, a plane flew into another building, the South Tower. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I was horrified. But I didnt know exactly what this meant for my country.I was a junior at the University of Tennessee, and just 10 days earlier Id broken my wrist during the season opener.

Mobile phones and electronic devices could still be banned from plane cabins, with the threat of a 911style coordinated attack on London and other major cities feared imminent. The warning comes as Whitehall officials admit that a terror strike on the UK is now almost inevitable particularly with British jihadis returning from fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. An airport security source told the Sunday Express Weve been told that five planes are being targeted in a high profile hit before Christmas. Theyve been waiting for the big one. We have many scares but this one nearly got hand baggage pulled from all airlines. The threat is still alive and real. The plot, which has been known about for the past two months, is thought to involve Islamists smuggling bombs on to planes bound for major European destinations before Christmas.The wellplaced security insider said talks had been held about how to deal with it, with suggestions made to ban hand luggage. The source said High level negotiations are continuing at Governmental level but at the moment there has been little done to respond. There is paralysis because of the difficulty of banning hand luggage which is one of the strongest weapons we have against the new threats.         All electronics may be banned from hand luggage and placed in the hold, that has been considered, and there has been behaviour analysis training at airports but while its effective, its difficult to roll out quickly and is not a sufficient safety net. The threat is aimed at Europe. The U.S has improved their security over the summer but we have not.Everyone is expecting something catastrophic very soon.ltpgt        ltdivgt      ltdivgt      lt Bottom Stories gt     lthrgt     lthr  styleheight0.3em color3090C7 gt    ltdiv classrowgt    ltdiv classcolmd3gt     lth13gtltigtStoryltigtlth13gt     ltpgtDonec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.

Negative 4209 pI have a supervisor who has a very annoying habit of editing our MySQL database in MS Excel. He does this by exporting the tables as a CSV, opening them in Excel, editing them, saving as a CSV, and reimporting. But there are some incompatibilities between PHPMyAdminMySQL and Excel, and so far this has led to two major system crashes once because he tried to import an entire database from a CSV, which obviously makes no sense since CSVs dont delineate tables and once because Excel added two extra rows to the CSV with incompatible data.p  pSince he refuses to listen when I tell him  to stop doing this, Id like to disable CSV import on his copy of PHPMyAdmin. We still need to be able to import SQL files, though. Is there any way to specifically disable imports of CSV files In the PHPMyAdmin settings, I see that you can set default values, but how can I just disable that format altogetherp

Negative 4209 pI need to detect when either of two file types are accessed in any way across an entire windows file system.p  pAs I understand it the only way to do this without causing serious slow downs for the operating system is to create a file system filter driverp  pEssentially all I need to do is take a copy of any docx files and pdfs that are opened. I decided on this approach as it was either that or use file monitors in C which wouldnt be effective for an entire drive.p  pMy question is two fold, is there an easier way and secondly how would I go about simply taking a copy of each docxpdf file as its accessedp  pThe solution needs to be deployable with the package were currently producing.p  pUPDATEp  pIm going to benchmark the file system watcher, after discussing it with people here I think its possible that it may be acceptable, my concern is the fact that I need to monitor the common user directories where downloads will occur so CUsersSomeUser as well as the outlook temporary folder.p

Negative 4209 pI developed a wifi hotspot that asks the users to login with their facebook credentials to get free internet. When you connect to the wifi network with an iphone or ipad, apple automaticly opens a pseudobrowser that redirects to my splash page hosted on my Apache server. The problem with this pseudobrowser is that it is not Safari, and does not handle cookies or PHP sessions. So users have to enter their login and password everytime they use the hotspot, while with Safari they skip this process if they have a facebook session already running on their phone. p  pFor instance, if they disable the autologin option on the network, they wont have the splash page poping up. And instead they will be redirected to the splash page as soon as they try to use Safari, and in this case they dont need to reenter their FB credentials.p  pI tried a commercialized version of this system at a specific venue, and I was surprised that, even though the pseudobrowser opened the splash page, the facebook credentials were not asked during the process and the facebook session was recognized. I am not sure if the session was retrieved from Safari, or the Facebook IOS App installed on the phone.p  pDoes anyone knows how this is possible to achieve Wether retrieving the App session or the Safari session, in the automated IOS splash page when connecting to a hotspotp  pI am developing my splash page in PHP, and use the facebook API.p

Negative 4209 pI am trying to resolve an issue with a mobile menu.  This is not a website that I created, so I am a little unfamiliar with the developers code.  I thought the problem should be an easy enough fix, but I cant quite nail it.  Basically, when you click on the Main Menu button, a dropdown menu appears.  It stays up until you click on main menu a second time.  I would ideally like to have the menu close whenever one of the other pages in the menu is clicked.  In other words, clicking menu opens the dropdown menu, and then clicking home or about would make the menu disappear.p  pI am unfortunately not able to supply a web link or the actual files.

Negative 4209 pI have worked through the Learning Website Development with DJango book, which takes you through the creation of a basic bookmarksharing site, and this all works as described in the book as long as I run it on the Django development server.  I am now trying to set it up using apache on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04 on which I have installed the bitnami django stack a hrefhttpsbitnami.comstackdjango relnofollowhttpsbitnami.comstackdjangoa. p  pI had to modify httpdapp.conf, and settings.py to take account of the fact that the project files are not in the toplevel folder for the project which the development server appears to take account of automatically, and I can access individual pages of the site.  p  pThe site includes a simple user login system through django.contrib.auth which means that a user has to login before being able to access some pages, and this works fine on the development server, but it does not appear to be working with apache and I am just returned back to the same page after hitting the submit button on the login page.  I did find one reference to this via a Google search, but there was no solution provided.p  pThe django documentation does include information on authorization a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7howtodeploymentwsgiapacheauth relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7howtodeploymentwsgiapacheautha but a this appears to refer to blocking access to site folders rather than authorization for individual views which is what the application from the book does, and b I have made the changes that are described there, and it appears to make no difference.p  pI have also gone through many web pages unearthed via google that refer to user authorization, but most of these refer to earlier versions of django and reference functions or settings that do not appear to be in django 1.7 which I am using or dont directly address my problem.  After having spent quite a few hours on this, as a django newbie I am pretty thoroughly confused.  I think it must be a trivial problem, and am pretty sure that there is a combination of settings that will solve it, but I just cant seem to figure it out, and any help or links to tutorials  guides on how to do so would be much appreciated.  Most of the training materials I can find for django all use the builtin development server not unreasonably and even when they refer to deployment on a production server basically just say its outside their scope and dont provide anything of use.p  pI am posting the what I think are the relevant files belowp  phttpdapp.conf from the django project conf folderp  precodeltIfDefine ISDJANGOSTACKLOADEDgt  Define ISDJANGOSTACKLOADED WSGIDaemonProcess wsgidjangostack processes2 threads15 displaynameGROUP ltIfDefinegt   ltDirectory homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02djangowebtest02gt     Options MultiViews     AllowOverride All     ltIfVersion lt 2.3 gt         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     ltIfVersiongt     ltIfVersion gt 2.3gt         Require all granted     ltIfVersiongt      WSGIProcessGroup wsgidjangostack  WSGIApplicationGroup GLOBAL     ltIfVersion lt 2.3 gt         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     ltIfVersiongt     ltIfVersion gt 2.3gt         Require all granted     ltIfVersiongt  ltDirectorygt  Alias static homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangolibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangocontribadminstatic WSGIScriptAlias djangowebtest02 homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02djangowebtest02wsgi.py codepre  phttpdvhosts.confp  precodeltVirtualHost 8080gt     ServerName djangostack.example.com     ServerAlias www.djangostack.example.com     DocumentRoot homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02djangowebtest02      Include homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02confhttpdapp.conf ltVirtualHostgt  ltVirtualHost 8443gt     ServerName djangostack.example.com     ServerAlias www.djangostack.example.com     DocumentRoot homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02djangowebtest02     SSLEngine on     SSLCertificateFile homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02confcertsserver.crt     SSLCertificateKeyFile homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02confcertsserver.key      Include homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangodjangoprojectsdjangowebtest02confhttpdapp.conf ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pFrom the apache httpd.conf file the file is very long to post in its entirety, and so I am showing here just the final section where I have added content based on the various web sites I have looked atp  precodeInclude confdeflate.conf Include confpagespeed.conf Include confpagespeedlibraries.conf  WSGIScriptAlias  homegeorge.virtualenvsdjangowebtest02wsgi.py  LoadModule wsgimodule modulesmodwsgi.so WSGIPythonHome homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40python   virtualenv WSGIPythonPath homegeorge.virtualenvsdjangowebtest02libpython2.7sitepackages  WSGIPassAuthorization On   The following lines prevent .user.ini PHP settings files from being viewed by Web clients. ltFiles .user.inigt  ltIfVersion lt 2.3 gt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all ltIfVersiongt ltIfVersion gt 2.3gt     Require all denied ltIfVersiongt  ltFilesgt   Security  ServerSignature Off ServerTokens Prod TraceEnable Off  Include homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40apache2confssi.conf Include homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40apache2confbitnamibitnami.conf  Include homegeorgedjangostack1.7.40appsdjangoconfdjango.conf codepre  pA final point is that I am using virtualenv but have followed the instructions here a hrefhttpscommunity.bitnami.comthowtogetvirtualenvworkingondjangostack765 relnofollowhttpscommunity.bitnami.comthowtogetvirtualenvworkingondjangostack765a and as far as I can tell, there are not any problems with this.p  pAny help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4209 pIm working on some software that is essentially a pubsub framework.p  pOn subscription, I have to keep a record of what is being subscribed to, and I need to make both subscription and unsubscription atomic operations. A connection is identified by a guid, and can have multiple subscriptions Alice wants NEWS and WEATHER, for example. So once Alice establishes a connection with an ID, she can codeSubscribecode multiple times to events she cares about. p  pIn simple terms, my subscribe looks like thisp  precodeConcurrentDictionaryltstring, Listltstringgtgt subscriptionsForConnection async Task Subscribe     Listltstringgt subscriptikons  subscriptionsForConnection.GetOrAddconnectionId, MakeNewList    await underlyingComponentA.SubscribeAsyncxxx    subscriptions.Addxxx    await underlyingComponentB.SubscribeAsyncxxx  codepre  pThe problem is, I need to synchronize the dictionary to make sure the Subscribe and Unsubscribe operations dont overlap in a way where the subscriptions list ends up not accurately representing the state of subscriptions.p  pConceptually, I would like something along the lines ofp  precodelocksubscriptionsForconnection      subscriptions  GetOrAdd     await SubscribeA     subscriptions.Add     await SubscribeB  codepre  pHowever .net 4.5 does not allow you to have codeawaitcode inside of a codelockcode for a number of reasons, including that your execution might resume in another context, making it impossible to unlock. Which means Monitor.EnterExit will not work.p  pAnother approach would be to serialize the two underlying component calls and make them run synchronously using the codeWaitcode method, but this seems wrong. p  pIt occurs to me that Im probably thinking about this problem wrong, so I welcome your suggestions.p  pstrongAdditional Detailsstrong Ive abstracted a few details out of my explanation to make it clearer. For those who are wondering.  Im developing a component on top of SignalR. codeunderlyingComponentB.SubscribeAsynccode is actually the Groups.Add call.  codeunderlyingComponentA.SubscribeAsynccode is an external message bus that will drive my componentp

Negative 4209 pHello Stackoverflow users. this is my first question. p  pIm using ruby and gtk3 to make a few GUIs for scripts that I use a lot. The problem Im having is that when I run the script it opens the console window as well as the GUI, which in my mind defeats the purpose of a GUI.p  pIm currently trying to run the scripts by executing them on my desktop. I tried packaging it inside OCRA but that generated a lot of errors. I dont mind packaging or running the script directly as long as it doesnt open a console window, or at the very least closes it when it launches.  Im using windows, and ruby 2.0.x.p  pBasically I dont want a DOS console window to open when I run my script.p  pIm intermediate with ruby so please, clear instructions and simple solutions.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4209 pA general question about supporting and treatment of multiple different integer sizes and whether they should be treated as independent types like string vs int or one a subset of the other. Specifically Im considering uint8t and uint32t. p  pI want to construct a message object which I shall use to send a message across a network. In the simplest case it will have a header containing the size of the payload, and a payload. I have 3 types of data to send. p  ol liString data where the header is the length of the string, and the payload is the string.li li1 byte integer data, where the header is 1 and the payload is a uint8t.li li4 byte integer data, where the header is 4 and the payload is a uint32t.li ol  pActually I also use one bit of the header to flag whether its an int or a string type, but thats not really important here.p  pIn creating my message object, obviously I treat string as distinct from integer and it has its own constructor to create the raw message. Im trying to determine what is the best practice for dealing with the different types of integers. p  pI couldp  ol liTreat them separately. Having two constructors, one accepting a uint8t and one accepting a uint32t.li liTreat the uint8t as a subset of the uint32t and having a one constructor accepting a uint32t and then testing whether its most significant three bytes are zero.li ol  pUltimately I would like to have support for 1, 2, 4 and 8 byte integers and dont like the idea of the proliferation in constructors Id get if I took option 1, when I can have one general constructor and test the value of what Im passed to determine what type it should be. However I want to do the correct thing. So my question is ... should uint8t and uint32t be treated as separate types, in the same way string and uint8t would be. Or is it good practice to consider a uint8t as a subset of a uin32tp

Negative 4209 pWe are implementing the load balancer with 3 Servers. Suppose a situation like this. User logs into the system from Server1 and the Server1 responses with the authentication cookie. if any consecutive request from that authenticated user is made on Server1 everything fine, but if the request is made on Server2 or Server3 than the problem occures. Basically the cookie is presend in codeHTTP headerscode but when retrieving it in codeGlobal.asaxcodes codeApplicationAuthenticateRequestcode with the following codep  precodevar authCookie  Request.Cookies[FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName] codepre  pit comes out to be codenullcode. I think that there should be a problem with the ticket itself which is present in authentication cookie. The ticket is not valid for some reason. As I searcher the web I found out that the MachineKey is used to Encrypt and Decrypt am I right  this is my guess the ticket, and the different machines are having the different MachineKey. Can I share the MachineKey between the servers  Would I be exposed to any kind of vulnurability that way  What is the best workaround in this situation. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 4209 pIve got a JTable inside a JScrollPane inside a JPanel. I would like to make the rows of the JTable fill the entire height of the JPanel. Like, if i have 10 rows, they strech out in height direction and fill the entire JPanel, and and if i add 10 more rows, the rows should resize so i could fit all 20 rows in the JPanel.p  pIve managed to make the JScrollPane fill the entire height of the panel, but the table cells stay at a fixed size. Is there a way to do this I suppose it might be possible to fire an event upon resizing the window and then set the row height using the window height and number of rows, but it sounds like a lot of work so if there is an easier way to do this i would be very happy p

Negative 4209 pI am working on a game and I am thinking about getting into networking. I have been programming for about 5 years and got into game development the last 2 years.

I realized when there is a screen rotation, both View.OnLayoutChangeListener and ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener are notified.p  pTo determine which one I shall use for detecting screen rotation, I need to understand the circumstanced under which either of them are notified.p  pFor View.OnLayoutChangeListener, its clear from the documentation that it is notified when the views bound changes.p  pHowever, the documentation for ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener is unclear to me.

Negative 4209 pIm using codeboostasiowritecode to write data from a buffer to a comPort. Its a serial port with a baud rate 115200 which means as far as my understanding goes that I can write effectively 11520 bytes or 11,52KBs data to the socket.p  pNow Im having a quite big chunk of data 10015 bytes which i want to write. I think that this should take little less than a second to really write on the port. But codeboostasiowritecode returns already 300 microseconds after the call with the transferred bytes 10015. I think this is impossible with that baud ratep  pSo my question is what is it actually doing Really writing it to the port, or just some other kind of buffer maybe, which later writes it to the port.p  pId like the codewritecode to only return after all the bytes have strongreallystrong been written to the port.p  pEDIT with code examplep  pThe problem is that i always run into the timeout for the futurepromise because it takes alone more than 100ms to send the message, but I think the timer should only start after the last byte is sent.

Negative 4209 pI would like to create a simple and robust communication protocol between two devices master and slave. The master could be a pc or an arm iMX6 bard or equivalent board with QT or Visual Studio application, while the slave could be a microprocessor like AVR or Microchip. I would like to find the best solution to design a simple and robust serial protocol between them. I have thought about two possible solutions, but maybe there are other solutions.p  pFirst solution  synchronous communicationp  pMASTER sends COMMANDSTART one bytep  pSLAVE answers with STARTACKNOLEDGE one bytep  pMASTER sends the command COMMAND more bytes with at the end a checksum bytep  pSLAVE answers with COMMANDACKNOLEDGE one byte and if it is necessary with  some bytes of information PACKETS some bytes with at the end a checksum bytep  pMASTER answers with PACKETSACKNOLEDGE one byte p  pMASTER sends the COMMANDEND one bytep  pThe slave has to answer to the master within for example 1 ms or 2 ms. With this solution it is easy for the master to check the communication, if the slave does not answer or if the slave does not answer within 1 or 2 ms or if the checksum of the packets sent by the slave is uncorrect, the master could send another time the command. In this way it is easy for the master to handle this situation.From the other side this protocol is a synchronous communication protocol.p  pSecond solutionp  pMaster sends commands to the slave with the following structurep  pStart byte 0xAA 10101010p  pCommand byte one byte different than 0xAA, 0xCC,0x33, 0xC3 or 0x3Cp  pData length one byte with the information on the number of data bytes is it necessaryp  pData bytes one or more bytesp  pChecksum one bytep  pEnd bytes 0xCC 0x33 0xC3 0x3C  11001100001100111100001100111100p  pIn this situation the slave could use a circular buffer with two pointers and it could do something like thisp  precodeifRxStartRxStop   whileRxStopgtRxStartampampRxStopRxStartgtX4     ifRxBuff[RxStart amp 0xFF]0xAA ampamp RxBuff[RxStartX amp 0xFF]0xCC ampamp       RxBuff[RxStartX1 amp 0xFF]0x33  ampamp  RxBuff[RxStartX2 amp 0xFF]0xC3    ampamp RxBuff[RxStartX3 amp 0xFF]0x3C       ifCheckSumOK          switchRxBuff[RxStart1 amp 0xFF]                       codepre  pIn this situation how the master could check if the command sent to the slave has been received Does the slave have to send an acknoledge to the master for the command for example one byte for acknoledge and one byte with the information about the command Does the master have to check if the slave answers to the command within 1ms Does the master have to check the number of the acknoledge received from the slave If the acknoledge received from the slave are less then the command sent by the master, how the master could understand which command has been lost Let me knowp  pThank you very much for the supportp

So at any point of time if we delete Line it should go and delete Pt1 and Pt2.pli lipTime T2 We create two new points Pt3 and Pt4 these are now independent objectspli lipTime T3 We create a Curve object which is referencing Pt2, Pt3 and Pt4. Here the Pt2s lifecycle is controled by Line object.pli lipTime T4 We delete the Line object from graphics, now as a requirement this operation must go and delete Pt1 and Pt2 as they were create by Line and Line object has been deleted.pli lipTime T5 Since curve was also referencing Pt2 hence now its geometric computation is incomplete and will be made to reference to a stub object. The Curve object will be marked as broken so that in future point of time we can edit it to refer to new point.pli ol  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVDXBH.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe key issues in having this system is that because deleting is controlled by .NET system, we do not have control over it.

Negative 4209 pI originally had my app setup to store one line items in a single entity within my core data model. I have since decided to change this to allow the main uitableview to simply list the name of each item and then when you tap on an item you can edit the item name and add additional sub items within a uitextview.p  pI have two VCs.p  ul liViewControllerli liEditItemli ul  pI now have two entities.  p  pItem   itemNamebr List   listNamep  pcodeItemcode has a relationship to codeListcodebr  list  List  itemsp  pcodeListcode has a relationship to codeItemcodebr  items  Item  list  p  pWhat I am a little confused around is how to go about fetching the data that is being stored in the new entity. If codeListcode is a child of codeItemcode, will fetching codeItemcode automagically fetch objects from codeListcode p  pRight now you are able to input an item on the main VC and save it. If you then tap on that item you are taken to a secondary VC that allows you to edit that item. p  pWhen I am fetching codeItemcode in my main VC, should I also be fetching objects from codeListcode as well and then pass them within my codeprepareforseguecode method  p  pThe idea here is that  p  ul liIf the item name exists and it is left alone or edited, it should be written back to the modelli liIf there is no todolist, the user should add items to the list, and tapping codeSavecode should update the codeitemcode and the codetodo listcode at that time.li ul  pstrongcurrent NSFetchedResultsController on ViewControllerstrongp  precodeNSFetchedResultsController  fetchedResultsController  if fetchedResultsController  nil      return fetchedResultsController   NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc]init] NSManagedObjectContext context  [self managedObjectContext] NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameItem inManagedObjectContextcontext] [fetchRequest setEntityentity]  NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptor  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyitemname ascendingYES] NSArray sortDescriptors  [[NSArray alloc]initWithObjectssortDescriptor, nil] fetchRequest.sortDescriptors  sortDescriptors fetchedResultsController  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc]initWithFetchRequestfetchRequest managedObjectContextcontext sectionNameKeyPathnil cacheNamenil] fetchedResultsController.delegate  self return fetchedResultsController  codepre  pstrongcurrent save IBAction on EditItemstrongp  precode IBActionsaveidsender  NSManagedObjectContext context  [self managedObjectContext]  if self.editItemField       Update existing device     self.toDoItem.itemname  self.editItemField.text   NSError error  nil  Save the object to persistent store if [context saveamperror]      NSLogCant Save  , error, [error localizedDescription]   [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVjfUB.png altEdit Item VC img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIRtxz.png altData Modelp  pAs you can see from the screenshot, the idea is that the top textfield is populated with the list title from the previous VC. This works like it should. The user can then edit the title or leave it as is. They can then add items to that list using the second textfield.p  pWhen I submit a list item on the codeEdit Itemcode VC, the new object is saved to my model but is not displayed in the UITableView. From the way I think this should work, I think my Edit Item VC should be setup pretty much like my ViewController VC is setup. I shouldnt have to fetch anything as that is handled initially when I setup my context, etc. Being that there is a relationship between my codeItemcode entity and my codeListcode entity, all of that information gets fetched together. Am I correct in that assumptionp  pWhen I save an item back to the model on the codeEdit Itemcode VC, is there an association automatically made between the list item and its parent item namep  pAny push in the right direction on this is appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI added p  precodeNSError error  nil if [[self fetchedResultsController] performFetchamperror]      NSLogError , error     abort  codepre  pInto my viewDidLoad method.

Coming from a Java background, this is weird. Why expose parameter names to the end of the user pli lipIt is prone to ambiguity which can lead to bugs. The programmer needs to do extra thinking and problems can creep up when the programmer wind up writing methods that use the same method nameaka overloading methods. You will always get a call is ambiguous when you have two methods with same name with the same parameters for each other even if the other method has a extra parameters with different data types. The only fix I can think of is to make the data type a mandatory parameter aka a parameter without a default value so the compiler does not get confused.

Negative 4209 pThere is a common pattern for web application caching in MVC frameworks, in shortp  pIn controllermodel code developer can call a special method and pass cache key and closure. If key already in cache, data returned from cache, if key missed, closure is called and data generatedp  precodemydata  cachemykey do   someheavycalculation end codepre  pSame used in Viewsp  precodelt cachemykey do gt  heavy HTML with calculations lt end gt codepre  pNow we need Cache Warm Up. Problem that the closure can be called only inside real working code. I.e. Obviously we cannot fetch all keys from cache and then somehow recalculate refresh all data by calling again closure code for any of found keys.p  pSo the only way to warmup cache is to crawl website for example using recursive wget or sitemaps file.p  pQuestion isp  pAFAIK this pattern is very popular and seems the default way to do things. However the warmup method is very limited. It cannot refresh caches for loggedin users its too hard to crawl whole site for emeachem user. It cannot access code, unaccessible from controllersviews i.e. generated from cronjobsp  pSo, why its so popularp  pIs that true that for typical web application most of cache data accessible from loggedout pagesp  pIs there some obvious law that its impossible to cache data of loggedin users effectivelyp  pIs there a reason why dirty hacks like wgetsitemaps used to populate cache instead ofoutbox solutions in frameworksp  pMaybe people just ignore problem, because its insignificant Or too complexp  pI am asking the quesion because I am investigating possible way to rework our application cache and I cannot explain to myself why above approach is used and how it sufficient our needs  it seems we have large traffic for loggedin users.p  pOf course there are ways to collect statistics, but I also looking for alternative explanationproof that it willwill not work.p  pNote that I dont ask emhowem to solve problem of caching for loggedin users with some different approach. Only investigating suitability of above approach.p

Negative 4209 pI have a web application that talks to a webserver via REST, this web application could be running on a public computer and enables multiple users to logon and logout in a given time period.p  pAll cookies are HTTPonly, this is simply an additional security measure to cover cases of successful XSS attacks. This means that a REST call must be made to force a logout.p  pMy concern is that when the webserver goes down for any reason or becomes inaccessible eg a network cable being disconnected somewhere. When the user hits logout, there is actually no way of removing the cookie. Meaning that the user may walk away from the PC, meanwhile another user could come along when the connection is restored or server comes back, and just continue using the previous users account.p  pWhat is the typical way of dealing with this use case admittedly not particularly common.p

Negative 4209 pI have the scenario where I have two worlds of C codes separated by a calling barrier that is only C for design reasons. in more detail I have a main thread and multiple child threads where each of the childs can service me calling a bunch of functions with a passed set of arguments and returning the functions result. the interconnect is pure C but the architecture is shared memory and the data to pass are for some of the calls C vector objects.p  pDoing it the simple way on a vector failed for me  this statement only gets the pointer on the data of the object but not the object pointer itselfp  precodevectorltsomethinggt myobject void  argv0  ampmyobject codepre  pIf I learnt the right way the class is designed for providing me a pointer onto its data array rather than a pointer on the object which further has special members for management like size or allocated space. as the target layer is not capable to manage and update the special members it will happen that any need for alterations to that area can not be done. In other words the operator has a classdefined pairing of void   vector and I dont see how to overcome that in a direct C fashion.p  pMy next best guess was this C fashion approachp  precodetypedef union      void               pvObject     vectorltsomethinggt  pcObject  VECTORVOIDUNIONT  vectorltsomethinggt myobject VECTORVOIDUNIONT uVV uVV.pcObject  ampmyobject void  argv0  uVV.pvObject codepre  pI am really not sure if this is the best or only way to do it in a case with such sort of class design. There might be other operators like the C extended casting operators that might solve the access problem to the object pointer itself much more gently. but as of now any attempt I tried out did not give me success.p  pMy question is now How to correctly and more elegantly overcome that classdefined operator or one of its equivalents in a C fashion so that finally the pointer to the vector object [edit not the vector data] is stored in the variable of type voidp

The Combobox column where I used the EditorSupport for the column and return a ComboboxCellEditor in the getCellEditor method but you can only see that there is a combobox in the column when you select a cell in that column. Then when you click out of the cell the selected value goes back to the default blank. The same goes for the checkbox columns where it is is only visible when the cell is selected.  Im looking for something that will display my tree with the combobox column and checkbox columns always visible.  Ive looked at TableViewer but couldnt find a way to force in a tree in the first column.  Ive looked at Nebula Grid but that doesnt look like it supports comboboxes. Any tips on how to get one of these to work like what I am looking for or if there is some other treetablegrid I should be looking at.
