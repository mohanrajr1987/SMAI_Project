Positive 1702 pI am writing a client server program and it is my idea to have the server as simple as possible.  The server will need to complete tasks such as move this file, delete a file , run this complex algorithm on the columns in a file and send back results.p  pI have created an abstract class that will be sent between server and client called aTodo There is one method called DoClass in this abstract class that is to be run by the server.p  pCurrently my server listens and waits for a connection.  When it receives a connection it creates an object of type aTodo via unserialization.  Then the server runs the DoClass function in that object.  The server then serializes the object and sends it back to the client. here is the code for referencep  precodeprotocolBaseServer pBasenewSockFd create socket stduniqueptrltaTodogt DoThis create object variable DoThisprotocolComReadltaTodogtpBase read the stream into the variable  DoThisgtDoClasscall the do function in the  protocolComWriteDoThis,pBasewrite back to the client codepre  pIs this a good way to program a server It is VERY simple on the server. p  pAnother way I was thinking was to create a delegate class that would be serialized and sent back and forth. The delegate would have a DoDelegate method. Then the user could put ANY function into the delegates DoDelegate method.  This would in affect allow the server to run any method in a class rather than just the Single DoClass method I have the server run now.p  pThanksp

Positive 1702 pIm attempting to write an a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2812section3.1.2 relnofollowRFC 2812a compliant C IRC library. I am having some trouble with the design of the client itself. From what I have read IRC communication tends to be asynchronous.p  pI am using codeboostasioasyncreadcode and codeboostasioasyncwritecode. From reading the documentation I have gathered that you cannot perform multiple asyncwrite requests before one is completed. You therefore end up with rather nested callbacks. Doesnt this defeat the purpose of doing async calls Wouldnt it just be better to use synchronous calls to prevent the nesting If not, whyp  pSecondly, if I am not mistaken, each codeboostasioasyncwritecode should be followed up by a codeboostasioasyncreadcode to receive the servers response to the commands sent. My clients functions, therefore, would need to take a callback parameter so a user of the class may do something after the client receives a response ex. send another message....p  pIf I were to continue implementing this with async, should I keep a codestddequeltstdtupleltmessage, callbackgtgtcode and each time a codeboostasioasyncwritecode is finished, and there is a tuple in the queue, dequeue and send the message then raise the callback Would this be the optimal way to implement this systemp  pIm thinking since messages are sent all the time Im going to have to implement some kind of listener loop that queues up responses, but how would you associate these responses with the specific command that triggered them Or in the case that the response is just a message to the channel from another userp

Positive 1702 pWith unknown reason, boost binary serialization doesnt work occasionally. The parsed data is corrupted sometimes.p  pOriginally I serialized instances of selfdefined class manually, with each instance being a line in a text file. However, the speed was slow.The text file was dealt in a speed of 2 MBsec, which can be seen in windows task manager. Recently I changed to use the boost binary serialization. However, strange things happens.p  pI stored many many instances of class InstanceIdentity, which contains a string member variable and a struc member variable representing the xyz integer coordinates.p  pMy Problem The previous 504 instances can be parsed from the binary file successfully and printed to screen. However the 505th instance is falsely parsed.The xyz coordinates should be no more than 512. And then the following instances become a mess. And soon an unknown exception is thrown from boost.

But at least this is MUCH easier on the eyes. Another point is that it eliminates boilerplate and is less error prone since the mapping doesnt need to be kept in sync with additions or removals to and from the enumeration itself.p  pIs there a way I can accomplish this with Boost.Preprocessor, template trickery, or some other useful mechanicp  pI did find some ideas online but most of it was handspun macros, which I want to avoid. I feel like if I have to go the macro approach that Boost.Preprocessor will be able to do this for me, but its very complex to use and Im not sure how to use it to solve this problem. Also most of the solutions I found were really dated, and I want to see if answers would be different with features introduced in STL and core language since between C03 and C14.p

Positive 1702 pI am having a wicked problem with exposing a polymorphic class hierarchy via a factory. I have created an example that demonstrates the problem. p  pThis is all being hosted in a executable with an embedded pythonstackless 2.7 interpreter. When I run the executable and get the Python code I can create a variable from the factory a  MakeB this returns a smart pointer to the TestA class but holds an instance of TestB. The problem I have is that when I access the base class member variablesfunctions it works, but accessing TestB variablesfunctions generates a segment fault 11 osx. p  pThe returned instance reports to python that its class is TestB strongclassstrong reports the same and the print messages show that TestB was constructed and returned. Of note that it I create TestB directly opposed to the factory the base classs variablesfunctions work correctly. p  pMy actual production code is more complex, but this has boiled it down to this test example. I can provide a backtrace of the segfault if anyone thinks it will help. p  pThanks. p  precodegtprint sys.version 2.7.6a1 Stackless 3.1b3 060516 default, Jan 10 2014, 131351  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 clang500.2.79] codepre  phpp Filep  precodeclass TestA typedef boostsharedptrltTestAgt TestAPtr class TestB typedef boostsharedptrltTestBgt TestBPtr class TestA  public      TestA     virtual TestA     static void Boostvoid     string Aprop     void FuncA    class TestB  public TestA  public      TestB     virtual TestB     static void Boostvoid     string Bprop     void FuncB  codepre  pcpp Filep  precodeTestATestA  ApropTest A      printfCreate TestAn  TestATestA      printfDestroy TestAn  void TestABoostvoid      classlt TestA gtTestA, initltgt         .defFuncA, ampTestAFuncA         .defreadwriteAprop, ampTestAAprop              registerptrtopythonlt boostsharedptrltTestAgt gt  void TestAFuncA      printfHi From Test An      Test B  TestBTestB  TestA, BpropTest B      printfCreate TestBn   TestBTestB      printfDestroy TestBn  void TestBBoostvoid      classlt TestB, basesltTestAgt gtTestB, initltgt     .defFuncB, ampTestBFuncB     .defreadwriteBprop, ampTestBBprop              registerptrtopythonlt boostsharedptrltTestBgt gt  void TestBFuncB      printfHi From Test Bn    Factory...

Positive 1702 pI want to create a custom map that that actually uses a fixed set of keys, but should behave like a codestdmapcode. Basically I use an array internally and map the keys to indexes, allowing very efficient lookup.

Positive 1702 pI am trying to eliminate the warnings in my project so I can turn on the flag that treats warnings as errors. The project uses the boost library, specifically the Conceptcheck.hpp and cuthillmckeeordering.hpp files. The warnings 4510 and 4610 are shown in the conceptcheck.hpp file and I have tried to disable them using pragma warning push and pop. The warnings are caused by the boost library trying to instantiate a class using the template found in conceptcheck.cpp when there is no constructor written for it. p  pMy Question is this Is there a more sure fire way that I can disable these warnings without modifying the boost code I am using Visual studio 2010. p

However, on the next postback, the values that were in the ViewState before I hit refresh magically reappear.  p  pThis behavior screws up my webcontrol.  After I hit refresh, the control is returned to its initial state, since the ViewState is empty and IsPostBack is set to false.  However, when I click on one of the postback controls within my WebControl, the WebControl will reload with the same values that were in ViewState before I hit refresh.  p  pStrangely, this only happens when Im using AJAX.  When my control is outside of an UpdatePanel, Firefox gives me its standard message, To display this page, Firefox must send information that will repeat any action such as a search or order confirmation that was performed earlier Resend Cancel.  This is fine, because at least the behavior is consistent.  However, I absolutely must use AJAX for this project.p  pSo this is what I would like to do  I want to make the refresh behavior consistent.  It would be best if hitting refresh didnt affect the ViewState at all.  But if it has to wipe out the ViewState, thats fine, as long as the ViewState STAYS wiped out.

Negative 1702 pIm working on an application that runs on Windows Mobile 6 that needs to be able to retrieve all items from an item table that contain a given string provided by the end user within the items description field. The problem is that there are approximately 170,000 items in the table. Since I need to return all items that contain the string anywhere within the description Im forced to use a LIKE string, which eliminates any chance to use the index. The data and table structure are originally based on a Progress database, which has a wonderful contains operator on any wordindexed fields. This is not the case on our mobile application, since it uses SQL Server Compact 3.5.p  pBasically, my DAL runs the query and retrieves an SqlCeDataReader and then uses an ItemFactory to create a List object that contains only the matched items. This obviously lets us keep our domainbusiness objects separate from the data access layer.p  pFine and dandy, except for the 8m and 42s that it takes to retrieve items when I search for all items that contain something like golf in the description. Obviously this is not an acceptable time frame for the end user.p  pMy first attempt was to instead retrieve all items back from the database using SELECT  FROM Item with an order by clause on one of the main indexed fields. At this point I ran an IndexOf check as I ran through the SqlCeDataReader and had the ItemFactory only add items to the List object if they contained the requested description text. This improved the speed down to 1m 46s. Not too shabby, but still too slow.p  pI then tried another approach that showed promise... almost... While the application starts up, I tried creating a List that contained all item objects within the database takes about 2 minutes to run the query and populate the entire list, but at least its only once as the app is initializing... still... ugh. Once the list is complete, I can easily run queries on that list doing things such as the following I hope my syntax is right... Im not at work right now and I dont have Visual Studio on the pc Im sitting atp  precodeListltItemgt specificItems       AllItems.FindAlli gt i.Description.IndexOfsearchString, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase gt 0 codepre  pThis approach knocked it down to 21s. Very nice still slow though in the grand scheme of things. However, the problem is that the memory usage is way too great if I load all the items from the database. I had to actually cut off the last 20,000 items so the 21s time frame probably would have been more like 25s during the initial load, because an OutOfMemoryException was being thrown. According to the memory manager on the emulator, I still had about 20 MB of free RAM, but Ive heard that a process can only have 32 MB or RAM associated to it not sure if thats true for WM 6, but it appears so.p  pTo make sure it wasnt because I was using a List object to hold all the items which I was instantiating with the needed capacity in its constructor to avoid dynamic resizing, which Ive also read may cause extra memory usage when it implicity calls EnsureCapacity, I tried using an Item[] array sized ahead of time. This still had the memory issue and the size difference was negligible.p  pOk enough rambling. I know Im likely going to have to some how limit the records returned from the database by the datareader through some indexed search on a different type of field and then will likely use indexOf on that smaller subset of items to get maximum performance thus skipping the Like operator all together. This will cause the end user to have to enter more than just a description search though perhaps item hierarchy information to limit which type of items to search within.p  pAny ideas Am I going about this the wrong wayp  pThanks for listening sorry this post is long, Im kind of thinking out loud.p  pOh I should add just in summary what Im usingp  ul liWindows Mobile 6  li liSql Server Compact Edition 3.5li liC 3.5li ul  pUPDATE While the Bloom Filter approach mentioned below seemed interesting, I could not fulfill one requirement which I didnt really specify above. I cant really match words that are contained inside other words e.g. club would not return clubs. Due to this, I was forced to use a different approach altogether Kent Fredric... thanks for pointing this out. Ive marked Kents answer as the correct one, since his approach was the one that filled the most requirements Mitch, yours had a similar issue as the Bloom filter suggested by Jaunder. However, I have gone a different approach for now... than his way as well.p  pWhat Ive done is pulled all item objects into memory, with only item numbers and descriptions which keeps it under the memory limitations, however it still does cause a longer initialization than I like... multithreading and loading that information behind the scenes while the application is running can take care of that I guess. To perform the searches Ive written my own contains routine. The routine is written in unmanaged c code that uses two pointers and a couple of loops to run through the description and the required matching text. If it finds a match anywhere in the description, it adds the item number to an array. Once all items have been searched, a new query goes back to the database and grabs only the matching item numbers which is very fast due to the index on an integer field. Then those items are created in a List with all information not just the item number and description. The whole operation takes approximately 5  10 seconds depending on the description, which is good enough for now.p  pIll still look into further optimizing this might be able to track how many characters the search term is... if there are less characters remaining on the item description than the required text, the loop could continue straight to the next item.p  pAny suggestions are still welcome. For now I have marked Kents answer as the most correct for my question.p  pProps to Dolch for helping me write the contains routine.p

Negative 1702 pLooking at the combination of MapReduce and HBase from a dataflow perspective, my problem seems to fit. I have a large set of documents which I want to Map, Combine and Reduce. My previous SQL implementation was to split the task into batch operations, cumulatively storing what would be the result of the Map into table and then performing the equivalent of a reduce. This had the benefit that at any point during execution or between executions, I had the results of the Map at that point in time.p  pAs I understand it, running this job as a MapReduce would require all of the Map functions to run each time.p  pMy Map functions and indeed any function always gives the same output for a given input. There is simply no point in recalculating output if I dont have to. My input a set of documents will be continually growing and I will run my MapReduce operation periodically over the data. Between executions I should only really have to calculate the Map functions for newly added documents.p  pMy data will probably be HBase  MapReduce  HBase. Given that Hadoop is a whole ecosystem, it may be able to know that a given function has been applied to a row with a given identity. Im assuming immutable entries in the HBase table. Does  can Hadoop take account of thisp  pIm made aware from the documentation especially the Cloudera videos that recalculation of potentially redundant data can be quicker than persisting and retrieving for the class of problem that Hadoop is being used for.p  pAny comments  answersp

Negative 1702 pSo I know the convention for naming MM relationship tables in SQL is to have something like sop  pFor tables User and Data the relationship table would be calledp  blockquote   pUserDatabr   UserDatap blockquote  por something similar from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions631850howdoyounameyourmanytomanyrelationshiptablesherea  p  pWhat happens then if you need to have multiple relationships between User and Data, representing each in its own table  I have a site Im working on where I have two primary items and multiple independent MM relationships between them.  I know I could just use a single relationship table and have a field which determines the relationship type, but Im not sure whether this is a good solution.  Assuming I dont go that route, what naming convention should I follow to work around my original problemp  pTo make it more clear, say my site is an auction site it isnt but the principle is similar.  I have registered users and I have items, a user does not have to be registered to post an item but they do need to be to do anything else. I have table User which has info on registered users and Items which has info on posted items.  Now a user can bid on an item, but they can also report a item spam, etc., both of these are MM relationships.  All that happens when either event occurs is that an email is generated, in my scenario I have no reason to keep track of the actual report or bid other than to know who bidreported on what.p

Negative 1702 pI am building a job site  yes, there isnt enough of those yet. One of the problems I came across in my research is how to match the relevant resumes to the interested recruiters. The most boring solution I thought of is to use textual analysis to parse the resumes for tags recruiters specify  which has a drawback the resume might be packed with hidden keywords or buzzwords. Then its interesting to figure out how to get around that. What would be a more interesting way of solving this problem Maybe some kind of machine learning algorithm Then you have to train this beast, too. p  pSo I dont know how Ill do it yet.

Negative 1702 pIve searched a lot about taking screenshot of my OpenGL object on Android and come up with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3310990takingscreenshotofandroidopengl46668204666820thisa solution. It worked great but in my case I have camera view and opengl viewwith transparent background on top of camera view. So what I want to do is to get opengl screenshot with transparent background instead of black.  As I said I have tried link above and it worked but Im stuck with black background. Its little bit complicated to figure out how to get rid of the black background in this particular case.  Hope somebody could help me and asap if its possiblealso I think the solution is easy, Im just missing something simple. Thank you.p
Negative 1702 pI have a view in interface builder, and then a subview within that view.  I place the subview visually near the upper left corner within its parent.  I would therefore expect the x, y coordinates of the subviews frame to be something close to 20,20, but instead IB tells me it is something like 230,432.  If I then adjust the X, Y coords in the properties window to something like 20,20, the subview flies off the screen towards the upperleft...  What is the deal  BTW, it is an iPad specific view size, where the topparent view is sized 768x1004.p

Negative 1702 pIm building a WP7 VB.NET app and have a custom class, PinInfo, of which I have two ObservableCollections, TempPins and FavoritePins.p  pIn various parts of the app, I need a unique identifier to get a reference to a particular PinInfo in the collection, so at present, I assign an ID to the PinInfo when its added to the collection, then later get a reference to the pin via the ID.p  pFor example, if I create a button to delete a pin, I set its tag to the pins ID, then the button click handler reads the buttons tag to get the corresponding pin from the collection via LINQ.p  pI generate the ID by adding one to the lastassigned ID, but these lists are often modified i.e. items removed, so I end up with needlessly large ID numbers e.g. just a few items, with IDs in the thousands.p  pHow can I structure this betterp

So lets assume the following scenariosp  pA  1100 B  1215 is fine my validation accepts this as it should do A  1115 B  1100 is accepted because the hours are equal but otherwise shouldnt pass as the minutes arent validatedp  pHow would you ensure B is always equal to or greater than A where dropdowns are used I would if I could change this but not permitted to do so.p

Negative 1702 pRelating to my earlier question regarding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5166723annotatecodeinvs2010withoutchangingthatcodeAnnotate code in VS 2010 without changing that codea.  I have decided to try my hand at writing an extension for Visual Studio to allow the annotation of code under review without changing the code itself.  My primary requirement here is to anchor annotation data to code elements, literal lines of code in the simplest sense, blocks of code or statements in a more complex sense.  p  pI can subdivide this requirement into a logic part and a UI part, where UI part will provide a visual indication that a code element has been annotated, together with a means of accessing the annotations for that code, and a logic part, that identifies and tracks the code element through various changes made to the code that contains that element.  In my simple case of a line of code, this would have to track updates such as incrementing the line number when I line is added above the annotated line, etc.p  pWhat mechanisms are at my disposal, via the VS Extensibility API, for fulfilling mainly my logic requirement, and how do I go about getting started using thesep

Fast bandwidth to the client, but with long latency.p  pDoes every read call invoke a round trip back to the server to ask for more data  Or does the clientserver protocol recognize that subsequent reads on a remote file are often sequential, and as such, subsequent blocks are pushed down before the application has actually made a read call for it. Hence, subsequent read calls return faster because the data was prefetched and cached.p  pDo modern network file system protocols NFS, SMBSamba, any others make any optimizations like this.

Negative 1702 pI am making a list of view in my application that shows all installed applications in the users device.  It shows the name and the icon.  The list view takes very long to load and the UI is unresponsive while its loading.  I have seen the resources that have lazy load and async task tutorials but they all seem to fetch images from the internet.  I need to lazy load images that are in the system which are the application icons.  I dont know how to do this with async task either.  Can someone please help me lazy load or asynctask application icons.  This is a very essential part of my application and i would deeply appreciate it.  Thanks.p

Negative 1702 pIm currently building a registry explorer, mostly because I want to support some much better searching operations. Like find all and regular expressions. One problem Im facing is that some keys throw a security exception when opening. I HAVE TRIED running the app with administrator priviledges, my user account is an administrator also. I embedded a manifest with requireAdministrator requested priviledges. I have also tried setting the ClickOnce security settings to Full trust, which is incompatible with requireAdministrator, or so Visual Studio tells me.... Nothing seems to help with avoiding this exception.p  pI would just like to iterate over all of the keys. I do not wish to adddelete keys. If a user wishes to delete a key and does not have permission to do so, it would display an error message. I just want to be able to have unrestricted READ access. Is this possiblep  pFTR Im on Win7 x64 and using Vs2010u and project is written in C on .net 4.0. If regedit is capable of reading all keys even if it doesnt let you edit some of them. It would seem appropriate that we too can make an app to do the same thing. Though Im finding it very difficult, and there doesnt seem to be any real help on the www. Only linklink circles, yay.p  p[EDIT]p  pHeres the code that reads the keysp  precode    private void IterateSubKeysRegistryKeyModel key           var subKeys  key.Key.GetSubKeyNames         var values  key.Key.GetValueNames          foreach var valuename in values              try                  var valueKind  key.Key.GetValueKindvaluename                 var value  key.Key.GetValuevaluename                  key.Values.Addnew RegistryValueModelvaluename, value, valueKind                          catch                     foreach var keyname in subKeys              try                  var subkey  key.Key.OpenSubKey                     keyname,                      RegistryKeyPermissionCheck.ReadSubTree,                      RegistryRights.ReadKey                  key.SubKeys.Addnew RegistryKeyModelsubkey                          catch  Console.WriteLineError reading key 0, keyname                codepre

Negative 1702 pI want to display images in WPF, but using an actual image, instead of using the URL. The reason to this is because i want to Serialize images, so i can carry them around easily. How can i do this, if Image class is Source only Which means, uses URI . The idea would be very simple Serialize image, then, when deserialization done, it would load the image onto a controller like Image.  Is it even possible to, lets say i had the images serialized, then how could i even get their URI, even such a thing even exists This is very confusing. Hope for some true enlightenment...p  pI already found many code snippets that show how to serializedeserialize but honestly i havent been able to test them out yet, as the initial part of my plan is already on hold. Although, if anyone has a good clean link to it, id appreciate itp
Negative 1702 pI derived a class from UIView, only to realize that there are real limitations on its size due to memory. I have this UIView inside UIScrollView.p  pIs there a way for me to put something inside a scroll view that is not a UIViewderived class but into which I can still draw, and which can be very very largep  pI dont mind having to respond to exposerectangle events, like one does when using conventional windowing systems.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1702 pI am a newbie in doing spring MVC.  I was able to create a helloSpring sort of application but this was based on annotations. I removed annotations since I am still learning Spring MVC so I wanted to first learn XML config way but for some reason my jsp does not render once I remove the annotations part. I think I have all configs set correctly. Oddly my JSP modification does not even render on the page when it comes up so I hit enter on the address bar to confirm if Tomcat is not rendering a cached setting and it fails with 404.

Negative 1702 pIt seems the more popular frameworks use a front controller. I understand the benefits of a front controller reduces redundancy and simplifies extensibility, butp  pI want to know what PHP frameworks do NOT use a front controller. Additionally I am interested in those frameworks that use page controllers and that recommend using a real file directory structure for the urls as opposed to rewriting almost every url or using a mess of a query string. Additionally I am interested in knowing which of the frameworks that do not use a front controller implement MVC. Lastly, any additional details you can provide on the nonfrontcontroller frameworks would be useful, particularly what version of PHP it uses or requires. I know I can get this later information from other sites so it is not as important.p  pConsider a hrefhttptoys.lerdorf.comarchives38ThenoframeworkPHPMVCframework.htmlthe words of Rasmus Lerdorfa the original creator of PHPp  blockquote   pAs for MVC, if you use it carefully, it can be useful in a web   application. Just make sure you avoid the temptation of creating a   single monolithic controller. A web application by its very nature is   a series of small discrete requests. If you send all of your requests   through a single controller on a single machine you have just defeated   this very important architecture. Discreteness gives you scalability   and modularity. You can break large problems up into a series of very   small and modular solutions and you can deploy these across as many   servers as you like. You need to tie them together to some extent most   likely through some backend datastore, but keep them as separate as   possible. This means you want your views and controllers very close to   each other and you want to keep your controllers as small as possible.  Rasmus Lerdorfp blockquote  pUPDATE Many thanks to user a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers16668alexAlexa for the first of hopefully more answers. His answer is QCubed .. p  blockquote   premember that front controller index.php and MVC are separate   patterns. That is, you can have an MVC framework that does NOT   implement or require the front controller. My framework of choice,   QCubed, happens to be like that.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers16668alexAlexap blockquote  pNow if we can reopen this question then we can continue what we started and put together a list of frameworks that do not use a front controller. Please vote to reopen. Thank you.p

Negative 1702 pIm designing a new application, and there is a table with items that the users would like to uniquely identify with a number.  This table will have a surrogate key, which can be used for this purpose, however Im undecided if I should expose it to the users.  They will only use this id as readonly and lookups, and the application will handle the creation of the key behind the scenes.p  pThe idea is to avoid potential problems down the road.  If the key is an identity field, auto generated by the dbms, then you dont have control over the key. Im using NHibernate in my application, so I can have control over the key by using HiLo, as described a hrefhttpnhforge.orgblogsnhibernatearchive20090320nhibernatepoidgeneratorsrevealed.aspx relnofollowherea, which I intend to use.  In case it matters, the DBMS is Oracle.p  pWhat are some of the potential issues I could encounter down the road by exposing the key  p  ol liLets assume the users build a dependency on it by making some excel spreadsheets that use this key.  Could the key ever changeli liIf some records get lost in a database corruption or accident, and I want to avoid conflicts with old keys, couldnt I just adjust my starting point in NHibernate to skip the previously generated numbersli liWhat if the users want to change to some other methodology of identifying their records.  Lets say they want to start off with some meaningful character codes.  Could I not then, either show them a computed not stored identifier, or create a new alternate key column at any time that is based on my surrogate primary keyli ol  pIf someone can demonstrate a clear example of how exposing a managed surrogate primary key to user may become a problem down the road I will create an alternate key to present to the users, otherwise I will expose the surrogate primary key.p  pThanksp

Negative 1702 pIn our database a customer can have any number of drivers, any number of vehicles, any number of storage locations, any number of buildings at those locations, any number of comments, and so on. I need a query that returns strongallstrong of the customers information and right now the query is something likep  precodeSELECT  FROM Customer c INNER JOIN Driver d ON c.ID  d.CustomerID INNER JOIN Vehicle v ON c.ID  v.CustomerID codepre  pThe more that a customer has the bigger the result gets, and it grows exponentially because a cartesian product is being created here. 3 drivers, 3 vechiles creates 9 rows, and this is a very small example compared to what our real data is like. We actually have 10 different tables that can hold as many rows per customer as they want. The norm is 27 rows at least per table per customer. we have had as many as 60,000,000 rows returned 6 items each in 10 different tables, 610  60,466,176 and for our purposes 6 rows total would have given us all the data we needed if we could just strongemstickemstrong the 6 rows in each table together.p  pso in the smaller example, if 1 customer had 2 vehicles and 3 drivers and another customer had 2 vehicles and 1 drivers i would want a result set that looked likep  precodeCustomerID   DriverID  VehicleID 1            1         1 1 or NULL  2         2 1 or NULL  NULL      3 2            3         4 2 or NULL  4         NULL codepre  pInstead our query that joins every table together on CustomerID looks like thisp  precodeCustomerID  DriverID  VehicleID 1           1         1 1           1         2 1           1         3 1           2         1 1           2         2 1           2         3 2           3         4 2           4         4 codepre  pReally, what I want to do is justp  precodeSELECT  FROM Driver SELECT  FROM Vehicle codepre  pBecause all we are doing with the data is looping through the rows and formatting the information in a document. All drivers are listed, then all vehicles are listed. It makes no sense to do this crazy huge join when we dont have to, but its just an arbitrary requirement that it must return all the data in 1 result set from a stubborn superior who refuses to listen to reason. Since the columns are different a UNION isnt possible. im just hoping theres a way to stick them together horizontally instead of vertically.p  pAlso, Im using Microsoft SQL Server.p

Negative 1702 pThe default identifier generator for Postgresql in Hibernate is SequenceGenerator [1].  i.e. Hibernate will do codeSELECT nextvalhibernatesequencecode to generate an ID before doing an codeINSERT foo id, ... VALUES 123, ...code on session commit.p  pHowever, PostgreSql supports autoincrement id columns see e.g. [2], and the default generator for all other databases which support autoincrement is to use that feature [3], and to perform inserts omitting the id value and to query the database for the new id before session commit, but within the sessions transaction.p  pI have seen some recent discussion [4] suggesting that the former strategy is better in general, due to the insertbeforesessioncommit mismatch.p  pIf SequenceGenerator is better as per [4], why is it not the default for databases which support it see [3]p  pIf IdentityGenerator is better, why does PostgreSql explicitly choose SequenceGenerator when Postgres does support the former as per [2]p  pI tried to find the history of the decision to override the default in the Postgres dialect see [1], but I couldnt find the relevant commit in GitHub.

Negative 1702 pAs a school project i have taken up making an angry birds clone in matlab. After working on it a little bit, i have realized that perhaps i bit more then i could chew.p  pCurrently i am working on the physics of it, and while i understand the mechanics behind the game collisions, inertia and whatnot i dont know how i will implement it in the game. I am new to programming but i like it and have caught on to it fairly quickly.p  pIn angry birds we are dealing with collisions between several OBBs and i have an algorithm for detecting collisions. I have a function that checks all the corners of every box and looks to see if it is within another box. I realize this is not the best way to do it but since i couldnt visualize the separating axis theorem, i chose not to use it.p  pWhen the collision happens, the box is penetrating into another box, when this happens i do a liner interpolation between its previous point and the current point. I do this to all colliding points in one instance this is my method to resolve multiple collisions. Using the interpolation i detect the first collision that takes place and i implement a collision response. p  pMy issue currently is that when there is one box sitting on top of another, this method doesnt work so well, because at every instance the top box penetrates into the bottom one very slightly, and i bounce it back. This causes my entire thing to stop, because i go back in time, solve the collision, and then in the next instance the collision is happening again.p  pMy question is, how do i solve this problem of multiple boxes sitting on top of one another. p  pI have looked at all of the articles on physics by a hrefhttpwww.wildbunny.co.uk relnofollowhttpwww.wildbunny.co.uka and tried to understand his method but while i understand what he does, i have no clue how he does it. I also do not know any action script so much of his code is gibberish to me.p  pI have looked through several other guides on the internet but none of them seem to make sense to me.p  pHere is what would be of great help to me, if someone could tell me what sort of method is commonly used to implement the graphics of a game like angrybirds, specifically the multiple collisions method is mine good enough or do i need to do speculative contacts like wildbunny talks about in his blog, and the box resting on box problem.p  pIs this project difficult to do withing two weeksp

So my assumption would be that the Spring DI runtime uses two kind of identifiers for each namespace the strongxmlnsstrong identifier to uniquely identify the namespace used as an opaque string and the strongschemaLocationstrong identifier to uniquely identify the schema version for that namespace again used as an opaque string. I.e. the strongschemaLocationstrong is actually used in a contorted way  as that doesnt seem to be the intention of the w3c documents to version the namespace. Moreover, in such a case, why doesnt the Spring DI runtime complain about the lack of a strongschemaLocationstrong for the strongpstrong namespace. Is my mental model correct p

Negative 1702 pI would like to know if it is possible to inject a binary inside a memory process with windbg Hooking windbg on the process to potentially replace the instructions of the original binary or add the other binary instructions to be run by the process as well as injecting the dlls Would it be possible to script thisp  pBasically I would like to know how much can be done with windbg to a process and how much of the process could be modified. Could I technically use windbg to map a whole binary and its dlls into an existing processp
Negative 1702 pthe reason for the link error is clear, some lib is missing within my link procedure. Unfortunately it seems OpenCV 2.4.1 has changed its internal structure, so the resolutions I find with Googlethe Stackoverflow search function only recommend me to link against libraries that no longer exist cv.lib or cxcore.lib.p  pI could solve some of my linking problems by using opencvcore241.lib and opencvhighgui241.lib, but in where are cvResize and cvCvtColor located atp
Negative 1702 pIm attempting to create a CustomControl which will have strongvariousstrong properties affected by an enum found in a ViewModel. The CustomControl created will be called within a View.p  pI would like the enum binding to change a couple of things within the Control, these includep  ul liChanging an Images source images changed to are static within a folder created inside the CustomControl Library,li liAlter a TextBlocks Text property, again, the text options will be static between one of X amount of cases X being the number of possible enum statesalso doesnt change.li ul  pKeep in mind, these two DPs will be linked e.g. if bound enum is case x, the image source will change strongandstrong the displayed text.  Basically, the two exposed DPs here will be bound to the strongsame enumstrong, but use it differently.p  hr  pSo, my strongquestionstrong is, what would be the best way to carry what is described abovep  pIve already thought about two possible ways p  ol liExpose useful DP types and bind these properties to the same enum e.g Property1Binding someEnum Property2Binding someEnum and also provide a ValueConvertor to convert these enums to useful types which the CustomControl can then use,li liOr, expose a single DP which accepts an enum and then changes the properties somewhere else within the CustomControl code, depending on the value of the bound enumli ol  pI am fairly comfortable with carrying out option 1 with a value convertor in the Views codebehind file. However, I would like to avoid doing it this way as it would make the control less independant. p  pRegarding option two, Im not entirely sure how to do it this way so articles or a small explanation would help if you feel this is the way to go  Possibly implementing INoitifyPropertyChanged on the DP so the control knows its value has been changed when the Bound enum changesp  pAlso, I am not limited to doing it the two ways described, if you feel there is a better way, please suggest itp  pI am using WPF C in conjunction with MVVM architecture MVVM Light Toolkit.p  pQuick Note I would like to avoid altering the ViewModel  The exposed enum and all logic there should remain as it is unless absoloutely necessaryp  pThanks in advance for your replies and I will attempt to update this question as much as possible with responses and updates regarding personal progress with the issue as well as possible extra information which has been requestedp
Negative 1702 pI have an codeintcode property     p  precodepropertynonatomic int stackTop codepre  pand when it gets synthesized, it has a default value of 0. I want to set this default value to 1.p  pI tried overriding the setter method like thisp  precodesythesize stackTop  stackTop  voidsetStackTopintstackTop      stackTop  1  codepre  pand then the initial value is 1 instead of 0, but its not changing when the variable codestackTopcode changes in the program. For example, I have codeself.stackTopcode, but its not getting incremented. With the nonoverriden setter method, that statement does change the value. What am I doing wrong Whats the solutionp
Negative 1702 pDoes anyone have any experience with this particular stack Im working on a web project that will eventually contain an extremely large amount of data and was trying to get Solr to play nicely with some simple Mongodb entries but I have found little to no information about it. I found this a hrefhttpblog.knuthaugen.no201004cookingwithmongodbandsolr.htmlhttpblog.knuthaugen.no201004cookingwithmongodbandsolr.htmla which is mongodb  solr  php, but Im struggling to see how I would use node similarly. Anybody have any insight Id greatly appreciate it. If this is a dumb thing to try to implement, feel free to let me know as wellp  pFound this library a hrefhttpsgithub.comtjgilliesnodelucenehttpsgithub.comtjgilliesnodelucenea p  pDoesnt look like there is much documentation there but Ill give it a go.p  pUpdate So a quick fix not ideal that worked was to use a Perl module for lucene and then using the child process functionality in Node.js, I was able to insert and search for my data inside of lucene. So for a workaround, it does the trick.p
Negative 1702 pI am working in C .net. I have a custom control that shows the contents of a dataBase with a bindingsource in between. I use labels in the control to bind the text property to the data in the dataset through a bindingsource with the following codep  precodemycontrolgtControls[i]gtDataBindingsgtAddgcnew SystemWindowsFormsBindingLText,  thisgtbindingSourceRelRevData, mycolumn,true, SystemWindowsFormsDataSourceUpdateModeOnValidation, nullptr, Lt codepre  pPlease, note that the code is an excerpt of a loop that iterates on all the controls, therefore the control[i], which would be the label control, and the variable mycolumn, which would be the column of the dataset to be binded to. It works fine apart of an unwanted behaviour that I havent yet found the way to change. The sofware runs in different parts of the world but the records must be in local time. The database stores the time in localtime as a DateTime value but the dataBinding interprets it as UTC and shows the time in the label with the timezone difference applied. For example, if the data is 24062012 1640, it will show 24062012 2240 in a 4 hours difference time zone. I need it to show just the value as it was stored, without changes.p  pI can think of different ways to go arround, but non elegant capture the text update event of the label and undo the change... Store the date as String in the DB... fill manually the labels... ...p  pIf I bind without formating, it will not change the value, but then I have the raw datetime string on the label...p  pPlease, any magic I am missing in the binding so that it will not assume it has to change the time zonep  pThank you very much in advance Adanp
Negative 1702 pI recently bought a wildcard ssl certificate to move my site to https.

I have checked MATLAB function a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.nlhelptoolboximagesrefregionprops.html relnofollowregionpropsa, and understand how MATLAB can do that. I also notice that Opencv has similar function to do that a hrefhttpopencv.willowgarage.comwikicvBlobsLibcvBlobsLib1 relnofollowCBlobGetEllipsea. However, although I understand how they obtain the result by reading the code, the fundamental theory behind it is still unclear to me. I am therefore wondering whether there are some standard algorithms to do the job. Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pBased on the comments, I reorganized my question in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiImagemoment relnofollowimage moment Wikipediaa the calculation formula of the longest axis angle is p  pimg srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediaenmathb41b41dc6e55585b57744f0719e44122e5a.png altformulap  pHowever, in the MATLAB function a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.nlhelptoolboximagesrefregionprops.html relnofollowregionpropsa, the codes are as followsp  precode     Calculate orientation.     if uyy gt uxx         num  uyy  uxx  sqrtuyy  uxx2  4uxy2         den  2uxy     else         num  2uxy         den  uxx  uyy  sqrtuxx  uyy2  4uxy2     end codepre  pThis implementation is inconsistent with the formula in Wikipedia.

Negative 1702 pConsider a C struct that represents an entry in a singly linked list.  It contains a pointer to some arbitrary data, the size of that data, and a way to find the next Entryp  precodetypedef struct   unsigned char data   unsigned char dataSize   unsigned char nextEntry  Entry codepre  pNext, consider the following collection of entries and the data that they representp  precodeunsigned char dataA[3] unsigned char dataB[16] unsigned char dataC[17]  Entry entryA  dataA, sizeofdataA, 3 Its important for 3 to match up with the index of entryB once its put into MasterList below. Entry entryB  dataB, sizeofdataB, 4 Likewise Entry entryC  dataC, sizeofdataC, 0 0 terminates the linked list Entry emptyEntry  void0, 0, 0  Entry MasterList[8]   entryA,     Index 0  Contains dataA and points to Index 3 as the next Entry in a linked list emptyEntry, Index 1  Unused or used for something else emptyEntry, Index 2  Unused entryB,     Index 3  Contains dataB and points to Index 5 as the next Entry in a linked list entryC,     Index 4  Contains dataC and terminates the linked list emptyEntry, Index 5  Unused emptyEntry, Index 6  Unused emptyEntryIndex 7  Unused codepre  pMy Question Can you think of a way to figure out the value for nextEntry automatically at compile time  Right now theres a huge potential for bugs if someone shuffles the order of the entries in the MasterList or adds some other data and offsets some of entries.  We catch all of the bugs with unit testing or integration testing, but its inevitable that any change to the MasterList ends up getting checked in twice.  Once when someone edits it and a 2nd time to patch up the linked list indicies when the code fails testing.p  pMy initial instinct is no, thats idiotic and why would you even try this but Ive seen some pretty impressive CMacro wizardry in the past.  I also believe that any macro wizardry would be even worse to maintain than the above, but I figure its worth a shot, rightp  pstrongClarificationstrong  Im stuck with the MasterList array and not a proper linked list because the consumer of the information is expecting it to be this way.  In fact, theres other information in there that isnt part of the linked list that needs to be at a fixed index.  Then, on top of that, theres this linked list data.  The reason its a linked list is to make it somewhat immune to getting shoved around as other elements with fixed indices are added.  For example, if it turned out that we needed to shove in a specific string at Index 3, entryB and entryC could get pushed out of the way, but could still be discovered by starting at the linked list head fixed at Index 0 and walking the list.p

Negative 1702 pI am designing a small threading framework, and id like that threading framework to be as transparent as possible to the final code, in such a way that it barely affects the syntax of linear code.

In a manner of speaking this IS .Nets awaitasync model, but id like to redo it my own way so it can be used across all .Net versions, and possibly be ported to JavaXYZ languages.p  pThe problem The abc and def calls would be evaluated by the compiler BEFORE feeding their return values to the lt operator, what i really want though, is to be able to have those function calls fed to the operator so i can defer execution of them until the pipeline thread is ready to do so.p  pThe rationale Unlike the asyncawait model, you wouldnt have to modify your methods so they can be asynced, and you could use any method with the transactioned methods anyway. Another advantage would be that with erasing a couple lines your code would be back to being linear Not that the async model doesnt have this advantage, but its worth mentioning it anywaysp  pAny ideasp

Negative 1702 pI am trying to use a combination of Domain Driven Design with Test Driven Development for this application I am building in ASP.NET MVC 3. My archictecture is set up with Repositories, Domain Models, View Models, Controllers and Views. All validation will be handled in the view model. I set up my view model to inherit from IValidatableObject so that my validation attributes and my custom validation that i set up in the Validate method are both executed when my controller method calls ModelState.IsValid. The problem I am running into is accessing my repository in the Validate method of my view model. I need to access the repository to check for duplicate records in the database. It seems like the best idea would be to create a property of IRepository type and set that property by passing injecting my repository into the constructor of the view model. For examplep  precodepublic class UserViewModel  IValidatableObject         public UserViewModelUser user, IUserRepository userRepository                       FirstName  user.FirstName               LastName  user.LastName               UserRepository  userRepository               UserName  user.UserName                public string UserName  get set         public string FirstName  get set         public string LastName  get set         public IUserRepository UserRepository  get set         public IEnumerableltValidationResultgt Validate                    UserCriteria criteria  new UserCriteria  UserName  this.UserName             IListltUsergt users  UserRepository.SearchUserscriteria             if users  null ampamp users.count gt 0                            yield return new ValidationResultUser with username   this.UserName   already exists.                      codepre  pDo you guys think this is a good ideap

The output is that the sprite does appear on the screen, and it moves when I provide key and mouse input, but the problem is is that its leaving trails. Which is why I created a rectangle to trail the sprite rectangle which is supposed to be filled with white every time the game loop loops. But it doesnt. At least, not until I minimize the window, and pull it up again, all the trails disappear and the background becomes white instead of black. But when I move the image, the trails start forming again. I minimize, they disappear as supposed to.p

Negative 1702 pIm building an app for which Id like to reuse 99 of the code in iOS and OSX. Just asking for a sanity check.p  pstrongEditstrong A bit more information about my project that may affect some of the responses My app involves a customizable presentation thats primarily intended for iOS devices. The OSX component is actually a designer for the customizable presentation  a way of specifying what is to be presented on a selected iOS device. That is, the OSX app will be a completely normal OSX app that allows the user to choose, configure, and position some elements for the iOS device  and that displays a preview of that presentation. Of course, I want the preview to resemble the iOS rendering as closely as possible without actually invoking the iOS simulator, which I dont expect to be available on all OSX devices. So Ive designed the presentation as a view that should be rendered asnearlyidenticallyaspossible on both OSX and iOS.p  pTo this end, I started in iOS with some simple viewdrawing stuff, and now Im reconfiguring the code so that I can port it to OSX. My strategy so far is to replace all references to UIView  UIWindow  UIFont  UIColor etc. with View  Window  Font  Color, etc. For the iOS version, Ill include a file called Wrapper.h like thisp  precodedefine Device UIDevice define Application UIApplication define ApplicationMain UIApplicationMain define ApplicationDelegate UIApplicationDelegate define Responder UIResponder define Window UIWindow codepre  p...with NSbased definitions for OSX NSWindows, etc. I know that a few details will change like Y coordinates in views, but I can deal with that.p  pThe only components that I dont think I can map like that are gesture recognizers, since OSX has no equivalent. Im planning to make them a generic call thats implemented in the iOS wrapper, and stubbed out in the OSX wrapper, since I really dont need tap events in OSX.p  pGood idea Bad idea Is there a better way to tackle this Thanks...p

Negative 1702 pThe situation Ill describe is occurring on an iPad 4 ARMv7s, using posix libs to mutex lockunlock. Ive seen similar things on other ARMv7 devices, though see below, so I suppose any solution will require a more general look at the behaviour of mutexes and memory fences for ARMv7.p  pPseudo code for the scenariop  pstrongThread 1  Producing Datastrongp  precodevoid ProduceFunction    MutexLock   int TempProducerIndex  mSharedProducerIndex  Take a copy of the int member variable for Producers Index   mSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index    mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable   MutexUnlock  codepre  pstrongThread 2  Consuming Datastrongp  precodevoid ConsumingFunction     while mConsumerIndex  mSharedProducerIndex      doWorkOnData mSharedArray[mConsumerIndex]     codepre  pPreviously when the problem cropped up on iPad 2, I believed that codemSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndexcode was not being performed atomically, and hence changed to use an codeAtomicCompareAndSwapcode to assign codemSharedProducerIndexcode. This has worked up until this point, but it turns out I was wrong and the bug has come back. I guess the fix just changed some timing.p  pI have now come to the conclusion that the actual problem is an out of order execution of the writes within the mutex lock, i.e. if either the compiler or the hardware decided to reorderp  precodemSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex   Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable codepre  p... top  precodemSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable mSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  codepre  p... and then the consumer interleaved the producer, the data would not have yet been written when the consumer tried to read it.p  pAfter some reading on memory barriers, I therefore thought Id try moving the signal to the consumer outside the codemutexunlockcode, believing that the unlock would produce a memory barrierfence which would ensure codemSharedArraycode had been written top  precodemSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData   Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  MutexUnlock mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable codepre  pThis, however, still fails, and leads me to question if a codemutexunlockcode will definitely act as a write fence or notp  pIve also read a hrefhttpwww.hpl.hp.compersonalHansBoehmmiscslidesreordering.pdf relnofollowan article from HPa which suggested that compilers could move code into but not out of codecritseccodes. So even after the above change, the write of codemSharedProducerIndexcode could be before the barrier. Is there any mileage to this theoryp  pBy adding an explicit fence the problem goes awayp  precodemSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  OSMemoryBarrier mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable codepre  pI therefore think I understand the problem, and that a fence is required, but any insight into the behaviour of the unlock and why it doesnt appear to be performing a barrier would be really useful.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pRegarding the lack of a mutex in the consumer thread Im relying on the write of the codeint mSharedProducerIndexcode being a single instruction and therefore hoping the consumer would read either the new or old value. Either are valid states, and providing that codemSharedArraycode is written in sequence i.e. prior to writing codemSharedProducerIndexcode this would be OK, but from what has been said so far, I cant reply on this.p  pBy the same logic it appears that the current barrier solution is also flawed, as the codemSharedProducerIndexcode write could be moved inside the barrier and could therefore potentially be incorrectly reordered.p  pIs it recommended to add a mutex to the consumer, just to act as a read barrier, or is there a codepragmacode or instruction for disabling outoforder execution on the producer, like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEnforceInOrderExecutionofIO relnofollowcodeEIEIOcodea on PPCp

Negative 1702 pI have a class of which there may be many instances on a mobile device, so Im trying to minimize the size. One of my fields is a DrawTarget that indicates whether drawing operations are being ignored, queued to a path or drawn to the display. I would like it to take a single byte or less since there are only 3 possible values, but I would also like it to be friendly code so I dont have hardcoded numbers all over. One thought is to use an enum likep  precodepublic enum DrawTarget      Invisible,     Path,     Canvas  codepre  pBut from what I read, a Java enum doesnt allow you to specify the memory layout  I cant request that the enum values represent a bytesize value  and I guess enum values end up being integersized values in Java.p  pSo I thought about maybe making an implicit conversion operator in the enum... is this possible in Java Or is my best option to implement something like this within the enump  precodepublic static DrawTarget fromValuebyte value      switch value      case 0         return Invisible     case 1         return Path     default         return Canvas       codepre  pand then call DrawTarget.fromValue wherever I want to access the valuep  pOr should I just create a singlebyte class since apparently from what I read in my research on this enums are basically just special classes in Java anywayp  precodepublic class DrawTarget      public static final byte Invisible  0     public static final byte Path  1     public static final byte Canvas  2  codepre  pBut how to I represent the value of an enum instance if I use that last solution I still need a way to allow the  operator to accept one of the static fields of the class... like a conversion constructor or an assignment operator overload.p  pI suspect, however, that any class object, being a reference type, will take more than a byte for each instance. Is that truep

Negative 1702 pOkay, I am having a bit of an issue trying to solve some problems, and I am trying to figure out what a good design pattern to use would be for fixing this problem.p  pI have a class called Kit. Inside this class, there are methods for describing what to do when you want to give a person this kit. This info does not change per person, but I cant make it static since when I use Kit as a superclass, each kit will have different info for what to do when it gives a person that kit.p  pI also have a class called KitsPlayer, inside of this there is a field that will store the current Kit that the player is using along with other video.p  pMy issue is that, for some more advanced kits I want to be able to store emperplayerem data instance data for the kits. So what I was planning to do is if I have an advanced kit called AdvancedKit that extends Kit, when the player selects that kit, it will set the Kit inside KitsPlayer to a new AdvancedKit instance. This is so that I can store the instance data for that player which is specific to that kit. My issue is the data that doesnt need to be specific per player. The code that tells the computer how to give the player that kit doesnt get changed by any of the instance data, and remains the same. I dont want to recreate that same data every time I create a new instance of Kit for storing inside KitsPlayer, is there any ways I can avoid this Sorry if I didnt explain it very well, it is a little bit confusing.p  pThanksp
Negative 1702 pI have an app that uses an codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to grab various results from a database and display them in a codeUITableViewCellcode. For artistic reasons, at all times I want alternating cells to be left and right oriented, much like a conversation in codeMessagescode.p  pIm currently achieving this by using an codeintegercode called codeentryIndexPathcode, which is incremented and then used in an codeifcode statement inside codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode to determine whether the cell should be left or right aligned based on whether that integer is odd or even.p  pMy problem is that when scrolling back up the table, this leftright assignment can get confused, and a cell that has just scrolled off can be reassigned when reappearing from the top, since codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode is being called, the counter is being incremented.p  pI need a surefire way to ensure that when a new set of results is gotten from the FRC, that the leftright values are assigned correctly and firmly. I know that I need to do this outside of codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode, but Im struggling to see where I strongshouldstrong do it. Any ideas, or suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrong Id also point out that my managed objects dont currently have a LeftRight variable or anything like that, so creating one would be pretty awkward, recreating lots and lots of data, etc. If there a means of doing it without that, thatd be ideal.p

Negative 1702 pI would like to know if there is a Javascript counterpart to the PHP oppensslencrypt and openssldecrypt functions.p  pI have developed a unique combination of PHP and AJAX where a user can log in to a website using their username and password and be authenticated without the username or password even being transmitted to the server.  The point is, both the server and the user have a nevertransmitted secret key that can be used as an encryption key.p  pemI mention this because many of the answers I have found here are arguments about why anyone needs to do this, because any secret key that you use will have to be transmitted.  Not the case here, so please dont comment if you are a naysayer.emp  pWhat I am really looking for is two sets of string encryptiondecryption functions that are compatible between PHP and Javascript, using a secret key.

Here is a short description of what I try to accomplish.p  pThe MRpt has a tablix that displays some data as below For each PartNumber in MRpt, the SRpt will display the history of credit return approvalp  precodePartNumber AskedPrice AskedQuantity ApprovedPrice ApprovedQty PN1             2.00            50          1.50          50     InvoiceNumber InvoicePrice InvoiceQty ApprovedPrice ApproveQty     240204               24.25         70          0.50         50     220203               25.50       1570          2.50       1500  PN3            50.00            20         27.50          20     InvoiceNumber InvoicePrice InvoiceQty ApprovedPrice ApproveQty     240204               60.25        100         30.50         70     220201               50.50       2000         26.50       1500     220109               40.50       1000         20.50       1000 codepre  pI need to pass to the SRpt these values from the MRpt datasets ds1.CustomerID, ds1.StartDate, ds1.EndDate, ds2.PartNumber. p  pIs it possible If so, how do I go about to do this Where should I place the SRpt so it will be shown as above illustration. Im currently getting error SubReport could not be shown. If I run the SRpt alone, it displays data correctly.p  pPlease help.p  pI added some screen shots so you guys can help if I did something wrong.p  pThis is the subreport design view img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRAoxU.jpg altSubreport design viewp  pThis is the subreport properties from master report img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSS7YV.jpg altSubreport propertiesp  pThis is how I hook up the parameters img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC1nCy.jpg altHooking up parameters BillToID img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGyLei.jpg altPart Number img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcp1Lx.jpg altStartDate and EndDate img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt8n79.jpg altAdditional parameter to diplay in subreportp
Negative 1702 pI want to display the name of data types, which were used at least 10 times throughout the database, with the number of different tables they were used in, ordered by the latter. While tinkering, I got to this pointp  precodeselect datatype, countdistinct tablename count from alltabcols group by datatype having count gt 10 order by count desc codepre  pwith outputp  precodeVARCHAR2 1920 NUMBER   1435 ... codepre  pwhich is wrong, because views, etc. are included and I only got 125 tables in the database. However if I tryp  precodeselect datatype, select countdistinct t.tablename                    from alltables t                    where t.tablename in tablename count from alltabcols group by datatype having count gt 10 order by count desc codepre  pI getp  precodeLONG         125 SDOGEOMETRY 125 ... and so on codepre  pwhich is also wrong. Clearly this is because of the subquery, more specific the codewherecode clause. I thought that codetablenamecode contains only the table names for the current group Is there anything wrong with my thinking How would you solve thisp  pFWIW, this is homework, so some rough pointers suffice. We are using a clone of the internet movie data base.p
Negative 1702 pI have a problem with Ajax in WordPress.p  pLets say I have an Ajax script that loads code.phpcode script. I have codeREQUEST[id]code thats WordPress post id in that script and thats all.p  pI can write custom loop and get pagesposts. Thats not a problem.p  pBut I need to load WordPress core, hierarchy system like a normal page. I have a lot of custom code that depends on codepostgtIDcode in codepage.phpcode.p  pSo I need to pass id variable from Ajax script and load codepage.phpcode or codesingle.phpcode.p  pIs that even possiblep
Negative 1702 pIm really struggling with this and I cant seem to get it right.p  pI have a Liferay portlet that I have been trying to place in a custom category but it keeps putting it in the Undefined category. Ive setup my liferaydisplay.xml with a hard coding to test but it still doesnt do it. Note I am using maven instead of ant for build and dependencies. The portlet works fine it is just not in the category I want. Once built the liferaydisplay.xml is in the WEBINF folder which I believe is where it is meant to be. Below is an example of the file.p  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltDOCTYPE display PUBLIC LiferayDTD Display 6.1.0EN httpwww.liferay.comdtdliferaydisplay610.dtdgt  ltdisplaygt     ltcategory nameHellogt         ltportlet idHello Portletgtltportletgt     ltcategorygt ltdisplaygt codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1702 pI have a Rails app where the Google Charts graphs gather user data from an external server. There is a method in the user model for getting this data from the server, which is called in the usersshow controller method.p  pThe codeshowcode method returns a default JSON which I then parse out using codeusershelpercode methods.

When I do that, the entire page refreshes but the graphs are generated with the correct data timeframe specified in the form.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is for the graph data to update within the page, and then I can call a rerender of the graph when the form is submitted.

Negative 1702 pI am using Eclipse dynamic web project with tomcat 7. I am extremely new at this and slowly working through tutorials.p  pI am trying to make a simple webapp where a user enters information which is used to generate a QR code. I can make the image and save it to the WebContent folder. I want to show this image to the user and store it. Eventually I will have an account for each user with their stored QR codes and other images. I have an index.html that takes the information through a form and passes it to a servlet that creates the image and saves it in my WebContent folder, then builds a simple HTML to show the image. However, the image is not shown unless I tell eclipse to refresh the project. My guess is that eclipse doesnt know about the new image file until it gets refreshed, and for some reason the HTML generated by the servlet isnt picking up on the image even though its in the right place. p  pThe answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15032030saveafileatruntimeinsidewebcontentinjavawebprojectherea suggests storing the data outside the webapp folders and streaming it. This is something I am unfamiliar with. I have tried to store the image in an outside folder and refer to it using both absolute and relative paths from the WebContent folder to the image file, neither works. And the QR code I was able to show from inside the WebContent folder doesnt update when I give it different data to build the image from, I have to refresh the project in eclipse even though the file name and location is the same. When I use the file browser to open the image file it has the new data.p  pI am asking for very basic help, Im not incompetent but Ive never done internet programming before and this is a lot to learn. In general I need to know how to get and store data and generate new data and then call it back up dynamically to display to the user.

Negative 1702 pIve been trying to work out the best practices on storing nonvolatile values.p  pA common solution is to store it in a database, for example if you are storing types of something, you then have a structure for normalization.p  pHowever, my problem is that this data will hardly ever change, and even if it does, the occasion will be so rare that it would prove more efficient to hard code it a class of constants for example.p  pThe second problem is that there is a risk if small that the data will be deleted, and finally, every installation would require this data be created first.p  pI am trying to build a system that does not depend on data to at least function not break, I do feel that data should be dependent on code to give it meaning, opposed to code being dependent on data to function.p  pHas anyone found an elegant methodology to thisp  pI have tagged as PHP, Symfony and Doctrine because these are the tools I am working with, the question is generally applicationframework agnostic, but if you can give examples based on those tools it would be helpful.p  pEditp  pAn example off the top of my head could be storing product types in a database.  I dont mean categories of products, much lower level.  Is the product material something you can touch, a service, information, or digital media.p  pOut of the physically possible variants that I can think of, only these four exist.  It feels meaningless to create a table for these types, but it also feels inelegant to hold a field in the products table stating which it is.p  pBased on which one it is, four very different branches of functions are possible, and these functions would be hard coded with some level of scalability obviously.p

Negative 1702 pI am trying to find an easy way of implementing naming standards in my ASP.NET MVC project. Essentially, I just want to ensure that parameters are camel case, or something. Is there functionality built into Visual Studio Express or Pro for this purpose, or would I need to view all the source files and update by handp  pUPDATE As suggested, Im going with Resharper. Although it costs money, so if anyones on a budget, CodeRush is freeish.p

Negative 1702 pI would like to be able to determine the aspect ratio of a Windows Phone 8 hardware camera. From what I understand there are three device screen sizes now, so Im not sure if this affects the device camera aspect ratios or if they are standard across all phone models The reason I need to determine the camera aspect ratio is to be able to resize images appropriately once a picture is taken. The default images using CameraCaptureTask are much to large for my purposes. With using the CameraCaptureTask within my application, all I receive back is the stream of image data. I was manually trying to determine the aspect ratio from this, although with testing with a Nokia 920 in the default 169 aspect ratio, the ratio I determined makes no sense, it equals 222125. What I am doing is as followsp  pMainPage.xaml.csp  precodepublic int GCDint a, int b              while a  0 ampamp b  0                      if a gt b                 a  b             else                 b  a                  if a  0             return b         else             return a       private void cameraTaskCompletedobject sender, PhotoResult e              if e.TaskResult  TaskResult.OK                      BitmapImage bmi  new BitmapImage             bmi.SetSourcee.ChosenPhoto             MessageBox.Showbmi.PixelWidth.ToString  x  bmi.PixelHeight.ToString              var gcd  GCDbmi.PixelWidth, bmi.PixelHeight             var result  string.Format01, bmi.PixelWidth  gcd, bmi.PixelHeight  gcd              WriteableBitmap wb  new WriteableBitmapbmi             WriteableBitmap wb             Stream stream  new MemoryStream              switch result                              case 34                     wb  new WriteableBitmap480, 640                     wb.SetSourcee.ChosenPhoto                      wb.SaveJpegstream, 480, 640, 0, 100                     break                 case 43                     wb  new WriteableBitmap640, 480                     wb.SaveJpegstream, 640, 480, 0, 100                     break                 case 916                     wb  new WriteableBitmap448, 800                     wb.SaveJpegstream, 448, 800, 0, 100                     break                 case 169                     wb  new WriteableBitmap800, 448                     wb.SaveJpegstream, 800, 448, 0, 100                     break                 default                     wb  null                     return                           stream.Seek0, SeekOrigin.Begin             stream.Dispose              var capturedPicture  new CapturedPicturee.OriginalFileName, stream               codepre  pMy results thus far are as follows.

But when Im trying to update my poster and push edit, my form is coming in and I see all the fields that I had when I was creating poster. But if while CREATING poster I added a pic, when I see EDIT form, I have opened link for adding a pic. And if I use it, its ok, but when I just edit my Name,for example, and save it without adding new pic, my show.html.erb shows me my previous pic and a sign of broken image after it. If I had two images, while updating poster, rails is trying to make me to add two more images or adds two brokenimage signs itself. Any ideasif you understood what youve read abovepli lipThe person who is checking my app says that I forgot to add some keys in my posterimagesattributes image in the controller in posterparams. I found here, in SOF, that it should be enough, but he says that its enough for creating poster, but not for edit and delete actions. Any ideas what else should I write in posterparams Thankspli ol

Negative 1702 pHi I wrote a very simple C program to use the C Regex from command line instead of relying on the MS Word search and replace. The problem is that when I use rn as a replacement string in Regex.Replace emthrough Console.ReadLineem it replaces with the th 4 characters rn instead of a real carriage returnnewline. However, if I write codestring replace rncode it works as intended, i.e. replaces the string with a carriage returnnewline. An Example input string would be Woodcock, american followed by rn. As the code is it produces Woodstockrn.

Negative 1702 pThis is very weird behavior of Visual studio and TFS. I am using Visual Studio 2012 and TFS 2012. We have a large number of projects and solutions in the source control. p  pLets assume I have no pending changes.p  pWhenever I open solutions which are present on source control all projects are loaded. And not a single project is checkedout for edit. I can see lock icon with the projects in the solution explorer.p  pNow I create a new solution and add projects from the source control to this solution, I face weird behavior. Some of the projects are automatically checked out and I havent did any change to it. And this happens to only few projects instead of all projects.

Negative 1702 pIm working on internationalization and I was wondering if there is a way to change a threads locale using MFC with C. The reason is that some countries can have a short date format of ddMMMyyyy and I want to be able to detect that in our application and then modify the threads locale to something like ddMMyyyy instead of using ddMMMyyyy.p  pLet me explain more of what Im trying to do. I know that I can format individual dates. My goal is to modify locale info for short date format for all  threads in my MFC application. Ive already done this in a ASP.NET web app with C by using CurrentThread and setting its CurrentCulture to a new CultureInfo object that Ive cloned and modified so that the short date format is different. Im just wondering if something similar can be done but instead using MFC and C.p  pThanks p

Negative 1702 pIm new to C, WPF and MVVM and trying to figure out how to solve the following problem I have a Datagrid which is bound to an ObservableCollection. This ObservableCollection consists of a struct, which has multiple fields, one of those fields is a string called clientName. I have a button which raises a command. This command requires the clientName to execute properly. p  pI solved this by using a property which is bound to the first selected item of the datagrid. By pressing the button, the command is fired without passing the clientName directly to the command. Instead it simply uses the selection property I made.p  pHow can I pass the datagrids current selection to the command when pressing the button without using a property to store the selected itemp

Negative 1702 pI have a table which contains a standard autoincrementing ID, a type identifier, a number, and some other irrelevant fields. When I insert a new object into this table, the number should autoincrement based on the type identifier.p  pHere is an example of how the output should lookp  precodeid      typeid     number 1       1           1 2       1           2 3       2           1 4       1           3    5       3           1 6       3           2 7       1           4 8       2           2 codepre  pAs you can see, every time I insert a new object, the number increments according to the typeid i.e. if I insert an object with typeid of 1 and there are 5 objects matching this typeid already, the number on the new object should be 6.p  pIm trying to find a performant way of doing this with huge concurrency. For example, there might be 300 inserts within the same second for the same typeid and they need to be handled sequentially.p  h2Methods Ive tried alreadyh2  h3PHPh3  pThis was a bad idea but Ive added it for completeness. A request was made to get the MAX number for the item type and then add the number  1 as part of an insert. This is quick but doesnt work concurrently as there could be 200 inserts between the request for MAX and that particular insert leading to multiple objects with the same number and typeid.p  h3Lockingh3  pManually locking and unlocking the table before and after each insert in order to maintain the increment. This caused performance issues due to the number of concurrent inserts and because the table is constantly read from throughout the app.p  h3Transaction with Subqueryh3  pThis is how Im currently doing it but it still causes massive performance issuesp  precodeSTART TRANSACTION INSERT INTO objects typeid,number VALUES typeid, SELECT COALESCEMAXnumber,01 FROM objects WHERE typeid  typeid FOR UPDATE COMMIT codepre  pAnother negative thing about this approach is that I need to do a follow up query in order to get the number that was added i.e. searching for an object with the typeid ordered by number desc so I can see the number that was created  this is done based on a userid so it works but adds an extra query which Id like to avoidp  h3Triggersh3  pI looked into using a trigger in order to dynamically add the number upon insert but this wasnt performant as I need to perform a query on the table Im inserting into which isnt allowed so has to be within a subquery causing performance issues.p  h3Grouped AutoIncrementh3  pIve had a look at grouped autoincrement so that the number would autoincrement based on typeid but then I lose my autoincrement ID.p  hr  pDoes anybody have any ideas on how I can make this performant at the level of concurrent inserts that I need My table is currently InnoDB on MySQL 5.5p  pAppreciate any helpp  pstrongUpdatestrong Just in case it is relevant, the objects table has several million objects in it. Some of the codetypeidcode can have around 500,000 objects assigned to them.p

Negative 1702 pIn CakePHP 3.0 named parameters have been removed thank god in favour of standard query string parameters inline with other application frameworks.p  pWhat Im still struggling to get my head around though is that in other MVC frameworks, for example ASP.NET you would pass the parameters in the ActionResult same as functionp  precodeEdit int id  null         do stuff with id   codepre  pAnd that method would be passed the id as a query string like codeEditid1code and youd use Routing to make it pretty like codeEdit1code.p  pIn CakePHP however anything passed inside the function parameters likep  precodefunction edit id  null         do stuff with id   codepre  pMust be done as a passed parameter like codeEdit1code which bypasses the query string idea and also the need for routing to improve the URL.p  pIf I name the params in the link for that edit likep  precodethisgtHtmlgtlinkEdit, arrayaction gt edit, id gt postgtid codepre  pI then have to dop  precodepublic function edit       id  thisgtrequestgtqueryid       do stuff with id   codepre  pTo get at the parameter id passed. Would of thought it would pick it up in the function like in ASP.NET for CakePHP 3.0 but it doesnt.p  pI prefer to prefix the passed values in the edit link instead of just passing them so I dont have to worry about the ordinal as much on the other end and I know what they are etc.p  pHas anyone played with either of these ways of passing data to their methods in CakePHP and can shed more light on the correct ways of doing things and how the changes in version 3.0 will improve things in this area...p
Negative 1702 pIm having a problem with repeated rather than duplicate entries in my tables.p  pFirstly, let me explain the scenario.  I have a Windows based machine on our network acting as an apache server running PHP and MYSQL.  p  pUsing various browsers but usually Chrome any of my 30 users can log in and access my PHP programroutines.p  pNow for an example.  I have a table that has certno as a unique column, and other columns such as manuf,model,serial,desc  etc A user enters the data for the other columns into a web form. When submitted my program inserts a new row into the table with certno being an increment from the previous row.p  pThe problem is that occasionally I notice duplicate entries different certno values obviously but with the data duplicated.  Time stamps show these enteries to be just a few seconds apart insufficient time for the user to enter the data again.p  pInvestigation indicates that a possible cause is that a network delay prevents the client browser from knowing that the entry was successful and it submits the data again.p  pIs this a possible cause or can someone suggest something else Any suggestions to prevent this from happening would also be appreciated. Note that Im not yet using START TRANSACTION and COMMIT.  Would this make any difference if its a network delay issuep

Negative 1702 pIm newbie in Java and I desperately need your help.p  pCurrently Im working on my project which requires me to generate PDF file from certain user inputs. My output PDF file is expected to contain images in several cells. Everything seems okay if I run the application in Netbeans IDE. I try to open the generated PDF file and its nice. No problem at all.p  pThen I do the Clean and Build thing so Ill have an application with jar extension. This where the problem is. If I generate the PDF file from this jarextensionapplication, the PDF file is corrupted. It says that  An error occured. I see the size of the file is always 0 bytes. But if I remove the codes for addingimagesincells in my source code, the PDF file is not corrupted. It can be opened, but the consequence is my file doesnt contain any image.p  pMy questions arep  ul liAm I possibly doing something wrong in the code so that the error occurs Or is it natural that I can not generated PDF file using the jarextensionapplication if that file contains any imageli liHow come the file is generated nicely if run directly in Netbeans IDE, but get the opposite after if run in jar extensionli ul  pThanks for any answer.p

Negative 1702 pIve been looking at several different solutions to my table concurrency problems in codeMySQLPHPInnoDBcodep  pI really want Process 2 to wait for Process 1 to commit before starting its own transaction and codeSELECTcodeing data to work on and then trying to INSERT a codeUNIQUE INDEXcode. So, Process 1 locks the table and Process 2 checks for the lock, and waits if a codeWRITE lockcode already exists with something like codesleepcode...  I cannot use semaphores.p  ol lipIs that it  1b. That simple  1c. Should I also still check for a duplicate entry when codeINSERTcodeingpli lipAlso, do I need to check for this single codeWRITE lockcode bEVERYWHERE ELSEb that there are codeUPDATEScode andor codeINSERTScode to the table, or will this be handled automatically by making the codeUPDATEINSERTcode wait This is only done once, so making all other queries wait is the single biggest downside if this is the case.pli ol  pSOLUTION BONUS THOUGHT it would seem simpler to check for a duplicate key error when inserting, and if true, then recodeSELECTcode and recalculate a new value and try again until the codeDUPLICATE KEYcode error is no longer.p

Negative 1702 pIm trying to get my head around why data annotation validation errors are triggering when the page first loads, prior to any SubmitPosts. But more importantly how to fix this.p  pReading SO and the interwebs, the reason seems to be model binding triggers validation errors for the view model properties, prior to the view model properties having values. Im not sure if this is true and what is actually happening, but it sounds legit.p  pAnd Ive read two workarounds, which sound a bit hacky 1. Use the ModelState.Clear in the controller action method on the inital page load, OR 2. Initialiase the view model properties in an empty view model constructor.

Negative 1702 pI am in the process of learning C11 features and as part of that I am diving head first into the world of codeuniqueptrcode and codesharedptrcode.p  pWhen I started, I wrote some code that used codeuniqueptrcode exclusively, and as such when I was passing my variables around I needed to accomplish that with codestdmovecode or so I was made to understand.p  pI realized after some effort that I really needed codesharedptrcode instead for what I was doing. A quick findreplace later and my pointers were switched over to shared but I lazily just left the codemovecode calls in.p  pTo my surprise, not only did this compile, but it behaved perfectly well in my program and I got every ounce of functionality I was expecting... particularly, I was able to move a codesharedptrcode from ObjectA to ObjectB, and both objects had access to it and could manipulate it. Fantastic.p  pThis raised the question for me though... is the codemovecode call actually doing anything at all now that I am on codesharedptrcode And if so, what, and what are the ramifications of itp  pCode Examplep  precodesharedptrltLabelgt lblLevelnew Label  levelTest is sharedptrltLabelgt declared in the interface of my class, undefined to this point levelTest  lblLevel  Configure my label with some redacted code  Pass the label off to a container which stores the sharedptr in an stdlist That stdlist is iterated through in the render phase, rendering text to screen thisgtguiView.AddSubviewmovelblLevel codepre  pAt this point, I can make important changes to levelTest like changing the text, and those changes are reflected on screen.p  pThis to me makes it appear as though both codelevelTestcode and the sharedptr in the list are the same pointer, and codemovecode really hasnt done much. This is my amateur interpretation. Looking for insight. Using MinGW on Windows. p

Negative 1702 pI am using PdfSharp for generating PDFs. I have PDF templates which I load and import specific PdfPages from it in order to construct a PDF document filled with data. The templates have all static content, and in runtime I open the Pdf templates with import option, import the PdfPage needed and stamp dynamic content on it. Both static and dynamic printing involved Embedded fonts. Once this operation is completed in the resultant PDF document I see the Embedded fonts twice, thus increasing the size of the PDF document substantially.p  pHow can I avoid this I dont have much control over deciding which fonts to embed during the dynamic content printing operation. p  pI need to be able to remove the embedded fonts once I import the PdfPage from the template. Any points are appreciated. Basically we dont need duplicate embedded fonts in there.p  pThanksp

Not secure, I know.p  precode web.js var express  requireexpress var logfmt  requirelogfmt var app  express  app.uselogfmt.requestLogger  app.get, functionreq, res    var code  req.query.code   var result  evalfunctionreq, res   code  req, res   res.sendResult   result   var port  process.env.PORT  5000 app.listenport, function    console.logListening on   port  codepre  pI want to be able to pass coffeescript into the query string and have it be evaluated, strongbutstrong I dont want to change the node.js code strongat allstrong. So I would need to wrap something around the coffeescript to turn it into javascript at eval time, doing the strongcompilation and executionstrong of the resulting javascript strongfully within the evalstrong.p  pIs this possiblep  pstrongClarificationstrong I dont want the source of the coffeescript compiler to exist on disk on my web server at all. e.g. extrascoffeescript.js I want to pass the source of the coffeescript compiler strongintostrong the eval block, so the compilation itself is done without any dependencies. Then I want to execute the resulting javascript. p  pThe coffeescript compiler probably wont fit into a query param, so conceptually it could be passed via POST body or otherwise.p

Negative 1702 pI have a M24SRDiscovery board, STM32f103RG MCU, and Im using Keil as IDE for programming.

Im pretty much out of ideas and any other suggestion would be nice.p  pI have a 64 bit Windows 7 OS.p  pThanks for your time. p

It keeps the state of the fragment of each tab and also can refresh just one fragment and they also update actionbar title.p

MVC sends the following headerp  precodeCacheControl maxage0 codepre  pChrome gets the message and doesnt request the image on subsequent requests the server responds with a 304 not modified response.p  pBut when I requrest the image in IE, MVC sends down a nocache header for some reasonp  precodePragma nocache codepre  pNot surprisingly, IE requests the image on every subsequent page load. Of course, its cached in RAM on the server so there is no overhead to create the image, but it does consume bandwidth to send it down the wire. p  pIs there any reason why this behavior would be default in MVC I assume that MS would want it to perform better in IE, not worse. p

As I understand Redis 2.4 has a fixed limited amount connected clients.p  pThats why weve separated the Session and Data Cache in a separate instance of Redis. Unfortunately AngiesList doesnt support more than one connection, so that is connected only to the master server. The BookSleeve client connections are ramdomized using the System.Random from .Net.p  precodereadonly Random randomReadConnection  new RandomintDateTime.Now.Ticks codepre  pThe number of client connections for the data cache is around 200 on all servers. The session cache had about 4100 connections at its peak.p  pWe have have looked closely at the Redis logs, monitor and run iftop and top, but cant find anything usefull.p  pSo.... why are these dips occuringp  pI am a .Net developer and no linux specialist. We dont have any specialists in the Redislinux field... so were hoping somebody out here can help us narrow down the search.p  pAs part of a backup plan we are now updating our client to ServiceStack Redis v3 with a compatible session state package and configuring a server with Redis 2.8 just to be sure.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1702 pIm new to AngularJS and Im trying to make a home page that loads dynamic content from my database to create links. When I click one of those links on the home page, it sends a request to my node server and retrieves the appropriate data from the database and displays that on the partial view. When Im on that partial view and I click the browsers back button to go back to the home page, the dynamic content that was originally loaded doesnt display. Below is my code.

I have done various tests to show and prove to myself that the codethiscode inside the addEventHandler changes when it becomes bound to the window. This much I assumed before testing but I was able to see that once window.resize event happens the listen method is gone and not a part of the global window variable....p  pI have also tried adding a codethiscode capture such as codethis.me  thiscode inside the object constructor however it also couldnt see the codemecode variable once it ran. Once the window took the function over it no longer knew anything about the codemecode variable or any reference to my class methods....p  pI am aware that I could separate this differently but my goal here is to learn how to fully encapsulate and use as many clean OOP structures as possible as I just came from the .NET world and I need it in my life.p  pI am also aware that I could make messy calls and or store this object or access to the methods inside the window variable but that seems outright wrong to me. I should be able to fully encapsulate this object and have its events and methods all implemented in this class structure.p  pI also know that the currImg variable is not going to be seen either but lets start small here. I assume once I figure out my incorrect train of thought on scope for JavaScript I should be fine to figure out the currImg problem.p  pI know theres 1000 JavaScript programmers out there waiting to rip me a new one over asking this simple question but I gotta know...p  pThoughts anyonep

Negative 1702 pIm currently working on an application which displays many images one after another. I dont have the luxury of using video for this unfortunately, however, I can choose the image codec in use. The data is sent from a server to the application, already encoded. p  pIf I use PNG or JPEG for example I can convert the data I receive into a UIImage using code[[UIImage alloc] initWithDatasomedata]code. When I use a raw byte array, or another custom codec which has to decode to a raw byte array first, I have to create a bitmap context, then use codeCGBitmapContextCreateImagebitmapContextcode which gives a CGImageRef, which then is fed into code[[UIImage alloc] initWithImagecgimage]code. This is much slower. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxpJAm.png altImage Conversion Timesp  pThe above chart time is measured in seconds is the time it takes to perform the conversion from NSData to UIImage. PNG, JPEG, BMP, and GIF are all approximately the same. Null is simply not bothering with the conversion and returning nil instead. Raw is a raw RGBA byte array which is converted using the bitmap context method. The custom one decompresses into a Raw format and then does the same thing. LZ4 is the raw data, compressed using the LZ4 algorithm and so it also runs through the bitmap context method. p  pPNG images for example, are simply bitmapped images which are compressed. This decompression and then render takes less time than my render for Raw images. iOS must be doing something behind the scenes to make this faster. p  pIf we look at the chart of how long it takes to convert each type as well as how long it takes to draw to a graphics context we get the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzCbpe.png altDrawing and conversion timesp  pWe can see that most images take very different times to convert, but are fairly similar in drawing times. This rules out any performance boost of UIImage being lazy and converting only when needed. p  pMy question is essentially is the faster speeds for well known codecs something I can exploit Or, if not, is there another way I can render my Raw data faster p  pEdit For the record, I am drawing these images on top of another UIImage whenever I get a new one. It may be that there is an alternative which is faster which I am willing to look into. However, OpenGL is not an option unfortunately. p  pFurther edit This question is fairly important and I would like the best possible answer. The bounty will not be awarded until the time expires to ensure the best possible answers are given. p  pFinal edit My question was why isnt decompressing and drawing a raw RGBA array faster than drawing a PNG for example since PNG has to decompress to a RGBA array and then draw. The results are that it emisem in fact faster. However, this only appears to be the case in release builds. Debug builds are not optimised for this, but the UIImage code which runs behind the scenes clearly is. By compiling as a release build RGBA array images were much faster than other codecs. p

Negative 1702 pThe internet seems to be fairly void of information or documentation about the Enyim Increment method. I cant quite figure out what it is doing.

Operation happens atomically on the server.p blockquote  pThis sounds all well and good if I could get it to work.p  pThough nobody has many clear answers, the consensus seems to be that the method is supposed to set the value to the given default value, should the key not exist in memcached. However, I cant for the life of me get a key to store to a default value.p  pI dont want to use a store  increment combo because it needs to be used across a multiserver architecture and I could not guarantee the operation would be atomic.p  pAny ideas or pointers on how to successfully increment the value of a memcached key A super bonus would be to also have the default value have a time to live as well.p  pEdit I have tried this in both the Text and Binary protocols and cant seem to get it to set a default value in either setting. p  pThanks in advance for the helpp

Negative 1702 pI was recently trying to solve a problem that took n sorted integers as input and we had to delete k integers from the array to maximize the minimum difference between two consecutive terms.p  pExample test case ARRAY 6,7,10,13,15 delete 2 integers.p  pANSWER Integers deleted 7,13p  pMy approachp  pSince we have to delete k integers we iterate over the array k times. In each iteration we wind the minimum difference between two consecutive terms. Lets say that after one iteration the pair i and i1 have minimum difference.Then we compare the difference between i1 and i1 and the difference between i and i2. If the first is larger then we delete the term i else we delete i1.p  pThis approach is giving me a wrong answer.p  pSince the constraints on n and k are low  1ltkltnlt30 . I believe that the problem can be solved using dynamic programming but I do not know how to approach it.p  pAny help would be nice. I do not want the code just the algorithm and how it was derived.

Negative 1702 pI have a query that in SQL Server Management Studio would look something like thisp  precodeSELECT      distinctr2.code AS code     FROM  SELECT      vMatrix.type AS type,      vMatrix.code AS code,      vMatrix.id AS id     FROM vMatrix AS vMatrix AS Extent1     INNER JOIN DEScratch AS Extent2 ON Extent1.code  Extent2.Code AND Extent1.type  Extent2.Type     INNER JOIN vMatrix as r2 ON Extent1.id  r2.id     WHERE Extent2.HeaderID  94 and r2.type  4 codepre  pBasically I have a table called codevMatrixcode and I first join it with another table called codeDEScratchcode to select all the records from codevMatrixcode that match codeCodecode and codeTypecode with codeDEScratchcode. So far, so good. Then I need to join that result with codevMatrixcode again, this time matching up the codeidcode fields to select all the records in codevMatrixcode that match the codeidcodes from the last join and then I just filter it by codetypecode.p  pIve been trying desperately to make this work in a LINQ statement, but it keeps losing the second join and basically returning me only the result from the first join if I remove the codetypecode filter  else it returns nothing. For examplep  precodevar stuff  from r1 in ctx.vMatrices                join sr in ctx.DEScratch.Wheret gt t.HeaderID  header.ID                on new  c  r1.code, t  r1.type  equals new  c  sr.Code, t  sr.Type                 join r2 in ctx.vMatrices                on r1.id equals r2.id into tmp                from t in tmp where t.regiontype  filterType                select t.code.Distinct.ToList codepre  pAnd variations of this with and without the codeintocode clause, with the order of joins rearranged, etc all consistently give me an actual query with just the one join. It seems it wont do the selfjoin on the table for some unknown reason.p  pWhat am I missing here p  pMy guess is that its looking at the codeid  idcode part and deciding that it can optimize that join away, but it cant. The SQL generated is basically the same as my SQL statement minus the second join. There is no second codeinner joincode and no clause matching codeid  idcode. How can I force it to not ignore that joinp  pFor example thisp  precodevar stuff  from r2 in ctx.vMatrices            join r1 in from t in ctx.vMatrices                        join sr in ctx.DEScratch.Wheret gt t.HeaderID  header.ID                        on new  c  t.code, t  t.type  equals new  c  Code, t  Type                         select t.id            on r2.id equals r1             select r2.ToList codepre  pGenerates thisp  precodeSELECT      [Extent1].[type] AS [type],      [Extent1].[code] AS [code],      [Extent1].[id] AS [id]     FROM  SELECT      [vRegionMatrix].[type] AS [type],      [vRegionMatrix].[code] AS [code],      [vRegionMatrix].[id] AS [id]     FROM [dbo].[vMatrix] AS [vMatrix] AS [Extent1]     INNER JOIN [dbo].[DEScratch] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[type]  [Extent2].[Type] AND [Extent1].[code]  [Extent2].[Code]     WHERE [Extent2].[HeaderID]  plinq0 AND plinq0 IS NOT NULL codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong This is about as far as I have gotp  precodevar regions  from r1 in                    from t in ctx.vMatrices                     join sr in ctx.DEScratch.Wheret gt t.HeaderID  header.ID                     on new  c  t.code, t  t.type.Value  equals new  c  sr.Code, t  sr.Type                      select t.id                join r2 in ctx.vMatrices.GroupByc gt c.id                on r1 equals r2.Key                    select intr2.DefaultIfEmpty.Wherel gt l.type  filterType.FirstOrDefault.code.Distinct.ToList codepre  pThis emalmostem works. The problem is that in some case the grouping will have more than one entry so by using codeFirstOrDefaultcode I lose some of the results. What I need is equivalent to a codeSelectManycode to flatten the results of the group, but when I tried removing that last line and replacing it with another codefrom...incodep  precodefrom f in r2.DefaultIfEmpty where f.type  filterType select f.code.Distinct.ToList codepre  pI suddenly lose that last join again and end up with nothing.p

Negative 1702 pI am doing some image processing, for which I benefit from vectorization.

One tag with longer ttls and others with codettl0scode ESI content with login box.p  pAnyway, I want varnish to hit the main request, but ask backend ESI content for some info like headers. When ESI content comes back cause I understand first is parent request, then are sub request with ESI, I want to have some kind of communication.p  blockquote   pRemember that changes made to beresp are stored in obj afterwards. And   the resp. variables are copies of whats about to be returned    possibly of obj. A change to beresp will, in other words, affect   future obj. and resp. variables. Similar semantics apply to req.   and bereq.em. bereq.em is the backend request as created from the   original request. It may differ slightly  Varnish can convert HEAD   requests to GET for example.p blockquote  pfrom a hrefhttpswww.varnishsoftware.comstaticbookVCLfunctions.html relnofollowhttpswww.varnishsoftware.comstaticbookVCLfunctions.htmlap  pFor example If ESI subrequest has header codeXESICookiecode on response, I want to pass it to main response.p  pThe only way I can find out anything about the ESI is codereg.esilevelcode.p  precodeif req.esilevel gt 0       set req.http.  codepre  pBasically what I want to achieve is thatp  pI want varnish to cache my whole page, but for session management pipe the ESI content, but to preserve session I need pass some headers from sub ESI to parent response but I believe thats obvious.p  pI believe the varnish requests parent and ESIs are taken care separately, which means I wont have any chance to communicate. Varnish simply replace  tag with html from ESI response. Is it sop  pIm starting to believe that theres no solution for that, but maybe someone has better solution for this problem How to preserve session I found some solutions, but no one fits my needs. I believed with FakeSession, whre ID was generated by Varnish with some C code, but with no lock.p  pI want to do this in that way because it would be much easier for me to adopt current symfony2 app. Anyway I cant believe that symfony2 didnt expect this kind of feature. My pages are mainly static besides few widgets ESI content.p  pIt would be very nice though to have ESI content request, content and response to object variablep  precodeobj. codepre  pI cannot believe the varnish object does not have any information about ESI content.p  pIt is important to notice that I am looking for solution in .vcl configuration, but any solution will work for me.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 1702 pI need your help on below.p  pI have JSF2.0 application which runs on WAS8.5. I want to separate the static and dynamic contents as we want to use WAS server only for dynamic contents and IHS to server static contents for my application. My current architecture and design as follows p  ol liMarked file serving flag as false in ibmwebext.xml file IBM config file to say whether WAS to be served static content or Not.li liWeve used core JSF2.0 tages houtputStylesheet, houtputScript and hgraphicImage and also traditional html tags some places link, script and img to load static contents. li ol  pMy understandingObservation is,  1.  When we load static contents using JSF2.0 components styles using houtputStylesheet component, java scripts using houtputScript and images using hgraphicImage, all static contents will be served by WAS server as FacesServlet is responsible for reading the component and loading the resources accordingly. According to the JSF2.0 guidelinesampstandard, we should use JSF tags to load the resources like js, css and images. 2.  When we load static contents using html tags, all the static contents served by webserver ie IHSp  pNow my question is, My application is internet channel application where we want to serve the possible as quickly as possible. Technically, I want to use Core JSF tags wherever possible and use the WAS server to serve only dynamic contents to reduce the load.  p  pPlease advice me options to meet my requirement.p  pThanks, Nanjundan Chinnasamyp

Negative 1702 pThis chunk of code is part of a larger project. I tell you this because it is relevant. Im working on a small codewise database to keep track of all my photos. Im designing it so that I can later extend the program to store the citations in all my papers.p  pFor better or for worse, Ive settled on a simple flat file system with fixed width fields. That may not be the most efficient use of memory, and the files sizes get fluffed up, but it has some super advantages No delimiters so the files easily remain human readable with nice formatting, and easy array access using simple array indexing.p  pI like the last part particularly because it lays within my skills. One thing about this database is that I need to be able to make a lot of entries FAAAAST The bottleneck emerges in the user input part, not memory, and not disk space, so Im concentrating on making the input wicked fast and easy.p  pIve learned that getting user input in C can be a tricky thing. Cs string handling library has a lot of functions that can be exploited to generate buffer overflow. So For this code, I implemented some advice from Robert C. Seacords emSecure Coding in C and Cem Specifically the chapter, Strings and Buffer Overflows.p  pHeres a link a hrefhttpwww.informit.comarticlesarticle.aspxp2036582ampseqNum5 relnofollowhttpwww.informit.comarticlesarticle.aspxp2036582ampseqNum5ap  pSeacord suggests that using fgets to process input lines, while possible to do securely, has performance limitations. I like fast. Dont you He further suggests using getchar instead. Thats what I did.p  pHeres his suggestion for the use of a while loop for using getchar securelyp  precodewhile ch  getchar  n ampamp ch  EOF codepre  pIn my code below, I tweak that a touch.p  pThere are several things I need the IO to do. First, if the input entered is too long, I WANT it to truncate. Even though Im maybe the only user, I might make a mistake. Second, if the input is shorter than the field widthwhich is emmainlyem the caseI want to pad that field with spaces to the right.p  pThats the problem Im having. More on that in a bit.p  pThis whitespace keeps the flatfile clean looking, and, again, makes indexing extremely easy. I need to just hit the Enter key and move on to the next entry, sequentially, knowing the computer has formatted the data just the way I want it.p  pThis is actually a crude implementation E.F. Codds principle that the data must be shielded from direct access. Everything must be checked, polished, parsed, etc., before it gets into storage. This prevents data corruption.p  pIn this code, Ive cut all that last out because its just noise, and I get pretty sick of trying to read other peoples code who post their whole damn program with all sorts of extraneous stuff instead of just the part thats giving them trouble. At the same time, I like to post a emcompleteem program that can just be selected, copied, pasted, saved, and compiled. So Ive done that here. Ive left in the comments and my little checks which Ill uncomment to make sure everything is as it should be, then comment out again, so this is not the simplest possible code, but whats that famous Einstein quote about emtooem simplep  pAnyhow, I know all that is a bit long, but I wanted to sketch out the design principles I was using. You might have a useful critique. I sure as hell could be taking a dumb approach.p  pThe exact problem I have is just how to pad those fields with exactly the right amount of whitespace.p  pI emdidem figure out a solution. Sort of.p  pBut it seems like a hack to me.p  pI just suspect there is a more efficient, fast, or elegant way to accomplish what Im trying to do. The hack part is calling a second print function and using the difference between the character count and the maxlength constant to add whitespace after the data. See lines 2739 for that. It works Butp  pShouldnt I just be able to pad the array directlyp  pCant figure it outp  pHeres the codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt   arrayops5.c     Template for inputting data from stdin using getchar.

Negative 1702 pI use codeMKNetworkKitcode to implement web service client in my application. p  pAt first, I use a singleton to implement network service client. The main code like this.p  pIn file codeWXYNetworkEngine.hcodep  precodeinterface WXYNetworkEngine  MKNetworkEngine   WXYNetworkEngineshareNetworkEngine  singleton method   MKNetworkOperationuserLoginCallBackFunccallback  MKNetworkOperationuserRegisterCallBackFunccallback  MKNetworkOperationgetNewsListCallBackFunccallback  MKNetworkOperationgetCommentListCallBackFunccallback other network service api method end codepre  pWith the growing of my app, the codeWXYNetworkEnginecode class become messy. So, I want to break the class into serval files base on service logic using category. p  pFor example, I want to move the account related method into a new file named codeWXYNetworkEngineAccountService.hcode, and the main code in that file like this.p  precodeimport WXYNetworkEngine.h interface WXYNetworkEngineAccountService  MKNetworkOperationuserLoginCallBackFunccallback  MKNetworkOperationuserRegisterCallBackFunccallback other account related network service api method end codepre  pAnd after move out service, the expected file codeWXYNetworkEngine.hcode like this.p  precodeimport WXYNetworkEngineAccountService.h import WXYNetworkEngineNewsService.h import WXYNetworkEngineCommentService.h import any other service interface WXYNetworkEngine  MKNetworkEngine   WXYNetworkEngineshareNetworkEngine  singleton method  other basic network client method end codepre  pHowever, it is obviously that this will cause cycle reference between codeWXYNetworkEnginecode and other service category and result in compile error.p  pI have tried to use forward declaration to declare codeWXYNetworkEnginecode in service category, but it can not work. And the only way I can think to solve this problem is to create a new file such as codeWXYNetworkKit.hcode to import all the related network service method, likes this.p  precodeimport WXYNetworkEngine.h import WXYNetworkEngineAccountService.h import WXYNetworkEngineNewsService.h import WXYNetworkEngineCommentService.h import any other service codepre  pAnd all the other file import the new codeWXYNetworkKit.hcode.p  pBut I want to know are there any way to solve this problem. Such as some way to forward declaration for service category in WXYNetworkEngine.h  Or use some way other than category to break down the Servicep

If I edit that file with an external application notepad, say then how do I get the changes to propagate through to my design implementation Even doubleclicking the xco and clicking the Generate button doesnt seem to work, the only way Ive been able to do it so far is to delete the core and rebuild it again from scratch.p

Negative 1702 pI am using the DACircularProgressView to display a large round progress view. For me at the moment it was the best one I could find but if you have a better suggestion I am up for your options. Anyway while this project is working great there is one custom change that I would like to make to the control that is a bit too confusing for me. As you can see below my width is 18.5. Since the view will just go around in a circle the progress color and the track color have a straight line separating the two colors. My question is how can I make this rounded like in the normal progress control from Apple. Meaning how can I make the it so it looks like the progress color is SnowPlowing through the track color meaning it is a half circle at the end of the progress Thank youp  pstrongNOTEstrong How can I

Negative 1702 pI have a situation where a server may arbitrarily break up transmitted UTF8 string data, including in the middle of a UTF8 sequence.  In the websocket proxy that is receiving this data before it goes to the client, I want to detect that case and have the proxy wait for the next packet from the server and concatenate it with the prior one before sending to the client.p  pAssuming I am seeing the data from the server as a simple array of bytes, what is the simplest logic I can use to reliably detect the case where those bytes end in the middle of a UTF8 sequencep

Negative 1702 pI wrote a Java program that uses the Data Extract API to create a TDE from a CSV file. When I ran my code the very first time against the csv file, I was able to pull 300K rows out and export a tde file to my computer. Since then it has never worked again. I had made some changes to my code after it worked successfully, but when I found that it no longer worked I reverted back to the original working code using CtrlZ. Still no luck. I put back my changes and have not been able to get a tde to output. I have been able to return a partial result back, of the first 1000 rows, as a tde, so I know my code changes work and the tde API is working. Where the problem lies is when I try to run the code on the full result 300K, it always gives me an error when trying to add a row to the table but only once, on a row that is a multiple or 1001 2002, 3003, 6006, 9009. The error is data engine error error code 204.

Negative 1702 pIm using SSIS SQL Maintenance Tasks rather than the built in SQL Server Maintenance Tasks within SQL Server Studio because I find SSIS more flexible. I noticed that the Maintenance Cleanup Task uses xpdeletefile under the covers and that xpdeletefile only deletes actual SQL Server file objects like backups and transaction logs or maintenance log files. It does so be reading the file header before deletingno match equals no delete.p  pWhat the Maintenance Cleanup Taskxpdeletefile does not purge are the SSIS SQL maintenance logs Ive created.  The xpdeletefile procedure apparently  does not have a file header that it recognizes. To purge these SSIS logs that Ive created Im using a DOS command called FORFILES to purge my SSIS SQL maintenance logsthis does actually work.p  pstrongMy question is this. Is there a way to generate the SQL Maintenance logs generated within SSIS like they are generated by SQL Server Studio so xpdeletefile will recognize those logs and delete themstrong p  pId rather have SSIS use the Maintenance Cleanup Task if possibleIm just curious if anyone has discovered this.  I already know how to do SSIS logging to log my packages. Microsoft doesnt seem to have an answer for this one on Connect, KB articles, etc, but I know that SQL Server Studio does use the SSIS engine under the coversso Id think their would be a way to duplicate that functionality in some way. All in all this feels more like a bug to me to have an SSIS Maintenance Cleanup Task not be able to clean up the maintenance files you just generated with another SSIS SQL Maintenance Taskbut it appears that Microsoft sees this more as a feature. p  pp.s. Im not overly enthusiastic about SSIS. Ive already designed TSQL maintenance plans that work very well and are easy to deploy. However, our company wants to try Microsofts Maintenance methodology on our VM servers in case the DBAs wont manage those boxesitd be easier, in theory, for nonDBAs to figure out.p
Negative 1702 pGit doesnt really work well for large binary files. And its better to use gitannex, gitlfs etc for them. I want to ensure I am reminded about this fact any time I try to addcommit a large binary file. I know that GitHub already warns if a file is larger than their limit. However, I want the solution to not rely on GitHub.p  pSo, my question is  Is it possible to specify preferably in gitconfig, although even specifying it per repository is okay that I want to be warned any time I addcommit a file larger than a predefined sizep

Negative 1702 pIm trying to extract images from a PDF which is read protected. p  pWith normal PDFs the a hrefhttppoppler.freedesktop.org relnofollowPoppler librarya extracts images fine, and from readprotected PDFs it can also extract the text just fine. The images are a different story though. It either doesnt extract all images, or extracts all of them in vague grey or black colors.p  pOn the following PDF a hrefhttpwww12.zippyshare.comvDgtCWgrdfile.html relnofolloworiginal PDF herea which has as you can see in the thumbnail below a lot of imagesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commpxkd.jpg altenter image description herep  pI tried the codepdfimagescode command from the a hrefhttppoppler.freedesktop.org relnofollowPoppler libraryap  precode pdfimages j ticket.pdf i codepre  pand the codepdftohtmlcode command from a hrefhttpmupdf.com relnofollowmupdfap  precode pdftohtml nodrm ticket.pdf codepre  pBut both libs only extract one of the many images. That image is extracted correctly though. From other PDFs I get all images, but all of them are grey or black. p  pSince readprotection is supposedly only a flag in the PDF document, and not an actual scrambling or encryption of the source in the end your computer can show the images without putting in a password it should be possible somehow to extract the images individually. I can even create a thumbnail from the whole PDF using a hrefhttpimagemagick.org relnofollowImageMagicka codeconvert ticket.pdf ticket.jpgcode, so why not individual imagesp  pDoes anybody know how I can extract all images from readprotected PDFs All tips are welcomep

Negative 1702 pConsider there are N files to be completely written to disk i.e. flushed from all file buffers. For each file we write a small relative to HDD seek time amount of data, e.g. 64KB, with codeWriteFilecode, and then call codeFlushFileBufferscode on that file to ensure that the data for the file is completely flushed to hard drive.p  pIf we writeampflush files onebyone sequentially, then I expect that approximately it takes time codeNseekTimecode  codeNwriteTimecode, where codeseekTimecode is the time to position hard drive head to the proper sector which may take up to the time of full disk rotation, and codewriteTimecode is the time it takes the disk to write sequentially 64KB of data. With such onebyone approach we give the OS no room for optimization because we define the sequence in which the files must be flushed.p  pWith some support from the OS a performance improvement could be achieved by rearranging the order of file writeampflushes so that taking into account the disk rotation i.e. the current position of the head on disk file operations are rearranged so to start from those for which almost no rotation is needed i.e. the nearest to the current position of disk head and ending with those for whom almost full rotation of the disk is needed.p  pThe question is does operating system Windows in particular provide such optimization In the other words, can performance be improved by running file writeampflush operations in parallel in N threads, one thread per file Or will it cause extra repositioning operations decreasing the performance as a kind of contextswitches for hard drivep

Negative 1702 pI think Ive implemented everything asked within these set of instructions p  pDesign and implement a set of three classes that define shapes RoundShape, Sphere, Cone. For each class, store fundamental data about its size and provide methods to access and modify this data. In addition, provide appropriate methods to compute the area, and volume, for Sphere and Cone. In your design, consider how shapes are related and thus where inheritance can be implemented. Dont create duplicate instance variables. Create a main method which instantiates 2 Sphere objects any parameters, 2 Cone objects any parameters, display them with ToString, change one parameter your choice in each, and display them again.p  pHere is my code p  precodeclass RoundShape     double shape  9     double radius  4     int cone1  3     int sphere1      public String toString         return   the man  cone1  this also  sphere1           class Sphere that extends RoundShape  class Sphere extends RoundShape     double getArea         double area  4  Math.PI  Math.powradius, 2         return area       end of getArea      double getVolume         double volume  43  Math.PI  Math.powradius, 3         return volume         end of getVolume   end of the class Sphere    class Cone that extends RoundShape  class Cone extends RoundShape     double height  8     double getArea         double area  Math.PI  radius  radius  Math.sqrtMath.powheight, 2  Math.powradius, 2         return area       end of getArea for Cone      double getVolume         double volume  Math.PI  Math.powradius, 2  height3         return volume       end of getVolume for Cone   end of the class Cone    public class MurrayA03A4      public static void mainString[] args           Sphere sphere1  new Sphere             sphere1.getArea             sphere1.getVolume         System.out.printlnsphere1          Cone cone1  new Cone             cone1.getArea             cone1.getVolume         System.out.printlncone1        End of class header    End of method header codepre  pMy main question is, how do I refer back to the toString method from content thats in the main method Additionally, is the toString found within the correct class or should I place it in a new class or should I create a toString for every classp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 1702 pI am a beginner with DDD and I try to model elegantly in C the next scenariop  ol lipA template that basically has only a name property on it and a list of items that have to be executed in a specific order.  code public class Template      public string Name  get set      public List Items  get set  p  ppublic class Item      public string Name  get set      public int Order  get set   codepli liA type called Profile. code public class Profile      public string Name  get set   codeli ol  pThe profile class is intended to say p  ul liI am using template A to know what items I have and in what orderli liIf template A changes, then I am using the new version because I dont want to keep a clone of the list template A had. li liIf I am deleted then the template is not affected in any wayli liIf I am created then I require a templateli liI can be looked after by my name onlyli ul  pThis looks like the aggregate root would be the template, which would have a list of Items and a list of Profiles. But I feel that searching by the name of the profile is requiring me to search all the templates that have a profile with the given name.

Also, the profile is the one that uses the template and having the template know about profiles that use it, seems wrong. p  pHow do you model this What should be the aggregate root here Is more than one How do you perform the search if you want to use it from UIp

Negative 1702 pLets say you have two arrays, codesrccode and codedestcode. codedestcode is bigger. You want to copy over all the elements from codesrccode to the beginning of codedestcode and overwrite anything that may already be there. To do this, we can do an codeArray.Copysrc, dest, src.Lengthcode, which is both more concise and more efficient than a for loop.p  pNow, say codedestcode becomes a codeListltTgtcode. Whats the most efficient way to copy all of the elements from codesrccode I know List is internally implemented using an array, so if we could get our hands on that barring reflection, of course we could just do an codeArray.Copycode and this would be a nonissue.p  pIm not looking for a forloop because of said reasons, but if thats the only way to do it I guess thatll have to do.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong I was hoping not to have to type up a code sample on my phone, but it seems from the barrage of incorrect answers Im going to have top  precodeint[] src   1, 2, 3  var dest  new Listltintgt  4, 5, 6, 7   for int i  0 i lt src.Length i      dest[i]  src[i]  codepre  pWhat Im looking for would be the logical equivalent of the above, but have the performance of Array.Copy.p

Then when he submits form, the controller should update the model in db. p  pThe problem is flow, because not all of the fields are in  tags, so they wont pass after submiting the form..

Negative 1702 pI have already defined listBox with all the functionality It is a Graph with a dragging points. Around ListBox I want to add GridLines on X and Y axis I hope thats the right word  data info on X axis and data info on Y axis  a hrefhttpi50.tinypic.com5fiyxh.jpg relnofollowexamplea  hour times every half hour or so on X and 0100 on Y axis.p  pSo on X axis I like to have hour from 000 to 2400 and on Y axis  from 0  100. I can use normal label or textblock and write number in is the simplest idea. But because grid of listbox will change depending on the data, I like to have manageable scaling. Start is always eg. 0 and end is also always eg. 100. I like to scale infos that show infos every 20 units 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 or every 25 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 or so.p  pI think do it with a Borders for little marking line and in next row with TextBlock define value. All this wrap in DataTemplate.p  pIf something unclear or have any questions please ask.p
