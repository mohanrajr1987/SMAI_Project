Warren Weckesser and Salvador Dali  BHAT IRSHADs methods which are based on codenp.nonzerocode and codenp.wherecode all seem to scale linearly with the number of labels, whereas iterating through each image element with codenditercode obviously scales linearly with the size of labeled image.p  pThe results of a small testp  precodesize 1000 x 1000, numlabels 10 weckesser ... 0.214357852936s  dali ... 0.650229930878s  nditer ... 6.53645992279s    size 1000 x 1000, numlabels 100 weckesser ... 0.936990022659s  dali ... 1.33582305908s  nditer ... 6.81486487389s    size 1000 x 1000, numlabels 1000 weckesser ... 8.43906402588s  dali ... 9.81333303452s  nditer ... 7.47897100449s    size 1000 x 1000, numlabels 10000 weckesser ... 100.405524015s  dali ... 118.17239809s  nditer ... 9.14583897591s codepre  pSo the question becomes more specificp  pFor labeled images in which the number of labels is on the order of codesqrtsizeimagecode is there an algorithm to gather label coordinates that is faster than iterating through every image element i.e. with codenditercodep

Positive 20400 pI was inspired by this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma285066193904031answera by James to see how codegriddatacode and codemapcoordinatescode might be used. In the examples below Im showing 2D data, but my interest is in 3D. I noticed that codegriddatacode only provides splines for 1D and 2D, and is limited to linear interpolation for 3D and higher probably for very good reasons. However, mapcoordinates seems to be fine with 3D using higher order smoother than piecewise linear interpolation.p  pstrongMy primary questionstrong  if I have random, unstructured data where I can not use mapcoordinates in 3D, is there some way to get smoother than piecewise linear interpolation within the NumPy SciPy universe, or at least nearby p  pMy secondary question is spline for 3D not available in codegriddatacode because it is difficult or tedious to implement, or is there a fundamental difficultyp  pThe images and horrible python below show my current understanding of how griddata and mapcoordinates can or cant be used.

Positive 20400 pI have a basic question about which optimization function I should use. I havep  ol lipA model of my system implemented as a python function.

Is there any way to do this task efficientlyemp  pIm implementing DAgger algorithm and in the first iteration it is trying to add about 7M new training instances. I want to add these new instances in random positions. I tried vstack given my data was in csr format I was expecting it not to be too inefficient at least. However after 24hours its not done yet. p  pI tried converting my data to numpy.matrix format just after loading them in svmlight format. A sampling showed it can help me speed things up but interestingly the results I get from training on the converted dataset and the original dataset seem not to match with each other. It appears sklearn does not work with numpy matrix in the way I thought. I couldnt find anything in the sklearn documentation.p  pemAnother approach I thought was to define a larger dataset from the beginning so that it will reserve enough space in memory, but when Im using sklearn train or test features Ill index my dataset to the last true record. In this way, I presume, vstack will not require opening up a new large space in memory which can make the whole operation take longer. Any thoughts on thisemp

Negative 20400 pI have been attempting to handle the KeyDown event of a UserControl page in my Silverlight application, but there seems to be some strange behaviour on the part of Silverlight user input functionality. The event is not getting raised under any circumstance. I have even tried attaching the event handler to each container control within the UserControl, but still with no luck.

Negative 20400 pIm developing sales promotion system and I just stepped on something that could be probably handled with state machine pattern, but I have no experiences with state machines yet. Maybe the state machine is totally useless in this situation  So I have a sales promotion which has some duration, some assigned customers, products, discounts etc. Each promotion also has its state. Theres about 5 states. The transitions between states are strictly defined  its not possible to change state 1 to state 3 directly  user has to change state to 2 first. Therere some limitations like its not possible to add more products when promotion is in state 35. Or limitations like only superusers can edit promotion costs when its in state 35.p  pI just read about a hrefhttpwww.codeplex.comSimpleStateMachine relnofollowhttpwww.codeplex.comSimpleStateMachinea , but Im not sure if it isnt too complex for this case. I could handle the state logic in my service layer using things likep  precodeif promotion.state  statesRepository.GetState3 ampamp false  loggedUser.IsInRolesuperUser    throw new PromotionStateExceptionuser not allowed to edit promotion in this status  ... codepre  porp  precodepublic void ChangePromotionStatuspromotion, newStatus   if promotion.Status  status1 ampamp newStatus  statesRepo.GetState2     throw new StateTransitionExceptionunable to change from status 1 to   newStatus     codepre  pBut I dont like this kind of code  there must be some better approach  Does anybody have an advice I could separate the concerns of course and develop services like PromotionStatusChangeReviewService, PromotionEditPermissionService etc to make the code less coupled, but theres probably some better solution I cant see at the moment.p

Negative 20400 pThis is vaguely related top  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions329160shouldidesigntheapplicationormodeldatabasefirstShould I design the application or model database first ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions429905designfromthedatabasefirstthroughtouiortotherwayroundDesign from the database first through to UI or tother way roundap  pBut my question is more about modeling and artifacts and less about the right way to do design.  Im trying to figure out what sort of design artifact would best enunciate the link between features use cases, screens and database elements tables and columns, most particularly.  UML is very codecentric.  Database models are very database centric.  And of screen designs are UI centricp  pHeres the deal... my team is working on the first release of the product.  We used use cases, then did screen designs and database design was somewhat isolated from the two.  A critical area for bugs was the lack of traceability between the use cases and their accompanying screens and the database.  In our product, theres a very high degree of overlap between use cases and database elements.  Many use cases touch over 75 of the database infrastructure.  So we have high contention over database design areas, and its easy for a small database change to disrupt the lower levels of business logic.p  pFor our next release, I want the developers and our DBA to have a really clear insight into what parts of the database each feature touches.  The use casescreen design approach worked well, so were keeping it... the trick is linking each use case and screens to the database model so the relationships are really obvious and hard to forget about.p  pOn smaller projects were only 10 people, but often Ive worked on teams of 3 or less, Ive created my own custom diagrams to show this part of the design.  Sort of a fusion of screen, UML and database table, done in Visio with no link to actual code or SQL.  Im not sure it will work for a larger team, as its highly manual to keep up to date, and it doesnt auto generate code the way our database modeling tool does.  p  pAny recommendations  Is there a commonly accepted mechanism for thisp  pFYI  were pretty waterfall, that isnt going to change any time soon.  And we do love artifacts...  Saying switch to agile is not a viable solution for our group. p

Suppose I run the creategraph function, and the G object is returned and stored in another object lets call it X. I want to start off at a node called Bob. Bob is connected to Alice and Joe. Now, I want to reassign Y to point to either Alice or Bob at random with the data Im dealing with, a given node could have hundreds of edges leaving it.

Negative 20400 pprobably a silly question, but Im not sure how to handle this correct.p  pI got a normal form with some fields. I can insert data without problems. When I want to edit a record, Im using the modeltodictfunction to populate the form.

But when I insert a new record, it gets inserted fine, but mymodel.id  0 which means I cant save the relations for the MultipleChoiceFields.p  pSo I would like to know if this is a good way to handle this And why is mymodel.id  0 after saving the modelp

Negative 20400 pIve been looking for some information regarding the scrapped ECMAScript 4th Edition without much success, even on SO.  I know Mozillas JavaScript 1.7 implemented many all of the new features offered in 4th Edition and I thought I remembered a good John Resig post on it but I cant seem to find it on his blog now.p  pIn particularly, I want to know why it was completely scrapped in favour of ECMA262 5th Edition and why it wasnt just improved upon.  Some of the features are pretty cool, like generators, iterators, let, new assignment operators and my particular favourite destructuring assignment.p  pI know all of those particular features would just throw errors in browsers with outofdate ECMAScript implementations, but why not include them anyway with the knowlege that one day those implementations would be few and far between  Were there other reasons too  Are we likely to see some of the scrapped features reappear in a future release, or are vendors so scared of breaking compatibility that we will probably never see such improvements to the standardp  pAs an aside, it would be nice to know some opinions on the matter, are you annoyed to see some features cut from the 5th Edition or do you think its better this way  Is it worth playing around with implementations of ECMAScript 4p

Negative 20400 pPerhaps Im misapplying Unity, but here goes.  I have a couple of applications, both of which load the same plugin assemblies.  All assemblies require a library, and I want them to be able to access this library via Unity.  However, in order to use Unity, or any other IoC framework, Id have to write an interface for this library.  I will probably do this, but since an interface isnt really needed for anything other than to support Unity, I am afraid that this means that I am 1 missing the point, or 2 misapplying the framework.  If I avoid something that offers me DI, then Id have to make the library class a singleton, and then pass it to all of the plugin constructors, or via a public property, and I dont want to do this.p  pThat said, and without actually implementing anything with Unity yet, Im not getting one other detail  although Unity will let me request the library via Resolvelt, my plugins will still need to have a reference to the Unity instance that is created in the main applications.  So is this a case where your only option is to pass the Unity reference to all of the plugins, but then its convenient from that point on, merely because you can use Unity to get at all of the other dependenciesp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI realized that I missed the point, but hopefully someone can clarify for me  I shouldnt be passing a ref to Unity everywhere  I should only have to create the container in my app, and then register all of the types afterward.  Then when I instantiate all of my plugins, they should just magically be able to use those registered interfaces, with almost no extra effort, right  In my case, my constructors must be parameterless because my plugin loader cant deal with arguments, and in that case, Ill have to use property injection to give them access to the interfaces, rightp  pstrongANOTHER UPDATEstrongp  pI went ahead and tried out Unity.  I registered the instance of my class thats needed by all plugins.  I also know that I would eventually run into a problem with my plugin loader since they are parameterless and I might need to pass it a ref to Unity to make them work.  However, just for now I am directly creating a plugin, and I am doing that via the Resolve method.  So heres basically what the code looks likep  precode app code ICandySettings candysettings  new CandySettings IUnityContainer unity  new UnityContainer.RegisterInstanceltICandySettingsgt candysettings CandyPlugin plugin  unity.ResolveltCandygt  throws null reference exception, see below.   plugin code public class Candy    [Dependency]   ICandySettings CandySettings  get set     ...    public Candy        CandySettings.GetSettingbox  CandySettings is null  why  Didnt Unity do this for me     codepre  pSo my problem right now is that I would expect given my limited knowledge, that Unity is going to automagically set the plugins CandySettings reference to whatever instance was registered via RegisterInstance, but its not.p  pstrongA WORKING OPTIONstrongp  pIf I skip the smoke and mirrors stuff and just pass my UnityContainer into the plugins constructor, then I can call Unity.Resolve to set the value of my CandySettings property, and everything works great.  Id love to know why the [Dependency] attribute isnt doing what I thought it would.  If Im not mistaken, I actually shouldnt need to pass Unity to each constructor in my plugin loader.  I should just use Unity.Resolve and it would presumably work if [Dependency] is working.  However, now I understand what everyone is saying about how picking an IoC container will then force it on your entire development team.p  pstrongMEFstrongp  pSo far, MEF is winning the battle for me.  Its pretty simple, and the magical smoke and mirrors stuff works great for my needs currently.  But Id still like to get Unity working.  I find it strange that for MEF, I only need to compose the parts and everything else just falls into place, whereas I cant seem to get Unity to just inject stuff automatically, and I have to Resolve everything through a reference to Unity passed everywhere.  This cant be right.p  pstrongMore MEFstrongp  pI like the idea that I can resolve multiple objects with MEF very easily, but what about cases where Im using the Strategy pattern to dictate code behavior  Currently, its as simple as changing the reference from one implementation of a behavior to another, and it emjust worksem.  Does anyone do this with MEF  Is the right way to do it to use ImportMany, and then use extra code to determine which behavior in the list should get invokedp

BaseVars.GlobalWB is a variable which refers to the active workbook Globals.ThisWorkBook.

Im using jQuery, so Im not using any of the builtin JS generators.p  pSo far Ive thought of the followingp  ul lipJust move everything into codeapplication.jscode and take benefit from the new UJS style helpers. This is only a little better than what I have right now because I will end up with a big clunky JS file.pli lipUse a hrefhttpsgithub.comxpepermintjserb relnofollowjserb gema which provides a way to write javascript source code into codeappjavascriptscode and get i18n, HTML templates and compilation automatically.pli lipUse a hrefhttpsgithub.comsstephensonsprocketsrails relnofollowsprocketsrailsa which also seems a good alternative even I have never tried it and Im not sure if its rails3 compatible.pli ul  pDo you have any experiencesuggestion in such topicp

Negative 20400 pThe app uses the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidlocationGeocoder.htmlGeocodera object. It works fine on my stock Froyo Nexus One. But then I run the exact same app on a different device an Advent Vega 10 tablet also running Froyo and I get this exception emService not Availableem. The method Im using is codegetFromLocationNamecode, Im building against the Android 1.6 Google API.p  pIm aware of an issue where this exception is thrown on the emulator, but I suspect this is different. Why would it be thrown on one device running Froyo but not anotherp  pThe app is a location app, and as the tablet has no GPS or mobile network, in a scenario where the WiFi connection doesnt provide a location, the user must manually specify it, so not being able to use the Geocoder object is bad news.p  pI could add a way for the user to select the location on a map, but its not ideal. Possibly I could use the Google Maps API directly, but Im keen to understand the nature of the issue first as would be nice to have an easier solution.p  pHopefully in a future release Android will include an OSlevel default location for nonGeocoder devices, so locationaware apps work out of the box on devices like Google TV.p
Negative 20400 pUsing the standard Eclipsebased development environment to develop Android apps, you press ControlF11 to squirt your app down the USB cable to your phone.  This works great, but if youve done practically any work at all between tests the screen will have timed out and turned off.  You then have to press the power button, then slide the slider, then do the pattern unlock pattern, and only then can you see your app running.  This gets old pretty quickly.p  pIt would be nice to be able to somehow have a message sent down with your app to do all this for you.  p  pI accept that I could probably configure my phone to not turn the screen off, and disable the slider and pattern lock, but I dont really want to as I always want that behaviour when Im not developing.p  pAny idea if the behaviour Im after is possible  Ive looked unsuccessfully for any documentation describing how to customize whatever happens when you send data to the phone.  If possible the solution should be possible from within eclipse, but even having to send it via Terminal I use Ubuntu to develop or something would similar would be better than nothing.p

Negative 20400 pIve developed an application using Visual Studio 2010, which by default compiles to the .NET Framework 4. However, as far as Im aware, my application is not using any .NET 4 specific features and would probably work fine compiled to 33.5 or even 2. The main problem I see with compiling to v4 is that many users wont have the v4 framework installed and so will need to go through the process of downloading and installing it. Is there any performancesecurityetc benefits to running the same code compiled to v4 rather than previous versions which would justify using v4, or should I just use the older versions until I need the new features found in 4p  pAmrp

Negative 20400 pIm developing an application that allows people to request a warranty be generated for a particular job.

This seems a bit messy. The other way to go is to not allow for the deletionmodification of a product from the products table unless there are no warranties attached to it. Perhaps implementing a replacedwith column that points to an edited version of the same product Ive done this in a shopping cart before, and its worked pretty well.

Negative 20400 pSounds a little bit scary isnt itp  pSome background information, I want to load a tar archive which contains some lua modules into my C application using LuaInterface. The easiest way would be to extract these files to a temp folder, modify the lua module search path and read them with require as usual.

I thought something like the following would work.p  pIn my scene assistants setup functionp  precodethis.mySliderModel  value 1 this.controller.setupWidgetmySlider, minValue 0, maxValue 2, this.mySliderModel codepre  pAnd to listen for changes to the sliderp  precodethis.mySliderChangedEventListener  this.mySliderChanged.bindAsEventListenerthis Mojo.Event.listenthis.controller.getmySlider, Mojo.Event.propertyChange, this.mySliderChangedEventListener codepre  pAnd then the listenerp  precodeMainAssistant.prototype.mySliderChanged  functionevent      var sliderValue  Math.roundevent.value     switch sliderValue          case 0         case 1         case 2             its a good value             do some stuff              this.mySliderModel.value  sliderValue             this.controller.modelChangedthis.mySliderModel             break         default             Mojo.Log.infomySlider error value , event.value             break       codepre  pBut changing the model and calling codemodelChangedcode doesnt seem to do anything, although the documentation and example code shows that this can work.  Any ideas why my code doesnt work and what I can do to achieve the desired effectp  pNote  Im aware I could achieve this sort of thing using different widgets, but Id like to do it with a Slider.  Using something else is my backup if I cant find a way to get this working.p

Negative 20400 pIn a project I am currently working on, I need to access 2 databases in LINQ in the following mannerp  ol lipI get a list of all trip numbers between a specified date range from DB1, and store this as a list of long valuespli lipI perform an extensive query with a lot of joins on DB2, but only looking at trips that have their trip number included in the above list. pli ol  pProblem is, the trip list from DB1 often returns over 2100 items  and I of course hit the 2100 parameter limit in SQL, which causes my second query to fail.

Negative 20400 pMy question is related to database design and also how to model that design in Hibernate. I have two tables with the following primary keysp  precodeBLOCK BLOCKID BLOCKSHP BLOCKID, SHAPEVERSION codepre  pBLOCK to BLOCKSHP is a onetomany relationship as a single block can have many different versioned shapes associated with it. So far so good.p  pThe second association is that I also want to be able to get the emcurrentem shape  for the Block. To do this, I have added another attribute to the BLOCK tablep  precodeCURSHAPEVERSION codepre  pBLOCKID and CURSHAPEVERSION now form a foreign key to the BLOCKSHP table on BLOCKID, SHAPEVERSION. Each block may have 0 or 1 current shapes.p  pIn Hibernate, I have set this second association up in the following wayp  pre OneToOne cascade  CascadeType.ALL, optional  true  NotFound action  NotFoundAction.IGNORE  JoinColumns    JoinColumn name  BLOCKID, referencedColumnName  BLOCKID, insertable  false, updatable  false ,   JoinColumn name  CURSHAPEVERSION, referencedColumnName  SHAPEVERSION, insertable  false, updatable  false    public BlockShape getCurrentShape      return currentShape  pre  pThe NotFound annotation was required because Hibernate was having trouble dealing with nullable onetoone associations. If it doesnt find the association it ignores it instead of throwing an error.p  pThis isnt very satisfying to me though, because it means that Hibernate isnt really aware of the proper relationship between the entities. For example, if I query for strongcurrentShape is not nullstrong, Hibernate does not know how to perform this query properly  it is querying on strongblockid is not null or curshapeversion is not nullstrong.p  pSo I guess I have a few questions. First, is there a better way to model this second association in the database Second, is there a better way in Hibernate to set up the annotations for it to better understand the relationship and be able to properly query on the shape tablep  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 20400 pI have an application on Google App Engine that is made of Adobe Flex [and Java] components. The app has buttons to do tasks related to the app, including an Open button, which allows the user to open a .XML file, which then gets converted into datacontent thats displayed in the app GUI. Then I press the Run button and it calculates stuff related to the inputted datacontent. Also, my datastore is setup using JDO. Im using only GAE. Im NOT using GWT.p  pBased on the nature of the calculations algorithms Im running, I would benefit from being able to open an XML file and then click the Run button on my app simultaneously on lets say 5 different versions of my app that I have uploaded to app engine. The 5 versions would be identical. p  pIs there a way to create, say, an HTML page where the user would provide a link to the XML file or openload it from their disk to be processed, then press Go, where then the XML file is passed to all 5 versions of my app, then automatically presses the Run button on each p  pI can do this manually at the moment by going to each versionspecific URL for my app, but it takes too long. Do you have any suggestions for how I would go about setting up such a scriptp  pemEDIT Motivation for the problemem Its not XML processing time that Im worried about. I currently have 2 algorithms that compute the number of particular types of special points that exist in an inputted XML file which contains large amounts of data. The difference between the two algorithms is that the 1st searches until it finds emeveryem special point. Then it stops. The 2nd searches and stops when it finds the first special point it comes across. Using multiple instances of this 2nd algorithm, one has the potential of finding all the points faster than the 1st algorithm.p

Negative 20400 pImagine a website that is highly cached where the output of almost every GET action is cached into a html file that is accessible directly from the HTTP server without having to perform a serverside CGI operation. Now imagine that in addition to that, JavaScript is used to filter the response of the HTML request using AJAX. The AJAX response contains only the appropriate response of the page so for standard HTML pages it will contain everything except for the surrounding layout, for modals it will contain only the modal box HTML, etc....p  pNow lets imagine that the HTML content may be cached neutrally when nobody is logged in or cached for someone who is logged in. There are certain areas of the page that are tied to session data like the welcome message, the profile link, etc... and that data is specific to the session. But since were using JavaScript, we can buffer the AJAX response, change the session element values, and then stick it into the DOM all the while the user is unaware of any session hot swapping. This relies ofcoarse only on GET requests and pages where the actual content is not 100 session dependent.p  pNow here is my question. If I were to implement this and trust me I will then how might I actually keep track of the session activity while the user is browsing the page With a traditional serverside operation, whenever the user accesses a page then the serverside framework will update the session and keep tabs on the sessionrelated variables. With a static HTTP request operation then all serverside involvement is avoided. So I will need to figure out some way of keeping track of whats going on with the session here are my approachesp  pstrong1 Perform two AJAX requests or an additional one when neededstrong Once the user queries a page then the contents will be downloaded as static HTML. But at the same time that page is queried then another AJAX request will be serviced to a sessionspecific URLserver updatingquerying the status of the session. This can be done side by side or can be performed after every few requests are made.p  pPros  HTML files are left unchanged, HTML files can be set to have a ETag or future expires header, JavaScript can cache only the static HTML and use it for offline browsing, a sessionserver can be dedicated, optimized and configured for session activity. Cons  Two AJAX requests are performed, excessive polling for potentially redundant data, session handling made be separated from content server.p  pstrong2 Use a midway proxy that appends the sessiondata as a trailing session JSONstrong A request is made to the server. There is a proxy in between that locally accesses the session data and then performs another HTTP request either locally or remotely which is then concatenated with the session data findings fetched just before. The browser is responded with a clean copy of HTML code where has JavaScriptspecific session content and then everything is updated at the same moment.p  pPros  Everything is downloaded at once, only one connection required, works like a normal HTTP request would Cons  Caching gets difficult when a dynamic content proxy is used, contentlength may need to be search and replaced with to append additional data, may not work with some browsersp  pstrong3 Use Comet for session datastrong A persistant, reverseAJAX comet connection could be established at the start of the website connection. Then, all staticHTML requests could be accessed normally. All sessionrelated requests could be accessed from the comet connection.p  pPros  Separation of static content and dynamic content. Cons  Comet isnt supported very well and doesnt work very well, server latency, may conflict with same origin policy.p  pHow do you guys think this problem should be solved Do you think its doablep

Negative 20400 pHello stackoverflow Subversion community  its a new year and many years since similar questions were asked  and still no answer  Someone out there has to have figured this one out either by a script or configuration setting. I cant believe it isnt limiting more people from using subversion.  p  pI am looking for a way to preserve the file timestamp when files are imported into subversion, committed, and updated on the local system.  The out of the box setup I am and others are using seems to force the date to the commit time  which eliminates the actual timestamp for every file.  I am using TortoiseSVN client and VisualSVN Server on Windows 764.  p  pI worked with ClearCase for years and this was never an issue. With CC the date of the file element was set to the file date when it was imported to the VOB and as it was changed as the file was updated. The file date wasnt set to the time it was checked out or when it was committed unless either the file was changed and checked in or a copy of the file was created and forced to check in to create a new version identical to the previous one.p  pHas anyone come up with a solution to thisbr Would I have better luck with SVN in Linux either for the server, client, or both Does anyone have suggestions of other CM freeware where this isnt a problem  p  pThanksp

Negative 20400 pI have an MVC3 application which is working fast in my dev environment even when pointed at the production database. However, when I publish the application and move it onto the production iis7 environment it runs at a snails pace. I understand that the inital load can take a few seconds as the application pool starts up, but this is taking 20 seconds. Then will be fast for a few clicks and the next click will again take 20 seconds. p  pIve put in the MVCMiniPorifler and it doesnt look like the database is causing problems. But, I also cant see what is causing the problem. I can hit the same page multiple times and it comes back in a second or 2 and then suddenly that same page will take 20 seconds to respond. p  pHas anyone seen this sort of behaviour before Any help would be greatly appreciated and Im not sure what to try next.p

Negative 20400 pShould I always check if code[[NSArray alloc] init]code or with any other collection class returns codenilcode The Apple docs say that objects may return codenilcode if allocation or initialisation fails. I dont know when initialising may fail with codeNSArraycode, but I guess that allocation may fail with insufficient memory. And because Im developing for iOS, that may become a regular problem. Do I have to about that and check emeveryem time I want to create a new array, or will my app fail because of memory constraints assuming worstcase situation, of course and checking for codenilcode is just a waste of cyclesp  pCurrently, Im only checking when I allocate a mutable collection with a large predetermined capacity e.g. code[NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity 1000]code or an immutable collection with lots of objects over a thousand.p  pThank you.p

Negative 20400 pIm building a simple play against a random opponent backend using Goole App Engine. So far Im adding each user that wants to play into a table in the Datastore.

If there are plenty of players signing up I want them to be matched quickly and not have to wait a whole minute worst case.p  pI thought about having the servlet that recives the play against random opponent request POST to a Task Queue that would do the match making, but I think this will lead to a lot of contention when reading from the Datastore and deleting the enteties from the random table after they have been matchedp  pBasically I want a single worker that will do the matching, and I want to signal this worker from time to time that emnowem is a good time to try to match opponents.p  pAny suggestions on what would be the right course of action herep

Negative 20400 pI have a TextBox with a validation rule that is on a tab of a TabControl. The default ErrorTemplate correctly shows red border around TextBox when the validation rule fails.br However if there is a switch to another tab and then back to the tab with the TextBox the ErrorTemplate hightlight is gone.  If there is a change in the TextBox the validation rule is still called and returns false but the error highlight still doesnt show.br Only when the text content is changed to be valid and then again to be invalid does the highligh comeback.br I would like that if the text content is invalid that switching to another tab and back keeps the invalid highlight.  Any ideas to get this behaviour most welcome.br The xaml p  precodeltTextBox Height35 gt   ltTextBox.Textgt     ltBinding Pathpanid UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChangedgt       ltBinding.ValidationRulesgt         ltpsPanIdValidation gt       ltBinding.ValidationRulesgt     ltBindinggt   ltTextBox.Textgt ltTextBoxgt codepre

Negative 20400 pI think we all run into this as a user as well. For example, when Im playing a Youtube video, and the connection is slow, it will not play until enough content has been buffered. But sometimes even after the content arrived it wont resume playing.p  pMost of the times when this happens I just click once somewhere on the player bar and it will resume.p  pNow, I think Ive run into this situation while programming with HTML5 Audio elements and Youtube APIs. Most of the times they work well, but when the connection is spotty, it will just stop and never resume even after content has arrived. Is there a way to get around this problem Thank youp

Negative 20400 pI have a form with jquery validation. I have some custom rules, but they all check out and work fine on other forms. In fact, it works just fine on THIS form except for one specific situation. We have a text input for a URL. We wrote a regex to disallow script tags. And it works fine.p  pIf you fill out the form with errors and submit it, you have error messages. As expected. But this URL field... If you entered a valid URL before failure and then change it to a script tag and click save the error message immediately appears but then the form submits anyway. If you tab away from the field first, you see the error message. But clicking save still saves the form.p  pIve tried using a page load function to disable the form action and to replace the action with a check if the form is valid. If you leave the form blank and click save, you get errors. If you fill it out, you get nothing. Clicking save does nothing at all.p  pHere is my form tag. The fields dont really matter.

Negative 20400 pI subclassed QDoubleSpinBox in order to make a QDoubleSpinBox that allows the user to enter NaN as valid input.  Right now if a user enters nan into the spinbox the control is automatically changing the text to the value of DBLMAX instead of staying as nan.  Before i started using the math.h library with the nan and isnan functions i just defined NANVALUE to be 1000 and the range to be 1000 to 1000.  Then in my textFromValue i checked if value was equal to NANVALUE. Likewise in the valueFromText function i was returning NANVALUE.  When i did it that way it worked but i would like to be able to use the nan and isnan functions instead.  Now that i added in the nan and isnan function calls it stopped working.  Does anyone know why that is  Also, i noticed i had this problem with my earlier implementation when i used DBLMIN and DBLMAX as the range. Are those numbers too big of a range for the control  If i made the range smaller like 1000 and 1000 it worked fine..p  pHere is my implementationp  pCustomDoubleSpinBox.hp  precodeifndef CUSTOMDOUBLESPINBOXH define CUSTOMDOUBLESPINBOXH  include ltQDoubleSpinBoxgt include ltQWidgetgt include ltQtGuigt include ltiostreamgt include ltmath.hgt include ltfloat.hgt include ltlimitsgt  define NUMBEROFDECIMALS 2  using namespace std  class CustomDoubleSpinBox  public QDoubleSpinBox      QOBJECT      public     CustomDoubleSpinBoxQWidget parent  0     virtual CustomDoubleSpinBox throw       double valueFromTextconst QString amptext const     QString textFromValuedouble value const     QValidatorState validate  QString amp input, int amp pos  const   endif  CUSTOMDOUBLESPINBOXH codepre  pCustomDoubleSpinBox.cppp  precodeinclude CustomDoubleSpinBox.h  CustomDoubleSpinBoxCustomDoubleSpinBoxQWidget parent  QDoubleSpinBoxparent      thisgtsetRangeDBLMIN, DBLMAX     thisgtsetDecimalsNUMBEROFDECIMALS   QString CustomDoubleSpinBoxtextFromValuedouble value const      if isnanvalue              return QStringfromStdStringNaN          else              QString result         return result.setNumvalue,f, NUMBEROFDECIMALS        double CustomDoubleSpinBoxvalueFromTextconst QString amptext const      if text.toLower  QStringfromStdStringnan              return nan          else              return text.toDouble        QValidatorState CustomDoubleSpinBoxvalidate  QString amp input, int amp pos  const      QUNUSEDinput     QUNUSEDpos      return QValidatorAcceptable  codepre

Negative 20400 pIve put together a simple key value store which speaks a subset of the a hrefhttpredis.io relnofollowRedisa protocol. It uses pthreads on Linux to share the hash table I use pthreads rwlocks to manage access to this table. Ive been testing the KV store using the Redis benchmark tool.p  pWith a single client, I can do about 2500 SET operations a second. However, it can only do about 25 GETs per second Id expect the other way around, so this surprises me. It scales to some extent, so if I throw 10 clients at it Ill get nearly 9000 SETs per second and around 250 GETs per second.p  pMy GET code is pretty simple I lock the table, find the appropriate hash table location, and check for a matching key in the linkedlist there. For a GET, I use codepthreadrwlockrdlockcode and codepthreadrwlockunlockcode when Im done. For SET, I use codepthreadrwlockwrlockcode and codepthreadrwlockunlockcode. SET is quite a bit more complex than GET.p  pI also made the code work on Plan 9, using sharedmemory processes and their own implementation of readwrite locks. There, GETs are almost as fast as SETs, instead of 100x slower. This makes me think my hash table code is probably ok I use exactly the same hash table code for both OSes, I simply use defines to select the appropriate lock for each OS the interface is the same in both cases, lucky.p  pIm not very experienced with pthreads. Can anyone help me figure out why my performance is sucking so badlyp  pNote this isnt meant to be a highperforming KV store, its meant to be a naively written test applicationbenchmark. It handles requests in about the simplest method possible, by spinning off a new thread for every clientp

Negative 20400 pIve been surfing around for a simple example of how to achieve audio playback onclick in iOS but I cant seem to find one. I understand that Apple has disabled autoplay due to data usage considerations  but what Im trying to do is have audio play when a user clicks on an image  Im by no means a master at javascript and I cant find a simple example to apply to my code so Im hoping someone could demonstrate how youd do this. p  pI entered a simplified version of my code below. Im already using a javascript function to determine whether or not I need serve up an ogg file or mp3 file when the image is clicked. I am also using a JQuery plugin that zooms in on the image when clicked, another that controls some of the font sizes of a couple headlines on the page and a third for chromeframe. I have two separate script tags in the head because I couldnt figure out how to get them all to work in one tag. I know this is sloppy and Im planning to clean it up, but before I do Id like to figure out the audio issue. p  pAnyway, I thought because I already had the audio set up to play on the click of the image it would work in iOS but its not and Im not sure how I should adjust the code. If someone has the time to provide a simple example as a starting point as to how to do this Id really appreciate it. p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltheadgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjqueryjquery.zoomooz.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjqueryjquery.fittext.js.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibschromeframe1CFInstall.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt   Mouseover Click sound effect by JavaScript Kit www.javascriptkit.com  Visit JavaScript Kit at httpwww.javascriptkit.com for full source code   Usage Instantiate script by calling var uniquevarcreatesoundbitesoundfile1,       fallbackfile2, fallebacksound3, etc  Call uniquevar.playclip to play sound  var html5audiotypes define list of audio file extensions and their associated audio    types.

Negative 20400 pAs shown in a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSnetfxbclthread4465cafbf4ed434f89d8c85ced6ffaa8 relnofollowthis post, strongcodeFileSystemWatchercodestrong is unreliablea because of Windows disk caching. The poster showed that the class misses roughly 0.15  0.35 of all events regardless of optimizations and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.filesystemwatcher.internalbuffersize.aspx relnofollowInternalBufferSizea. Even drivers suffer from this, so its not inherently a fault of FileSystemWatcher.p  pThe poster suggests a way to deal with this problem  flushing entire volume. However I dont want to do that  the cache is there for a reason and it requires admin privileges. Is it possible to flush just the watched directory and achieve the same results of making FileSystemWatcher 100  accurate I dont know much about a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36443928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowstrongFlushFileBuffersstronga, but the posters solution specifically flushes entire volume, even though flushing just the directory would be obviously a better solution.p  pIs there any .NET way to flush a directory or a specified file nonopened I mean the strongreal flushstrong, which waits for confirmation from the disk itself. For example, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary2bw4h516.aspx relnofollowFileStream.Flushvoida flushes just the .NET buffers, but not the OS buffer unlike a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee474552.aspx relnofollowFileStream.Flushboola with emtrueem argument in .NET 4 and better. I want to flush files opened by other apps.p  pIf not, is it even possible to use FlushFileBuffers to flush a directory maybe it supports just files and volumes, which would be weird though Also a nonadmin solution would be more than ideal, because in admin mode I could just use Change Journal.p

The developer docs are quite clear about what needs to be done and why such a response might be producedp  blockquote   pCanonical IDsp      pOn the server side, as long as the application is behaving well,   everything should work normally. However, if a bug in the application   triggers multiple registrations for the same device, it can be hard to   reconcile state and you might end up with duplicate messages.p      pGCM provides a facility called canonical registration IDs to easily   recover from these situations. A canonical registration ID is defined   to be the ID of the last registration requested by your application.   This is the ID that the server should use when sending messages to the   device.p      pIf later on you try to send a message using a different registration   ID, GCM will process the request as usual, but it will include the   canonical registration ID in the registrationid field of the   response. Make sure to replace the registration ID stored in your   server with this canonical ID, as eventually the ID youre using will   stop working.p blockquote  pSo within my Android client app I have a development only button which will register the device with GCMRegistrar.register a second time without bothering to unregister it first. I had assumed that this would get me a registrationid different from the first time I registered it, and that sending a message to the device from the web maybe using the old id would give me a response with a canonicalid. p  pstrongHowever the second registration returns exactly the same regid as the first time.strongp  pThus sending a message via the PHP on my server wont show a canonicalid in the response. I really need to test the situation where a canonicalid is returned, indicating that I need to update my database as my PHP skills are not the finestp  pSo any ideas as to how I could provoke such a response would be gratefully receivedp  pUpdate I just tried uninstalling the app from the phone, then reinstalling it. I still get the same regid.p

Negative 20400 pI have an app that resizes itself for different views usingp  precodeNSSize currentSize  [[box contentView] frame].size NSSize newSize  [v frame].size float deltaWidth  newSize.width  currentSize.width float deltaHeight  newSize.height  currentSize.height NSRect windowFrame  [w frame] windowFrame.size.height  deltaHeight windowFrame.origin.y  deltaHeight windowFrame.size.width  deltaWidth  [box setContentView nil] [w setFrame windowFrame     display YES     animate YES]  [box setContentView v] codepre  pWhen you change the view, the window growsshrinks based on the upperleft corner of the app. The app always starts on the first view, no matter which view the user was in when they quit, because this is a summary view. I also want it to be restorable so the lastused document is open on launch.p  pstrongThe problemstrong since most views are taller than the summary view, changing to one pushes the bottom left corner of the window farther down the screen. Now quit the app and relaunch, and the app positions the window to where that bottom left corner was previously. I know this is because thats where Cocoa puts the origin, but it makes more sense for the user to have the window restart with the same emtopem left corner, otherwise the app is shifting down the screen each time its opened.p  pI tried observing NSWindowWillCloseNotification and calling the above method again to reset the app to the summary view just before closing, but even though the code works, the window still starts in the wrong position  Im guessing Cocoa sets an apps restorable defaults before the notification is sent.p  pstrongIts been done beforestrong System Preferences does it  it autoresizes for views, dictates what your starting view is, but you can move the window and next time you open it, itll be in the new position based on the top left corner. Anyone have an idea how to emulate thatp  pstrongEditstrong Document.xib has a small window with a popup button and a box. The methods below change the views and resize the window to fit those views. Everything works fine while the app is open, the window shifting is only an issue when the app is closed and reopened with an active document ie. using Lions restore.p  pre            Jump to                    The  is the top and bottom edge of the window                                     The  is the popup menu for selecting the view           The dashed box on the inside is box, which holds the views                                                                                                                                                                                                        pre  precode voidwindowControllerDidLoadNibNSWindowController aController      [super windowControllerDidLoadNibaController]      Note that init creates the array viewControllers     NSMenu menu  [viewMenu menu]     NSUInteger i, itemCount     itemCount  [viewControllers count]      for i  0 i lt itemCount i          NSViewController vc  [viewControllers objectAtIndexi]         NSMenuItem mi  [[NSMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle [vc title] action selectorchangeViewController keyEquivalent]         [mi setTag i]         [menu addItem mi]           [self displayViewController [viewControllers objectAtIndex 0]]     [viewMenu selectItemAtIndex 0]    void displayViewController ManagingViewController  vc      End editing     NSWindow w  [box window]     BOOL ended  [w makeFirstResponderw]     if ended          NSBeep         return           Put view in box     NSView v  [vc view]      NSSize currentSize  [[box contentView] frame].size     NSSize newSize  [v frame].size     float deltaWidth  newSize.width  currentSize.width     float deltaHeight  newSize.height  currentSize.height     NSRect windowFrame  [w frame]     windowFrame.size.height  deltaHeight     windowFrame.origin.y  deltaHeight     windowFrame.size.width  deltaWidth      [box setContentView nil]     [w setFrame windowFrame display YES animate YES]      [box setContentView v]     IBActionchangeViewControlleridsender      NSUInteger i  [sender tag]     ManagingViewController vc  [viewControllers objectAtIndex i]     [self displayViewController vc]  codepre  pI tried putting the first block of suggested code from trudyscousin just below the for loop in codewindowControllerDidLoadNibcode and that anchored the window correctly, but when the code reaches codedisplayViewControllercode it sets currentSize  6,6. Im not sure if thats because the box is empty in IB. It then adds the difference between 6,6 and the size of the SummaryView to the size of the window when the app last quit, making it huge.p  pI then tried using NSUserDefaults by adding two lines to codechangeViewControllercodep  precodeNSUserDefaults userDefaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] [userDefaults setInteger i forKey lastViewController] codepre  pand in codewindowControllerDidLoadNibcodep  precodeNSUserDefaults userDefaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     if [userDefaults integerForKey lastViewController]          NSInteger i  [userDefaults integerForKey lastViewController]         ManagingViewController vc  [viewControllers objectAtIndex i]         NSView v  [vc view]         NSSize currentSize  [v frame].size         [box setFrameSize currentSize]         [self displayViewController vc]         [viewMenu selectItemAtIndex i]      else          [self displayViewController [viewControllers objectAtIndex 0]]         [viewMenu selectItemAtIndex 0]      codepre  pThis works, but forces the app to launch with the last used view, which wouldnt be so bad except that it will even do that when a new document is openedcreated. If I get rid of the else i.e., always run those last 2 lines, Im back to where I started  the app launches being shifted vertically down the screen. It looks like you cant set the windows origin at launch, or maybe it reloads its own defaults at a later point.p  pThe last thing I did was go back to my starting code not using the mask code provided by trudyscousin but at the bottom of codewindowControllerDidLoadNibcode I addedp  precode[self performSelector selectoradjustOrigin withObject nil afterDelay0.0f] codepre  pwhich callsp  precode void adjustOrigin      NSUserDefaults userDefaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     if [userDefaults integerForKey lastViewController]          NSInteger i  [userDefaults integerForKey lastViewController]         ManagingViewController vc  [viewControllers objectAtIndex i]         NSView v  [vc view]         NSSize previousSize  [v frame].size         NSSize currentSize  [[[viewControllers objectAtIndex 0] view] frame].size         CGFloat delta  previousSize.height  currentSize.height         NSRect windowFrame  [[box window] frame]         windowFrame.origin.y  delta         [[box window] setFrame windowFrame displayYES]       codepre  pThat actually does work, but if multiple things are running, the lag is enough that you can see the window make the jump to its new origin, which is a little inelegant.p

Negative 20400 pI have a universal app with seperate xibs for iPhone and iPadp  pFor the iPad version, I want my one of my iPad xibs in landscape mode.  I have set it to landscape in simulated metrics, The app is set for portrait in the summary screen and the landscape view still shows in portrait when run.  Im sure I read on here a naming convention that tells the app the xib is in landscape ie codeview1one.xibipadlandscapecode p  pIve tried using screen rotation methods but iOS 6 screen rotation is just proving so frustrating as I have tried so many solutions all of which have no effect.  I have done screen rotation before in iOS 6 but I was using storyboards and subclassed a navigation controller for my chosen view, I dont know how to do this with this code as I picked it ip from someone elsep  pSo to sum up How can I get my screen to respect  the landscape xib I have created in interface builder instead of showing it in portraitp  pI would point out I have searched on here for a solution and spent many hours on this before posting thisp

Negative 20400 pIve been exploring different methods of structuring my ColdFusion applications and Im looking for some opinions on the best way to provide application wide UDFs.p  pFor each of my apps, I generally use a bunch of extra functions that dont really belong in any particular object. Data manipulation stuff mostly. I want these functions to be available throughout my application, both for use in CFM templates and in Application instantiated CFCs.p  pThe way I see it there are various methods of achieving this, but they all have their own limitationsp  ol lipInstantiate a base Utils CFC in the Application scope. This is the method Ive used most often. All the functions are available app wide, but if I instantiate the same CFC from multiple applications then theyll each have their own application scope  meaning that each has to instantiate their own base Utils CFC. Theres nothing wrong with this but it feels like Im not encapsulating the CFC well enough. Im not keen on referencing the Application scope from within the CFC.pli lipCreate an base Utils CFC and make every other CFC extend this. This works fine, and it means the CFC can reference the Utils functions directly from the CFCs THIS scope  However it means the Utils functions are kept in memory for every CFC. It also doesnt sit right conceptually as my other CFCs have no relationship with the Utils CFC.pli lipInject my base Utils CFC into my other CFCs. Another method Ive been playing with is instantiating my base Utils CFC in the Application scope, but then passing that as an object to an argument in my other CFCs. This works for me conceptually, and for encapsulation. In the same way that Ill set up my datasources in my init method, I can do the same with my UDFs. This has the same issue that the UDFs are included in each CFC. When I dump all my CFCs I get each UDF multiple times  however as Im passing an instantiated object, Im assuming that its not taking any extra memory space.  If anyone could confirm that, itd be helpful  Im just assuming The only real problem I have with this method is that it seems a bit convoluted. pli lipHave my Application CFC extend my Utils CFC. This is what a lot of frameworks seem to do. Ive not used this method, but Im sure there are pros and cons.pli lipCFInclude my UDFs from separate templates, directly in Application.cfc This is functionally similar to instantiating in the Application scope.pli lipAdd my UDFs to the servers codeComponents.cfccode  Its a great idea in theory  I can maintain one copy of the base Utils and be sure that everything on the server can access them  However, if I want to run apps across multiple servers then theyll all need those functions. Plus any update to the server may overwrite the components. It just feels like hacking the core  which Im sure we can all atest from bitter experience, is bad.pli ol  pSo  my question is this What is the best practice for extending CF with UDFs in an elegant and reusable way Any of the above options or something Ive not thought ofp

We then create a variable           int port which also stores the reference to the method getPort           from the MyHttpRequest which gives us the port number of the avaya server           we are contacting, if it is less than or equal to 0 it will be set to 80 as           a default                   String host  request.getHost         int port  request.getPort         if port lt 0              port  80                              Create the variable bookSoc of type Socket and is given the paramters of host and port           which is used in creating the socket to connect to the server                    Socket bookSoc  new Sockethost, port                    Declares a variable called response, which allows us to assign the MyHttpResponse object to the          response variable. This stores a reference to the MyHttpResponse Object and allows us to reference and use          the methods in the MyHttpResponse Object                  MyHttpResponse response  new MyHttpResponse                     Creates the a variable fromServer of type BufferedReader which is given the parameter of new           InputStreamReader which then opens up the stream using the bookSoc.getInputStream method.                   BufferedReader fromServer  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderbookSoc.getInputStream         The variable toServer of type PrintWriter creates the OutPutStream which allows to output to the           Avaya Server                   PrintWriter toServer  new PrintWriterbookSoc.getOutputStream, true         String method  request.getMethod                      The if statement works by checking if the the Method call equals a GET then           create the string path and queryString to print out to the server the path and host           which we require                   if method.equalsGET              String path  request.getPath             String queryString  request.getQueryString             toServer.printlnGET   path     HTTP1.0             toServer.printlnqueryString             toServer.printlnGET   host             toServer.printlnport                             Creates a variable called line of type String               which will then be used to store the fromServer message, then we creates               another var called status of type int which the substring which count the               characters given.

Negative 20400 pI have a question about which type of service I should be using to run the uploading and downloading of data in my application. p  pSpecifically it seems like a bound service obtained by calling bindService is really more applicable since my background work is not running indefinitely and my understanding is that that is really the purpose of using startServiceSTARTSTICKY. p  pThat said, I am running long uploads and downloads, and I do emnotem want my service garbage collected midway through an uploaddownload regardless of what is going on with the applications UI sent to background etc. As I understand it, if I have a bound service, it will be garbage collected as soon as the all the connections have been unbound. Does this mean my bound service would stop potentially midway through what it is doingp  pCan anyone point me in the right direction here Thanks in advance p
Negative 20400 pI am creating an bilingual ASP.NET MVC application. As I know there are two ways to make it bilingual   p  pFirst option is to use resource files. If I would use it resources I would need now about 20 fields. If application grows this might happen, of course   I will need it more and more fields. But this solution I believe is quite flexible solution.p  pSecond option is to create separate view files for example Index.aspx, Index.en.aspx... If there will be more than one or two languages it can become messy I would have a lot of files. Otherwise, I wouldnt need to worry if translation is made correct or not.p  pMy question is which choice would be more useful or have more advantages  What do you think would be advantages and disadvantages of using one or another option Also, if I would decide to use separate pages, wherehow I should define which one of pages to load  Maybe there is even better option to make bilingual applicationp

Negative 20400 pI am currently working on a webpage as a hobby project with some neat animations using jquery and css3 that responds to the how the user drags his mouse on the page. Here is a summary of how I worked on it so you can get my real problem. p  pI have a div at the bottom of the page which acts as a sensor. If I click on this element and drag with the mouse , some animations mainly some play with transitions  will play on the main page.  p  precodeltdiv classsomeclassgtltdivgt codepre  h2Jqueryh2  precodesomeclass  .someclass  someclass.mouseenterfunction    do something  someclass.mousedownfunctioned     several things with ed.pageX, ed.pageY coordinates    someclass.mousemovefunctionem       plenty of things with em.pageX, em.pageY coordinates    .mouseupfunction  someclass.unbindmousdown    .mouseleavefunction         someclass.unbindmouseenter   codepre  pEverything works fine except that since this is click and drag intensive, some of the text elements get highlighted. I looked around for solutions on the net but using preventDefault for mousedown as suggested in other answers doesnt work for me. It fails to do anything with the mousedown event so I didnt want that. p  pUsing selection on the CSS and setting the background to Transparent does not give me the required result either. The text still stays highlighted.p  pI played around with disabling the userselect on css that some suggested and that was another day wasted in my life.p  pSo I thought of a hack. Instead of using a div I used an input field.p  pp  pI know that when you click on the text field and drag outside of it , it will not select any other text on the page.It locks the sucker in the box so yeah All the events like mousedown, mousemove and all work as well, obviously. So I went ahead and made the modifications and everything works well p  pBut  there is one issue. When I click on this input field and drag , it only focuses it on the first click. I have to click and drag on it again for the animations to work. I tried  someclass.focus at document ready and it gets focused as well but until and unless I physically click on the input field , it refuses to detect my mousemove.p  pI triggered someclass.mousedown on someclass.mouseenter. Now, its that if I enter leave and enter again on this element , I can click and drag and all the animations work. So this case there is no need for clicking on the text field twice. p  pI tried triggering mouseenter, mouseleave e.t.c. multiple combinations of this to just get this stupid text to focus without my mouses help.p  pBut I want this to work properly. Im guessing i have to work with mouseenter but I just burned out trying. I searched around to see if anyone is using this method but nay, nothing even close to what Im looking for. p  pThanks in advance for your help. p  pCheersp

Negative 20400 pI am using System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting to vizualize data of a waveform.

Negative 20400 pI want to write a program or script that will allow one to make simple changes to a PHP files. There are codeltdivarticlegtcode tags which are basically just some text and maybe a photo. Basically, whenever a new article is written I have to use SFTP the file over, add a new codeltdivarticlegtcode with some text and SFTP it back over.p  pThis is basically because I dont like spending my time adding articles to PHP, and would rather have the authors just enter their text, and maybe upload a picture or embed a youtube video. The authors all have readwrite access to the server, so editing could be done client side as opposed to writing the code in the webpage.p  pWhat would be a good way of automating this process I was thinking about writing a program to just SFTP the php files, edit them, and reupload them, but if someone has a better idea just let me know.p  pMy strongest languages are C and Java, but I have been fiddling around with Python and Visual Basic. I would be willing to learn a new language if it greatly simplified this.p

Negative 20400 pIve created a simple grid based UICollectionView but Im having trouble with the scrolling. If I touch the view itself rather than a cell within it then it seems to scroll correctly but if I touch one of the cells and try to scroll then nothing happens. This is a bit of an issue, as I basically want the grid of cells to completely fill the view, and when the view is filled like that there is nowhere to touch that will actually make it scroll I guess the easiest way to describe what Im trying to achieve is a table view but with two columns of cells rather than one.p  pI cant seem to find anything in the documentation that talks about this issue and Ive tried various combinations of user interaction enabled settings etc.p  pOne final thing, I do require the cells to respond to a single tap touch basically to toggle them on and off so I dont want to completely disable them responding to touches. p
Negative 20400 pstrong[EDIT]  I guess people had problem to understand exactly what I mean, so I completely rewrote my explanations.strongp  pI work on a project where users can define a date format used in the whole site. It uses PHP date format standard. For example  yearmonthday is set by Ymd.p  pPHP standard uses singlecharacter symbols like emY, m, d, F, jem to describe the date format. As seen in the documentation  a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualfrfunction.date.php relnofollowhttpwww.php.netmanualfrfunction.date.phpap  pSometimes users can select a date thanks to a jQueryUI Datepicker. This component describes its date format with codewords like emyy, y, mm, dd, D, ...em a hrefhttpapi.jqueryui.comdatepickerutilityformatDate relnofollowhttpapi.jqueryui.comdatepickerutilityformatDateap  pI would like to display the dates in the same format for both PHP and the Datepicker. I mean that PHP should output the date as in the format set by user, AND the Datepicker should show the selected date in strongthe same formatstrong.p  pGiven thatp  ol listrongThe date format is necessarily described PHP stylestrongli listrongI cant know a priori which format was set by usersstrongli ol  p This not a problem of how to readparsedisplay a date from a known format.p  pUnfortunately, Javascript date format description is not the same as in PHP. For instance, these 2 date formats are equivalent but described differently in PHP and Javascriptp  ol liPHP  Ymd set by usersli liJavascript  yymmddli ol  pAs you can see, I cannot just configure the datepicker with the PHP date format, because it will be misunderstood, or not recognized at all.p  pSomeone in answers below adviced to create my own date format standard converter, matching each PHP symbol with its equivalent in JS date format description. Just likep  ul liY  yyli lim  mmli lid  ddli liy  yli liz  oli li...li ul  pAnd then replace each PHP symbol with the JS one.

As in the GUI figure it only displays the final frame. p  pIs there some sort of periodic interrupt function I can use in my GUI code that will continuously update the animation or where can I find some main type of function where I can add code as it waits for the GUI interrupts any other ideasp  pHere is the code running the animation.p  precodesimulationon  1 for j2lengtht     if simulationon  1,         figure2         clf         hold on         scale  3 scale the simulation drawing         framesize  1         foot  [0 0]         body  [0.01scale lb2scale]         pbody  [radiusshaftscale lengthshaftscale] set body width,1 and hight,1         pfoot  [foot1body2sinab3setj foot2body2cosab3setj] set x position,1 and Y position,2         pw1foot  [pfoot1lengthshaftsinap1setjscale pfoot2lengthshaftcosap1setjscale]         pw2foot  [pfoot1lengthshaftsinap2setjscale pfoot2lengthshaftcosap2setjscale]         pwbody  [0.01scale 0.01scale]         drawingfoot,body,ab3setjpi,framesize,g         drawingpfoot,pbody,ap1setjpi,framesize,r         drawingpw1foot,pwbody,ap1setjpi,framesize,r         drawingpfoot,pbody,ap2setjpi,framesize,b         drawingpw2foot,pwbody,ap2setjpi,framesize,b         pausetimestep         hold off     end end codepre  pthe drawing function just uses codefillcode to draw the figure parameters. p

Negative 20400 pGiven a matrix of size codeNxMcode of code0code and code1code. If a mouse is present at code[ij]code then it would be code1code, otherwise it would be code0code. We have to start from code[00]code and reach code[n1m1]code. We can go down or right only. A mouse at position code[ij]code will scare us if we pass through a position code[xy]code such that codeixjylt1code.p  pFind a path in which we are scared by minimum number of distinct mice. Mind the word distinct i.e. a mouse if has scared us then it wont scare us again.p  pThis question was asked in an interview.

Negative 20400 pWe have a project in which we use the SketchUp 8 C API to extract information from a SketchUp file.  We have been told by a SketchUp team member that the deprecated C frameworks bundled with the SketchUp 2013 SDK can be used instead to read SKP 2013 files using the deprecated C API.  This isnt working out of the box, and its unclear what Im doing wrong.  Im posting my question on stackoverflow in case its useful to others.p  pIm building my project using XCode 3.2.2, on Mountain Lion, building to a base SDK of OS 10.5 i386.  p  pI removed my XCode projects SketchUp.framework and SketchUpReader.framework, and added those included in the SKP 2013 SDKs deprecatedSkpReaderBinariesMac folder.  Doing a Clean all targets and Build produces thousands of errors.  Some examplesp  precode...SketchUpReader.frameworkHeadersVariant.h79 error multiple definition of enum VARENUM   ...SketchUpReader.frameworkHeaderswindef.h217 error variable or field Sleep declared void  ...SketchUpReader.frameworkHeaderscomptr.h17 error redefinition of class NoAddRefReleaseOnCComPtrltTgt codepre  pMost of the errors are of this form  something has a previous definition.p  pMy first thought was that it was still including the old version of the C frameworks from somewhere, and the new and old were conflicting, but I dont see any other reference to sketchup frameworks in the Xcode projects list of frameworks, or in LibraryFrameworks.p  pIm not terribly versed in building C projects or in using XCode, so this could be a naive question all around, but if anyone knows offhand whats going on here Id appreciate some guidance.  p

Negative 20400 pReference counting would seem to be much quicker to remove stuff than a markandsweep garbage collector, as things can be freed and the memory recycled as soon as it is no longer used. The problem that markandsweep aims to solve is catching circular references, but in exchange you have to walk the entire object tree, and everything else has to pause while this happens.p  pWouldnt it be better to keep reference counting, and use markandsweep periodically, only when memory is low Markandsweep GC pauses are a big pain and hard to predict or avoid. If the engine supported reference counting as well, it could possibly reduce the need for them a lot  even to zero if you are careful to avoid circular references.p  pI notice that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq90622093408Python uses this kind of schemea, but possibly more for historical reasons than as a deliberate performance decision.p

Negative 20400 pI originally come from PHP and I have just started with ASP.NET.  I am aware that a direct equivalent of codeincludefilename.phpcode does not exist, but thats not exactly what I want to achieve.p  pI am attempting to create a header file which I can use on every page.  I have read from many sources that making a user control is the solution. After creating all of the necessary code to make this work, I arrived at a point where the actual element on the page isnt actually created at the point when I call .InnerHtml.  For examplep  precodebreadcrumbContainer.InnerHtml  testing text codepre  pThe above code does not work when called within my file which is called codeheader.ascx.cscode even though there is a div on the page with coderunatservercode and the correct ID.p  pI am trying to find out if there is an easier way to resolve this problem.  I have been told that I should avoid masterpages even though I dont know if they are relevant in this situation. Should I create some sort of method which creates the html for the header, this way I can easily call it on every page Are there any other solutions I havent thought ofp  pIf there are any good articles which clearly explain this problem, I would love the links.  I have literally searched hundreds of pages on the web and found nothing that is giving me a clear understanding of how to resolve this problem.p
Negative 20400 pI have a multitenant database with strict and critical data separation between clients. Before putting it into production, I would like to know if my approach makes sense or could lead to problems down the road securityperformancemaintenance. Below 2 models are the typical scenariop  precodepublic class Car      [Key, ColumnOrder0]     public int carId getset      [Key, ColumnOrder1]     public int clientId getset      ...      public virtual ICollectionltComponentgt components getset   public class Component      [Key, ColumnOrder0]     public int componentId getset      [Key, ColumnOrder1]     public int clientId getset      ...      [ForeignKeycarId, clientId]     public Car car getset     public int carId getset  codepre  pThis way, every model has the clientId as a Primary Key, forcing it to be used with .Find and forcing it into jointables for manymany relationships. That means theres quite a bit of redundancy and the clientId is used when a query is actually quite safe for data separation.p  pDoes it make sense to force the clientId into just anything or might it be better to only keep it on the parent modelsp

I want to combine all 5 of these tables so on one line I can have the DONORCONTACTID which his information, and then all of the Recipients information. p  pThe problem is that when I try to run a query, it does not work because not all of the Donors have all of the recipient fields filled, so the query will run and give a blank table. Some instances I have a Donor with 4 Recipients and other times I have a Donor with only 1 Recipient so this causes a problem. Ive tried running queries where I connect them with the DONORCONTACTID but this will only work if all of the RECIPIENT fields are filled.

My questions arep  ol lipDo I understand correctly that the   VAR instead of , VAR is what makes the difference pli lipIf that is the case, then is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15255694pythonmysqldbexecutetablevariablethis posta also an example or is there something different with using the  to designate a table vs a clause pli ol  pIt is noteworthy to mention Ive tried learning more about SQL Injection. Not sure if Im too dense or the material is but im just not following. In this a hrefhttpwww.cisco.comwebaboutsecurityintelligencesqlinjection.html relnofollowarticle by ciscoa I tried to follow, I find that there is no mention of a percent but instead they appear to be using . So if someone can point me to some laymans documentation I would appreciate thatp

Negative 20400 pI am using CloudFront to front requests to our service hosted outside of amazon. The service is protected and we expect an Authorization header to be passed by the applications invoking our service.p  pWe have tried invoking our service from Cloud Front but looks like the header is getting dropped by cloud front. Hence the service rejects the request and client gets 401 forbidden response. For some static requests, which do not need authorization, we are not getting any error and are getting proper response from CloudFront.p  pI have gone through CloudFront documentation and there is no specific information available on how headers are handled and hence was hoping that they will be passed as is, but looks like thats not the case.

Negative 20400 h2Backgroundh2  pMy Eclipse RCP application is built using Tycho.  It consists of multiple components in the form of OSGi bundlesEclipse plugins. One of these component contains the product file and materializes the product.p  pThere is a reactor POM at the application root, which builds all components in order, but I also want to build other components independently using codemvn deploycode .p  pBuilding such a single component works as followsp  ol liRetrieve the latest versions of all the components dependencies from our company p2 repository.li liBuild the component.li liDeploy the component to our company repository to be used as a dependency for other components itself.li ol  pNote Our repository is a normal emmaven2em repository hosted on a Nexus, whose RCP artifacts are automatically mapped to a p2 repository format as well. This way, Tycho can use the p2 repository format to find dependencies, while the standard Maven deployment can be used. This works fine.p  pNote My parent POM makes sure that we look for dependencies at the p2 repository URL. The deployment URL is the default maven2 format location of the repository. This works fine.p  h2Problemh2  pWhen building such a single component through the commandline codemvn deploycode, Maven looks for emintraprojectem dependencies in the p2 repository and they are correctly resolved i.e. latest version is automatically downloaded and used in build.p  pHowever, when developing in Eclipse, the IDE cannot resolve them. The manifest files gives an error at each of my intraproject dependencies that they cannot be resolved.p  h2Questionh2  pMy question is How can I make the Eclipse IDE look for dependencies and new versions of dependencies in eitherp  ul liMy local p2 repository code.m2repositoryp2osgibundlescodeli liMy company p2 repository codenexus.mycompany.commyproductsnapshots.metap2codeli ul  pIdeally, it would look for them every time and fetch the latest version if a newer version is available.p  pIf it does not use the p2 repository URLs in the POM, how should I configure Eclipsep  h2Exampleh2  pConsider an eclipse plugin codecom.mycompany.myproduct.fancycode, which depends on another eclipse plugin codecom.mycompany.myproduct.corecode. p  pBoth also have a POM configured for Tycho use, which through their parent POM have my Nexus repositories configured correctly maven2 repository URL for deployment and p2 repository URL to look for dependencies.p  pFirst I deploy the codecorecode plugin to my maven repository using the default codemvn deploycode. The Nexus repository will provide this deployed plugin in both maven and p2 format.p  pWhen I build the codefancycode component through the command line using codemvn installcode, the earlier deployed core component is found and downloaded automatically. p  precodeprojectcom.mycompany.myproduct.fancy mvn clean install ltsearches in p2 repository, download coregt ltbuilds fancygt ltSUCCESSgt codepre  pWhen I open a new Eclipse workspace and open the codefancycode component, its Manifest which contains its dependencies gives the following errorp  precodeBundle com.mycompany.myproduct.core cannot be resolved. codepre  pMy question is how can I develop the codefancycode component in the Eclipse IDE without the need to open codecorecode as  project in Eclipse.p  h2Speculationh2  pThis is some speculation from my side. Please correct me if Im wrong and any other solution to the actual problem is also welcomep  ul lipI know the emm2eem plugin of the Eclipse IDE currently maps Maven POMs to Eclipse concepts using m2e connectors. I have installed the dedicated Tycho connectors. For example, the mvn compile step is actually performed by the Eclipse JDT compiler.pli lipI also know that when a complete Tycho product is started in Eclipse, it is run in the Eclipse PDE environment. For example, I need to a specify a target platform in my Run configuration.pli lipI know I can open all components in my Eclipse workspace. This would solve the problem, but is not feasible as I have many components and this would break independent component development.pli lipI assume the Eclipse m2e mapping andor the PDE build environment is not smart enough to fetch latest dependencies automatically at build time. Please correct me if Im wrong. pli lipTherefore, I assume I need to specify the target platform at build time too. I have taken a look at emWindow  Preferences  Plugin Development  Target Platformem. I can add our p2 repository to the Target Platform, which solves the problem. However this gives many problemsp  ul liI need a feature containing all components for this to work. Only features can be added.li liEvery time I deploy a new build of a single component, I would have to rebuild the complete feature to create a new feature version on our p2 repository.li liEvery time I update a component and build the feature, I would have to manually change the Target Platform.li ulli lipIf the above is all correct, I speculate I need an m2e connector or a different one from the current one that actually checks the p2 repositories specified in the POM when resolving the OSGi dependencies and automatically adds those to the target platform.pli ul

Negative 20400 pI have been looking around and I cant find a way to do this as I want. p  pI have MigraDoc creating a PDF that can be one page or more, the header on the first page I would like to be different to every other page.

This is something that I have found to do usingp  pcodeSection.PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter  Truecode p  pThe problem that I have is that this also means that the footer that will not change at all does not show up on the first page. For the Footer I am using a table codeSection.Footers.Primary.AddTablecode. p  pI could use a quick fix by just copying the table footer and pasting it with it changed to codesection.Footers.FirstPage.AddTablecode but then I would have a ton of code that is just messy and not needed as the footer does not change, is there a way around thisp  pAny help would be great.

Negative 20400 pI want to have a filter on the class below Debate. By default I get a filter containing title, published and url. That is fine but when I try filter on the URL I get the following exception. java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.net.URL, see bottom for a full stack trace.p  pTo get around this I added an associatedProperties of url.authority, see below.

Negative 20400 pI really need some help, since iOS 7 I have had nothing but trouble with codeUISwitchcode.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pAfter moving the view up when the keyboard is displayed and restoring it to original position, I then turn any codeUISwitchcode onoff it will work OK, however it will Bounce Down during the animation. this only seems to happen to codeUISwitchcodes that have the code.thumbTintColorcode attribute. by that I mean codeself.borders.thumbTintColor  [UIColor redColor]code when the switch is off and codeself.borders.thumbTintColor  [UIColor greenColor]code when switch is on. p  pFor clarity everything works well until the moving of the view emI cant not do this as you are not able to see the text fieldem.p  pI have searched everywhere emincluding the class referenceem and I havent found anything helpful, or anyone else with this problem.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI have tried setting the strongUISwitch thumTintColorstrong various ways, everything works fine until I move the view up to compensate for the Keyboard. if I drag the switch either on my strongiPadstrong or via simulator on and off slowly the bounce down occurs halfway and when the color changes from green to red or red to green depending on state, I think this is an actual IOS7 strongUISwitchstrong Bug. I really do not want to use a third part switch plug in on my app, so not sure what to do now, one would of thought that changing the tint color on the thumb would not have been such a huge problem.p  pI have tried turning off the animation from on to off  off to on makes no difference.p  pI have created a new strongUISwitchstrong via code not strongIBstrong and the same problem exists.p  pcreated a new test app with only a switch and text box to test and the same thing occurs.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  p1 My thoughts are this is a genuine bug. How do i log it with apple emnever done it beforeem so if someone can point me to the correct place i would be grateful.p  p2 I am now thinking of using Buttons as switches, but feel that is not the way to go, are there any practical reasons not to do so i.e problems submitting the app to the App store etcp

Negative 20400 pI have a thirdparty jar that is a dependency of my project.  Because of business constraints, I do not have access to an enterprise or company repository, which would definitely be my preference for this issue.  But regardless, this thirdparty jar is not available publicly, and so it is included in the web project under codesrcmainresourcescode.  p  pThis is a Maven project, and so I list this thirdparty jar as a compile time dependency, and include in my pom a build plugin that will install the thirdparty jar to my local repository as part of the build process I tell Maven to perform this goal during the codevalidatecode phase of the build lifecycle, which to my knowledge would be before any other Maven phase.  p  pHowever, when I run a codeclean installcode and have my local repository cleared out, the build fails due to the thirdparty jar not being resolvable locally or in the Maven central repository.  As far as I know, I have set up the pom correctly and I should be seeing Maven attempt to install the thirdparty jar locally before it begins dependency resolution.p  pThe issue is that if the dependency is listed before the jar has ever been installed locally, the build will fail due to being unable to resolve that dependency.  If I remove the thirdparty jar declaration and run the build, emafterem dependency resolution occurs which is the very first thing it does after the clean, but before any other phase, it will locally install the jar and things are fine.  But to my knowledge, it should run the codevalidatecode phase before it collects and resolves dependencies, and so the jar emshouldem be locally installed before its resolved by Maven.

Negative 20400 pI have been working on this for a while and I cant seem to figure it out.

I will provide the url of my test site if you want to see for yourself what it is suppose to be doing. First click California and then close the modal window with the X in the corner then try another state and you will see that the close button does not work.

Negative 20400 pI have an ARM processor that is able to interface with an external flash memory chip. Written to the chip are programs compiled for the ARM architecture ready to be executed. What I need to know how to do is get this data from the external flash onto the ARM processor for execution.p  pCan I run some sort of copy routine aheadoftime where the data is copied into executable memory space I suppose I could, but the ARM processor is running an operating system and I dont have a ton of space left over in flash to work with. Id also like to be able to schedule the execution of two or even three programs at once, and copying multiple programs into internal flash at one time isnt feasible. The operating system can be used to launch the programs once theyre within accessible memory space, so anything that needs to be done beforehand can be.p

Negative 20400 pI have a Google App Engine servlet that is codecroncode configured to run once a week. Since it will take more than 1 minute of execution time, it launches a task i.e. another servlet codetaskclearcode on the applications default push task queue.p  pNow what Im observing is this if the task causes an exception e.g. codeNullPointerExceptioncode inside its second servlet, this gets translated into HTTP status 500 i.e. codeHttpURLConnection.HTTPINTERNALERRORcode and Google App Engine apparently reacts by immediately relaunching the same task again. It announces this by printingp  precodeWeb hook at http127.0.0.18888taskclear returned status code 500.  Rescheduling.. codepre  pI can see how this can sometimes be a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1027778googleappenginetaskqueuesvscronjobsfeaturea, but in my scenario its inappropriate. Can I request that Google App Engine should not do such automatic rescheduling, or am I expected to use other status codes to indicate error conditions that would not cause rescheduling by its rules Or is this something that happens only on the dev. server p  pBTW, I am currently also running other tasks with different frequencies on the same task queue, so throttling reschedules on the level of task queue configuration would be inconvenient so I hope there is anotherbetter option too.p

Negative 20400 pAfternoon SA,p  pIve got a bit of an issue. Actually its more of an inconvenience than a bug.p  pWe are currently using MS Entity Framework with MySQL for VS2012 available here a hrefhttpwww.mysql.comwhymysqlwindowsvisualstudio relnofollowMySQL for Visual Studioa. The problem is that when we perform an insert using EF, it adds trailing whitespace characters to any entry less than the field size.p  pSo if we insert test1 into a field that is varchar10, we end up with 5 whitespaces added to the end. Then when we try to query this in other software, we end up not being able to find test1 because it has 5 extra whitespace characters.p  pChanging the software that uses this is impossible, otherwise it would be incredibly easy to just fix and trim the result. Is there any way to force EF with MySQL to only insert test1 without the whitespace Or will I have to run a manual trim query every time someone inserts into the MySQL databasep  pThanks, Ep

At the very least, codesigning artifacts such as code.pfxcode files would need to be stripped out as these would allow malicious individuals to publish new versions of the app to the Windows Store under my account by masquerading as me.p  pDoes anybody have a definitive list of what files within a Windows Store apps Visual Studio solution are not safe to make public in this way Are there parts of the code.slncode or code.csprojcode files I should strip out of the project As with any private information, this would all need to be removed from the repository and its history.p

Negative 20400 pId like to define elegant interfaces for a binary relation and for a transitive relation. I consider a binary relation as a set of pairs, a subset of some set X  Y. In fact I intend to work mainly with transitive relations, but I occasionally need general binary relations. This is mainly for my own usage but I may endup publishing this as a FLOSS library for other users. I would like my definitions to make sense on a general level as I do not have yet precise requirements about usage of these classes I need them for experimental work related to scientific research, I have some ideas right now but it is unclear yet what kind of experiments I will need as more ideas come while doing the research.p  h2General ideah2  pThe core of what I think I need is as follows.p  precode   param ltFgt              the type used for the from elements.   param ltTgt              the type used for the to elements.      public interface BinaryRelationTentativeltF, Tgt             return a view of the domain of this relation all the elements x such that for some y, x, y is in the               relation.           public SetltFgt getFromSet             return a view of the range of this relation all the elements y such that for some x, x, y is in the relation.           public SetltTgt getToSet             return the number of pairs that this relation contains.           public int size             return ltcodegttrueltcodegt iff the relation has empty from and to sets.           public boolean isEmpty             A binary relation equals an other one iff they have equal from and to sets and for each x, y contained in one,       x, y is contained in the other one.           Override     public boolean equalsObject obj             return whether the given ltcodegtfromltcodegt element is in relation with the ltcodegttoltcodegt element.           public boolean containsF from, T to             Optional operation.           public boolean addF from, T to  codepre  pThis is only the core features, so that you see what I mean  nicer features for traversal and so on would be welcome, see below. Then I would define a codeTransitiveRelationltEgtcode that extends codeBinaryRelationltE, Egtcode, that does not implement codeaddcode but rather provides codeaddTransitiveF from, T tocode.p  h2Reusing classical collectionsh2  pNow of course, I want to reuse classical collection interfaces as much as possible. It seems Guavas codeSetMultimapcode a hrefhttpdocs.guavalibraries.googlecode.comgitjavadoccomgooglecommoncollectSetMultimap.html relnofollowjavadoca, a hrefhttpcode.google.compguavalibrarieswikiNewCollectionTypesExplainedMultimap relnofollowuser guidea has the core features I need and more. The user guide even mentions the use case of an unlabeled directed graph. One problem I see with using directly codeSetMultimapcode is that the terminology is not exactly right speaking of keys and values in case of a binary relation is strange. Moreover, it misses something. There is an asymetry that makes sense in a SetMultimap designed to go from key to values, that makes less sense in a binary relation. The SetMultimap has an interface and implementations that allows one to, given a from element, iterate efficiently i.e. without traversing the whole relation through the to elements in relation to it. Similarly, I would like to be able to, having a to element, iterate over the corresponding from elements efficiently. So I need something that could be called a BiSetMultimap corresponding to both a codeMapltK, SetltVgtgtcode and a codeMapltV, SetltKgtgtcode. I have not been able to find such thing in the Java world.p  pI am currently, thus, thinking about defining codeBinaryRelationltF, Tgtcode as a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFacadepattern relnofollowfacadea to codeSetMultimapltF, Tgtcode. I can then create betternamed methods in the interface conceptually equivalent to the methods in codeSetMultimapcode, and I can add a method codegetInverselyRelatedT to SetltFgtcode that gives the from elements. I could provide implementations based on two codeSetMultimapcodes kept in sync, one representing the relation and one representing its inverse.p  pTheres numerous alternative approaches to this problem. I could for example define codeBinaryRelationcode as extending codeSetMultimapcode. Or I could avoid hiding completely codeSetMultimapcode and provide access to it through codeBinaryRelationasSetMultimapcode. That way I get all their nice method interfaces. Or I could give up entirely the idea of a specific interface and use a codeSetMultimapcode instead of a codeBinaryRelationcode, considering then the reversetraversal operation as an optimisation feature available in specific classes but not on the interface level. Or I could perhaps use something else than SetMultimap as a basis for the design.p  pTherefore, my question finally what do you think about my approach Can you think about other approaches Some problems I overlooked An existing solution I could usep  h2Possible linksh2  pI thought about using some Graph library a hrefhttpjung.sourceforge.net relnofollowJUNGa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comjgraphtjgrapht relnofollowJGraphTa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comtinkerpopblueprintswiki relnofollowBlueprinta, but I do not think they fit my needs. All these have an codeEdgecode class or an Edge type parameter which adds complexity and none provide interfaces and implementations as nice as codeSetMultimapcode, in my humble opinion. a hrefhttpwww.i3s.unice.frhogiegrph relnofollowGrpha does not provide objects for vertices, as the a hrefhttpwww.i3s.unice.frhogiegrphpageDocumentation relnofollowuser manuala says. I may have missed something though so tell me if you disagree.p  pEdit. As mentioned by Xaerxess, this guava a hrefhttpscode.google.compguavalibrariesissuesdetailid394 relnofollowissuea suggests to add what I call here a BiSetMultimap to Guava.p

Negative 20400 pSay you have a nongeneric Foo and generic class Foo. In the nongeneric class you have a member variable that is of type nongeneric FooBar and likewise you have a member variable in the generic class that is of type FooBar.p  precodepublic class Foo     protected FooBar SomeVar     public void DoSomething             Manipulate SomeVar here        public class FooltTgt Foo where T SomeObject    protected new FooBarltTgt SomeVar  codepre  pAlso FooBar is derived from FooBar which isnt shown in the code.p  pSay there is a method in the nongeneric class which does some data manipulation with the member variable SomeVar.  Now the issue is that if the generic class Foo is instantiated, the method that is implemented in the nongeneric class only has reference to the nongeneric SomeVar and doesnt have any knowledge about the generic variable.  p  pNow it seems the only way around this is to override the DoSomething method in the generic class which would allow it to know about the generic variable.p  pI guess the issue with this approach is that the logic is kind of duplicated from the nongeneric to generic class. Is there any alternatives to this issuep  pUpdated I have updated the classes to be more inline with my problemp  precodepublic abstract class BaseObject      Abstract class that handles how the object is loaded when querying database for an object   public class Name  BaseObject     public string FirstName getset     public string LastName getset     public Date DOB getset   public interface IData     Listltstringgt SearchFields    string timestamp    Search search  Search is a class that will query the database for a given object and because this is a non generic version, itll bring back a list of base object   public interface IDataltTgt  IData, where T BaseObject     SearchltTgt search  Bring back a list of ltTgt   public class BrowseData IData     Search search    public class BrowseDataltTgt BrowseData, IDataltTgt where T BaseObject     SearchltTgt search   public class BrowseBuilder     protected BrowseData Data    public BrowseBuilderBrowseData data           Data  data         public void DoRender             Using the data provided does the rendering       public class BrowseBuilderltTgt BrowseBuilder where T BaseObject     protected new BrowseDataltTgt Data    public BrowseBuilderBrowseDataltTgt data           Data  data      codepre  pMy issue is that method DoRender implemented in nongeneric class BrowseBuilder, which is using the nongeneric datasearch to do the rendering which would return a list of baseObject whereas the generic version would return a list of T. p  pMaybe Im looking at this wrong and the search should be nongeneric regardless and the base method that manipulate it should just return the list of baseObject instead.p

Looping through the WCF service calls is very slow. It takes many seconds to loop through them. I tried switching from wsHttpBinding to netTcpBinding, and playing with the serviceThrottling in WCF.p  pWCF isnt compulsory, but it seems like a separate event handling project on the publisher end would be beneficial and could be physically located elsewhere from the MVC app load reduction etc.. Is WCF plausible for a situation like this, or should I try using Windows services or some other selfhosted e.g. console app etc, or potentially using a thread in MVC to generate the event data, or are there better scenarios What are the best practices in this type of Event handling system Basically it seems like it would be beneficial to have something generating the Event data since it has to be handled somewhere while not slowing down the UI that the end user is using.p

I am still unable to find a right way to do it.p  pSo I have just strongone activitystrong in my App, and strong6 fragmentsstrong. First one is a codeListFragmentcode which loads a list from a SQLite table. When user taps on a row in this list, I do 2 things p  p1 Get an strongintstrong from that row through a listener, and pass it back to the parent activity which stores it as a class variable using a simple setter method.br 2 Replace this codeListFragmentcode with another simple codeFragmentcode. This new Fragment uses a simple stronggetterstrong on that class variable to retrieve some information from a different table, and show all the details to the user.p  pSo far so good. Now if I am on this details Fragment, and I change the screen orientation, the activity state is not reloaded as I am checking if codesavedInstanceStatecode is strongnullstrong in the codeonCreatecode, but however, the class variables lose their value, and my app crashes. p  pBasically I am trying to pass data from the ListFragment to the details Fragment. I am doing it through the activity, which is causing a problem. As per Android Documentation p  blockquote   pAll FragmenttoFragment communication is done through the associated   Activity. Two Fragments should never communicate directly.p blockquote  pThere is no specific code which is giving me trouble, so didnt post any. p

When assigning a Pandas object e.g. a DataFrame to a slice of a DataFrame e.g. returned by .loc as above, Pandas attempts to align the indices of the two.  That is, it assigns the rows on the RHS to rows on the LHS by their Pandas index.  p  pIn my case above, the RHS has a simple integer sequential index  row numbers, and the LHS index is a subset of the selected row numbers from df  i.e. df also has a sequential integer index, of which the slice selects a subset.  For rows on the LHS for which there is no matching index on the RHS, Pandas assigns NA.p  pThe elegant solution is to have both df and common indexed by the content of the key column instead.  Then the assignment will do as planned  assign rows from the RHS to the LHS based on value of the key.  This is both more natural and avoids needing to presort or subset.p  pThe reason the answer of ctzhu works is that accessing the .values attribute of the RHS returns a Numpy array, which has no notion of a Pandastyle index.  When Pandas receives such an object on the RHS, it does the assignment without trying to align indices  which works since my example prearranged for the two to be in the same order via sortingp

Negative 20400 pI have been melting my brain trying to work out the formula i need for a multiple conditional lookup.p  pI have two data sets, one is job data and the other is contract data. The job data contains customer name, location of job and date of job.  I need to find out if the job was contracted when it took place, and if it was return a value from column N in the contract data.p  pThe problem comes when i try to use the date ranges, as there are frequently more than one contract per customer.p  pSo for example, in my job datap  pCUSTOMER       LOCATION         JOB DATEp  pCust A          Port A          01012014p  pCust A          Port B          01022014p  pCustomer A had a contract in port B that expired on 21st Feb 2014, so here i would want it to return the value from column N in my contract data as the job was under contract. Customer A did not have a contract in port A at the time of the job, so i would want it to return no contract.p  pContract data has columns containing customer name, port name, and a start and end date value, as well as my lookup category.p  pI think i need to be using index  match but i cant seem to get them to work with my date ranges.  Is there another type of lookup i can use to get this to workp  pPlease help, Im losing the plot p  pThanks p

Negative 20400 pI use Raspberry PI to develop network application. I found problem when I connect PI with adhoc network. When PI connect to adhoc network PI cant ping any device. However, if I ping from other device to PI before, PI can store the path to that device and PI can ping that device. I send ping from PI to IP broadcast 192.168.1.255 in network 192.168.1.024 and I use wireshark to capture packets. I dont see icmp packet came out from PI.

Negative 20400 pI am new to ObjectiveC, but have some programming knowledge. So I followed Todd Perkins tutorial on making a notes application on Lynda.com. To get more familiar with ObjectiveC, I am wanting to add things to this notes app to learn more, but Im kind of stuck. p  pCurrently, the notes app is built in a Master Detail application template. So there is a Table View in the MasterDetailView controller, and a detail view in the DetailViewController. When a user taps the add button, it segues to the Detail controller and there is a UITextField that you type into and when you click Back, it saves that UITextField to NSUserDefaults, and thats what is used to populate the cell in the Table View.p  pSo basically, what I have done is add a UITextView for another spot in the Detail View. But I cant figure out the best way to save that the same way the title of the note is saved. Obviously, each one needs to be different for each note.

How can I pass custom message to JSPpage from LoginModule  The only way that I see is to store this message in session and retrieve it on JSPpage. But I dont know how to get session in LoginModule.

The way I send my packets is by doing this codenew ClientLoginPacketusername, password.sendcode. I the ClientLoginPacket class you can see that is runs Networking.sentTCPthis to send the packet. This just runs this code in my main kryonet class codeNetworking.javacode. Here is the code it uses to send packets on the client sidep  precodepublic static void sendTCPPacket object     client.sendTCPobject  codepre  pIn kryonet, you have to register classes before sending them.

What would my issue be Is there something wrong with my class registration Do both classes have to be completely identical Thanks in advancep  pp.s. sorry for throwing all that code out. I wouldnt normally do this if I didnt have to. I put the least as possible. If you need more to see how the other stuff works and to see if the issue is there, just ask me. Thanksp

The main issue is there are several places that call this all of which pass in the productId, so changing that would not be feasible.  p  precodevoid AssignFunctionsint productId      switch productId              case 31             IsSpread  CalendarIsSpread             IsLeftPage  CalendarIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break         case 49         case 63         case 64         case 69         case 70         ...         case 592          case 630          case 686              IsSpread  NeverASpread             IsLeftPage  GeneralIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break         case 73             IsSpread  GeneralIsSpread             IsLeftPage  GeneralIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break         case 444         case 445             IsSpread  BookletIsSpread             IsLeftPage  BookletLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  BookletGetOppositePageNumber             break         default             IsSpread  GeneralIsSpread             IsLeftPage  GeneralIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break       codepre  pAnother scenario would be to take the productId and compare it to the text file and then act accordingly. In that case the call would look something like thisp  precodevoid AssignFunctionsint productId      Do Something here to get the productSpreadType      switch productSpreadType              case 1             IsSpread  CalendarIsSpread             IsLeftPage  CalendarIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break         case 2             IsSpread  NeverASpread             IsLeftPage  GeneralIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break         case 3             IsSpread  GeneralIsSpread             IsLeftPage  GeneralIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break         case 4             IsSpread  BookletIsSpread             IsLeftPage  BookletLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  BookletGetOppositePageNumber             break         default             IsSpread  GeneralIsSpread             IsLeftPage  GeneralIsLeftPage             GetOppositePageNumber  GeneralGetOppositePageNumber             break       codepre  pIn this case the text file would look something like thisp  precode31 1 49 2 63 2 ... 73 3 444 4 codepre  pIf the productId is not listed it would just then perform the default action.p  p.NET is not my forte and it takes a good half day every time we add new products to remember how to update this. As I am the only one with Visual Studio running on Windows the task always fall to me. With the exception of having to make this change we dont have to touch the code base, so it would be nice to not have to build the DLLs every time and be able to pass the task of making sure this gets updated to one of our junior developers, who make are the ones responsible for adding new products.p

This is probably due to the view being null always p  pI am basically wanting the item selected to be changed and not affect other items in the list and when scrolling, the item that was changed should be remembered.p  precodepublic View getViewint pos, View view, ViewGroup viewgroup      View row  null     view  null     row  view     ifview  null         row    layoutInflater.inflateR.layout.layoutlist, viewgroup, false     row.setPadding0, 10, 0, 10     listText       MusicTextViewrow.findViewByIdR.id.listLabels     listText.setTypefaceTypeface.createFromAsset                                                     context.getAssets,                                                     fontsRobotoLight.ttf     return row  codepre

However, given that the full suite can be huge, it would make life much easier if Associated Regression Tests can be quickly identified and run while making the changes.

Negative 20400 pI am a college Computer Science student and I have been trying to understand the stlvector on a deeper level. I found out, vector are in fact dynamic arrays, meaning upon insertiondeletion, if needed, the array is resized.p  pA friend told me, when the arrays reallocated, for example upon insertion, instead of creating a new array of size [original1], it creates a new array of a size [2original].p  pWouldnt it be better to only add or substract one array field when you insertdelete something, instead of creating an array twice as large, leaving many indexes unusedp  pI thought the reason for this is, that perhaps creating an array twice as large, or reallocatin the array, only every once in a while rather than on every insertiondeletion has much better time complexcity, but for example, if I had an array of large objects, would it even then be still better to reallocate an array twice the size of original, or use size1p  pThank you for responses.p

Negative 20400 pIm stuck on the following problem and can not find what Im doing wrong. My problem is to replace the default editor of a cell of a JTable and use a ComboBox instead.

Id do something like thisp  precodetest       1    What is 11nA 2nB 11nC 1nD None of the above.nn, A     2    What is 22nA 2nB 4nC 1nD None of the above.nn, B     3    What is 33nA 2nB 11nC 6nD None of the above.nn, C     4    What is 44nA 2nB 11nC 1nD None of the above.nn, D     5    What is 55nA 2nB 11nC 10nD None of the above.nn, C     6    What is 66nA 2nB 12nC 1nD None of the above.nn, B       answer  rawinputtest[1] codepre  pWhich I could use to easily print out questions either in order or randomly with a little modification. However, I have no way of actually attaching the correct answer to the dictionary which means Id have to do something like make ridiculous amounts of codeifcode statements. Does anyone know a solution Is there a way to add a 3rd value to each dictionary entry A workaround Im completely overlooking Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 20400 pBelow Ive appended the vardump of an array that Ive created through useractions involving an HTML form. p  pIm certainly willing to consider other strategies for achieving the final effect and Im not, to be honest, positive that it would not be better achieved via WordPress functions, since thats the environment this problem originates in, but the simplest answer would be to take the array described below, get rid of the NULL responses, then alphabetize ALL of the remaining sets by last name which I originally put first since in an earlier, similar version of the same task it happened to make the final sort a snap. p  pThe output will appear on a signin list at an event, with first column numbered, second column showing first name  last name with company underneath, a signature line, a line describing the ticket type, and the ticket price. p  pSO, just to make it easy to picturep  pNo. FIRSTLASTcompany        SIGNATURE     TICKET TYPE   PRICEp  p Amy Abrams, Carolco       .........

Thinkp  precodeformhelper datamodel   formfield datakeyname   formfield datakeystreet   formfield datakeycity formhelper codepre  pGeneralized Ive got two components that are meant to work together in a nested way. The outer one provides some environment that is consumed by the inner one. a hrefhttpalexspeller.comsimpleformswithember relnofollowhttpalexspeller.comsimpleformswithembera has this explained in some more detail and uses the inner components parentView to access the outer context. Great.p  pNow, ember components are meant to fill in for web components as long as they arent ready for prime time, but from what I understand web components are meant to be encapsulated. The only way to exchange information are data binding and events. p  pIf this is correct and ember strives to replace its own components with web components, would this solution be future proof. Can I rely on ember delivering some kind of parentView access after the switch to real web componentsp  pIf not, what would be the right, the ember way to do this A component outside and view helpers inside Some usage of binding and events that I am currently unaware of p  pI know Ive got a solution for now, but Im developing a solution that will be in use for quite a long time, so I want to avoid anything thats essentially deprecated at the time of writing my code.p

If you only have 30 frames or so it manages to complete the video file, but more than that it starts executing the rest of the script before the video.mp4 file has actually be fully created.p  pI found this behavior to be rather strange because the codesystemcode command is supposed to wait until whatever it runs has finished executing.

Unfortunately, it seems I dont have the permissions to create even temporary functions, so Im wondering strongis it possible to do a while loop to calculate the time within a Select statementstrong Ive tried to do this, but the code validator says its invalid.p  pSorry I dont have any code to help explain what Im trying to do at the moment, as Im away from my work PC, but eventually Id like something like thisp  precodeCreated           Resolved          Time Taken  Priority  Worker 01012015 1200  01012015 1300  010000    A         C Forbes 02032015 2000  03032015 1100  030000    B         J Flansburgh 31052015 1850  01052015 1050  001000    D         E Idle 14042015 2000  16042015 1000  140000    D         A Ng codepre  pemC Forbes  Standard job  datediff would work hereemp  pemJ Flansburgh  Worker finishes at 2100 weekdays, and starts at 0900, so 1 hour on day 1  2 hours on day 2  3 hours totalemp  pemE Idle  Finishes at 1900 on Sundays, and finished the job before she was officially supposed to start on Monday. 10 minutes on Sunday the 31st, 0 minutes on Monday the 1st  10 minutesemp  pemA Ng Finishes at 2100 weekdays, and starts at 0900... 1 hour on the 14th12 hours on the 15th1 hour on the 16th  14 hours totalemp  pAnother idea Ive had while typing this question out is to do a while loop, taking one line at a time out of a table, working out the time from that individual line, then appending each line to a new table.

How tough is a program like this Is it something I can do by myself in a reasonable time or should I outsource itp  pThank you all in advance for the helpp  pEDIT  Also, this is what I perceive the pseudo code to look like.p  precodeRUN Load Webpage Search Page IF match found alert user ELSE load next page IF last page go to first page and start again codepre

Negative 20400 pI have a DropwizardAngularJS website.

However, I just tried it, and everything on service is returning a 404.

Negative 20400 pThe DLL was originally written in D2007 and needed a quick, panic TStringList call yes, it was one of those Im sure to regret though all the calls to the DLL, made by several modules, are all made by Delphi code and I wrongly presumedhoped backwards compatibility when XE came out.p  pSo now Im moving the DLL to XE5 amp thus Unicode and must maintain the call for compatibility. The worst case is I simply write a new DLL only for XE while keeping the old one for legacy, but feel there should be no reason why XE couldnt deconstructoverrride to an ANSI TStringList parameter.  But my Delphi behindthescenes knowledge is not robust and a couple of attempts have not succeeded. p  pHere is the DLL call  it takes a list of file paths and in this strippeddown code, simply adds each string to an internal list that is all the DLL does with the parameter, a single readonly referencep  precodefunction ViewFileList  lstPaths TStringList Integer Export Stdcall begin       for iCount  0 to lstPaths.Count  1 do          lstInternal.AddlstPaths.strings[iCount] end codepre  pWhat I found is that when I compiled this in XE5, that lstPaths.Count is correct, so the basic structure aligns.  But the strings were garbage.  It seems the mismatch would be twofold a the string content naturally is being interpreted as twobytes per character b there is no Element size at position 10 and code page at position 12 so yes, garbage strings.  I am also vaguely aware of behindthescenes memory management, though I only do readonly access.  But the actual string pointers themselves should be correct  and thus is there a way to coerce my way throughp  pSo, regardless of whether I have any of that right, is there any solution  Thanks in advance. p

If we consider the date range 20140101 to 20140110, I would want it to count 7p  pMy only thought was to brute force create a separate dataframe with every date note that this is 4 years of dates which would be an immense undertaking and then merging the two dataframes and counting the number of NA values.

Negative 20400 pI am writing a GUI application that has to connect to a database I am using MySQL.  When the user clicks the button to get the data, the GUI class creates a new thread which executes the proper query.  However, obviously problems could happen one of them is a failed DriverManager.getConnection. When it fails, JDBC stays stuck for possibly many seconds. The user may want to change something in order to solve this problem, and then try to reconnect. I would like to make the user click on a button to cancel the operation.  However, I cant find a way to do it properly. Calling cancel on the thread does not solve the problem database connection is a blocking IO operation. p  pI already read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1704518interruptcancelastuckconnectcallthis questiona, but the way it solves the problem is quite different from the solution I am looking for. It uses a timer the time interval has to be preset and it could be too short or too long for the user. Another approach could be just ignoring the stuck thread, and starting a new one. However, I do not find it to be particularly cleanfor example, for concurrency problems the thread that has to retry the operation may have to wait for the stuck thread to complete.  In general, the user may want to stop the network operation, and I think it is important to allow this possibility.p  pWhat do you think about this Do you have any suggestion about a possible solutionp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 20400 pI have a code Ive implemented as tcpip clientserver. Basically, I need processA to send data JSON format to processB on another computer, wait for it to be processed and then read the response send by processB. Ive implemented it as a simple client processA and server processB.p  pThis code is now being put into production system, and the contractors working on it want to implement the whole thing as a webservice and use JMS. They threw in a few other acronyms SOAP, REST etc in our meeting. Does this have any merit Does it make the code more maintainablep  pThough Im not knowledgeable in JMS and webservices, it seems counterintuitive to me that adding additional dependencies helps in any way  especially when it is a single process communicating with another process on a different computer in our office LAN.p

Negative 20400 pI was reading this tutorial on building a simple virtual machinebytecode interpreter.

Negative 20400 pI have a script that used to work and add multiple files to a Winrar archive, test the archive, then delete the original files.  It worked great, then I broke it, and now cannot fix. problem now is that for each file I am adding to the archive, a new Winrar window pops up and tells me that a file is in use by another process.p  pThe powershell here is likely fine, but I think im doing something wrong with the rar command andor the paths.p  pthanks in advance for any suggestions.p  precode    setalias rar cProgram FilesWinRARWinRAR.exe startdate  getdate7202015 0000 enddate  getdate7212015 0000 path  DTFS.Backup files  GetChildItem path  WhereObject .creationtime gt startdate and .creationtime lt enddate filedate  startdate.day fileyear  startdate.year filemonth  startdate.month rarname  fileyearfilemonthfiledate.rar destination  patharchive foreach file in files rar  a r m3 t df mt4 destinationrarname pathfile codepre
Negative 20400 pi want to fetch an array of string like this codes123456codebr i put the data into buffer so the data can be parsedprocessed. so the data must contain a  in the first buffer index and a  in the last buffer index to be processed.br if that symbol found, send some respond to terminal, like respond k. when i tested the code in realterm, the result still had some error.br i get confused where to put the BufferWrite function when i use ISR.br heres my codep  precodeinclude ltinttypes.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltavrio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltavrinterrupt.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltutildelay.hgt include ltutilatomic.hgt include ltstring.hgt  define BUFFSIZE 8 define USARTBAUDRATE 9600 define UBRRVALUE FCPU  USARTBAUDRATE  16UL  1 define USARTBAUDRATE 9600 define BAUDPRESCALE FCPU  USARTBAUDRATE  16UL  1  volatile char datas[BUFFSIZE]  volatile int index volatile int i volatile uint8t flaguart  0 void USART0Initvoid       set berhasil     UCSRB  1 ltlt RXEN  1 ltlt TXEN  1 ltlt RXCIE     UCSRC  1 ltlt URSEL  1 ltlt UCSZ1  1 ltlt UCSZ0      UBRRH  uint8t UBRRVALUE gtgt 8     UBRRL  uint8t UBRRVALUE      Set frame format to 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit     UCSRC  1 ltlt UCSZ1  1 ltlt UCSZ0     enable reception and RC complete interrupt    void indexing       index  0     i  0  int BufferWrite      datas[i]  UDR     if i lt BUFFSIZE       datas[i]  UDR     i  index     datas[i]  increment      return 0  else      ifdatas[0]    datas[7]       UDR  datas[i]     UDR  k     i  0 reset     return 0          return 1   int main void      USART0Init     indexing     BufferWrite     sei  Enable the Global Interrupt Enable flag so that interrupts can be processed     BufferInitampbuf      for   Loop forever              if flaguart  1          flaguart  0         datas[i]  UDR a itu receive         BufferWrite         ISRUSARTRXCvect  BufferWrite flaguart  1    datas[i]  UDR     Fetch the received byte value into the variable data. u     UDR  datas[i]    UDR  data  Echo back the received byte back to the computer   codepre

Negative 20400 pIn the following code, we pass two arrays to a subroutine and do some additional operations inside DO loops. Here, we consider three cases where different operations are made Case 1  no operation, Cases 2 and 3  assignment of pointer variables.p  precode module mymod     implicit none     integer, pointer  nmod     integer  nloop contains  ......................................................... subroutine test2dim  a, b, n      integer  n     real  an,n, bn,n      integer, pointer  nptr     integer i1, i2, iloop      nptr gt nmod      do iloop  1, nloop          do i2  1, n         do i1  1, n             bi1,i2  ai1,i2  bi1,i2  iloop               nothing here     Case 1  gfort gt 3.6 sec, ifort gt 3.2 sec             nptr  n           Case 2  gfort gt 15.9 sec, ifort gt 6.2 sec             nptr  nmod       Case 3  gfort gt 3.6 sec, ifort gt 3.5 sec         enddo         enddo      enddo endsubroutine  endmodule   program main     use mymod     implicit none     integer, target  n     real, allocatable  a,, b,      nloop  10000  n  1000     allocate a n, n , b n, n       a  0.0  b  0.0      nmod gt n      call test2dim  a, b, n       print , an,n, bn,n    for check end codepre  pHere, we note that this pointer is linked to the upper bounds of the DO loop via the module variable nmod. Thus, changing the pointer variables inside the loop should affect the behavior of the loops. But please note that we do not change the bounds in practice just a copy of variable. gfortran 4.8 and ifort 14.0 with O3 gave the timing listed above. Notably, Case 2 is very slow as compared to Case 1, despite that the net calculation seems not much different. I suspected that this might be because the compiler cannot determine whether the upper bound of the second loop for i1 is changed by pointer assignment, so avoiding aggressive optimization. To verify this, I tested the following routine in place of test2dimp  precodesubroutine test1dim  a, b, n      integer  n     real  an  n, bn  n      integer, pointer  nptr     integer iloop, i      nptr gt nmod      do iloop  1, nloop          do i  1, n  n              b i   a i   b i   iloop                nothing here     Case 1  gfort gt 3.6 sec, ifort gt 2.3 sec               nptr  n          Case 2  gfort gt 15.9 sec, ifort gt 6.0 sec               nptr  nmod      Case 3  gfort gt 3.6 sec, ifort gt 6.1 sec         enddo      enddo endsubroutine codepre  pHere the sole difference between test1dim and test2dim is that the arrays a and b are accessed by 1 or 2dim indices essentially no difference in the amount of calculation. Surprisingly, Case 2 also gave a slow result, even though there is only a single DO loop. Because Fortran DO loops determine the upper bound of the loop upon entry a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32166126upperboundsoffortrandoloops[Ref]a, I expected that test1dim would not be affected by pointer assignment, though this was not the case. So, is there any reasonable explanation for this behavior I hope that I am not making some big mistake that leads to this time difference.p  hr  pMy motivation for this question I have been using derived types extensively to specify multidimensional loops, for examplep  precodemodule Gridmod type Gridt     integer  N1, N2, N3 endtype ....  subroutine somecalc  vector, grid  typeGridt  grid .... do i3  1, grid  N3 do i2  1, grid  N2 do i1  1, grid  N1     ... various operations... enddo enddo enddo codepre  pUp to now, I have not been paying much attention to whether Gridt objects are given TARGET or POINTER attribute assuming that it will have essentially no effect on the performance. However, I now think that this might lead to some performance drop if a compiler cannot determine whether the upper bounds are constant inside the loops though I will emneverem change the bounds in actual codes. So I would appreciate for any advice whether I should be more careful against using TARGET or POINTER attributes for bound variables including derivedtype components, as given by the grid object above.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFollowing the suggestion by francescalus, I have tried attaching intentin, value to the dummy argument n. The result is as followp  precodetest1dim     Case 1 gfort gt 3.6 s, ifort gt 2.3 s     Case 2 gfort gt 3.6 s, ifort gt 3.1 s     Case 3 gfort gt 3.6 s, ifort gt 3.4 s   test2dim     Case 1 gfort gt 3.7 s, ifort gt 3.1 s     Case 2 gfort gt 3.7 s, ifort gt 3.1 s     Case 3 gfort gt 3.7 s, ifort gt 6.4 s codepre  pWhile ifort gives somewhat irregular result 6.4 s for Case 3 in test2dim, all the other results show essentially the best performance. This strongly suggests that the treatment of bounds by the compiler does affect the performance not due to the cost of pointer assignment. Because it seems important to tell the compiler that bounds are constant, I also tried copying the dummy argument n here, not with intentin, value to a local variable n and use it as loop boundsp  precode  integer  n     dummy argument   integer  n    a local variable   ...   n  n    do i2  1, n   do i1  1, n       bi1,i2  ai1,i2  bi1,i2  iloop       ... codepre  pThe result for test2dim is as followsp  precodetest2dim     Case 1 gfort gt 3.6 s, ifort gt 3.1 s     Case 2 gfort gt 15.9 s, ifort gt 6.2 s     Case 3 gfort gt 3.7 s, ifort gt 6.4 s codepre  pHere unfortunately and in contrast to my expectation, Case 2 did not improve at all... Though the copying to a local n should guarantee that n is constant in the DO loops, the compiler seems not happy because the array shape is still determined by n, not by n, thus still avoiding aggressive optimization lt just my guess.p  hr  pstrongUpdate2strongp  pFollowing the suggestion by innoSPG, I also changed n to n inside DO loops for Case 2, and then it turns out that the code runs as fast as Case 1 Specifically, the code isp  precode  n  n    do i2  1, n   do i1  1, n       bi1,i2  ai1,i2  bi1,i2  iloop        nptr  n           Case 2  gfort gt 3.7 sec, ifort gt 3.1 sec codepre  pBut as the Answer suggests, this efficiency may be because the assignment statement is totally eliminated by the compiler. So I think I need to consider more practical codes not too simple ones to test the impact of pointers or pointer components on loop optimization...p  p...I am sorry for a very long question...p

Negative 20400 pSo, I need to run multiple php appssites on one server. One or many should run using apache and modphp5, and one or many should be able to run using modfastcgi and phpfpm.

Negative 20400 pI will be hosting my Cassandra database on Google cloud. Instances are priced in a linear fashion meaning 1cpu with 2gb ram is 1, 2cpu with 4gb is 2, 4cpu with 8GB is 4 and so on. p  pI am deciding on the size of my instances and am not sure what the standard is I was thinking of using more fewer larger instances 8cpu, 64gb opposed to lighter such as 2cpu, 4 gb. My thought process is with more instances each node will carry less of the overall data which would have a smaller impact if nodes fail. As well, the os of these smaller instances would have less overhead because it would accept less connections. p  pThese are pros, but here are some cons I can think of 1 Each instance will be less utilized 2 Cassandra  JVM overhead on so many instances can add up and be a lot of overhead. 3 I will be using local SSD opposed to persistent SSD which are much more expensive meaning each instance will need their own local SSD which raises costs.p  pThese are some reasons I can think of, is there any other proscons between choosing more smaller instances vs fewer larger for a Cassandra database maybe even nodes in general Are there any best practices associated to choosing Cassandra server sizesp  pPS I added the Java tag because Cassandra is built using JAVA and runs on the JVM and would like to see if the JVM has any proscons.p

Negative 20400 pI know we can not write any socket programming using normal java script as those are the client side codes. It is possible to create server that bind to a port using node. js. But I do not need those. One of my complex requirement is that I have java http server running in  my machine which bind to a port number 7878. When the java server is started, I want the client code which is running in my browser should get notify that the server is started.  Is it practically possible  Or is it possible for node. js or any js framework which will be running in the client side code and listens to the port number 7878.and when the java server is started it will get notified.

Negative 20400 pI am just getting into an android project that someone else already worked on. I am currently just correcting UI issues and such, and we decided we needed bigger sizes of some graphics that look blurry on tablet size. So we decided to make a few sizedependent folders. Until now, former guy has placed a lot of graphics into the mipmap folder because it automatically selects images based on density. But now i read that mipmap is only for the launcher icon.  Now my dilemma is whether I should move the graphics or not. It wouldnt be too hard to do, but i tried with a few, and I noticed that when taken out of the mipmap folder, and placed inside the drawables folder, the graphics are suddenly bigger. This means that I either have to resize every single graphic, or replace the file with a smaller version. I am tempted to leave well enough alone, and not invoke all sorts of redesign processes for the sake of keeping the structure tidy. But on the other hand, it kinda hurts not to.p  pDoes anyone know what I should do, or if mipmap is ok to use for graphics that arent the launcher icon And if I am to move it, how do I best tackle all these problemsp

The Facebook docs mentioned that the ShareDialog.show will fallback to web dialog in case native Facebook app is not installed.

Negative 20400 pDoes anybody have any idea how to add a codepostprocessoutboundcode filter to Restlet p  pThere seems to be a bug in the Restlet system that sets the codeAccessControlAllowOrigin  code regardless of what I set it to in the inbound codeCorsFiltercode. I dont quite understand why but the best solution I can come up with at this time is to set a filter that is executed after whatever code in Restlet is reseting that value.p  pHowever I dont seem to be having much luck. I assume I should be working with the following...p  precodeOverride public Restlet createOutboundRoot     ...  codepre  pHowever I currently am struggling to get anything I place in there to execute.p

Negative 20400 pI have a hexadecimal address that I want to encode into a raw string. I am following a tutorial on buffer overflow attack and this string will encode my attack string and return address. The problem is this Whenever I encode hex value code0x8877a377code into string and read it into my executable, when I check the return address using gdb, I always see and extra literal next to a3. My address looks like this in gdb p  precode0x77a3c277  0x00000088 codepre  pThe extra c2 appears from somewhere and I have absolutely no clue why my encoded string decodes to this. i am using a hrefhttpcodebeautify.orghexstringconverter relnofollowthisa to encode. I have tried other encoders but with same result. Whats wrong here p  pstrongEDITstrong So I checked string without codea3code and I think its codea3code thats creating problem. How should I encode codea3codep
