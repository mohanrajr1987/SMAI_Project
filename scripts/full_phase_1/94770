Positive 94770 pIve got a uirouter application with a large number of states, and I need to be able to pass a model through stateParams.  On every http request, I check the response for a STATE parameter, which is returned from the server. If it exists, I execute codestate.goSTATEcode.  p  pSo effectively, Ive got my codestateProvidercodep  precodestateProvider     .stateAccount, url Account, template ltuiviewgt     .stateAccount.name,          url Name,         templateUrl appAccountpartialsName.html,         controller AccountNameController as nameVm      codepre  pAnd many more states that look just like this.  p  pI have a data model that is just a factory with an object that is get and set via functions.

Positive 94770 pOur app currently utilizes emui.routerem to facilitate UI states as well as leveraging the codestateParamscode service.  Ideally Id like to continue using this.p  pI just saw this documentation that the new Angular Router makes use of some component lifecycle hooks  a hrefhttpsangular.github.iorouterlifecycle relnofollowhttpsangular.github.iorouterlifecyclea.  I dont know if this is part of Angular 2 or something builtin specifically to NG Router. Id like to leverage this functionality as we do not utilize any emresolveem paradigms in our app.  p  pIf this is something wholly incompatible with ui.router, how would one go about implementing a similar solution such that a controller and template could be preloaded, with codecanActivatecode amp codeactivatecode methods on the controllerp
Positive 94770 pSo I am using UIRouter to build my AngularJS app. However I am confused as to how the URL Routing works in case of nested states mainly due to the conflicting ideas as per my understanding provided in the wiki for UIRouter.p  pstrongThe first ideastrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com34zi0.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com34zi0.png altidea 1a Hence maybe abstract state is used belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comIykN6.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIykN6.png altidea 1ap  pstrongThe second ideastrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comNSqNs.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNSqNs.png altidea 2ap  pAs given in the documentation first idea, url of parent state is prepended to that of its children only in case of abstracttrue property defined on the parent state. p  pHowever the documentation second idea also mentions how the above is a default feature.p  pArent the two ideas above conflicting for the same concept  Or have I completely misunderstood them p

Positive 94770 pIm new to Angular and states and wrapping my head around uirouter. Ive been doing it with jQuery for too long. In jQuery, I can load up something with ajax, then on the success, perhaps run another function. How do you do that with Angularp  pFor example, I have the following p  precodevar ivApp  angular.moduleivApp, [ui.router]  ivApp.configfunctionurlRouterProvider, stateProvider    urlRouterProvider.otherwise    stateProvider     .statehome,        url ,       templateUrl partialspartialhome.html         codepre  pWhich simply loads up codepartialhome.htmlcode into my codeuiviewcode. But how to tell it to run a function once that is done For example, I have codeauthenticate.jscode and a function codeauthenticatecode. How do I run authenticate once home state has loadedp  pAdditionally, can I tell angular to only load authenticate.js for this state Or should I have already loaded it in the template. I know that if I include the script in partialhome.html e.g. codeltscript srcauthenticate.jsgtltscriptgtcode chrome throws me an error about synchronous xmlhttprest being deprecated. So somhow in the config, can I declare authenticat.js as a dependency of the state or something like thatp  pAt the moment I have worked out I can do something likep  precodeivApp.controllerauthenticate, functionscope      start authorisation   authenticate   codepre  pAnd then define the controller authenticate in my uirouter states. But is that how its done It works basically. My authenticate function is doing things like changing things in the DOM, but I read controllers shouldnt be used for this.p  pThanks for any pointersp

To do that, we must ourselves crawl over all pages in our application with a headless browser and store the html into a file that will be served.

Its not super elegant for now, but it does the job.p  pThis script can be well integrated with angularloadingbar as it tracks the readiness of the overall application. The progress bar could be an indicator of that progress. The drawback of this is that it has conflicts with the natural behaviour of angularloadingbar tracking XHR requests.p  pFor example, in my controllers I use this p  precodeapp.controllerWorksController, [      scope, cfpLoadingBar,      function scope, cfpLoadingBar          cfpLoadingBar.start         scope.imgLoadedEvents               always function                   cfpLoadingBar.complete                            ] codepre  pThis code should be migrated right in the rootScope script that tracks the readiness of the views.p  precoderootScope.watchstatus, functionnewValue, oldValue     if newValue  loading cfpLoadingBar.start      else if newValue  ready  cfpLoadingBar.complete   codepre  pThough, angularprogressbar still works in the background. I let active the XHR interceptor. Though, if an XHR requests is completed before the image has loaded, the progress bar disappears even if the views have not finished. As well, if an image has loaded before the XHR request is completed, the progress bar disappears.p  pHow can I integrate the XHR interception capabilities of the angularloadingbar with this view readiness interception capabilitiesp

Negative 94770 pI have a Windows Service developed in C and .NET 3.5 to perform various administrative tasks throughout our 3 domains. Ive got an admin account in each domain that has the necessary rightspermissions for what this service is doing.p  pFor all the AD interactions, I can bind to AD using the correct usernamepassword for the domain and all is good. However, I have a need now to launch an external process robocopy to perform some work and I cannot find any code examples anywhere for doing this in .NET 3.5.p  pWhat I need to do is launch robocopy using alternate credentials in a hidden window, capture the standard output so I have a log of what was actually done, and capture the exit code so I can tell if it was successful.p  pI found some old .NET 1.1 code from a hrefhttpodetocode.comBlogsscottarchive20041028602.aspx relnofollowK. Scott Allens bloga see the last few comments for a good code listing that extends the System.Diagnostics.Process object and calls the Win32 API function CreateProcessAsUserW. However, the code doesnt work due to some API changes in .NET 2.0. Using the code snippet from the last comment on the referenced blog where it is using reflection to call the private SetProcessHandle function of the Process object causes Access Denied errors when I try to interact with the process to kill it or get exit code.p  pDoes anyone have a good example of how to accomplish thisp  pEDIT The builtin .NET Process and ProcessStartInfo API does allow you to specify alternate credentials but when you do, it wants to create a visible window even if you specify CreateNoWindow or WindowStyle Hidden which fails when running as a Windows Service. So those are not an option for this application. Impersonation doesnt work either since when the external process is launched, it uses the credentials of the parent process, not the impersonated credentials.p  pSOLUTION As Reed pointed out below, PInvoke using one of the Win32 API functions should allow you to make this happen. I ended up going a slightly different route using an old a hrefhttpss64.netwestlakent relnofollowfreeware NT4 utility called RunProcessa that allows you to specify a usernamepassword on the command line. It worked on Vista and 2k3 and also worked correctly when launched by a windows service running as Local System.p

Negative 94770 pI know its kinda subjective but, if you were to put yourself in my shoes strongwhich would you invest the time in learningstrongp  pI want to write a web app which deals securely with relatively modest amounts of peoples private data, a few thousand records of a few Kb each but stuff that needs to be kept safe, addresses, phone numbers etc. Ive done several web projects in PHPMYSQL and have decided, handy though it is I really dont like PHP and dont want to do another large project in it...p  pAs such I figure Id best learn something new and so I am considering 2 options although Ill happily entertain others if you have suggestions. Im having terrible trouble deciding though. They both look quite involved so rather than just jump in and potentially waste days getting up to speed enough on both of them to make an informed choice I thought Id come here and canvas some opinion.p  pSo the two options Im considering are...p  pstrongOne of the PYTHON Web frameworksstrong  TurboGears seems well regarded Advantage Of all the languages I ever tried Python is by far and away my favorite. Theres loads of frameworks to choose from and I have done quite a lot of non web python coding over the last few years.  Disadvantage Theres loads to choose from so its hard to pick Need to run single server process or modpython which I dont like the sound of. What I do like is the notion of process separation and compartmentalization, i.e. if one users account is compromised it gives an attacker no leverage against the rest of the system. Im not clear to what extent a python solution would handle that.p  pstrongWriting it as a SEASIDE appstrong Which I guess runs on a squeak app server Adv From what Ive heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private VM independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a security, scaling and redundancy standpoint. Dis Ive not done any Smalltalk since Uni 15 years back and I never dug too deep into it then. I dont see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using it. I suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason i.e. not because its inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with SqeakSmalltalk.p  pSo, what do people think Would I be able to efficiently get the kind of strong separation and compartmentalization Im after with a Python framework Is Seaside as good as I think in terms of insulating users from each other Might I be better off, security wise, sticking to the languages Im most familiar with so I dont make any n00b mistakes or will Seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more secure, comprehensible and maintainable in the long run At the end of the day its not a life or death decision and I can always bail if I start with one and then hate it so pls nobody get all holy language war and start flaming anyone p  pCheers for any replies this gets,p  pRoger p
Negative 94770 pIm using the web application at a hrefhttpm.rummble.com relnofollowhttpm.rummble.coma website and when I click find my location using gears. The application returns my current location approximate city location with various establishments in a given mile radius.

Then the google server responds with 200 OK and location data in JSON format. I understand this part. The next step is what I dont understand. Apparently after the rummble application receives the location data lat, long, address, etc. it sends this information using a GET request to some api on another server that acquires the various establishments in a given mile radius.

I have seen many single window WPF application examples that dont need to be anything else but a single window and ive  looked at applications such as FamilyShow which looked promising until all I could see in the code was a big pile of user controls that faded in and out over the lifetime of the application and not something I could really use for lets say a 3040 views in an application.p  pSo what exactly am I asking Well should I build a LOB application as a single WPF window with lets say a panel that has user controls dynamically loaded into it and then swap these out when lets say a navigation item is pressed or should I have multiple window forms that get shown or hidden when lets say a navigation item is pressed from a launching main form.p  pUI Design has never really been my strengh but im keen to learn so I would really appreciate your thoughts and offered experience in laying out your WPF LOB applications WindowUCs or Windows or could point me to any articles that cover WPF UI Layout design for LOB applications.p  pThanks for reading...p  pGeoff.p

Negative 94770 pI have a data set consisting of timestamped values, and absolute meter values.

I have several places where I calculate these totals for a given time period for several sets at once, and thus it becomes quite the performance bottleneck. The noncursor method can also be easily modified to GROUP BY the key and return all the sets at once  but this actually is even slower in my testing than running the cursor multiple times, because there is the additional overhead of the GROUP BY and SUM operation, aside from it being slower overall anyways.p

Negative 94770 pIm trying to create a page curl animation of an image in my iPhone application. I t UIViewAnimationTransitionCurlUp, and its undocumented Core Animation siblings, however the image I need to animate is a transparent PNG, with uneven some alpha pixels outlines. When using the aforementioned premade transition, those alpha pixels are painted black as soon as the animation starts, which looks terribly ugly.p  pTherefore, I seek to create a Core Animation of my own. I have tried to research the subject, but have been unable to find a good overview of the techniques involved. The implementation would of course have to be more complex than a single property change, I get the feeling that even CATransform3D would be to limited for this purpose, as the image needs to have different 3D transformations applied in different parts of it  changing over time. How would one then go about this subject Im very grateful for any thoughts or ideasp  pBest, Elip

Negative 94770 pIm writing a C program that has a large number of classes. In my head I can visualise them as distinct collections. For example theres a collection of classes for reading and storing config data, and another collection for drawing a user interface with various widgets.p  pEach of those collections could be neatly stored inside separate namespaces, which seems sensible. The config part has a screen class, and the GUI part also has a screen class, but they are different to each other. I could rename one guiscreen and the other configscreen, but thats the point of a namespace isnt it To remove these prefixes we invent to separate things.p  pPart of me then thinks itd be tidy to store those namespaces inside one main one so that none of my code can interfere with the namespaces of anything else. And I suppose it might also make the code more readable too.p  pOr am I just making overly complex hierarchies of data for no reason at allp

Negative 94770 pI have read that there is some overhead to using C exceptions for exception handling as opposed to, say, checking return values. Im only talking about overhead that is incurred when no exception is thrown. Im also assuming that you would need to implement the code that actually checks the return value and does the appropriate thing, whatever would be the equivalent to what the catch block would have done. And, its also not fair to compare code that throws exception objects with 45 state variables inside to code that returns a negative integer for every error.p  pIm not trying to build a case for or against C exceptions solely based on which one might execute faster. I heard someone make the case recently that code using exceptions ought to run just as fast as code based on return codes, once you take into account all the extra bookkeeping code that would be needed to check the return values and handle the errors.

Negative 94770 pI am new to SSIS, so please bear with me.p  pI created an Integration Services Project for SQL Server 2008 to import data from an old db to a new one.

My current approach is a three step processp  ol liAdd OLE DB Source component that pulls all columns from my first source tableli liAdd a Lookup component, which is the next step after my OLE DB Source component.  In this I query the second source table using the results of a sql query that returns no nulls, then drag the foreign key id from the available input columns to the primary key in the available lookup columns.  I also check the checkboxes in available input columns to add 2 more columns.li liAdd OLE DB Destination, pointed to my destination table.li ol  pThis process fails at the first step, not at the lookup step, and fails with the error Row yielded no match during lookup.  The foreign key cannot be null, and obviously the primary key cant either.  I used a SQL statement in step to so I could make sure I dont get any null date values in the columns there were a few but I am still getting the error.  If I output the first step failure path to a Flat File Destination, I get an empty CSV watching in debug mode says 600k records go into the flat file.  p  pI am pretty stumped at this point and this seems like it should be super easy task.

Negative 94770 phow do i add Form validation, with multiple rules on a single textfield,  and a different action depending on the rulep  pfor example, a faq module, with predefined questions, the user can save and  or publish his answers.p  pi have a form, with 1 textarea and 2 buttons  1 button submits the form to save the entered value in the database as draft 1 button submits the form to save and publish the entered value.p  precodeltformgt     ltinput typehidden classanswerdraftgt     ltlabel classanswerlabel foranswergtAnswerltlabelgt     lttextarea nameanswer classanswer rows8 cols40gtlttextareagt     ltinput classsubmitAnswer typesubmit valueSavegt     ltinput typebutton classpublishAnswer valueSave amp Publishgt ltformgt codepre  pon page load, an existing draft value if there is one is displayed inside the textfield, the user should not be able to save, but can publish if the field is empty the user should not be able to save or publish if the field has text, and different from the existing draft the user can save and  or publish.p  pi have been using jquery validate for a while now but mainly with basic validation of required fields and testing a regex for email and such, but its unclear to me how i can manage the above to validate correctlyp  pi have tried it out, code below current code for ease of reading the question object is the container div where the form is in.p  precodetextarea.answer, question.validate     valid functionval         var answerdraft  input.answerdraft, question.val         enablebutton.submitAnswer, question         enablebutton.publishAnswer, question         return val   ampamp val.matchs ampamp val  answerdraft     ,     errorMessage functionval         var answerdraft  input.answerdraft, question.val         ifval  answerdraft                      disablebutton.submitAnswer, question             enablebutton.publishAnswer, question                  else                      disablebutton.submitAnswer, question             disablebutton.publishAnswer, question                  return t.validationanswerrequired     ,     appendCompletionIcon true  codepre  pThis does not entirely what i want, it uses only 1 rule, and then in the error method i test to set the righ tbuttons enabled, but that means that buttons get enabled correctly but the textfield gets the error state sometimes when it does not need to show an error but rather neutral state.p  pi believe i will need to redo my logic, without doing it inside 1 valid or error function, but using the rules option, but its unclear how i can bind the enable  disable functionality to the buttons with the rules object. p  panyone to point me in the right direction is very welcome.p

Negative 94770 pIf I have a class p  precodeinterface Foo      NSString temp   propertynonatomic, copy NSString temp  end codepre  pI understand that upon assignment, the old temp will get released and the new one will be assigned using codetemp  [newTemp copy]code. And going by memory management rules, you are supposed to do code[temp release]code in the dealloc method of Foo, right p  pWhat I dont understand is what happens if the setter was never used  you still have the code[temp release]code in the dealloc, so its releasing something with a retain count of 0. Can someone clarify this for mep

Negative 94770 pI have a maven project that has both code and documentation pdf files. When I create a release of my software, Id like to package the jar file and the documentation for the user.

Negative 94770 pI plan to use two tables i.e. guest and employee to control which page is available to which user.p  pThe guess can sign up for an account while the employee cannot. The account of an employee can only be assigned by a system administrator.p  pHere is the question I just foundp  pAssume UserA is a employee and has login001 as user name and password as password.p  pNow, a guess comes to the website and applies for a user name with login001 and password as password.p  pThen the userB can access some internal websites bc heshe chose the same usernamepassword as one of the employee does.p  pHere is my fix to this problemp  pMethod one Whenever a user name is applied not matter guess or employee, the both table guess and employee should be checked to make sure there is no duplicate.p  pMethod two Combine guess and employee tables together as person table. However, for guess, the usertype can be assigned as GUEST and for employee, the usertype can be assigned as EMPLOYEE.p  pI dont know whether above methods make sense or not. If neither or them are good solutions, please give me some direction so that I can adopt some best practice.p  pI am NOT using any framework or OOP to implement my PHP script.p  pThank youp

Negative 94770 pPreviously, in rails 2.3.8 i used the prototypehelpers codelinktoremotecode and codeformremoteforcode amongst others. p  pThese had the option codeupdatecode as followsp  precodelinktoremote Add to cart,   url gt  action gt add, id gt product.id ,   update gt  success gt cart, failure gt error  codepre  pan example from the a hrefhttpapi.rubyonrails.orgclassesActionViewHelpersPrototypeHelper.htmldocumentationa. This example would, upon success update the htmlelement with class cart, and upon failure the class error.p  pNow i believe the modus operandi has changed, instead we writep  precodelinkto Add to cart, url gt action gt add, id gt product.id,      remote gt true codepre  pand there is no option to set codeupdatecode anymore.

Negative 94770 pI am building a website for a client that wants to sell photos on his website. Its set with Paypal, and I made the buttons link to Paypal. This all works fine except, the client wants his photos to display in the cart section, right before the check out page. Paypal allows you to customize this section, but it is very limiting.  Additionally, there is no way it comes close to how I want it to appear. I just would like a solution so I can bypass the Paypal cart and go to my own customized cart instead and then to paypal for the final order. p  pHere is a link to exactly what I want to a accomplish.  I hope this helps facilitate what I am trying to sayp  pa hrefhttpwww.widerange.orgphotomontefitzroyalpenglowgalleryfavorites relnofollowhttpwww.widerange.orgphotomontefitzroyalpenglowgalleryfavoritesa   p  pNotice that when you click codeadd to cartcode, it stays on his site and his cart features images of what you added.  Paypal does not have this kind of feature, at least not to my knowledge.p  pI hope its somewhat of a easy solution, and I would like to avoid going through a third party ecommerce site to do this.p  pAnother question not as important and seems pretty basicp  pI also would like to know exactly what the merchant ID key does in the paypal account and can I use it for any wordpress cart widgets Seen a few that have some nice cart features that I think would be handy for clients. Fiddled with these and noticed that all they need is a merchant key to have them functioning. My best guess is that it helps link to the paypal account I am also aware that this could be referring to a number you get for your business account. Either way I am really just experimenting with all my options and just trying to find the cheapest solution for my client, but not that sleazy type of cheap.  Im pretty sure I can figure all this out with some research but figured while people are reading this might as well get as much basic info as possible. p  pThanks so far for the responses they really help and is much appreciated. p

Now I am trying to create two versions of a program in XDR file Just curious but its not working out for me.p  phere is my new XDR filep  precodeanirudhanirudhAspire5920DocumentsCDSRPC cat spec.x  program MSGPROG      version PRINTMSGVERSION         int PRINTMSGstring  1       1      version PRINTMSGVERSION         int PRINTMSGstring  1       2    0x2000001 codepre  pHere is the server codep  precodeanirudhanirudhAspire5920DocumentsCDSRPC cat server.c  includeltstdio.hgt include spec.h  int printmsg1svcchar msg,struct svcreq  sr     static int ret      printfversion  1sn,msg     ret  1     return ampret       int printmsg2svcchar msg,struct svcreq  sr     static int ret      printfversion  2sn,msg     ret  1     return ampret      codepre  pHere are the errors that I get at compile timep  precodeanirudhanirudhAspire5920DocumentsCDSRPC rpcgen C spec.x anirudhanirudhAspire5920DocumentsCDSRPC gcc server.c specsvc.c o aniserver lnsl In file included from server.c2 spec.h32 warning PRINTMSGVERSION redefined spec.h18 note this is the location of the previous definition In file included from specsvc.c6 spec.h32 warning PRINTMSGVERSION redefined spec.h18 note this is the location of the previous definition codepre  pSo the error is coming because I am not able to figure out how to declare two versions of a program in XDR file.

Negative 94770 pIm hoping to use Azures AppFabric ServiceBus to host a PublishSubscribe messaging system.  My clients will all be mobile devices android, Iphone etc... running hybrid applications.p  pMy question is can my mobile clients receive messages from a publisher hosted in Azure  I dont really care much about the message format at this point Soap, XML, Json.  I care more about the bidirectional communication at this point.p
Negative 94770 pCurrently Im developing two drivers for an Arm 9 embedded application.  They are both i2c drivers that each utilize an IO expander pcf8575.  I have tested the drivers independently, but when I compile them both into the kernel and run my main application I get the core dump below.  It doesnt normally occur during the first driver access.  It seems to happen randomly.  It definitely happening when my driver call the i2c driver to transmit on the I2c bus i2cmastersendclient, ampbuff[0], count .  I will attach the main files for my two drivers.  They are similar and both very simple.  I have done a lot of testing of them independently.  I have ruled this out as a hardware issue by getting the same results on two very different pieces of hardware.  I guess Im just not even sure when it says a kernel paging request where to even start looking.  I have trouble believing the problem is in the i2ccore driver, but this is the section of code where it is dying on.  p  precodegt Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000b9a81 gt

In the remarks section it tellsp  pGetType only works on assemblies loaded from disk. If you call GetType to look up a type defined in a dynamic assembly defined using the System.Reflection.Emit services, you might get inconsistent behavior. The behavior depends on whether the dynamic assembly is persistent, that is, created using the RunAndSave or Save access modes of the System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilderAccess enumeration. If the dynamic assembly is persistent and has been written to disk before GetType is called, the loader finds the saved assembly on disk, loads that assembly, and retrieves the type from that assembly. If the assembly has not been saved to disk when GetType is called, the method returns Nothing. GetType does not understand transient dynamic assemblies therefore, calling GetType to retrieve a type in a transient dynamic assembly returns Nothing.p  pIs that some thing causing me the problem .

Negative 94770 pI have the following structurep  pViewsp  pHomep  pArticlesp  pPartial Viewsp  pBookp  pClassesp  pIntrop  pFaqp  pOn the top of the page, in my header, is a navigation menu  containing multiple Ajax.ActionLinks that call into different methods in my HomeController class to fetch a particular partial view and then place that content in my center DIV.  So I can click on the Faq link, and the content in the center DIV of my page will now contain the partial view for my Faq.  Now, I have an Articles view that will look completely different and therefore needs to be separated as its own view as opposed to a partial view, and, the problem that I am running into is if I click on my Html.ActionLink for Articles, I am navigated to my Articles view, which is what I want, but then if I click on one of the other links that are Ajax.ActionLinks, I need somehow the view to change back to my Home view so that I can then retrieve the requested partial view and place that into my center DIV.  Any idea how I can do this  Right now the AJAX.ActionLink, when being called while on my Articles View, is calling into my HomeController, but then trying to replace the content in my center DIV which doesnt exist in my Articles view, and additionally, its not loading the HomeView.p  pAny thoughts on how to best achieve this  Also, I am not using the Razor engine.p  pSo, the navigational menu, which is a set of links, resides in my Site.Master file.  Here is one of the links that I havep  precode  lt Ajax.ActionLinkBook, LoadBook, new AjaxOptions  HttpMethod  Post, UpdateTargetId  content, InsertionMode  InsertionMode.Replace gt codepre  pWhen clicking on this link, the method LoadBook in my HomeController is called.  Refer to the code belowp  precodepublic ActionResult LoadBook      return PartialViewBook  codepre  pIn my Home.aspx view, I have the following codep  precodeltdiv idcontentgt    lt Html.RenderPartialIntro gt ltdivgt codepre  pThis code will automatically load the partial view for my intro introduction by default whenever initially loading the Home view.  So basically, since the link for Articles is Html.ActionLink as opposed to Ajax.ActionLink, when it is clicked I am taken to the Articles view.  When I click on, for example, the Book Ajax.ActionLink in my Site.Master header while on the Articles view, the code will try to update a content DIV with the Book partial view.  This behavior is only wanted when on the Home view, for obvious reasons.  So, how can I have different behavior for my Ajax.ActionLinks when viewing a view that is different than my Home viewp  pThanksp  pChrisp

Negative 94770 pIn my quest to generate new code in a Scala compiler plugin, I have now created working classes. The next logical step is to put those classes in a new, nonexisting package. In Java, a package is basically a directory name, but in Scala a package seems much more complicated.

Negative 94770 pIn my app I have created a codeUITableViewcode which finds and parses the XML of the Apple hot news rss feed.. It takes the XML data and I parse and code it so each codeUITableViewCellcode has  the posts name and if you select it it pushes to a codeUIViewControllercode with a web view displaying that article. There are many different articles so many different cells. What I want to do is I want to sort the articles cells in this case together into different categories e.g.p  piPad iPhone Steve Jobs Musicp  pand so on...p  pI am not so sure how I can present this, how can I edit the codeUITableViewcode so it can sort itself and put labels in the middle and so on I think you get the point. That is my uncertainty.p  pI have an approach a not very reliable way though of categorizing them, for example in the case of iPhone I will find the cells title which comes from the codeRSSItemcode and see if it has the substring of iPhonep  precode if [[[cell textLabel] text] rangeOfStringiPhone].location  NSNotFound   NSLogFound an iPhone category    codepre  pI know this is not reliable and involves a not very tediouslongtrial and error not logical method.

Negative 94770 pI normally delete all of my text messages but this time i accidentally deleted a conversation that I need.  I took a backup first time of my iphone 4. I then used IPhone backup extractor to extract the sms.db from the backup.  Using sqlite3, I see tons of tutorials that I can view my deleted sms messages.  However, all of the tables appear to be empty.  When I look at the sms.db file in notepad, I do see bits and pieces of messages that I deleted both long ago and recently.  However, Im not seeing anywhere near all of my messages and Im assuming they are there somewhere.  How do I go about seeing these if the sqlite products are unable to see them but I know its there.  Thanks.p

Negative 94770 pThis is basically a best practices question. Struts 1 forms have getters and setters for retrievingsetting form properties. Should they be used for just that, or a getter lets say can have logic or some form of preprocessing that potentially modifies the property before giving it to the jspaction Another alternative is to use the logic or the same preprocessing in the action class before setting it into the form attribute and hence, the getter will be free of this processing. p  pWhich one is the recommended way p

Negative 94770 pI have an app that needs to connect to a particular AP. This AP is not connected to the internet.  when i change networks in settings  to this new AP, i can see that i have received an ip address within a few seconds, but it takes 6070 seconds for the wifi symbol in the status bar to appear. when i return to my app, i cannot connect to the AP until this symbol appears. once it appears, the connection works perfectly, but 60 seconds is a long time for the user to wait. I am using NSStreamManager to commuicate with the AP.p  pI do not understand why i can not connect as soon as settings shows an ip address. I know that apple does not allow for inapp control of network settings. any suggestions would be appreciated.p  pFurther Informationp  pIn an effort to understand the problem, I added a timer loop that starts as soon as i open the app, after changing to the new wifi network. it reports reachability status via the apple reachability class and attempts to get the SSID. if these two methods succeed then it sends a JSON message to the AP using streamManager, if not it calls itself again in one second.  The plug is reachable and the SSID readable, on the very first loop less than 1 second BUT it still takes stream manager the balance of the 60 seconds to complete. I dont believe the problem is on the AP side, as the android version of the app has no problem connecting. p  precodeBOOLdidConnect    NSString ssidString[self.serverCommManager fetchSSIDInfo]    NSString ssidStart[ssidString substringToIndex5]    NSLogdidConnect ssidStart ,ssidStart    if[ssidStart isEqualToStringPpppp]        NSLogdidConnect isEqualTRUE        self.streamManager  [[NSStreamManager alloc] initWithDelegateself]        [self.streamManager connectToHostPlugHostName onPortPlugPort withMessage  [JSONQuery queryIsPlug]]        [self removeWaitView]         return YES     else          NSLogPlugSetupTVC didConnect isEqualFALSE         [self startTimingWithInterval1]         return NO        codepre

Negative 94770 pWell, this is not at all an optimization question.p  pI am writing a for now simple Linux kernel module in which I need to find the average of some positions. These positions are stored as floating point i.e. codefloatcode variables. I am the author of the whole thing, so I can change that, but Id rather keep the precission of float and not get involved in that if I can avoid it.p  pNow, these position values are stored or at least used to in the kernel simply for storage. One user application writes these data through shared memory I am using RTAI, so yes I have shared memory between kernel and user spaces and others read from it.

Negative 94770 pI work on embedded systems with limited memory and throughput. Making a system more robust requires more memory, and time on the processor. I like the idea of the a hrefhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog201104workingwiththechaosmonkey.html relnofollowChaos Monkeya to figure out if your system is fault tolerant, however with limited resources Im not sure how feasible it is to just keep adding code to it. Are there certain design considerations whether in the architecture or otherwise that would improve the fault handling capabilities, without necessarily adding more code to a system p  pOne way I have seen to help in preventing writing an if then statement in c or c that assigns rather then compares a static value, recommends writing that on the left hand side of the comparison, this way if you try to assign your variable to say the number 5, things will complain and youre likely to find any issues right away.p  pAre there Architectural or Design decisions that can be made early on that prevent possible  redundancyreliability issues in a similar wayp

I can stop this by setting a fixed height, but this isnt an acceptable solution as a reasonable fixed height will differ for each selection.p  pEssentially Id like a codeWrapPanelcode whose height changes dynamically based on the width of the panel and the amount of items contained within.p  pTo illustratep  pIf the panel is wide enough to show 3 columns it willp  p 1  5  9  p  p 2  6    p  p 3  7         Height4p  p 4  8    p  pBut if the user changes the size of the window to the point where it can only accomodate 2 columns the height will increasep  p 1  6  p  p 2  7  p  p 3  8       Height  5p  p 4  9  p  p 5    p  pAlso, Im not sure how feasible this is but I would ideally like the order the items horizonatally but keep the orientation vertical, so theyd be orderedp  p 1  2  3  p  p 4  5  6  p  p 7  8  9  p  pCould anyone tell me how to go about getting started with this Im assuming its possible with a custom implementation of the codeWrapPanelcode, but Im slightly confused how to get started.p  pThanks,p

Negative 94770 pI have been looking over a couple of classes I have in an android project, and I realized that I have been mixing logic with data. Having realized how bad this can be to the readability and the testability of my project, I decided to do some refactoring in order to abstract away all services logic to separate services modules. However, since I have been relying on Javas polymorphism, I got lost and need some guidance. p  pSuppose I have this tobechanged layout for a super data class, and two subclassesp  precodepublic class DataItem       some variables        public saveToDB Some Arguments            do some stuff            public render           render the class         public class ChildDataItemA extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemA            Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemA         public class ChildDataItemB extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemB            Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemB        codepre  pNow, I thought about moving the codesaveToDBcode and coderendercode methods to a service class. However, sometimes I need to be able to call these method into instance of compiled type codeDataItemcode without knowing its runtime type. For instance, I might want to make the following callp  precodeListltDataItemgt dataList  for DataItem item dataList      item.saveToDB     item.render  codepre  pAdditionally, I thought of doing the followingp  precodepublic class ChildDataItemB extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemB           Service.saveToDBB           Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemB          Service.renderB       codepre  pWhere I still keep dummy methods in each subclass that would call an appropriate service method. However, I do not think that this really achieves the separation I want since data classes will still know about services bad. p  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp  pEdit Note that coderendercode and codesaveToDBcode are just generic examples of what these methods can be, so the problem is not really about choosing an ORM or SQL related techniques.p

Negative 94770 pI have a jsp page called diary.jsp where the action class associated with it is called DiaryAction and in this class I am using the populate method to prepopulate fields.

The selector is still queued on the threads run loop and performed as soon as possible.p blockquote  pI cant determine why one should write code[self performSelectorselectordoSomething withObjectnil afterDelay0]code, as opposed to merely writing code[self doSomething]code.  It seems to me that a delay of zero means that the call should be made immediately.  Clearly Im missing something, its unlikely that the framework author chose this approach at random.  Other StackOverflow answers dont shed any light on this either.

Negative 94770 pI am working in Java Web Service with Jersey. Id like to understand how could handle the following problemp  pApparently, a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comotnpubjcpjaxrs1.1mrelevalothJSpecjaxrs11mrelspec.pdfAuthParam1355345006d62ab40be00174f091ae132f0b4d724f relnofollowJAXRS JSR 311a for every situation with 406 Status, say that response will have no entity. For example, in section 3.7.2 Request Matching, Identify the method that will handle the requestp  blockquote   pAt least one of the acceptable response entity body media types is a supported output data   format see section 3.5. If no methods support one of the acceptable response entity body   media types an implementation MUST generate a WebApplicationException with a   not acceptable response HTTP 406 status and no entity. The exception MUST be processed as described in section 3.3.4.p blockquote  pHowever, RFC 2616 recommends another thingp  blockquote   p10.4.7 406 Not Acceptablep      pThe resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.p      pUnless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available entity characteristics and locations from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the ContentType header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection.p  precode  Note HTTP1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are   not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the   request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a   406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of   an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable. codepre blockquote  pSo, what should I do for Jersey include an entity containing a list of available entity characteristics in 406 scenario.p
Negative 94770 pI know most people use the approach below and create a translation table for the specific table that needs translations but this can amount to a load of tables.p  precodeCREATE TABLE Product       Productid     ,ProductTransid  FK   CREATE TABLE ProductTranslation       ProductTransid     ,Productid     ,Name     ,Descr     ,langcode  codepre  pWould the below approach be viable Say you have lots of tables where more than 1 column needs translating. Could you do the following nad keep all translations in 1 table I suppose this table would grow hugely in size over time.p  precode   CREATE TABLE translationentry            translationid        int,           languageid           int,           tablename            nvarchar200,           tablecolumnname     nvarchar200,           tablerowid          bigint,           translatedtext       ntext               CREATE TABLE translationlanguage            id int,           languagecode CHAR2             codepre  pSo using the second approach you would get the text like sop  precodeselect       product.name      ,translationentry.translatedtext from product inner join  translationentry on product.productid  translationentry.tablerowid  and translationentry.tablename  Product and translationentry.tablecolumnname  Name and languageid  3 codepre

Negative 94770 pIm having some problems with an app i created. The general situation the following description is not 11 related to question I have a WCF clientserver app for collecting data at multiple sites. The client retrieves local data some files etc, sends it to the server in the datacenter and this server processes it. The client gets most of its data from the localhost, but some of it is retrieved from different servers on the LAN. Heres where my problem starts. I had to create a 3rd app which sends data to the stated client. In the reminder of this post i refer to client and server as the to apps on the same LAN so not the server in the datacenter abovep  pI tried using named pipes, which went superb interprocess on the same host, but was immense slow servertoserver. if anyone has thoughts on why this is plz dont hesitate to tell me. Some tests went up to 1000 ms sending and receiving just a few bytesp  pSo i went to using the TcpClient class. Tests showed responses much faster than the NP equivalents, so i decided to go with this option. p  pNow, when client and server start and end both as they are supposed to do, everything is fine. The problem arrises when the server is fired up, the client has connected, server is waiting its stream.Read method, and then the client app exitsp  pcodeUnable to read data from the transport connection De externe host heeft een verbinding verbroken.code 2nd part translation An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.p  pAt the moment i wrapped the whole part with a TryCatch statement, restarting the whole thing on a IoException.

Negative 94770 pI am wanting to use the scheduler module on Drupal 6 which adds some fields to a node edit page to Publish or Unpublish the node on a specific day and time. The problem is the scheduler is dependent on cron running. The part Im confused on is how could you possibly schedule a node to publish or unpublish at a specific time unless cron was just constantly running In other words, if I created a piece of content and scheduled for it to get published two days from now at 8 in the morning, unless cron was running at 8 in the morning, the node would not get published correct So say for example we only have our cron running twice a day say at 2 in the morning and maybe 2 in the afternoon Im just throwing out arbitrary times and we have our scheduler set to publish our article at 8 in the morning, it technically wouldnt get published until 2 in the afternoon when the second cron activity ran correct We obviously dont want cron running all the time as it probably wouldnt be good for the site. Am I missing something as far as how this stuff works OR does anyone have a better solution for allowing nodes to get published and unpublished at set dates and timesp  pThanksp

Negative 94770 pIm currently developing an android app that interacts with a RESTful webservice. The client is able to perform full CRUD on the webservice. After searching for best practices I watched the strongGoogle IO 2010 keynote about REST clientsstrong which is cited in almost all articles.p  pTo use as much of the android platform as possible, I decided to go with strongOption Bstrong using a codeContentProvidercode and a codeSyncAdaptercode.

Negative 94770 pIve got a BizTalk receive location, pointed at a remote UNC file share, that when I turn on the receive location it immediately turns off, and complains it does not have readwrite permissions on that directory. In the past when I have seen this, inevitably its because the BizTalk service account has not been given the full control permission, or because of unix permission issues. p  pHowever, in this case it is a windows file server, with the BizTalk service account given full control over this directory. So neither one of these seems to be the issue. Plus, on another machine, I created a share, gave the service account permissions, both UNC and NTFS, pointed BizTalk it it, and it worked like a charm.p  pThe only difference I can tell, is that they have given the group that the BizTalk service account is in, permissions higher up on in the directory structure. But that would simply imply that the service account has even a greater degree of permissions on that machine, not less.p  ul liAny ideas what could be causing thisli liIs there any tools or such that could help track down a windows auth issueli ul

Negative 94770 pLets say Ive got directed graph with 100k nodes and 500k edges. From them 15k nodes are important. I need to find 100 nearest important nodes starting from one specific node.p  pIve implemented Dijkstra algorithm in C, which finds distance from starting node to all other nodes. Then I sort important nodes by distance and return 100 first. This takes about 1 second.p  pNow I need to do the same at server side Linux with possibly many concurrent queries and different starting nodes. Ive tried node4j graph database, and after consulting with the developers, weve got solution which does the same in 1020 sec actually, if we compute paths without length limit, it takes about 10 min. It takes so long, because neo4j stores all shortest paths, and my C implementation stores only distances. The only option to make it faster in neo4j is to write extension which isnt trivial.p  pSo question is is there any graph db noncommercial that can be installed at Linux server and is able to run such query fast Ive checked all graph dbs from wikipedia list, and didnt find anything suitable.p  pAnother option is to implement same algorithm in Java and make a service Tomcat that will store shared copy of the graph how and will answer these queries. But Id prefer something ready...p
Negative 94770 pIve been trying to understand a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3177733howtoavoidjavacodeinjspfilesBalusCs answera with regard to debuggability, and I still cannot figure out exactly how jstl tags are more easily debugged than scriptlets.p  pWhen I think of debugging, I think of the ability to step through the code and determine at any given point what variables are loaded into memory, and see their contents.  With jstl, I cannot set up breakpoints of any kind, and if any part of it breaks, pieces of whatever form Im working on go missing.  Im not sure which is worse a blank page, or a halfloaded page.  Ive seen situations where when the jstl fails, OTHER parts of the form go missing rather than only the parts it affects.  In either case, its impossible to really see what the problem is.  p  pWith scriptlets, I can place breakpoints, and see any point Id like in an IDE.  Even if Im not using such a feature, I can print to the console any part of the procedure I want to see and figure it out later.  If the page fails and shows me a blank page, annoying as that may be, I can at least step through and find out exactly which line it fails on.p  pWith jstl, Im completely in the dark.  Iterating through a collection really feels like a black box where you hope everything comes out ok rather than actually being able to step through and watch it happen.  It makes you feel powerless.p  pI admit, jstl is cleaner, and looks more intuitive, but that one glaring problem I have is the inability to really debug anything on the page.  Am I completely mistaken here  Am I just missing the nice happy way to debug whats going on  Or is my approach to debugging incorrect, and in need of rethinkingp  pIve googled the issue, but I cant really seem to come up with any direct answers... If anyone has any insight on this, it would be really helpful.  I want to use jstl in lieu of scriptlets, and this is the one glaring thing keeping me back...p

Negative 94770 pI am using the Galleria jQuery slideshow and Im having an issue with the carousel of thumbnails on the bottom. I know that within the code, if a carousel is present too many thumbnails to display on the main page the thumbnailscontainer div has a class of .carousel added to it. This is not happening on mine, its just showing overflowed thumbnails. Also the right and left nav items have the .disabled class added to them on load.p  pIs there a known issue of why this would happen I cant seem to figure out what the issue is. The only error I get in the console on load is Uncaught Error Fatal error Could not extract a stage height from the CSS. Traced height 0px. but I dont believe this is related it could be though. The slideshow loads alright with this error and everything works except for the carousel. Thanks for the helpp

Negative 94770 pI find myself doing stuff like typing the last part of a command name because the beginning of it gets completed with other commands. Of course most other shells cant even complete stuff in this way yet. p  pAnyway, as an example, Ive got a script in my codePATHcode called codegitverbosestatuscode or something like that. Along with many others prefixed with codegitcode. It then becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between them as the prefixnamespace is populated. It really makes sense to emthinkem git because I named my program that for a reason. p  pSo it got me thinking. A mostrecentlyused ordering can be used on the string alreadytyped in order to perform matching. This should be strictly more helpful than doing completion alphabetically as I believe it is normally done. p  pIt could just be a simple reverse scan on command history. p

To test the app with my iPad, I am simply visiting the IP of the hostdevelopment computer at port 3000. However, for the Google API Client Redirect URI, I use..p  pcodehttpslocalhost3000callbacksouth2codep  pThis will not work on the iPad connected to a network IP for obvious reasons. I cannot use..p  pcodehttpsmy.net.ip.addr3000callbacksouth2codep  peither because Google does not accept that as valid redirect URI for the api client. So I am wondering.. Is there a better way to get this local development process to function.. or do I need to deploy the app to a production environment just to see it on an iPad p  pThank you all for the helpp

Negative 94770 pI have a strong C background and never really had a deep understanding of Java or C. However, I am curious about the internal workings of the virtual machines.

A long press on the button, followed by selection of Open from the context menu that appears, does work to download the APK from the stock browser.  Any ideas as to why the download doesnt start with a short press on the stock browserp  peditp  pI should mention that the button used to link to this download is located in an iframe.  If instead I do a document.location.href  download script URL instead of loading the scripts source into the iframe when the document loads, the download does work with a short press.  Something to do with how the stock browser handles iframes  The page and the script it points to are on the same domain.p

Negative 94770 pWhenever we want to create an Eclipse project with an existing source location, we will choose the existing source locationroot as the project location. Eclipse will create all the project specific files in the root directory of that source.p  pNow, for some reason if we want to recreate the project with different setting, how should we tell Eclipse to not remove the source but all the project related files  Its basically cleaning up all the Eclipse related files. For example, I want to create the project in some other IDE, do I have to go to the project directory and manually identify all the Eclipse related files and remove themp  pWhen we try to delete the project from Eclipse, we are left with two choices, delete everything from the project when checkbox is checked or retain everything in the project this would only remove the project from the project explorer but retains all the project related files in the root source directory.p  pEvery time, manually deleting project related files is cumbersome.

Negative 94770 pThe more I search Google and SO the more RESTful naming seems like more of a black art than a standard.  I would like to lay out a scenario I have and my current line of thinking and ask those of you with REST experience to weigh in.p  pI have a Packet object that you could think of as a physical folder or binder.  Inside this packet are one or more forms.  My system represents these as a resource called PacketForms.  Each form record has a SortIndex column that defines what order the forms are displayedprinted in.  p  pWhen I display the list of forms in the application, there are updown arrows that allow the user to change the forms SortIndex.  So, now Im ready to implement this action.p  pMy first thought was to have an operation specifically for promotingdemoting a form in the sort order.  If I go with this approach, based on what Ive seen here, it seems that I should think about the sort index emitselfem as a resource.  So, I could express my intention in a query string like so, rightp  pPUT PacketFormSortIndex5actionPromotep  pBut Ive also thought why not just update the PacketForm itself and let the backend look for changes in the SortIndex.  Rather than a promotedemote approach, if a SortIndex is changed I will swap it with the form that currently has that index.  So, if someone updates the PacketForm with SortIndex3 to have a value of SortIndex2, the system would update both records to accomplish the swap.p  pPersonally, I like the atomic nature of the first approach.  It has a very specific, clear purpose and the code on the back end is cleaner.  But if I propagate that logic across my system I worry a bit about resource sprawl.  p  pSo, I guess I have a two later question here.  Which, if either, of these approaches feels more RESTy to you  If it is the first, is it appropriate to use the querystring in the manner I proposed or is there a more RESTful way to organize that URL  p  pFor something that is being used so widely, Im really struggling with the wide variety of information Ive been finding so your perspective is much appreciated.p
Negative 94770 pI have a tough problem with PySide and Python3. The program crushes randomly because of memory problems.

Negative 94770 pThis might be a basic problem Im facing during integration of application over sailfin with a PSTN gateway. The initial INVITE is received from the gateway and processed internally then the 100 trying and 200 OK response is sent back to the gateway. But the gateway never responds back with ACK. p  pInitial investigation shows that the INVITE has been received from remote port xxxxx any random UDP port while inside INVITE Header, the  via header contains port as 5060 and the contact header also contains 5060. As the via header has port information 5060, Sailfin always sends responses back to the port 5060 instead of port xxxxx on which the request has been received. p  pIs there any way in Sailfin to ignore the via header information and send back the response to the port on which it has received the request Or do I need to manipulate the via headerp

Negative 94770 pIve seen several questionsanswers here that suggest the best way to get a string representation of an integer in ObjectiveC is to use code[NSString stringWithFormatd, x]code. Im afraid the CC programmer in me is having a hard time believing I want to bring all the formatting code into play for such a simple task. That is, I assume codestringWithFormatcode needs to parse through the format string looking for all the different type specifiers, field widths, and options that I could possibly use, then it has to be able to interpret that variable length list of parameters and use the format specifier to coerce codexcode to the appropriate type, then go through a lengthy process of conversion, accounting for signedunsigned values and negation along the way.p  pNeedless to say in CC I could simply use codeitoaxcode which does exactly one thing and does it extremely efficiently.p  pIm not interested in arguing the relative merits of one emlanguageem over another, but rather just asking the question is the incredibly powerful code[NSString stringWithFormatd, x]code emreallyem the most efficient way to do this very, very simple task in ObjectiveC Seems like Im cracking a peanut with a sledge hammer.p

Negative 94770 pI have two different objects which can belong to one parent object. These child objects can both also belong to each other many to many. Whats the best way to ensure that child objects which belong to each other also belong to the same parent object. p  pAs an example of what Im trying to do I have a codeKingdomcode which has both many codePeoplecode and codeLandcode. The codePeoplecode model would have a custom codevalidatecode which checks each related codeLandcode and  codeerror.addcodes if one has a mismatched codekingdomidcode. The codeLandcode model would have a similar codevalidatecode.p  pThis seems to work, but when updating it allows the record to save the codeTHIS IS AN ERRORcode error is in codepeople.errorscode, however the codeLandcode which raised the error has been added to the codePeoplecode collection.p  precodekingdom  Kingdom.create people   People.createkingdom gt kingdom land     Land.createkingdomid gt 999 people.lands ltlt land people.save puts people.errors.inspect  messagesbasegt[THIS IS AN ERROR] puts people.lands.inspect   [ltLand id 1... codepre  pIdeally Id want the error to cancel the record update.

Negative 94770 pI am fairly new to audio programming and Im thinking of building a tool in JAVA which can be used to hear classical music and identify the corresponding scale of it. I am particularly interested in the frequencies of each note and its variation from its subsequent frequency.p  pI need to find the scale based on the difference in frequencies in both the ascending and descending scale. The main challenge is that the frequency of the base note C can vary.p  pIve heard of FFT algorithms that can be used to find the frequency, but this is completely new to me so any information would be really helpful. p
Negative 94770 pIm writing code in C for Android. The main code is written in Java, but I would like to start another thread invoked from JNI call and access assets from C. However, when I pass codeAAssetsManagercode from codegetAssetscode, it works only within scope of JNI function call. When other thread tries to use, I get an invalid pointer. I also made sure that the object codeAAssetsManagercode is not garbage collected by writing it to a static variable. Do you have any advice on how I could make it workp  pIn other works, I would like to access codeAAssetManagercode and cache in other object.p  pThanksp
Negative 94770 pI am trying to make a call to an api url via an android program which will in turn authorize the username and password entered in the android program. The http request call will return a statuscode of 200 or 404 which tells me that the username and password was authorised. It seems that the doInBackground code never makes a proper network call.

Negative 94770 pIve done a few searches here, and while some issues are a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6190578howtoimportexcelfileswithdifferentnamesandsameschemaintodatabasesimilara, they dont seem to be exactly what I need.p  pWhat Im trying to do is import an Excel file into a SQL table via SSIS, but the problem is that I will never know the exact filename.  We get files at no steady interval, and the file usually has a datemonth in the name.  For instance, our current file is Census Data  May 2013.xls.  We will only ever load ONE file at a time, so I dont need to loop through a directory for multiple Excel files.p  pMy concept is that I can take this file, copy it to a Loading directory, and load it from there.  At the start of the package, I will first clear out the loading directory, then scan the original directory for an Excel file, copy it to the loading directory and then load it into SQL.  I suppose I may have to store the file names somewhere so I dont copy the same file into the loading directory in subsequent months, but Im not really sure of the best way to handle that.p  pIve pretty much got everything down except the part that scans the directory for the Excel file and copies it to the loading directory.  Ive taken the majority of my info from a hrefhttpsqlbidev.blogspot.com201008dynamicssispackagetoimportexcel.html relnofollowthis pagea, which again is close to what I want to do but not quite exactly the solution I need.p  pCan anyone get me over the finish line  I cant seem to get the Excel Connection Manager right this is my first time using variables, and I cant figure out how to get the file into the Loading directory.p

Negative 94770 pI recently decided to do some personal C practice by writing simple structures to ease into C development. My first attempt was to write a simple LinkedList but define it as a template class so that it could handle multiple data types. While doing so I did the standard practice of defining the class in a header file and implementing it in a cpp file and then I used make to build it with code686appledarwin11llvmg4.2 GCC 4.2.1code. As far as building the C files which included a codeNode.cppcode, codeLinkedList.cppcode and codeLinkedListIterator.cppcode everything worked fine with no complaints. I then introduce codemain.cppcode which contained the main method and tried to create a codeLinkedListltstringgtcode which worked and then tried to call its length function which I both defined and implementedp  precode Other code here LinkedListltstringgt list  new LinkedListltstringgt cout ltlt Initial length  ltlt listgtlength ltlt endl delete list list  NULL  I had defined NULL to be 0, pre 4.6 compiler so nullptr wasnt available  End the main function codepre  pThis threw an error that no codelengthcode function was defined for the templated codeLinkedListltstringgtcode class and so I began my research where I learned that template classes cannot be defined in the standard headerimplementation format like standard C classes but none of these responses mostly here addressed how to properly handle template classes. So to finish off my personal exercise I dropped the headers and just defined and implemented the classes in the cpp file. Everything worked fine there.p  pThere were some work arounds that supposedly made it possible to separate implementation from definition such as including the cpp file at the end of the header file which failed to work for me or, provided you only want your class to work with specific types, to declare static template versions of your class at the base of your header file likep  precode Define a template class template LinkedListltstringgt template LinkedListltintgt  etc... codepre  pWhich I didnt try it may have worked, and as I was only doing a personal exercise it was perfectly acceptable because this just feels wrong. Why make a template class if you lock it into certain types I realize you could easily lock it into to all the major types you need giving you one definition for several data types but it just doesnt sit right with me to do things this way.p  pstrongTLDRstrong Ultimately my question is, what is the proper way to define a template class and implement a template class in some kind of applicationlibrary other people would be usingp

Negative 94770 pBefore this question is flagged duplicate, please read through.p  pThis has been asked many number of times with no clear answer. Lets say my task is to compute codeunigramcode probability for every word in millions of files. I can emit word counts from mappers and reducers can aggregate the counts for each word. However to compute probabilities, we need total number of words. One way to do would be to send the number of words from each mappers to each reducers with a special key, and sort the keys such that these counts arrive earlier than the individual counts. A reducer can, then simply add up the counts received from mappers to obtain grand total number of words.p  pBut how do I make mappers send counts to all reducersp  pI can find out the total number of reducers from job properties, say it is codencode. Is there not a way to call codeContext.writecode codencode number of times from each mapper and specifying partition number from code0code to coden1code in turn so that data reaches to all the reducersp

Negative 94770 pI am confused with the nearrealtime search ability of Solr and Elasticsearch. The nearrealtime search is argued to be one of the advantages Elasticsearch has over Solr. However, I have read some documents of Solr saying that nearrealtime search also can be done on Solr by using soft commit with the cost of open new searcher. By doing so, the new document is visible in 1 second. In Elasticsearch, the refresh can also make a new document available to search within one second. Did I miss or misunderstand anything Which one does better on real time search  Any answer would be appreciated. Thank you.p

There are some fulltext elements to it but theyve all been dealt with alreadyli liA strongreportstrong has a bunch of info related to search queries. For our purposes, theyre stored separately. They also have an id, which we refer to as codeidReportcodeli liA strongclipstrong is the link between a strongreportstrong and a strongdocumentstrong. It is represented as an codeidcodecodeidReportcode mapping, which can have an optional third field an override for codetonecodeli ul  pThe key snag in our system is that the codetonecode present in the associative link needs to override the codetonecode present on the document for all facets, but cannot replace it. Some reports may see a document as positive, while others see it as neutral, or even positive.p  pI was thinking of storing the report link as a nested field within document. Effectively, a document would then be as followsp  precode     id integer,    tone integer,    reports [        id integer,         tone integer           ]   codepre  pThe key issue with this is whether it is possible, emin one queryem to seamlessly override the tone with anything present in the nested field.

Negative 94770 pIm having some weird behaviour with chrome regarding image resizing when the window is resized.p  pWhen Chrome is snapped fullscreen in Windowsdouble click the window to snap full screen, and I unsnap the window, causing it to revert to whatever previous size it was unsnapped, images are not being scaled properly.p  pFor example, I have the following css code that resizes images to 100 height of the space available, and autos the widthp  precodeimg     height 100     width auto  codepre  pWhen the window is snapped fullscreen it looks fine, the aspect ratios of the images are kept.

Negative 94770 pIm doing a final project for my high school computer science class a really mediocre Pokemon Game and I am having trouble with a switch statement that i made to add a Jlabel with an ImageIcon in it.  p  pWhen i run the driver and it opens this panel it is supposed to Add a random opponent, that is what the switch statement is for and it gives the oppHP variable a value depending on who the opponent is. The bottom PaintComponent sets the background image. The problem is when i do run it no opponent picture shows up its just the background image.p  pkeep in mind im very new to coding so i might not understand the explination, in other words, if its not too much trouble, try to keep it simple.

Negative 94770 pso I have recently been using AutoHotkey and I am a fan as of now but I am running into a couple of issues. I usually compile and run my Java programs from the command terminal in Windows 7. The paths for the compiler codejavaccode and to run the program codejavacode are set properly and run when I open command prompt without using AutoHotkey. But, as soon as I run an AHK script that opens up the command terminal from the same location and try and use the codejavacode command I get the following messagep  blockquote   pError could not open CProgram Filesx86Javajre7libi386jvm.configp blockquote  pI understand that it would not be able to find this location considering I am running Java code1.8.505code but I do not know why the path is not working properly. The stranger part is that when I open a command prompt with AutoHotKey codejavaccode IS still recognized and running the correct version.p  pMy question is this. Why am I able to successfully compile and run java programs when opening up the terminal when I click the codecmd.execode icon but am UNABLE to run java programs when the terminal is opened via a simple AutoHotKey scriptp  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pNote My systems path variable and user path variable are correctly set to codeJAVAHOMEcode which points to the code1.8.505code version  p

Negative 94770 pI would like your input on the followingp  pSince a short while Ive started a job at a new company, which is running processes on a cluster. There is an existing pipeline which is already implemented and roughly does the followingp  ol liBig files are stored per  200 on a harddisk  130gb per fileli liSince there is a disk quota on the cluster, and its very IO intensive to copy,  I have to limit myself to copy only 1 file over at a time.li liA manager java program will create a pull script to pull the big files across the network from NAS to cluster.li liAfter pulling, the analysis pipeline runs on the cluster black box process to me.li liNext, an am I finished script is checking to see if the process is completed on the cluster. If it isnt, the script sleeps for 10mins and checks again, if its finished, the big file gets removed black box script to me.li ol  pSo at the moment Ive made a very simple implementation of a manager program in python, doing this, and once done, execute the next file to copy over and repeat the list of jobs.p  pMy question is, I would like to expand this program, so that it will use 5 maybe more later big files to copy at once, and submit them to the cluster, and only delete and remove a process once its done running.p  pWhen looking for a solution, Ive seen people mentioning using multiple threads or multiprocessing, specifically to use a pool of workers. I have no experience with this yet but one can learn right but I think it will be a viable option to go with in this case. My question would be, how will I setup a pool of 5 workers so that each worker does a series of tasks, and once completed, takes a new big file from the queue and iterates.p
Negative 94770 pI wrote an abstract class p  precodeclass A    enum SegmentationType  SOURCESEGMENT, DESTSEGMENT,               SOURCESEGMENTCONTOUR, DESTSEGMENTCONTOUR    public   virtual const Tamp getSegmentationSegmentationType type 0  codepre  pand derived a classp  precodeclass B  public Altshortgt    public   const shortamp getSegmentationSegmentationType type  codepre  pfrom it. However, the compiler complains BgetSegmentation overriding virtual function return type differs and is not covariant from AgetSegmentation. Since the template parameter T of class B is short and the abstract method returns Tamp, I expected, that the concrete return value must be a reference to a short pointer, hence shortamp. If, for testing purposes, I change the template parameter of B to short and the return value accordingly to shortamp, then everything works fine. p  pI would be thankful, if someone could tell me, why this doesnt work.p

Negative 94770 pI have an application written in Delphi 5, which runs fine on most windows computers.p  pHowever, occasionally the program begins to load you can see it in task manager, uses about 2.53 MB of memory, but then stalls for a number of minutes, sometimes hours.p  pIf you leave it long enough, the formshow event will eventually occur and the application window will pop up, but it seems like some other application or windows setting is preventing it from initially using all the memory it needs to run approx. 3540 MB.p  pAlso,  on some of my clients workstations, if they have MS Outlook running, they can close it and my application will pop up.

Negative 94770 pI have a vagrant server based off Laravel Homestead for testing my Laravel sites locally for the most part it runs great. However, recently, I have been having problems where it will just halt for anything from a few minutes typical to hours rare. This happens every 15 minutes or so. To the point where if Im typing in the ssh connection it will just stop. Then when I check back a few minutes later, what I had been typing is now there. This isnt just SSH and pages stop loading, and vagrant commands including rsync and even halt fail.p  pThis is vanilla Homestead, except for I changed the mapping to be via rsync manual, I run the rsync command whenever I want to update the server. The reason for this was because I was getting 30second or so load times for webpages and after research and trying rsync this helped massively for this. Also, I have since the problem tried giving it access to all 4 cpus. I am running this on a macbook air 2013 if this is important. It has been running fine for the past 2 months. The vagrant server is running with 2048MB of memory and I have 15GB of disk space free.p  pThis is a very frustrating problem as it slows down development massively.p  pstrongeditstrong This seems to happen most frequently but not exclusively when using the mysql command line over sshp

Negative 94770 pI ask this question because of release of new JetBrains product CLion.

Because function should not have  at the end even if it return enum structure. p  pMy question is if it is good practise to declare function as returning enum or shoud I always declare enum asp  precodetypedef enum someenum  AnEnum  codepre  pand then use it as returning type in function declaration.p

Negative 94770 pIm exploring the fields of SQL and relational databases since Im relatively new to database design and I was wondering about how tableobject relationships work. By relationships I mean referencing an id on another table, which is heavily used in frameworks like Laravel with its ORM Eloquent. In the Documents its stated how to create relationships, but not WHY and WHEN What are the benefits or the drawbacks of not doing itp  pstrongSo my question When and why do we need to create relationships between tablesstrongp  pstrongExamplestrong  I was practicing on a Laravel Application for our local indoor FootballSoccer Club which uses multiple tables and what made me confused about the concept. The tablesresources of my app arep  ol liCompetitionsli liTeamsli liMatchesli liLocationsli ol  pTo clear up There are 7 competitions of 12 teams so total 84 teams total who play matches at 3 indoor courts. The matches of every competition are not tied to 1 court, so competition 2B has matches at court 1 and 2 par example.p  pThe target of my app is to show the programschedule, fixtures and rankings of the different competitions. I want to use relationships so I can retrieve all matches played at court 1 or all matches of competition 2A.p  pI presumed the relations to be like thisp  precode1. Competitions gt hasMany Teams,   Teams   gt belongTo Competition 2. Competitions gt hasMany Matches  Matches gt belongTo Competition 3. Location     gt hasMany Matches  Matches gt belongTo Location 4. Matches      gt hasMany Teams    Teams   gt HaveMany Teams codepre  pI created the migrations and the models but I bump into error after error. For example every match has two teams, how to specify this relation And matches, they belong to a competition and as well to a Location so I can query both locations with all their matches and competitions with all their matches.p  pIs this all even possible or does evert table can only have one parentchild relationp  pMaybe someone has some good resources on this matter for beginner to novice for me to learn and grasp the basics of this matter.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 94770 pI have an app that uses Core Data and the Core Data entity stores asset URL for Photos from Apples Photo app, song asset URL for the music file from Apples Music app and lastly, stores a local audio.caf file in the documents directory the entity itself stores the file path to the audio.caf file, not the file itself.p  pThe two questions I have arep  ol liWhat I want to know is, can Core Data and iCloud sync this content across to multiple devices and keep the URL the sameli ol  pI am concerned that after the iCloud does the sync, the asset URL from the previous iPad doesnt exist on the new iPad even if the photos, music and audio files are therep  ol start2 liCan iCloud sync the audio.caf that is stored in my apps Document directory the folder intended for iCloud to sync content. I would assume if it can, it would take some time since the audio.caf file is a audio recording, at 44100 Hz sample rate.li ol  pIm trying to gauge whether using iCloud would work or whether we need to build a server to allow users to keep their content synchronised.p  h2Background Info About My Apph2  pMy app is kind of like a slideshow app that uses photos from the Apple Photos app loaded through ALAssets.p  pThe music for my slideshow is referenced from the Apples Music app.p  pI manually record an audio file in CAF format and store it in the Documents folder within my app this file can be synced I assume, although would take a while.p  pMy app uses Core Data to store the Slideshow but the Slideshow entity only stores references to the files, not the photo and music files themselves.p  pUltimately, I want to have the app open up on another iPad and that iCloud syncs the Slideshow across, keeping the photos and music files in tact. Ideally, I dont want users to have to manually reconstruct their Slideshow, reorder the photo, repick the music etc.p  pIs what Im trying to do possiblep  pDo I resort to iCloud Drive Create some sort of Powerpoint file and back that up That would involve the user manually exporting and importing rightp  pstrongHow does Apples Keynote do itstrongp  pThey seem to use something called iCloud Drive, does the Keynote app stores all the photos and audio with the slides in a binary form, then upload to the iCloud Drive server and hence why other devices can pull down the same content without the slides needing to deal with broken file pathsp

Negative 94770 pI have this programming assignment which is very specific. I need to draw an x and y axis only using loops and if else statements, and the method it is in can only return strings, either of the axis characters, like , or of an empty string, . I have it almost correct, but I cannot understand why the y axis is not printing at x0, but at x 10. I would love a hint about how to fix this, I am sure it is something small I have overlooked.

Negative 94770 pIm using Exchange 2010 and sometimes Ive noticed that the cmdlet getmailboxstatistics returns duplicate mailbox information. For example, if I move a mailbox from one database to other, the cmdlet shows that particular mailbox information for both databases. What are other cases are there when getmailboxstatistics cmdlet will be behaving similarly ie. returning duplicate information.p
Negative 94770 pMy users can set up recurring event schedules to receive certain statistics via email. At the moment I simply store these schedules in the database, for example a user may want codeevery second Monday for 5 monthscode. This is stored as a single record for that user.p  pI then have a script that is runs every 5 minutes that reads this table and calculates if the email needs to be sent by checking the last time the email was sent and what the datetime is now, and checks if it meets the criteriacodeevery second Monday for 5 monthscode.p  pI was thinking another way to accomplish this would be to create a list of the dates when the user first creates the schedule. So when the user chooses codeevery second Monday for 5 monthscode the script calculates all those future dates and stores them for that user. The script that reads the database every 5 minutes would then simply need to check for those records that are not marked as done that have a datetime equalto or before now and send those emails.p  pSo which way would be considered the best way to accomplish this Checking the schedule at intervals and calculating on the fly, or calculating and storing the future dates when the schedule is createdp

Page4.html, until user clicks another link i.e. page6.html, p  pThen only the content in the main div should change from ie. page4.html to page 6.html without any other content reloadingrefreshing on the pagep  pp  pHopefully i have been able to make it clear enough of what im needing to do.p  pThank you.p  pcodep  precode    ltbodygt     ltdiv classcontainergt         ltdiv classheadergtSite nameltdivgt         ltdiv classnavgt             ltulgt                 ltligtlta hrefgtPage1.htmlltagt                  ltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtPage2.htmlltagt             ltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtPage3.htmlltagt              ltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtPage4.htmlltagt              ltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtPage5.htmlltagt              ltligt             ltligtlta hrefgtPage6.htmlltagt              ltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classmaingtThis is the Main Div that will load either page1.html gt page6.html depending on which Nav link the user clicks..

Negative 94770 pIm just beginning with mean.js and getting my feet wet building out a custom article module with a few basic extra properties. Im trying to add a list of tags that are added on the create form via an text input field. As you can see below, this works fine when theyre freshly created. I can see the tags array in the newly created document in the terminal. When I load the edit view the tags field is populated with the elements of the tags array separated by commas. That seems ok. Now I want to simply add new tags after the current ones, separating each new tag with a comma, and have the array updated with the new list. However, after performing the update the tags array elements change to one long string containing all tags.  I had a look at the server side update function but Im not quite sure what to do there to make it work.

I do have access to the proxy server which allows me to curl files from the command line so maybe there is a way to use cpan fromteh or throught the proxy  but that is a nother matter. the matter at hand is that when i parse out thelast file lines or so, I dont get the Names IN MYDEPT that are restricted  and I want it. it gets skipped.p  precodenewguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. cat restricted.html.bak ToDLBANKbigbusiness.com Fromdldeptggsdstmbigbusiness.com Subject Restricted List for 25Nov2014 ContentType texthtml ContentTransferEncoding quotedprint HTMLFILEablegt ltHTMLgt   ltHEADgt      ltSTYLE typetextcssgt      body     fontfamily verdana fontsize 10pt       td       fontsize 8pt verticalalign top       td.cat   color 6699FF  background 666699 textalign right verticalalign bottom height 30       td.ind   width 20pt       td.link        td.desc  color a0a0a0       avisited  color 800080 textdecoration none      ltSTYLEgt  ltTITLEgtTRADESltTITLEgt  ltHEADgtltBODYgtltTABLE width80 border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt       lttrgt          lttd colspan3 aligncentergtNames IN MYDEPT that are restrictedlttdgt       lttrgt       lttrgt         lttdgtltbgtRestriction Codeltbgtlttdgt         lttdgtltbgtCompanyltbgtlttdgt         lttdgtltbgtTickerltbgtlttdgt      lttrgtlttrgtlttdgtRL5lttdgtlttdgtFirst Trust Global Risk Managed InclttdgtlttdgtETPlttdgtlttrgtltfont colorredgtlttrgtlttdgtRLMTlttdgtlttdgtGT Advanced Technologies Inclttdgtlttd nowrapgtGTATQ position only, not in MYDEPTlttdgtlttrgtltfontgtltTABLEgtltBODYltHTMLgtnewguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. cat parserestrict2 usrbinperl use strict use warnings  my restrictcodes  qwRL3 RL5 RL5H RL6 REGM RAF RLMT RTCA RTCAH RTCB RTCBH RTCI RTCIH RLSI RLHK RLJP RPROP RLCB RLCS RLBZ RLBZH RLSUS my restdir  homenewguyheyhitBANKrestricted. my restrictfile  restricted.html.bak  open my fhrestcodes, lt, restdirrestrictfile or die cannot load    while ltfhrestcodesgt      next unless   mNames     my lines  ltfhrestcodesgt       foreachlines      std g      slt[gt]gt g      foreach restrictrestrictcodes          srestrictnrestrictg              print       sleep 1         print n  codepre  pThese are the results that I get They are Ok but I would like to format them and i do not know how.p  precodenewguecasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. cat parserestrictC newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. .parserestrict2             Restriction Code           Company           Ticker  RL5  First Trust Global Risk Managed Inc  ETP RLMT  GT Advanced Technologies Inc  GTATQ position only, not in MYDEPT newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. newguycasper0170fooheyhitBANKrestricted. codepre  pWould there be any way possible to get the lines in this kind of format.p  precodeNames IN MYDEPT that are restricted  Restriction Code Company                              Ticker RL5              First Trust Global Risk Managed Inc  ETP RLMT             GT Advanced Technologies Inc         GTATQ position only, not in MYDEPT codepre

But when we are running the automation suite the controls are not getting recognized in an inconsistent manner. Sometimes the same control it is able to recognize, sometimes it doesnt.  Just curios to known is this inconsistency is because of framework up gradation or some other issue.

If any of the field changes, I need to consider it as a new version of the object and all this need to be audited as well. Now I have two optionsp  p1.

There are actually quite a number of levels of services under the toplevel, not just the single Aux A amp B servicelayer shown.

Negative 94770 pI am currently working out an admin interface with a Live Preview and I am still not 100 on how to structure it properly.p  pMy page basically consists out of two parts. The strongAdmin Interfacestrong and the strongLive Previewstrong. Obviously, the Admin Interface fills some variables with data and the Live Preview displays this. p  pTherefore, the Admin Interface needs to bind variables, that the Live Preview will bind for reading.p  pFurthermore, the Live Preview in the end if possible should be reused as the final product that displays a set of information. All it does is display a single JSON file that is received from the server when in product mode and in case of the Live Preview it will need to update the data Live as its edited.p  pemOne more note Both, the Live Preview and the Admin Interface consist of elements like directives again and parts of the Admin Interface need to be loaded dynamically by having a user add a page with a certain type of content.emp  pAfter researching how modules are handled I came up with the followingp  ul liLive Preview is a Moduleli liAdmin Interface is a Moduleli liMy page includes both modulesli ul  pBoth of them should be connected to something central that provides the ability of editing the data bound variables and reading the data so its updated live.p  pIdeally, this would be a service, so later on when loading the Live Preview as an actual product, can just use the same kind of service which in this case provides the information from our Database instead of a variable in its scope.p  pIs this a good approach Is there a way to have a service that on the one hand side can be edited lively like in a two way binding so that my live preview can also pick it up Is there something I can use instead of the services, like a controller How should I go on about thisp

Negative 94770 pI have a app on my android device that runs as a codesystemprocesscode. p  pIts doing codeUSBcode communication in codeJNI layercode, with a full screen codeUIcode to show images.p  pThe problem is, the activity becomes invisible not long after start up.

Negative 94770 pI have an Android fragment in which contains a Vertical LinearLayout with two layouts inside it Another inner Vertical LinearLayout which takes at least half of the screen and a ListView which shows a number of smaller Views. A good way to think about it is something like a facebook post along with several comments showing below it.p  pThe problem I am facing is that the the inner LinearLayout is not scrollable and therefore parts of the ListView stays outside of the screen and there is no way to scroll the screen up to see the entire ListView the inner layout could possibly take up the entire screen. Placing the entire layout inside a ScrollView is also known to be a bad practice.p  pI know one solution is to make the entire layout to be a ListView with the first cell to be the inner LinearLayout, followed by the cells from the original ListView. That however has its own issues It is harder to recycle the views in the ListView, and generally I also see it as a bad practice where one cell has a different behavior from all other cells in the ListView.p  pIs there a better solution to this I can imagine this is a typical problem and I hope to find a better solution than above.p

Also after recording I can hear only my voice. This suggests that the microphone is blocked by my app.brstrongCase 2strong If I try to record during Voip session then I get codeEMediaRecorder start failed 38code error. brI dont have any problem recording phone calls. Another thing which I observed is in strongemKitkatemstrong the error doesnt occur during Voip session and recording is successful but I am unable to hear recipient voice.

Negative 94770 pIm trying to blend two textures together. One is a background image opaque and the other one is an overlay which is semitransparent.p  pIt took me a lot of trial and error to make my underlayoverlay work properly and now that it works there are still some OpenTKGL calls I need and I dont know why. More specifically thisp  precodeGL.Color40.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 codepre  pIn my code Im drawing the underlay withp  precodeGL.TexEnvTextureEnvTarget.TextureEnv, TextureEnvParameter.TextureEnvMode, floatTextureEnvMode.Replace codepre  pand the overlay withp  precodeGL.TexEnvTextureEnvTarget.TextureEnv, TextureEnvParameter.TextureEnvMode, floatTextureEnvMode.Blend codepre  pSome parts of the overlay have different alpha values so that they are more or less transparent. It seems like the alpha set with GL.Color4 is multiplied with the alpha from my overlay, which is nice since I can then make the overlay more or less transparent without having to modify the alpha in the texture.The thing is, I looked at the equations here a hrefhttpswww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanhtmlglBlendFunc.xhtml relnofollowhttpswww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanhtmlglBlendFunc.xhtmlap  pand found nowhere where this GL.Color4 value is used in the equation. Also, if I  call this insteadp  precodeGL.Color41.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 codepre  pthen my overlay becomes fully opaque and all white. Again, something I cant explain, hence my question, how does the color set with GL.Color4 affects the alpha blending p  pI built a relatively small example using one of OpenTKs tutorial showing my issue by drawing a red underlay with a semitransparent blue overlay, so heres the full sourcep  precodeusing System using System.Drawing using OpenTK using OpenTK.Graphics using OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL

Negative 94770 pToday I experienced a strange behaviour while writing some CC code and I was wondering what the explanation is.p  pHere are two code snippets showing the same function, the first one has the static array char comp[BUFFLEN] declared outside the function while for the second one it is declared inside the function. BUFFLEN was defined with size 1024. The odd behaviour I am referring to is this the first function runs perfectly and provides the expected output while the second one crushes with a segfault.  I know where the mistake is  I did not allocate memory for k before copying obviously, after fixing, both variants work well, yet I was hoping someone could tell me what happened and why I didt get an error for the first one.

I was assuming this to be very simple, but am having trouble coming up with a query that would view the table as it was at time T.p  pIt would also obviously be nice if the query were somewhat efficient p

Negative 94770 pSearching for answer for a long period, but getting no answer. I am thinking to host my application in Heroku using work dynos. My application would call a number of API calls, that might cross the API call limit per user in Heroku. Moreover the communicated request and response data may also cross the cache limit. As I can develop both heroku app and the API, I need to know system information of a dyno, at the level of API calls. In other words, I need to know when an API is called, how long does it take to return, how much memory is used during sending a request and getting a response. How can I know all these informations What are the commands And is there any limitation to know these in demo versionp

Negative 94770 pAfter hours spent on this subject and also dozens of pages visited i am forced to ask for a help. I have seen a lot of posts on this subject, but i couldnt fix problem i get.p  pBasically, i want to do very simple thing load assembly from my folder to application. p  hr  pHere is question in short all other details are explained in rest of text I want to use Assembly.LoadFrom method to load my assembly same assembly file is referenced with project, but with CopyLocal false, but although assembly is loaded when method using it is invoked, program tries to load assembly from default locations. If it is found, then 2 same assemblies are loaded, and program uses last one, if it is not found then FileNotFoundException is raised. But, when i use same idea in Autocad plugin, everything works and exception is not raised, although files are not found.p  hr  pI have test solution with 2 simple projects TestExe console application and TestDlldll library. I want to use types from TestDll in TestExe so ive added reference to TestDlli am not referencing TestDll project, but file on specified location, but i want to load TestDll manually in the runtime. Why this is needed is explained at the end of text, with Autocad example.p  pAs far as i understand, Assembly.LoadFrom method can be used for this purpose. So basic idea is Load TestDll before method in TestExe is using it, so when method is called we have already loaded assembly. This way, whether referenced dll exists in default directories or not, we already have assembly loaded and it is going to be used.p  pFrom MSDNp  blockquote   pIf an assembly with the same identity is already loaded, LoadFrom returns the loaded assembly even if a different path was specified.p blockquote  pSo i understand that if i load dll once, every next load of same assembly also from other location will know that it is already added, so first one will be used.p  hr  pProject TestExep  precodeFile Program.cs using System namespace TestExe      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      Console.WriteLinenew ClassExe.ExeMethod                    File ClassExe.cs namespace TestExe      class ClassExe              public string ExeMethod                      return new TestDll.ClassDll.DllMethod                codepre  pProject TestDllp  precodeusing System.Reflection  namespace TestDll      public class ClassDll              public string DllMethod                      return Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.Location                codepre  hr  pAs you can see, task is simple display location of called assembly.p  pLets say TestDll.dll is copied to application folder ExternTestDll.dll.p  pIf i set property CopyLocal false of reference to TestDll in TestExe project, program fails with FileNotFoundException. 1 Is it because assembly is  searched only in default directories application dir and TestDllTestDll.dllp  pThen i tried to load assembly manually, before using itp  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args              Assembly.LoadFromExternTestDll.dll         Console.WriteLinenew ClassExe.ExeMethod      codepre  pBut i get same FileNotFoundException, although TestDll has been loaded a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwCU9h.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwCU9h.jpg altenter image description hereap  pWhen i set attribute CopyLocal true, then program works. But, it loads TestDll.dll again, from default location, and ignores assembly which is already loaded. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7MCkF.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7MCkF.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThe only way i managed program to work how i wanted to be used assembly ExternTestDll.dll is with using AppDomain.AssemblyResolve event.p  hr  pI have Autocad plugin which uses 10 different dlls, from different solutions. So i have plugin.dll which references 10 dll files across Documents folder, and set CopyLocal true. But, when deployed to customer, i keep only plugin.dll in application folder, and all other dlls are in Libraries subdirectory. In static constructor of plugin class, i put Assembly.LoadFrom to be loaded from Libraries subdirectory, and everything works fine.p  pSorry for long post but i wanted to explain it with details.p  pAnd thanks for any feedback  p
Negative 94770 pI have defined the clientside click event for a link in the codebehind of an ASP.Net page.

Negative 94770 pI have a UserForm where one of my ComboBoxs can have different values depending on other variables that the user has selected. Rather than update the contents of a single ComboBox every time the user makes a change, I have created two ComboBoxs and simply set the appropriate one as visible. These two ComboBoxs have the names width1cb and width2cb respectively.p  pI have created a helper function to return the currently active ComboBox so that other pieces of my code can use it. Here is the helper functionp  precodeFunction myGetActiveByVal control As String As ComboBox If control  width Then     If width1cb.Visible  True Then         Set myGetActive  Me.width1cb     ElseIf width2cb.Visible  True Then         Set myGetActive  Me.width2cb     Else         Set myGetActive  Nothing     End If End If End Function codepre  pUnfortunately, this function is not functioning as expected. I have another line of codep  precodeSet currentWidth  myGetActivewidth currentWidth.Value  5 codepre  pwhich fails on the second line. I cannot figure out what I am doing incorrectly here  my best guess is that I am somehow not returning the actual combobox instance in my helper function but instead some sort of copy, but in my research I have not been able to figure out the correct way to accomplish this. Does any one know how I can make this function work as expectedp  pUpdate Debugging efforts I have taken including stepping through the code linebyline and putting a watch within the myGetActive function on both the width1cb and the myGetActive variables. What I find is that the myGetActive variable gets set to type ComboBoxCombobox while the width1cb is ObjectCombobox. Whats more, the context for width1cb is InputWindow.UserFormInitialize while the context for the myGetActive is InputWindow.myGetActive. The function does exit without any errors though.p

Negative 94770 pThe a hrefhttpsazure.microsoft.comenusdocumentationarticleseventhubsoverview relnofollowAzure Event Hubs overviewa article states the followingp  blockquote   pThe number of partitions is specified at the Event Hub creation time   and must be between 8 and 32. Partitions are a data organization   mechanism and are more related to the degree of downstream parallelism   required in consuming applications than to Event Hubs throughput. This   makes the choice of the number of partitions in an Event Hub directly   related to the number of concurrent readers you expect to have. After   Event Hub creation, the partition count is not changeable you should   consider this number in terms of longterm expected scale. You can   increase the 32 partition limit by contacting the Azure Service Bus   team.p blockquote  pSince you cannot change the number of partitions on your event hub after initial creation, why not just always configure it to the maximum number of partitions, 32 I do not see any a hrefhttpazure.microsoft.comenuspricingdetailseventhubs relnofollowpricinga implications in doing this. Is there some performance trade offp  pAlso, as another side note, I appear to be able to create an event hub with less than 8 partitions. The article says it must be between 832.

Negative 94770 pI am trying to dynamically format the labels on my SSRS charts based on the underlying value. Im trying to do this in two scenarios, one to format dates as ordinals and another to choose the appropriate number of decimal places based on actual values present. However, when I use the expression editor with an expression something like this...p  precodeIIFMAXABSFields[axisfield].Valuelt2, 0.0,0 codepre  p...the Fields[axisfield].Value is emalwaysem returning the first value from the dataset, meaning, in this example, if the first value is less than two, the labels will be formatted with one decimal place, even if it is the only one less than two. So the MAX function is essentially irrelevant. p  pThat example is attempting to set the overall formatting based on the largest data point in the series, in this next one Im trying to format each label separately to get Ordinal dates i.e. 1st, 2nd, etc, and yes, this formula is incomplete it doesnt need to be to illustrate the problemp  precodeddIIFDatePartd, Fieldsdate.Value1,st ,IIFDatePartd, Fieldsdate.Value2,nd ,IIFDatePartd, Fieldsdate.Value3,rd ,th codepre  pThis will give 1st, 2st, 3st and so on, as the first row in the dataset is for the first.p  pSo, my question is, how do I get round this and, in the first example get the true maximum, and in the second reference the actual value being formattedp  pThanksp

Negative 94770 pI have a problem. When i start working with RichTextBox it is empty I cannot change format to Bold. I try to type CTRLB but after I typed something the text is normal not bold.p  pThe text only changes format when I type something before. This happens again when I SelectAll and Clear all Content.p  pIs it bug in RichTextBox, or I can do something with it.p  pBest Regards, alexiejp
