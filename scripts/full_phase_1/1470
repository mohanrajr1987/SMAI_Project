Positive 1470 pIm doing some basic data processing stuff with Stata. However, I get stuck on how to keep the observations of the other variables matching, after modifying a variables value label.  p  pFor example, say, I have the raw dataset as followsp  precode   var1   var2   var3     US    1000    15   China    500    20     UK     800    10 codepre  pThe emvar1em is a string variable. I need to convert it into a numeric one. So I typed p  precode   encode var1, gencountry     where the new variable country is numeric codepre  pThe variables that I want for future work are emvar2em, emvar3em and emcountryem. p  pWhen the new variable is generated, it automatically has a value label. To be specific, if I click on US in the column of emcountryem, it shows 3 in the cell on top of the column.p  precode   var1   var2   var3  country     US    1000    15     US   China    500    20   China     UK     800    10     UK codepre  pSo far its good. I mean for each row the observations match. p  pHowever, this automatically generated value label is not exactly what I want. What I need is to make 1 denote UK, 2 for US and 3 for China. So I modified it byp  precode     label define country 1 UK 2 US 3 China, modify codepre  pAs shown below, I get the value labels that I want. Like, a click on China gives me 3.  p  precode     var1   var2   var3  country       US    1000    15    China     China    500    20     UK       UK     800    10     US codepre  pBut the point is, as you may already notice, the order of the observations for emcountryem is arranged alphabetically. It makes the corresponding values of emvar2em and emvar3em for each country to be wrong. p  pThat is exactly where I could not get through. Since the columns that I finally need are emvar2em, emvar3em and emcountryem, Id like to have each country with its corresponding values of emvar2em, emvar3em and as well the customized value labels. p  pI tried emsortem, emorderem and a couple of commands but none gave me the result. I dont know what command I should use or theres something wrong in my earlier work. p

Anyhow, I use this code to generate the plotp  precode Plotting  Showing interpolation of randomization plt.imshowM[257,257].T, originlower,interpolationnearest,cmapBlues, normmc.Normalizevmin0,vmaxM.max titlestringfBm Inverse FFT on Spectral Synthesis subtitlestringLattice size 256x256  H0.8  dimf1.2  Ref Saupe, 1988  Event 50 mmh, 15 min plt.suptitletitlestring, y0.99, fontsize17 plt.titlesubtitlestring, fontsize9 plt.show   Makes a custom list of tick mark intervals for color bar assumes minimum is always zero numberOfTicks  5 ticksListIncrement  M.maxnumberOfTicks ticksList  [] for i in rangenumberOfTicks1     ticksList.appendticksListIncrement  i   cbplt.colorbarorientationhorizontal, format0.2f, ticksticksList  cb.setlabelWater depth [m]  plt.show plt.xlim0, 255 plt.xlabelEasting Cells  plt.ylim255, 0 plt.ylabelNorthing Cells codepre  pNow, being my subtitle too long 3rd line of code in the excerpt reported here, it interferes with the Y axis ticks, and I dont want this. Instead, some of the information reported in the subtitle I would like to be rerouted to a line of text to be placed at the bottom center of the image, under the colorbar label. How can this be done with matplotlib p  pSorry for not being able to attach an image. Thanks.p
Positive 1470 pI wrote a simple program to monitor my ping. Im currently using codeNumberAxiscode with auto ranging, and after each ping, I add the new data at the end, remove the first one and increment codetotalCountcode variable for X axis position. p  pI would like the X axis label to eitherp  ul lishow time elapsed since start. So for example, the label for 1100th ping at 0.25s ping intervals would be code4m 35scodeli lishow time since the ping. This would require the labels to remain static not move with the plot and be in reversed order.li ul  pIs either of these two preferably 1st possible to implement I suppose I would have to use codeCategoryAxiscode for this, but Im not sure how to create unlimited number of categories and choose to show only full minutes. Is it possible to keep the codeNumberAxiscode for easier use with incoming data and just change the label text formatting I already have a method that converts seconds to code00h 00m 00scode format.p  pAlso another thing, I think related to auto ranging, the chart doesnt refresh after every input, but only once it exceeds 10 of given range. So for 1000 range as in the picture, it will draw 100 new pings, and then move everything 100 positions to the left. Can I change it somehow to move after just 1 pingp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comiJ3g0.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiJ3g0.jpg altpingap  pNot sure if relevant, but Ill post the code p

Positive 1470 pI am creating a VB.net program where kids can answer exercises on multiplication. I have a problem cause my professor wants me to print the results of the exercises where the kids answer 10 randomized multiplication problems . the summary which he wants me to create should contain the questions, the kids answer to every question, and if it is wrong, the correct answer should also be prompted. the problem is, the questions are randomly generated integers displayed at the same label control, how am I gonna call every question if thats the case well, thats just the first problem. my second problem is about radio buttons, see, there are three difficulty levels, the easy, medium, and hard level. every difficulty level has 10 questions. what I want to happen is that when a kid finishes answering one level, the radiobutton that corresponds to it should be disabled. heres the picture for my problem to make sense to you .  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9LUJd.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9LUJd.png altmultiplication exerciseap  pand the summary must be contained on a different form.p

Positive 1470 pI am having some serious trouble getting my multiline label to show all of its lines. Often, the last line of the label simply does not appear, but it is apparent that the dynamically calculated cell height has taken in to account that it should have appeared, leaving around the appropriate amount of white space left over in my cell. p  pThe affected label can display 17 lines depending on the data. I have played around with many various constraints to try and get it to display but regardless of what is on the last line, it just wont display. p  pThe weird thing is, sometimes it will display when I segue in to the VC, but then when I use the segmented controller inside the VC to display different data and then go back again, the last line will again not display. The opposite happens frequently too last line of label cutting off when I segue in to the VC, but then using the segmented controller inside the VC to change the displayed data and then go back, it will then display fine.p  pThings I have ensured The label is set to word wrap, has line count of 0, has a height greater than or equal to the height of one of its lines, its resistance and vertical content hugging is set to the highest of anything in the cell, and the width is set appropriately. p  pThe below code is how I determine how many lines the label will havep  precodelet descString  NSMutableAttributedString  let bountyStart  NSMutableAttributedStringstring Bounty , attributes [NSFontAttributeName  UIFont.boldSystemFontOfSize15] let bountyDesc  NSMutableAttributedStringstring bounty.description descString.appendAttributedStringbountyStart descString.appendAttributedStringbountyDesc  let bLine  NSMutableAttributedStringstring nn, attributes [NSFontAttributeName  UIFont.systemFontOfSize2] descString.appendAttributedStringbLine  if bounty.turtles  0.0     let turtleStart  NSMutableAttributedStringstring Your turtle count      let turtleAmount  NSMutableAttributedStringstring bounty.turtleCount.description     descString.appendAttributedStringturtleStart     descString.appendAttributedStringturtleAmount  descriptionLabel.attributedText  descString codepre  pIn the screen shot below, you can see that the height of the cell is being calculated appropriately but for some reason, the last line of the label just refuses to show.

Negative 1470 pIm trying to optimize a piece of software which is basically running millions of tests. These tests are generated in such a way that there can be some repetitions. Of course, I dont want to spend time running tests which I already ran if I can avoid it efficiently.p  pSo, Im thinking about using a Bloom filter to store the tests which have been already ran. However, the Bloom filter errs on the unsafe side for me. It gives false positives. That is, it may report that Ive ran a test which I havent. Although this could be acceptable in the scenario Im working on, I was wondering if theres an equivalent to a Bloom filter, but erring on the opposite side, that is, only giving false negatives.p  pIve skimmed through the literature without any luck.p

Negative 1470 pSo, Ive read all the QampAs here on SO regarding the subject of whether or not to expose IQueryable to the rest of your project or not see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions164342shouldrepositoriesimplementiqueryabletherea, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions741490repositorypatternpocosoriqueryableherea, and Ive ultimately decided that I dont want to expose IQueryable to anything but my Model.  Because IQueryable is tied to certain persistence implementations I dont like the idea of locking myself into this.  Similarly, Im not sure how good I feel about classes further down the call chain modifying the actual query that arent in the repository. p  pSo, does anyone have any suggestions for how to write a clean and concise Repository without doing this  One problem I see, is my Repository will blow up from a ton of methods for various things I need to filter my query off of.p  pHaving a bunch ofp  precodeIEnumerable GetProductsSinceDateDateTime date   IEnumberable GetProductsByNamestring name   IEnumberable GetProductsByIDint ID codepre  pIf I was allowing IQueryable to be passed around I could easily have a generic repository that looked likep  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      T GetByIdint id     IQueryableltTgt GetAll     void InsertOnSubmitT entity     void DeleteOnSubmitT entity     void SubmitChanges  codepre  pHowever, if you arent using IQueryable then methods like GetAll arent really practical since lazy evaluation wont be taking place down the line.  I dont want to return 10,000 records only to use 10 of them later.p  pWhat is the answer here  In a hrefhttpblog.wekeroad.commvcstorefrontConerys MVC Storefronta he created another layer called the Service layer which received IQueryable results from the respository and was responsible for applying various filters.  p  pIs this what I should do, or something similar  Have my repository return IQueryable but restrict access to it by hiding it behind a bunch of filter classes like GetProductByName, which will return a concrete type like IList or IEnumerablep

Negative 1470 pOkay, the title is not saying too much, sorry. Essentially its an Architecture Question about an Application that can have multiple database backends Well, Database is loosely used here as it can mean anything from MSSQL to XML Files to an IList in Memory, essentially involving the Repository Pattern.p  pI have a set of POCOs that essentially just serve as Data Transfer object DTOs and therefore do nothing except carry data. Unfortunately, I am seeing myself in the need to decorate them with Attributes i.e. for use with certain ORMs or even for use with the XmlSerializer. That means that they are now somewhat bound to the database layer and in my opinion not simple POCOs anymore.p  pFrom what I see, I would now have to duplicate these DTOClasses, so that I have one DatabaseSpecific class with Attributes and whatever I need, and a second version that is generic through my application. My Model would then have to convert them which is where something like a hrefhttpwww.codeplex.comAutoMapper relnofollowAutoMappera could be usedp  pIt just still feels weird as I am essentially duplicating all my DTO Classes, yet the existence of ObjectToObject mappers seems to indicate that this is perfectly fine. Also, this seems to copy the ADO.net Approach whereas there is a Generic Part down to the DataSet and a DatabaseSpecific part.p  pIs that correct Or is there a different approachp

Negative 1470 precode[ad][ad][ad] codepre  pIm using the above regex in jquery where I call it on every keypress on an input field. It works exactly as intended which is a problem because Im running a dynamic update too. You can tell for yourself what it does, but the point here is the underscore codecode. Its meant to be followed by a character codeadcode and therefore cannot be the last thing the user types. This is my problem. p  pSince the regex is being checked against something thats being typed in progress, its not being checked against the final version. With every keypress, I check the validity of the regex, and if no match, I remove the offending character instantly, the user cant get to see it, it doesnt register in the input field. This means that if the user types codesomecode, the dynamic correction kicks in and takes it back to codesomecode even if the user is in the middle of typing a continuation. p  pIs there any way I can slow down the keypress or any other solution in this casep
Negative 1470 pMy domain objects support custom fields that are stored in such a way that requires metadata and logic to be applied before their values can be stored and retrieved.  p  pI already have a Custom Field Repository that handles the persistence of custom fields, and I dont want to try to recreate that logic in NHibernate mappings.p  pI would however like to support lazy loading of my custom fields.  It would be nice if I could somehow trick the proxy into calling my dedicated repository for loading and saving rather than going through the NHibernate engine.  p  pOne way I solved this problem was to implement an interceptor which worked, but I took a performance hit when loading large amounts of data, because the dedicated repository was called each time an entity was loaded.  It would be nice instead, if those calls to load custom fields were done lazily  From what I understand lazy loading cannot be done in an interceptor.p  pI have looked into implementing a custom user type IUserType and IUserCollectionType, but the documentation is very limited, and I want to learn if it is even possible to do what I want before I go down the path of trying.p  pHere is an example of one of my domain objectsp  precodepublic class ContactEntity  ICustomFieldContainer        public long ContactId  get set        public String FirstName  get set        public String LastName  get set          region ICustomFieldContainer Members         public ListltCustomFieldEntitygt CustomFields  get set          endregion   codepre

Negative 1470 pPreface I dont have experience with rules engines, building rules, modeling rules, implementing data structures for rules, or whatnot. Therefore, I dont know what Im doing or if what I attempted below is way off base.p  pIm trying to figure out how to store and process the following hypothetical scenario. To simplify my problem, say that I have a type of game where a user purchases an object, where there could be 1000s of possible objects, and the objects must be purchased in a specified sequence and only in certain groups. For example, say Im the user and I want to purchase object F. Before I can purchase object F, I must have previously purchased object A OR B AND C. I cannot buy F and A at the same time, nor F and B,C. They must be in the sequence the rule specifies. A first, then F later. Or, B,C first, then F later. Im not concerned right now with the span of time between purchases, or any other characteristics of the user, just that they are the correct sequence for now. p  pWhat is the best way to store this information for potentially thousands of objects that allows me to read in the rules for the object being purchased, and then check it against the users previous purchase history p  pIve attempted this, but Im stuck at trying to implement the groupings such as A OR B AND C. I would like to store the rules in a database where I have these tablesp  precode Objects     IDint,Descriptionchar   ObjectPurchRules     ObjectIDint,ReqirementObjectIDint,OperatorRulechar,Sequenceint codepre  pBut obviously as you process through the results, without the grouping, you get the wrong answer. I would like to avoid excessive string parsing if possible . One object could have an unknown number of previous required purchases. SQL or psuedocode snippets for processing the rules would be appreciated. p

Negative 1470 pI have a managed object in a c dll that maintains an anonymous integer handle to an unmanaged object in a c dll. Inside the c dll, the anonymous integer is used in an stdmap to retrieve an unmanaged c object. Through this mechanism, I can maintain a loose association between a managed and unmanaged object using an anonymous integer handle.p  pIn the finalize method destructor of the managed object I have a call into the unmanaged dll to delete the unmanaged object.p  pAll is well as the c program runs, but I have a problem when the program exits. Becuase I have no control on the order of delete operations on the managed side, the unmanaged dll is deleted from memory BEFORE any managed object. Thus when the managed objects destructor is called which in turn calls the unmanaged destructor [at least indirectly], the unmanaged object has already been deleted and the program crashes.p  pSo how can I safely delete a unmanaged object in an external c dll that is associated with a managed object in a c program.p  pThanksp  pAndrewp

Negative 1470 pI built a small query tool for Oracle using OracleCommand and OracleDataAdapter. Users just input a full query no parameters, execute and the results are shown in a datagridview. So far so good, although I tried an invalid query, e.g.p  precodeSELECT  FROM mytable WHERE dateColumn  1JAN10 codepre  pThis query is not valid SQL for Oracle. You have to use the todate function to compare with date literals. SQL developer also rejects it, but somehow my query tool just works. Does that mean my OracleCommand is a bit of a wizard here or am I doing something wrong Also is there a way to omit this behavior because the purpose of the tool is testing queries, which should work always...p  pThanksp

Negative 1470 pI have been lately reading a lot on memory allocation schemes in java, and there have been many doubts as I have been reading from various sources. I have collected my concepts, and I need you people to go through all of the points and comment on them. I came to know that memory allocation is JVM specific, so I must say beforehand, that my question is Sun specific.p  ol liClasses loaded by the classloaders go in a special area on heap  Permanent Generationli liAll the information related to a class like name of the class, Object arrays asscociated with the class, internal objects used by JVM like javalangObject and optimization information goes into the Permanent Generation area.li liAll the static member variables are kept on the Permanent Genration area again.li liObjects go on a different heap  Young generationli liThere is only one copy of each method per class, be the method static or nonstatic. That copy is put in the Permanent Generation area. For nonstatic methods, all the parameters and local variables go onto the stack  and whenever there is a concrete invocation of that method, we get a new stackframe associated with it. I am not sure where are the local variables of a static method are stored. Are they on the heap of Permanent Genration  Or just their reference is stored in the Permanent Generation area, and the actual copy is somewhere else Where li liI am also unsure where does the return type of a method get stored.li liIf the objects in the young generation nees to use a static memberin the permanent generation, they are given a reference to the static member ampamp they are given enough memory space to store the return type of the method,etc.li ol  pThank you for going through this p

Negative 1470 pIn our solution EF4, WCF, MVC2, we have a very large amount of T4 code generation going on, FAR beyond the EF4 stuff. In fact, we even generate a large number of services as well. Since we can predict this behavior very easily otherwise we couldnt generate the code, that means we can even predict many tests for this generated code. As such, we also generate a large number of nUnit tests.p  pThinking about doing this sounds easy as long as you can get the generated code, services, tests, and all templates figured out. Thats the hard part and weve now mastered this. However, now that were growing our team and getting some additional nonconformities added to the equation, were now starting to learn that there are some problems that come with this. Specifically, what test runners work nicely with these testsp  pstrongSo this brings us to my questionstrong emstrongIs there a resource that lists what common test runners support this scenarioemstrongp  pWhat weve seen is that pretty much all tests work when you run the specific test or classs tests. When running all tests within a folder, this usually results in 0 tests being ran. When running all tests within a project or solution, this varies depending on the test runner ReSharper skips them while TestDriven.net runs them.p  pHelp would be appreciated so we dont have to do all the discovery work ourselves to identify what test runners we can and cannot work with, and in what ways.p  hr  pUltimately, I suspect the problem lays on the method that a test runner goes to discover the tests within a certain context folder vs project. It seems that since the generated .cs file actually exists as a child to the .tt file rather than the folder causes a problem in this discovery algorithm. If this is the case, I suspect I should be in contact with the product teams that I wish to work with and request that they support this scenario. Unfortunately, I suspect this is the REAL answer. p
Negative 1470 pI need to make a file that contains a hierarchical dataset. The dataset in question is a filesystem listing directory names, file namesizes in each directory, subdirectories, ....p  pMy first instinct was to use Json and flatten the hierarchy using paths so the parser doesnt have to recurse so much. As seen in the example below, each entry is a path , child01, child01gchild01,... and its files.p  precode     entries     [                      path,             files             [                 nameFile1, size1024,                 nameFile2, size1024             ]         ,                      pathchild01,             files             [                 nameFile1, size1024,                 nameFile2, size1024             ]         ,                      pathchild01gchild01,             files             [                 nameFile1, size1024,                 nameFile2, size1024             ]         ,                      pathchild02,             files             [                 nameFile1, size1024,                 nameFile2, size1024             ]              ]  codepre  pThen I thought that repeating the keys over and over name, size for each file kind of sucks. So I found this article about how to use Json as if it were a database  a hrefhttppeter.michaux.caarticlesjsondbacompressedjsonformat relnofollowhttppeter.michaux.caarticlesjsondbacompressedjsonformatap  pUsing that technique Id have a Json table like Entry with columns Id, ParentId, EntryType, Name, FileSize where EntryType would be 0 for Directory and 1 for File.p  pSo, at this point, Im wondering if sqlite would be a better choice. Im thinking that the file size would be a LOT smaller than a Json file, but it might only be negligible if I use JsonDBcompressed format from the article. Besides size, are there any other advantages that you can think ofp

Negative 1470 pIm currently trying to build a webbase management interface for a cluster of linux servers running a special service. The idea being that the management website can RPC the clusters to gather information, perform configuration tasks, etc.p  pIve got an XMLRPC Python Server script up and running, and Ive written a basic XMLRPC Client in PHP. It all works, but Im having some serious issues trying to get consistent responses from method calls  Sometimes I get an XML array to nth depth based on the verbosity of the output of the command I run, sometimes its a XML struct, and sometimes its just a plain old value. Then Ive got errors to deal with  It seems the XMLRPC standard has a Fault struct with faultCode and faultString values it responds with, which is great because thats tidy and I can pull that data out via the named key in the XML. But you only get that struct if error is from the shell itself For example if the called command had a bad argument, whereas an error coming from the command has to be just a normal XML response.p  pHow can I possibly write a robust webservice around what appears to be such varied replies from the XMLRPC server What Id really like to do is have the exact same XML struct reply back every time with the same Keys returnCode 0success, 1error, returnValues.p  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 1470 pIm calling a generic method in some of my properties to fill proxy classes made by NHibernate although this is not important right nowp  pTo do this i want he type of the Property and pass this to a method which does its magic, some of these properties however are nested Meaning for example the Address property will have this but the Country property of the Address also has this functionality.p  pThe problem i seem to be getting is that due to the fact the Address getter is triggering the Country Getter, when i call MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod.ReflectedType in my Country property it returns Address as its type, eventhough the type of the property in question in actually Country.p  pHere are some code snippetsp  precodepublic virtual Country Country                      get                              country  Backoffice.Library.Serialization.Reflection.GetPossiblyProxyPropertyMethodBase.GetCurrentMethod.ReflectedType, country                  return country                          set  country  value           codepre  pIm pretty clueless as to why this would return the wrong Type, i really would like this to be as generic as possibly, i could ofc just do a typeofCountry but then id have to set that for all my properties which sucks p

Negative 1470 pIs anyone out there using the simulator to handle 8kHz audio at the AudioUnit levelp  pThe iPhone simulator audio only works for 44100Hz, 22050Hz, and 11025Hz.  It fails strangely otherwise.p  pI am having trouble recording audio in the iPhone simulator.  The code works fine on a hardare device but fails strangely in the simulator.p  pI am working on the AudioUnit level and I set the sampling rate via audio session properties to 8000Hz.  Works fine on hardware, but on the simulator the render callback asks for one appropriately sized chunk of data and then calls back every 11.6ms asking for a single byte.p  pI tried setting the sample rate to 441004 11025Hz and it worked fine.  So I tried setting the audio session sample rate to 11024 and it broke.  Same with 11026.  11025 works.p  pMy supposition is that there is a bug in the simulators audio code.  I think it internally must have a buffer that is a quarter second long and it cant handle situations where the sample rate is not some multiple of that.p  pCan anyone try this in their own code in the simulator  Try sampling rates of 11024, 11025, and 11026, and see if only 11025 worksp  pUPDATE  If I ask for 11024 it gives me 8000, but the render callback keeps delivering ioData asking for only a single frame 1 byte.  Same behavior when I ask for 8000Hz.p  pUPDATE2 The simulator also works fin when I program at the AudioQueue API level.  It handles 8kHz there.  It just seems to screw up at the AudioUnit API level.p

Negative 1470 pIn the app represented by the image below, Im currently using three UIViewControllers One master view controller, one for the main menu, and one for a settings screen which is launched by the main menu. As Im learning more about how UIViewController works and what its designed for, Im questioning the wisdom of my architecture. p  pIt seems to me that the main point of subclassing is to be able to override the methods which get called automatically during the life cycle of the controller viewDidAppear, viewWillAppear, willRotateToInterfaceOrientation, etc. It appears that these methods are only called if the UIViewController or subclass is part of the UIViewController hierarchy. Therefore, theres no point in subclassing UIViewController unless Im going to use one of the standard means of creating a viewcontroller hierarchy i.e. UINavigationController, [UIViewController presentModalViewController] etc.p  pIm wary of using the Cocoastyle means of adding view controllers to the hierarchy because they all seem to be very restrictive. For example, I could display my settings screen using [UIViewController presentModalViewController], but but I dont want it to obscure the entire screen. Theres background animation which I want the user to be able to interact with even while the settings screen is visible.p  pHere are my questionsp  p1 Is it silly to subclass UIViewController unless Im going to be adding it to the viewController hierarchy via one of Apples techniquesp  p2 Am I correct in my assumption that the builtin means of displaying new views are too restrictive for me, and in order to have the flexibility I want, Im going to need to just load views via [view addSubview]p  p3 If its true that subclassing UIViewController makes no sense for my menu and settings views, how should I avoid having all of my code in one monster UIViewController subclass. Should I just subclass NSObject, add the appropriate IBOutlets and IBActions and pass that in as the Files Owner when I load the nib using [NSBundle loadNibNamed]p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDBNFN.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1470 pI have been playing a MUD game now off and on for over a year. I have scoured the internet looking for the best computer language to learn to develop my own. So far, I have come up with nothing but C. Is C the best language to learn for this application, or is there something betterp  pI know SMAUG was written in C, but that was years ago. I am new to programming in general and have some experience with Python. I have been playing Aardwolf, which allows it users after a certain level to create their own areas. The user does this using Lua. This was interesting to me, because Lua is a scripting language. So this begs another question  Do you build the games format in C or something else but create the world with a scriptp  pAlso, this would be a game with only my friends, so a direct connection would be required since I would not be hosting it online. So, once again, I would like to dive into this world and use this as a pet project to also help me learn a programming language... but which one would be the best that would also allow me to scale it uo in the funturep  pP.S.  Any open source code out there that I can look at and studyp

Negative 1470 pI am testing out the idea of threads, but only in very key spots right now.  Threads add a pretty fascinating level of complexity to just about anything, but with .NET, it seems there are many choices for threads within codeSystem.Threadingcode.  Im looking to know which is the best for handing string operations.p  pConsider a strongcomplexstrong string being fed to a custom object.  That object currently splits the string at some point, and feeds part one to a function, then when that function completes, feeds the other half of the string to a second function.  The two functions have no dependencies on each other, so should be good candidates for threading so that both functions can work concurrently on each piece of the string.p  pExample before theadingp  precodePublic Sub ParseStringByVal SomeStr As String     If String.IsNullOrWhitespaceSomeStr Then         Throw New ArgumentNullExceptionSomeStr     End If       Assume that ParsedFirstString is a boolean that is set to      True if the call to ParseFirstString completes successfully.      Ditto for ParsedSecondString.      Dim MyDelimiter As Char  c     Dim SomeStrArr As String  SomeStr.SplitMyDelimiter, 2      Call Me.ParseFirstStringSomeStrArr0      If Me.ParsedFirstString  False Then         Throw New ArgumentExceptionFailed to parse the first part of the string.     End If      Call Me.ParseSecondStringSomeStrArr1      If Me.ParsedSecondString  False Then         Throw New ArgumentExceptionFailed to parse the second part of the string.     End If End Sub codepre  pbrbrbrThis works fine, and testing inside a timing loop on my multicore system, I can execute it 1,000 times in 140ms170ms avg 1,200ms if 10,000 times.  This is an acceptable speed and if I cant get threading to play nice, then Ill move on.  But I tried one threading approach after looking at one a hrefhttpwww.java2s.comCodeVBThreadStartaThread.htm relnofollowthreading examplea and an SO question on invoking a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq884476482691thread with parametersa and wound up with code similar to the followingp  precodePublic Sub ParseStringByVal SomeStr As String     If String.IsNullOrWhitespaceSomeStr Then         Throw New ArgumentNullExceptionSomeStr     End If      Dim MyDelimiter As Char  c     Dim SomeStrArr As String  SomeStr.SplitMyDelimiter, 2      Dim FirstThread As New ThreadSub Me.ParseFirstStringSomeStrArr0     Dim SecondThread As New ThreadSub Me.ParseSecondStringSomeStrArr1      FirstThread.Priority  ThreadPriority.Highest     SecondThread.Priority  ThreadPriority.Highest      Call FirstThread.Start     Call SecondThread.Start      If Me.ParsedFirstString  False Then         Throw New ArgumentExceptionFailed to parse the first part of the string.     End If      If Me.ParsedSecondString  False Then         Throw New ArgumentExceptionFailed to parse the second part of the string.     End IF End Sub codepre  pbrbrbrThe problem with this is parsing of either the first or second parts of the string can complete before embothem are done, which trips up one of the two exceptions.  So I looked around further and found that I could use the codeJoincode method to wait for both threads to complete.  This solves the tripping up of the exceptions, but it drastically increases the execution time.  Executing the above function 1,000 times and timing it now yields an average runtime of up to 3,700ms.  It almost seems like threading is just not suitable for this kind of task.p  pBut it appears that there are other mechanisms for threading, including ThreadPools and BackgroundWorkers.  Probably others I havent looked up yet I just started messing with this a few hours ago.p  pWhat is the communitys opinion on threading for this kind of task  What is wrong with my first attempt at threadingp  pFYI, I am not updating any UI components nor writing results out to any kind of storage medium.p  pbrbrbrbrstrongConclusionstrongp  pIt appears my string parsing functions are a lot better than I thought.  Having tried both the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.tasks.parallel.aspx relnofollowParallel Classa and the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.tasks.task.aspx relnofollowTask Classa, if I test a 10,000 iteration loop, then single threaded, my test data comes out to about 1,220ms1,260ms.  If I implement even the basic codeParallel.Invokecode to split the parsing into two parallel threads, I pad that timing loop up to an additional 300ms likely due to the overhead of the anonymous delegate, but it seems that there is no way around this.  This is on a Core2 Q9550 Yorkfield, not overclocked, 95W processor, for comparison.p  pThe winning choice is to remain singlethreaded for this specific area of code.  Thanks to all who participatedp

Negative 1470 pThis is what I have to do p  pTo build a CADlike application that loads a point cloud i.e. thousands of 3D points representing a 3D object from file, allows the users to manipulate the points i.e. change the shape by moving the points, do a lot of calculations the points on the points e.g. finding the intersection points between lines and surfaces, detect a point is above or under a surface etc., measure the distances between points, or points to surface etc., and then save the modified points to file.p  pIt also provides basic CADlike UI features such as zoom inout, pan the view, rotation the camera etc.p  pSpeed is the major concern.p  pInstead of writing my own functions for matrix operation and defining my own pointlinesurface classes, I would like to use existing librariesAPIs to do the job.p  pI know WPF, XNA and SlimDX provides the API to do 3D geometric calculations and all of them are finally calling DirectX, but Im just newbie to all of them. Im wonderingp  ol lipWhich one or some other suggestion could give better performance in speed.pli lipMy understanding about DirectXs 3D functions is that it mainly deals with gaming graphics  screen outputs, is it also suitable for datalevel calculationsi.e. use the 3D functions to manipulate the point data, calculate the distances etc., but not outputting it on the screen By suitable, I mean if I create thousands of DirectX vertexes and mainpulate them, would it be much slower than using my own data types and structures Pls correct me if my understanding is wrong.pli lipIf I use WPF, do I need to use XNA as well Im kind of mixing up these two things.pli lipThe application is supposed to run in research labs PC which doesnt have powerful gaming display card, so does it mean XNA is not preferredpli lipAn suggestion about the technologies should be used for this applicationpli ol  pThanksp  pupdatep  pTo make it clearer, the app will load 108,000 points in 3D, and every points will form surfaces with other adjacent points, so roughly the the same number of 3D surfaces are involved Im not generating them at the same time. I will do a lot of 3D geometric and matrix calculations with the point and surfaces, such as intersection, interpolation, transformation etc. , so the speed of the calculations is my major concern. Most of the time I will only draw the final result to the screen and the drawing is mainly lines and points, the speed of drawing is not a big concern . so it is not really a graphicintensive app, but a geometriccalculationintensive app. p  pAfter reading the answer and comments, I think of two options p  ol lipstore amp calculate the data with primitive datatypes, and convert data to the WPFXNASlimDX data structures when drawing them on screen, or pli lipuse these APIs data structures to store, calculation and drawing all those points.pli ol  pwhich one is betterp

Negative 1470 pIm dealing with this server that cant seem to call CURL on itself.br To illustrate  p  ol lipI have a localhost server named a hrefhttpexperiments.local relnofollowhttpexperiments.locala. When I go to terminal and do curl a hrefhttpexperiments.local relnofollowhttpexperiments.locala, that works.pli lipNow I upload all the stuff to this server. httpwww.prod.com. When I ssh to that box and do curl a hrefhttpwww.prod.com relnofollowhttpwww.prod.coma that just hang.pli ol  pIs there any setting that says no curl to self If yes how do I turn that off  p  pJust to clarifybr calling curl a hrefhttpwww.prod.com relnofollowhttpwww.prod.coma from my local machine works too. So its really only when I try doing curl from that same box.  p  pThe reason why I need that is because when a user hit the API living in www.prod.com, that API will call a 3rd party vendor that upon failure  success will hit a callback URL that we pass along to them.  p  pNow since, I added this option to my curl call curlsetoptcurl, CURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATION, true the API call just stall. Works fine on my local machine version since my local machine doesnt have that curl hanging issue.p  pThank you,br Teep

Negative 1470 pWe have a large VS 2010 solution that is mostly C code but there are a few native DLLs that various C projects depend upon including our unit testing DLL.  Were in the processing of trying to support both 32bit and 64bit versions of our libraries.  So were now build the native DLLs as 32bit and 64bit.  The problem is that a lot of our C projects have postbuild events that copy the required native DLLs into the projects TargetDir.  Now that we have two different versions of the native DLLs 32 and 64 bit, I need to be able to specify the correct dir to copy the native DLL from.  I originally thought I could simply use Platform in the path like sop  precodecopy SolutionDirNativeDllPlatformConfiguration TargetDir codepre  pBut that doesnt work because Platform is the emprojectsem platform and not the solution level platform.  In this case Platform is Any CPU.  From what I can see looking at the postbuild event macros in C project, there doesnt appear to be a way to access the solution level platform that is being built.  Is there a better way to accomplish my goalp

Negative 1470 pI am trying to avoid a whole bunch of manual inspection to debug my code, even though the error will most likely turn out to be a mistype or something silly like that.  I am making an ajax call to a Struts 2 action using jQuery and the execution is halted.  At the Javascript level, I get the very descriptive 500 error indicating No clue, you are on your own developer.  So what I am doing at the action level in Struts2 is putting a log.info line after every command.  Here is what I have for demonstration purposesp  precode       log.infoTrying to process   entry.trim        int noteIndex  Integer.valueOfentry.trim        log.infoNote index is   noteIndex   in a list of size   iss.getNotes.size        Integer noteId  iss.getNoteByIndexnoteIndex.getIssueNoteId        log.infoNoteid is   noteId        service.deleteNotenoteId        log.infoNote   noteId   has been deleted codepre  pMy tomcat logs give mep  precode20110708 142654,135  INFO [http80803] IssueNoteAction.java54  Entering delete note with 2,3 20110708 142654,135  INFO [http80803] IssueNoteAction.java61  Trying to process 2 20110708 142654,135  INFO [http80803] IssueNoteAction.java63  Note index is 2 in a list of size 5 20110708 142654,135  INFO [http80803] IssueNoteAction.java65  Noteid is 80686 codepre  pThis indicates that the call to my Struts 2 service, deleteNote which actually does a soft delete an update statement through myBatis, is where the problem is. However, the apparent failure is silent.  Usually when I make a mistake with myBatis, myBatis lets me know and the logs are often very useful and I go about my way fixing my mistake.  I have myBatis set at the INFO level.p  pSo what is it that is shutting up Tomcat  Not only for this occasion, but also for future ajax calls where I need to debug, how do I go about getting more information from TomcatLog4J    p

Negative 1470 pIs there CSS which can allow an element to follow flow similar to positioninline, while a child to the element has positionabsolutep  pEDIT the answer is yes, just use inline and position absolute. I had a different issue than the one I posted. My apologies. My issue was that using marginauto made the item centred, but gave all margins 0 rather than the maximum amount ie. the container would spread as far as it could and the border would generally touch the border of the parent element. To solve the issue Ill be using an additional container and textalign.p  pThanks to the people who helped and read this question.p  pIgnore the following historic portion of the post.p  blockquote   pObviously I want the position absolute to be positioned relative to   the bounds of its parents so the parent would emnotem have   positionstatic.p      pStill I am unsure how to do this.

So I end up with a emhalfcookedem content data. One solution would be to override the parent constructor with something similar to codePagenewFromIDcode making sure that we would be able to set all fields when the codePagecode is instantiated of course by still calling the parent constructor within codePageconstructcode.p  pNow the problem lies in the codePagenewFromNamecode method since such an approach will require me to make 2 queries, one is to get the content id of the page using the codeshortnamecode column, and then when the constructor of the page is called within codePagenewFromNamecode, it will then create a new query to get the data associated with the page. Thats not desirable isnt itp  pSo the only solution I see is to make codePageconstructcode private and force end users to use the static methods to instantiate the object.p  pMy question is, this is something Id like to release as an open source project and it allows users to add more types of contents by simply subclassing the codeContentAbstractcode class. Is requiring a private constructor detrimental to the said objective accounting for human error and the laziness to read through documentation Or should such matters  be the least of my concerns Or are the structures of the actual classes themselves lend to this problemp

Negative 1470 pstrongDisclaimerstrong this is a strange issue that only happens in a Kindle Fire so far.p  pTechnologies Involved Android SDK, Eclipse, a hrefhttplibgdx.badlogicgames.comLibGDXa.p  pI have a relatively simple app running with a hrefhttplibgdx.badlogicgames.comLibGDXa. The way a hrefhttplibgdx.badlogicgames.comLibGDXa works is by having an OpenGL thread that will call Create once and then Render as many times as possible so you can do your render.p  pSo when you initialize the Device, your Create method is called and then when the OpenGL surface is initialized all this happens automagically, your Render starts getting called.p  pIf the OpenGL context is lost, destroyed, etc. your Resizewidth,height method is called by LibGDX. p  pSo far. So good. p  pNow I came across a strange issue with a Kindle Fire where things looked a few pixels off or cut. The Kindle Fire has a softbar at the bottom of the screen 20 pixels that you cant hide or skip, which is kind of ok because the device doesnt have physical buttons. Youre expected to touch this soft bar and get a bigger bar to go back, go home, etc. According to Amazon, this bar cannot be removed. is not 100 clear but nobody has found a way that is not breaking the Amazon rules. The only App Ive seen that removes that is the Amazon Video Players emfor videos streamed from Amazons Cloud onlyem. So as you can see, there doesnt seem to be a way to permanently hide that bar. p  pSo if the bar is there, your real screen state is not the hardware resolution 1024x600 landscape but 1024x580. So I added some logging to my methods to see what was going on, and was surprised with this remember the create, render and resize methodsp  precode1223 151704.119 Imyapp19921 SCREEN HEIGHT AT CREATE 600 [snip other unrelated log stuff] 1223 151704.673 Imyapp19921 SCREEN HEIGHT AT RENDER LOOP 600 [snip other unrelated log stuff] 1223 151704.705 Imyapp19921 MyApp  Resize Called. 1223 151704.705 Imyapp19921 SCREEN HEIGHT AT RENDER LOOP 580 codepre  pSo the screen has been resized by the Kindle Fire, at some point. p  pHas anyone come across something like thisp  pThis is a screenshot notice the black bar on top, thats not added by me.

Negative 1470 pIm designing the intranet web application for our company. One of the app. requirements is to provide widget platform. Which means that developers may create mini application, that will work inside the main web application and can use its resources. Widgets could be independent of applications and they can have there own data models and behaviors. My task is to provide widget abstraction and widgets engine within application widgets management and organizing on the application pages. I reviewed several JS MV frameworks and it looks like Ember.js is the thing that I want to use. But I cant understand how to separate in Ember, the abstract functionality between widgets and the application. From one side, the main application is Ember application by itself that manages current widgets appearance, from other, widgets, are applications to.

Currently I link them by calculating the shortest distance of each of the four line segements of a rectangle.

Negative 1470 pLet me tell you about the problem I am having and how I tried to solve it. I have a UIScrollView which loads subviews as one scrolls from left to right. Each subview has 1020 images around 400x200 each. When I scroll from view to view, I experience quite a bit of lag.p  pAfter investigating, I discovered that after unloading all the views and trying it again, the lag was gone. I figured that the synchronous caching of the images was the cause of the lag. So I created a subclass of UIImageView which loaded the images asynchronously. The loading code looks like the following codeself.dispatchQueuecode returns a serial dispatch queue.p  precode voidloadImageNamedNSString name      dispatchasyncself.dispatchQueue,          UIImage image  [UIImage imageNamedname]          dispatchsyncdispatchgetmainqueue,              self.image  image                codepre  pHowever, after changing all of my UIImageViews to this subclass, I still experienced lag Im not sure if it was lessened or not. I boiled down the cause of the problem to codeself.image  imagecode. Why is this causing so much lag but only on the first loadp  pPlease help me. p

Negative 1470 pI am currently making my first steps into the world of WCF for the past week or so.p  pAnd something keeps popping up on my mind regarding when to use a console app or a WCF Service app in Visual Studio 2010p  pIs it all about self hosting or IIS and WAS hosting The way I got it is that if I am self hosting, a console application is the way to go, since that you would implement the codeServiceHostcode and proxy yourself, whereas in case of IIS or WAS hosting we use a WCF service application Where the codeServiceHostcode is dynamically generated p  pIs my understanding regarding this issue correct Or there are more things into it I feel like some link is missing in here...p

Negative 1470 pIn unit testing with help of mockfake objects, I wonder whether its more preferable to initialize the mocks in SetUp or in the test method itself, if my test class contains methods that test the same class and thus, fake object needed should be the same for all test case. Something like thisp  precodeclass FooTests      MockltIBargt mockBar     Foo fooUnderTest      [SetUp]     public void Setup              mockBar  new MockltIBargt         fooUnderTest  new fooUnderTestmockBar.Object           [Test]     public void MyTest              setup mock methods         mockBar.SetUp ...           test         fooUnderTest.TestSomething          assert something here        codepre  pIt seems that this will prevent us from duplicating code to mockBar and fooUnderTest in each test case, but the downside is that I have to declare class variables mockBar and fooUnderTest or is this really a downside, and it will be problematic if I want to have some special setup for example, if in some testcase I want to overriede some of the virtual methods of Foo. Any suggestion what is the best practice p

So now my middleware cant catch the exception. Maybe it is better to call getheader from context processor, but this does not help too.p

Negative 1470 pI am creating a script for listening to browser back button and loading the previous page. I am new to jquery and javascript a php person. Before re inventing this, I have searched the whole web for a library. But as I am using a lot of parameters in my ajax links, I cant use those libraries.

My grid changes without the page needing to reload. When I update or delete a row, however, I need to manually refresh before I see the changes that were made to the database.

All of my ajax works well but I now realize that I want to keep track of where you are on the page and also be able to link people to specific pages on the site. p  pHere is the site I am talking aboutp  pwww.stevenlebel.comp  pAs you can see, the page is made up of a tv that loads new content into the screen. The videos page uses embedded Vimeo code, the music page uses Soundcloud and images use an Imugr gallery. The reason I built it this way was to allow my friend to update his page without my help.p  pSo my question is, how do I add hash links to the URLS  I would also like to be able to link to a certain video, song or image on the page but am not sure whether this is possible using VimeoSoundcloudImgur.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with thisp  pThanks a lot,p  pkatiep  pA bonus questions  Does anyone know how to remove the .html so when I use hash links the page would say xxwhatever instead of xx.htmlwhateverp

Negative 1470 pIm a little confused about implementing a doubly linked list where the data in the list are pointers.  p  pThe private part of my linked list class looks likep  precode private     struct node        node next       node prev       T o          node first  The pointer to the first node NULL if none     node last   The pointer to the last node NULL if none     unsigned int size codepre  pAs you can see, the list is full of pointers to objects rather than just plain old objects, which makes it a little more confusing to me.p  pThe following is the description in the specp  pemNote that while this list is templated across the contained type, T, it inserts and removes only pointers to T, not instances of T.  This ensures that the Dlist implementation knows that it owns inserted objects, it is responsible for copying them if the list is copied, and it must destroy them if the list is destroyed.emp  pHere is my current implementation of insertFrontT op  precodevoid DlistinsertFrontT o    node insert  new node   insertgto  new To    insertgtnext  first   insertgtprev  last   first  insert  codepre  pThis seems wrong though.

Negative 1470 pWhen I try to compress files and directories with codetarcode using absolute paths, the absolute path is preserved in the resulting compressed file. I need to use absolute paths to tell codetarcode where the folder I wish to compress is located, but I only want it to compress that folder  not the whole path.p  pFor example, codetar cvzf test.tar.gz homepathtestcode  where I want to compress the folder codetestcode. However, what I actually end up compressing is codehomepathtestcode. Is there anything that can be done to avoid this I have tried playing with the C operand to no avail.p

Negative 1470 pstrongI would like to know if theres some regular way to handle duplicates in the database without actually removing the duplicated rows. Or a specific name for what Im trying to achieve, so I can check it out.strongp  pWhy would I keep duplicates Because I have to monitor them. I have to know that theyre duplicates and are not e.g. searchable, but at the same time, I have to keep them, because I update the rows from external source and if Id remove them, theyd go back to the database as soon as I update from external source.p  pI have two ideasp  ol lipHave an additional boolean column searchable, but I feel its a partial solution, it can turn out to be insufficient in the futurepli lipHave an additional column duplicateof. It would keep id of the column of which the row is duplicate. It would be a foreign key of the same table which is kind of weird., isnt itpli ol  pI know its not a specific programming question, but I think that someone must have handled a similar situation Facebook  Pages  they keep track of those which are duplicates of others and it would be great to know a verified solution.p  pstrongEDITstrong these are close duplicates, indetified mainly by their location lat, lng, so DISTINCT is probably not a solution herep

Negative 1470 pI have some basic questions on HTTP authentication  BRp  p1 How does client know about Servers authentication type BasicDigestNTLM of HTTP  BR   is this configurable at HTTP Server side p  blockquote   pBMy AnswerB Server will be set with which authentication type it has to perform with  the client.   So our client APIin C HttpWebRequest API will automatically take care of it.    Best use of Wireshrk with applying HTTP filter you will get  source and Destination IP at Internet Protocol layer. And src and dest port at Transmission control protocol and athentication type at http layer.p blockquote  p2 If i place squid linux proxy in between client and Server is there any need from my client  code should know about authentication type of proxy also or authentication type is only related to the end HTTP server BRp  blockquote   pBMy AnswerB If squid proxy is placed in between Client and Server it wont use HTTP authentication. It may use a DB Uses a SQL database b LDAP Uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  c RADIUS Uses a RADIUS server for login validation. and etc..   So we have to mention proxy authentication credentials in HTTP Headers.p blockquote  p3 Using WireShark found that there are three request from Browser to Server to fulfill single request.

Negative 1470 pIn a library Ive created, I have a class, DataPort, that implements functionality similar to the .NET SerialPort class.  It talks to some hardware and will raise an event whenever data comes in over that hardware.  To implement this behavior, DataPort spins up a thread that is expected to have the same lifetime as the DataPort object.  strongThe problemstrong is that when the DataPort goes out of scope, it emnever gets garbage collectedemp  pNow, because DataPort talks to hardware using pInvoke and owns some unmanaged resources, it implements IDisposable.  When you call Dispose on the object, everything happens correctly.  The DataPort gets rid of all of its unmanaged resources and kills the worker thread and goes away.  If you just let DataPort go out of scope, however, the garbage collector will never call the finalizer and the DataPort will stay alive in memory forever.  I know this is happening for two reasonsp  ol liA breakpoint in the finalizer never gets hitli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma227966SOS.dlla tells me that the DataPort is still aliveli ol  pstrongSidebarstrong Before we go any further, Ill say that yes, I know the answer is Call Dispose Dummy but I think that even if you let all references go out of scope, the right thing should happen emeventuallyem and the garbage collector should get rid of the DataPortp  pstrongBack to the Issuestrong Using SOS.dll, I can see that the reason my DataPort isnt being garbage collected is because the thread that it spun up still has a reference to the DataPort object  through the implicit this parameter of the instance method that the thread is running.  The running worker thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4720991garbagecollectionofthreads47222304722230will not be garbage collecteda, so any references that are in the scope of the running worker thread are also not eligible for garbage collection.p  pThe thread itself runs basically the following codep  precodepublic void WorkerThreadMethodobject unused    ManualResetEvent dataReady  pInvokeSubcribeToEventthis.nativeHardwareHandle   for        Wait here until we have data, or we got a signal to terminate the thread because were being disposed     int signalIndex  WaitHandle.WaitAnynew WaitHandle[] this.dataReady, this.closeSignal     ifsignalIndex  1 closeSignal is at index 1            We got the close signal.  Were being disposed       return This will stop the thread          else            Mustve been the dataReady signal from the hardware and not the close signal.       this.ProcessDataFromHardware       dataReady.Reset          codepre  pThe Dispose method contains the following relevant codep  precodepublic void Dispose    closeSignal.Set   workerThread.Join  codepre  pBecause the thread is a gc root and it holds a reference to the DataPort, the DataPort is never eligible for the garbage collection.  Because the finalizer is never called, we never send the close signal to the worker thread.  Because the worker thread never gets the close signal, it keeps going forever and holding that reference.  ACKp  pThe only answer I can think of to this problem is to get rid of the this parameter on the WorkerThread method detailed below in the answers.  Can anybody else think of another option  There must be a better way to create an object with a thread that has the same lifetime of the object  Alternatively, can this be done without a separate thread  I chose this particular design based on a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSnetfxbclthreade36193cda70842b386b7adff82b19e5e relnofollowthis posta over at the msdn forums that describe some of the internal implementation details of the regular .NET serial port classp  pstrongUpdatestrong a bit of extra information from the commentsp  ul liThe thread in question has IsBackground set to trueli liThe unmanaged resources mentioned above dont affect the problem.

Negative 1470 pI have a table in a database that stores invoice data. I am looking to easily view daily statistics on when a certain action occures. When the action gets performed a note gets added to a column called notes in that table in this format ORDER FILLED G J Apr 20 2013. G J is the initials of the person who performed the action that I am looking to track.  There can be other notes before and after that note. Unfortuntately this action is only logged in this one place in the DB and I do not have control over how the data is logged. I am looking to create a daily report of how many times each user performed this action yesterday. The query below works perfectly however it returns the results of each user as a seperate result and Id liek them to be all in one grid. I am not a programmer or SQL expert, I am just tryning to scratch something together that will work. Is there an easy way to modify my query below so that I can have one table with two columns...

Negative 1470 pthe main reason for using atomics over mutexes, is that mutexes are expensive. but with the default memory model for atomics being memoryorderseqcst, isnt this just as expensive p  pquestion can concurrent program using locks be as fast as concurrent lockfree programp  pif so, it may not be worth the effort unless i want to use memoryorderacqrel for atomics. p  hr  pedit  i may be missing something.. but lockbased cant be faster than lockfree.. because each lock will have to be a full memory barrier too. but with lockfree, its possible to use techniques less restrictive then memory barriers. p  pso back to my question... is lockfree any faster than lock based, in new c11 standard with default memorymodel p  pis lockfree  lockbased when measured in performance true lets assume 2 hardware threads. p  hr  pedit2  my question is not about progress guarantees, and maybe im using lockfree out of context. p  pBasically when you have 2 threads with shared memory, and the only guarantee you need is that if one thread is writing then the other thread cant read or write, my assumption is that a simple atomic compareandswap operation would be much faster then locking a mutex. p  pBecause if one thread never even touches the shared memory, you will end up locking and unlocking over and over for no reason. with atomic operations you only use 1 CPU cycle each time.p  pIn regards to the comments, a spinlock vs a mutexlock is very different when there is very little contention. p

Negative 1470 pIve been stuck with this one for a while now. I have created a mini subset of the project where this occurs and reproduced the issue. Basically Im running a test which loads a spring context file with one bean into an ClassPathXmlApplicationContext object.p  pThe weird thing is, on Windows, my test passes fine when run from an IDE EclipseIntellij and also when I run through maven command line. It fails when the test is run from a UNIX machine Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and this is where the code will inevitable end up.p  pIn the exception below it complains about the LookUtils class. I cant see why its trying to create this class but one thing I noticed about it was that it has a private constructor. Also, Im using spring v2.5.6 and have to stick with this for a security reason. Im pretty stuck with this one so any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank you.p  pHere is the exceptionp  precode Test set StartupTest.AppTest  Tests run 1, Failures 0, Errors 1, Skipped 0,

Negative 1470 pI have an application with a view that contains table views of various models in separate windows.  When I add a table subview to the main view, certain connections are made from the view to subview.  the first time I create a table subview, the connections are established and all works as it is intended.  However, if I close the subview pane and open it again, the connections are not reestablished.  The code is executed, but no connections actually appear to occur.  I presume this has to do with the improper deletion of the subview that was previously closed.p  pI implemented closeEvent in the subview class and called deleteLater from within.  Dont know if thats kosher to call deleteLater from within the same object, but it did trigger the objects destructor.  I also called disconnectthis inside closeEvent, but to no avail.p  pThe only other thing is that main view is not assigned as the parent of the sub view.  Fixing that appears to be problematic.  Is it necessaryp  precode    SubView sview  mSubViewFactory.makeSubView id, mDocument     mSubViewWindow.addDockWidget QtTopDockWidgetArea, sview      connect sview, SIGNAL focusId const CSMWorldUniversalIdamp, this,     SLOT addSubView const CSMWorldUniversalIdamp      connect this, SIGNAL signalUpdateEditorSetting const QString amp, const QString amp,          sview, SIGNAL signalUpdateEditorSetting const QStringamp, const QString amp       connect this, SIGNAL signalUpdateEditorSetting const QString amp, const QString amp,          sview, SLOT slotTest const QString amp, const QString amp      CSMSettingsUserSettingsinstance.updateSettingsEditor codepre  pThe code above is the code which creates the connections between the main view and the subview.  the subview is created by a factory, which is implemented across two classes...  p  pThe UserSettings singletons updateSettings method emits a signal for each user preference value that needs to be updated in the main application e.g., undo stack size, window size, etc..  Signals are connected through the main view to the sub view down to the target class instance that makes use of the value.p  pIt would also appear that if I even open an entirely different table subview, it has the same effect  no connections are established.

Negative 1470 pRecently, my brother suggested me to use modsecurity. I did a research what it truly is and what it does, but I feel very uneasy to decide whether should I use it or not. Here is what in my mind that keep me from not using it.p  ul liSlightly affect my website performance. The more rules, the slower it will get.li liIt does not completely filter all the attacks it is understandable, because it is not possible for any software to truly protect everything.li liSometimes, it can block innocent users.li liAdd another software means add another responsibility to maintain it.li ul  pNow the real question isp  ul lipIf modsecurity cannot filter everything, and you still need to make sure your web application is secure, why not properly write a secure web application without running any Web Application Firewallpli lipSince it is our web application, we know better than any 3rdparty software what expected input from users. Having 3rdparty software to detect the attack and then write a input validation in our web application is like a doublecheck while it is good, but the performance cost would be double as well.pli ul

Negative 1470 pI have a really strange problem with WebRequest in a ServiceStack web application hosted by XSP on Mono. It seems that the registration of request modules works in a very strange way I am using WebRequest to create an http request, and it is failing because it was not able to find a creator for that prefix http.p  pThe exception I am seeing is codeNotSupportedExceptioncode, and I was able to track it to the fact that no creator is registered for the http prefix I am hitting a hrefhttpsgithub.commonomonoblobmastermcsclassSystemSystem.NetWebRequest.cshttpsgithub.commonomonoblobmastermcsclassSystemSystem.NetWebRequest.csa, around line 479p  pEDIT more details codeNotSupportedExceptioncode is thrown by codeWebRequest.GetCreatorcode, which uses the URL prefix as a key to choose which creator to return in my case, a codeHttpRequestCreatorcode. The exception is thrown because there is no creator registered for the http prefix actually, there are no creators at all.p  pSo I searched around a little bit, dug into Mono sources, and found that modules are or should be added to the webRequestModules section of system.web in one of the various .config files.p  pI looked at my machine.config file, and there it is codeSystem.Net.HttpRequestCreator, System, Version4.0.0.0codep  pLooking at a hrefhttpsgithub.commonomonoblobmastermcsclassSystemSystem.NetWebRequest.csWebRequest Mono sourcesa  it seems that prefixes are added from configurations indeed, inside the class static constructor not a good choice, IMHO, but still.. should work.p  pTo test it, I tried to add an codeHttpRequestCreatorcode to codesystem.netwebRequestModulescode in my codeweb.configcode this is loaded by XSPMono and results in a duplicate key exception which is expected, since HttpRequestCreator should really be already loaded, as it is already present in machine.config.p  pEven stranger if I add a mock handler for Http, like thisp  precodebool res  System.Net.WebRequest.RegisterPrefix http, new MyHttpRequestCreator  Debug.Assert res  false codepre  pthe assertion sometime pass... sometime not RegisterPrefix returns false if a creator for the same prefix is already registered I expect it to always return false, but this is not the case Again, it is completely randomp  pWhen the registration fails i.e. returns false because a http prefix is already registered then the WebRequest is able to create requests for http. It is as if calling RegisterPrefix wakes up the static constructor and let it run.p  pI am perplexed it seems like a race condition in the execution of the static constructor of WebRequest, but this does not make sense static constructors are protected by the runtime with a lock, IIRCp  pWhat am I missing How could I solve, or work around this problem Is it my fault misunderstanding or missing something or does it look like a Mono bug, and therefore should I submit itp  pDetailsp  pmono version Mono JIT compiler version 3.0.6 Debian 3.0.6dfsg1exp1pre1p  pPossibly related, unanswered question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq17427255863564HTTP protocol not supported in WebRequest under monoap

Is it possible in another wayp  pEdit My aim was to add a method to set the images name...p

Negative 1470 pWe are developing a numerical simulation program in FORTRAN90 procedural, not OO and unfortunately some COMMON blocks are present but no GOTOs   and are thinking of using Python to help us in unittesting retroactively and verification testing. We would like to set up a testing environment in Python to a do unittesting and b do verification testing i.e. run small test cases with wellknown solutions. We would like to be able to group different tests together by FORTRAN90 procedure for unittesting or by problem topic for verification testing and allow tests to be run either individually or by group. p  pThe simulation program is textinputoutput based, so we could come up with some input files to be run and compared to verified output files. For unit testing, however, I guess we will probably need to write wrappers for each FORTRAN90 subroutine. p  pHas anybody been in a likewise situation before What tips can you give usp  pthanks. p  pbtw rewriting the FORTRAN90 code in Python is not yet an optionp

Negative 1470 pThere seems to be a large amount of information about Cyclic or Rotating Workforce Scheduling problems. I am searching for an algorithm that will help generate a schedule of employee shifts that does not care what the previous weeks schedule looked like.

With that information, I want to create an optimized schedule that caters to the employees desired availability while also meeting the number of required shifts for each day.p  pDoes anyone have tips on a good algorithm for this purpose Thanksp

Negative 1470 pI have several C.Net Webforms apps that can occasionally develop a rather large viewstate. In the past, with iOS 6, I had trouble with Safari truncating the viewstate on postback, causing the application to throw an exception. All other browsers were unaffected of course. I could reproduce the problem, but not always reliably. I found conflicting opinions out there on whether Safari under iOS 6 was chopping off post parameters after the 32k mark or the 64k mark. Breaking the viewstate into chunks did help either. The size of the post as a whole is what mattered.p  pThe official spec appears to be a mystery. Perhaps things change changed with iOS 7 though. strongDoes anyone know if this limitation is still in place and what it isstrongp  pI am considering the rewrite of many pages in an application I inherited and am trying to figure out how small I need to keep my viewstate to make iPad and iPhone users happy. Of course they could be rewritten in MVC but that would take considerably more effort.p

Negative 1470 pIm a little confused about input processing in regards to a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationgeneralconceptualCocoaEncyclopediaModelViewControllerModelViewController.html relnofollowApples MVC patterna. According to Apple, your objects should be divided into model objects which handle the data, view objects which display stuff, and controllers which bind the two and also process events and input. However, many of Apples native UIKit views  UIScrollView, UIControl objects, etc.  do all the input processing themselves, possibly letting their controllers know about it via delegates and data sources. This really confuses me. In my mind, the sturdiness of the MVC triad depends on both the model and view being fairly dumb and thus easily swappable. When all the OSlevel event complexity is centralized in the controller, you have a very nice separation of concerns. On the other hand, adding input processing to the view seems to turn it into a sort of controller of its own.p  pAm I missing something here Whats the correct way to think about thisp

Negative 1470 pMy understanding is that NTLM is a challenge response protocol, whereas Kerberos passes a ticket around. Most information I come across just says this is the reason Kerberos can double hop but NTLM cant, without explaining why NTLM cant just forward responses and challenges. p  pI.e., why isnt this scenario possiblep  pA client authenticates with a front end server, the frontend server then needs to authenticate with a backend server on the clients behalf. The front end then attempts to authenticate and sends the users name, the backend then issues a challenge to the front end, the front end forwards this challenge to the client, the client issues a response that the frontend then forwards this response to the backend.p  pI know that it doesnt work like this, but I am curious about specifics.

Negative 1470 pAccording to the boost documentation, the boost special functions bessel function specifically the modified bessel function should be able to accept a complex input. p  pHowever, when I attempt to feed it one, I get a compile error complaining that there is no codeltcode operator for operand types codefloatcode and codestdcomplexltfloatgtcode.p  pHere is my codep  precodeusing namespace boostmath     stdcomplexltfloatgt cpxTerm  stdcomplexltfloatgtmu1  cosaz, wbar  cossinlim stdcomplexltfloatgt besselTerm  cylbesseli0, cpxTerm codepre  pAs you can see, Im attempting to use boosts modified bessel function implementation for a 0th order, firstkind modified bessel function.p  pThis returns pages of errors, but as far as I can see, all of them are complaining about the lack of a codeltcode operator for the input operands.p  pI have tried explicitly specifying the template arguments as codeltint, complexgtcode, codeltdouble, complexgtcode, and codeltcomplex, complexgtcode to no avail. p  pHere is one examplep  precodeboost.1.50.0includeboostmathspecialfunctionsdetailbesselik.hpp108 error no operator lt matches these operands      operand types are float lt stdcomplexltfloatgt   d  abssigma lt toolsepsilonltTgt                          detected during codepre  pIm using the Intel 2013 compiler with C11 enabled. p  pWhat am I doing wrong herep  pAs a side question, looking at the boost documentation for the function, I noticed this troubling bitp  blockquote   pThe functions return the result of domainerror whenever the result is   undefined or complex.p blockquote  pDoes this mean the function will also fail for complex results when given a complex input where one would conceivably expect the possibility of a complex outputp  pEdit Digging deeper, it appears the problem is that the stdcomplex type has no  or lt operators. This somewhat makes sense, in that its somewhat ambiguous to question whether one complex number is greater than the other does one go by the magnitude, the real component, the imaginary etc...p  pThus it seems that, although the bessel function is defined for complex inputs, boost itself doesnt support complex inputs for the bessel function. It seems the documentation was a bit misleading on this.p

Negative 1470 pThis is not a duplicate We have a 2D maze surrounded by X on all 4 sides and there are inner blocks too. br All these characters of the maze is stored in 2D array. The program must find the path from start S to goal G. For this, a boolean method called solveint row, int col is uses and is initialized with row and column index of S.

Negative 1470 pI am preparing to build a clone of the ambilight for my pc. For this purpose I need a way to calculate the average color of several areas of the screen. p  pThe fastest way I have found so far is the followingp  precode  pd3dDevicegtCreateOffscreenPlainSurfaceddm.Width, ddm.Height, D3DFMTA8R8G8B8, D3DPOOLSCRATCHD3DPOOLSYSTEMMEM, amppSurface, nullptr   pd3dDevicegtGetFrontBufferData0, pSurface   D3DLOCKEDRECT lockedRect   pSurfacegtLockRectamplockedRect, nullptr, D3DLOCKNODIRTYUPDATED3DLOCKNOSYSLOCKD3DLOCKREADONLY   memcpypBits, unsigned char lockedRect.pBits, dataLength   pSurfacegtUnlockRect   calculate average over of pBits codepre  pHowever it involes copying the whole front buffer back to the system memory which takes 33 ms on average. Obviuosly 33ms is no way near the speed that I need for a decent update rate therefore I am looking for a way to calculate the average over a region of the front buffer directly on the gpu without copying the front buffer back to the system memory.p  pedit the bottleneck in the code snippet is codepd3dDevicegtGetFrontBufferData0, pSurfacecode. The memcpy has no visible effect on performance.p  pstrongeditstrongp  pBased on user3125280s answer i cooked up a pice of code that should take the top left corner of the screen and average it.

Negative 1470 pI have Delphi XE4 installed on a machine running Windows 7, 64 bit. I was trying to traverse the following two registry keysp  ol liHKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall li liHKLMSOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstallli ol  pI wrote a simple program that traverses all the subkeys within each of the above registry keys. When I set the target system to be 32Bit, XE4 ignores registry key 1 and gives me the information from registry key 2 instead. When I set the target system to be 64Bit, XE4 recognizes both registry keys as separate and distinct and returns two different sets of data.  p  pWhy does XE4 ignore registry key 1 and substitute key 2 instead when the target system is set to 32Bit Is there a way to read key 1 when targeting a 32Bit systemp  pThis makes me think there are other registry keys that XE432Bit performs some hidden substitute on. p

Negative 1470 pI am trying to find an applications scalibility point using JMeter. I define the scalability point as The minimum number of concurrent users from which any increase no longer increases the Throughput per second.p  pI am using the following technique. Schedule my load test to run for an hour, starting a new thread sending SOAPXMLRPC Requests every 30 seconds. I do this by setting my number of threads to 120 and my ramp up period to 3600 seconds.p  pThen looking at my TOTAL rows Throughput in my Summary Report Listener. A new row thread is added every 30 seconds, the total throughput number rises until it plateaus at about 123 requests per second after 80 of the threads are active in my case. It then slowly drops the throughput number to 120 per second as the last 20 threads are added. I then conclude that my applications scalability point is 123 requests per second with 80 active users.p  pMy question, is this a valid way to find an application scalibility point or is there different technique that I should be tryingp

This slows the query down massively when I use the OR in the ON clause to get that data included.

Negative 1470 pI have a method that returns a DefaultTableModel populated by a database. What I wanted to do is add boolean check boxes to each records returned by adding a new boolean column to the returned DefaultTableModel instance. The user should be able to only clickunclick these checkboxes Multiple selection should be allowed to manipulate some map objects I have in the GUI. Other columns should be uneditable.

Negative 1470 pSorry if this is a little rambling and takes in a few subjects. I will try to keep it straightforward and say off the bat that I am new to JS, jQuery and PHP p  pI have some JS that generates a string and I want to save this string in a plain text .txt file to the users local machine.p  pI have a PHP file set up that simply does thisp  precodeheaderContenttype textplain headerContentDisposition attachment filenametestFile.txt echo Saved Data codepre  pIf I navigate straight to this page then I get testFile.txt appear in my Downloads folder. All good so far so I tried to send my string from the JS usingp  precode.postphpwriteFile.php,      dataTest Data , functiondata, status      alertData   data  nStatus   status  codepre  pNow when I run this the alert fires and reads the Saved Data string so I assume the PHP is getting reached but the download does not trigger.p  pIf anyone can explain whats going on here for my own education that would be great. If you can suggest how to get it working then that would be even better for my sanity p  pCheers all.p

Negative 1470 pGood day all,p  pI am work on C .net 4.0 framework, and database is microsoft SQL server 2008 R2.p  pThere is a system to let user do gift redemption. When User click on the redeem button, system will p  ol licheck on the gift inventory first before update customergift table, li liand update the giftinventory table for the particular gift. li ol  pIf the inventory is less than 0, then it will prompt error message to tell user that the gift is already finish, and then cancel the redemption process.p  pThere is a problem happen in the following condition p  pGift A only have 1 quantity in inventory now.p  pCustomer Jack click on redeem button at code20131111 092227.780code. Customer Jess click on redeem button at code20131111 092227.497code.p  pThe different time they click on redeem button is only 0.0283 seconds.p  pThus, maybe the different time is too short, both of them was successful redeem the gift because, before the system first customer update the giftinventory table, the system second customer already get the data from inventory Gift A, thus, system still let second customer to proceed because the inventory is still equal to 1.p  pI have think out of a way to solve this problem, which is describe as follow  Create a new column for the giftinventory table, name codelockcode, with data type codeBooleancode . When customer clicked on the redeem button, and before the system check the gift inventory, set the Boolean to codetruecode. Thus, if the second customer, try to access to the gift inventory, and found that the codelockcode  codetruecode, then system will wait for 1 seconds and then try to access again, until the codelockcode  codefalsecode, then only access and get the inventory data. p  pHowever, I dun think this is a good solution. I think this may cause the database become slow.p  pAny idea and suggestionp

This works better than the custom format labeller as there is no delay between the horizontal labels and real time.  However, after about 600 data points,p  precoderounded  codepre  pbecomes greater than the length ofp  precodevalues codepre  pand I get the out of bounds error.

So, I should read the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64700128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowVSVERSIONINFOa structure, change the build number and then update it back to the PE.p  pIm working with this code as base a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma79998131970843httpstackoverflow.coma79998131970843a.

Negative 1470 pIn the options page of my extension, I display the username of the person logged in, along with an option to log out. If they log out, I display instead a link asking them to log in. As well as being able to log in via the options page, they can also do so via the popup.html. The loggedin status is stored in localStorage, which I can access from the options page js. p  pI would like to be able to listen, in some way, for a change to this status, and update the UI accordingly. If changes are made via the options page, then I of course can change it. However, the issue is if a user logs in whilst via the popup, whilst already on the options page. In that situation, I would still like the options page UI to alter, to now reflect the updated loggedin status. I have thought of 2 different approachesp  p1 Have the background script send a message using chrome.runtime.sendMessage to the options script every time I change the logged in status.p  p2 Add a listener on the localStorage that fires when the loggedin status is changed.p  pI have tried both approaches, and failed. How can I automatically refresh the UI of my options page depending on the value of a localStorage variable which can be altered from different scripts within the extensionp  pThe answer may be in 1 or 2, however my experience with chrome extensions is limited, so I might have got it programatically wrong and given up too early. Any help would be appreciated.p
Negative 1470 pIs there any way to run a test on output created from a call to errorlogMessage when doing unit tests with phpunitp  pExample code, one of my functions tests a credit card with a luhn algorithmp  precodeifcheckLuhn ampamp thisgtluhncheckcardNumber  false      errorlogMETHOD .  cardNumber failed luhn algorithm check.     return false  codepre  pcheckLuhn is a boolean passed in to tell it whether to do the check, the luhncheck returns true if the cardNumber passes.

Negative 1470 pIve looked through topics on how to open only one window when a button is clicked but none of the solutions there helped, perhaps because my code was structured a bit differently. p  pSo I have a main window class extending JFrame and one of the buttons is supposed to open a new window when clicked. I have defined the widgetspanels etc for the new window in a separate class. At the moment, every time I click on the button a new window is opened. I want to make it so that if a window is already opened then it would switch to that window once the button is clicked again.p  pHere is a bit of my codep  precodepublic class MainWindow extends JFrame             create widgets and panels           Button.addActionListenernew ActionListener   the button that opens                                                      a new window                  Override                 public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                      Window2 ww  new Window2 creating the new window here                                     codepre  pstrongNB.

Negative 1470 pIm making a bookwebsite with a jQueryplugin. Every time a link is clicked, the bookpage switches to the next page and the .active class switches from link. The problem is that if you click fast between the pages, the active class switches but the movement of the book is too slow so you dont hop to the next page.p  pIm trying disable the link after u clicked on one. My idea was just removing an attribute for a couple of seconds like thisp  precode.button.clickfunctione      .. switch page using id     .. switch .active      .button li a.removeAttrid  codepre  pSo when the page is loaded, and the active class is switched. U cannot click on another link until the attribute is put back on.p  pHow can remove an attribute for a couple of seconds Or are there other options to disable a link for a period of time without removing the attributep

Negative 1470 pQuick question. What is the best thing to do, I have a friend that asked me to make a website for his business. There are 3 people that work on one Excel sheet, sometimes possibly even at the same time. They currently store that file in dropbox and when they need to work on it they download the file and then upload again. p  pIs there a way maybe with MySQL or something that I could Import that Excel sheet on the website so that they could work on it at the same time So they wouldnt have to download it everytime they want to change something. p  pPlease help me with this one. p  pGreatly appreciate your help.

Negative 1470 pIm using a binary classification with SVM and MLP for financial data. My input data has 21 features so I used dimensionally reduction methods for reducing the dimension of data. Some dimensionally reduction methods like stepwise regression report best features so I will used these features for my classification mode and another methods like PCA transform data to a new space and I use for instance 60 of best reported columns features. The critical problem is in the phase of using final model. For example I used the financial data of past year and two years ago for today financial position. So now I want use past and today data to prediction next year. My question is here Should I use PCA for new input data before inserting to my designed classification model How can I use For example Principal component analysis for this data I must use it like before pcanewdata or there is some results from last PCA that I must use in this phasep  pmore information p  pThis is my system structure I have a hybrid classification method with optimization algorithm for select best features inputs of my model and best parameters of my classification method so for a classification method like MLP I takes long time to optimization with 21 features beside of this I repeat every iteration of my optimization algorithm 12 times  cross section  . So I want decrease the features with dimensionally reduction techniques like PCA, NLPCA or supervised methods like LDAFDA before insert it to classification method. For example Im using this structure of PCA code p  p[coeff,score,latent,tsquared,explained,mu]  pcaememp  pAfter that I will use 10 first columns of output that sorted by PCA function for input of my classification and optimization model. In final phase I will find the best model parameters with the best combination of inputs. For example my raw data has 21 features.

Negative 1470 pI am new to Delphi and Firemonkey and I have it to where I can deselect a TTreeViewItem by clicking on it again if it is already selected. The only problem Im seeing with it, is that I only know how to create events for items that are already created in the developer window and arent created later by the user.p  pI know it can be cleaned up a bit but heres where I create the TTreeViewItems. I have Button1 when clicked create a node item with the text from ClearingEdit2 in TreeView1 and if no nodeschildren are selected it creates a new root node, otherwise it creates it as a child of the parent selected nodep  precode    procedure TForm3.Button1ClickSender TObject     var       Item1  TTreeViewItem     begin       if NodeSelected  DeSelected then         begin           Item1  TTreeViewItem.CreateSelf           Item1.Text  ClearingEdit2.Text           Item1.Parent  TreeView1         end       else         if NodeSelected  Selected then           begin             Item1  TTreeViewItem.CreateSelf             Item1.Text  ClearingEdit2.Text             Item1.Parent  TreeView1.Selected             TreeView1.Selected.Deselect             TreeView1.Selected.Expand             NodeSelected  DeSelected             ClearingEdit2.SetFocus             ClearingEdit2.SelectAll          end       end codepre  pLater on in the program Im using this for the eventp  precode    procedure TForm3.TreeViewItem1ClickSender TObject       begin         if NodeSelected  Selected false then           begin             NodeSelected  Selected             Label1.Text  Selected           end         else         if NodeSelected  Selected then           begin             TreeView1.Selected.Deselect             NodeSelected  DeSelected             ClearingEdit2.SetFocus           end         else       end codepre  pSo far, because of the way its structured, I can get it to deselect the already made item, but not TreeViewItems in general which is what I need. I just dont know how I should be phrasing it to work dynamically regardless of the name, but just using all TreeViewItems from TreeView1.p

Negative 1470 pI want to be able to mark properties in my viewmodel to be formatted using a custom format when displayed in my MVC view.p  pI assume I need my own displayformatattribute and set the displayformat but I am not sure how to set this displayformat or where. If I want to show a number as currency it is easy, just set DataFormatString to 0C in the constructor of the attribute.p  pBut if for example I want to mask email addresses so remove the domain name, how would I do this using either a displayformatattribute or maybe a datatypeattribute So it is a string field that I want to transform. I know there are other approaches e.g. custom display templates but then I would lose some of the inbuilt htmlhelper functionality. I just want to change the format of the string nothing else. And preferably make it as simple as adding an attribute to those fields that need maskingp  pThe DataFormatString doesnt seem to be able to take a custom formatterp  pcheers Philp

Negative 1470 pIve decided to integrate Qt into my OpenGL project. Up until now, Ive used raw OpenGL calls to make textures, make framebuffers, draw things etc. The problem is that the OpenGL calls are hidden inside objects such as the texture object. For example, you would give the texture object a string path in its constructor, and then the object would automatically load that texture data from the file and create an OpenGL texture with it Obviously using OpenGL functions to do so . Thanks to QOpenGLFunctions being an object itself, I either have to restrict where these calls are made, or pass a reference to it to EVERY object in my project that makes an OpenGL function call.p  pThis really isnt desirable.

By the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died while in the military service. It typically marks the start of the summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.p  h2History of the holidayh2  pThe practice of decorating soldiers graves with flowers is an ancient custom.[5] Soldiers graves were decorated in the U.S. before[6] and during the American Civil War. A claim was made in 1906 that the first Civil War soldiers grave ever decorated was in Warrenton, Virginia, on June 3, 1861, implying the first Memorial Day occurred there.[7] Though not for Union soldiers, there is authentic documentation that women in Savannah, Georgia, decorated Confederate soldiers graves in 1862.[8] In 1863, the cemetery dedication at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers. Local historians in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, claim that ladies there decorated soldiers graves on July 4, 1864.[9] As a result, Boalsburg promotes itself as the birthplace of Memorial Day.p  hr  pShould the strongIntroduction Textstrong and the strongHistory of the holidaystrong section each be in its own row and column or should I be using the semantic tags See below examplep  precodeltdiv classrowgt   ltdiv classlarge8 push4 columnsgt          ltdiv classrowgt        ltdiv classlarge12 columnsgtIntroduction text and next paragraphltdivgt      ltdivgt       ltdiv classrowgt        ltdiv classlarge12 columnsgtHistory of the holiday and next paragraphltdivgt      ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt  codepre  hr  precodeltdiv classrowgt   ltdiv classlarge8 push4 columnsgt          ltsectiongt        ltdivgtIntroduction text and next paragraphltdivgt      ltsectiongt       ltsectiongt        ltdivgtHistory of the holiday and next paragraphltdivgt      ltsectiongt   ltdivgt ltdivgt  codepre

Negative 1470 pI have two domains that are closely related to each other. Because of this Im putting a fixed box on the top right corner of the page so that users can quickly jump between the two sites. However I would like to add a page transition to this action so that when the user clicks the link in the box the site will gracefully transition to the new URL. p  pI know you can do this with internal pages via JQuery Mobile  a hrefhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.1.0docspagespagetransitions.html relnofollowhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.1.0docspagespagetransitions.htmla , however the limitation is that the link has to be ajax, and can not be activated to new URLs. p  pDoes anyone know how to accomplish this Ideally I would like to use the Flow or Slide transition. However Ill take any example or reference you can provide and adapt it to my needs. p  pThe solution does not necessarily need to be jQuery, it can be javascript, HTML 5, CSS or any other solution that may work.p  pThanks, Andrewp

Negative 1470 pI am preparing to build an AndroidiOS app that will require me to make complex polygon and containment geospatial queries. I like Apache Cassandras no single point of failure, fault tolerance and data center awareness. Cassandra does not have direct support for geospatial queries that I am aware of but MongoDB and Couchbase Server do. MongoDB has scaling issues and Im not sure if Couchbase would be a better alternative than Cassandra with Solr or Elasticsearch. p  pWould I be making a mistake by going with Datastax Enterprise DSE, Cassandra and Elasticsearch over Couchbase Server Will there be a noticeable difference in load times for web pages with the CassandraES back end vs. Couchbasep
Negative 1470 pMy interest is this Id like to set up a single homework repository to share with my students. The repository contains templates, specifications, and unit tests. Students derive from this repository, complete their homework, and push their changes for grading.p  pThis past year I did this using Bitbucket. I created a public Git repository containing my files. They created private forks. Mostly this worked well.p  pMy problem is this whenever I make changes to my files i.e., fix a bug in the unit tests, the students must actively sync with my original repo. Many students do not do this and do not see the updated files. I know at the shell they can executep  precodegit remote add skeleton gitbitbucket.orgprofprofrepo.git git pull skeleton master codepre  pbut Id like to use this in Eclipse and in my very early CS classes, where technological intimidation is an issue and utility scripts are not feasible. Even if we get the tools set up correctly, students still forget to grab the changes from my repository.p  pIs there a way I can integrate pulling from my original repo into the threestep pullcodepush workflow Does Git support thisp

Negative 1470 pOkay, so I have a fairly thorough understanding of programming Bachelors in CS, but Web Development is an absolute nightmare, and no one Ive asked can give me any emrealem information on what I should be doing here. Most of them go, oh, look at that. nifty. and thats the end of it.p  pIve been doing a lot of pet projects with dynamic content, and to speed the process up, I wrote a function to create and insert elements into the DOM. Its fairly straightforward, and not exactly elegant, but gets the job done. p  pAs the title says, Im looking for ways to improve this, perhaps a better established practice, and then I have a question about implementing it.p  pHeres the codep  precodeapp.newDOMObject  function type, attributes, values, parentNode, innerHTML      if type          var element  document.createElementtype         if attributes ampamp values              if attributes.length  values.length ampamp attributes.length gt 0                  for var i  0 i lt attributes.length i                      element.setAttributeattributes[i], values[i]                                                if innerHTML              element.innerHTML  innerHTML                  if parentNode              parentNode.appendChildelement                      return element       codepre  pand then when I want to use it, I do either p  precodevar thing  app.newDOMObjectdiv, [id], [thing], document.body, thing1 codepre  por justp  precodeapp.newDOMObjectdiv, [id], [thing], document.body, thing2 codepre  pdepending on if I need to reference it later or not. p  pMy last question is What happens to the returned element with thing2, since Im not assigning it to a variable I should obviously know this, but is it cluttering up global Does it know Im not using it, and just drop it Theres no prototyping or anything, and its just returning an element thats already in the DOM. Where does it go and why does this work without an error p  pIm sure I should read a book on advanced JavaScript mechanics, but I dont actually know what Im asking, and five minutes Googling keywords like expression and declaration and returning to not a variable were about as helpful as you can imagine.p  pAnd most posts I did find on the issue all recommended templating libraries, but Id like to avoid them if I can.p  pAny thoughts would be much appreciatedp  pThanks for the help Tylerp

Negative 1470 pIm currently evaluating these two different ways of developing mobile apps. Since Im still a student I dont have as much free time and my main priorities is what will benefit me the most in regards to employability, and the potential application of the skills gained in other areas.p  pIt seems to me that Cordova is better than famo.us in those two aspects, since it uses just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I can use in many other areas, and is also the easiest to get started with. On the other hand famo.us, despite being allegedly blazingly fast, due to its nonstructured HTML, and usage of CSS transforms for positioning of content, has quite a high learning curve, and the skills I pick up when learning the framework wont benefit me anywhere else, since they are both specific to and dependant on famo.us. The massive speed boost Ill be getting probably outweighs those downsides though.p  pCould someone provide any insight based on those requirements Im struggling to make a decision on what I should invest my time in.p

This means, a uniform grid is fine. A uniform grid allows to determine the cell for a point by translating the coordinates.li liThe polygons are convex. This means that the center point is actually near the bulk of its area.li liThe polygons have largely the same size. By choosing a cellsize close to the average polygonsize, it is very likely that either the direct cell or one of the neighboring cells is associated with the wanted polygon.li liBasically always, there is a polygon that contains the point. I.e. little time is wasted on searching all cells.li ol  pSo, while this works for exactly my use case, I would like to loosen some restrictions.

Negative 1470 pLets say I was inserting p new elements at the i th position in an codestdvectorltmytypegtcode of size n.p  pSince items in codestdvectorcode are guaranteed to use contiguous storage locations for their elements, it seems like this would take me 4 steps to do the abovep  p1 Possible reallocation of the vector if we are out of space, basically doubling its size. But that is a constant time operation albeit a very large one.p  p2 Next there is a memcpy of elements from index 0 through i1 from the old vector into the new one.p  p3 Then you copy p new items being inserted at ith index.p  p4 Then another memcpy for all items from i1 through n indexes from the old vector to the new vector.p  pArent all the above constant time operations Then shouldnt insertion itself be a constant time operation Why then is codestdvectorinsertcode linear on the number of elements inserted copymove construction plus the number of elements after position movingp

Negative 1470 pI am new to Spring and am having trouble getting fresh data for a user. I have a class called CustomUserDetailsService which implements UserDetailsServiceand Serializable. In it I have a function called loadUserByUsernameString which returns a class called MyUser which implements User. Everything works mostly as expected A user can view a list of data objects from the UI, post via a form, and add entries to the list and the changes will get propagated. The problem arises when someone else that is not the current user, makes a change to the data adds an entry, the current user will not see that change to the list until his session either times out or he clears his cache and fetches new data. What are some possible things I could be doing wrong here I can destroy the jsession cookie with javascript every page load, but then I would loose Springs advanced session caching system. Thanksp

Negative 1470 pCurrently all our project builds with Maven on Windows. We were not successful with making incrementally compiled code to work in run time 50 of the cases it was failing with some kind of error, so to benefit from warm compiler and maybe properly working incremental compilation we think about moving to SBT. However currently I have only one sprint to work on it, and Im afraid to put all the eggs in a single basket and try to migrate whole project in a sprint. I need to find a way to make this change gradual, so I could advance one module at a time. So here are the main questionsp  ul liHow can I include SBT modules in Maven build or maybe vise versa, having my parent in SBT, yet part of the modules still building with Mavenli liHow can we still benefit from IDE support currently IntelliJ 13, like updated indices on changes in pom  Build.scala, task amp goals invocation and so onli ul  pAny advises on subject are highly appreciated.p

Negative 1470 pMy root view controller is a UITabBarController.  Im trying to present a modal view controller over one of the tab bar controllers view controllers, but still allow the tab bar to be used to go to a different tab  in other words, I would like for the modal to only interrupt to the flow of that particular tab, not the entire app.p  pTo do this, Ive set the presenting view controllers presentation style as Over Current Context in storyboard. The problem Im having is that after presenting the modal view controller and selecting a new tab, the presenting view controllers view is removed from the window, and isnt added back to the window when dismissing the presented view controller.  After dismissing the view controller, moving to another tab and then coming back finally puts the presenting view controller back into the window.p  pIve reproduced my problem using the Tabbed template in Xcode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL75B3.png altp  pAfter presenting modal  Ive added transparency to the presented view controller to easily see whats going on in the presented view controller.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCyxOK.png altp  pChanging to second tab and then back  the presenting view controllers view has now been removed. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXZ5FS.png altp  pDismissing the modal leaves the presenting view controller with its view still removed from the window.  Going to tab 2 and returning adds the view back to the window. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb3fSS.png altp  pIm hoping this is something simple Ive overlooked in storyboard, but the fact that I can present the modal and see the presented view controller behind it before changing tabs makes me think I have things set up correctly.p

Therefore, you can only draw UIImages over UIImageViews.p  pSo another problem arises here as well, because when it comes to placing the UIImage where the user touches, UIImages do not have the center property and i cant seem to position the UIImage according to touch.p  pIts easy to place the UIImage when its assigned to an imageView. Because you can set the touch location to UIImageViews center property.p  pHowever, when using UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions and trying to drawInRect that UIImageView into the other UIImageView, theres a compiler error notifying me that drawInRect does not have an interface to declare drawInRect.p  pMy question is to you guys, How can I create a custom drawInRect Method where I can draw UIImageViews into another UIImageView. and then be able to save the merged context of both Using UIGraphicsContextWithOptions.p  pORp  pHow can I positionwith touch an UIImage to overlay over an UIImageView and then be able to save the merged context of both Using UIGraphicsContextWithOptions....etcp  pALL suggestions are welcome.p

The problem now is that I need to use the data that the .gsp is accessing basic http get request along with the page load within my JavaScript.p  pI could just make the controller render the data as JSON but then the grails template hooks would stop working.p  pI could fetch all the values from the DOM and build a local model in JS OR I could do some horrible mixup of outputting data using .gsp geach and then saving each one to JS inline but both processes seem ridiculous.p  pI could get the controller to respond with data for the .gsp AND render as JSON separately for the JS but this just seems wrongp  pIm at a loss as to how to do this, please offer any suggestionsp

I also tried replacing codeuniqueptrcodes with codesharedptrcodes, but to no avail, it did not work.p  pCan I still get away with smart pointers following a different approach Or do I have to manually manage the memory I allocated inside the  factory not preferredp

Negative 1470 pIve built an Android application which calls a TCP socket related thread from six different activities. It works just and fine, but as I try to add a simple dialog witch asks the users idpw just before starting the threadthe retrieved data will be required in the thread, Im having trouble.

Negative 1470 pI am securing an ASP.NETMVC web application running on top of MS SQL. As part of that I have different database connections to perform different things in the website. p  pEDIT   Of course it is up to the DBA and Ops people to decide how data is accessed and how the app is hosted, but they cant do much with an application that isnt granular enough to afford them the controls they need to lock things down. p  pThe system uses only stored procedures with no dynamic SQL. Some stored procedures mutate data, so I call those using a conceptually different connection than the one used for other data access that only reads. No SQL user has rights to access any other database object than a stored procedure. Account authorization has a separate connection. Some parts of the web application shows billing information, other parts of the website direct billable work. There seems to be ways of putting bulkheads into place that separate conceptually different things.p  pI am looking for a way to integration test that I am not overly generous with the privileges chosen. I would like a mechanism that throws an exception on the build server if a dev tried to use the wrong access level in the wrong place in the code, even if the mistake is that the chosen account actually has too many privileges, which would give no error from the database.p  pI have been down the route of creating an implementation of IDbCommand that would act as a factory of IDbCommand instances that would basically issue the same command onto the backend using two different connections using different principals that have different access rights in SQL Server and then throw if the lower privileges would have been sufficient. p  pI have two problems with this approachp  ol liIt is hardly elegant or obviously flawless. I have barely finished thinking about it and it is strongsostrong much code already. Id have to queue up all things happening to the lower connection and then replay that on the higher privileged connection which will not be realistic in how it works and may cause weird timing issues with the other code. I like to code, but I also like my tests to be trustworthy and easily understood and without introducing a new set of complexities that make the tests brittle in a different way than the code under test. Maybe if I fully duplicate all the work and all the data and run separate databases, but then the build server scripting will be a nightmare.li liIt hardly qualifies as granular.li ol  pSurely this is a solved problem that only because of bad luck or bad google fu evaded my several hours of searchingp

Negative 1470 pI am using the Fortify SCA plugin with Maven 3.2.1 to scan a pretty large Java webapp.p  ol liI have a custom .bat file that sets up my all my environment variables and makes a call to mvn.bat to start the scan.li liThen mvn.bat reads my pom.xml and finds the custom profiles for clean, translate, and scan and then calls sourceanalyzer.li ol  pThe trouble is, it never seems like sourceanalyzer uses the full amount of memory that I grant it in either the custom bat file or the pom file.

Negative 1470 pI researched through Stackoverflow and some tutorials but cannot find an information on whether it is possible to configure the account under which the Reporting Services are running to have the permissions of an application role which is set on the source database For example, I created a specific application role on the database for the reports and report builder to only being able to query certain schemas. How do I force the Reporting Services to use that role when connecting to that database as its sourcep  pI want to make this work in Reporting Service itself. Because when the client deploys our reports, by default my database is the source for all of those reports. So it makes sense, for security reasons, to make sure that all deployed reports can only access what they should be accessing. And if a client decides to add a new report  they only have access to certain schemas that they can query.p  pI looked under the Security dropdown option from the data source, but see no way of configuring it to work against the application role.p

Negative 1470 pIm trying to create an app where I have a detail view and everything is inside of a navigation controller. On the main screen I have a table view with a bunch of words and when the user taps in one it shows the detail page for that row. p  pThe detail page is where Im having all the problems. This page is composed by a bunch of elements. One Button, One Label, Two Web Views and Ill probably add more stuff in the future. The tricky part is that the second webview is loaded dynamically and the amount of content changes based on the word. p  pIm using the ViewController as a delegate for the webview to adjust the height based on the amount of content and avoid scrollbars inside the webview because I would like to have the entire content of the page scrolling except the navigation bar when the content is too big instead of just tiny box scrolling.

Im trying this for two days now and I googled and watched a bunch of videos but I still cant find the solution without trying to code to update the constraints and height of the content view programmatically but that sounds like a lot of stuff to something that sounds not so advanced.p  pMy question is Is that a way to make a constraint for the ContentView associated with the last element the Dynamic WebView to make its height increase when the height of the WebView changes as wellp  pThank you so much and sorry for such a long explanation.p  pThats the code for the automatic height for the webview I havep  precodefunc webViewDidStartLoadwebView UIWebView gt Void      var frameCGRect  webView.frame     frame.size.height  5.0     webView.frame  frame   func webViewDidFinishLoadwebView UIWebView gt Void       var mWebViewTextSize CGSize  webView.sizeThatFitsCGSizeMake1.0, 1.0     var mWebViewFrame CGRect  webView.frame     mWebViewFrame.size.height  mWebViewTextSize.height     webView.frame  mWebViewFrame  codepre

Negative 1470 pSo, I have developed a web application in VS 2010 using ASP.net with VB.net codebehind. This web app is hosted on the company server.

Exception from HRESULT 0x80070542p blockquote  pNow, this error prevents me from even running the program in debug mode. HOWEVER, its important to know that the published version of the program, which is almsost the same, has no problems and it still working well.

Negative 1470 pI have a small KSH that performs what seems to be, on the surface, a relatively simple function. A date gets passed in in the format YYYYMMDD, and this checks whether it falls within BST. If it is within BST, 5 hours is added to it and assigned to BSTSTARTDATE, and 29 hours is added to assign to BSTENDDATE. If not, 630 hours are added.p  pSo for example, if the date was 20150330, you would get the followingp  precodeBSTSTARTDATE2015033005 BSTENDDATE2015033105 codepre  pThis generally works fine, except when for days where the timezone changes.

Negative 1470 pWere currently looking to implement a sort of persistent cache utilizing MongoDB as the repository. Were working with a legacy code base which contains classes  that utilize HybridDictionary, a .net specialized collection.p  pA sample class structure that were using is as followsp  precodepublic class Section      HybridDictionary SubSections  new HybridDictionarytrue      public Guid SectionID get set     public string Name get set     public HybridDictionary SubSections get  return this.SubSections   codepre  pThe codeSubSectionscode property, in this instance, contains additional codeSectioncode type items. Basically a parent, then its children. Its children can additional children, etc.p  pWhen we use the Mongo Driver to FindAndModify one of these documents, were running a Query which expects a codeMongoCacheItemcode. A codeMongoCacheItemcodecontains an codeObjectcode property which is, in this instance, a type of codeSectioncode.p  precodepublic class MongoCacheItem      [BsonId]     public string Key  get set       public object Value  get set   This is a Section   CacheContext.Cache.FindAndModifynew FindAndModifyArgs      Query  QueryltMongoCacheItemgt.EQx gt x.Key, key,     Update  Update.ReplacecacheItem,     Upsert  true  codepre  pWhen we run the above logic, the first codeSectioncode is serialized correctly. So we get a document in Mongo that contains properties codesectionidcode and codenamecode, but no codeSubSectionscode.p  pAfter digging through the serialization documentation we found that we could decorate the codeSubSectionscode property with code[BsonDictionaryOptionsDictionaryRepresentation.ArrayOfDocuments]code, so now we havep  precodepublic class Section      HybridDictionary SubSections  new HybridDictionarytrue      public Guid SectionID get set     public string Name get set      [BsonDictionaryOptionsDictionaryRepresentation.ArrayOfDocuments]     public HybridDictionary SubSections get  return this.SubSections   codepre  pAgain, running the FindAndModfiy, we now get a a document which contains the fully serialized object WITH the codeSubSectionscode serialized as an array of documents with all the children. This works as expected.p  pHowever, when we retrieve the document from Mongo using FindOne, the Value is being returned with only the base codeSectioncode deserialized. The codeSubSectionscode property is just an empty collection.p  pI was wondering if anyone has encountered this issue before or if you have any suggestions for a possible solution to the deserialization problem. One possible solution that weve been toying with is building a custom serializer and registering it with Mongo for HybridDictionary types. However, since the cache item codevaluecode is just a plain old codeobjectcode, we could run into additional types that are unable to be serializeddeserialized and therefore might need to build a bunch of different serializers. p

Negative 1470 pIm using Symfony2framework with Doctrine DBAL, and Im inserting some data into MySqldatabase. Insert looks something like thissimplifiedp  precodeconngtinsertsometable, array         col1     gt data1,         col2     gt data2,         col3     gt data3  codepre  pWhat I would like to achieve is the functionality like the ordinary sqlhas. The ability to insert if doesnt exist, like codeINSERT IGNOREcode. But is it possible to do such a thing with DBALp  pNote that I dont use objects here.p  pstrongEditstrong Please do note that Im not using objects, but rather the depicted arrayinsertmethod of DBAL.p  pstrongEdit2strong I tried to approach the problem with using the suggested trycatch, which seems to work quite well except for one thing. The db auto increments the primary key even if no new rows were added. Here is the code that I usedp  precode    try         conngtinsertsometable, array             col1     gt data1,             col2     gt data2,             col3     gt data3             catch Exception e            switch getclasse                 case DoctrineDBALDBALException                     No problems here. Just means that the row already existed.                    break                default                    thisgtgetloggergterrorERROR in .METHOD., Row .LINE. DBerror error .egtgetMessage                    break               codepre  pAnd I also had to do a multiple row unique index for the table, because I have to check if all the columns are the same. i.e. if the whole row is the same as the one we are trying to insert.p  pSo.. It works well otherwise, except that the auto increment value keeps rising up every time we tryinsertcatch. I dont think its a real problem, but it just feels stupid to waste numbers.. Dp

Negative 1470 pDoes anyone know  I am finding that Resharper 9.2 is very buggy with testing and burping.  But the funny thing is that I use Resharper the most for a little function of CTRL  T.  It brings up a quick find where you type and it in real time searches methods, classes, test classes, etc for what you are typing.  So if I am working on an enterprise solution with 50 plus projects and each project can have dozens of classes it is easier to use this.p  pI was wondering now that Visual Studio 2015 has in essence done some of what Resharper did with mapping diagraming and removing and adding references if it could do this.  I know you can find by name above the solution explorer or hit CTRL  SHIFT  F to find in the files.  But these are kind of slow so I was wondering if there was a better way to do it.p  pI was using this reference a hrefhttpvisualstudioshortcuts.com2015 relnofollowhttpvisualstudioshortcuts.com2015a and tried some things but did not find what I thought I was looking for by searching for Find, Retrieve, Get in the shortcuts.  It may be named something I am not aware of.p
