Positive 4527 pI have tables codeCasescode and codeDegreescode with relation codeCases.CIDcode  codeCDegrees.CIDcode. codeCIDcode is Primary Key of codeCasescode with AutoIncrement. p  pBoth tables are used in one form and its assumed that user can add new records to both tables same time and than save whole masterchild data in one GUI action.p  pSo in Dataset where I created FK I set Both Relation and Foreign Key Constraint to ensure during update of new record in Cases table, retrieved IDENTITY value will cause child records to update from 1 to retrieved codeCIDcode value.p  pWhen I update codeCasescode adapter, it causes to retrieve an new IDENTITY value and cascade update in codeCDegreescode child record works ok too. But codeCDegreescodes update causes Insert script with [CID]1 original value. I changed Insert parameter codeCIDcode of codeCDegreescode to Proposed version but same happens seen in SQL Profiler.p  pActually my task is mach more complicated, I just simplified task to localize my problem.p  hr  pTo describe more clearly. before update Both [Cases] and [CDegrees] have one new records with [CID]1 after [Cases] update both [Cases] and [CDegrees] have new CID identity value, just [CDegrees].[CID] Current value is 1 and Proposed is retrieved identity. But when I call [CDegrees]s dataset update, it sends Insert Command to SQL with [CID]1 regardless that I specified CID parameter source as proposed value of [CID].p

I want to perform a set intersection on the sets of the keys of each to find which keys are common to both maps.

Is there any way to do this  Im looking for something that would be this simple, like it is in Javap  precodestdsetltFoogt keys  myMap.getKeySet codepre  pMy understanding is that I cant use the codestdsetintersectioncode function directly on iterators into the maps because the maps expose codestdpaircode objects instead of just keys.

I suppose I could write 4 seperate handlers, but that seems like a waste.p  pThe html for a row looks like thisp  precodelttrgt   lttdgt       ltaspDropDownList runatserver IDddlbc1 gt       ltaspLabel runatserver IDlbl1 gt   lttdgt   lttdgt        ltaspLabel runatserver IDbd1 gt   lttdgt lttrgt codepre  pI have the full client controls Ids if I need them. Anyways, is there a way within this single function to handle any row I added client change event handlers to all the necessary drop downs and pointed them to this single function. I verified they are all correctly wired up. I want lbl1 textx to be the ddl selectedValue, and bd1, in the adjacent cell, to have ddl selectedText. Any help from the jQuery gurus would be appreciated. Thanks guysp  pCheers, ck in San Diego p

Negative 4527 pIve been working on injecting input into a WPF application. What makes this project hard is that I need to be able to inject the input into the application even though its running in the background i.e. another application has the input focus. Using the strongSendInputstrong function is therefore out of the question.p  pSo far, Ive got keyboard input working but am having trouble injecting mouse input.p  pI used Spy to observe the window messages that get sent to the WPF window when I physically click the mouse button. I then simply craft these same mouse messages such as strongcodeWMLBUTTONDOWNcodestrong and strongcodeWMLBUTTONUPcodestrong manually and send them explicitly to the WPF window to emulate mouse input.p  pUnfortunately, this doesnt work as expected not even when I, for testing purposes, have set the WPF window as the foreground window. p  pIve added a button to my test WPF window which when clicked displays a message box. Injecting the appropriate mouse messages when Ive manually positioned the cursor over the button doesnt cause the button to be clicked, however i.e. the clicked event isnt fired by the WPF framework.p  pIf I add a handler for mouse clicks on the actual dialog the client area, that handler emdoesem get called if I position the cursor over the dialog itself and inject the same window messages as beforep  precodethis.MouseLeftButtonDown  WndMouseDown  public void WndMouseDownobject sender, EventArgs e     ...  codepre  pStrangely enough, if I change the push mode of the button to Press i.e. its considered clicked on mouse down rather than the default mouse up, the button clicked event is now fired when I inject the same messages as before. Its worth mentioning that the handler from the example above correctly fires for both mouse downs and ups, so itd seem the WPF framework does process both messages successfully.p  pIt seems like there are some other criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for a mouse clicked event to be fired by the WPF framework. Does anybody know how mouse input is handled internally in WPF, or why its not interpreting my mouse up and down messages as a click on the buttonp  pIts worth mentioning that this approach [sending window messages] works fine on ordinary Win32 windows, such as the StartRun dialog. The difference here is that WPF only has one physical Win32 window and the rest is WPF specific, which means all window messages go to that toplevel window rather than the actual button.p  pIve been searching high and low for an answer to this and would appreciate emanyem thoughts or ideas.p

Negative 4527 pWe develop a module web application by using a separate WAP application project for each module. The primaryroot WAP settings web tab is set to Use local IIS Web Server the path is a hrefhttplocalhostMainProject relnofollowhttplocalhostMainProjecta. p  pThen there are 4 modules. Each module is a WAP with a web configuration set to Use local IIS server with a path such as a hrefhttplocalhostMainProjectModule1 relnofollowhttplocalhostMainProjectModule1a. Each module is also set on the build page with an output path of ..MainProjectbin which is the file system path to the bin folder of the root project.p  pIn IIS manager we have an Application configured as a hrefhttplocalhostMainProject relnofollowhttplocalhostMainProjecta and a virtual directory for each module pointing to the physical path of the WAP project.p  pThis all worked fine with Visual Studio 2005. But, I have moved the project to Visual Studio 2008 and we are unable to use design view in the module projects.

What I did was on each of the module projects I created a virtual directory that isnt a subfolder of the root project. This allowed me to go into design mode on the user controls. It also allowed the forms to be opened to design mode. However, the web controls that come from an external command DLL that we have was not found. I am assuming this is due to the bin folder not being where Visual Studio is expecting it.  p  pAnyone know how I can resolve this Id really like to get this working 100.p

Negative 4527 pSo a lot of web apps have the customer choose their own subdomain, ie mycompany.webapp.comp  pPresumably, every subdomain works off the same set of files and the unique subdomain is perhaps stored as a session object. So how does the URL rewriting workp  pIf someone goes to mycompany.webapp.com, you have to rewrite their unique address to a dynamic page to set the session variable, ie webapp.commypage.phpcusomermycompanyp  pBut then when you redirected, youd be at webapp.comtheappdirectory and not mycompany.webapp.comp  pSo how do they do itp  pPS running IIS but the method should be the same for any server. The big thing for us is we cant do webapp.comtheappdirectorymycompanysomefile.html, ie all the files reside in one directory and well have to set a session variable somehow whilst keeping the subdomain masked.p

Negative 4527 pI am developing a Tomcat app actually its a Red5 app, but this is effectively the same.p  pThis contains the usual WebContentWEBINFlib folder, which is where I locate the various jars it uses. p  pRecently, I pulled a package out of my app project, and converted into a separate Jar project which was then released as open source this resides in the same workspace.p  pWhat I want, is that when I build my Tomcat app, that Eclipse automatically pulls the latest version of the Jar I have built into its WebContentWEBINFlib folder.p  pThis is the behaviour you get with .NET when you reference one project from another, and I guess this is why I was expecting to find some way of doing it.p  pAt the moment, I have to manually copypaste the Jar across each time I build it.p  pOf course, ideally when I build my Tomcat app it would automatically detect if the Jar project was uptodate too, and build it if not.p  pAny suggestions most gratefully received.p

Negative 4527 pMembers of my favorite forum, I am stuck with a simple problem chalk it up to the fact that I am fairly new...p  pI am using an action sheet.  I dont know how many buttons to display, so I decided to set the action sheet delegate to display FOUR buttons in total using string variables, knowing that if I only need to display 2, I can set the third variable to NIL and achieve that objective.p  pExamplep  precodeNSString firstVehicle  [[NSString alloc] initWithString[myVehicleList objectAtIndex0]]             NSString secondVehicle  [[NSString alloc] initWithString[myVehicleList objectAtIndex1]]             NSString thirdVehicle  [[NSString alloc] initWithString[myVehicleList objectAtIndex2]]             NSString fourthVehicle  [[NSString alloc] initWithString[myVehicleList objectAtIndex3]]              UIActionSheet actionSheet  [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitlePlease select a vehicle delegateself cancelButtonTitleCancel destructiveButtonTitlenil otherButtonTitlesfirstVehicle, secondVehicle, thirdVehicle, fourthVehicle, nil]             NSLogfirstOtherButtonIndex in the List is i, [actionSheet firstOtherButtonIndex]             [actionSheet showInViewself.view]             [actionSheet release]             break codepre  pWith that said, I dont always know that i will have four strings to create...when I pull back the myVehicleList array, I can use the count method to determine how many variables I have.p  pQuestion  So how does a smart programmer actually solve this problem  Meaning, how do I cycle through a for statement perhaps using the count returned when I check the array to only establish a certain number of strings and set the next string to nilp  pDoes that make sense  I can do IF statements for days, right.  If count  4, then set all four strings.  But if count is 3, I set three strings to the array object values and the fourth to nil.  But if the count is 2, I set two strings to the array object values and the third to nil, and so on.p  pThere has to be a more effective way to dynamically create strings  I guess I could use fast enumeration, but how do I dynamically create a unique string object...p  pI hope I make some sense.p  pthanksp

Then i tried thisp  precodeUserControl control  objB as UserControl  A objA  control as A codepre  pBut problem in this case is objA is null.p  pTo avoid confusion class A and assembly is provided by 3rd party. p  pThanks in advance p
Negative 4527 pI have an XML fragment that I would like to test against a complexType in a schema. The problem is the schema is hugely complex and the fragment I would like to test relates specifically to a single complex type. Is there a way to validate the element against the schema without having to wrap it in a massive mockedup document that validates against the whole schemap

Negative 4527 pIve experimented with the two ways of implementing a leastsquares fit LSF algorithm shown a hrefhttpwww.johndcook.comblog20081020comparingtwowaystofitalinetodata relnofollowherea.p  pThe first code is simply the textbook approach, as described by Wolframs page on LSF. The second code rearranges the equation to minimize machine errors. Both codes produce similar results for my data. I compared these results with Matlabs ppolyfitx,y,1 function, using correlation coefficients to measure the goodness of fit and compare each of the 3 routines. I observed that while all 3 methods produced good results, at least for my data, Matlabs routine had the best fit the other 2 routines had similar results to each other. p  pMatlabs ppolyfitx,y,1 function uses a Vandermonde matrix, V n x 2 matrix and QR factorization to solve the leastsquares problem. In Matlab code, it looks likep  precodeV  [x1,1 x2,1 x3,1 ... xn,1]   this line is pseudocode [Q,R]  qrV,0 p  RQy       performs same as p  Vy codepre  pIm not a mathematician, so I dont understand why it would be more accurate. Although the difference is slight, in my case I need to obtain the slope from the LSF and multiply it by a large number, so any improvement in accuracy shows up in my results. p  pFor reasons I cant get into, I cannot use Matlabs routine in my work. So, Im wondering if anyone has a more accurate equationbased approach recommendation I could use that is an improvement over the above two approaches, in terms of rounding errorsmachine accuracyetc. p  pAny comments appreciated thanks in advance.p

Negative 4527 pI have a tool I would like to release the source to. However, a few features cannot be released as open source parts because of licensing restrictions.

Negative 4527 pIm so glad to have found this site. I hope I can get insightful advice from you guys, the pros in this field. After months of research and speaking with some programmers, I cannot find the complete and objective info I am looking for. p  pMy programming skills are very basic that I dont consider it a professional skill, but more of a hobby skill. However, my work is in the marketing industry and we were thinking of an endeavor an attempt to start our own biz, hooray thats webbased a b2b startup, but targets a very specific group and by invitational membership definitely a niche market and for selective use. Marketing potential aside, my concern is the technical. With the little tech knowhow we have, we try to make up for with research. After months of research, we have 1. decided to use php codeigniter, 2. not to outsource abroad no matter how attractive the cost is and hire 3 people tops to create the site, 3. local people for communication efficiency, superviseable progress  and legal protection. Do you agree with these 3 conclusionsp  pInitially, we were thinking of agreeing to a telecommute arrangement, but I personally prefer they work onsite at our temporary office and do the programming there because my concern is we are building a business that relies 100 on codes, to operate, shouldnt it make sense that the company and no one else not even the programmers have their own copy of the source codes for security purposes. Am I looking at this correctly or am I being paranoid I know the site isnt creating any earthshattering technological breakthroughs, but doesnt it make sense that only the company has the raw codesp  pIf this IS the correct practice officebased, I cannot seem to find standard office protocols for technicalleaning businesses. I have a friend who works for an IT company not  the IT dept, but sales and what hes shared observed from their office procedures were IT personnel especially cannot use mobile phonethumb drivesetc  in the office. Their work computer where they do the programming doesnt have inputoutput ports so you cant copy works done and no internet... so its basically an isolated machine to do dev work. I was thinking of adopting this practice if we go for officebased, but my concern is the internet access which i think programmers need Could you please help me with a setup that can address both concerns can provide programmers with needed resources ie internet but at the same time must prevent pirating of whatever the teams working on, raw codes... please do suggest a sensible and effective setup that wont stifle the programmers and protect us as well...p  pIf anyone could share any more advice re project or office protocols, itll be VERY much appreciated. Thanks in advance Sorry for the lengthp
Negative 4527 pIm using Pythons BaseHTTPRequestHandler class to build a web server.  I want to add an endpoint for WebSockets.  This means that I need to read whatever is available from the handlers rfile, so that I can process messages one by one, as Im receiving them instead of having to read the while input.p  pI tried using different combinations of read eg. with a big buffer, thinking that itd return early with less data if less data was available with no parameter, but then it just means to read until EOF but couldnt get this to work.p  pI can think of two solutionsp  ul lipTo call read1 to read bytes one by one. Id rather not do this, as Im not sure what the buffering semantics are eg. I wouldnt want a syscall per byte read.pli lipTo temporally make the file nonblocking, then attempt a read for a chunk of data, then make it blocking, then attempt a read for 1 byte.  This seems rather messy.  Another option I can think of is to just use nonblocking sockets, but this wouldnt seem to work so well with my current threaded framework.pli ul  pAny ideas of how to get read to return whatever data is availablep

Negative 4527 pIs there any way to retrieve a session from a POJO Or ultimately to retrieve a bean from a POJO.p  pTo clarifyp  pBasically I am creating a bean from a servlet and I need to access the properties of that bean from outside of the web container from a POJO. I cannot pass the request to the pojo and the request is needed to retrieve the session.p  pMore specifically I have a web application that uses the Cactus framework to run JUnit tests from a web interface. However the servlet that invokes the JUnit test runner is compiled in a jar I added extra drop down menus to change settings from which the JUnit test will read from to switch between different environments WLI clusters, so given that the runner servlet is already compiled I cannot modify it to handle the extra parameters from the multiple environments. I have tried the persistence approach of writing to a .dat file fro which the JUnit test will read from by way of a Reader class also I have have tried the bean approach which ultimately was not accessible from the JUnit test.p

Negative 4527 pLet me explain the use case...p  pIn a simple python web application framework designed for Google App Engine, Id like to have my models loaded automatically from a models directory, so all thats needed to add a model to the application is place a file user.py for example, which contains a class called User, in the models directory.p  pBeing GAE, I cant read from the file system so I cant just read the filenames that way, but it seems to me that I must be able to import  from models or some equivalent, and retrieve at least a list of module names that were loaded, so I can subject them to further processing logic.p  pTo be clear, I want this to be done WITHOUT having to maintain a separate list of these module names for the application to read from.p

Negative 4527 pIm working on a project where I would like to reconstruct the 3D locations of feature points Ive extracted from my camera images. The idea is top  ul liMake a camera recording Greyscale information, VGA size 640 x 480li liExtract feature points in the camera frames Im using SIFT for thisli liCorrespond features from frame[k1] with features from frame[k] I intend to use RANSAC for this, more on that later...li liCalculateestimate some relative distance information between these feature points this would be in some x,y,z coordinate systemli ul  pIve read in many papers that RANSAC is an algorithm that is used in reconstruction, with the end result being some kind of point cloud. I want to be able to do just that. However, Ive ran into a few snags, and I hope you guys can help me out with these.p  pThe first snag is that I do not really understand how I would be able to use RANSAC to perform this point correspondence. I understand the concept of RANSAC being a modelfitting tool, I just dont see how it could be used for doing correspondence solving.p  pThe second snag is, assuming I have my correspondence information, how to get some kind of distance information between all these points. Ive read that perspective projection could be used to solve this, and in turn one should try to estimate the Fundamental Matrix. Then do some math magic to be able to get the point cloud. Point is, I dont understand what the actual values in a Fundamental Matrix mean. I know its gives a mathematical relation between the position of 2 cameras or in my case, 2 frames in a video there the camera is moving, and that it exploits epipolar geometry. But besides this, I just dont have a clue what the Fundamental Matrix actually entails. How is this 3x3 matrix capturing the 6DOF of 1 camera with respect to another Also I think the math magic I referred to are some kind of matrix multiplications, but I havent found any informational source to explain me what it does and what the formulation is.p  pTherefore, my question is Could anyone of you point me into the right direction Ive been digging through the references of the papers Ive read so far, but these also give me the we solve this using the RANSAC algorithmline and Im getting more the feeling Im looking in the wrong direction. Is there some nice explanation of these things, perhaps in laymens terms andor with some illustrations In short where should I be looking or where can I find this elusive piece of informationp  pThanks in advance, Xilconicp  pPS Checked wikipedia, but its not helping me much. Also listened to the Fundamental Matrix Song, and its the same story.p

Negative 4527 pIm developing a WPF Prism application, and everything is working fine.

Negative 4527 pI am working with a legal software called Case Aware. You can do limited sql searches and I have had luck in getting Case Aware to pull a specific value from the database. My problem is that I need to create a sql search that returns multiple values but the Case Aware software will only accept one result as an answer. If my query produces a list, it will only recognize the top value. This is a limitation of the software I cannot get around.p  pMy very basic search isp  precodeselect rate From casefininfo where fininfoid  7 and rate0 codepre  pThis should produce a list of 315 rates, which does when the search is run straight from the database. However, when run through Case Aware, only the first rate in the table will pull. I need to pull the values through Case Aware because with Case Aware I can automatically insert the results into a template. Where I work generates hundreds if not thousands a day so doing it manually is a Bp  pstrongI need to find a way to pull all the values from the search into one value. I cannot use XML Case Aware will give an error and I cannot create a temporary table. Again, a Case Aware limitation If possible, I also need to insert a manual return between each value so they are separated in the document I am pulling this information into.strongp  pCase Aware does not have any user manual and you pay for support We do have it but I have my doubts on their abilities. I have been able to easily create queries that they have told me in the past are impossible. I am hoping this is one of those times.p  pstrongIntegrationGirlystrongp  pAddtl FYIp  pI currently have this kludge Pulling each value individually from the database even if it is null and putting each value into a table in the document. 30 separate searches It works but takes much longer for the document to generate and it also leaves a great deal of empty space. Some case have 3 values, most have 510 but we have up to 30 areas for rate because once in a blue moon we need them. This makes the template look horribly junky but that doesnt affect the lawyers who generate the docs since they dont see it, but every time they generate the table they have to take out all the empty columns. With the number of docs we do each day, 1 this becomes time consuming and 2 This assumes attorneys and paralegals know how to take rows out of tables in word.p

Negative 4527 pI am making an editor for a field with numbers. I tried a text field, but since its a Number datatype coming in, it didnt go smoothly  despite recasting strings as numbers etc.. it kept giving me NaN as the value. So I decided it would be best to go with a numeric stepper. p  pWhen I initially loaded it up it would drop all my decimals and only display my numbers as integers.  I changed the stepIncrement to 0.1 and now it does show the decimals a weird requirement imo.. but when I step up it occasionally gives me a value like 17.700000000000003 when I would expect 17.7.  All of the numbers in my data have a single decimal place. I know I can write a dataformatter, but it seems like it shouldnt be necessary in this situation.p  pIs there another way I could deal with thisp

Negative 4527 pI am writing a program that will call a function from an external library, given a list of bitfield flags provided by the end user of my program. I was initially planning on maintaining a lookup table of all the possible flags, but the list of flags varies by platform and I dont have complete documentation for the library. I had planned to use the c preprocessor to include only the defined flags for the current platform in the table, but this is turning out to be hard to maintain because I have to rely on users reporting missing flags for platforms to which I dont have access.p  pI then thought I could allow the users to pass in the flag names as strings. But I cant find a way to test if a macro is defined, given only the string name of the macro. So if a user wanted to set the flag FLAGABC, theyd pass in FLAGABC as an argument and Id have to do some magic to check if ampFLAGABC  NULL. Is this possiblep

Negative 4527 pSo, I need some input refactoring an asp.net c application that is basically a framework for creating dynamic forms any forms. From a high level point of view, there is a table that has the forms, and then there is a table that has all the form fields, where it is one to many between the two. There is a validation table, where each field can have multiple types of validation, and it is a one to many from the form fields table to the validation table.p  pSo the issue is that this application has been sold as the beallendall customizable solution to all the clients. So, the idea is whatever form they want, we can build it jsut using DB configurations. The thing is, that is not always possible, because there is complex relationship between the fields, and complex relationship between the forms themselves. Also, there is only once codebase, and this is for multiple clients  all of whom host it on their own. There is very specific logic for each of the clients, and they are ALL in the same codebase, with no real separation. Sometimes it was too difficult to make it generic, so there are instances where it has hard coded logic as in if formID  XXX then do emem. You can also have nested forms, as in, one set of fields on its own within each form.p  pSo usually, when one client requests a change, we make the change and deploy it to that client  but then another client requests a different change, and we make the change and deploy it for THAT client, but the change from the earlier client breaks it, and its a headache trying to debug, because EVERYTHING is dynamic. There is no way we can rollback the earlier change, because then the other client would be screwed.p  pIts not done in a real 3tier architecture  its a web site with references to a DB class, and a class library. There is business logic in the web site itself, in the class library, and the database stored procs Validation is done in the stored procs.p  pIve been put in charge of reorganizing the whole thing, and these are my thoughtsquestionsp  ol lipI think this is a bad model in general, because one of the things I heard one of the developers say is that anytime any client makes a change, we should deploy to everybody  but that is not realistic, if we have say 20 clients  there will need to be regression testing on EVERYTHING, since we dont know the impact...pli lipThere are about 100 forms in total, and their is some similarity in them not much. But I think the idea that a dynamic engine can solve ALL form requests was not realistic as well. Clients come up with the most weird requests. For example, they have this engine doing a regular data entry form AND a search form.pli lipThere is a lot of preserving state between pages, and it is all done using session variables, which is ok, except that it is not really tracked, and so sessions from the same user keep getting overwritten, and I think sessions should be got rid of.pli lipShould I really just rewrite the whole thing This app is about 3 years old, and there has been lots of testing and things done, and serious business logic implemented, so I hate to get rid of all that joels advice. But its really a mess of a sphagetti code, and everything takes forever to do, and things break all the time because of minor changes.pli ol  pIve been reading Martin Fowlers Refactoring and Michael Feathers working effectively with legacy code  and they are good, but I feel they were written for an application that was slightly better architected, where it is still a 3tiered architecture, and there is some resemblance of logic..p  pThoughtsinput anyonep  pOh, and Helpp

The standard address has these fieldsp  ul liStreet addressli liCityli liStateCountyProvinceli liPostalZIP codeli liCountryli ul  pSome fields are optional, of course e.g. there are no postcodes in Republic of Ireland, for example and there are no statecountyprovince division in many countries.  The issue were having is exactly with the statecountyprovince field as it can be anywhere in the world, we are currently using codeltinput typetextgtcode for this field.  However now users put anything they feel like into it  and we dont even have unified values for where they should be e.g. for Boston, Massachusetts, some user put codeMAcode, some put codeMasscode, some put codeMassachusettscode, some put codeMiddlesex county, Macode, and so on  Im not even talking about all the misspellings.  This makes any statistics by geography almost useless.p  pTo mitigate this issue, were moving to a different way of entering addresses the user must select the country first, then based on the country selection we will display a dropdown codeltselectgtcode element with the list of states, counties, provinces, etc. valid for that country.  If the country doesnt have this division as far as our system is aware, then we revert back to the plain text field.  So far, so good.p  pNow, for the actual question. We have a table in a DB that contains this countystateprovinceetc division per country.

Negative 4527 pI am using SSMS 2008, trying to select just one rowclient. I need to select the following columns codeclientnamecode, codeenddatecode, and codeprogramcode. Some clients have just one client row. But others have multiple.  p  pFor those clients with multiple rows, they normally have different codeenddatecode and codeprogramcode. For instancep  precodeCLIENT       PROGRAM        ENDDATE a            b              c a            d              e a            f              g h            d              e h            f              NULL codepre  pThis is a real simplified version of the actual data. As you will see, different clients can be in the same program d. But the same client cannot be in the same program more than one time.  p  pAlso the tricky thing is that the codeenddatecode can be NULL, so when I tried selecting those clients with  1 row, I added a HAVING statement  1. But this eliminated all of my NULL codeEnddatecode rows.p  pTo sum up, I want one row per client. So those clients with only one row total  those clients listed above with the following criteria p  ul liSelect only the row where either the codeEnddatecode is greatest or NULL. In most cases the codeenddatecode is null for these clients.  li ul  pHow can I achieve this with as little logic as possible  p

Negative 4527 pI was reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions800383whatisthedifferencebetweenmutexandcriticalsectionthis posta on performance differences in C between critical sections and mutexes for a given test case.  Im womdering if there is any further documentation out there that gives performance overheads for the various locking classes for a C application, specifically MFC running on a Windows 32 or 64 bit platformp  pThe reason that Im asking is that the profiler results I get across broad automated tests show a lot of time spent in mutex code.  What Im trying to figure out is how much of this is reasonable delay while waiting for a resource to become available, and how much is due to the implementation and specifics of the locking structure.  Im only dealing with a single process, which includes multiple threads, and am considering changing to critical sections.  Long term automated testing shows that I dont need the timeouts offered by the mutex class.p  pHence the question, is anyone aware of any reference documentation relating to the performance overheads of different MFC locking mechanisms on different Windows platformsp

Negative 4527 pThis is really a general question.p  pI have an ecommerce webapp that I built solo about 4 years ago.  At the time, I made the decision to use Struts as my mvc framework.  As years passed working on other projects, I came to appreciate and feel much more comfortable with the feature set and flexibility offered by Spring MVC.p  pThe service layer is solid, and is built using the spring framework.p  pId like to refactor my current web layer to now use Spring MVC.  But as I have mentioned previously, I wrote the app solo and its more of a side project.  The point being that I do not have time, nor do I want to risk throwing away and completely reengineering the web layer from scratch. p  pSo Im asking the community on what their strategy would be for this refactoring effortp  pIdeally, I would like to tackle pieces at a time, and ultimately mix the two technologies until eventually when I can completely turn off Struts.p  pAll new functionality for my site would best be developed in Spring MVC.p  pThe good thing is that my existing views, which is currently using apache tiles, would not have to change much, with the exception of removing struts tag libraries and replacing them with Spring MVC.p  pOne requirement Id like to keep is that the URLs should not change.p  pIn other words, the ActionServlet and the DispatcherServlet would have to map to separate paths but somehow go to different implementations.p  pFor example, how can I say that mysite.comshowproduct maps to a Spring Dispatcher servlet, but mysite.comshowcategory maps to a Struts action servlet.p  pYour thoughts are appreciated.p

Negative 4527 pIm developing a wicket application currently using wicket 1.5 which is about to get a bloglike feature. Users can post stuff or mark certain business objects as public and other users can comment on these. Only the owning user is allowed to edit these business objects or posts. I know that there are several frameworks providing hideshow or switchpanel functionality based on the current user but is there anything that can be used to do this not only userbased but contextbased as well I know that Ill have to provide my business logic but Id prefer to skip all the repeating boilerplatecode, so even an AOPdrivenapproach might do the trick but since I never worked with that before, I dont know.p  pstrongEditstrong More details on the scenariop  pWithin the application any logged in user can enter lets say recipes which he can flag as public can be read by anyone or private can be read only by himself. Any logged in user can comment on any public recipe either public or private. Private comments can only be read by the commenter and the recipe owner. Only the owner can edit a recipe. Only the commenter can edit his comments. Only the recipe owner or the commenter can delete comments. So basically Im just looking for an idea to expand the classic rolebased security model by a context based role owner and by writing this it seems that the only wicket edge to this would be, that Id prefer a solution based on a framework that integrate well wit wicket or even one where the integration is already provided by wicketstuff.p

Negative 4527 pIm developing a model which holds configuration settings for server options. The number and type of server options change, and I need some input on the proscons of two ways of doing it. Im doing this separate from the rails ActiveRecord database. All my database interactions are going to be manually with the file system.p  pFirst, having the model dynamically create attributes as needed for each server specified. as long as this is possible... Ive never done it beforep  pSecond, creating a single Hash, which has Keys of the server options, and values of the server settings.p  pI think the second would be easier to implement, but Im not sure if it is the right way to go  It seems to be cleaner to go with dynamic attributes.p  pIs there a rule of thumb to go with for thisp

Negative 4527 pI am building a horizontal and vertical scroller for a website i am currently developing.

However the browser only returns me the clientHeight, which is the same as its container divcont1.

Negative 4527 pIve been doing web programming for some time now, and dont consider myself so much of a total newbie but I still dont understand what pathto is. People use that code a lot, and I used to think its just a way to refer to main path. But I started wondering why so many people use that syntax so uniformly, because its confusing if its meant to be NOT taken literally. Most people would actually type in pathto.p  pSo I tried searching for pathto on google, but this is something thats hard to search on a generic search engine, so no luck. So I decided to ask here. Is pathto some kind of jargon that people use to refer to something If yes, what does it exactly refer to If no, then how does it work internallyp
Negative 4527 pSo I know theres a lot of questions regarding this, but so far as I can tell this is a unique situation so I figured I would post it.  Hopefully, this will add some info that may finally give us an answer as to why this is happening to us.  Im getting the error waitfences failed to receive reply 10004003, when my device rotates.  The animation of my views are initiated from p  pcode void willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervaldurationcodep  pIm only getting the error on the new iPad 3.  Ive used the exact same program on an original iPad and iPhones as low as a 3GS.  They all dont get the waitfences error and they all rotate faster than the iPad 3 does.  p  pI use Core Graphics almost exclusively to draw the views.  I also ensure theyre redrawn on a resize so I dont get pixilated views.  If I disable the redraw on resize, I dont get this error but I get stretched views.  If I disable core graphics drawing altogether I dont get the error but, of course, I get black views.  p  pI used the Time Profiler and found out that the hangup was primarily in drawing gradients img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgb4TP.png altenter image description herep  pI have altered the code to fill rather than draw gradients and that does alleviate the problem.  I would say that the gradients are the problem except I do these animations in other situations other than in response to rotation and it works just fine.  p  pI would also like to note that Ive paid special attention to making sure I only animate views that are actually on the screen.  I know that animating views off screen can sometimes cause this error to occur.p  pI have not included the animation codep  pAny ideas as to why this is happening  Especially since its only happening on the iPad 3p  pFor those who will ask, this is the code that performs the animation.

Negative 4527 pIve got a service that runs scans of various servers. The networks in question can be huge hundreds of thousands of network nodes.p  pThe current version of the software is using a queueingthreading architecture designed by us which works but isnt as efficient as it could be not least of which because jobs can spawn children which isnt handled wellp  pV2 is coming up and Im considering using the TPL. It seems like it should be ideally suited.p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4740495maxtasksintplthis questiona, the answer to which implies theres no limit to the tasks TPL can handle. In my simple tests Spin up 100,000 tasks and give them to TPL, TPL barfed fairly early on with an OutOfMemory exception fair enough  especially on my dev box.p  pThe Scans take a variable length of time but 5 minstask is a good average.p  pAs you can imagine, scans for huge networks can take a considerable length of time, even on beefy servers.p  pIve already got a framework in place which allows the scan jobs stored in a Db to be split between multiple scan servers, but the question is how exactly I should pass work to the TPL on a specific server.p  pCan I monitor the size of TPLs queue and say top it up if it falls below a couple of hundred entries Is there a downside to doing thisp  pI also need to handle the situation where a scan needs to be paused. This is seems easier to do by not giving the work to TPL than by cancellingresetting tasks which may already be partially processed.p  pAll of the initial tasks can be run in any order. Children must be run after the parent has started executing but since the parent spawns them, this shouldnt ever be a problem. Children can be run in any order. Because of this, Im currently envisioning that child tasks be written back to the Db not spawned directly into TPL. This would allow other servers to work steal if required.p  pHas anyone had any experience with using the TPL in this way Are there any considerations I need to be aware ofp

Negative 4527 pIm looking for a way to display fractions , , etc within a textfield in flash and my first thought was to use html text and a special fraction font. However this would limit the amount of possible fractions and Im pretty sure I would hit that soon enough. They have to be dynamic with no limitations to both numbers. Now I could create a prepared movieclip with 2 dynamic textfields, however would I be able to embed those in a textfield and also be able to provide them with the 2 parameters needed for the dynamic textfieldsp  pAs far as I know, you can embed images in a textfield using html tags.p  pOr is there another clever approach to thisp  p[edit] I just found out that you can actually use library linkage names in the img src attribute to embed a movieclip. Using the id attribute you can modify it through actionscript, so I guess that would be the way to set both numbers of the fraction. However it seems the movieclips always get aligned to the left or positioned in some other arbitrary way in the textfield which renders this solution useless.p  p[edit2] Thanks Charles for pointing that out, the painful looking stuff I found on the net makes sense now..p

These template files have the naming scheme file.html.php.p  pSo my question, I have user auth on the controller, but what is stopping someone from just hitting my templates in the URL Mind you, these templates are 100 useless because the data isnt being pulled from the database as all my PHPdatabase code is in the controller.p  pOne way to stop this would be to add the authentication check to my template files but then Im checking auth multiple times on a regular page load.p  pAnother way is ive thought about editing my httpd.conf in apache to deny access to these files with a reg expression, just like .htaccess files are blocked with the following.p  precodeltFilesMatch .htgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all     Satisfy All ltFilesMatchgt codepre  pBefore I do this, what do other people do in this situationp

Negative 4527 pI have a Coolbar in VB6 which has has 6 Bands, each of these Bands has a Child of type Toolbar. The user can move these Bands around and set their visibility. I need to restore the settings when the software is restarted, but I am having some problems restoring the orderlocation I can restore the visibility and widths with no problems.p  pThe settings I am having problems restoring are Coolbar.BandsIndex.Position and Coolbar.BandsIndex.NewRow, as both of these properties are readonly.p  pI know I could save the Position and NewRow properties and then create each of the Bands at runtime instead of designtime, and then using the saved properties to determine the order in which to create the Bands. p  pI would prefer not to have to create the Bands at runtime but I suspect it may be the only way to restore these settings. Does anyone know of a way to restore the orderlocation of the Toolbars without having to create the Bands at runtimep  pI can saveload the settings easily enough, so we can skip that step.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advancep

Negative 4527 pFirst, the question do CLR specifications guarantee that the code executing in multiple app domains within the same process will share the same address space By sharing the address space I mean that pointers to memory allocated in one of the app domains will be valid for reading and writing across all app domains hosted inside the same process.p  pConsider this selfcontained example illustrating the question the program allocates a codeWorkercode object in a separate app domain. The codeWorkercode allocates a memory block for 10,000 integers, and fills it in with data. The program then calls across the app domain boundary to obtain the pointer to the allocated block, and verifies that it can read every one of the 10,000 items.p  precodeusing System using System.Reflection using System.Runtime.InteropServices  namespace crossapp      public class Worker  MarshalByRefObject          private readonly IntPtr myData         public const int DataLength  10000         public Worker              Console.Error.WriteLine                 Memory allocation happens in app domain 0             ,   Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.FullName                          myData  Marshal.AllocHGlobalsizeofint  DataLength             unsafe                  var ptr  int myData.ToPointer                 for var i  0  i  DataLength  i                      ptr[i]  2i  1                                                public IntPtr GetData              return myData                   class Program          static void Main              var ad  AppDomain.CreateDomainNew domain             var wrk  Workerad.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap                 Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.FullName             ,   crossapp.Worker                          var data  wrk.GetData             var badCount  0             unsafe                  var ptr  intdata.ToPointer                 for var i  0  i  Worker.DataLength  i                      var expect  2i  1                     if ptr[i]  expect                          Console.Error.WriteLine                             Mismatch in position 0 1  2                         ,   i, expect, ptr[i]                                                  badCount                                                       if badCount  0                      Console.Error.WriteLine                         All 0 items have matched.                     ,   Worker.DataLength                                       else                      Console.Error.WriteLine                         Found 0 mismatches out of 1.                     ,   badCount                     ,   Worker.DataLength                                                                   codepre  pI ran this many times, and it worked every single time. Intuitively it should work after all, app domains are within a single process, so they must share the same virtual address space. However, this feels like an exploit of a feature that Microsoft may take away at any time. Is there something in the specification of CLR that confirms or denies legitimacy of this trick hr In case you are wondering why I am asking such a strange question, I am looking for a way of passing large in gigabytes amounts of data across app domain boundary, with minimal overhead in both space and time. This would be my ideal solution if I could prove its legitimacy.p
Negative 4527 pI have an ios mobile app. The app has a section where it connects with a live tv channel stream.p  pMy problem is that the link to the stream is changed based on the needs they have, but let the app without access until I change the new link in code and go all the way to release an update. This is a big problem because the update process can take long and even when the update is released on appstore, there is no guarantee the user will update.p  pSo I was thinking I could have a link to a page say Jump.html on code that is not the stream link itself but a redirect to the stream link which I can change as I like. So when the link is changed I would change the link in this ideal page Jump.html and the app will connect without problem.p  pBut I have no idea how to do that, I dont even know if it is possible or allowed by apple.p  pCan anyone help me there.p  pThanksp

Negative 4527 pI am getting the aforementioned  error when i try to build for an iPad.Also there is another error. I have my personal mac and the office mac.When i tried to do the project i started doing it on my Personal machine. So my code runs smoothly, builds for an iPad. I can see the app running on the ipad. So i had created a developer provisional certificate and did the testing on the ipad for the above scenario.   Now 2 days later i created a distribution certificate as well.  I copied my project from my personal mac to office mac and connected the same ipad. So i now go into XcodeOrganizerProvisioning profiles and see under status Valid signing identity not found. When i first connected it had only a provisional certificate with that status.I refreshed the provisioning profiles and it asked for my credentials. I did that. It then adds  the distribution profile i created this morning to the list. This also has the status as valid signing identity not found.Then i get this error message No value was provided for the parameter appIdName. I am new to app development.This is infact my very first app. Also while building the project for iPad i get the error as mentioned in the title. I changed in the .plist file the Bundle identifier to match exactly as it said on my project. No typo issues, i crosschecked. In the same .plist file what are the Bundle display Name, Executable Name and Bundle Name to be setRight now i see them on both my macs as product.. etc..I have to see to it that, I can load the app on to ipad from my office machine and personal machine..Do i have to get two certificates, download them, install them for 2 different machinesIt would be great if some one can explain it in detail. Thanks..p

Negative 4527 pThis kind of questions appear periodically. Sorry if this has been covered before, but Im a newbie and couldnt find the appropriate answer. It deals with the correct implementation of communication between classes and activities.p  pI made a gallery app. It has 3 main activities the codeMaincode one, to search for filenames using a pattern a codeThumbcode one, that shows all the images that matched the pattern as thumbnails in a gridview, and a codePhotocode activity, that opens a full sized image when you click a thumb in codeThumbscode. I pass to the codePhotocode activity via an codeIntentcode the filenames an array, and the codepositioncode an codeintcode of the clicked thumb in the gridview.p  pThis third codePhotocode activity has only one view on it a codeTouchImageViewcode, that I adapted for previousnext switching and zooming according to where you shortclick on the image left, right or middle. Moreover, I added a longclick listener to codePhotocode to show EXIF info. p  pThe thing is working, but I am not happy with the implementation... Some things are not right.p  pOne of the problems I am experiencing is that, if I click on the right of the image to see the next in the codePhotocode activity, it switches fine codepositioncode, but when rotating the device the original one at codepositioncode appears.p  pWhat is happening is that codePhotocode is destroyed when rotating the image, and for some reason it restarts again, without obeying codesuper.onCreatesavedInstanceStatecode, loading again the Extras the codepositioncode only changed in codePhotocode, not on the parent activities.p  pI tried with codestartActivityForResultcode instead of codestartActivitycode, but failed...p  pOf course I can do something contrived to save the codepositioncode data, but there should be something conceptual that I am not understanding about how activities work, and I want to do this right.p  pCan someone please explain me what I am doing wrong, which is the best method to implement what I want, and whyp  pThanks a lotp

When I had 5 tasks running very frequently, I was getting an exception on the SaveChanges saying a commit was already in progress. I dont understand how this could be since I am not sharing this context across thread. The only way I could see this happening is if SaveChanges is asynchronous not a blocking call.

Negative 4527 pI have a really strange problem here. I have an application written in JavaFX 2. It works perfectly as a standlone application.But when i try to run it on browser, i get some errors. I am using the HTML file generated by Netbeans and i signed all jar files and including librariesall clients have permission to read and write. If i double click this HTML file, it works perfectly again. But if i try to run it from localhost using IIS, it cant find some files even if they are in exact places.  Interesting part is that It can find files sometimes and works fine, i dont know why but it works some times and it does not work sometimes while i do not change anything. Some clients should also acces this program from browsers. When i try to access this site from other machines it works partially. When it tries to access the files from server it gets errors againit can not read file. Shortly, the application cant find the files while running from other machines and while running from localhost, it can find the files sometimes and it cant find sometimes.I am using latest version of all aplications, tools, libraries etc. Thanks in Advance.p

Negative 4527 pBasically Ive got a codeQGridLayoutcode with a few widgets in it. The important ones are 2 labels, which I use for drawing images to the screen. Well, if the user wants, he can change the resolution of the incoming images, thus, forcing the Labels to resize. p  pLets assume the initial size of the label is code320x240code. The user changes the VideoMode to code640x480code, the label and the entire GUI resizes perfectly. But when the user switches back to code320x240code, the label shrinks, but the LayoutWindow does NOT.p  pIve played around with codesizePoliciescode and codesizeHintscode, and coderesize0,0code, but nothing did the trick. Could somebody help me with thisp  pHere some screenshots to clarify the problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuRart.png altHere, everything is okay img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUpbYw.png altstill, 640 x 480 resizes perfectly img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd0RiY.png altbut here, the layout is too big.p

Negative 4527 pIt seems that the community here agrees that the old clearfix hack has now been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5565668isclearfixdeprecateddepreciated and supersededa by codeoverflowhiddencode. Unfortunately there are situations where even using this method causes problems. For example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netthirtydotje8aS6 relnofollowThisa would look like a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netD9U9N relnofollowthisa if it worked correctly.p  pThe main problem with using the old fashioned codeltdiv classcleargtcode seems to be that it creates a codedivcode element for sole purpose of altering the presentation  which seems to be muddying the ideal of pure semantic markup with presentation.p  pOther than that, though, it appears to work well with all browsers and in all situations which cannot be said for clearfix or codeoverflowhiddencode. p  pAre there any other drawbacks to using codeclearbothcode Is it really that bad to use Or is it just personal preferencep

Negative 4527 pIve created a jQuery plugin which takes a HTML table, makes it sortable, and fixes the header and footer.  See a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaXDzzhttpjsfiddle.netaXDzza for an example click create to create the table.p  pWorks good, but then recently needed to add some padding or margin around the table.  This caused some problems.p  pMy plugin basically replaces the original codelttablegtcode with a codeltdivgtcode which contains a codelttablegtcode for the header, a codeltdivgtcode which intern contains a codelttablegtcode for the body, and a codelttablegtcode for the footer.  My intent was for the user to apply CSS to the original table, and upon using my plugin, the CSS would appropriately transfer.  As stated above, however, I wrap a codeltdivgtcode around the table so that now the margin or padding should be applied to the codeltdivgtcode and not the codelttablegtcode.p  pSo, looks like I need to move any CSS which applies to the exterior of the codelttablegtcode to the codeltdivgtcode such as margin, but then leave any CSS which applies to the interior of the codelttablegtcode such as the row color alone.p  pHow would I do this  Or is there a better way altogether I should be implementing this  Thanksp  pPS.  Please feel free to critique my plugin as it is my first attempt.p

If you do erase, you do get the middle result. I am trying to figure why I am not erasing correctly because, my code segfaults when I call the erase. If I call codeitgtfirstcode, it returns the key of the element I want removed. If I call codeitgtsecondcode, it returns the value of that key. So if I call codemultimap.eraseitcode, It should remove the entire thing, correctp  pEdit 2 In my code, I printed out codeitgtfirstcode and codeitgtsecondcode to make sure that the pointer was pointing to the correct element and it was. When I called codemultimap.eraseitcode, I stopped the loop and printed out the remaining elements in the multimap. It prints the first element correctly, but then the second element is printed something like this output from compilerp  precodeGEWolfC62x322x 14BUYABadWolfCorp1AMstyKrq4X343     X3PlanetExpress1GEqp7L5d5x55d2q77X343X3 codepre  pSo obviously, it is not deleting correctly.

Negative 4527 pI am in the process of writing an HTTP client that basically goes to a webpage and downloads the content to a separate file, which the user defines. I am having trouble not with the act of writing to a file itself, but Im getting a strange problem.  Ill show a couple of the code snippets below, but basically when there is ap  precode    fprintfstdout, s, htmlcontent codepre  pwhere htmlcontent is defined asp  precode    char htmlcontent codepre  pit prints out the entire HTML page information to the standard output.  I can also redirect this output to a file in the command line by saying myfile.txt Yes, I want to compare the text files instead of html files.p  pBut when I do something like thisp  precode    fprintfsavedfile, s, htmlcontent codepre  pwhere savedfile is defined asp  precode    FILE savedfile codepre  pand it is opened like thisp  precode    savedfile  fopenfilename, w codepre  pwhere filename is defined asp  precode    char filename codepre  pand is set equal to the command line argument that corresponds to it.  When I do the second type of fprintf to print it out to my file instead of the standard output, I do not get the same thing and i cant figure out why.  Can anybody help me understand why there would be any difference  If you want me to post the two different programs so you can see them in their entirety just let me know and Ill do that.p
Negative 4527 pIm a bit confused. Sorry for this dumb question, just cant figure out the principles of how it works.p  pAs I can see from the documentation on developer.paypal.com the REST API strongdoesntstrong require to use any iframes on the website So shows example from a hrefhttppaypal.github.io relnofollowhttppaypal.github.ioa samplepaymentsCreatePayment.php in PHP SDK just create approporite objects, make a call with credit card data billing info and all is done or redirect to PayPal for checking out using paypal account. And everything works good with sandbox accounts. As I understand, now I could enter my live credentials, add my bank account, get the new clientid and a secret key, change them in API calls and everything should work in the real environment, rightp  pWe use PayPal Payments Advanced with an iframe custom layout to process payments with some strange SDK now and would like to migrate to this new API. But paypals phone support says that this REST API is eman iframe technologyem, meaning that we should use iframes in any case. Wheres the truth p  pI thought that there were 3 payment solutions in PayPal  Standard, Advanced and Pro. Advanced allows you to use iframes, with a Pro you can use your own form and then just make an API call to proceed with a transaction. So I though that the REST API is the replacement for these solutions of the Classic API. Now I think Im wrong.p  pIn short.. Im confused and would be very thankful if someone explains the point of these solutions and different APIs. Thank youp

Negative 4527 pI have a whole bunch of XML sources I need to read.

Negative 4527 pI created an ASP.NET Dynamic Data Entities Web Application. I have a foreign key to a table containing 6000 records. By default this the Dynamic Data application uses the ForeignKey fieldtemplate.p  pWhen in edit or insert mode the ForeignKey fieldtemplate results in a dropdown with 6000 items. This reduces performance and is not userfriendly at all, so I created a custom FieldTemplate to use jquery autocomplete and a WCF REST enabled webservice returning json to fill the autocomplete list with a maximum of 25 items. The custom fieldtemplate contains 2 textboxes, one for the name, the other one for the id. The textbox for the id is hidden using CSS. When typing in the textbox for the name the autocomplete function narrows down the scope and by selecting a name, the id is set using javascript.p  precodefunction setAutoCompleteCustomerField      if window.location.origin window.location.origin  window.location.protocol    window.location.host      function           input[idlt txtCustomerName.ClientID gt].autocomplete             source function request, response                  .ajax                     url window.location.origin  AutocompleteService.svcCustomerLookup,                     data                          text request.term,                         count 25                     ,                     dataType json,                     contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,                     success function data                          response.mapdata, function item                              return                                  value item.Name,                                 id item.Id                                                                           ,                     error function XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown                          alerterrorThrown                                                   ,             minLength 2,             select function event, ui                  lt txtCustomerId.ClientID gt.valui.item.id                 lt txtCustomerId.ClientID gt.change                             codepre  pI use the ListView pagetemplate to display, edit and insert data. The pagetemplate consists of an UpdatePanel with the GridView and the FormView. When selecting a record in the GridView the data is displayed in the FormView. The DefaultMode of the FormView is set to Edit. When I start typing in the name all works well. I can select other values and update etc. So far so good.p  pI also have an Insert new record linkbutton located within the updatepanel. When clicking this linkbutton, the FormViewMode of the FormView is set to Insert.p  precodeprotected void lnkInsertNewClickobject sender, EventArgs e      FormView1.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Insert  codepre  pWhen in Insert mode the same custom FieldTemplate is loaded but the autocomplete is no longer working.

The setAutoCompleteCustomerField function is executed. However, its seems that the execution comes to early. When I place an alert within the setAutoCompleteCustomerField function to display the id of the textbox for the customer name the value null is displayed. This indicates that the element is not yet loaded.p  precodealertlt txtCustomerName.ClientID gt.attrid codepre  pHow can I overcome this issue How can I make sure that all elements are loaded before

Negative 4527 pI know that there are available codePropertiescode for ListView to change the common styles but I just want to test this. That is for example the codeView  View.LargeIconcode applies the style codeLVSICON  0code to the codeListViewcode or codeGridLines  truecode applies the style codeLVSEXGRIDLINES  1code to the codeListViewcode. I would like to test with codeCreateParamscode. I think using codeGetWindowLongcode and codeSetWindowLongcode Win32 functions would be OK, but for convenience, as far as I know, codeCreateParamscode can change the style of a control. But this time with a codeListViewcode, I cant make it work, it has no effect at all, I wonder if codeListViewcode is a special case. Here is my codep  precodepublic class CustomListView  ListView              protected override CreateParams CreateParams        get         CreateParams cp  base.CreateParams        cp.Style  3 Apply LVSLIST View as List        return cp              codepre  pOnly codeLVSEXGRIDLINES  1code makes some effect but the effect is not codeGrid lines are drawn on the ListViewcode but the codeBorder becomes thicker and looks like 3Dbordercode.

Negative 4527 pIm writing a game in java and all is working more or less well, as you would expect when coding, but one issue I have come across is reading the image and sound files into the game. I wrote a method that works really well within Eclipse, but as soon as I try to test it in a runnable jar exported using Eclipse my game gets stuck on the loading screen because it cant read the files. I realized the problem there being that you cannot create File objects within a Jar, you have to use streams. This could work, but the imagessounds are located within folders and Im not very sure how you can read files within a folder with streamsi.e not knowing the amount of files. Because of this I have tried to rewrite the method using the ZipInputStream I found this as recommended when looking for solutions prior to posting this. This is what the method looks like nowp  precodeimageMap  new HashMapltString, BufferedImagegt     String imagebase  images     CodeSource src  PlatformerCanvas.class.getProtectionDomain.getCodeSource     ifsrc  null              URL jar  src.getLocation         try                      ZipArchiveInputStream zip  new ZipArchiveInputStreamjar.openStream             ZipArchiveEntry ze  null             whileze  zip.getNextZipEntry  null                              System.out.printlnze.getName                 ifze.getName.startsWithimagebase ampamp ze.getName.endsWith.png                                      loading                     imageMap.putze.getName.replaceAllimagebase  , , ImageIO.readthis.getClass.getResourceze.getName                                           zip.close             System.out.printlnFinished Loading Images                  catch IOException e                      e.printStackTrace               codepre  pHowever, this completely skips over the while loop because getNextZipEntry return null. I tried using the base Zip archive libraries, but someone recommended the Apache Commons libraries, but neither worked. My Jar setup is thisp  precodeJar gamegameClasses imagesimageFiles soundssoundFiles whateverOtherFoldersEclipseCreated codepre  pSo my question is this Why isnt this current method working and how do I fix it Or, how can I load the imagessounds in a different way that works I have looked at many other questions and tried many different things, but none worked for me.p

Negative 4527 pright now I have a vb.net program that reads in an excel file and displays the contents into a datagridview. My goal is to have code that tells the user if there is any value besides 1 or blank in the cell. Then I want to supply a default value of blank to the datagridviewcell.

Negative 4527 pWe have a Smartphone App that downloads blobs from Googles blobstore and checksums them. Basically the blobs are immutable until replaced by a new version with a new filename, perfect for caching.p  pBUT In rare circumstances 3 times in one month so far the blobs lost some bytes.

Our compressor leaves 8 newlines more than its evil twin somewhere in the web. p  pOnly one request for each file made it to our server logs, even when we tried multiple times.p  pSo far I have not found that it is allowed by any cache spec to modify files that should be cached.

Negative 4527 pI have one doubt that one perl process is writing in one file and same file is being read by a java thread. Suppose if that thread access that file to read it at the time when perl process is writing in it then , will thread will go to waiting state or will be able to read it. It it goes to waiting state then , will it return back to running state or will go for waiting state forever. How actually 2 different process will do it.p  pHi , Actually i have 2 process. one is perl process , which is slower one , which updates the file continuously whenever one task gets complete to update status of that task as successful or failed.  Other is Java process which reads from this file continuously whether task status is successful or failed. So since java process is  fast process as it need not to wait for any task to complete , so now what will be scenario. Will this java thread will go to waiting state or terminating state when file is being locked by perl process for writing. OS is linux.p

DisposedCancelled client requests still dont trigger the server request token to flag though.p  pFor some background, I am trying to implement longpolling, where the server suspended the request thread until some data arrived to return to the client, or if the request is cancelled.  To implement this, my suspending loop will fall out if the cancellation token is flagged.  If its not flagged, the request thread will NEVER end unless there is something to return.  Since the token is never flagged, my server could end up with an infinite number of requests that never end.  p

Negative 4527 pI have a survey dataset identified by household id and person id. Theres a question in the survey about members of the household with disability. Due to the framing of the question, I noticed that the characteristics of the person with disability e.g. age, educ, etc were encoded to other members data. p  pWe were tasked to do logistic regression where the dependent variable is the codedisabilitycode variable. When I run codelogitcode in Stata, I get codeerror 2000code saying that there are no observations. What am I supposed to do Should I transfer the observations from the other members profile to the person with disability profile This might be the reason why I get the error code in Stata.p

Negative 4527 pWhy I ask is that my program uses 3rd party software that sometimes leaves behind orphan processes that have no link back to my program or the 3rd party process.  These orphan processes start to add up and consume tons of resources over time.  I would like to kill them off periodically, but in order for me to do that, I need to know for sure they were created by my program and not some other program.  I have viewed the orphan processes in Process Explorer and when looking at the properties of the process, I see a field called Current Directory.  The current directory for the orphaned process is the install directory of my program.  This would give me reassurance I am killing a process created by my program.p  pSince these processes are created by a 3rd party, I need to just kill them after they are created by running taskkill on them or something.  Is there a way to figure out the current working directory of a process using out of the box windows commands in a batch file  If this can be done through wmic queries that would be preferable, but I cannot seem to find the current working directory when using wmic.  I assume if Process Explorer is able to obtain this info, I should be able to get it too through some batch commands.p

For example, is it possible to have a public member function template and a private specialization of that templatep

Negative 4527 pI have a window containing a JScrollArea, which contains a JPanel which contains a JTextArea.  When I resize the window to make it larger, the layout updates perfectly, but if I make the window smaller, the JPanel does not shrink its contents.  I attempted to add a ComponentListener on the JScrollArea to resize the JPanel based on the new size of the viewport, but this seems to defeat the purpose of the vertical scroll bar.p  pUPDATE The idea here is that the JScrollArea will contain a JPanel since it can only contain one component for its viewport, and within that JPanel I will be adding multiple JPanels containing components that describe processes that are running to the user.  Since there could be any number of these processes running, I need to have some kind of scroll bar functionality available.  Hence the component hierarchy Im using below.p  pThe desired behavior here is that the window can be resized larger or smaller and the text area will wrap its contents accordingly, and a vertical scroll bar will appear if the contents of the JPanel are larger vertically than the window.

Negative 4527 pWe are using a hrefhttpsgithub.comcollectiveideadelayedjob relnofollowDelayedJoba to run tasks in the background because they could take a while, and also because if an error is thrown, we still want the web request to succeed.p  pThe issue is, sometimes the job could be really big changing hundreds or thousands of database rows and sometimes it could be really small like 5 db rows. In the case of the small ones, wed still like to have it run as a delayed job so that the error handling can work the same way, but wed love to not have to wait roughly 5 seconds for DJ to pick up the job.p  pIs there a way to queue the job so it runs in the background, but then immediately run it so we dont have to wait for the worker to execute 5 seconds laterp  pstrongEditstrong Yes, this is Ruby on Rails p

Negative 4527 pI am trying to reduce the memoryconsumption of a python dict, which in my case serves as a codewordgtdocumentidcode inverted index. Each codewordcode is hashed as an integer, which takes up 24 bytes.p  pI was wondering if I can convert each element within codedictcodes values and each key within codedictcode to a bitarray instead. Ive noticed that the max value of any encountered codeintcode is less than code222code, so I can maybe just allocate a bitarray of size 22.p  pHow can this be done So far Ive seen a hrefhttpsgmpy2.readthedocs.orgenlatestintro.html relnofollowcodegmpy2codea and a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypibitarray relnofollowcodebitarraycodea libraries, as well as a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcpputilitybitset relnofollowcodestdbitsetcodea in the C stdlib, which I can use with Cython. Ive read from this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20845686pythonbitarrayperformantposta that codebitarraycode is not as fast as codegmpycode. In codegmpycode, I am not sure how to set the size. Finally, I wonder if the memoryoverhead of codegmpycode or codebitarraycode objects in Python is worth it, when I can just use codestdbitsetcode, which probably uses the least memory of all.p

Then when the button is pressed it takes the last known location and creates a proximity alert around that. my problem however is that when i press the button on both the emulator and the real phone it quickly crashes and i cant seem to find a reason why. is there an infinite loop i am some how missing if there is a way to see the error messages from my phone that would also be very helpful.p  pHere is my codep  pMainActivity.javap  precodepackage com.YdidApplications.shotgun  import android.location.Location import android.location.LocationListener import android.location.LocationManager import android.os.Bundle import android.app.Activity import android.app.PendingIntent import android.content.Intent import android.view.Menu import android.view.View import android.view.View.OnClickListener import android.widget.ImageButton import android.widget.Toast  public class MainActivity extends Activity implements LocationListener      private ImageButton flagButton     LocationManager lm     double lat0,long10    Defining Latitude amp Longitude     float radius5                         Defining Radius     Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain           lmLocationManager getSystemServiceLOCATIONSERVICE         lm.requestLocationUpdateslm.GPSPROVIDER,                  10000, Update every 10 sec                 10, LocationListener this         flagButton  ImageButton findViewByIdR.id.FLAG         onFlagPress          public void onFlagPress              flagButton.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener                 Override                public void onClickView v                     location                                     public void location               lmLocationManager getSystemServiceLOCATIONSERVICE         lm.getLastKnownLocationLOCATIONSERVICE         Intent i new Intentcom.adnan.proximityalert           Custom Action         PendingIntent pi  PendingIntent.getBroadcastgetApplicationContext, 1, i, 0         lm.addProximityAlertlat, long1, radius, 1, pi          Override     public void onLocationChangedLocation location          lat location.getLatitude         long1  location.getLongitude         Toast.makeTextnull, lat, long1, 0          Override     public void onProviderDisabledString provider           TODO Autogenerated method stub           Override     public void onProviderEnabledString provider           TODO Autogenerated method stub           Override     public void onStatusChangedString provider, int status, Bundle extras           TODO Autogenerated method stub         codepre  pProximityReciever.javap  precodepackage ProximityReciever  import android.content.BroadcastReceiver import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.content.IntentFilter import android.location.LocationManager import android.widget.Toast  This is the Reciever for the Brodcast sent, here our app will be notified if the User is   in the region specified by our proximity alert.You will have to register the reciever   with the same Intent you broadcasted in the previous Java file     Author Adnan A M      public class ProximityReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver    Override  public void onReceiveContext arg0, Intent arg1     TODO Autogenerated method stub    The reciever gets the Context amp the Intent that fired the broadcast as arg0 amp agr1     String kLocationManager.KEYPROXIMITYENTERING   Key for determining whether user is leaving or entering     boolean statearg1.getBooleanExtrak, false   Gives whether the user is entering or leaving in boolean form    ifstate     Call the Notification Service or anything else that you would like to do here    Toast.makeTextarg0, Welcome to my Area, 600.show   else    Other custom Notification     Toast.makeTextarg0, Thank you for visiting my Area,come back again , 600.show          codepre  pAny advise would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Loganp

So my algorithm to do so is p  precodenamespace Final       public Class A ltTgt where T IComparable ltTgt               public Class Node                      public T symbol This symbol has to be generic type because symbol may be intlonguint etc. on 3264 bit archtecture.             public Node next             public int freq                  public Node Front          public Astring[] args its a constructor                      Front  null             usingvar stream  new BinaryReaderSystem.IO.File.OpenReadargs[0]                                                   while stream.BaseStream.Position lt stream.BaseStream.Length                                         Func lt byte, T gt converter  b  gt new Tb                     byte byteValue  stream.ReadByte                     T processingValue  converterbyteValue here is the problem                     Node pt, temp                     pt  Front                     while pt  null                                              if pt.symbol  processingValue here is the problem                                                      pt.freq                             break                                                  temp  pt                         pt  pt.next                                                                stream.Close                   public class MyClass              public static void Mainstring[] args                      A ltTgt ObjSym  new A ltTgt args object creation                        codepre  pPlease pay attention there are codethree classcode codeClass Acode,codeClass Nodecode containing symbol and codeClass MyClasscode containing main function where i create codeobjectcode and inside class A i have my codeconstructorcode.p  pNow what i am trying to achieve since yesterday is, I am trying to make symbol as generic data type, i mean the symbol may be codeintcodecodeuintcodecodelongcode etc. on 3264 bit architecture.Also please note that i am reading the symbols from codeBinary Filecode strongat codesole argumentcodestrong and the symbol in binary are of the form 11010101 etc..p  pI would really appreciate if some one could please correct my algorithm by editing it in achieving my target of making symbol as codegenericcode type on which i am stuck since yesterday.

Negative 4527 pHy everyone, I know there are a lot of posts regarding closing sessions but I have kind of a strange situation. So, basically. You come to my page, and You dont have to log in. I immediately start a session and grab Your sessionid. On the page, You can upload an image and enter some data, at which point when you click the save button a php script makes a folder named as Your sessionid and puts the image and data as a generated html page into that folder. Now, I want to be able to delete that folder once when You live my page. Is that possible If not, is it ok to delete the folder after lets say 24 hours I know I can use sessiondestroy to destroy the session, but how can I first delete Your folder and then close the session Any advice Thanks in advancep

Negative 4527 pI have a problem with trying to keep my character from rolling over, yet allow it to pitch and yaw. The suggestions I have seen have been to lock different axis, but no matter if I lock the x, y, or z axis I always run into a situation where the character can fall over. The best I can get is to lock both the y and z axis. This allows the character to change pitch to conform to the terrain. But, again, if I turn left or right while going up or down a hill and I can roll the character over.p  pHere is my current code for movement in case it helps. I have no other code and my rigid body is all defaults. I have a mesh collier for the character set to convex but defaults otherwise.p  pAny suggestions on how to make this work Heres a live demo of y and z axis being locked. Just waltz up the hill and hang a left or right and youll fall over.

Negative 4527 pI have a very strange issue that has been occurring to a few users of my app. One of the users actually described the issue to me.p  pMy app downloads magazine data to the device to allow for offline reading. This means that users can sometimes have around 10 gigs downloaded to the device.p  pThe problem this user experienced and a few others have too is that randomly all sandbox data gets deleted from the app included core data files. The user told me that he was downloading something in a different app and got the Storage Almost Full  You can manage your storage in Settings popup message. p  pHe went to the settings app and went to General  Usage. He then saw the app was using around 13 gigs of data. While he was in that list he said every time he went out of the Usage tab, then back in the apps data was getting smaller and smaller. Until eventually the app said it was using 0mb.p  pWhen he logged back into the app all his data was deleted and core data was also removed which lead the app to think he was a completely new user with no data downloaded.p  pI then ran some tests on my own where I made sure my device only had 100mb of space available. I then started downloading in the app. The warning message popped up alerting me I was running out of space and I ignored it and continued downloading. I have now downloaded about 1.5 gigs of data and am still downloading and the device seems like it is freeing up space somewhere else to make room for my downloads.p  pIve searched far and wide and have found no one else ever experiencing a problem like this. So my questions arep  ol liHas anyone else every experienced this issue beforeli liDoes Apple have a policy that will remove app data from the app that uses the most space if the device is running out of spaceli liIs there an algorythm that decides which app will get cleared when space is running outli liIs there a way to tell the OS not to remove data when running out of spaceli ol  pAny help would be appreciatedp

So Ive got this method thats meant to use the preferences with the value its been given by the last method.p  pI have the  preferences.SELLOC etc commented out because it doesnt recognise .SELLOC as preferences only gets that value from the web service from the previous method.p  precode       public ServiceResponse GetTrainMovementsstring preferences              JavaScriptSerializer jscript  new JavaScriptSerializer         Dictionaryltstring, objectgt dict  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt        var pref  jscript.DeserializeltDictionaryltstring,objectgtgtpreferences         ServiceResponse sR  new ServiceResponse        GMGeniusMobileServices.GeniusMobileServicesClient client  new GMGeniusMobileServices.GeniusMobileServicesClient        GMGeniusMobileServices.CTrainMovementList trainList  new GMGeniusMobileServices.CTrainMovementList         trainList.SelectionCriteria.Routes  preferences.SELLOC        trainList.SelectionCriteria.Sectors  preferences.SELSEC        trainList.SelectionCriteria.Headcodes  preferences.SELHEAD        trainList.SelectionCriteria.IncAfterRouteLoc  preferences.SELINCAFTERLOC        trainList.SelectionCriteria.MaxReports  preferences.SELMAXREP        trainList.SelectionCriteria.MaxAge  preferences.SELMAXAGE        trainList.SelectionCriteria.MaxFutureMins  preferences.SELMAXFUTURE         sR.DataResponse  jscript.Serializeclient.GetTrainMovementstrainList        sR.Message  Success         return sR       codepre  pSo I figured to deserialize the data so I can use it in that previous method, I need to pass it to that method using another Ajax method.

Negative 4527 pOK, so signals and slots allow loose coupling connectivity between an object and method to another object and its method. This is fine but these signal slots objects exist as public members of a parent class and so their exposure undermines the loose coupling to create tightly coupled code. This is rather a negative thing. Shouldnt signals be made private so the parent class handles the connectiondisconnection of the signalp

Negative 4527 pIm studying to get a masters degree in CS and want and need to learn to use Intel intrinsics.

Negative 4527 pI currently have a map that is 1600 x 1600 stored in MySQL2,560,000 records.  Im rendering a simple 25x25 map out to users for interaction.  Users can claim tiles on this map.  Id like to be able to calculate the number of open faces for tiles owned by a given user.  I can divide this out by the total tiles owned to determine an arbitrary efficientcy rating.p  pAll map coordinates are simply stored as XY values. p  pIm looking for something that can potentially process an array of said XY values and determine how many open faces are accessible for each owned group.  For example...p  precode0  player x x x x x x x 0 x x x x x x x 4 open faces  x x x x x  x x 0 x x  x x 0 x x  x x x x x  6 open faces  x x x x x  x x x 0 x x x 0 x x x x x x x  8 open faces codepre  pRight now Im doing some inefficient array looping to calculate this out.  I have a simple counter, then Im looping through an array of all values and am looking for values 1 in each direction of X and Y to reduce the count.  Each loop either adds 04 to the total counter based on the number of finds.  The inherent problem with this method is that as a group grows, it will take longer and longer to calculate out.  Since its possible for one group to consume 20,000 points o rmore, its quite a burden.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4527 pI have the below text in Definite Guide Hadoop in pg 206.p  pBefore it writes to disk, the thread first divides the data into partitions corresponding to the reducers that they will ultimately be sent to. Within each partition, the background thread performs an inmemory sort by key, and if there is a combiner function, it is run on the output of the sort. Running the combiner function makes for a more compact map output, so there is less data to write to local disk and to transfer to the reducer.p  pSo with this understanding, Can I sort the order as Mapper, partitioner, shufflesort, Combinerp

Negative 4527 pIm playing around with the netwire package trying to get a feel for FRP, and I have a quick question.p  pStarting with the following simple wires, Im able to emit an event every 5 seconds approxp  precodemyWire  Monad m, HasTime t s gt Wire s  m a Float myWire  timeF  myWire  Monad m, HasTime t s gt Wire s  m a Int myWire  fmap round myWire  myEvent  Monad m, HasTime t s gt Wire s  m a Event Int myEvent  periodic 5 . myWire codepre  pThis is pretty nice and straight forward, but what I want to do next is map each event produced to a wire, that I can then watch update. I have an accumulator function like the followingp  precodeeventList  Monad m, HasTime t s              gt Wire s  m a Event [Wire s  m a Int] eventList  accumE go [] . myEvent   where go soFar x  f x  soFar         f x  for 10 . pure x gt pure 0 codepre  pI then introduce a new wire that will inhibit until the codeeventListcode starts triggering events, like sop  precodemyList  Monad m, HasTime t s gt Wire s  m a [Wire s  m a Int] myList  asSoonAs . eventList codepre  pSo Ive gone from events to a wire containing a list of wires. Finally, I introduce a wire to step each of these wires and produce a list of resultsp  precodemyNums  Monad m, HasTime t s gt Wire s  m [Wire s  m a Int] [Int] myNums  mkGen  dt wires gt do   stepped lt mapM w gt stepWire w dt  Right undefined wires   let alive  [ r, w  Right r, w lt stepped ]   return Right map fst alive, myNums  myNumList  Monad m, HasTime t s gt Wire s  m a [Int] myNumList  myNums . myList codepre  pAnd finally, I have my main routine to test it all outp  precodemain  testWire clockSession myNumList codepre  pWhat I expect to see is a growing list, where each element in the list will show its creation time for 10 seconds, after which the element will show a zero. What Im getting instead is a growing list of static values. For example, what I expect to see after a few steps isp  precode[0] [5, 0] [10, 5, 0] [15, 10, 0, 0] codepre  pand so on. What Im actually seeing isp  precode[0] [5, 0] [10, 5, 0] [15, 10, 5, 0] codepre  pSo I know my accumulator function is working every event created is being converted into a wire. But what Im not seeing are these wires emitting different values over time. My statement codefor 10 . pure x gt pure 0code should be switching them over to emitting 0 after the time has elapsed.p  pI am still new to FRP, so I may be fundamentally misunderstanding something important about it probably the case.p

I get the same result, the first lightwindow works but the second one does not.p  pIm not seeing any js errors on the console either.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strong This isnt an ideal solution, but i did find a way to make this work.  I had to use unique IDs on each slider in order to get the lightbox to work if multiple sliders were on the same page using the same ID value.  In this case, I was using carousellinks for all of the sliders.  I guess you cant share the same ID for sliders across the board and get this lightbox to work p  pI also moved the javascript code to be right after the carousel in the module template page.  I removed it for now from my site.js file.p  pIm not looking for a way to optimize the code so i can put it in my site.js.  Ill try to grab that ID value by using the class on each carousel.  Ill report back if i can get that to work.p  pstrongUPDATE 2  OMGstrong Could the problem i was having when the lightbox only worked with the first instance of the lightbox be because i was an ID instead of a CLASS as my selector for the lightbox  I changed to the CLASS and now they are all working.  p

Negative 4527 pI am trying to work out how to get around some particularly nasty 403 errors that involve my domain name being referenced incorrectly missing its www part and end with it missing forward slashes. Let me explain. I have something like this at the moment.p  precodeRewriteCond HTTPHOST example.com [NC] RewriteRule . httpwww.example.com1 [L,R301] codepre  pand that all works fine and dandy. All calls to example.com get converted to www.example.com. Great. Further down I deal with some pages that no longer exist at all but which used to be found in many different folders. Heres an example.p  precodeRewriteRule reference.php. index.html [L,NC,R301] codepre  pThis works perfectly too. Having taken care of that I am seeing the following strange 403s cropping up aplenty and nothing in my .htaccess file can handle it. Lets say I DO have a file called test.htm and its in a folder called demo, so the url www.example.comdemotest.htm is perfectly fine. What I am seeing thats causing the 403s is stuff like this example.comdemotest.htm so, same as above but just missing the www. What happens then is amazingly odd to me. It changes the url to the followingp  precodehttpwww.example.comdemotest.htm codepre  pNotice how the www is added but the forward slash is now missing in front of the demo folder. Any ideas on what needs to be done to address this behaviourp  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 4527 pIm developing a WatchKit app for the Apple Watch. I finished the app originally when the first beta was out back in NovDec. p  pI recently upgraded the the final release and somethings in WatchKit changed as to be expected. I had to fix couple lines of code here and there since they changed how the app views start up. p  pAnyway, after fixing the issues I noticed that my codeWKInterfaceTablecode displays and scrolls emalmostem correctly. The last row in the table gets cut off as indicated in the screenshot below. Also, the scrollbar is very short  shorter than it should be also in the screenshot. Anyone else experiencing this p  h2img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5uSKY.png altHeadingh2  pemIn the screenshot, the app has about 10 rows, I just scrolled way to the bottom with a bit of an extra pull just to show the cutoff from the last row... Notice the bottom of the row  and the scrollbar at the top right.emp  pIve included extra screenshots that may be helpful. I researched some tutorials on codeWKInterfaceTablecode and theyre not really doing anything different than I am in the Interface Builder. Im lost here. p  pIm not making ANY UI modifications in code. Im just letting WatchKit handle the UI as much as possible without any intervention from me. p  pThanksp  pOther Screenshots p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7SHzS.png altenter image description herep
Negative 4527 pI am trying to do a batch upload of PDFs. Their names are structured like this p  precodemmyyyy AAA BBBB.pdf codepre  ul liAAA is the 3 letter codePipeNameAbreviationcodeli liBBBB is the 3 or more lettersnumbers codeLocationAbbreviationcodeli ul  pIn the plunker you will see the user will select the Company and Date in the view. They will then select the PDFs. What I need to do is compare the codePipeNameAbrcode of the file with the codePipeNameAbrcodes in the database and then assign the correct codePipeIdcode amp codePipeNamecode to the formdata. This will be a consistent number of letters, 3. I also need to the do the same thing with the codeLocationcode, except I need the codeLocationIdcode amp codeLocationAbrcode for the formdata. The difference is the length of lettersnumbers.

Negative 4527 pIn my AIR mobile application I am trying to resize my application when the softkeyboard is activated so that the bottom of my application will not be covered by the keyboard. From what I have read this is suppose to be the default behavior but I have never been able to get it to work and I have tried everything I have found online, instead the keyboard overlays ontop of the application.p  pI then decided I would resize my application myself based on the height and y position of the softkeyboard only to find out that the built in AIR methods for determining the height and y position of the keyboard are not correct YAY. I even tried using a 3rd party ANE for determining the screen height by FreshPlanet and their code does not always return correct values either. I feel like this shouldnt be that hard to figure out but I am stuck. Please helpp  pstrongTLDRstrong How can I resize my application to be the remaining screen space when the softkeyboard is activatedp

However, I have just been asked if I could amend the installer so that if any file I install is changed, it is not removed by the uninstaller.p  pAt first glance there is no obvious solution apart from writing the installed file paths to the registry along with their timestamps, and then checking this information via the uninstall code, removing only the files that have not had their timestamps updated. p  pIs there any existing NSIS scriptplugin I can use to do this or anything obvious that I am missingp  pThanks for your time.p

I have been able to enter the CF into the Array of data that I have in my original workbook.  Its not as simple as putting it into a table, but by manually selecting the range in each column and inputting the CF I have made it work.p  pI also wasnt sure if the formatting would carry through to the new worksheet as I have used the Paste Special command to convert the array formula to values in the new sheet.

Negative 4527 pC offers multiple ways to perform asynchronous execution such as threads, futures, and async.p  pIn what cases is async the best choicep  pI have read many articles about the emhowem and emwhatem of async, but so far I have not seen any article that discusses the emwhyem.p  pInitially I thought async was a builtin mechanism to create a future. Something likep  precodeasync int foo return ..complex operation..  var x  await foo dosomethingelse barx codepre  pWhere call to await foo would return immediately, and the use of x would wait on the the return value of foo. async does not do this. If you want this behavior you can use the futures library a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryFf963556.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryFf963556.aspxap  pThe above example would instead be something likep  precodeint foo return ..complex operation..  var x  Task.Factory.StartNewltintgt gt foo dosomethingelse barx.Result codepre  pWhich isnt as pretty as I would have hoped, but it works nonetheless.p  pSo if you have a problem where you want to have multiple threads operate on the work then use futures or one of the parallel operations, such as Parallel.For.p  pasyncawait, then, is probably not meant for the use case of performing work in parallel to increase throughput.p

Negative 4527 pI am trying to redesign an existing application for Android L. Unfortunately many components from the support or design libraries not really look like those in Googles Material Design Guideline. However, one problem I faced is when adding a Spinner to a ScrollView.p  pWhen clicking the spinner near the edge of the screen, instead of opening upwards it scrolls down. It actually just pushs downwards which doesnt look smooth. But this does not happen if the keyboard is opened on the extern mobile. With the keyboard opened it adapts perfectly to the remaining space above the keyboard even with scrolling.p  pSpinnerp  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt     ltSpinner xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         androidididspinner1         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidspinnerModedropdown         gt codepre  pSo now my question Is there a possibility to fix this Like telling the spinner to orientate at the real visible screen and its relative positionp  pAnd by the way, if theres someone who knows how to create the real material style spinner like a hrefhttpsmaterialdesign.storage.googleapis.compublishmaterialv4materialextpublish0B3321sZLoPHTS1LdnhrTl9TRzgcomponentsbuttonsotherbuttons060203MobileDropdownsxhdpi006.webm relnofollowthis one from Googles Material Design Guidelineap  pit would be even nicer than the standard spinner.
