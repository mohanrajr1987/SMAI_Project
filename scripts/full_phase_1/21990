Positive 21990 pMy Understanding on ARM MMU is low and trying to understand how Page table is organised in ARM MMU.p  pPage table is created at system boot up time and can be thought of as linear one dimensional array where each entry is 4 byte long but I dont understand what is 1 MB SECTION corresponds to in Page tablep  pIf we have three level of page table, would our first level page tablePGD contains this 1 MB section or would it 1 MB section be only  part of third level page table PTEp  pAlso what it meant by following statementp  pThe start of the page table is 0x40200000, each entry is 4 bytes long and each entry corresponds to a 1MB section of memory. The first entry in the page table 0x40200000 represents what happens when you try to access memory between the range of 0x00000000 to 0x00100000, the second entry 4 bytes into the table at 0x40200004 represents the memory range 0x00100000 to 0x00200000, etc.p  pTherefore to find the page table associated with area of memory 0x40200000 to 0x402000001MB which is the 402nd MB of memory  you need to traverse the page table list by 402 entries  but each entry is 4 bytes long therefore you need to time this number by 4.p

Positive 21990 pI am trying to program a kernel module that copy the elf of the process that called the module using ioctl to a buffer in the module.p  pSo far i managed to get the location of the elf in the memory by using procpidexe  but i need the size of the file in order to copy it to kernel space.p  pI also have access to the elf header of the mentioned file but i could figure a way to calculate the size using the information from the header.p  pSince i cant use functions like stat is there a way to calculate the mentioned file size when programming in kernel spacep  pThe unique part of my question that i need to calculate it under the constraints that kernel programming impose such is the inability to use system calls such as stat p

Positive 21990 pIs it possible to use the Haswell CPU feature PEBS Precise Event Based Sampling directly from a Linux userspace process instead of using a kernel interfacep  pI have succeeded in accessing performance counters from userspace using the RDPMC instruction and only using the kernel for WRMSR. This makes me very happy.p  pNow I want to also access PEBS. To do this I need to use the MSR IA32DSAREA to supply a debug store memory area.

I can also resolve the physical address of this memory via procfs. However, I am not sure whether either the virtual or physical address is suitable as the linear address to supply for the MSR.

Positive 21990 pI was reading Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love. I came across a line which I am unable to understand fullyp  pstrongcodeThe kernel source is installed in usrsrclinux.

Positive 21990 pI have a Linux kernel module which calculates network packet statistics among several CPUs in kernel address space. Periodically I clear the corresponding memory chunk and strongly need this action to take immediate effect for all CPUs, otherwise it will distort the subsequent statistics values.

Thus I need to manually flush data caches of all CPUs just after zeroing the memory.p  pSo what should I place just after my clearing procedurep  precodememsetptr, 0, size  whats going here codepre

Positive 21990 pI am trying to understand how the Android kernel update works.p  pAt the site a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.com relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.coma I could notice that there are many people working in the Android OS source code. I saw that patches that fix bugs and vulnerabilities are committed there as well.p  pI am working in an app that aims to diagnose a device based on its metadata, as Android version, kernel version, build number,  build timestamp unix epoch timestamp, and so on.p  pThere are a vulnerability that affects several Android versions, including the version running in my device Jelly Bean 4.1.2, however, according to the Trustable by Bluebox app, my device is protected against this vulnerability. The patch that fixes this vulnerability was released in 2013  and the kernel build timestamp of my device was released in 2014. Maybe this explain the fact that my device is not susceptible to this vulnerability. But it is just a speculation, and I would like to make sure.p  pI would like to know if the updates released at the site mentioned above are automatically installed on my device, as the patch that fixes the vulnerability mentioned above. If this updates changes the build timestamp which can be obtained by the constant Build.TIME in Android SDK. And mainly, if I can guarantee that a device is protected against a vulnerability if the kernel build timestamp is bigger than vulnerability fix patch release date.p  pIf anyone can explain me or point me a reference where I can get these information I would be really grateful.p

Positive 21990 pI have a working linux system that I want to roll a custom kernel.  As it is, everything works, Im simply branching out into trying to optimize the system as best I can.p  pMost methods I have found to explore drivers on my system appear to list all drivers loaded though  I may be wrong about that.  Is there some kind of tool that actually shows what drivers are neededp  pUsing lsmod gives me a basic idea though many of the modules shown dont seem to be used.

Negative 21990 pSo Ive done the trivial warmup apps with GAE.  Now Id like to build something with a more complex directory structure.  Something along the lines ofp  precodesiteroot models controllers controller1 controller2 ... templates template1 template2 ... codepre  p..etc.  The controllers will be Python modules handling requests.  They would then need to locate Djangostyle templates in associated folders.  Most of the demo apps Ive seen resolve template paths like thisp  precodepath  os.path.joinos.path.dirnamefile, myPage.html codepre  p...the  file  property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllerscontroller1, then the myPage.html would resolve to that same directory  controllerscontroller1myPage.html  and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.p  pThe solution Ive hacked together feels... hackyp  precodebasepaths  os.path.splitos.path.dirnamefile templatedir  os.path.joinbasepaths[0], templates codepre  pSo, Im just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.  The other nonGAE specific solutions Ive seen for resolving Python paths seem pretty heavyweight such as splitting paths into lists and manipulating accordingly.  Django seems to have an answer for this, but Id rather stick to the GAE API, vs. creating a full Django app and modifying it for GAE.p  pIm assuming anything hardcoded would be nonstarter, since the apps live on Googles infinite server farm.

Negative 21990 pI have a linux box with a bank of modems and need to create demanddial outbound PPP connections to a very large set of remote machines.  Since I have far more remotes than local modems, Id like to launch one or more instances of codepppdcode in codedemandcode mode, but not allocate a particular modem until a connection is requested.  When the connection becomes idle, Id like codepppdcode to release the modem so it can be used for a connection to a different remote.p  pIve been through the codepppd mancode pages and understand the concepts of the codecallcode and codeconnectcode options, as well as the codeoptions.DEVICEcode files and the codeetcppppeerscode directory.  Lock files will tell me which modems are in use or available.  And Im able to connect to multiple remote peers as long as I hardcode the modem assignments.  But I havent found a way to assign them dynamically, say by calling a codegetavailablemodemcode script when codepppdcode needs to dial.  Google doesnt seem to know, either.p  pA workaround might be to detect the need to demanddial with an external mechanism, and then launch codepppdcode to service it, but it seems cleaner to leverage the facility within codepppdcode itself.p  pAny pointers or ideas are appreciated.  Thanks for your thoughtsp

Negative 21990 pFor various common reasons I wanted to use tracing for my ASP.NET application.

After a while of Google, SO and MSDN I finally have a good idea of how things work. But I also found one very distrubing thing.p  pWhen using trace in ASP.NET applications it makes a lot of sense to group the trace messages together by web requests. Especially since one of the reasons I want to use it is for studying performance problems. The above mentioned tool also supports this by using codeltCorrleationgtcode tags in the generated XML files. Which in turn come from codeSystem.Diagnostics.Trace.CorrelationManagercode. It also allows other nice features like Activity startingstopping, which provides an even better grouping of trace messages. Cool, rightp  pI though so too, until I started inspecting where the codeCorrelationManagercode actually lived. After all  it was a static property. After some playing around with Reflector I found out something horrifying  its stored in codeCallContextcode Which is the kind of thing a hrefhttppiers7.blogspot.com200511threadstaticcallcontextand02.html relnofollowwe shouldnt be using in ASP.NETa, rightp  pSo... am I missing something here Is tracing really fundamentally flawed in ASP.NETp  pstrongAddedstrong Emm, Im kinda on the verge of rewriting this stuff myself.

Negative 21990 pA problem I was working on recently got me to wishing that I could lop off the front of a file. Kind of like a truncate at front, if you will. Truncating a file at the back end is a common operationsomething we do without even thinking much about it. But lopping off the front of a file Sounds ridiculous at first, but only because weve been trained to think that its impossible. But a lop operation could be useful in some situations.p  pA simple example certainly not the only or necessarily the best example is a FIFO queue. Youre adding new items to the end of the file and pulling items out of the file from the front. The file grows over time and theres a huge empty space at the front. With current file systems, there are several ways around this problemp  ul liAs each item is removed, copy the remaining items up to replace it, and truncate the file. Although it works, this solution is very expensive timewise.li liMonitor the size of the empty space at the front, and when it reaches a particular size or percentage of the entire file size, move everything up and truncate the file. This is much more efficient than the previous solution, but still costs time when items are moved in the file.li liImplement a circular queue in the file, adding new items to the hole at the front of the file as items are removed. This can be quite efficient, especially if you dont mind the possibility of things getting out of order in the queue. If you do care about order, theres the potential of having to move items around. But in general, a circular queue is pretty easy to implement and manages disk space well.li ul  pBut if there was a lop operation, removing an item from the queue would be as easy as updating the beginningoffile marker. As easy, in fact, as truncating a file. Why, then, is there no such operationp  pI understand a bit about file systems implementation, and dont see any particular reason this would be difficult.  It looks to me like all it would require is another word dword, perhaps per allocation entry to say where the file starts within the block.  With 1 terabyte drives under 100 US, it seems like a pretty small price to pay for such functionality.p  pWhat other tasks would be made easier if you could lop off the front of a file as efficiently as you can truncate at the endp  pCan you think of any technical reason this function couldnt be added to a modern file system  Other, nontechnical reasonsp

Each cluster will have two nodes.p  pOur application, or our system, as I should rather say, comes in two or three parts.p  pPart 1 An ear deployed to one cluster that contains 3rd party vendor code combined with customization code. Their code is EJB 2.0 compliant and has a lot of Remote Home interfaces.p  pPart 2 An ear deployed to the same cluster as the first ear. This ear contains EBJ 3s that make calls into the EJB 2s supplied by the vendor and the custom code. These EJB 3s are used by the JSF UI also packaged with the EAR, and some of them are also exposed as web services JAXWS 2.0 with SOAP 1.2 compliance for other clients.p  pPart 3 There may be other services that do not depend on our vendorcustom code app. These services will be EJB 3.0s and web services that are deployed to the other cluster.p  pPer a recommendation from some IBM staff on site here, communication between nodes in a cluster can be EJB RMI. But if we are going across clusters andor other cells, then the communication should be web services.p  pThat said, some of us are wondering about performance and optimizing communication for speed of our applications that will use our web services and EJBs. Right now most EJBs are exposed as remote. and our vendor set theirs up that way, rather than also exposing local home interfaces. We are wondering if WAS does any optimizations between apps in the same nodecluster node space. If two apps are installed in the same area and they call each other via remote home interface, is WAS smart enough to make it a local home interface callp  pAre their other optimization techniques Should we consider them Should we not What are the costsbenefits Here is the question from one of our team members as sent in their emailp  pThe question is Supposing we develop our EJBs as remote EJBs, where our UI controller code is talking to our EXT java services via EJB3...what are our options for performance optimization when both the EJB server and client are running in the same containerp  pAs one point of reference, google has given me some oooooold websphere performance tuning documentation from 2000 that explains a tuning configuration you can set to enable Call By Reference for EJB communication when theyre in the same application server JVM. It states the followingp  pBecause EJBs are inherently location independent, they use a remote programming model. Method parameters and return values are serialized over RMIIIOP and returned by value. This is the intrinsic RMI Call By Value model.p  pWebSphere provides the No Local Copies performance optimization for running EJBs and clients typically servlets in the same application server JVM. The No Local Copies option uses Call By Reference and does not create local proxies for called objects when both the client and the remote object are in the same process. Depending on your workload, this can result in a significant overhead savings.p  pConfigure No Local Copies by adding the following two command line parameters to the application server JVMp  precode Djavax.rmi.CORBA.UtilClasscom.ibm.CORBA.iiop.Util  Dcom.ibm.CORBA.iiop.noLocalCopiestrue codepre  pCAUTION The No Local Copies configuration option improves performance by changing Call By Value to Call By Reference for clients and EJBs in the same JVM. One side effect of this is that the Java object derived nonprimitive method parameters can actually be changed by the called enterprise bean. Consider Figure 16ap  pAlso, we will also be using Process Server 6.2 and WESB 6.2 as well in the future. Any ideas recommendationsp  pThanksp

Negative 21990 pI am trying to teach myself WCF using Learning WCF by Michele Leroux Bustamante, and so far the book is very instructive.  The application that I eventually want to develop is a web service, hosted in IIS, and so Hosting a Service in IIS, which is a section in Chapter 1, is exactly what I want.p  pBUT it seems that I need IIS installed on my development PC.p  pWhy the question arises at all is that I thought I could use the same Visual Web Developer server as Visual Studio uses for ASP.NET development instead of or until I as ready for IIS.  But I cant see anywhere in the literature, I mean how to get Visual Studio to use it for a WCF service. p  pI dont mind installing IIS, but would rather not if I dont have to.p  pIn case you cant guess already, my experience with web development does not go further than a Hello World in ASP.NET.p
Negative 21990 pI was doing some benchmarks for the performance of code on Windows mobile devices, and noticed that some algorithms were doing significantly better on some hosts, and significantly worse on others.

Negative 21990 pSilverlight 3 now contains built in browser zoom support.  The current problem I am facing is that it seems as if the Silverlight UI doesnt update rerender during multiple zoom level changes involving the CtrlMouse Wheel or Ctrl and Ctrl.  This was found when testing with the IE8 browser, on a Windows XP SP2.  p  pAt first I thought this might be a performance problem when rendering my applcation but I also managed to reproduce the same problem with only some text and a button on my page the test xaml can be found at the end of the post.  In some cases the UI stops responding mouse over visual changes.  In others the Page is responding but is not rendered for the correct zoom level.  p  pI could implement my own zoom functionality but I think it would be better in the long run to let the browser or plugin handle the zoom features Why code the same feature twice.  I am also considering disabling the autozoom support for the silverlight application.p  pAfter looking at a few other silverlight implementations I found that the majority of them that do not disable the autozoom have the same problem.  After looking into the problem a little deeper the UI would be corrected when the browser window size has changed as this forces the UI to update its render size which corrects the problem or if the Page is scrolled which also seems to send a render update to the UI.  Does anyone know of a way to solve this issue or a workaround that does not involve writing custom Zooming codep  pHere are the steps I used to produce the problem. If you would like the test project I used let me know and I can email it to you.p  pStep 1  Create a new Silverlight application using Visual Studio 2008. Step 2  Add the Xaml to the main page xaml at the end of my post. Step 3  Run the application in IE8 using the html page and the default start page. Step 4  Change the zoom level by using Ctrlmouse wheel.  You may have to move the mouse wheel very rapidly till this occurs the first time.  Usually zooming in then quickly zooming out. Note  After step 4 the UI will have some of the problems I stated above. This has been produced on 6 different machines running IE8.p  pXaml code for the MainPage filep  precodeltGrid xNameLayoutRootgt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt         ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal BackgroundLightGray Grid.Row0gt         ltTextBlock TextTesting Web Page FontSize16 FontWeightBold                                                             ForegroundGreengt     ltStackPanelgt     ltButton Grid.Row1 ContentLarge Damn Button Height34gt ltGridgt codepre

Negative 21990 pI have a website that I regularly update the code to. I keep it in version control. When I want to deploy a new version of the site, I do an export and then symlink the served directory name to the directory of the deployment. p  pThere is a place where users can upload files, and I noticed once that, after I had deployed a new version, the user files were gone Of course, I hadnt added them to the repository, and since the served site was from an export, they werent uploaded into a versioncontrolled directory anyways. p  pPHP doesnt yet have integrated svn functionality, so I couldnt do much programmatically to user uploaded files. My solution was to create an additional website, files.website.com, which sits in a parallel directory to the served website, and is served out of a directory that is under version control. That way they dont get obliterated when I do an upgrade to the website. From time to time, I manually add uploaded files to the svn project, deleted userdeleted ones, and commit the new version. Im working on a shell script to run from cron to do this, but it isnt my forte, so its on the backburner as its not a pressing need.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 21990 pSummary Were having problems with EF4 query compilation times of 12 seconds. Cached queries will only get us so far are there any ways we can actually reduce the compilation time Is there anything we might be doing wrong we can look for Thanksp  pWe have an EF4 model which is exposed over the WCF services. For each of our entity types we expose a method to fetch and return the whole entity for display  edit including a number of referenced child objects.p  pFor one particular entity we have to .Include 31 tables  subtables to return all relevant data. Unfortunately this makes the EF query compilation prohibitively slow it takes 1215 seconds to compile and builds a 7,800line, 300K query. This is the backend of a web UI which will need to be snappier than that.p  pIs there anything we can do to improve this We can CompiledQuery.Compile this  that doesnt do any work until first use and so helps the second and subsequent executions but our customer is nervous that the first usage shouldnt be slow either. Similarly if the IIS app pool hosting the web service gets recycled well lose the cached plan, although we can increase lifetimes to minimise this. Also I cant see a way to precompile this ahead of time and  or to serialise out the EF compiled query cache short of reflection tricks. The CompiledQuery object only contains a GUID reference into the cache so its the cache we really care about. Writing this out it occurs to me I can kick off something in the background from appstartup to execute all queries to get them compiled  is that safep  pHowever even if we do solve that problem, we build up our search queries dynamically with LINQtoEntities clauses based on which parameters were searching on I dont think the SQL generator does a good enough job that we can move all that logic into the SQL layer so I dont think we can precompile our search queries. This is less serious because the search data results use fewer tables and so its only 34 seconds compile not 1215 but the customer thinks that still wont really be acceptable to endusers.p  pSo we really need to reduce the query compilation time somehow. Any ideasp  ul liProfiling points to ELinqQueryState.GetExecutionPlan as the place to start and I have attempted to step into that but without the real .NET 4 source available I couldnt get very far, and the source generated by Reflector wont let me step into some functions or set breakpoints in them.  li liThe project was upgraded from .NET 3.5 so I have tried regenerating the EDMX from scratch in EF4 in case there was something wrong with it but that didnt help.   li liI have tried the EFProf utility advertised here but it doesnt look like it would help with this. My large query crashes its data collector anyway.   li liI have run the generated query through SQL performance tuning and it already has 100 index usage. I cant see anything wrong with the database that would cause the query generator problems.li liIs there something On2 in the execution plan compiler  is breaking this down into blocks of separate data loads rather than all 32 tables at once likely to help Setting EF to lazyload didnt help.   li liIve bought the prerelease OReilly Julie Lerman EF4 book but I cant find anything in there to help beyond compile your queries.   li ul  pI dont understand why its taking 1215 seconds to generate a single select across 32 tables so Im optimistic theres some scope for improvementp  pThanks for any suggestions Were running against SQL Server 2008 in case that matters and XP  7  server 2008 R2 using RTM VS2010.p

Negative 21990 pIve asked various questions related to one goal strongemhow to develop an Android app that plots bluetooth data forever in realtimeemstrong. I now have a new question from a different angle. To be fair to new readers I will cover some of the same background, but basically the question is in the title.p  pI found some open source code a hrefhttppymasde.esblueterm relnofollowBluetootha that apparently creates a background thread which updates the screen with new data it receives over a bluetooth connection. Then when I launch my Plot activity I can see the bluetooth background thread continue to write bluetooth data to Logcat. strongSo I know for a fact the bluetooth background thread is still running when I launch my Plot activity.strongp  pAgain, my goal is to plot the bluetooth data that is continually provided by the bluetooth background thread. strongI have succeeded as followsstrong since this bluetooth background thread seems to run continually and just wont die, emI decided to use its update method to call my static Plot.plotData method to plot the dataem. strongAnd this worksstrong. It will will run endlessly with out a problem  receiving bluetooth data and plotting it via periodic calls from the bluetooth background method update to my static Plot.plotData method.p  pAlthough I have received some negative feedback regarding my solution, I have found a hrefhttpgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthreadb8e42d402b6319dbpli1 relnofollowsharing data across Activitiesa where Edward Falk says sharing static data is OK. Here Edward Falk asks Are the activities all in the same application [yes]  Same task [not sure] It seems to me that you could just store the data in a static variable accessible by all of the activities. Well I tried static data and it worked, but I switched to a static method Plot.plotData which seems to work better for me.p  pThe latest feedback I have received from one person emmby that says my static Plot.plotData emgoes against the followingem strongIt sounds like youre looking for an inmemory way to share data, and thats simply not the way the Android activity model works.strong But what am I else to do I thought that an Android phone has a limited amount of RAM for running Activities one at a time, threads, handlers, Services, AnycTasks, etc. And an SD card for persisting data.p  pemmby seem to say that in order to share data from a bluetooth background thread to my Plot activity Plot.plotData that I must use the SD card. This doesnt sound right. After all I have it working using my static method Plot.plotData.p  pFrankly I dont see anything wrong with my solution primary because those who criticize it do not follow up with a definitive alternative.p  pIf you find my solution deficient please speak up and provide a definitive solution. Otherwise I will take Edward Faulks solution as the best one.p

Negative 21990 pCan someone help me out please...Im trying to start my first programming project. It will be implemented in python.p  pI need to have a textbox which i am using  wxpython for. If the user enters any text into this text box, then I want it to appear as arabic. I wanted to this by automagically changing the users Keyboard to an arabic layout when the cursor lands in the given text box.p  pSo i found this pywin32 module, which has a function LoadKeyboardLayout So i am trying to test this in IDLE, to see if I can make it accept arabic text into IDLE, to see if it works. So I enter, into IDLEp  precodewin32api.LoadKeyboardLayout00000401,1 codepre  pThis then returns, 67175425, the decimal equivalent of hex4010401 whcih I believe is the locale ID for Arabic.

No luck. Then, I thought, ok, screw it, instead of testing it quicly in IDLE, I will just try it out, in situ, in my source code for the project. WTF  it worked first time, giving exact behaviour that I wanted. Then I tried it in a different IDE, in the interpreted window, and again, IT WORKED straight awayp  pSo clearly my issue is with IDLE, in its interpreting mode.

Negative 21990 pThis is actually two questionsp  p1 What is that logic behind the fact that, when declaring a python class, do variables default to static and methods default to instance I know i can declare variables in eminit em or add staticmethod or classmethod to methods to flip them to the other side, but it just seems to me at least having them both consistently default one way or another e.g. like JavaC would make much more sense. p  pIs there some very common use case i am missing I  know the implementation is as such, but surely it must have been a design decision to have it this way, having methods default to instance but having variables default to exactly the opposite.p  p2 Is there any way to declare instance variables in python classes without putting them in eminit em p  pI know i can put them in eminit em, but that would require any subclasses which need their own eminit em to either p  pA declare them himself or p  pB manually call the base classes eminit em  themselves, p  pboth of which are a pain. I could do it, but it feels dirty subclasses something should require nothing more than the BaseClass in the class declaration to work, they should not need to call anything special in their own eminit em for the BaseClass functionality to work fullyp

Negative 21990 pI am embarking on a quest to create a mobile application that will need to communicate with a remote database. All users will access the same database and thus the same set of data. The only types of operations users will perform are selects and updates and realtime data is not important, so no persistent connection is required. Users will perform these selects and updates a few times a day.

Negative 21990 pI am trying to render some old level data using the glDrawRangeElements command. My vertices are set up correctly, my indices are set up correctly, but I cant seem to get it to render. I finally checked online and came across the example found here a hrefhttpwww.songho.caopenglglvertexarray.html relnofollowhttpwww.songho.caopenglglvertexarray.htmlap  pFrom the example, I think I have been doing it incorrectly. Apparently the start is an index value and the ending is an index value, rather than an index into the indices array. I assumed that for example if you wanted to render 10 triangles, the start would be 0 and the ending would be 29 and the count would be 30. But I am apparently wrongp  pThat would only be correct if the index value at 0, and 29 were in fact 0 and 29. So if the indices started with 400 and ended with 452, the call to that same array would instead bep  precodeglDrawRangeElementsGLTRIANGLES, 400, 452, 29, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, indices codepre  pIs that correct Does anyone else think this is a little counter intuitive Any other advice about vertex arraysp

Negative 21990 pThis is kind of a general java question and doesnt relate too much to Android.p  pIn my application I have a list of some objects of a medium complex class which implements codeComparablecode.

But simultaneously, some items may be updated by a background task, which means that the result of codecompareTocode changes. Thats where the contract may be violated.p  pI understand, that the easiest answer would be, not to update the list during the sorting at all. But its a mobile application. It has to be responsive and the user may refresh the list whenever he wants.p  pWhat would be an elegant approach to this problem Using synchronizing or some kind of lockp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 21990 pI have taken a database class this semester and we are studying about maintaining cache consistency between the RDBMS and a cache server such as memcached. The consistency issues arise when there are race conditions. For example 1. Suppose I do a getkey from the cache and their is a cache miss. Because I get a cache miss, I fetch the data from the database, and then do a putkey,value into the cache. 2. But, a race condition might happen, where some other user might delete the data I fetched from the database. This delete might happen before I do a put into the cache.p  pThus, ideally the put into the cache should not happen, since the data is longer present into the database. p  pIf the cache entry has a TTL, the entry in the cache might expire. But still, their is a window where the data in the cache is inconsistent with the database. p  pI have been searching for articlesresearch papers which speak about this kind of issues. But, I could not find any useful resources.p

What I would like to do is allow the user to receive an update while they are browsing the website that the XML file has been updated, as well as alert them to the file update if they are returning to the website after having left. p  pMy thoughts are that this would be done by using php session variables, one when they first access the website and another when the XML file is updated by a user. For the one when they access the site I thought a variable with a unique ID and timestamp as well as a timestamp of the files lastmodified value. I realize that this requires keeping storage of the session values since the value will have to be compared to something or else it will always appear as the most recent version, hence no changes. p  pNow that I think about it I guess you wouldnt need a session variable created on file update since the comparison will be based on the lastmodified value.p  pJust want to know if I am on the right track or completely offbase.p  pAny input is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 21990 pI have some utility methods that uses codeMicrosoft.Web.Administration.ServerManagercode that Ive been having some issues with.  Use the following dead simple code for illustration purposes.p  precodeusingvar mgr  new ServerManager      foreachvar site in mgr.Sites              Console.WriteLinesite.Name       codepre  pIf I put that code directly in a console application and run it, it will get and list the IIS express websites.  If I run that app from an elevated command prompt, it will list the IIS7 websites. A little inconvenient, but so far so good.p  pIf instead I put that code in a class library that is referenced and called by the console app, it will ALWAYS list the IIS Express sites, even if the console app is elevated.p  pGoogle has led me to try the following, with no luck.p  precodeThis returns IIS express var mgr  new ServerManager This returns IIS express var mgr  ServerManager.OpenRemoteEnvironment.MachineName This throws an exception var mgr  new  ServerManagerwindirsystem32inetsrvconfigapplicationhost.config codepre  pEvidently Ive misunderstood something in the way an elevated process runs.

Negative 21990 pI have a Java based web application that is hosted in google app engine. There is a simple web service call to the Amazon Product and Advertising API to look up for books when the user inputs a title. Everything runs fine on my local development environment. However, the web service call is annoyingly slow on production. p  pE.g. When I invoke the web service call in my dev environment, it takes about 34 seconds to get the response back. In production, the same call to the same API would take 1516 seconds. There is no datastore activity involved at this moment, just a web service call and display the results.p  pI am pretty sure that this is not the initial load issues others are talking about regarding GAE in production. It has been consistently slow no matter if the load is warmed up. I have tried to search everywhere but nobody seems to be complaining about the same issue. Does anyone have any clue what this might be Is there any good tool to tackle this kind of performance issue Thank youp  pHere is my update as of 01232012 I have identified the bottleneck  it takes about 10 seconds to get the port from Amazon Service I was using SOAP based web service client. My solution is to use RESTful client and the performance is greatly improved. Now it only takes 1 sec to get the information back from Amazon.p

Negative 21990 pI have a site that requires the ability for a logged in admin to push a staging database to a live database. The first thing it does is dump the sql and push to the target database. This works fine, but when I go to rsync the folders containing the uploaded material, I get an error. This ONLY occurs when the script is called from within the view, not from the command line or python shell. Here is the functionp  precodedef copymediaself, originfolder, targetfolder     commandstring  rsync a s s  originfolder, targetfolder     returncode  subprocess.callcommandstring, shellTrue     return returncode codepre  pThe return code is 12 when it errors. My best guess is that since theres a considerable delay before the script finishes executing, the view doesnt know how to properly wait for it to end. The other guess I had was that the paths somehow get screwed up from within the view.p

Negative 21990 pIm currently developing an emulator for the good old GameBoy and Im facing some problems understandig how some basic operation codes have to be implemented. p  pRight now Im implementing the AND operations the first few 0xA0  0xA3 0xA6 amp 0xA7 are pretty straight forward but the AND operations for the registers H, L are a bit different.p  pYou can download the documention of the z80 under this link a hrefhttpwww.zilog.comdocsz80um0080.pdf relnofollowum0080.pdfa page 172p  pHere are some examples to show what I mean with pseudocode and basically what I dop  pemAND A,H note the bitshiftingemp  precoderead HL register gtgt 8 save in cache C RgtC  RgtHL gtgt 8  perform AND operation with cache ANDHRgtC RgtA amp RgtC codepre  pemAND A,L note the bitmaskingemp  precoderead HL register amp0xFF save in cache C RgtC  RgtHL amp0xFF codepre  pI know all the bitoperations and I know what they do, but it seems that I cant figure out why its need to be done like that. I have some theories correct me if Im wrong p  pWhat I already understood is, that the registers H and L are basically the register HL, which is an 16Bit register. Since the CPUBus can only handle 8Bit operations, it needs to be splitted up  or the more logic suggestion since its only one register, the values of H and L are masked in the register and they simply need to be separated from each other higherlower nibble.p  pI would be deeply grateful if someone can make this more clear to me because I just want to have some more background knowledge how all this stuff works internally so its very important to me that I know what Im doing.p

Negative 21990 pI have a Rails application on a web server. Since the development is not done on the server, Ive made a small ruby shell script that I run on the server whenever I decide its time to deploy the changes and update the application on the server. Basically that script performs a checkout from SVN, codebundle installcode, coderake dbmigratecode and finally coderake assetsprecompilecode.p  pNow, the first three tasks perform their own checks to determine what they need to change and what can remain the same, but the assets precompilation task seems to recompile everything every single time, even if I didnt change anything.p  pNow, for most of the updates, I dont really need to recompile the assets, since most changes will be to the ruby scripts. However, Im pretty sure that if I remove that step from that update script, its going to strike me when I least expect it, and its going to be troublesome to figure out what the problem is.p  pSo, is there a way to do a smart asset compilation, that checks what assets needs to be compiled and compile only them Or at least to avoid compiling again when there there is no need to recompile at allp

Negative 21990 pstrongBackstorystrongp  pI wrote a specialized image inliner script that is intended to be used with both GreaseMonkey and Google Chrome.  It is supposed to download PNG files and store them in codedatacode urls in image codesrccode attributes.  This may sound ridiculous, but a certain website sets codeContentDispositioncode to codeattachmentcode for images, and I dont want the Save As dialog to pop up every time.p  pstrongThe actual questionstrongp  pThe script fetches data with an codeXMLHttpRequestcode, encodes it into base64 and stores it in a proper place.  So far, good.  But it only works when I run it through both Firebug and Chrome dev consoles, and does not when I use it as a proper userscript.  As far as I understand, this is because Greasemonkey scripts cannot use codeXMLHttpRequestcode objects directly and should rely on calls to codeGMxmlhttpRequestcode instead.  However, I cannot set coderesponseTypecode to codeblobcode or codearraybuffercode that way, and the codebinarycode parameter seems to only work for sending data through POST requests.  I only get Unicode strings.p  pJust in case, the images are served from the same domain as the page that links to them.  I believe it satisfies the same origin thingy.p  pa hrefhttpwiki.greasespot.netGMxmlhttpRequest relnofollowhttpwiki.greasespot.netGMxmlhttpRequesta here are the GMxmlhttpRequest docs.p  pIs there a way to fetch an codearraybuffercode from within a Greasemonkey userscriptp

Negative 21990 pIm getting started with Amazon Web Services and I have a few question Im not sure about. As every company webpage I want to use an officecompanyname.com email adress, but how is that done I looked up at godaddy.com for domain registration, the offer me an email adress like I want, but for 3 dollars per month.p  pIs this possible with AWS Because at AWS you have just a complex domain which is not very userfriendly or serious.p  pAlso I want to host my dynamic webpage on the amazon cloud, but Im not sure if Im doing that right. Ive read many guides, and all I know is that I have to purchase a Elastic Compute Cloud, and a Simple Storage Service... and every guide is working with the basic linux package, why not Windows Is it more expensive I just want to host a mySQL Server for the dynamic webpage, which is reached over a normal domain.p  pAnd one last question, if I sign up for an AWS account it asks me for an email account. But I found it a little bit unserious to write there my freewebmaileradress... How is it done the normal wayp  pThanks in advance Best regards, john.p

Negative 21990 pSo in a nutshell, I have server set up using tcplistener  tcpclient, and it has a couple dozen client machines. Everything is working well, except that I do not yet have a system set up to detect whether or not a client has disconnected. I would like to use heartbeats periodically sent packets to show the client is still there. Unfortunately, what is happening is that the server has a waiting receive block called so that it can get actual data from the clients, but it is receiving the heartbeats instead. Is there any way I can set up another receive on the same port that is looking specifically for heartbeats Thanks.p

Negative 21990 pI am currently going through the book Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design and also getting used to some of the features of C11 especially uniqueptr and move semantics at the same time. In the book, they give the design of a strategy board game as an example. It has a board, tiles and units on tiles. The code is in Java and I was trying to rewrite it in C. In Java, the tile class is as followsp  precodepublic class Tile      private List units      public Tile              units  new LinkedList           protected void addUnitUnit unit              units.addunit           protected List getUnits              return units       codepre  pI did the same thing in c first using sharedptr. It worked but very slow compared to my second version which used raw pointers. I then tried uniqueptrp  precodeclass Tile   public   Tile   virtual Tile    void addUnit        mUnits.pushbackstduniqueptrltUnitgtnew Unit       stdvectorltstduniqueptrltUnitgtgt getUnits        return mUnits     private   stdvectorltstduniqueptrltUnitgtgt mUnits   codepre  pthe compiler does not like the getUnits. From what I understand it comes from the fact that the copy constructor is disabled in the uniqueptr. How would you return the list of vectors Thanksp

Negative 21990 pI have come across a typical problem and it seems strange to me. Details are something like this  On the activity in my app, there are edittexts and submit button. After filling the data in the edittexts, user can click submit button. After clicking submit button, based on the values that are entered by the user, either of the two alert dialogs are shown. One is success and the other one is failed.p  pThe thing is when the user enters invalid data and clicks submit button, the failed alert dialog gets opened. I have a buttonOK on the failed alert dialog, after clicking it I wrote strongcodedialog.dismisscodestrong to make it disappear, so that user can recheck the data and can modify. But the problem is while rechecking amp modifying the data if he changes the orientation, then again the failed alert dialog is popping up even without clicking submit button. Please suggest.p  pstrongExtra Detailsthough probably not necessary for this problemstrong While changing orientation the  activity is recreated. So, I am saving the current data in the onSavedInstanceState and retrieving it in onCreate method to set back the values in the edittexts. Everything works fine, but once clicking on submit button, the respective alert dialog appears. Then after changing orientation the dialog is again popping up.

Negative 21990 pstrongThe Backgroundstrongp  pToday I was reflecting on the pain installOS testing.

Using the codereturncode command anywhere basically seems to quit the script. p  pOne thing Im not clear on is whetherhow codedisowncode, codenohupcode, etc. are applicable to a command process vs. a script process, i.e., will any of them work properly on only a command inside a script and if not, how to initialize a script as a background process that still asks for input.p  pMaybe I should use some alternative to codesleepcodep

Negative 21990 pBasically my problem is that I have a large table of about 17,000,000 products that I need to apply a bunch of updates to really quickly. p  pThe table has 30 columns with the id set as int10 AUTOINCREMENT.p  pI have another table which all of the updates for this table are stored in, these updates have to be precalculated as they take a couple of days to calculate. This table is in the format of [ productid int10, updatevalue int10 ].p  pThe strategy Im taking to issue these 17 million updates quickly is to load all of these updates into memory in a ruby script and group them in a hash of arrays so that each updatevalue is a key and each array is a list of sorted productids.p  precode     150 gt [1,2,3,4,5,6],    160 gt [7,8,9,10]  codepre  pUpdates are then issued in the format ofp  precodeUPDATE product SET updatevalue  150 WHERE productid IN 1,2,3,4,5,6 UPDATE product SET updatevalue  160 WHERE productid IN 7,8,9,10 codepre  pIm pretty sure Im doing this correctly in the sense that issuing the updates on sorted batches of productids should be the optimal way to do it with mysql  innodb.p  pIm hitting a weird issue though where when I was testing with updating 13 million records, this only took around 45 minutes. Now Im testing with more data, 17 million records and the updates are taking closer to 120 minutes. I would have expected some sort of speed decrease here but not to the degree that Im seeing.p  pAny advice on how I can speed this up or what could be slowing me down with this larger record set p  pAs far as server specs go theyre pretty good, heaps of memory  cpu, the whole DB should fit into memory with plenty of room to grow.p

Negative 21990 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pI need to create an iterator over a filesystem subtree e.g. an iterator that would, given a folder, return all files contained inside, in a depthfirstsearch order, one at every codenextcode method call.p  pThe contents of the subtree can change over time, e.g. it is possible and probable that, while the iteration is still in progress, new subfolders and files will get created and some of the existing ones will get deleted.p  pFortunatelly the following conditions are acceptablep  ul lipthe implementation can but it would be better if it did not skip newly created files e.g. files that originated after the iteration started and folders and files in those folders, or even just some of them,pli lipthe implementation can but it would be better if it did not list deleted files e.g. files that no longer exist but were present when the iteration started, or even just some of them.pli ul  hr  pstrongMotivationstrongp  pIn order to give you a better insight into the rationals behind those decisions, Id like to briefly describe the application as a whole.p  pIt is a producerconsumer like application. A web service the producer would accept files and store them on a local filesystem, somewhere in the subtree hierarchy.p  pAnother application the consumer would process these files. It would be invoked periodically via CRON every few minutes. When launched, it would crawl the subtree, find all documents, and hand them over to be processed to yet another application, if thats relevant. After a document is processed, it gets deleted from the local filesystem.p  pThe problem is that the producer and the consumer would be running at the same time. Moreover, multiple instances of the consumer application might be running at the same time as well. E.g. while a consumer is crawling the subtree, new documents might get created and existing documents might get deleted. Even the structure of subdirectories might get modified.p  pBecause the crawler gets launched periodically every few minutes, it does not matter if it consumes all the documents available at the time especially those produced while the consumer is running. It is only important that a produced document gets eventually consumed with a reasonably small delay. Thats where the relaxing conditions listed above come from.p  hr  pstrongPossible solutionsstrongp  pI first thought I would create a snapshot of the subtree into memory at launch time e.g. the list of documents to be processed and then iterate over them. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13877288iteratoroverasnapshotofafilesystemsubtree1387797413877974my other posta. But the hierarchy might be very large even tens of thousands of documents processed per a few hours and I was thinking that this approach might have unacceptable performace demands memory amp speed.p  hr  pstrongHow would you implement such an iteratorstrongp  hr  pThanks very much for your help and sorry for the big length of the post.p

Negative 21990 pIs it possible to get a permanent access token using OAuth2  I want to use Box to download files during an installation.  The installation grabs all of the files in a particular folder.  I have a box account set up as the owner of the folder and in API v1 I can get a permanent authtoken to reuse in my executable.  But it appears that with OAuth2 I can only get a 1 hour access token and a refresh token.  But because the end user does not actually have access to Box, and the application is a desktop application, they cant authenticate on the fly if a token has expired.  I know there are other solutions out there, but the V1 api let me do this and I was hoping to not lose this functionality when V1 is deprecated.p

Negative 21990 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14494769clickanddragimagetoimagegridClick and drag image to image grida  p blockquote    pI have a few image boxes in my form and I was wondering how can I would place a grid across the form that have a bunch of lines so the whole grid is a bunch of 64 x 64 squares. I need it so I can select an image and place it onto a specific square using the mouse and be able to go through the whole grid and check for example how many of one specific image is on the grid. To give you a better idea of what Im doing is that I have a few image boxs which contain different 64 x 64 images. There is another image box that shows the image I clicked on last, which is like a brush because whenever you left click a box in the grid it pastes it into that specific box in the grid. I also need it so I can right click the box and delete the image in the box the mouse is over. Finally I need to be able to read all the images in the box and output it into a file that I can later open. Im using it to create land in a game, which the program will output the needed texture and and where ground level is for the boxs which make up the whole terrain. What I need to know is what kind of thing should I do to be able to do this Ive been trying the past few hours on how I make the boxs and how to know where the mouse is and stuff and Im completely stuck. A simple idea would be helpful. I actually dont know what controls I should use for this so an idea that doesnt involve any grid controls is still very helpful.p

Negative 21990 pId like to know how mulitple conditions are handled in CC. I have some code which works fine, but Im concerned there is an elemtent of luck involved and I dont want to get caught out. Considerp  precodeif  condition1  condition containing invalid reference        do something  codepre  pSo long as condition 1 is TRUE, the second condition does not appear to generate an error even though the condition by itself would produce a fault. For examplep  precodeint main      char    string1[]  StackOverflow     char    string2  0       1 This will work because string1 is valid     if strlenstring1  0         printfs, string1       2 This will cause an error     if strlenstring2  0         printfs, string2       3 But this ifOR works fine     if strlenstring1  0strlenstring2  0         printfno problem       4 And of course this doesnt     if strlenstring2  0strlenstring1  0         printfI dont believe it      return 0  codepre  pIt can be seen with an list of OR conditions, the if question halts at the first TRUE statement, read left to right, no matter what follows. However, changing number 3 top  precodeif strlenstring1  0 ampamp strlenstring2  0 codepre  pwill still fail despite the first condition being false, thus rendering the whole thing as false  i.e. the question doesnt halt like the OR example.p  pTo generalise, I have observed the followingp  precodeif  TRUE or INVALID    gt no problem  if  FALSE or INVALID   gt error  if  TRUE and INVALID   gt error  if  FALSE and INVALID  gt error     see the EDIT codepre  pAre these results going to be universal in all cases, or is it compilerplatform dependentp  pCan I get away with writing code following the above rules, or should I NEVER get into the situation where one of the conditions is invalidp  pIm going through some old code for my boss and its littered with examples like 3 above. It will take quite some time to catch them all and adapt the code to avoid any invalid conditions. While 3 and 4 could be easily adjusted to sit inside an codeifstring2  0   code block, its not so easy in practice for the code I have.p  pEDITp  pSince checking again, the codeif  FALSE and INVALID code does indeed run without error. I dont know why it was failing before I might not even have posed the question had it worked initially. Ill put it down to witchcraft and poor concentration.p  pUltimately, while the answer has been hinted at but not confirmed verbatim, it seems this reliance on ShortCircuit Evaluation thanks for the wiki link is a legitimate technique. Im glad I dont have to rewrite any codep

The interesting is The listeners do work too if I pass the fetched collection. I trigger them by calling codethis.collection.fetchcode in codeinitializecode again. Then the rerendering works. It must be something around the collection pass from the layout.p
Negative 21990 pSimply put, what I am doing is effectively making a Shape package with some valuable framework features for some other framework implementor.

Second is to use nosql graph model DB but it is also not compatible with the algorithms we use since we continuously pull al the data into a matrix. Final approach we think is to use normal files to keep the data but it is harder to keep track and watch the changes since no query method or the editor.

It turned out that the identical strings the example was 1A04 and 1A04 were no longer being considered equal using the  operator.p  pHaving looked at the following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions390900cantoperatorbeappliedtogenerictypesincCan39t operator  be applied to generic types in Ca it seems likely that the strings were being compared on reference equality instead of in the normal manner.p  pIs there a safe way to do this in c or should using  in a generic method be considered dangerous for the above reasonp  pJust to confirm that this was the problem my fix consisted of inlining the offending methods in the string case resulting inp  precode    private bool DetailsMatchstring x, AnotherType y, AFurtherType z              return x  null  x  x ampamp                NullOrChecky, y ampamp                NullOrCheckz, z.IsSameAs      codepre  pHey presto  everything works and the tests pass againp

Finally I want codes1code, codes2code and codes3code averaged over their frequency of occurrences.p  pIt may be very trivial question, but, as a beginner I searched amp tried a lot in this web, but cud not advance much.

So i want to have a new List of wafers in each lot but the references to the wafers should be the same as in the original lot because i want to change values to the wafers and it should change the values in the orginal wafer and copied wafer.

Is there a way to bypass this error, as Im not going to be inserting into that table  just using it for selects.p  pWhats nice is that it is already a reference property because of FKs. If I were to change it to a custom view, then Id have to redo all 12 of these manually to the view and their linking to this table which isnt the end of the world, yet trying to avoid it p

Negative 21990 pI have a oneonone connection between a server and a client. The server is streaming realtime audiovideo data. p  pMy question may sound weird, but should I use multiple portssocket or only one Is it faster to use multiple ports or a single one offer better performance Should I have a port only for messages, one for video and one for audio or is it more simple to package the whole thing in a single portp  pOne of my current problem is that I need to first send the size of the current frame as the size  in bytes  may change from one frame to the next. Im fairly new to Networking, but I havent found any mechanism that would automatically detect the correct range for a specific object being transmitted. For example, if I send a 2934 bytes long packet, do I really need to tell the receiver the size of that packet p  pI first tried to package the frame as fast as they were coming in, but I found out the receiving end would sometime not get the appropriated number of bytes. Most of the time, it would read faster than I send them, getting only a partial frame. Whats the best way to get only the appropriated number of bytes as quickly as possiblep  pOr am I looking too low and theres a higherlevel classframework used to handle object transmissionp

Negative 21990 pIm using an Atmel SAM3S MCU, and their ASF stuff can do I2C they call it TWI communications.   Thats fine, except its taking too much time from my main loop.p  pSo, Id like to be able to spark off a DMA transfer to read the data from the I2C device.  However, all the docs say you cant turn on TX and RX simultaneously on a halfduplex device like TWI.  The docs do show that it has a Peripheral DMA Controller PDC register section in the TWI registers, but I cant find any PDC examples, except for the USART, which is full duplex.p  pThe only thing I can think of to try is to set TX section, and the nextRX section, and hope that it automatically enables RX after the TX is done.p  pHas anyone out there used DMA for an I2C read on the SAM3S  If so, could you point me to some docs or examplesp

Negative 21990 pjust want to know what is missing or wrong with my code here. I read about the AudioRecord and wanted to apply it so that I can use the NoiseSuppression API for this.

Negative 21990 pI noticed that when Boolean data is sent from javascript to Django view, it is passed as truefalse lowercase instead of TrueFalseuppercase.

Negative 21990 pI want to create an example of a table with dynamic data that also indicates when a table value has changed.p  pSo imagine a table of data. One cell on one row changes its value and it turns green to show that it has changed. p  pIm new to Angular. Ive been through the tutorial but Im struggling to figure out the right kind of approach to this. Im not asking for a step by step tutorial, but if an Angular veteran could give me a broadstrokes approach as to which parts of Angular I need to be focusing on, and a few tips on how best to structure the app, it would be a big help. p  pRight now I have an array of JSON objects attached to codescope.rowscode and a table with the rows created using codengrepeatcode. Theres a button that changes some values in the rows data at random. That seems to be doing the trick of updating the rows as I expected, but I havent figured out how to bridge that gap between databinding and dom manipulation. And its possible that my approach is all wrong.p

Negative 21990 pI am developing a game where every thing in the game world is represented by an global unique identifier.p  pThose ids each measure 64 bits and are generated by hashing together the time of creation, the machines network address and a random number.

Negative 21990 pWith codeUIDynamicscode it is simple to have the physics objects, called dynamic items, control custom views or indeed anything you want using the protocol codeUIDynamitItemcode with the three properties center, transform and bounds. I would like to do something similar with codeSpriteKitcode, but according to the manual p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationSpriteKitReferenceSKNodeRefReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccclSKNode relnofollow titleApple docsUnlike views, you cannot create SKNode subclasses that perform custom drawingap  pSpecifically, I would like to have the physics bodies control some vector graphics I currently have in a drawrect. There are two things I am after here p  ol liThe first is to let the vector graphics move around like any other node.li liThe second is to let position, angle and other properties change the exact position of some of the control points.li ol  pI am fairly certain that I could achieve this with codeUIDynamicscode and dynamic items, but then I wouldnt be able to use actions and other nice sprite kit features.p  pIt would also seem that 1 could be handled by converting the paths to codecgpathscode and using shape nodes, but that would be limiting, and not cover 2.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 21990 pI am making an android app. In the action bar, I have three buttons the up button, a button that goes to a home page essentially a restart, and an info button that describes the app.p  pI have set the info button to go to an activity  called info activity that just has some text on it. The issue is this problem My info activity can be triggered by multiple activities in the app, so this activity does strongnotstrong have one parent I can name in the Android manifest for a return. I cannot find any documentation to allow one activity to return to multiple activities, depending on which the activity the info activity was accessed from and use the up button navigation to return to it. Is this impossible Or is there another way I can do what I am attempting It seems like one activity can only have one parent.p
Negative 21990 pIm working on the motion for my paddles in my PONG clone and the program doesnt want to register SDLKEYUPDOWN sometimes. I think I have an idea of why this is but now how to fix it. So the way my game is looped currently I am using a state machine in my main function that uses a codeGamecode class state which manages two paddles and a ball all of which are three different class instances.

I think this is because there is only a 13 chance that the program polls when a key is released or pressed, sometimes resulting in no change in the position. Basically, if PLAYERONE hits a key while codeGamecode is running codePlayerTwo.eventscode it wont register the key pressrelease.

As I want to write for mobile as well I cannot use AnsiString, which was a good way to ensure that the string was a onebyte string. That simplified things. I tested the following codep  precodeTByte  array of Byte  function TForm3.convertSB arg string TByte var    i Int32 begin    Label1.Text  SizeOf Char    for i  Low arg to High arg do    begin       label1.Text  label1.Text     IntToStr Ord arg [i]    end end  convert SB   convertSB MThd codepre  pIt returns 2 77 84 104 100 as label text in Windows as well as Android. Does this mean that Delphi treats strings by default as UTF8 This would greatly simplify things but I couldnt find it in the help. And what is the best way to convert this to an array of bytes Read each character and test whether it is 1, 2 or 4 bytes and allocate this space in the array For converting back to a character just read the array of bytes until a byte is encountered lt 128p

Negative 21990 pstrongEDIT  besides the answer by Gordon, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions606234selectcountfrommultipletablesI found this question answered beautifully on this threadastrongp  pWhile we can execute a group of insertupdate statements as a batch, there is no such provision for select statements. I understand that its impossible to do so because they return results that may have many columns.p  pHowever, codeSELECT COUNT FROM tablenamecode returns just one value and that is an integer. Is there a way to run a group of such queries as a batch and retrieve the results as an int arrayp  pMy particular requirement is to run these queries for a bunch of tables on the same database and then repeat this for more databases. Consider this examplep  precode    String[] queries  SELECT COUNT FROM table1,                         SELECT COUNT FROM table2,                         SELECT COUNT FROM table3      Statement st  connection.createStatement     forString q queries                        st.addBatchq                 st.executeBatch codepre  pIn this case, the executeBatch command will only return the number of rows affected, which will be zero I suppose in this case for each statement.p  pIs there a way to make a batch of such statements considering that they return only one value each Any workaroundp  pstrongSpecific requirements follow..strongp  pSQL Procedures are out of question as I have to do this on many different databases and I dont have any access except to read them. I mean, I emcanem store procedures there, but Ive been told not to modify the database in any way and just to read from it. Additionally, the number of databases may increase later and I wouldnt be there to install these procedures on them, so I dont want that dependency in order for this solution to be truly flexible.p  pI am using Java with SQL Server 2008 for building a webpage that gets count values from a bunch of tables on various databases and displays them.p

In that callback function, I call codeTransmitcode again, but now it returns with an error defined by the DLL Port not ready CreateFile.p  pHere is the simplified pseudocodep  precodeinclude Device.h             contains OpenCom amp Transmit  const short comPort  3  COM port number global  int mainint argc, char argv[]       OpenComcomPort           Open the port     Transmitcommand          where command represents some command      newThreadFunctaskHandle  Creates new callback thread and calls callbackFunc     getchar                  wait while other thread runs     return 0   signed long cdecl callbackFunc params      Transmitcommand          error Port not ready CreateFile     OpenComcomPort           error Port already open CreateFile  codepre  pIf I call codeOpenComcode in the callback thread, I get this error Port already open CreateFile. So the callback thread can see that the port is open but cannot communicate on it. I know I should manage the port communications somehow with a mutex or similar, but whats the reason why the callback thread cant communicate on the port And how can I allow the callback thread to communicate on the port I opened in the main threadp

Negative 21990 pstrongEDIT Feb 24strong See bottom of the post for extra information, examples, and code.p  pThere has been some downtime at work lately, so I decided to pick up some Bash scripting and automate the process of building our products. Heres a simplified version of our setup  p  ul liThere are three types of code bases  base libraries, old interfaces, and new interfacesli liBuilding is done in two steps  1 setting the environmental variables and 2 compiling an executable  package both of those are done with scripts, strongsome of which take command line arguments, and some dontstrong.li liEach code base uses a different codesetenvcode and codebuildcode scripts so the scripts directory could have things like codelibssetenv.shcode, codeoldifsetenv.shcode, codenewifsetenv.shcode, codelibsbuild.shcode, etc...li ul  pSo. What I wanted to do is create some combination of Bash functions and scripts that wouldp  ul liDetect which code bases directory I am currently inli liParse through any number of command line options  arguments. Ive been using codegetoptscode in my attempts. ul liSome options are just flags e.g. codevcode for verbose output and some require a value e.g. codeversion 3.0codeli ulli liRun the appropriate codesetenvcode scriptli liRun the appropriate codebuildcode scriptli ul  pFirst I tried putting all this in a single code.shcode file. I ran into a problem where some of the build scripts would try to read my own command line arguments as if they were meant for them. So Id run something like codemyscript.sh vcode and would get an error like  p  precodescriptsbuildbaselibs.sh line X cd v invalid option   cd usage cd [LP] [dir]   codepre  pbecause codebuildbaselibs.shcode checks if the argument passed to it as either codedebugcode or codereleasecode and if its not if it is, for example, codevcode, it treats it as a filepath and passes it to a codecdcode call. Which is fine for the original script, but it messes up my wrapper. So strongquestion 1strong can I still put everything in a single .sh file, but somehow avoid this issue call the appropriate codebuildcode scripts with only a subset or none of the original command line arguments, maybe  p  pWhen this didnt work, I tried splitting the functionality  so I would have mysetenv.sh and mybuild.sh, and have the former parse through my own command line arguments, and then call the latter with any or none of the original options so if I run codemysetenv.sh g version 3.0code, I could choose whether to then call codemybuild.shcode with codegcode, with codeversion 3.0code, with both, or with neither. Except I apparently dont know enough about Bash to make this run  when I run codemysetenv.shcode I dont actually see any of the output I am supposed to see from codemybuild.shcode. I emsuspectem it has to do with child processes and subshells, but I just dont know... I also tried creating a small bash function in code.bashrccode and then have that function call the other two scripts, but ran into the same problem.p  pSo... advise me, pleasep  h2 EDIT Feb 24 h2  pFor simplicitys sake, Ive reduced the number of possible situations. Lets assume I am going to be running my script with the following options and argumentsbr codemyscript.sh c v ver.3.0 debugcodebr where codeccode just sets some flag, codevcode makes it so I need to append ver.3.0 to the end of the build command, and codedebugcode is an argument handled by the codebuildcode scripts, its not one of my own so Ill need to pass it along, if its provided.p  pGenerally, my script should do the followingp  h31 Parse through my custom optionsh3  pNothing fancy about those. I reset the OPTIND variable to make sure I always read everything p  precodeOPTIND1 while getopts cv OPTION do     c echo Option c      v echo Option v   OPTARG       echo Unknown option. done codepre  h32 Choose the codesetenvcode command and run ith3  pBoth codesetenvcode and codebuildcode scripts are designed to handle command line arguments, but I myself never pass any to the codesetenvcodes  only to codebuildcodes, and even then only if the argument is the value of the codevcode option. So my codesetenvcode script is codedevelopmentscriptssetenvscript.shcode, I would want to run  p  pcode. developmentscriptssetenvscript.sh  no options, ignoring that debug from beforecode  p  pFirst, without ignoring the codedebugcode because even without the codeOPTINDcode part, I get exactly the same errorp  precodeSETENVCOMMAND. developmentscriptssetenvscript.sh  Which will then call setenvscript2.sh, which will call setenvscript3.sh echo eval SETENVCOMMAND OPTIND eval SETENVCOMMAND OPTIND  I believe this should call the SETENVCOMMAND with anything after the OPTIND index... codepre  pI get the following error  p  precodeeval . developmentscriptssetenvscript.sh developmentscriptssetenvscript2.sh line 104 cd ver.3.0 No such file or directory codepre  pRelevant sections of codesetenvscript2.shcode include  p  precode60 for option in  do 61     case option in 62         release ...  63         debug ...  64         help ...  65          srcpathoption  66     esac 67 done ... 103 if [ n srcpath ] then 104     srcdircd P srcpath pwd P 105 else 106     srcdirpwd P codepre  pSo, as far as I can tell, codesetenvscript.shcode is being called with no arguments as shown by the codeechocode though I expected to get that codedebugcode..., which is what I want, but one of the scripts called by emitem still treats ver.3.0 as an argument  which I dont want it to.

Ive tried various ideas like putting the codeevalcode in a function, or inside codeComponent.onCompletedcode, etc, but I cant seem to figure out how to get anything created by the codeevalcode to be recognized as part of the parent QML element.p  pFor example I want to be able to call codetestitem.testfunctioncode  but it is not defined outside the scope of this handler.p

Negative 21990 pIm making a game using canvas, and am running into strange Chrome behavior that I cant pin down. Sometimes when I load the game, the Chrome Task Manager will report that its allocating 300MB a second, ramping up to over a few GB of memory in just a matter of 10 seconds or so, and it doesnt stop until the tab crashes.p  pWhen I try to run the javascript profiler, the problem stops. When I load the tab with the profiler running, it is perfectly stable. When the problem happens, and then I start the profiler, it will go from 1.5GB to a stable 40MB immediately. And the heap snapshot shows me what I would expect if the game was running stably.p  pMy game is running on codewindow.setIntervalcode Ive tried coderequestAnimationFramecode and recursive codesetTimeoutcode and the problem still happens, and it happens more often with this is set high, meaning that when I set the game to 30FPS, this rarely ever happens, and when I set it to 60FPS, it happens over half the time. This is only happening on Chrome, Firefox seems fine.p  pstrongHow do I debug this, when Chrome seems to do garbage collection only when the profiler is runningstrongp  pAlso, Ive noticed that some of my animations and keyboard inputs are a little funny when I push the FPS to 60. I assume that this could be related, but this is also the case in Firefox.p
Negative 21990 pIm trying to get the underlying socketstream or the IP address from a NSURLConnection as the request starts transmitting a response. I havent been able to find a way to get the underlying lower level stream from an active request which would then easily allow me to get the IP information.p  pThe use case for this is to record the exact IP used to a debug log since the hostname in the URL request can return many different IPs from the load balancer.p  pI recognize that these are higher level APIs than plain sockets and Im considering doing a parallel DNS resolve for the same hostname as a workaround, but that still doesnt gurantee that the DNS resolution will return the same IP that was used for the request in question.p  pThanks in advance for the helpp

Negative 21990 pJust wondering if there are tricksways in which I could cache the plots being generated through our shiny app. p  pemBackgroundemp  pWe are doing somewhat compute intensive computations which finally result in  a plot. I am already cachingusing memoise the computations done, globally in shiny but it still takes about .75 seconds to render a plot. I was just wondering if we can decrease that time by removing the time it takes to render an image and if there are slick ways of already doing it.p  pemMore detailsemp  pI am using grid to create the plotheatmap in this case. Ideally would like the caching to be disk based as storing plots in memory wont scale up. p  pThanks Abhip

Negative 21990 pI have an array of people. I want to get the counts of the entire list grouped by each Level and Gender combination.

Negative 21990 pI have an ExpandableListView which Ive been using for a while in some of my apps now. Recently however, I had to set the layout param of it as followsp  precodeandroidlayoutwidthmatchparent  androidlayoutheightwrapcontent  codepre  psince in this particular instance of the listview i have very few children. When I load the app at first, everything is working properly, and the height of the listview is exactly as much as its children.p  pThen I added an EditText box above my list. Naturally, the keyboard appears and pushes up the listview. Lets say it has 8 children total. When the keyboard has been pressed 2 of them become invisible and the getChildCount method returns 6, and a scrollbar appears, allowing me to view the 2 invisible ones.p  pThe problem is, that when i get the keyboard out of the screen, the listview retains its scrollbar and getChildCount keeps returning 6, even though it now has enough space to stretch its layout to the way it wass on app start... I rely very heavily on getChildCount to perform some calculations in onMeasure and this behaviour is totally bugging everything. Any insight as to why this is happening and how i could fix itp

The assembly exists in a WP8 app, but not for a Universal App Class Library. This means that even if I add the WINDOWSPHONEAPP macro to the library, the app will not compile. You cannot use the NavigationHelper generated by Windows Phone 88.1 projects inside a Universal App Class Library. I will try to raise this issue. Thanksp

Negative 21990 pNeed to know the difference between all of these patterns, and what are their origins.p  pAll these patterns encapsulate requests into command objects.p  pIn command objects that you see in hexagonalDDD architectures, the command is just a POJO that the command handler takes as argument in the handle method. p  pQuestions  what are the main benefits to not use smart command  with a execute method  and go with simple message command instead when the logic is inside the handler p  pThank you, I hope the question is not weirdp  pstrongeditstrongp  pa hrefhttpswww.cuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid91 relnofollowhttpswww.cuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid91a p  pThe author talks about the reasons he uses this patternp  blockquote   pIn the early days my implementation of the Command Pattern design consisted of classes that contained both properties to hold the data and an Execute method that would start the operation. The design had an abstract Command base class that contained all of logic for handling transactions, reexecuting commands after a deadlock occurred, measuring performance, security checks, etc. This base class was a big code smell and was a form of God Object with many responsibilities. Furthermore, having data and behavior interleaved made it very difficult to mockabstract that logic during unit testing.p blockquote  pThe same question has been asked in the comments, he answered  p  blockquote   pI dont consider this the Command Pattern, although the patterns are clearly related, since they both deal with commands. But they are also very different, since the command pattern deals with a single ICommand interface that consumers can depend on. This allows them to know nothing about the commands they execute and it allows consumers to store, execute, and undo a list of unrelated commands. Take for instance a text processor or painting application where changes are made in lots of small steps and each step must be undoable. In such application it is pretty clear you need the command pattern. For Line of Business applications however, we often deal with transactions and need to add a lot of crosscutting concerns around those transactions. This is a clear case for the pattern as I describe in in this blog post.p blockquote

Negative 21990 pWe are loading data from a source that contains rates with date ranges. The rate seldom changes. E.g.p  precodeProductId, SupplierId, CategoryId, Rate, ValidFrom, ValidTo 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 20140101, 20140630 codepre  pThis rate is valid for six months. The reporting requirement is to display average rates for flexible time ranges over products, suppliers, categories...p  pTherefore I joined the rates with the time dimension, resulting in a fact table like thisp  precodeProductId, SupplierId, CategoryId, Rate, Date 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 20140101 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 20140102 ... approx. 180 rows for this one rate codepre  pso there will be one rate per day. Since the rates are sometimes valid for a year or two, I am producing a large fact table with about 200 million rows and growing.p  pThe cube loads in a couple of minutes and aggregates the data down to about 1.5 GB while the datamart occupies about 20 GB. The cube query performance seems OK.p  pI could of course change the granularity, for example aggregate to a month. But the rates are daily rates, they do not change often but not necessarily on the first day of a month.p  pI just wanted to get opinions on the row proliferation the ETL process produces. Does it have a smell, are there better ways to get done what we needp

Negative 21990 pI am working on sparse reconstruction using a calibrated stereo pair. This is the approach I have taken step by stepp  p1 I Calibrated my stereo cameras using the Stereo Camera Calibrator app in MATLAB.p  p2 I Took a pair of stereo images and Undistorted each image.p  p3 I Detect, extract, and match point features.p  p4 I Use the triangulate function in MATLAB to get 3D coordinates of the matched points by passing the stereoParametes object into triangulate. The resulting 3D coordinates are with respect to the optical center of camera 1 Right camera and it is in millimeters.p  pThe problem is that the point clouds seems to be warped and curved towards the edges of the image. at first it seemed like a barrel distortion of the lenses to me. so I recalibrated the bumblebee XB3 cameras using MATLAB camera calibrator app. but this time I used 3 radial distortion coefficients and also included tangential and skew parameters. but the results are the same. I also tried Caltechs camera calibration toolbox but it had the same results as MATLAB. the radial distortion coefficients are similar in both toolboxes. also another problem is that the Z values in the point cloud are all negative but I am thinking that might be coming from the fact that I am using right camera as camera 1 and left camera as camera 2 as opposed to what MATLABs coordinate system is in the link attached.p  pI have attached couple of pictures of 3D point cloud from both sparse and dense 3D reconstruction. I am not interetsed in Dense 3D but just wanted to do it to see if the problem still exist which it does. I believe that means the main problem is with the images and camera calibration rather than algorithms.p  pNow my questions arep  p1 What is the main reasonreasons for having warpedcurved 3D point clouds is it camera calibration only or other steps may introduce error as well how can I check on thatp  p2 Can you suggest another camera calibration toolbox besides MATLABs and Caltechs maybe one that is more suitable for radial distortionsp  pThanksp  pImagesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC0qmN.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7pvHU.jpg altenter image description herep  pLinksp  pa hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpvisiongscoordinatesystems.html relnofollowcoordinate systemap  pCodep  precodeclear close all clc  loadmystereoparams.mat I11  imreadRight.tif I22  imreadLeft.tif figure, imshowpairI11, I22, montage titlePair of Original Images  [I1, newOrigin1]  undistortImageI11,stereoParams.CameraParameters1 [I2, newOrigin2]  undistortImageI22,stereoParams.CameraParameters2 figure, imshowpairI1, I2, montage titleUndistorted Images   Detect feature points imagePoints1  detectSURFFeaturesrgb2grayI1, MetricThreshold, 600 imagePoints2  detectSURFFeaturesrgb2grayI2, MetricThreshold, 600   Extract feature descriptors features1  extractFeaturesrgb2grayI1, imagePoints1 features2  extractFeaturesrgb2grayI2, imagePoints2   Visualize several extracted SURF features figure imshowI1 title1500 Strongest Feature Points from Image1 hold on plotselectStrongestimagePoints1, 1500  indexPairs  matchFeaturesfeatures1, features2, MaxRatio, 0.4 matchedPoints1  imagePoints1indexPairs, 1 matchedPoints2  imagePoints2indexPairs, 2   Visualize correspondences figure showMatchedFeaturesI1, I2, matchedPoints1, matchedPoints2,montage titleOriginal Matched Features from Globe01 and Globe02   Transform matched points to the original images coordinates matchedPoints1.Location  bsxfunplus, matchedPoints1.Location, newOrigin1 matchedPoints2.Location  bsxfunplus, matchedPoints2.Location, newOrigin2  [Cloud, reprojErrors]  triangulatematchedPoints1, matchedPoints2, stereoParams figureplot3Cloud,1,Cloud,2,Cloud,3,b.titlePoint Cloud before noisy match removal xlabelX, ylabelY, zlabelDepth Z in mm   Eliminate noisy points meanmeanmeansqrtsumreprojErrors . 2, 2 standdevstdsqrtsumreprojErrors . 2, 2 errorDists  maxsqrtsumreprojErrors.2,2,[],14  validIdx  errorDists lt meanmeanstanddev tt1findCloud,3gt0 validIdxtt10 tt2findabsCloud,3gt1800 validIdxtt20 tt3findabsCloud,3lt1000 validIdxtt30  points3D  CloudvalidIdx,   figureplot3points3D,1,points3D,2,points3D,3,b.titlePoint Cloud after noisy match removal xlabelX, ylabelY, zlabelDepth Z in mm  validPoints1  matchedPoints1validIdx,  validPoints2  matchedPoints2validIdx,   figure showMatchedFeaturesI1, I2, validPoints1,validPoints2,montage titleMatched Features After Removing Noisy Matches   get the color of each reconstructed point validPoints1  roundvalidPoints1.Location numPixels  sizeI1, 1  sizeI1, 2 allColors  reshapeim2doubleI1, [numPixels, 3] colorIdx  sub2ind[sizeI1, 1, sizeI1, 2], validPoints1,2, ...     validPoints1, 1 color  allColorscolorIdx,    add green point representing the origin points3Dend1,  [0,0,0] colorend1,  [0,1,0]   show images figureunits,normalized,outerposition,[0 0 .5 .5] subplot1,2,1 imshowpairI1, I2, montage titleOriginal Images   plot point cloud hAxes  subplot1,2,2 showPointCloudpoints3D, color, Parent, hAxes, ...

Negative 21990 pIm trying to implement an undo function for a very simple text editor. Currently, I have a stdvector that stores a userentered string for a specific row that acts as the current line number the user is on.p  pI was able to insert a character into the current string by using this codep  precodevoid EditorinsertCharactercharamp c      lines[row].insertcolumn, 1, c     column  codepre  pIn this case, I insert the character into the current row, at a specific column. This column acts as an index to where the cursor is supposed to be,  so by doing codecolumncode, the cursor moves one position to the right, after inserting the character. This method works fine. The problem Im having now is when Im trying to undo inserting a character.p  pBasically, I have to erase the character where codecolumncode is currently located, then decrement codecolumncode to achieve an undop  pThe first thing I tried to do was deleting the character like thisp  precodelines[row].erasecolumn codepre  pHere is an example of what happens when I run this where  is the cursor positionp  precodehello     user enters hello hello     user moves cursor back to column 2 hTESTello user enters the word TEST user hits ctrl  z which triggers undo hTES      final output codepre  pSo, I looked online and saw that I could use an iterator  an offset to delete an index of a variable. So I updated the undo function to look like thisp  pcodelines[row].eraselines.begin  columncodep  pBut this doesnt compile, and I get this errorp  precodeerror no matching member function for call to       erase     lines[row].eraselines.begin  column      codepre  pSo how should I erase this single part of the string without erasing everything remaining in the stringp

Negative 21990 pI am working on writing a little VBA code to gather some specific data from a large excel sheet. The Sheet contains an imported text file. Every few thousand rows or so the columns B,C,D read Total,Nodal,displacements. Then a table of values follows with various values at various nodes in the beam. There are around 7090 of these tables in around 50,000 rows of info. The text file can not be formatted any better than it is. I have a function to put into a formula to find 1 of the values. it looks like thisp  precodeindexB1D68604,Match1,B1B68604  TotalC1C68604  NodalD1D68604  displacements,0WhichNode1,3 codepre  p... where the whichnode is just which point I care about. Id like to write this in VBA with 2 boxes that pop up asking How many nodes are there, and Which node do you care about So that the code will scan the entire document, grab the displacement value I care about whenever Total Nodal displacements appears in columns B,C,D, lets say I want the displacement at the 29th node  that value will always be 30 rows and the same cell as the cell containing the string displacements. I cannot figure out how to write the script so that it will scan through the entire excel file and grab the data from the specific cell that I want. Any guidance would be helpfulp  p In response to some comments. The number of nodes changes depending on the parameters used to run the testing program  the program tests the strength of a beam until it fails depending on some input parameters. For each time phase there are roughly 58 nodes. So I normally care about the 29th node the middle of the beam at each time phage  60  80 typically, it depends on how long it takes the beam to break. I mainly want to be able to tell the program which node to look at. Normally I care about the 29th, but sometimes I want the 2nd or 57th near the endpoints of the beam. Does that make sensep  precodeTotal   Nodal   displacements    Node    u           v         theta 1   3.62E10   2.97E09   3.96E03 2   1.28E01   2.21E00   3.97E03 3   2.51E01   4.41E00   3.96E03 4   3.69E01   6.61E00   3.95E03 5   4.82E01   8.81E00   3.94E03 6   6.45E01   1.21E01   3.90E03 codepre  pA table like this appears a bunch of times in the excel sheet  whereever a new time phase is being entered.p  pThere are 64 nodes, but I normally care about the 29th one sometime I want others, that is why I want to be able to tell the VBA code to search for a specific one. I want it to grab the v value for whatever node I care about and bring it into another sheet so I can just focus on the v value for each node at each time phase as opposed to scanning through thousands of rows to get each value that I need.p  pEssentially I want a code that will say If celli,B  Total and celli,C  nodal and celli,D  displacements Then Copy cell i1SpecificNode,D into another shet in a column titled v values for node i or something like that... Does that make sensep  pThanks for your guys helpp

Negative 21990 pIm facing a strange behavior when using ColorFilter with drawables on Lollipop devices.p  pIm trying to change the color of some drawables for the whole application.  I used to do that by applying a ColorFilter on it, and then as drawables are sharing their ConstantState, all instances were modified. This is working great on pre lollipop device. However, when running on a lollipop device this seems to be broken and modifications could only be applied to a single instance. Here is a simple example that works fine on pre lollipop and not after thatp  precodeint color  Color.BLUE Drawable drawable  getResources.getDrawableR.drawable.iclauncher drawable.setColorFiltercolor, PorterDuff.Mode.SRCIN ImageView iv  new ImageViewthis iv.setImageResourceR.drawable.iclauncher addContentViewiv, new ViewGroup.LayoutParamsViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT codepre  pOn pre lollipop device image is blue, on post lollipop devices, image is unchanged.p  pAnd this example is working on both, but is only applied on this instance of that drawable and not when reusing it elsewherep  precodeint color  Color.BLUE Drawable drawable  getResources.getDrawableR.drawable.iclauncher drawable.setColorFiltercolor, PorterDuff.Mode.SRCIN ImageView iv  new ImageViewthis iv.setImageDrawabledrawable addContentViewiv, new ViewGroup.LayoutParamsViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT codepre  pAs far as I understand, this could be linked to Tint effect on Lollipop applying its own ColorFilter but ImageView here isnt clickable. So I tried applying setTint method on my drawable without success.p  pSo my question is what happened on drawabless constantState in Lollipop release, how can I get my snipnet to work again p  pThanks.p

Negative 21990 pGiven two tablesonly data, I want to find out all possible ways in which the two tables can be joined to produce significant results. Each way corresponds to a mapping of attributes from one table to the other. The strength of a join for a mapping M from table T1 to T2 is the percentage of rows from T1 that join to some row of T2 under the mapping M. I am interested in finding all the mappings that have support greater than a threshold t. This is a very expensive operation since the number of possible mappings is exponential in the number of attributes. Thus, I am thinking to consider sampling techniques for join discovery.p  pFor strongexamplestrong, consider a hrefhttpwww.tpc.orgtpch relnofollowTPCHa benchmark database. Say we were given the tables for strongcustomerstrong and strongordersstrong relation. We have raw data. We dont know what each attribute corresponds to. Now by seeing the data, we should be able to derive that customer.customerid and orders.customerid are strongjoin columns with high supportstrong but not customer.customerage and orders.customerid. Similarly we should find all joins possible and order them according to their support. Since checking every possible combination of attributes is very costly we need an efficient technique to be used.p  pReal usecase I am given a raw huge dataset where columns are isolatedassume 2 tables are there for simplicity. I want to discover what are the joins possible from it with support value efficiently.  Note Since I dont know anything about type of attributes, I am thinking to consider all of them as strings and use samplingp  pstrongI am clear that sampling is required. My questions are only the following.strongp  pWhat is a good sampling strategy here What metadata should be computed to decide the sample sizes Can the sampling of each table be done independently or should they be correlatedp
Negative 21990 pGetting a bit lost in the world of codetopcode and codefree mcode, and I wondered if anyone could shed some light on what Im seeing.p  pWe have a PHP app build with Laravel. Recently, weve added some queues and a handler to process items on that queue. To do this, weve installed codesupervisordcode and were running codequeuelistencode, a command built into Laravel that basically runs a PHP script infinitely to process items.p  pstrongNotestrong Im well aware PHP is not the best solution for this. Time contraints, existing technologies, etc, all reasons why we chose to go down this route.p  pI deployed this to our staging server yesterday, and when I logged on today, our monitoring was alerting that the used memory on the box was now above 90 it was 20 yesterday before install. I know from past experience that this isnt a bad thing. The used memory could just be cache andor buffers, but after logging on to the box I started to suspect it wasnt. codehtopcode for example was stating that most of the memory was used green bars.p  pGetting a bit stuck, I rebooted the box. When it came back up and everything was running, it had 15 used memory. After an hour, this was up to 25. Looking in codehtopcode again, I saw this was used, not cached.p  pI then went onto one of our production boxes that didnt have the latest changes on to compare, and that box had the same  of cached, but far less used, matching what Im seeing on staging. And its had about 15 used memory for as long as its been running.p  pI then stopped the PHP process by also stopping codesupervisordcode, and the used memory dropped ever so slightly, but not by much. This is probably just caching taking it I assumep  pIm fully aware Im probably misunderstanding something here, but its given me cause for concern. I dont want to run this process if something is eating andor leaking memory to the point the system will start paging. I just want to understand emwhyem our memory usage is slowly increasing so I know its not something to worry about, or is so I can fix it.p  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pInterestingly, were actually seeing this on 2 identical AWS boxes, one that is a test server and the other is staging.

Negative 21990 pI would like to do some audio and video analysis in Java.br In a bit more detail, I would like to identify the points in audiovideo that have either been monotonous for quite some time or have drastically changed compared to some previous state.  p  pIf you want to look at it in a mathematical way, I can try to explain it like this  p  pExample  p  blockquote   pYou have an audio file.   You should extract the waveform of that   audio file.   You could try to approximate that waveform with some   simpler function, that can be expressed as a closed formula.   Lets   call that function codeftcode.p blockquote  pNow, to find out how your function behaves is it increasing or decreasing at some point or interval, I guess I could use the first derivative,codeftcode.  If Id like even more information, I assume second derivative, codeftcode would also come in handy.p  pSo, if we assume we can do that then I guess Id have 1 piece of information about the audio.  p  pHowever, if Im not mistaken, audio files can also have spectrograms, so Im unsure how they fall into all of this.p  pSo, the real question goes here strongIs there a way to do this in Java efficientlystrong Ive been doing some digging and Ive found a hrefhttpscode.google.compmusicg relnofollow titleMusicGMusicGa, however, the last update date is July 2012, which leads me to believe this may be abandoned.p  pThe second part refers to video files, but without their audio component.br This is where Ill have more questions, so Im just gonna go and shoot them.p  pstrongHow do you identify points of change in pace in videosstrong p  pHeres an example  p  blockquote   pImagine the video shows car drivers point of view while hes driving   on a long, straight road. Since the surroundings are mostly the same,   the pace could be described as not changing much. At one point, the   road begins to curve but the driver, due to him falling asleep is not   following the road that precisely, so the surroundings start to change   somewhat, and so does the pace. At the apex of that curve there is a   tree, which grows bigger and bigger as the car is approaching it.   Here, the POV and the pace is changing quite a lot, since the tree   is getting bigger and bigger. In the end, the car crashes into a tree,   all hell breaks loose, the car starts to roll uncontrollably, which   indicates a really intense pace.p blockquote  pIm assuming one way could be to do an image segmentation and somehow determine which portions of the frames are changing, and how big are those portions to try to determine pace, but Id like additional input. p  pstrongIf anyone has had prior experience doing any sort of related work in Java, what approaches did you explore andor usestrong One thing that immediately comes to my mind is a hrefhttpsgithub.combytedecojavacv relnofollow titleJavaCVJavaCVa, but as I said, with my limited experience, Im unsure what to actually try.p

Negative 21990 pI am trying to solve the regression task. I found out that 3 models are working nicely for different subsets of data LassoLARS, SVR and Gradient Tree Boosting. I noticed that when I make predictions using all these 3 models and then make a table of true output and outputs of my 3 models I see that each time at least one of the models is really close to the true output, though 2 others could be relatively far away.p  pWhen I compute minimal possible error if I take prediction from best predictor for each test example I get a error which is much smaller than error of any model alone. So I thought about trying to combine predictions from these 3 diffent models into some kind of ensemble. Question is, how to do this properly All my 3 models are build and tuned using scikitlearn, does it provide some kind of a method which could be used to pack models into ensemble The problem here is that I dont want to just average predictions from all three models, I want to do this with weighting, where weighting should be determined based on properties of specific example.p  pEven if scikitlearn not provides such functionality, it would be nice if someone knows how to property address this task  of figuring out the weighting of each model for each example in data. I think that it might be done by a separate regressor built on top of all these 3 models, which will try output optimal weights for each of 3 models, but I am not sure if this is the best way of doing this.p

Negative 21990 pAs part of a system design, we need to implement a factory pattern. In combination with the Factory pattern, we are also using CRTP, to provide a base set of functionality which can then be customized by the Derived classes. p  pSample code below p  precodeclass FactoryInterface     public      virtual void doX  0   force all derived classes to implement customXimpl  templatelt typename Derived, typename Base  FactoryInterfacegt class CRTP  public Base       public     void doX          do common processing..... then         staticcastltDerivedgtthisgtcustomXimpl        class Derived public CRTPltDerivedgt      public         void customXimpl         do custom stuff           codepre  pAlthough this design is convoluted, it does a provide a few benefits. All the calls after the initial virtual function call can be inlined. The derived class customXimpl call is also made efficiently.p  pI wrote a comparison program to compare the behavior for a similar implementation tight loop, repeated calls using function pointers and virtual functions. This design  came out triumphs for gcc4.8 with O2 and O3. p  pA C guru however told me yesterday, that any virtual function call in a large executing program can take a variable time, considering cache misses and I can achieve a potentially better performance using C style function table lookups and gcc hotlisting of functions. However I still see 2x the cost in my sample program mentioned above.p  pMy questions are as below 1. Is the gurus assertion true For either answers, are there any links I can refer. 2. Is there any low latency implementation which I can refer, has a base class invoking a custom function in a derived class, using function pointers 3. Any suggestions on improving the design p  pAny other feedback is always welcome.p

Negative 21990 pThis is for a private wedding website. Invitations are sent to guests, which could be individuals or entire families. Those invitations include a special Passcode that lets them access the website. Once inside, in the RSVP section we have returned the names of the guests invited.  The goal is to allow whichever guest that has logged in to respond to the RSVP by clicking a box that says Yes Ill be in attendance or No I wont be attending. The question is available to all of the people in the group. Then the person can enter other info  offer a song suggestion for the wedding. Id like at that point for the entire form to be submitted altogether.p  pPROBLEM As soon as a guest clicks on Yes or No the form automatically submits, and then refreshes the page. At that point you cant see what selection was made any longer.

Negative 21990 pI have a restful api and the workflow of integration test cases is that we build the project  Then start a tomcat using maven on a predefined port  Deploy the built war on that tomcat instance and then maven runs the integration test cases with respect to that war. Build is succeeded only if the unit as well as integration test cases pass. I want to generate code coverage report for integration as well unit test cases. Though Jacoco is correctly generating report for unit test cases but it is not generating the correct report for integration test cases .

Negative 21990 pI am trying to make the player rotate and face a target position, and have encountered a problem I am unable to fix.p  pWhen the ship is rotating towards the target position, when it reaches directly below the target position, it goes crazy and moves left and right while going downwards away from the target position and eventually off the screen.p  pI do not want to limit the screen as it will look weird when it is slowly rotating if it is near the screen limit.

Negative 21990 pIm developing an Android app for salesman, so they can use their device to save their order. Specifically, every morning the salesman would go to the office and fetch the data for that day. p  pCurrently, I can get the data by sending a request to codephpcode file, and like common practice we insert those data into codesqlitecode in the Android so it can work offline. However, with current approach the device needs 68 seconds on getting the data and inserting those data to codesqlitecode. As the data grow bigger I think it would make it slower. What I had found is that the process of inserting data into codesqlitecode takes quite amount of time.p  pSo, Ive been thinking about dumping all data that is needed by the salesman into a codesqlitecode file, so I could send only that file which I guess is more efficient. Can you please lead me on how to do that Or is there any other way which is more efficient approach for this issuep  pNotep  ul liServer DB Mysqlli liServer PHPli ul

Negative 21990 pReact hot loading is very nice. p  pThere are some React components that are mounted after some user interaction. I want to implement these components separated from the application.p  pI dont want to separate them as different npm modules though. I just want to mount them to the landing page and implement.p  pThis is like having a test runner that runs each component separately not for testing, but for implementing it live changing css etc..p  pIs this possible somehowp
Negative 21990 pHi all quick question for you.p  pI have an SSIS2012 package that is reading a flat file .csv and is loading it into a SQL Server database table. However, I am getting an error for one of the columns when loading the OLEDB Destinationp  p[Flat File Source [32]] Error Data conversion failed. The data conversion for column ActiveFlag returned status value 2 and status text The value could not be converted because of a potential loss of data..p  pI am wondering if this is because in the flat file which is comma delimited, the values are literally spelled out TRUE or FALSE. The advanced page on the flat file properties has it set to DTBOOL which I thought was right. It was on DTSTRING originally, and that wasnt working either. p  pIn the SQL server table the column is set up as a bit, and allows nulls. Is this because it is literally typed out TRUEFALSE Whats the easiest way to fix thisp  pThanks for any advice p

Negative 21990 pIm tasked with managing and improving email marketing for my new employer. They regularly send to a genuine doubleoptin list of over 100K recipients. They are currently using IIS SMTP for this  and it works really well  but there is no DKIM capability without paying for a commercial plugin or external service.p  pI recently set up hMail server on an alternative port and switched the marketing software over to it for a test delivery with DKIM signing. Technically all went well, but the delivery took several hours compared to several minutes using IIS. I tried various configurations of threadsession counts during the delivery, restarting the server and resuming the queue each time to ensure the settings were applied, but this only marginally improved the speed. We send the campaigns at specific times for the best open rates, so waiting this long for a delivery to complete is not an option.p  pId like to be able to repeatedly test the delivery speed of hMail and other servers without damagingwasting a valuable campaign. Is there any way I can have hMail genuinely send thousands of emails in its own time, but somehow catch them so they are not delivered to the actual recipients  some kind of blackhole method or applicationp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 21990 pThe title might be a bit confusing, so I try to explain the problem Id like to pass Data to a SubReport, which is calculated in the code behind. So I created a DataSource, putted the SubReport in a Grid and set the DataContext to the Grid. This makes sure the SubReport gets called after the Data is calculated. Everything fine so far. But now the interesting part The SubReport has another DataSource, which has the same name as a DataSource in the Mainreport. This DataSource in the Mainreport gets now overwritten by the DataSource in the SubReport. Interesting enought, this happens ONLY IF THE SUBREPORT IS IN A GRID, otherwise it doesnt.p  pIs there any explenation for this behaviourp

Negative 21990 pThank you for your replies which are excellent. However on reading into HashPsi initial comment in much greater depth, I have discovered that several users all want to use this app with several different but very similar reports for instance there are a larger number columns available which can be includedremoved in any report specific to the user. p  pRather than make a solution for each user type, each user can simply view their data and select filters which initially importing it. To keep it very simple in the below edit at the row level I have set a very simple id and 20x Strings, then List preparses currencynumbers, which can be used to select dropdown number filters, or ranges between values.  A similar List is used for dropdowns of strings at sheet level.p  pThe finished application will use one database seperated by sheet idor similar.

Negative 21990 pI am trying to create a dynamic grid which contains tiles  there is one row and the grid columns have a  width.p  pAt larger resolutions, the width might be 30 but at lower resolutions it might be 50 or even 100  they are all floated left and this works fine for widths.p  pThe issue is when one of the columns has more content than the others hence is taller and it messes up the grid system and user could end up with row of 3 then row of 1 then row of 2.p  pI cant use minmax height in CSS as, depending on the user, the div might have 10 words or 1000 words. The row is actually a wrapper div as it incorporates multiple rows so setting a height on that doesnt work either.p  pHow can I create a dynamic responsive fluid grid layout using something like the below where all widths are the same and all heights are the same as the highest box  I dont mind using JSjQuery if it is needed which I suspect it will be.p  precodeltdiv idrowgt     ltdiv classcolgtCOL1ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolgtCOL2 Text added to this column so height is differentltdivgt     ltdiv classcolgtCOL3ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolgtCOL4ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolgtCOL5ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolgtCOL6ltdivgt ltdivgt  row      floatleft     border1px solid red   .col  floatleft width30 border1px solid black margin1  media screen and maxwidth 400px      .col width45  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8bnqbpnr relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net8bnqbpnrap

Negative 21990 pIve scoured the web and havent found any good examples for doing pattern scans of a byte array. I do pattern scans of memory using ReadProcessMemory that allow me to look for a pattern by passing some bytes, code74 C7 2F 00 00 02code and a match, codexxxxcode for instance.p  pI would like to do the same thing but with a codebyte[]code array in C.p  pThe best method Ive found for searching for a byte array inside a large byte array 20mb or so is this.p  precodepublic static unsafe long IndexOfBytesthis byte[] haystack, byte[] needle, string match, long startOffset  0                      fixed byte h  haystack fixed byte n  needle                              for byte hNext  h  startOffset, hEnd  h  haystack.LongLength  1  needle.LongLength, nEnd  n  needle.LongLength hNext lt hEnd hNext                     for byte hInc  hNext, nInc  n nInc  hInc hInc                         if nInc  nEnd                             return hNext  h                 return 1                       codepre  pThis works great for finding code74 C7 2F 00 00 02code but has no way of matching against code74 C7 2F 20 20 02code. Id like to use the same method of including a match parameter. I started on it, as you can see match exists as a paramater, but it doesnt do anything. The unsafe code is very confusing and after a few hours of sitting in a debugger trying to figure out what its doing, Im completely at a loss.p  pIm guessing theres an easy way to have it check the index of the current byte its matching and if its a  in the match to allow it to pass even if it doesnt match, then it goes to the next byte and if it is an x in the match it continues searching on. If it finds a byte array that completely matches up with the match then it returns. p  pAny help on this would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 21990 pFor a project I need to get some data from a Bluetooth device on windows 10 using C. Im not too familiar with the Bluetooth API and cant figure out why the following is not working p  pUsing the codeBluetoothLEAdvertisementWatchercode I search for advertisements, which works fine.

Next I try to connect to the device using the codeBluetoothAddresscode received together with the advertisementp  precodeprivate async void OnAdvertisementReceivedBluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher watcher,                      BluetoothLEAdvertisementReceivedEventArgs eventArgs      ulong blAdress  eventArgs.BluetoothAddress     BluetoothLEDevice blDevice  await           Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.BluetoothLEDevice.FromBluetoothAddressAsyncblAdress  codepre  pHowever, doing so results in an exception p  blockquote   pElement not found. Exception from HRESULT 0x80070490.p blockquote  pIs this the correct way to read data from the device Are other options available to read the data from the services Manually pairing the device in windows is not really an option and also seems to fail.p  pEdit 1 I check for the local name of the device to make sure I only try to connect to the right one. So I guess there is a problem with connecting to this specific device, still I have no idea how to work around that. The service data was succesfully read on iOS, so it should be possible.p
