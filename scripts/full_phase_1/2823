Positive 2823 pI have two functioning sites, one ASP.Net Web Forms and another is ASP.Net MVC. I am aware that it is entirely possible to have both work together in the same project, but virtually everything Ive seen online talks about adding new code to an existing site of the opposite type. p  pId kind of like to just move the existing MVC app under the WebForms app, but that seems too simple on the surface given some of the same directories AppData etc. Heres my question what are the gotchas Should I create a directory and just dump all of the MVC code in there, or should I move the components individuallyp  pJust looking for some best practice guidance if anyone cares to share.p  pVp

Positive 2823 pI have an asp.net webforms solution that uses Identity for authentication. Within the solution I have some webservices that handle ajax requests for the site. The controller apis require authentication, which is not a problem from within the solution, since they receive auth cookie from the session. Or atleast thats how I understood it.br strongQuestion isstrong how do I handle authentication when calling the webservice outside the solution, for example from an android app or an outside web page etc The calling user should be authenticated, so that only userrelevant data can be accessed.p

Positive 2823 pIm going to use a web service for sending SMS to customers cells.  My provider VodafoneRedbox sent me a WDSL file to use their services. I added a reference in my web application using that provided file, and I invoked the available functions successfully. No problems here.p  pThe trouble appears when trying to use the acknowledgment feature, to confirm that an SMS has reached its destination. For this feature, Vodafone asked me an URL to send confirmation messages in XML format. Thinking that would be a GET or POST to the URL an ASP.NET webform, I asked them for the method and parameter name, but their response was that no GET or POST is fired, just the system sends the XML to the URL. As far as I know, the only way to send something to a webform from another is with parameters via GET or POST, but Im aware that my skills are very limited and its possible Im wrong here.p  pTrying to figure out how to capture the XML sent, I got the idea of reading everything that went into the page whenever this was called, using Request.Params in PageLoad function. With keyvalue pairs in Params collection, construct a string and save it in database. p  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e       Connect to database       try              NameValueCollection valoresentrada  Request.Params         int numvalores  valoresentrada.Count         StringBuilder sbmensaje  new StringBuilder          if numvalores gt 0                      sbmensaje.AppendPage invoked with params.n             for int i  0 i lt numvalores i                              sbmensaje.AppendClave n  i  1.ToString     valoresentrada[i]                 sbmensaje.Append. Valor   valoresentrada.Geti                 sbmensaje.Appendn                               else                      sbmensaje.AppendPage invoked with no params.n                    Save page access and string to database           catch Exception ex               Save page access and error to database           finally               Disconnect database        codepre  pThe code works when I open the URL with browser obviously no XML is captured, but the access to the page is registered and the params collection is readed and stored in database. But when Vodafone supposedly sends the XML with the ACK, nothing is stored in the database, and this means that PageLoad function is not executed. Ive contacted Vodafone, but the answer is only that they dont provide support to the clients application development.p  pAt this point I dont know if the procedure is correct but should be implemented in other point of page lifecycle perhaps PageInit, if the procedure is absolutely silly, if theres another way to receive something sent to a page... Im totally lost and Im unable to find articles in Internet. Whenever I look for send XML to an ASP.NET page I find explanations on how to create a web service, but not how to collect a response sent by a web service. If anyone has ever had to deal with something like this, or have a clue that could help me, I will be eternally grateful.p

Positive 2823 pI have an internal .NET 4.0 web forms app with a sql server backend. I have a menu on the home screen that I need to showhide parts of based on which groups the user is in. I am struggling with the best way to do this. In the past I have called js functions from the code behind using ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript. However, I feel like this is bad practice and dont want to keep doing it if it is. I know I could just set my html table cells that need manipulating to runat server and add the property in the code behind when I lookup the users security. Should I do that and forget about trying to go back and forth between the code behind and js Or, is there a way to accomplish this that is good web programming practice p  pSeems like this is a common scenario, which is why I think Im missing something obvious. Lookup something from database, then execute js to manipulate front end. p  pNote I bounce between plain js and jQuery, so feel free to answer with either.p

Positive 2823 pI have a number of ASP.NET Web Form Websites the one with no .csproj file, and I am trying to figure out how to best use NuGet packages with them.

For other projects, I can use NuGet.exe with the restore command either against the csproj or the sln file, and the packages are correctly downloaded and included in the output.

Positive 2823 pI have two versions of a web form.  The original, in VB.  And the new one, in C.  They both do essentially the same thing, but the language is different, and the C version is a little improved featurewise and readabilitywise.  The difference on the .aspx page itself for each one is different by means of the autoeventwireup property on the Page tag.  Now, when I try to run the VB version I get the results Im looking for. The C version does nothing.  In the logs for each page I see that the VB version is getting a POST from the caller, and the C version is getting a GET from the caller.  So none of the Request.Form values are available to the C version.  Both pages when deployed are called by a separate web application.p  pVB Version page.aspxp  precodelt Page LanguageVB AutoEventWireupfalse CodeFileCustom Label Generator.aspx.vb InheritsDefault gt  ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml gt lthead runatservergt     lttitlegtUntitled Pagelttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt     ltdivgt      ltdivgt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pC version of page.aspxp  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindCustom Label Generator.aspx.cs InheritsCustomLabelGenerator.CustomLabelGenerator gt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt     lttitlegtCustom Label Generatorlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt     ltdivgt      ltdivgt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pVB Version codebehindp  precodeProtected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load      LogEventRequest to print  amp Date.Today      Try         If Request.Form.Count lt 0 Then             LogEventNo label data was submitted with the request.

Ive also tried undoing the autoeventwireup, but there doesnt seem to be a solid equivalent in C.  Im wondering if maybe this would be better as a WebAPI call, force it to only accept POST, and not mess around with any of the other kruft.  Im not sure if I have the time for that level of conversion, though, so a webformsbased solution would be appreciatedp  pUpdate  dump of Request.Form.Keys from VB version minus the emUSEFULem keys I

Negative 2823 pIm in the process of developing a multitiered financial processing application in Java using EJB3 Hibernate  Glassfish for the app and web services layer, Lift on Glassfish for the web UI and Im struggling with the question of where to put my business logic.p  pWhen this project started, our first notion was to put the bulk of our business logic into the stateless session beans. As time has gone on, though, weve found the dependency injection provided by the EJB framework too limiting, so a lot of our business logic has ended up in POJOs that are assembled by Guice in the PostConstruct method of the stateless session beans. This progress has led to fragmentation of our business logic between the session beans and the POJOs, and Im trying to figure out an approach for correcting this.p  pInitially, we tried to have our web tier use the remote interfaces of the session beans to perform some functions that are accessible both from the UI and from the web service layer, which is provided by WebServiceannotated stateless session beans. This turned out to be a nightmare from a persistence and performance perspective, because our entity graph can grow quite large and reattaching the detached entity graph to the persistence context turned out to be highly errorprone, so our solution was to start just passing object identifiers around and looking up the entities from the database wherever they were needed.p  pMy basic question is this what principles and guidelines can you suggest for deciding whether business logic should go in a session bean or a POJO When does it make sense to pass entity beans around, given a complex object graphp

Negative 2823 pA project I am working on requires values from a C application to update 6 values in an Excel sheet.

However, the label gets updated frequently without any problem even when the label.update method is not therep  pAdditional information  Say, I disable the button, then put a Thread.sleep and then enable the button  it sleeps first and then quickly disables and enables the button. So I believe all such paint requests are queued and are processed at the end of the execution.p  pbUseful informationb I realized that, when I create and display a MessageBox right after my display changes, the display changes occur. So, if I make the following change in my widgetSelected method p  precode button2.setEnabledfalse MessageBox mBox  new MessageBoxDisplay.getCurrent.getActiveShell, SWT.ICONINFORMATION  SWT.OK mBox.setTextInformation mBox.setMessageButtons updated mBox.open codepre  pthe button will be grayed out as soon as the widgetSelected method is called. This makes me believe my solution lies within Display.getCurrent methods. However, I tried p  pre Display.getCurrent.getActiveShell.redraw Display.getCurrent.getActiveShell.update Display.getCurrent.getActiveShell.layout  pre  pmethods and they didnt solve my problem.p  pThanks, Egep

Negative 2823 pI have a current implementation of strongwillpaginatestrong that uses the strongpaginatebysqlstrong method to build the collection to be paginated.

But we need to know a few things.p  ol liDo we display the previous link  This would only occur of course if records existing prior to the ones displayed in the current selectionli liDo we display the next link  This would not be displayed if the last record in the collection is being displayedli ol  pFrom the a hrefhttpgitrdoc.comrdocmislavwill5Fpaginateb3b0f593ea9b1da13a64bc825dfe17b6bbc2828bclassesWillPaginateFinderClassMethods.htmlM000140docsap  blockquote   pA query for counting rows will   automatically be generated if you   dont supply totalentries.

Negative 2823 pIm working on reducing the memory requirements of my AS3 app.  I understand that once there are no remaining references to an object, it is flagged as being a candidate for garbage collection.p  pIs it even worth it to try to remove references to Loaders that are no longer actively in use  My first thought is that it is not worth it.p  pHeres why My Sprites need perpetual references to the Bitmaps they display since the Sprites are always visible in my app.  So, the Bitmaps cannot be garbage collected.  The Bitmaps rely upon BitmapData objects for their data, so we cant get rid of them.  Up until this point its all pretty straightforward.p  pHeres where Im unsure of whats going on Does a BitmapData have a reference to the data loaded by the Loader  In other words, is BitmapData essentially just a wrapper that has a emreferenceem to loader.content, or is the data emcopiedem from loader.content to BitmapDatap  pIf a reference is maintained, then I dont get anything by garbage collecting my loaders...p  pThoughtsp

For example, the NewProject is implemented in terms of the New methodp  precodevoid ProjectNewProject    1.  Show dialog for whether to save existing project   2.  check whether the project was already saved   3.  if yes, only overwrite the existing project   4.  if no, show SaveAs Dialog   5.  ...   6. thisgtNew    codepre  pLine 1 to 5 is code that all of my programs need, i.e the flow and order in which the dialogs are created and checks are performed is the same. p  pI was thinking whether the actual code that creates the dialogs should be placed in the ProjectNew and ProjectOpen methods. After some thinking I decide that it is not good solution cause the Project class is model class, and model class should not create GUI. So, I was thinking maybe the best place to write the code from line 1 to line 5 , is in the SaveOpen buttons event handlers of the specific program. But that means that I will have to duplicate it for each program . p  pSo the question is how should I separate the creating of dialogs which will be the same for all of my programs  from the actual savingopening of the projects in way that do not require duplicating of code  p

Negative 2823 pIn my iPhone app, I am trying to get some red and white stripes that are scrolling across the screen to animate smoothly when the speed of the stripes gets high.  In my app the user starts the animation and changes the scrolling speed by a finger swipe and changes the width of the stripes by a two finger pinch.  Animation is stopped in response to a double tap.  If the speed gets high or the stripes get narrow the animation is no longer smooth to the eye.  The edges of the stripes seem to jump around.p  pThe animation is simple.  I draw the stripes in a layer thats a bit larger than the screen.  I then set up an animation that moves the layer position by exactly the distance from one red stripe to the next.  The duration is set by the speed of the finger swipe and the repeat count is 1.  When the animation stops the delegate checks a flag to see if the user wants to stop the scrolling.  If not, the animation is restarted again for one cycle.  Are there better ways of doing this so that the animation is smooth at high speeds or with narrow stripesp  pThanksp

Negative 2823 pI have developed a web application that uses a web server and database hosted by a web host on the ground and a server running on Amazon Web Services EC2.

And I think that this means that the best option is to store all  some of the data that I need in the database rather than in a session.

Negative 2823 pIm pretty new to Android app development, and Ive been playing around with swipe gestures using Androids SimpleOnGestureListener and a ViewFlipper.  There are 3 children of the ViewFlipper, and each is a ScrollView.  Theyre all dynamically populated when the Activity loads, and they dont change after that.  The ScrollView is where the SimpleOnGestureListeners are attached.  p  pHeres the layout Im usingbr ViewFlipperbr ScrollView x3, one for each page, each with the followingbr LinearLayout verticalbr TextViewbr TableLayout dynamically populated wTableRowsbr View  p  pI extended the onFling method with the common tutorial code you can find anywhere online, and it works greatexcept when one of the ScrollViews doesnt contain enough content to scroll.  p  pIve narrowed the problem down to touch detection by overriding and calling super on every one of the SimpleOnGestureListeners methods to add a printtolog.  p  pWhen I swipe on a page that scrolls, I get something full of in onClick in onScroll in onFling etc.  On a page thats too short to scroll, I get in onClick in onShowPress in onLongPress, and thats only if Im touching the content emwithinem the tooshort scrollviews childrenif I touch elsewhere I get no events at all.  p  pIdeas on whats wrong, or how to detect the swipe gesture no matter how big the ScrollView isp  pEDIT  Ive determined that when I run this on an Android 2.2 emulator, as opposed to the Android 2.1u1 DroidX emulator Ive been using, it goes away.  This is reproducible across multiple environments.p  hr  pI have some more insight on this  it seems as though onInterceptTouchEvent is not called for every motion event when a scrollview is contained within a flipper or a WorkspaceView.p  pIn particular, the behavior I found while modifying another view class to fix this very same issue it is not unique to flippers was as followsnote that this is Android 2.1 onlyp  pIf the scrollview is long enough to scroll, the ACTIONDOWN motion event is caught by the ScrollView, and every subsequent ACTIONMOVE event goes through onInterceptTouchEvent of the flipper, where it is intercepted and handled appropriately.  In android 2.2, this behavior happens regardless of the scroll length.p  pBack to 2.1  If the scrollview is not long enough to scroll, the ACTIONDOWN motion event is emnotem caught by the scrollview, but instead comes back to the onTouchEvent of the flipper.  All subsequent ACTIONMOVE events of the same gesture emskipem the onInterceptTouchEvent function and go straight to the onTouchEvent functionp  pThe way I resolved this was to take the functionality I had in onTouchEvent for ACTIONMOVE events and refactor it into its own method.

The RRDtool database is structured in such a way that it needs data at predefined time intervals. If it does not get a new value during the interval, it stores an UNKNOWN value for that interval. So, when using the RRDtool database, it is imperative to use scripts that run at regular intervals to ensure a constant data flow to update the RRDtool database.p blockquote

For instance I have a Home area and underneath this I would like the News area that handles its own route registration and will properly find views when a route points to a controller in the News area.  By changing the News area name to be HomeNews instead of simply News, the proper views are found.

Negative 2823 pIm trying to display some data points using google graphs, but unfortunately there is a limit of about 2000 characters to the length of the url I can use, which translates to roughly 200 data points limit I can use to display the graph. I have about 800 data points and growing, so I need to cut them down to 200 for the graph. Right now Im just cutting out X8002001 points then skipping one and repeat to get to 200.p  pHowever most data points are located at the beginning of the array since the points positions on the graphs are expanding somewhat exponentially about 1.2 exponent. Also the most important points are the most recent ones at the end of the array. So Id need a way to reduce the points array in such a way as to leave most points at the end of the array, and remove most but not all towards the beginning.p  pThis would be used each time the graph is made so it would have to be deterministic i.e. no random involved. If someone could point me in the right direction Id very much appreciate it.p

Negative 2823 pAfter deploying my rails 3 app in production I noticed that paths are not always shown in the browser window.  For example going to login or myprofile links would still only show a hrefhttpmyapp.com relnofollowhttpmyapp.coma instead of expected a hrefhttpmyapp.comlogin relnofollowhttpmyapp.comlogina or a hrefhttpmyapp.commyprofile relnofollowhttpmyapp.commyprofilea.  The views did change and were functional.  I could also see the database being hit and views being rendered from the logs which led me to believe it was not a simple browser cache issue.

Negative 2823 pIve configured a simple console app to work with log4net.

Negative 2823 pI have a JARpackaged standalone application that, when executed, unpacks itself into a temporal directory and spawns a child process within that directory. The reason being some thirdparty code and configuration assumes data files are found relative to current working directory, and java has no chdir method, so the only way is to switch the working dir for a child process.p  pAll works fine, except for the system properties. An operator may decide to specify some system properties in the command line, both standard ones and ones related to the thirdparty configurationp  precodejava Djava.io.tmpdirtemp Dsomethingelse jar foo.jar parameters codepre  pThe system properties available to the parent java process are not by default propagated to child. I should do it myself. And here I get into a roadblock I have no way to tell which properties are set by operator and which are initialized by default by JVM.p  pTake that java.io.tmpdir one. If operator has provided it, he has a good reason to do so perhaps the default location is disk full. I have to set it to child process, or it will fail. But how do I know if it came from operator It may be just the default value.p  pI may try and set strongallstrong available system properties to the child process. It takes a long list though and, worse, fails in some environments where the command line length is limited.p  pThe only workaround Ive found so far quite a wicked one is to spawn another child process first, with no arguments at all, and let it pipe back to the parent all the system properties it has.

Perhaps i have to study the manpages again and again. p  pWell  the DOMtechnique somewhat goes over my head  But my example is very simple and seems to comply to the examples given in the manual simplehtmldom.sourceforge AT netmanual.htm but it just wont work, its driving me up the wall.

The question is  how to parse itp  pShould i do it with Perl  The example HTML page is invalid HTML. I do not know if the Simple HTML DOM Parser is able to handle badly malformed HTML probably not. And then i am lost. p  pWell it is pretty hard to believe  but you can get the content with filegetcontents But you afterwards have to  do the parser job  And there i have some missing partsp  pFinally if i cannot get it to run i can try out some Perl parsers eg HTMLTreeBuilderXPathp

I really only need to test if a number matches the general a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiE.164E.164a form, rather than assuming its a NANPA.p  pTo be better understand what I need to match, here is an example from the Twilio Documentationp  blockquote   pAll phone numbers in requests from   Twilio are in E.164 format if   possible. For example, 415 5554345   would come through as 14155554345.   However, there are occasionally cases   where Twilio cannot normalize an   incoming caller ID to E.164. In these   situations Twilio will report the raw   caller ID string.p blockquote  pI want to match something like 14155554345, but not 415 5554345, 415555434, 5554345 or 5554345. The regex should not restrict itself to only matching the US country code though. Basically, it should match the xxxxxxxxxxx format. I also think the number could be longer, as there are multidigit country codes, such as in the UK. TMobiles UK number is 447953966150 Ill update this if I can come up with a better example.p

Negative 2823 pThe software I work written in C on has a heap corruption problem at the moment.  Our perf test team keep getting WER faults when the number of users logged on to the box reaches a certain threshhold but the dumps theyve given me just show corruptions in inoncent areas like when stdstring frees its underlying memory for example.  p  pIve tried using Appverifier and this did throw up a number of issues which Ive now fixed.  However Im now in the situation where the testers can load up the machine as much as possible with Appverifier and have a clean run but still get heap corruption when running without Appverifier I guess since they can get more users on etc without.  This has meant Ive been unable to get a dump which actually shows the problem.p  pDoes anyone have any other ideas for useful techniques or technologies I can use  Ive done as much analysis as I can on the heap corruption dumps without appverifier but I cant see any common themes.  No threads doing anything intersting at the same time as the crash, and the thread which crashes is innocent which makes me think the corruption occured some time before.p

Being more specific, suppose I have entity persisted with a code like thisp  precodeEntityManager em  emf.createEntityManager em.getTransaction.begin em.persistentity em.getTransaction.commit entityManager.close codepre  pSince I closed the EntityManager my entity instance is detached. Now suppose that I have other objects using this instance of entity. If I want to fetch the new state of this entity from the database, I pretty much cant use em.refresh because the entity is detached. The em.merge method returns a managed instance, and since is not the same instance of my object this can be a problem. I can foresee two solutionsp  ol licreate a new method in my entity object that updates its state using a given entity instance.li linot close the entity manager implications li ol  pSo, what I should do in this case How can I refresh the state of my entity object without losing all the references from other objects to it Ideasp

Negative 2823 pI am making a simulation that involves particles dynamically added to the stage lots of circles. When these circles collide which are actually movieclips they need to rebound momentum switched. I have no problem with the physics but do not know how to efficiently check for collisions.

Negative 2823 pI am writing an algorithm implementation using Java. Until OS X 10.7, I used the Shark Profiler to profile my implementation, which worked rather nicely.

It may be a viable workaround for what youre trying to measure  which is otherwise not a priority for the performance tools at this point.  You may want to start with the D script in usrbincpuprofiler.d and amend it to collect the jstack as well.p blockquote  pEdit 3 Alright, after some more discussion it turns out that the developer himself didnt know where that script came from. Apparantly, the time profiler in Instruments doesnt use DTrace anyhow, so the only option left is to write our own DTrace script or instrument.p  blockquote   pYoure right, and I apologize.  Im not sure where that script came from, and when I looked at it carefully, it doesnt have jstack actions in it so its not what you want anyway.  It looks like the only java profiling option I can offer you is DTrace.  DTrace has a profile provider, and a jstack action that collects java stacks.  You can use aggregates to determine the heaviest stack traces, and all of this works from the command line.  The documentation for DTrace is mostly maintained by Sun and Id direct you to any DTrace tutorial since most cover the profile provider.  p      pDespite what people say online, Instruments does not use DTrace for everything, specifically time profiling, so I cant offer you a quick fix in the Instruments UI.p blockquote

Negative 2823 pI am currently working on a project which has to use WebSockets as a way of transferring data to my client. The infrastructure looks like this.br  Client  Web Server  Microsoft SQL Databasep  pI think that the most ideal situation would be like this Client opens a socket to the Server. Server opens a socket to the Microsoft SQL Database. Whenever the database is updated some data has been inserted the DB writes the data to the socket. The server writes the data back to the client. This might be a bit tedious though, maybe I can somehow open a socket to the DB from the client directly p  pstrongI want to know if there is a way to automatically notify the socket to the web server if the MSSQL database is updated, so that it can process that information.strongp  pThe main question is really how will I make this work Ive looked into some projects which work with WebSockets like Node.JS and Socket.IO, also Tornado. Although I havent found any clues as to where to look for this specific feature. I have found some rather unstable drivers for the MSSQL databases for NodeJS but do not understand if there is any way to make a socket to the DB and instantly send the data through the socket when its pumped into the database.p  pI also realise that making a socket between client and db wouldnt be smart to say the least security wise, as for now thats not an issue, and that SQL is not the way to go for realtime applications but Im bound to it for now p  pstrongEdit 1strongp  pThanks to tomfanning I now know of a solution to this problem but seriously doubt the improvement in performance. Let me picture the situation for you. In the case that I would use the Trigger on the MSSQL database I imagine this happening.p  pstrongSituation 1strongp  ol liemThe database gets updatedem    li liemThe trigger is pulledem  li liemThe CLR script makes a connection to the Web Server. Either through a socket which it has to open and close for every trigger or through a HTTPS request which involves opening and closing a Header which is useless overheadem   li liemThe Web Server receives the trigger and emits the data to the client.em  li liemThe client updates.emli ol  pAnd now imagine the same scenario but then with AJAXp  pstrongSituation 2strongp  ol liemA timeout of 1000ms is set in the client for AJAX requestsemli liemThe client times out and makes an AJAX requestemli liemThe database executes some query and posts back the resultemli liemThe client updates.emli ol  pIn situation 1 you need both a request and a socket emitreceive and in situation 2 you would only need one request. If I were to set the timeout of the AJAX request to 10MS would it appear to the user as if it were a realtime application like a websocket Or would situation 1 still be more efficient and Im just exaggeratingp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2823 pWe build software that audits fees charged by banks to merchants that accept credit and debit cards.  Our customers want us to tell them if the card processor is overcharging them.  Pertransaction credit card fees are calculated like thisp  precodefee  fixed  variabletransactionprice codepre  pA fee scheme is the pair of codefixed, variablecode used by a group of credit cards, e.g. MasterCard business debit gold cards issued by First National Bank of Hollywood. We believe there are fewer than 10 different fee schemes in use at any time, but we arent getting a complete nor current list of fee schemes from our partners.  yes, I know that some fee schemes are more complicated than the equation above because of caps and other gotchas, but our transactions are known to have only codea  bxcode schemes in use. p  pHeres the problem were trying to solve we want to use pertransaction data about fees to derive the fee schemes in use. Then we can compare that list to the fee schemes that each customer emshouldem be using according to their bank. p  pThe data we get about each transaction is a data tuple codecardid, transactionprice, feecode. p  pcodetransactionpricecode and codefeecode are in integer cents.  The bank rolls over fractional cents for each transation until the cumulative is greater than one cent, and then a rounding cent will be attached to the fees of that transaction.  We cannot predict which transaction the rounding cent will be attached to.  p  pcodecardidcode identifies a group of cards that share the same fee scheme. In a typical day of 10,000 transactions, there may be several hundred unique codecardidcodes. Multiple codecardidcodes will share a fee scheme. p  pThe data we get looks like this, and what we want to figure out is the last two columns.p  precodecardid    transactionprice       fee        fixed        variable  12345      200                     22                      67890      300                     21                      56789      150                      8                      34567      150                      8                      34567      150    rounding centgt 9                      34567      150                      8                      codepre  pThe end result we want is a short list like this with 10 or fewer entries showing the fee schemes that best fit our data. Like this p  precodefeeschemeid       fixed     variable  1                      22            0 2                      21            0 3                                    4                                    ... codepre  pThe average fee is about 8 cents. This means the rounding cents have a huge impact and the derivation above requires a lot of data. p  pThe average transaction is 125 cents. Transaction prices are always on 5cent boundaries. p  pWe want a short list of fee schemes that fit 98 of the 3,000 transactions each customer gets each day.  If thats not enough data to achieve 98 confidence, we can use multiple days of data.  p  pBecause of the rounding cents applied somewhat arbitrarily to each transaction, this isnt a simple algebra problem. Instead, its a kind of statistical clustering exercise that Im not sure how to solve. p  pAny suggestions for how to approach this problem  The implementation can be in C or TSQL, whichever makes the most sense given the algorithm. p

Negative 2823 pI am setting up a system where polygons shapes morph into each other. I have got this working using svg animate, and by feeding new values into the points attributes on click of the object.p  pHowever I need to advance this so that the object morphs when a HTML button or element clicked.p  hr  pAs an example, this is what I aim to achievep  pI have four buttons onscreen 1, 2, 3, 4, and to the side of them, the polygon. 1 represents a larger polygon, through to 4 which is the smallest polygon.p  pI would like the page to load, displaying polygon 1. When 2 is clicked the polygon would morph slightly smaller until polygon 2 is achieved. There would be the option for the user to click on any button, and the polygon would morph from the current selection to the desired one, therefore being fluid through all possible selections.p  hr  pMy questions is how would I enable the animation using a html button or elementp  pI believe that once I know this, I would be able to create 4 animate tags for each button, so that the points attribute will be replaced with that of the new shape...p

However, when I attempt to do anything with Internet Explorer 8 and presumably before, I receive a File Download  Security Warning dialog box. I believe this dialog box pops up because the browser doesnt know how to handle the contenttype produced by a JsonResult applicationjson, and so prompts the user to save the return value instead. However, changing the content type in the JsonResult method to, say, textplain or texthtml, doesnt work either. Instead,  IE8 redirects the browser window to display the raw JSON sent back. Neither of these behaviors works for me.p  pI have the sense that the problem stems from the top, which is to say that the ajaxification of an Ajax.BeginForm form simply doesnt happen in IE8, but I could be wrong, and in any case, I dont know what to do about it. p  pAny cluesp  pThanks.p

Negative 2823 pI have multiple divs with a fixed width and height think about some sort of catalog view with article pictures. Now I want to show them similar to the behavior of floatleft. This ensures that the larger your browser window is, the more divs are shown in one row.p  pThe downside of the floatleft solution is, that there is a big white gap on the right side, until another div will fit. Now I have the job to distribute the divs evenly one the page, and instead of a big white gap on the right side, there should be evenly distributed gaps between the single divs.p  pA solution in JavaScript is easy a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2719942csscolumns.htmlhttpdl.dropbox.comu2719942csscolumns.htmlap  pYou can see, if you resize the browser window, it behaves similar to floatleft, but the space is evenly distributed between the boxes. The column and row count is dynamically calculated with JavaScriptp  precode  function updateLayout      var boxes  document.getElementsByClassNamebox     var boxWidth  boxes[0].clientWidth     var boxHeight  boxes[0].clientHeight     var parentWidth  boxes[0].parentElement.clientWidth       Calculate how many boxes can fit into one row     var columns  Math.floorparentWidth  boxWidth       Calculate the space to distribute the boxes evenly     var space  parentWidth  boxWidth  columns  columns       Now lets reorder the boxes to their new positions     var col  0     var row  0     for var i  0 i lt boxes.length i        boxes[i].style.left  col  boxWidth  space  px       boxes[i].style.top  row  boxHeight  px        if col gt columns          col  0         row                codepre  pNow I wonder if there is a solution without JavaScript I would prefer a CSSonly solution, because I will have possibly up to hundreds of divs on one page.p  pI looked into a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRcss3flexboxCSS3 Flexible Box Layouta, but this seems to be only useful for fixed column layouts. In my example, the column count gets calculated dynamically. Then I tried a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRcss3multicolCSS3 Multicolumn Layouta, which I could get something similar working, but the divs are aligned vertically, cut off in the inside, and the browser support isnt there yet. This seems more useful for text, but in my case I have fixed divs with pictures, that shouldnt get cut off.p  pSo my question is can I realize something like this without JavaScriptp

Negative 2823 pfirst time post here. I am using classic ASP vbscript on a windows 2008 server with IIS7.

Any idea what could be causing this behavior or possibly some sort of workaroundp

Negative 2823 pIn my project I currently have two databases, one that is named ASPNETDB.MDF and another named School.sdf.  ASPNETDB.MDF was created by the .net Default Membership Provider, I made the second one using Entity Framework.  When I go to make this project live, all this information needs to be contained within the same project.  How would I make the app function correctly as if there was only one database instead of the two how would I merge all of that data, or at the very least build a blank database that was ready to be seeded with all necessary information, my School context and the Default Membership Provider information.p  pCan anybody give me a help on thisp
Negative 2823 pI am on Centos 4 and am using killpid, 0 in my C program to check whether there is presently a process running with the given pid. I am beginning to suspect that there is a race condition whereby shortly after a process has started, there is a small window of time wherein the killpid, 0 does not return zero even though there is actually a process running.p  pIs this a known issue  Will kill ever return nonzero when a pid actually exists but has just been started  If kill is not a reliable to test for existence, is there a better way to perform this testp

I need to find a way to make it open link in new window. Some help would be awsome or just a point in the right direction. p  pThanks for all the help in advance.p  precodeimport spynner from PyQt4.QtWebKit import  from PyQt4.QtNetwork import   site  httph34dz.blogspot.com201205myfavoritecars.html  b  spynner.Browser b.createwebviewTrue b.loadsite b.debuglevel  spynner.DEBUG  x  b.webframe.findAllElementsimg l  QWebElementCollection.toListx  for elem in l     print current element to click, elem     print clicking link     b.wkclickelementlinkelem     print link clicked      b.wait7      print current link is , b.url codepre

Negative 2823 pI have seen in focused web crawling a.k.a. topical web crawling, the evaluation metric  harvest ratio  is defined as after crawling strongtstrong pages, strongharvest ratio  numberofrelevantpagespagescrawledtstrong. p  pSo for example after crawling 100 pages I get 80 true positives then the harvest ratio of the crawler at that point is 0.9. But the crawler might have ignored some pages off crawling that are totally relevant to the crawling domain but is not accounted in the evaluation ratio. What is this Can we improve that evaluation metric to include the missed pages that are totally relevant Is this consideration importantp

Negative 2823 pWe have a typical ntier java application, and I noticed that our data access layers has DAOs that are of the type FooDAO and FooDAOImpl. I was looking to justify the need for the two and here is my analysis.p  ol liIf you had multiple implementation for the same interface, the abstraction is helpful. But given that we have already made the choice of the framework to be used for the DAOImpl say iBATIS, is it really requiredli liHelp in proxying via Spring. From what I gather, classes that have interfaces can be proxied easily going the JdkProxy route rather than classes that have no interfaces where the cglib route is chosen and one has the subclass the class to be proxied. Subclassing has its problems where the class to proxied is final or has none default constructors  both of which are highly unlikely at the data access layer. Performance used to be a factor, but from what I hear, it is no longer a cause of concern.li liHelp in mocking. Classes with interfaces are more suited to be mocked by mocking frameworks. I have only heard this, but not seen it in practice  so cant really count on it, but maybe because of the same factors as mentioned in 2 above.li ol  pWith these points, I dont feel the real need for a separate FooDAO and FooDAOImpl where a simple FooDAO should suffice. Feel free to correct any of the points that I have mentioned.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2823 pI am trying to create a report where, as an example, it would look like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEirfv.png altenter image description herep  pI have been able to get this to work with subreports however there are two problems with this approachp  p1 Subreports are extremely inefficient. They make a call to the database for every row and column for each of the subreports in Books, Stories and Articles.br 2 When used within CRM 2011, you can only have one parent report per subreport which precludes being able to reuse subreports.  I have a Landscape and Portrait version of the same report landscape has additional columns and I would like to reuse the same subreports but this seems to be unsupported.p  pMy question is whether I could craft a large dataset which contains all the joined properties and then nest a table within a parent table and use filters to only display the correct data within each cell.  To put it another way, the parent Table would have the Authors Name and Email, then there would be 3 sub tables, one in Books, stories and Articles.p  pI have tried putting in a filter into the subtables but I get an error sayingbr The definition of the report ReportName is invalidbr The tablix tablix3 has a detail member with inner members.  Detail members can only contain static inner members...p  pThis makes no sense to me because the email Field is an inner member and it is not static.  Anyone out there know how I should better approach this  Just to preempt the response Change the design of the report, I cant.  This is how the users want to see the data.  I will accept answers which keep this layout but change the underlying implementation, but not answers along the lines of make 3 separate reports.p  pThanks in advance for your attention.p

Negative 2823 pIve created my own transition animation between views.  I animate two properties, the position and the transform, to provide a cubelike transition between views. The frame uses codeCABasicAnimationcode while the transform uses a 2stage codeCAKeyframeAnimationcode. Everything works fine except for one small detail I cant seem to figure out.  In my transition I apply a codeCATransform3DScalecode on the middle key frame to create a zoominzoomout effect.  That works fine except the animation looks slightly jerky.  Its animating the between the key frames in a linear fashion, and I would like to smooth that out.  Now codeCAKeyframeAnimationcode has a way to do that using codecalculationModecode, but it doesnt seem to work for transforms.  Ive tried setting it to codekCAAnimationCubiccode and codekCAAnimationCubicPacedcode with no effect.  p  pHere is the code that animates one views transform a similar block of code animates the other viewp  precode    CAKeyframeAnimation aTransform  [CAKeyframeAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform]     CATransform3D transform1  RotateOnXtoView, MPI4     transform1  CATransform3DScaletransform1, RotationalZoom, RotationalZoom, RotationalZoom     [aTransform setValuesArray[NSValue valueWithCATransform3DRotateOnXtoView, MPI2],                                 [NSValue valueWithCATransform3Dtransform1],                                 [NSValue valueWithCATransform3DRotateOnXtoView, 0]]     [toView.layer addAnimationaTransform forKeytransform] codepre  pNote codeRotateOnXUIView , CGFloatcode is a block that returns a transform for a view rotated on X by the desired Radians. p  pAs you can see I only set a scaling transform on the middle key frame.  Also, the rotation of the view is perfectly smooth, its only the scaling that appears to jerk as it changes direction. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how to smooth out the scalingzooming  p

Negative 2823 pIn C a stack overflow usually leads to an unrecoverable crash of the program. For programs that need to be really robust, this is an unacceptable behaviour, particularly because stack size is limited. A few questions about how to handle the problem. p  ol lipIs there a way to prevent stack overflow by a general technique. A scalable, robust solution, that includes dealing with external libraries eating a lot of stack, etc.pli lipIs there a way to handle stack overflows in case they occur Preferably, the stack gets unwound until theres a handler to deal with that kinda issue. pli lipThere are languages out there, that have threads with expandable stacks. Is something like that possible in Cpli ol  pAny other helpful comments on the solution of the C behaviour would be appreciated. p

Negative 2823 pI have some time series data that represents cumulative sums of a number of data series over time, basically money flowing in and out of a market. Some are positive and some are negative, but the different strands of data do of course sum to the money flow for the market as a whole. I have been mulling over how to visualise this using codeggplotcode and so far small multiples seem to be the clearest way to go  see below for image and code.p  pDoes anybody have any other suggestions for a striking visualisation with such data, using R and preferably codeggplotcode I have tried using codegeomareacode but that gets very messy and I cant seem to work out a way to have each data series shown clearly, even after playing with the codestackcode keyword.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzQNJs.png altsmall multiplesp  precoderequireggplot2 requirescales requiregridExtra  mymelt lt structurelistmydate  structurec15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15340, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15371, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15400, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15431, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15461, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15492, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15522, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, 15553, class  Date, variable  cb, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, b, bc, f, in, it, l, of, o, pr, s, total, tr, value  c23, 6.90000000000001, 459.799999999999, 403.6, 56.1, 95, 13.8, 32.6, 121.5, 15.7, 26.2000000000007, 12.5, 25.1, 238.3, 1047.2, 803.2, 151.5, 260.5, 59.6, 93.8, 461.5, 37.7, 26.7999999999993, 288.8, 46.4, 249, 1289.8, 783.2, 188.1, 414.9, 77.7, 61, 928.4, 36.8, 17.4000000000015, 841.7, 46.5, 276.2, 1384.8, 541.1, 71.8999999999999, 433.3, 61.3, 28.3, 494.699999999999, 23.4, 14.5999999999985, 964.5, 46.1, 376.2, 1020.1, 119.4, 56.8000000000001, 447.7, 9.50000000000001, 14.2, 9.20000000000164, 2.5, 42.7999999999993, 880.6, 52.9, 345.5, 892.599999999999, 241.8, 144.3, 428.2, 3.30000000000001, 91.9, 294.800000000002, 5.19999999999999, 42.1999999999971, 490.1, 64.5, 379.7, 679.299999999999, 143.1, 185.9, 419.8, 4.30000000000001, 182.4, 421.900000000002, 1.80000000000001, 59.8999999999978, 435.2, 80.2, 422.2, 645.499999999998, 391.4, 76.6000000000001, 387.4, 1.70000000000001, 211.2, 131.500000000002, 10.6, 40.8999999999978, 393.6, fill  cA4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, A4D3EE80, A478AB80, 01AEF080, 8DC73F80, F8931D80, FFAAAA80, 8C8C8C, D38D5F80, 23238E80, 77B9B780, C8373780, EEDD8280, .Names  cmydate, variable, value, fill, row.names  cNA, 96L, class  data.frame  myvals lt mymelt[mymeltmydate  mymeltmydate[nrowmymelt],]  last date in mymelt should always be same as plotenddate as we subset earlier mymelt lt withinmymelt, variable lt factorvariable, as.charactermyvals[ordermyvalsvalue, decreasing  T,]variable, ordered  TRUE  p lt ggplotmymelt, aesx  mydate, y  value       geomareaaesfill  variable, position  stack       facetwrap variable, ncol  4       themeaxis.text.x  elementtextsize  8, angle  90, colour  grey50       theme printp codepre

Negative 2823 pIm using the above control note its the ASP.NET one. I seem to see lots of people using a similarly named one written in javascript to allow upload multiple uploads of files with a progress bar, dragndrop, etc. That part all works fine but I need to return two pieces of data along with the file. Specifically, its a user entered latitude and longitude that comes from two text boxes. Since the upload control is async, the contents of the text boxes dont get posted back so I cant access them. There seems to be a property I can hook into, ContextKeys, which will send the data back to the server, but its a static field and I dont know how to manipulate it dynamically. Ive tried hooking the ontextchanged events from the textboxes and using those to set the context keys. The post back works and it seems to set the value, but when the user presses the upload button the ContextKeys value is empty.p  pDoes anyone how to programtically set the ContextKeys property, or another way to send data back with the uploadp  pHeres the codep  p.ASPXp  precodeltdiv stylefloatleft width 325pxgt     ltcc1AjaxFileUpload IDAjaxFileUpload1 runatserver Width325px           onuploadcompleteUploadComplete ClientIDModeStatic gt     ltcc1DynamicPopulateExtender IDAjaxFileUpload1DynamicPopulateExtender          runatserver EnabledTrue PopulateTriggerControlID          TargetControlIDAjaxFileUpload1gt     ltcc1DynamicPopulateExtendergt ltdivgt ltdiv stylefloatleftgtLatitude     ltaspTextBox IDtbUploaderLat runatserver          ontextchangedtbUploaderLatTextChanged AutoPostBackTruegtltaspTextBoxgtltbr gt     Longitude     ltaspTextBox IDtbUploaderLon runatserver         ontextchangedtbUploaderLonTextChanged AutoPostBackTruegtltaspTextBoxgt ltdivgt codepre  pcodebehindp  precodeprotected void UpdateLatLon this is called from the two events above      AjaxFileUpload1.ContextKeys  tbUploaderLat.Text    tbUploaderLon.Text  codepre

Negative 2823 pIm using Delphi 5 and Im creating a number of panels at runtime, then creating buttons on the panels, obviously again at runtime.  I need to do it this way because I may need to dynamically create more panelbutton combinations in the future.  p  pI can do all of this, but Im at a loss as to how to reference the panels Ive created, because I cant find a way to access the panels component name.   Hunting around the Internet Ive found that I can use FindComponent to find the panel components by name, but I still dont know how to use that name, because I cant use a string variable to refer to it  e.g. StringVar  Panel.Name.  I get a type mismatch, TComponentName versus String.p  pI created the buttons for each panel as I created the panels.

Ive tried using a component array, but I strike the same problem  I need to refer to the component by its assigned component name.p  pOkay, Im not a gun programmer  Ive used Delphi for years to create simple programs, but this one is a lot more complex.  Ive never worked with runtime component creation before.p  pCan I use FindComponent to make the panels visible or invisible   If so, given what I have shown you above, can you give me the approach I should take in babystepsp  pThanks in advance ...p

Negative 2823 pI have a doctrine entity which is being persisted to the database without me ever calling persist or flush.p  pIve managed to reproduce the problem quite simply below. As you will see, this script loads a row from a database table called MyEntity and obtains a php object with the rows fields as attributes. The script then changes one of the attributes, but does not call persist or flush. Then the script create an empty transaction which does nothing.

Negative 2823 pok, so we are supposed to make a program that simply reads proper input for a date in the format of mmddyyyy. All I  have learned so far are ifelse statements, touched on enums a bit, string processing, switch statements, and thats pretty much it. I figured the best way to go about this was to use a delimiter of  to capture each month day and year input separately, but when I run  what you see below, the program literally just stops after you enter, say 5161985......to clarify the program is actually still running, but nothing happens i.e. the expected string process and the output of their values. Once I type in the date, it just does nothing, and I was wondering why Did the delimiter not work Am I thinking of using a delimiter in the wrong way Its driving me crazy lol, any advice would be nicep  pAlso wanted to add that I tried this both with creating strings after the delimiter as you see below and with just trying to capture INT values using nextInt.....still does the same thing and nothing happens after the initial date entry....p  precodeScanner keyboard  new ScannerSystem.in  keyboard.useDelimiter  String month  keyboard.next String day  keyboard.next String year  keyboard.next  int monthi  Integer.parseIntmonth int dayi  Integer.parseIntday int yeari  Integer.parseIntyear  System.out.printlnmonthi System.out.printlndayi System.out.printlnyeari codepre

Negative 2823 pI dont have a clear understanding over how core data really works. May be this is the result that I am facing. I have an application in which I use a single strongmanagedObjectContextstrong through the application. I know that managedObjectContext holds over all the managedObjects in it and until I reset the context, the object is always retained by the context itself. So, what I do is I fetch some main object like User data and then keep on passing the same object throughout the view controller. If some changes occur then the object is refreshed by the some other code. This works pretty well in almost all cases.p  pBut, I do not keep strong pointer to the object in any strongviewcontrollersstrong. I just keep a weak reference over it, since the object is itself retained by the managedObjectContext pool. But, I some times have problem with this strategy, when the object is refreshed by syncing to remote. My weak pointer becomes useless. It has no data in it. All the attributes becomes empty. Although it shows all the attributes name when I log, the values are just nil. How do I make sure that my object is always refreshes and is sync with the main context  Is this way of doing keeping weak pointer to managedObject a bad idea. I would say I dont retain it in any viewcontroller. All the view controllers just use weak pointer.p  pMy code would look like this,p  pIn the root view controller I fetch the data,p  precodevoidtableViewUITableViewtv didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPathindexPath   User user  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]   FirstViewController firstViewController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierfirstViewController]   firstViewController.user  user  codepre  pstrongFirstViewControllerstrongp  precodeinterface FirstViewControllerUIViewController   propertynonatomic, weak User user end codepre  pI do many things with the object here and in the mean time, I may update the object from the rootViewController. But, since it is the same object it appears to be updated most of the time.p  pThen again in first view controllerp  precodevoidtableViewUITableViewtv didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPathindexPath   User user  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]   SecondViewController secondViewController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifiersecondViewController]  codepre  pstrongSecondViewControllerstrongp  precodeinterface SecondViewControllerUIViewController   propertynonatomic, weak User user end codepre  pHere again, the object is referenced weakly. I do many things with the object or some other view controllers may sync from remote but it keeps on updating. This object is passed to the deep hierarchy until the last view controller, and all of those view controller keep weak pointers to it. p  pMost of the time it is quite fine. But, many times in my current view controller even if the object is synced to network, it appears to be null, I mean the object is still there with all the property descriptions but has not values in it. But, then appears suddenly after some time.p  pWhat might have happened. How do I keep the object synced to the root context and refresh when any changes occur  Keeping a strong pointer, would this be able to solve all my issues.

I have not used codemodproxycode before, but I believe that it will be required for this task.p  pbr strongBackgroundstrongp  pThis is part of a project that I am working on in which the webhost is private, but the server cannot be modified. I am required to specify all subdomains using their tool, as opposed to creating the rewrites myself. This question pertains to a subdomain being used as a development site, which will eventually go live without being a subdomain, e.g. codesub.example.comcode will become codesub.comcode when it goes live. The reason why I cannot simply set the root folder of the subdomain to the directory that I am redirecting to is that the code base for the project relies heavily on the codeDOCUMENTROOTcode for internal link management, and the target folder, codesub.example.comsubdir1code, is not the root of the site.p  pbr strongWhat I have donestrongp  pemI will start by saying that I have exceeded my allotted time to work on this problem, mainly out of interest.emp  pI have done a lot of research and have tried to pull bits and pieces from the sources that I have looked at.

In fact, the only reason that the aforementioned page did have information related to my question is because the user who asked the question accidentally did what I am currently trying to do.

You can get around this by doing cat  .a.out. Dirty trick, I know, but setting up a small example with named pipes or sockets would be more complicated.p  pNow, everything works and the file is removed from the epoll set, but then the next epollwait call blocks permanently since its on an empty set So I would need to detect if the epoll file descriptor epfd is an empty epoll set.p  pHow can I get around this in a general manner, not just calling exit when stdin is done Thanksp

The function codeuniquecode does not allow one to specify precision, and I was unable to find source code for modification. p  pOne idea I had was thisp  precodeErrorReductionltfunctionmatlist, tol2   len lt lengthmatlist   diff lt matlist[[i]]matlist[[i1]]   fori in 1len1      ifnormdiff,ilttol      matlist[[i1]] lt matlist[i]            matlistltuniquematlist   returnmatlist  codepre  pbut this only looks at pairwise differences. It would be simple but most likely inefficient to do this with nested codeforcode loops. p  pWhat methods do you know of, or what ideas do you have, of handling the problem of identifying and removing matrices that are within machine error of being duplicatesp
Negative 2823 pIn my ASP.Net MVC4 project, I have a form in a view and a controller method that handles the submit of the form.  In the controller method, I have a formcollection parameter to retrieve the submitted form values.  The first time I post, the formcollection correctly shows all the values I entered in the form.  If there is a issue with field validation, I redisplay the same view so the user can correct the issues.  The problem I am having is that when one or more form field values are changed and the form is resubmitted back to the same controller method, the Formcollection does NOT show the updated form values.  Instead it still contains the values from the first form submission.  Why is this happening  How can I make the formcollection show the updated values on form resubmission  p

Negative 2823 pSo the Wikipedia page for path tracing a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPathtracing relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPathtracinga contains a naive implementation of the algorithm with the following explanation underneathp  pAll these samples must then be averaged to obtain the output color. Note this method of always sampling a random ray in the normals hemisphere only works well for perfectly diffuse surfaces. For other materials, one generally has to use importancesampling, i.e. probabilistically select a new ray according to the BRDFs distribution. For instance, a perfectly specular mirror material would not work with the method above, as the probability of the new ray being the correct reflected ray  which is the only ray through which any radiance will be reflected  is zero. strongIn these situations, one must divide the reflectance by the probability density function of the sampling scheme, as per MonteCarlo integration in the naive case above, there is no particular sampling scheme, so the PDF turns out to be 1.strongp  pThe part Im having trouble understanding is the part in bold. I am familiar with PDFs but I am not quite sure how they fit into here. If we stick to the mirror example, what would be the PDF value we would divide by Why How would I go about finding the PDF value to divide by if I was using an arbitrary BRDF value such as a Phong reflection model or CookTorrance reflection model, etc Lastly, why do we divide by the PDF instead of multiply If we divide, dont we give more weight to a direction with a lower probabilityp

Negative 2823 pI have a parent class, say class P and three child classes, say C1, C2 and C3. I have a codetypecode variable in class P to determine the type of child class. I have a vector of P which contains several instances of C1, C2 and C3 and I convert that vector object to JSON using Gson library. When i reconstruct the vector from JSON using Gson giving the type as VectorltPgt I use TypeToken for that i get a vector of class P, but when I cast the P object to any of the child class depending on the codetypecode variable I get ClassCastException. How can I achieve this without exception p  precodeType t  new TypeTokenltVectorltPgtgt .getType Vector psVectorltPgtgson.fromJsonjsonString,t forP pObj  ps       ifpObj.type  1          C1 cObjC1pObj          else ifpObj.type  2          C2 cObjC2pObj          else ifpObj.type  3          C3 cObjC3pObj       codepre

Negative 2823 pGot a problem  on the server where CQ is run there used IIS dispatcher to make pages accessible with the short url. It results as follows you can skip several parts of url for example, instead of codesite.comendepartmentunitcountrytopicpage.htmlcode can adress codesite.comcountrytopicpage.htmlcode.p  pIve got a codeSlingAllMethodsServletcode servlet, that needs full page path to store some data about the page like number of visitors, likes, etc. as it identifies the page. But when the servlet is called from a page with shorten url, all info I can get from SlingHttpServletRequest and Resolver returns this cut path, while I need it to be full.p  pSo my question is  is there a way to get a full page path in this case in codeSlingAllMethodsServletcode when the path to page is cut by dispatcher Or is there a way to get this information from some JS objects so I could pass in as a parameter to the servletp  pThanksp

Negative 2823 pNow Im working in a small team and just start doing some architecture. So may be there are some misunderstanding of terms or knowledge.p  pFor software development, there are some process Im already aware and clear. For what Ive known, architecture is like a highest level of a project, which shows how this project work. Some of them including Use case diagram, class diagram or maybe interaction diagram, etc. p  pMy question isp  ol lipShould architecture be designed before actually coding Currently there are lot of changes when we are implementing a feature, some of them may change the architecture. That means every changes need to update some interaction diagrams and class diagrams so far, which waste time. pli lipFor what im understanding, architecture is more useful for a big project or system. While for a small project, may be have a architecture doesnt help a lot. So is architecture really necessary for a startup project or we can implement a basic project and have architecture later when it growspli lipMay be im wrong about architecture and you guys can help me find out. Now what Im doing is based on our discussion what needs to be done. I came up and draw some flow chart or diagrams first. Then think about Class Diagram and some Interaction Diagram. After finish them, I start coding.pli ol  pAgain, Im just a university student and not even graduate. So I dont have so much experience and all of knowledge of software development are came up by my own mind. Apology for anything not correct.p  pThanksp

The behavior I see is that the cursor is positioned more or less under the point where I touch the UITextView to start editing  perhaps at the end of the word I touch on.  I have tried setting the textview.selectedRange in both strongtextViewDidBeginEditingstrong and strongtextViewShouldBeginEditingstrong but that had no effect at all.  I tried selecting ranges of the existing text,  like 1,2 and that didnt do anything either.

Negative 2823 pI have a PyQt QWidget object A it is just a pasive container that contains several child widgets i.e. there are Qtish parentchild references. As child widgets are referenced from another object object B not necessarily a Qt object that feeds As children with data and actually controls the creation and structure of the As children. Apart from As children, object B has no other outer references. Object A has a reference to object B. So, it is a pure textbook example of circular references. p  pI want, at some time point, delete the whole interconnected structure of objects A and B. I simply call codeA.deleteLatercode which is recommended for Qt objects. It seems to me that it works fine and deletes A and B because they have no outer references, just the mutual ones... but the thing is that I am not very sure about if it really works, if it can be relied upon it will work everywhere and if there are any dangers if someone will subclass B for example.p  pFor debugging purposes I wanted to observe proper destruction of A and B using codedelcode destructor that would just print something like codeA was destroyedcode. But then I learned in the docs that when codedelcode is present, the garbage collector will not collect such objects with circular references. Does this mean that observing the destruction will affect or cancel the destruction If I am right this seems to be something like quantum mechanics  the existence of observer that affects the result of an experiment.p  pSo basically there are two questionsp  ol lipis this use of codedeleteLatercode correct and reliable andpli lipDoes message printing in codedelcode destructor affect the garbage collector Or what other ways I can use to observe and confirm destruction during debuggingpli ol

Negative 2823 pI feel this must be asked elsewhere, but I couldnt figure out the correct search words to find an answer. If this is a duplicate, please point to correct response elsewhere.p  pServices like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Im sure a whole host of others allow you to follow other users. Their posts then appear on a wall or dashboard. Im wondering how, with such large data sets, these services can pull posts so quickly. I assume they are not using a SQL server and they are not doing something likep  precodeSELECT  FROM posts WHERE posterid IN  super long list of users being followed  ORDER BY date LIMIT 10 codepre  pAs the above could have a very large list of user ids in it, and it likewise wouldnt work very well with sharding, which all these large services use.p  pSo, can anyone describe what kind of queries, algorithms, or databases these services use to display the followed postsp  pEdit Thanks for everyones responses. It seems like the most likely way of doing this is via a graph database such as GraphDB, Neo4j or FlockDb, the latter of which is Twitters graph database. With Neo4j, it is done something like what is documented at a hrefhttpdocs.neo4j.orgchunkedmilestonecyphercookbooknewsfeed.html relnofollowhttpdocs.neo4j.orgchunkedmilestonecyphercookbooknewsfeed.htmla.p  pOf course, Google, Facebook, etc., all have their own, internally built or internally modified databases for their unique use cases.p

The children also have signal handlers, but they are made to ignore all kill signals.p  h2Problemh2  pThe problem is, according to the a hrefhttpupstart.ubuntu.comcookbook relnofollowdocsa...p  blockquote   piThe signal specified by the kill signal stanza is sent to the process group of the main process. such that all processes belonging to the jobs main process are killed. By default this signal is SIGTERM.ip blockquote  pThis is concerning because, in my child process, I run system commands through a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.procopen.php relnofollowprocopena, which spawns new child processes as well. So, whenever I run codesudo stop audiodaemoncode, this subprocess which happens to be a hrefhttpsox.sourceforge.net relnofollowsoxa is killed immediately, and the job returns back with an error. Apparently, sox obeys SIGTERM and does what its told...p  pOriginally, I thought, Fine. Ill just change codekill signalcode to send something that is inherently ignored, and Ill just pick it up in the main process only. But according to the a hrefhttpunixhelp.ed.ac.ukCGImancgisignal7 relnofollowmanuala, there are only two signals that are ignored by default SIGCHLD and SIGURG and possibly SIGWINCH. But Im afraid of getting false flags, since these can also be triggered other ways.p  pThere are ways to create a custom signal using what the a hrefhttpunixhelp.ed.ac.ukCGImancgisignal7 relnofollowmanuala calls Realtime Signals but it also states...p  blockquote   piThe  default  action  for an unhandled realtime signal is to terminate the receiving process.ip blockquote  pSo that doesnt help...p  pCan you think of any way that I can get upstart to keep all of my subprocesses open until they complete I really dont want to go digging through soxs source code to modify its signal handlers, and while I could set SIGCHLD, SIGURG, or SIGWINCH as my upstart kill signal and pray nothing else sends them my way, I cant help but think theres a better way to do this... Any ideasp  pThanks for all your help p

Negative 2823 pI am new to Django CMS.

Negative 2823 pI am trying to write code to produce confidence intervals for the number of different books in a library as well as produce an informative plot. p  pMy cousin is at elementary school and every week is given a book by his teacher. He then reads it and returns it in time to get another one the next week. After a while we started noticing that he was getting books he had read before and this became gradually more common over time. p  pSay the true number of books in the library is N and the teacher picks one uniformly at random with replacement to give to you each week. If at week t the number of occasions on which you have received a book you have read is x, then I can produce a maximum likelihood estimate for the number of books in the library following a hrefhttpmath.stackexchange.comquestions615464howmanybooksareinalibraryhttpmath.stackexchange.comquestions615464howmanybooksareinalibrarya .p  hr  pstrongExamplestrong Consider a library with five books A, B, C, D, and E. If you receive books [A, B, A, C, B, B, D] in seven successive weeks, then the value for x the number of duplicates will be [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3] after each of those weeks, meaning after seven weeks, you have received a book you have already read on three occasions.p  hr  pTo visualise the likelihood function assuming I have understood what one is correctly I have written the following code which I believe plots the likelihood function.

Negative 2823 pI am back again with another question regarding dvwa, Ive upgraded to MsSQL 2005 this time, and I have another set of questions. I dont understand a couple of things. I would like for some kind individual to make it clear to me.p  pSo basically, as usual  my goal is to obtain all databases from the DVWA, as well as escalate to the admin panel using manual injection techniques.p  pWhat I have so far is the database, but I am getting a little confused with the change in syntax. I asked the server to get the databases, and it returned me with the first database. My query is as followsp  precode and1     convert             int,dbname       codepre  pMy first question is  how can I edit this query so that I will be able to see all the databases, because from my knowledge, this query only drops the 1st database in the SQL data. Okay, my second question is, the first database that was dropped was information, when I looked for the tables using this queryp  precode and1     convert              int,                   selecttop1tablenamefrominformationschema.tables               codepre  pIt returned the first table of that database. Firstly, lets say I have more than the first database, how can I change this query to get the tables for whatever that database name would be. Secondly, the table it returned was tblinfoid.p  pTake note, the server is running IIS 6.0, on coldfusion. As I am aware, to request the next table from that database I would have to create a query such as this onep  precode and1     convert             int,                   selecttop1tablenamefrom               informationschema.tableswheretablenamenotintblinfoid               codepre  pHow come when I write it, the server responds with p  precode[SQLServer]Incorrect syntax near tblinfoid. codepre  pThats all, if anyone can explain all this to me, it would be greatly appreciated Cheers.p

Negative 2823 pI have a csv file which I need to import on a phpbased system  Magento to be specific. There is a field which contains the description of a product and is whitespace formatted for indentation as well as dashes  used for list items. I could use a codeltpregtcode tag and display it as it is, but when I got the csv file, somehow the lines which could fit in a single line had already moved to another line. So there is no real success trying to replace rn with codeltbrgtcode or using the codenl2brcode function because I do not want something that can fit in one line to be displayed in two lines.p  pI am not sure if this can be achieved with php, VBA routine in Excel or some Magento extension I am using MAGMI at the moment and it does not have such facilities.

Negative 2823 pIm just working on my first Web API 2 Single Page Application in Visual Studio 2013. When I started with the project I chose Authentication Individual Accounts.

Negative 2823 pI use Jenkins a lot within our organization, for building and deploying projects. I have a set of bash scripts finetuned to be modular and reusable for multiple projects. These are triggered by Jenkins during deploy jobs.p  pThe problem comes when the deployment environment changes from Linux to Windows. The bash scripts are no longer an option installing cygwin on multiplerandom deployment machines is also not an option. I could rewrite all the bash scripts in batch, but that would result in dualmaintenance and tiny bugs slipping into either of the environments.p  pWhat I am looking for is a crossplatform ability to write deployment scripts, and something that Jenkins can support out of the box, without having to preinstall something on the target environment. ANT comes to mind as Jenkins can run Ant on either Windows or Linux without having to install anything, but by the very definition as a declarative language, Ant is missing everything that I need to write a deployment script.p  pWhat are my alternativesp

Negative 2823 pIm trying to figure out how to apply a Design Pattern to existing objects to plot different methods of the object.p  pI know how to plot in Java.  I have my objects already defined.

Theres plenty of folks that advise against this in Java.  There must be a more elegant way to handle this, but I cant quite see how to map this to an existing design pattern.  Is the answerp  precodeplotMethodmyObject, Method A, xMin, xMax codepre  pThis is like issuing a command to the plotting object and handing them the object.  Then my plotting object works with the interface defined to operate with the class that represents the instance of myObject.  It has to spend a little time figuring out the string command, but otherwise can select the appropriate method to plot.p  pIs there a better way  Thanksp

Negative 2823 pAlright so I didnt really know how to word this question, but I did my best.  The goal I am trying to accomplish is to go through categories using a foreach loop.  Inside the category foreach loop another foreach loop will go through Numbers.  Right now it is grabbing ever value in the tables and storing them into an array.  My goal is to only store the highest number in each category into the array.p  pHere is how the tables would lookp  precodeCategory Table    Title        NumberId  Type            1 Priority        2 Likelihood      3  Numbers Table  Order        NumberId   3              1   2              1   1              1   3              2   2              2   1              2   3              3   2              3   1              3 codepre  pSo my goal would be instead of storing every order value into the array.  I would like to store the highest number according to each number id.  So there array would include 3,3,3.p  pThis is what I have that stores every number into an arrayp  precodeint[] values  new int[count]  foreachvar x in Category     foreachvar w in x.Numbers           values[y]  w.Order       y      codepre  pSolutionp  precodeint[] values  new int[count]  foreachvar x in Category     foreachvar w in x.Numbers            values[y]  x.Numbers.Selecto gt o.Order.Max        y        break       codepre

Negative 2823 pI am trying to create an automated coded UI test using Microsoft Visual Studio CodedUITest C for a login process using a username and password I am quite new to automated testing, but I have got some the basics down.p  pI have an Excel file that contains usernames and passwords.

Negative 2823 pI am quite new to Clojurescript and LISPy languages, so please excuse my imperative way of thinking.p  pIm using Raphael.js to draw some things.

What I cant quite figure out with my limited grasp of Clojure is how to do such a thing in a fairly idomatic way without resorting to a codedoseqcode somewhere else. I dont want side effects. Id like to somehow create a list of pushes and then have them all compose themselves into my block inplace.

Negative 2823 pIm evaluating Spring Datas support for Couchbase, and have have run across the following issue.  Consider the following pseudocode example where Ive two POJO classes, and a repository defined and instantiated for eachp  precodepublic class Foo      Id     private String  id      Version     private Long    rev       .. Other data and members.   public class Bar      Id     private String  id      Version     private Long    rev       .. Other data and members.      Repositories   Repository public interface FooRepository extends CrudRepositoryltFoo, Stringgt    Repository public interface BarRepository extends CrudRepositoryltBar, Stringgt   codepre  pBoth repositories are utilizing the same Couchbase bucket.  Nextp  precode Create a new Foo object and save it. Foo f  new Foo id1  fooRepository.save f    Now, try fetching a Bar object using the ID of a Foo object  Bar b  barRepository.findOne id1  codepre  pThis results in a Bar object being returned, but not properly initialized  no exceptions are raised.  The question, is why isnt an error indicated in this scenario  It seems like not much of a stretch to raise an exception when the requested type doesnt match the persisted type.  Am I missing somethingp  pFWIW, When I look at the raw documents in Couchbase via the admin console, I observe that each  contains a class property with presumably could be used to identify classes used to represent the data, and detect such mismatches.   p

In the copy constructor I copied each character to a new allocated memory space but Im not sure its necessary because if I would change the string later a new memory block will be allocated for the object that is changing leaving the other object with the same pointer untouched. Wanted to hear you opinions. str is of type char.p

Negative 2823 pWe have attempted to package and deploy GridGain 6 as a custom static module within our JBoss 7.1.1Final application server. When run locally, the configuration appears to work and grid jobs are executed by the local node, but when a job is executed on a remote node we get a ClassNotFoundException which appears to indicate that the module code cannot find a class that is contained within the EAR file that is deployed in that instance of JBoss. p  precodeCaused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException com.our.company.CustomGridJob from [Module com.gridgainmain from local module loader 5e48a0e1 roots pathtojbossmodules]   codepre  pFrom initial debugging it looks like the GridGain module is attempting to unmarshal the serialized message it receives from the network and is looking for the class to construct to initiate the job that it was sent. When the same job is executed locally we assume the serializationunmarshalling part doesnt happen as there is no network to traverse, so local execution works.p  pThe class it is looking for is present in the EAR deployed to the server so it would appear to be a classloading visibility issue.

The problem I am having is that the coordinates Im receiving from the device are assuming the 0,0 point is in the bottom left, where the PB draws these boxes starting from the top left. Is there a way to change the orientation of the starting point being drawn in the g.drawRectangle Or another method. p  pWhat I have tried so far is to add codepbzoneImage.bottom  newEndPointX  pbZoneImage.Width ....code in the coderectPointEndcode and coderectPointStartcode points. It doesnt seem to work and gives me negative values. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo this is what I ended up doing to fix it.

Negative 2823 pWe are having an issue when waiting in a thread on MacOS and the main window is hidden, the wait function takes up to 10 seconds even if we request it to wait 100ms.p  pThe main program is running on a Cocoa window, and an other thread is running permanently, waiting 100ms every iteration.

The referenced A objects are not owned by B. class B      Aamp ma0     Aamp ma1       Some other properties    Class C could hold an unbounded number of Aamp references.  The referenced A objects are not owned by C. class C      ListltAampgt maList       Some other properties    Class D holds lists of objects.  The objects are owned by D.  The A references held by objects of type B or C  refer to instances of A objects that class D owns  ie. entries in maList. class D      ListltAgt maList     ListltBgt mbList     ListltCgt mcList       Some other properties  codepre  pEach object has the ability to send a notification on certain events in my usage context, this is a Qt C signal that other objects can respond to. The following properties holdp  ul liemAem object emits a change notification when any of its properties are changed.li liemBem object emits a change notification if it receives one from either of its referenced emAem objects, or if any other of its own properties change.li liemCem object emits a change notification if it receives one from any of its referenced emAem objects, or if any other of its own properties change.li liemDem object emits a change notification if it receives one from any object in mbList or mcList, or if any other of its own properties change.li ul  pMy problem occurs when the following setup existsp  ul liAn instance of emDem, strongd0strong, holds some number of emAem, emBem and emCem objects.li liThere exist a emBem object strongb0strong and a emCem object strongc0strong such that they have at least one emAampem, stronga0strong, in common.li liA property on stronga0strong is changed stronga0strong sends a change notification.li liSince stronga0strong is a referenced component of both strongb0strong and strongc0strong, strongb0strong and strongc0strong both send change notifications.li listrongd0strong receives both of these consecutive notifications and so sends two of its own change notifications, even though there has only been one overall change in the state of strongd0strong.li ul  pSince in reality I am acting upon the change notification from emDem objects in order to rebuild their visual representation in 3D, responding to a emDem change notification is costly and so the above situation is both inaccurate and inefficient in the context of the application.p  pThe following approaches I have considered are not viablep  ul lipRestricting all access to emAem objects through mutator methods in emDem, so that if a property on an emAem object is changed then the mutator method sends the emDem object notification once only. This is not viable because it may be useful to pass around a reference to an emAem object, and when the emAem reference is modified externally then the emDem change notification should still be sent. This method might also require separate mutator methods for each and every property in emAem, which would be a nightmare to maintain.pli lipOnly send a emDem change notification when an emAem notification is received and ignore notifications from emBem and emCem objects. This is not viable because emBem or emCem objects may have other internal properties which would cause a change notification to be fired, and in this case emDem would still need to send its own notification in response.pli ul  pIs there a scalable solution to this problem I would like to achieve behaviour where, for each individual change of a single property of a component belonging to emDem, emDem would fire one change notification.p

Negative 2823 pCan anyone give me a concise explanation of how and why DirectShow DirectSound Audio Renderer will adjust the rate when I have my custom capture filter that does not expose a clockp  pI cannot make any sense of it at all. When audio starts, I assign a rtStart of zero plus the duration of the sample numbytes  mwfx.nAvgBytesPerSec. Then the next sample has a start time of the end of the previous sample, and so on....p  pSome time later, the capture filter senses Directshow is consuming samples too rapidly, and tries to set a timestamp of some time in the future, which the audio renderer completely ignores. I can, as a test, suddenly tell a sample it must not be rendered until 20 secs in the future StreamTime  UNITS, and again the renderer just ignores it. However, the Null Audio Renderer does what it is told, and the whole graph freezes for 20 seconds, which is the expected behaviour. p  pIn a nutshell, then, I want the audio renderer to use either my capture clock or its own, or the graphs, I dont care but I do need it to obey the time stamps Im sending to it. What I need it to do is squish or stretch samples, ever so subtly, to make up for the difference in the rates between DSound and the oncoming stream whose rate I cannot control.p
Negative 2823 pWe have a system made in java using a postgres database.  This database changes often, and once a week or less we are updating it. These changes are in the struture of the DB DDL, usually in functions and fields to add new functionality. p  pFor the changes in the DB we usually use navicat as follows  1 We made the change in the structure of the DB using navicat and we copy the SQL that gives us to an XML file for each change we made.  2 When we have to update the DB in production we check files, identified by a version number, and update the DB.  3 Then we repeat this for each DB installed 30 in total p  pThe problem that we are having is that as the whole process is manual and is very easy to forget to copy a change to the XML so when we use it the script does not work or even worse when the system needs this change fails. p  pTherefore we are looking for a way to automate this task and we came with the following idea  1 We make changes in navicat  2 Configure the postgres to LOG the changes in the DDL into a CSV file  3 Later we read the CSV file and pass the changes to the XML to update the producction DB p  pThe problem we are having is that the LOG will save all attempts to change the structure, including errors so if we use that script to update it will fail too. p  pIs there some way to save only successful DDL changes in the log in postgres p  pIs there a script or application to get the DDL changes and put it in script automatically p  pIs there a better way to automate this processp

I would love to be able to use the play javascript router to connect to my webservice but Ive got a couple of problems that are prohibiting me. p  p1 I cant embed the full domain name in the routes, as it appears to be intended only for use when served by the play server, and routes are relative to the server. In phonegap, I need the full domain name. Is there a way to specify the base URL for the callp  p2 Im doing extensive modularization using browserify, which requires export statements on all local files so that the varsfunctions can be imported into my javascript code using require..libjavascriptRouter.js. After browserifying the file, it goes through a minification step, which will mangle names if the dependencies arent managed by browserify. The current javascript router does not generate these exports. Is there a way to generate these p  p3 This one is more of an annoyance than anything. I would like the generated javascript router to be made available at some configurable target build path, instead of trying to track it down manually. Is there a way to do thisp
Negative 2823 pi have been struggling to understand the following question.p  pIs zeromatrix necessarily memory efficient does zeromatrix cost less memory or does it not cost any memoryp  pI tried to verify it in java but it turns out the memory has been allocated for the specified size.p  pI am not sure about CC or other language like matlab and octave and how they manage the matrix and vector memoryp  pThe reason why i am asking this is want to build a sparse matrix with huge size, but most of entries are zeros, it turns out that java is not a good choice, because zeromatrix in java still cost much memory. Does any one have any experience with this problem not sure how you deal with it, your help will be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 2823 pWhen we create a new table in Azure Mobile Services Data, it creates a [deleted] column along with others like [createdAt] etc. This is good, in case if I have to soft delete a record, I set deleted  true, instead of permanently deleting it. brbr My question is, when we query a MobileServices table say from client side or in server scripts using table.read or mssql.query, do I need to specify deletedfalse in each readquery explicitly or is there any app level configsetting available in MobileServices that we can set so that it doesnt return the records with deletedtrue by default.p

Unfortunately I am not able to fund this much amount of money. As per developers, i need to do bulk upload in two sections and after the first part i have to get the entry id manually  and insert it in  the CSV file of the second part.It seems really difficult. I would like to know whether it is possible to bulk upload in an easy way rather than spending lots of money.  Unfortunately i cannot upload any images . So if you can go to this link, then you will get some idea.a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshhhrx8j34ilee4k1AABhizYD0xtAydWqjBXyXgGGadl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comshhhrx8j34ilee4k1AABhizYD0xtAydWqjBXyXgGGadl0a It would be very helpful if anyone can help me by giving an answer.  Thanking you Josephp
Negative 2823 pthis is my first stack overflow post and I am a relatively new R user, so please go gentlyp  pI have a data frame with three columns, a participant identifier, a condition factor with 2 levels either Placebo or Experimental, and an outcome score.p  precodeset.seed1 dat lt data.frameCondition  crepPlacebo,10,repExperimental,10,                    Outcome  rnorm20,15,2,                    ID  factorrep110,2 codepre  pI would like to construct a bar plot with two bars with the mean outcome score for each condition and the standard deviation as an error bar. I would like to then overlay lines connecting points for each participants score in each condition. So the plot displays the individual response as well as the group mean.If it is also possible I would like to include an axis break.p  pI dont seem to be able to find any advice in other threads, apologies if I am repeating a question.p  pMany Thanks.p  pp.s. I realise that presenting data in this way will not be to everyones tastes. It is for a specific requirementp
Negative 2823 pFirst off, Im a newbie in programming, please bear with me guys. Im working on an iOS game built using the Cocos2Dx engine in Xcode. The game has a Share button which is used to share scores. The button seems to work with the iPhone but crashes all the time on an iPad. Xcode points to this line each time it crashes on the iPadp  pcodeint retVal  UIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil, AppControllercodep  pI figured this issue came about after I changed another piece of code to implement the functionality of the share button.

Negative 2823 pI got 3 tables articles, categories and relations. p  pAn article can be assigned to more than one category, and relations table is in charge of tracking that. And one more thing to note, articles table has a longtext type field articlecontent. And the indexes of the tables are articles.articleid, categories.categoryid, relations.relationsid. For the articles table, there is another index articletitle, articlecontent, but I dont it would be used in this case.p  pThe problematic query is likep  precodeSELECT COUNTarticles.articleid  FROM articles, relations, categories  WHERE relations.articleidarticles.articleid AND       relations.categoryidcategories.categoryid AND        relations.categoryid1566 AND        articlestatus IN approved,featured AND       articleexpirydate00000000 OR articleexpirydate gt now codepre  pTherere initially 21k records in articles, 1.9k records in categories and 25k records in relations table. The time used to run the query is about 0.0019 second. p  pWhat I need to do is deleting articles, relations, categories records which are in a specific categories. And within this categories, there are child categories and articles. So I run some query to get a list of the categories recursively and put the list in an array tmparray.  Then for each array, I deleted articles assigned to it, then delete the category itself and at last delete the relations, with a simplest queryp  precodeForeachtmparray as cat      artquery1  DELETE phpkbarticles                    FROM phpkbrelations, phpkbarticles                    WHERE phpkbrelations.categoryid  cat AND                         phpkbarticles.articleid  phpkbrelations.articleid      mysqlqueryartquery1,connection      artquery2  DELETE phpkbcategories                   FROM phpkbcategories                   WHERE phpkbcategories.categoryid  cat      mysqlqueryartquery2,connection      artquery3  DELETE phpkbrelations                   FROM phpkbrelations                   WHERE phpkbrelations.categoryid  cat      mysqlqueryartquery3,connection  codepre  pThis goes well. And after the deletion, there are 19k records in articles, 1.6k records in categories and 22k records in relations table.p  pThen I run the problematic query again, now the time is about 0.1 seconds, almost 50 times worse than before. I have to run this query for likely thousands times so the result is a huge time difference. p  pAlso, Im very curious about why there is such kind of performance difference. As the query stays the same and the records number actually decreases, there is no reason for that.p  pIs there anything wrong about query or did the DB get messed up upon the deletion of records Can anybody help to answer my questions Thanks a lotp

Negative 2823 pIm working on developing an app for Android tablets thats meant as a way to read credit cards and process the payments through a clients NetSuite ERP system. I used wsdl2java from Apache.CFX to generate the java files for NetSuites web services. However, most of the class files import from javax.xml and javax.jws.p  pAs a means to resolve this, as Eclipse would not compile when using rt.jar in the project library, I used jarjar to refactor rt.jar so that those references were instead made to ns.javax. Doing this and bringing the refactor jar into the library eliminated the errors piled up in the Problems tab. However, it still wouldnt compile, as Java core references were still being made.p  pSo I made the next logical step, and with jarjar refactored all java and javax. Now I get new errors, for the most part now all stemming from the following all over the web services classesp  precodeThe constructor QNamestring, string is undefined codepre  pI changed the import to remove the new class prefix, but then just created new errors as various other classes and objects couldnt be defined throughout the web services files.p  pI cant seem to find much in the way of relevant resources to get this working as all of my searches turn up references to other NetSuite apps for Android that are available, and nothing about consuming the web services on the Android platform. Right now, I can only guess that Im going about this in a halfcorrect fashion at best.p  pAre there libraries out there I can use to replace rt.jar that will work on the Android platformp  pstrong EDIT strongp  pI thought Id add an example of some of the core imports being made causing this issue...p  precodeimport javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElementDecl import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRegistry import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessType import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType import javax.xml.namespace.QName codepre

Negative 2823 pSo far I am able to get a button to create a new image element, but that is about it.

It works fine. p

Negative 2823 pIn my impression, when talking about improving IPC performance or lower the latency involved, context switch seems to be the most important factor. But I was always wondering why Ive never heard that the number of runnable processes is also a factorp  pIf I understand correctly, context switch can be performed by hardware for most of modern CPUs, which should greatly reduce the time wasted to do that. On the other hand, CPU time is shared by all the runnable processes in the system. The more runnable processed are there in the system, the less frequent a process gets a chance to gain CPU control. Although in general most of processes should be in sleep state for most of time, but its just an unreasonable assumption of the system which cannot apply to every possible case I think.p  pSuppose, for example, a system is configured to have roundrobin scheduler, 1ms of time slice and 7 runnable processes with the same priority as followsp  precode    P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 codepre  pBy definition of roundrobin scheduling, the context switch order should bep  precode    P1 gt P2 gt P3 gt P4 gt P5 gt P6 gt P7 gt P1 gt P2 gt ... gt P6 gt P7 gt P1 gt P2 gt ... gt P7 gt P1 gt ... and so on codepre  pDue to the context switch order above, if P1 tries to send out a message via some IPC mechanism to P5, the message will be handled by P5 after 3ms later. Thats because P5 needs to wait for P2, P3 and P4 having consumed their own time slice so P5 eventually gets scheduled to run and handle the message sent by P1. So the IPC latency is at least 3ms in the case, which is much larger compared to the time needed for a context switch which is typically s order of magnitude If P5 wants to give a reply regarding to the message P1 have sent, another 2ms is wasted because P6 and P7 have to finish their turn beforehand. And the roundtrip delay time a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiRoundtripdelaytime relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiRoundtripdelaytimea should be 3ms  2ms  5ms p  pIf the number of runnable processes is raised as followsp  precode    P1 P2 P3 ... P99 P100 codepre  pthe IPC latency for a message sending from P13 to P57 will be 57  13  1ms  43msp  pSo in conclusion ... Does the issue described above really exist Will one take into account the number of runnable processes while testing or measuring performance for IPC Or why number of runnable processes in the system doesnt matter in terms of IPC performancelatencyp

Negative 2823 pI am new to R and rvest. I am trying to use these to get information from a website www.medicinescomplete.com that allows sign in using the Athens academic login system. In a browser, when you click on the athens login button it transfers you to an athens login form. After submitting the user credentials the form then redirects the browser back to the original site but logged in. p  pI used the submitform function to submit the credentials into the athens form and this returns a 200 code. However, R does not follow the redirect as a browser would and if I use the jumpto command to return to the original site it is not logged in.

Negative 2823 pIm new to gulp, and I have a project running that produces a HTML5 QR code scanner with some functionalities around it. For this scanner, I need several 3rd party Javascript files. When Im running gulp serve, there is no problem, the camera does what I order it to do, but when Im running gulp build, it doesnt find the javascript files, and I think the reason for this is that bower does not inject these files into the main app.js. p  pI have tried to adapt my scripts.js  file in the gulpdirectory like thisp  precodeuse strict  var gulp  requiregulp var browserSync  requirebrowsersync  var   requiregulploadplugins  module.exports  functionoptions    gulp.taskscripts, function         return gulp.src[options.src  app.js,   options.src  appscancamerajsqrcodescanner.js]       .pipe.jshint       .pipe.jshint.reporterjshintstylish       .pipebrowserSync.reload stream true       .pipe.size     codepre  pbut without result... the javascript files are in the projectnamesrcappscancamerajsqrcodescanner  directory.

As I understand, for it to work correctly, I should put all needed libraries somewhere on filesystem assotiated with Wine, but the machine Ubuntu where the program is to be run will already have Java installed I did not wanted to oblige somebody to add additional libraries in Winedirectory.

Negative 2823 phow can I avoid abusive use of my REST API For example, I have a website where certain actions earn a bunch of points which are stored within a user account. So technically, when ever this action is performed, I call my REST endpoint to add the points to the user account. The action itself only happens within the website, therefore there is no way to check if the action has really happend from within the backend.p  pHow can I avoid that somebody uses the Javascript debugger to find the call and simply triggers it directly in order to emcheatem...  Is there some principle to avoid such kind of abusive usep  pEDIT Here is an example to narrow down the question E.g. we have an waiting queue where you can decrease your waiting period by tweeting about the page. The Twitter SDK has an callback method which fires when the user send the tweet. When this happens, the backend is called, e.g. api.somedomain.netuserxyz123hasTweeted1 or similar. p  pSo my question is, how to protect the last step call to api.somedomain.net, as somebody could lookup this REST url and trigger the call manually, without creating the tweet.p

Negative 2823 pI am brand new to Qt development and am trying to make a simple Hello, World with a togglebutton. I have something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzohFX.png altenter image description herep  pwith the corresponding codep  precodevoid MainWindowonpushButtontoggledbool checked      ifchecked          uigtlabelgtsetTextHello, World      else          uigtlabelgtsetText       codepre  pMy goal is to change the labels text either from blank to Hello, World or vice versa on a button click.p  pCurrently the label only stays blank. Earlier the default text was TextLabel, and on a buttonclick, it would change from TextLabel to blank, which is almost correct.p  pIve tried different options like codeonpushButtonclickedcode, but to no avail.p  pI know the solution is a simple one  can anyone point me in a good directionp
Negative 2823 pI try to make an interface for the device using WinForms. I have a class which stores all parameters and methods, like belowp  precode device.h  class Device       double parametera     double parameterb      double setParameterAdouble newvalue     double setParameterBdouble newvalue  codepre  pThen, I would create an instance and use its methods to modify parameters by event handling and return either corrected value for UI Control or just 0 if everything is fine. p  pHowever, I found that this solution doesnt really make my code shorter, as I still have to modify UI inside my Form document, where all my controls are reachable if errors  out of range values encountered.p  pWhat would I like to do is to somehow pass a kind of pointer to UI Control like TextBox to the function and make it like belowp  precodevoid setParameterAdouble newvalue, uictrlpointer        simple value check     if newvalue gt 0            numToMStr  function I have to convert numbers to managed string         uictrlpointergtText  numToMStrnewvalue          return       codepre  pand modify the control inside the setParameterA along with input control and setting my device. p  pstrong1. Is it possible to make such a thing in Cclistrong  if so, what would emuictrlpointerem look likebr 2. Is this a correct approach or should I stick to the basic solution, which would force me to check for function output to determine what to do with value set by user inside my UIp
Negative 2823 pI have a c app.p  pAt the moment I upload jpegs to my server to be rendered onto client browser to give the appearance of a video.p  pTo save on bandwidth I am considering whether I can convert these jpegs to H264 video format and provide a constant stream to my server.p  pI have seen example notably on this forum that will do this using ffmpeg. p  pHowever, the examples show that the video is created and THEN can be uploaded to my server.p  pThe only way I can see this working is to do continuous cut offs of say 15 seconds worth of footage and upload to my server.p  pIs there a better wayp  pADDITIONAL NOTES ABOUT MY APPLICATIONp  pThe main point of the application is to allow customers to view motion caught on their CCTV cameras  using IP cameras  via a web browser. These images HAVE to be MPJEG format.p  pThe other side of the application is that the customer also wants to see live streaming on the browser as well.p  pNormally, to do this with a high FPS rate and low bandwidth usage the H264 encoder is used.  But, H264 uses predictive encoding which cannot be used for motion stills.p  pThe live streaming I have at the moment is not bad.  But will never rival H264 either in FPS orand bandwidth.p  pSo, I wanted to see if I can have 2 streams going to my server. One would save motion stills to the hard drive and the other will display the live feed.p  pTo achieve this I would presume I would have to do this cut off at time chosen by me  like 15 seconds.p  pThe better option would be to never have a cut off but pipe the stream to my server.p  pFFMPEGServer seems to offer this but is not available for Windows OS.p  pI am unsure how to use FFMPEG to send a stream to my server and then receive it on my server C code.p

Negative 2823 pI am working on a static library project in Xcode.  It does some heavy processing and theres a lot of code to execute and I am ready to move away from the slowness of a Debug version.  Ive have been using the ProductBuild option until now, but when I changed to an AdHoc version using Edit Scheme and chose ProductArchive, I cannot find the new library built anywhere. Whenever I do this with an app the new build appears in my Organizer.p  pThe old libXXXX.a is there so it is clearly not overwriting that one. The build process succeeds compiles and links fine but nothing new appears anywhere.  Where is my library filep  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found a related Stack Overflow post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9149975iosstaticlibraryforadhocdistributionherea. It suggests choosing the Profile or Archive scheme to make sure the debugging code is stripped out.  Profile is disabled greyed out so I changed the Archive scheme to Release and tried it again with the same result no new file or anything anywhere.  I then noticed the ProductBuild For menu option and chose Running.  It did produce a new library file, but it is the exact same size as the the Debug version.  Not even 1K difference, so it does not seem to have done anything different.p

Negative 2823 pDear Netlogo community,p  pI want to put some timer constraint in my simulation for agents to make decision. I know we can implement by using ticks but in my simulation all agents should make decision with in a tick and to avoid any deadlock I want to introduce some time constraint for agent to make decision.

Negative 2823 pIs there any way or some unobvious workaround to make the Solution Explorer refresh automatically in emShow All Filesem mode when there are changes to the project directory tree Currently if I rebuild a project with different output settings which would add some files and remove some others, no changes would get reflected in Solution Explorer until I strongmanuallystrong click emrefreshem button.

Negative 2823 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comDaftMonkgeneratorangularfullstack relnofollowAngularJS FullStack generatora to create a small app. Now i would like to change it a little bit and being able to merge different accounts google, facebook, ecc in only one.p  pFrom what I understood i need to change the code in this wayp  precodeuse strict  var express  requireexpress var passport  requirepassport var auth  require..auth.service  var router  express.Router  router   .get, passport.authorizefacebook,      scope [email, useraboutme],     failureRedirect signup,     session true,     passReqToCallback true       .getcallback, passport.authorizefacebook,      failureRedirect signup,     session true,     passReqToCallback true   , auth.setTokenCookie  module.exports  router codepre  pOne of the difference is to use codepassport.authorizecode instead of codepassport.authenticatecode but I can not understand exactly why.p  pAnd another change is to add codeauthenticatecode that is supposed to add the user in the request. The point is that if first I execute the login with the local strategy, and after i try to connect my FB account, in the callback i can not find the req.user logged in.p  pIdeas p

Negative 2823 pI am working on a GUI application with Java and SWT.brI have createad a main window with a canvas in which I load an image well its a PDF page converted to image.brI have attached a PaintListener to the canvas and when i drag the mouse onte the canvas I am able to draw a rectangle.br When i release the left button on mouse, I want a dialog window to came out to fine setting the rectangle area, so I made a dialog with 4 spinner x, y, width and height.br Now I want to click on the spinners and the canvas redraw the changed rectangle area.brI tried to pass the canvas object to the dialog window and attach a second paint listener to it So I have one paintlistener from MainWindow.java and another from Dialog.java, but its no working.br The problem is that I have multiple rectangle drawn on the canvas, and if I call canvas.redraw from dialog window, the rectangles already drawn on canvas disappeared.brbrWhat is the best practise in such situationbr I thinks to put the dialog window in the toolbar, that is put the 4 spinners in the toolbar or another area in the main window so I have only one paint listener and get rid of the dialog, but I prefer the dialog cause it is impratical to drag a rectangle onto canvas and then move the mouse to click on toolbar.brbr Thanks in advance, Maurop

Negative 2823 pim switching from zoidcom to raknet, for now Im researching what I can do with it, and I cant find information on object relevance to connection, as far as I know I have to call codeRakPeerInterfaceReceivecode or codeReplicaManager3Updatecode and this will update all objects and send differences to all clients in clientserver setup. what if one player is far away from object and it doesnt need to receive updates on this object from server, is this possiblep  pSecond problem with raknet that I see is it stores pointers to all objects internally and when I call update which have to be called every game tick, it updates ALL objects, what if I have like thousands or millions of objects Will raknet enumerate all of them and call their callbacks or is there way to manually call update on objects I think are relevant Because I dont see the point of updating objects that are far away from all players, any way to combine this with some sort of quadtreep
