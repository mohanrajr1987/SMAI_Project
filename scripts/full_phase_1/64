Positive 64 pIs there an alternative way to register your device in your Developer account I have so much problems with using the normal way, that is PhoneReg.exe. First of all, after downloading many, many different versions of the Windows Phone SDK and trying them all, I dont even have the PhoneReg.exe executable itself, which means I had to download it from a site. I downloaded the PhoneReg.exe and the DLL which comes with it. And with that I cannot register my device, it keeps saying that it couldnt connect. I have a Lumia 930.p  pIve tried everything. Restrting the service, another USB cable, port, computer, it just doesnt work.p  pSo thats why Im asking here, is there a more simple alternative for this I really dont understand why even Apple, who has a lot more complicated way of using devices with profiles, etc. etc. is getting the job better done. Microsoft is really slacking, and with these kind of problems, Im really hesitant to support the platform, no wonder all these developers are not even bothering with the platform if it doesnt work.p

Positive 64 pI was testing out how the mic exactly works on my new HP 15 with Windows 10 laptop. Theres only one place where you can hook up headphones and can be used with a communication headset with the mic and all, nonUSB. I was fiddling around with the settings of the panels cause it was too quiet on the other end I was making a Skype call to my boyfriend and he said it was too quiet, the Windows panel and the panel of the soundcard driver. Its an Realtek driver and the panel for the Realtex driver is DTS Studio Sound. So, I hit this setting on the DTS panel and its called, Enable playback multistreaming and put it from disabled to enable, when I done that my laptop started to install another thing and created an extra speaker for a headset. So, I tried to get rid of what my laptop done by rollbacking the driver, that did not fix the problem, in fact I couldnt use my headphones at all when it was plugged in, I had to disable the main speakers in the Windows control panel not DTS so that I could use the headphones. My boyfriend could hear me better. But, I had a issue with the way the speakers were going and I no longer had the DTS panel. So, I updated the driver back to its Realtek driver. When I done that I had the DTS panel back. But, the issue was not fixed, when I hit the mic theres a button on the headphones it killed the whole Soundcard and my WiFi icon went insane, but came back. So, now I am stuck with what I did and no longer can use my headphones on my laptop. Is there anyway that I can reverse all this and put it back all to default without doing a whole system restore back to factory default I want to be able to make a Skype call without sounding so quiet, but I need to reverse it all back to before what I done to the laptop.        p

Positive 64 pIn Linux, we have the Root account, which is the highest possible privilege, and you can virtually do anything with that account. You can delete the entire OS with one command, and the kernel wont care. Windows on the other hand, is very complicated. An account belonging to the  Administrators group can only do so much. Even as admin, I cannot access certain files, or change certain parameters. Like browse a hidden folder in the hidden RECYCLE.BIN folder. I cannot delete certain files system32 stuff, and some dude who calls himself Trusted Installer owns most of MY OS. Is there a privilege level like root, thats higher than the Administrators group, that I can use to bypass all kernel level restrictions and ownership parameters I need to do certain things that require a privilege level thats through the roof. p

Negative 64 pI have a form served in nonUTF8 its actually in Windows1251. People, of course, post there any characters they like to. The browser helpfully converts the unpresentableinWindows1251 characters to html entities so I can still recognise them. For example, if user types an , I receive an codeamp8594code. Thats partially great, like, if I just echo it back, the browser will correctly display the  no matter what.p  pThe problem is, I actually do a htmlspecialchars  on the text before displaying it its a PHP function to convert special characters to HTML entities, e.g. amp becomes codeampampcode. My users sometimes type things like codeampmdashcode or codeampcopycode, and I want to display them as actual codeampmdashcode or codeampcopycode, not  and .p  pTheres no way for me to distinguish an  from codeamp8594code, because I get them both as codeamp8594code. And, since I htmlspecialchars  the text, emandem I also get a codeamp8594code for a  from browser, I echo back an codeampamp8594code which gets displayed as codeamp8594code in a browser. So the users input gets corrupted.p  pIs there a way to say Okay, I serve this form in Windows1251, but will emyouem please just send me the input in UTF8 and let me deal with it myselfp  pOh, I know that the good idea is to switch the whole software to UTF8, but that is just too much work, and I would be happy to get a quick fix for this. If this matters, the forms enctype is multipartformdata includes file uploader, so cannot use any other enctype. I use Apache and PHP. p  pThanks p

Negative 64 pI have an existing VS 2005 Std .NET Compact Framework application that I want to do some major refactorings on. Currently there is no unit testing in place, but I want to add this before messing with the code. I have no practical experience with unit testing, even though I know the theory just never got around actually implementing it I know shame on me  Here are some questions I am pondering at the momentp  pa As a beginner, should I use NUnit or NUnitLite which claims to be easier to usep  pb Should I aim for running the tests on the mobile device or on the desktop except for devicespecific code of course Currently the desktop looks more appealing, especially for including the tests in automated builds...p  pc How is the class that I want to test usually included in the test project My application is a .EXE file, i.e. I can not just reference it like a .DLL assembly from the test project or can I Never tried this .... I checked various NUnit tutorials but either found no mention of that, or one tutorial suggested to copy and paste the class that I want to test into the test project yuk. Should I link to the original source code file in my test project What about private methods, or dependencies on other classesp  pd Should I start modifying my original code to allow better testability, e.g. make private methods public, decouple etc. This is a bit like refactoring before being able to test, which does not sound good to me ... Or is it better practice to not touch the original code at all in the beginning, even if this means less code coverage etc.p  pe Should I look into any other tools or addons that most people usep  pThanks in advance for any answers I also appreciate answers if they are only to one or some of the above items.p

Negative 64 pI have a Form Compact Framework, actually with a few fields, a date and a string, among other things. Both TextBox controls are bound to properties in a BindindSource.p  pThe BindindSource has a DataSet as its DataSource property, and the DataMember is a table in a SQL CE database.p  pWhen I want to add a new row, I call bindingSource.AddNew, then bindingSource.MoveLast. The form shows the default values as defined in the DataSet and I can edit all the fields.p  pTo save the form, I call bindingSource.EndEdit and insert the values from the DataSet row into the database, using a TableAdapter method. The date makes it into the database, the string does not. Instead, the default value for the string is saved, not the value that I typed in the text box.p  pWhen I inspect the data in the DataSet tables row after calling EndEdit, the date field is updated with the data from the form, the string is not.p  pOddly enough, when I edit an existing row with the same form without calling AddNew, the string field is updated and persisted just fine. So this only happens after calling AddNew on the BindingSource. What am I missing Where should I start lookingp  pThe code is a bit too much to post here, unfortunately.p

Negative 64 pIf there were no visits to the dotnetnuke portal for some time, depending on the host, the dotnetnuke is unloaded from servers memory. The first visitor that comes next is then forced to wait about 15 seconds depending on servers speed in order to see the page. Dotnetnuke is a big framework but sometimes ends up serving low traffic sites also and that causes this unpleasant situation.p  pMy idea is to show the static index.html page which holds the html code from the default.aspx dotnetnuke page and execute XMLHttpRequest via javascript onLoad to get the default.aspx to start loading.p  pMy first page is a long sales letter and I would like the dotnetnuke to load in background while people read the sales letter and hopefully the page will be loaded when they decide to click a link or a menu item that links to some dotnetnuke page. If they click the link before it loads and are the first to visit the site they will still have to wait, but the ones that are there for the very first time and are reading the letter are the ones I dont want to loose over waiting for the site to come up.p  pSo every time when I modify the content on default.aspx I would need to create a new index.html page and overwrite the old one. I can do that with the same XMLHttpRequest in just a few lines of code.p  pSo, what do you thinkp  pSince Im not all that in web development or dotnetnuke I want your opinion andor your advice how people deal with this.p  pps. since my host doesnt let me to install dotnetnuke into a root folder I had an index.html page that redirected to dnnDefault.aspx  This way I can actually have the index.html page with all the content in my root folder and let the search engines take that page instead dnnDefault.aspx   and would not have to preform any automatic redirects.p  ppps.

Negative 64 pi am checking on the user status  whether he is active or idle  in a web page in a pop up window. in case he is idle for more than 30 minutes, the window will automatically close and reset some flags in the database.p  pi set cookies containing the timein the time he opens the popup window and check it against the current time every time the page refreshes or he navigates to another page still in the popup window. aside from the cookies, i also set the timein in the database in case the popup window isnt open, a cron job will take care of the resetting of flags by checking the timein in the database.p  pthere might be a case that he is typing something in the window and no page load occurs within 30 minutes so the window will automatically close and he will lose his work. so i added a function so that each emonkeydownem and emonclickem event, the  timein value in both the cookie and the database will be updated.p  palso, there can be more than one person who is using the system.p  pwill this consume too many resources im not familiar with stuff related to this issue. or is there a better way to do thisp  pthanksp
Negative 64 pIve got a jQuery UI dialog setup on a timer based on the session timeout.  p  pThe dialog pops two minutes before the actual session times out and gives the user a oneminute countdown in the dialog.  When the countdown runs out, it closes the dialog and redirects to the logout URL.p  pThis actually logs the user out one minute before session timeout, but it gives me some time to run a couple of other pieces to save the data they already entered.p  pThe issue is that in IE and Safari both PC and Mac, the user is pulled back to the browser tab that my system is on when the dialog pops.  If they have opened another tab to search google or something Id like for the dialog to pop, run the count down and redirect to the logout without pulling them from their other browser tab.  Not show over their current tab  just show in the background in case they happen to come back to my system.p  pAny thoughts on how to accomplish thisp  pThanksp

Negative 64 pIm just starting to get into JQuery so I apologize in advance if this is a simple question.p  pIm working with the a hrefhttpwww.alistapart.comarticlesprinttopreview relnofollowA List Apart article on Print Previewsa to try to get live Print Previews in the webapp that Im working on.  Ive gotten it to work satisfactorily but Im now trying to refactor my code to what I think it should look like internally.  I currently have 2 sets of methods, one for displaying the block of microcopy and the other for removing it.  Id much rather just have a single set that toggles the appropriate values of the elements in question.p  pFor the CSS that means disabling the nonprintpreview sheets and enabling the printpreview one, and viceversa.  For my microcopy, that means setting codedisplaycode to codeblockcode rather than codenonecode, again viceversa.p  pAt least for the the stylesheet links, I want to simply loop through the collection of related codelinkcode elements and set codedisabledcode to codedisabledcode but I cant figure out how to do that.  Im using jQuery but Im not opposed to dropping below that level of abstraction.p  pI assume once I know how to do that for the codelinkcode elements I should be able to extend the solution to also toggle the codedisplaycode attribute of the microcopy div.p  pHeres my current functions for the curiousp  precodefunction printPreview      link[relstyle][mediaprint.attrdisabled, true     link[relstyle][titleprint preview].attrdisabled, false     addPrintPreviewMicrocopy   function addPrintPreviewMicrocopy      div[idprintpreviewmicrocopy].cssdisplayblock   function normalView      link[relstyle][mediaprint.attrdisabled, false     link[relstyle][titleprint preview].attrdisabled, true     removePrintPreviewMicrocopy   function removePrintPreviewMicrocopy      div[idprintpreviewmicrocopy].cssdisplaynone  codepre  pThanks in advancep  phrp  pThanks everyone.

But whenever I want to instantiate Blocks from other threads, they appear to fall i.e. its properties update each loop, but they dont paint in the JFrame.p  pAs additional information, I am using NetBeans, and since the application entry point is on the JFrame class, the main method looks like thisp  precodepublic static void mainString args[]      java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable          public void run              new GtrisJFrame.setVisibletrue                 codepre  pI dont have that much experience with Java Threads, awt events and swing components. But something I read a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsjfctscarticlesthreadsthreads1.htmlsinglethreadrule relnofollowherea makes me think that my problem is that only one thread has the control over the swing components, or something... Is there any way to solve my problemp  pThanks in advance.p  pEDIT Additional info, whenever I check the method toString on the Instantiated cubes from threads, they give me this [,0,0,0x0], but when  I instantiate them within the same JFrame class they give me this result [,0,0,328x552] and they appear on the frame. this 328x552 value its the same as the components Dimension returned by getPreferredSize... I tried to force them to that dimension by instantiate them like this p  precodenew Blockthis, index.setPreferredSizenew Dimension328, 552 codepre  pBut it didnt work, anyone knows what this [,0,0,328x552] value could meanp  pThanks everyone, I think were almost therep  pEDIT 2 I realized that the Size of the component is x0 y0, why is this I change the BlockSpawners run method to something like thisp  precodepublic void run      whiletrue              System.out.printlnSPAWN         int index  Block.getRandomStartPosition         new Threadnew Blockframe, index.start         new Threadnew Blockframe, index1.start          try                      Thread.sleeptimeToSpawn                  catchInterruptedException e                      Unhandled exception                codepre  pOn the first run, everything goes ok even the pair of Blocks paint on the JFrame and fall down correctly, but after the Thread.sleep, the rest of them just get instantiated, but their getSize method gives me x0 y0 Is this still somehow related to the One Dispatcher Thread issue or its something different nowp

Negative 64 pIm writing detailed functional tests for my views to complement the unit tests on my models. Its a Django project and Im using the built in Django test framework with unittest. Obviously, one of the important things to check in these functional tests is that the permissions are set up correctly. With that in mind, Im attempting something like thisp  precodeanonclient  Client userclient  Client userclient.loginusernametestuser, passwordtest adminclient  Client adminclient.loginusernametestadmin, passwordtest  path  pathtomypage anonresponse  anonclient.getpath userresponse  userclient.getpath adminresponse  adminclient.getpath codepre  pI need to be able to confirm that the anonclient and userclient were both denied permission while the adminclient worked correctly. Howerver, I cant find a way to test that this has happened emrobustlyemp  pAt first I decided to check that the response was a 302 redirect because a side effect of failing the permission check is being redirected but this means it is impossible to tell the difference between functionality that automatically redirects the user and a failed permissions check. I cant just use self.assertRedirectsresponse, url because the target url can be overridden via the permissionrequired decorators loginurl parameter in the viewp  pPerhaps I should look into extending the userpassestest decorator so that it adds a property to the response object if the test fails This could then be checked for in the tests. Failing that I will have to determine whether the request was successful by checking if the requests sideeffects have happened. Doing it this way will work, but it will be extremely long winded, especially with a lot of these checks being done.p  pI cant imagine I am the first person to run into this issue, whats the right way to deal with this problem, or what have I missedp  pThanks very muchp

Negative 64 pIm working on an application that its been giving me some trouble, partly because of a function I made called codeNavigateAndWaitstring urlcode that navigates and then waits in a loop like thisp  precodewhileDocCompleted Application.DoEvents codepre  pcodeDocCompletedcode is a codeboolcode that changes to codetruecode whenever codeDocumentCompletedcode is called. I keep reading everywhere that using codeApplication.DoEventscode is in general a bad idea. And I also think it is. I was using it mainly as a temporary way of simplifying my code. The problem is that I assumed there would be another way to make a codeNavigateAndWaitcode function, and I made the whole program based on this assumption. So I came up with this way of simulating a codeNavigateAndWaitcode function without actually waiting using yield return.  This is just a sample application that illustrates the idea see codeGetcode in codeForm1code. So before I go ahead and change my whole code I would like to know your opinion.

Negative 64 pIm modeling a vector field in flash and spawning a mess of particles to visualize the flow of the field.

Negative 64 pCurrently I am developing a dynamic website using Dreamweaver cs5 with ColdFusion 9 and using Access to create my databases along with QuickBooks and QODBC to create database.p  pI have established a login session variable stemming from the login page. This session variable is being drawn from one Datasource Access Table Logininfo Field FullName but I wanted to create another session variable either at this point or further into the members page to use in a query sequence. This session variable would stem from another Datasoucre QBs Table Invoice Field CustomerRefFullName which is generated through Quickbooks and QODBC. I am not sure if this is possible but if it is how do I do it. I want to do this so I can query the Invoice database to upload the customers Invoices unique to them onto their page. So it would have to be related to their login credentials. If there is another better route to take I would greatly appreciate the advice. Below is the login code if there is additional information needed let me know. p  pThis is my current thinkingplan to do what I wish to intend hence the need to create the session variablep  pI have another Datasource QBs with a Table Invoice when I create another webpage for the customer to see their invoice I need to create a recordset that accesses that Table. In order to do so I think the best way would some home convert the session.FullName which came from Access Datasource, Logininfor Table into a session.CustomerRefFullName which would have to come from Datasource QBs Table Invoice Field CustomerRefFullName that way I could set the query WHERE CustomerRefFullName and have each logged in user see their specific Invoices. So is there a way to turn the session variable off one datasourcetable into a different sessionvariable off a new datasourcetable even if it is unique just to that pagep  pcodeltcfif IsDefinedFORM.usernamegt   ltcfset MMredirectLoginSuccessmemberspage.cfmgt   ltcfset MMredirectLoginFailedsorry.cfmgt   ltcfquery  nameMMrsUser datasourceAccessgt   SELECT FullName, Username,Password,AccessLevels FROM Logininfo WHERE Usernameltcfqueryparam valueFORM.username cfsqltypecfsqlclob maxlength50gt AND Passwordltcfqueryparam valueFORM.password cfsqltypecfsqlclob maxlength50gt   ltcfquerygt   ltcfif MMrsUser.RecordCount NEQ 0gt     ltcftrygt       ltcflock scopeSession timeout30 typeExclusivegt         ltcfset Session.MMUsernameFORM.usernamegt         ltcfset Session.MMUserAuthorizationMMrsUser.AccessLevels[1]gt         ltcfset Session.FullNameMMrsUser.FullName[1]gt       ltcflockgt       ltcfif IsDefinedURL.accessdenied AND falsegt         ltcfset MMredirectLoginSuccessURL.accessdeniedgt       ltcfifgt       ltcflocation urlMMredirectLoginSuccess addtokennogt       ltcfcatch typeLockgt         lt code for handling timeout of cflock gt       ltcfcatchgt     ltcftrygt   ltcfifgt   ltcflocation urlMMredirectLoginFailed addtokennogt   ltcfelsegt   ltcfset MMLoginActionCGI.SCRIPTNAMEgt   ltcfif CGI.QUERYSTRING NEQ gt     ltcfset MMLoginActionMMLoginAction amp  amp XMLFormatCGI.QUERYSTRINGgt   ltcfifgt ltcfifgtcodep

Negative 64 pI am running JSF 2.0p  pI currently have one java controller that is called Contacts.java. Inside there I have a list of addresses stored as a member variable p  precodeListltAddressesgt addresses codepre  pWhen my application loads it displays a bunch of contacts and you are able to click on a contact to open it to view its data. When you click on the contact the contactId is passed to a method that populates the List based on the contactId. It in turn then displays the data.p  pI also have a bunch of functionality that will add an address to the list, remove an address, updated etc. which are all dependent on this contactId.p  pI was considering splitting up my Contacts.java into two controllers Contacts.java and Addresses.java because there is just so much logic having to do with addresses that I figured it should be in its own class.p  pThe issue that I am struggling with is that if I move all of the logic dealing with Addresses into Addresses.java it will need to somehow have a reference to the contactId that was selected after compile time.p  pAt compile time Addresses will compile looking for the current contactId when it is populating the List addresses in the constructor. It will have not been set at this point though because the contactId is set when the user selects a contact in the application. p  pIs this a bad design idea  I am very new to Java and OOP and have not full grasped the concepts of how to break these apart. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 64 pThis is a generic question that applies to probably any highlevel programming language. Here is the situationp  pSuppose I have an array of strings. Say, I managed to put 500 000 strings from a short story into an array just suppose you dont have an option for input format. Consequently, there will most likely be an arbitrary number of duplicated items.p  pI want to take this array of strings and create another array that contains a unique subset of that array ie no duplicates. In this scenario, both the input and output must be arrays, so that may restrict you from various options.p  pPerformancewise, whats the fastest way to accomplish this Im currently using a linear search to check whether a word exists already, but as it is a linear search I feel that there might be faster ways especially if I have unreasonable amounts of strings to work with.

Negative 64 pIm working on a custom UITableViewCell subclass, where everything is drawn in code rather than using UILabels etc. This is part learning exercise and partly because drawing in code is much faster. I know that for a couple of labels it wouldnt make a huge difference, but eventually Ill want to generalise this to more complex cells.p  pCurrently Im struggling with the delete button animation how to animate the cell shrinking as the delete button slides in.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUbbcW.png altimagep  pFirstly, I am drawing in a custom subview of the cells contentView. Everything is drawn in that one subview.p  pI am setting the subviews size by catching layoutSubviews on the cell itself, and doingp  precode voidlayoutSubviews      [super layoutSubviews]     CGRect b  [self.contentView bounds]     [subcontentView setFrameb]      codepre  pIm doing this rather than just setting an autoresizing mask because it seemed more reliable in testing, but I can use the autoresizing mask approach in testing if needed.p  pNow, the default thing that happens when someone hits the minus is the view gets squished. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwnDTk.png altenter image description herep  pI can avoid that by, when setting up my cell, callingp  precodesubcontentView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeRedraw codepre  pThat gives me the correct end result my custom view redraws with the new size, and is laid out properly, like the first image I posted, but the animation of the transition is unpleasant it looks like the cell stretches and shrinks back to size.p  pI know why the animation is working like that Core Animation doesnt ask your view to redraw for each frame, it gets it to redraw for the end position of the animation and then interpolates to find the middle bits.p  pAnother solution is to dop  precodesubcontentView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeLeft codepre  pThat just draws the delete button over my cell, so it covers part of it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyYIH6.png altenter image description herep  pIf I also implementp  precode void didTransitionToStateUITableViewCellStateMaskstate      [self setNeedsDisplay]  codepre  pthen once the delete button has slid in the cell jumps to the correct size. That way theres no nice slidey animation, but at least I get the correct result at the end.p  pI guess I could run my own animation in parallel with the delete button appearing, temporarily creating another view with a copy of the image of my view in the old size, setting mine to the new size, and fading between them  that way there would be a nice cross fade instead of a sharp jump. Anyone use such a techniquep  pNow, you might ask why I cant use the codecontentStretchcode property and give it a region to resize. The problem with that is Im making something to be reasonably generic, so its not always going to be possible. In this particular example itd work, but a more complex cell may not.p  pSo, my question after all of this background is what do you do in this situation Does anyone have the animating delete button working for custom drawn cells If not, whats the best compromisep

Negative 64 pOn Facebooks iPhone app, the news feed refreshes every time the app becomes active. I would like to do something similar, but Im concerned about a race condition. The general bootstrapping of my app is as followsp  pstrongUIApplicationDelegatestrongp  precode voidapplicationDidFinishLaunchingUIApplicationapplication    [window addSubview[self.navigationController view]   [window makeKeyAndVisible]    voidapplicationDidBecomeActiveUIApplicationapplication    [rootViewController refresh]  codepre  pstrongRootViewControllerstrongp  precodepragma mark custom   voidrefresh    if self.newsFeedModel  nil     self.newsFeedModel  [[NewsFeedModel alloc] initWithDelegateself]      [self.newsFeedModel request]   pragma mark UIViewController   voidviewDidLoad     initialize the table    add subviews and whatnot   pragma mark NewsFeedDelegate   voidnewsFeedSucceededNSMutableArrayfeed     reload table view with new feed data  codepre  pAfter sprinkling codeNSLogcode everywhere, I determined the order of operations to bep  ol liapplicationDidFinishLaunchingli liapplicationDidBecomeActiveli lirefreshli liviewDidLoadli linewsFeedSucceededli ol  pNotice how refresh is called before the root view has been loaded. While were busy querying the server, the root view loads. When the server responds, the root view is populated with the feed. This works in most cases because the network operation takes a long time. However, if the network operation finishes faster than view can be loaded, then I will be attempting to construct the news feed before the view has been loaded. This would be bad. What is the best Cocoa Touch practice for solving this race condition I would just set a bunch of flags to determine what state were in and refresh the news feed depending on the state, but Im wondering if there were built in events in Cocoa Touch to handle this for me.p

Negative 64 pLater this year I will be producing a few expandable banners for a company. The banner is used to attract people and have them suggest candidates for a competition.p  pI suggested the option of possibly integrating an application form in the expandable banner, which after submission should land the user on the landing page of the site.p  pBut after I suggested this, I started thinking I cant recall having seen a form in an expandable banner for a long time. Because of this, I assume the use of forms in banners might be considered a big nono. If this assumption is correct I am trying to figure out why this is. I understand this will be partially offtopic, since the rationale might be in the realm of marketing, rather than programming. Still Id like to pose this threefold questionp  ol lipProgrammaticallybr Are there typical security or other concerns that keep professionals from using forms in banners Im thinking maybe csfr attacks, etc. here.pli lipUsabilitybr Is using a form in an expandable banner a typical nono from a usability perspective Im thinking maybe banners accidentally closing when filling out the form, or too little space to inform the user of the purpose of the form perhaps  pli lipLastly, marketing wise I understand that this category might be particularly off topicbr Is there any marketing aspect which advises against this route Im thinking have the user land on the landing page as soon as possible, perhapspli ol  pMaybe its a combination any of these categories Or maybe none at all. Im kind of trying to figure out whether my assumptions are correct, and why. Hopefully someone can shed a light on this matter from the perspective of any of the three categories.p
Negative 64 pI am looking for a way to link the number of rows in a form to items in a simple shopping cartcheckout script.p  pHere is the scenario.  Users are booking places at a conference.  There is a three tier pricing structure, and a section of the form for each price.  When the user first navigates to the booking page he is asked to add the number of people heshe wishes to book into the conference at each pricing structure.  Extra rows can be added to each section of the form using javascript.  Once the namesdetails of each person being booked in has been completed the user clicks on a Submit button which submits all of the information to a MySQL Database and redirects the user to a payment page.p  pI would like this payment page to consist of a simple shopping cartcheckout which is automatically filled with the number of people at each rate, with the total for each rate, and a grand total.  The user could then just click on a button to complete the PayPal payment.p  pSo the parts I am stuck on is how to automatically pass the information from the forms i.e. the number of rows people at each rate to the checkout page, and which script I might use to generate the checkout page.p  pId be grateful for any help to get this working,p  pThanks,p  pNickp

I use libraries called fl.controls and fl.events, and it worked perfectly fine, with buttons, textboxes, listboxes, combo boxes etc.p  pHelp me get my head around this issue. Is fl.controls and fl.events actually a part of flex, but I never realized this Or are they a competing widget libraryframework, but one that for marketing reasons Adobe did not bother assigning a sexy name like flexp  pIf flex is distinct from fl.controls and fl.events, can you use these libraries in a flex  AIR app I dont care about the flex aspect, just want to make AIR apps Or is it a matter of eitheror, either the fl. or the flex libraries in a single projectp  pAlso, for clarity, I am now working in FlashDevelop and not in any of Adobes proprietary IDEs.

Negative 64 pThe answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3559230doespushviewcontrollerretainthecontrollerherea all say that pushViewController retains the given viewController but they dont refer to a document that states this. p  pQuestion is how do they know that pushViewController will retain the given view controller Can we assume that this convention is adhered to by all other classes that take your NSObject derived object pointerp  h2Edith2  pI need a stronger argumentproof than what the currently presented answers propose. For example the documentation about a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIViewClassUIViewUIView.html relnofollowUIViewaddSubviewa clearly states This view is retained by the receiver. Alternatively, if you intend to show that the received controller is retained by implication because the UINavigationController has the same semantics as a collection class, then show that it does, by showing that it uses one of the collection classes internally or referencing some documentation that states this. The documentation for pushViewController says that the given view controller is placed on the navigation stack but nowhere does it say what class this stack is. In fact, looking at the definition in the header file of the UINavigationController, it looks like its not using a stack, but using NSMutableArray. If youve done a maths degree and written proofs then youll understand the sort of intellectual rigor Im looking for.  p

Negative 64 pI have the following scenario in my SharePoint 2007 project. I have timer job definition which each 30 minutes updates SharePoint list from the SQL database table.p  pI also have added item event handler for my list, so it does not allow users to add new items to the list from SharePoint user interface. In other words, new list items can be added only in timer job definition via SharePoint object model and it should not allow to add new item from UI.p  pMy problem is  Event handler is being executed even when it adds new item from timer job definition, can i somehow check in event handler how the item has been addedvia object model or via user interface.p  pMany Thanks, Hrayrp

Negative 64 pI have an application which has two Tabs. Both of these are ListFragments. The first Tab uses a CursorLoader to bind the data to the list, the data comes from a Service. The second Tab has nothing in it so far, its just a blank ListFragment.p  pNow, when I start up the application, and the service retrieves the information, all is good The ListFragment has its data populated and everything works great. When I switch to the second Tab, I can just see a Loading Wheel, which is fine.p  pThe issue comes when I switch back to the first Tab. When the service is started, and starts pulling down the data, I can see that its pulling it down in my logs, but nothing appears in my ListFragment. Its just blank, and its like the CursorLoader is not attached anymore.p  pThe next weird thing, is when I close the application and relaunch it, the data is suddenly there in the list But the bug again occurs when switching.p  pAny ideas on this Its really bugging mep
Negative 64 pI have a table with column type of datetime2 it was datetime, but EF as I see works with datetime2. I have set it as not null and with default value of codeSYSDATETIMEcode.

Negative 64 pI have a bug in my networking project which I have implemented using Java NIO sockets. The message format has message ID, content, message terminal EndChar. p  pThere are two issues that I need to addressp  ol limessage format for my protocol cf codecode belowli liparsing messages in context of NIO async callbacksli ol  pAs of now, the Message ID and The EndChar are two . At the beginning, I only use one  as end character, but the ascii94 which is conflict with msg ID 94. So I use two . The ending condition I use is that read character one by one, and only two  are met means the message is complete. But the bug is that two  might be split in one read because my read buffer size is 1KB and the socket buffer size default is 8 KB. p  pI havent figure out a solution to solve it. Can you give me some suggestions Thanks.p

Negative 64 pIm working with Android application developers. We need to recognize which APK package.apk is unsigned application package or signed application package. Also we would like to distinguish which signed APK package is signed by private key or signed by debug key. I know we could find these with Jarsigner tool.  But we cant figure out that way.  We have to find out with actual APK package.apk file which is generated by developers.p  pHere we found some clue. When we uncompressed the signed APK package then we found a folerMETAINF and three filesCERT.RSA, CERT, MANIFEST.MF.  When we open the CERT.RSA file with text editor, I could find the text, Android Debug in .apk was signed with the debug key.p  pSo here is our question,p  ol lipIf I find the specific text, Android Debug, then .apk is signed with the debug key.correct or incorrectpli lipIf I uncompressed .apk and there is no CERT.RSA.RSA, I guess some case the file name is differnt then .apk is unsigned. correct or incorrectpli ol  pThank you for reading my question.

Negative 64 pShould be a simple answer to my question, but on the web I seem to get conflicting information.p  pLets assume I have a simple API using Basic HTTP Authentication.

The default installation of codeluacode does not install the codelua.pccode file. That is because it is the normal package. However, the development package contains this file.

Negative 64 pAfter doing a lot of reading on the subject, I realized that many developers mix javascript and php in the same file by adding the .php extension or using other ways.p  pOn the other hand, if I choose to separate the javascript from the php and store it in an external cacheable static file, I gain some performance advantage, but I also need to find creative ways to pass serverside data to the javascript.p  pFor example, since I cant use a php foreach loop in the .js file I need to convert php arrays to json objects using jsonencode. In other cases, I need to declare gloabl javascript variables in the original php file so I can use them in the external js file. Since server side processing is considered faster than javascript, converting to js arrays and using global vars may also be a bad idea...p  pThe bottom line is Im trying to understand the trade off here. Which has more impact on performance, enable caching of js files or keeping a cleaner code by avoiding global js variables and multidemnsional js arraysp

Negative 64 pIm trying to find a way to keep track of files even when they are moved or renamed in the file system.p  pOne idea I had was to use the new UserDefinedFileAttributeView in Java 7 and create a custom file attribute as a sort of custom id. I thought that this might work on different platforms Windows and Mac primarily. But I cant get it to work. Even trying the example on this page  a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialiofileAttr.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialiofileAttr.htmla  When I get to this linep  pUserDefinedFileAttributeView view  Files.getFileAttributeViewfile, UserDefinedFileAttributeView.classp  pI only get a null value for the view variable, and then the program stops with a nullpointer exception.p  pI then found that there is a perhaps easier way to do this for Mac at least use the BasicFileAttributes fileKey attribute. I tried this, and the fileKey seems to stay the same even if I move the file or rename it. However, it also says that this functionality is platform dependent, and I remember reading somewhere that it doesnt work on Windows...p  pSo first of all, is the fileKey method a stable way of doing this on Mac And if so, what can I do for the same functionality for Windows Anyone know why I get null on the UserDefinedFileAttributeView Because if I could get that to work it should be crossplatform I guess.p  pThis is not something that needs to be super robust and scalable, it is just a small helper application Im developing, but it needs to be at least reliable in identifying files when moved or renamed...p

Negative 64 pI figured out a big problem with CADisplayLink.p  pI have the most basic EAGLLayer with OpenGL ES 1.1 drawing a rotating triangle for testing.

When coderotateGuncode fires, it creates a laser blast that I move away from the ship through a vector pointing down the gun barrel at its location when the method is called. This all works fine but I want to add random time intervals for each gun to fire since right now they appear to fire at the same time.p  pIve tried to create a time delay and fire off my rotateGun method using codeperformSelectorafterDelaycode, but this doesnt work. I then attempted to use the method codemainGunFirecode after a delay and then call coderotateGuncode on the main thread this also didnt work. By didnt work I mean that the NSLog I inserted just before my drawing calls within the coderotateGuncode method does print, but the guns and blasts are never drawn.p  pIf I simply do a performSelectorOnMainThread to call coderotateGuncode, then the guns and blasts are drawn as before and the blasts appear to fire at the same time.

Negative 64 pIve got a WPF application written in C.  It has to instantiate thousands of objects.  After pulling data from the database server,  it has to run a ton of calculations that takes time.  The whole process takes up to 2030 seconds with 80 of it coming from the calculations.p  pSo to help resolve this issue, I wrote a WCF service that keeps a copy of the already instantiated objects with the calcs already run, and then upon request, transfers the instantiated objects to the calling client.p  pIt works  However its slow...really slow.  Much slower than the original way.  It takes 34 minutes to transfer all the objects from the WCF service, thus defeating its purpose.  p  pIve tried streaming instead of buffering the service and increasing or decreasing the different service options in the client and server config files, but havent found settings that make a real difference yet.p  pIs this slow speed to be expected, or should it be fast and I just need to modify some options  If so, what optionsp

Negative 64 h2Using codeindexcode for a range scan and codeORDER BYcodeh2  pTo keep it simple I store birthday of users as a timestamp in column codebirthdatecode and have codetimestampregisteredcode, codetimestampupdatedcode and codetimestamplastlogincode that I want to use for codeORDER BYcode.p  pWhat Ive read is that mysql can use the full index in case of a range scan only if the range column is the last part of the index. The same for using the index to sort, the column for sorting has to be the last one. This is a contradiction if you need both.p  pThere seem to be workarounds to a range scan, e.g. using codeIN ...code, if not too many arguments are being used, or codeUNION SELECT...code p  pLinksbr   a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20060810usinguniontoimplementlooseindexscantomysql relnofollowhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20060810usinguniontoimplementlooseindexscantomysqla and br   a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20060814mysqlfollowuponunionforqueryoptimizationqueryprofiling relnofollowhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20060814mysqlfollowuponunionforqueryoptimizationqueryprofilingap  pHowever, those solutions using codeINcode or codeUNION SELECT...code wont work in my case, as the range of birthday for several years would lead to hundreds or thousands of arguments in codeINcode or codeUNION SELECTscode.p  pSo, no matter testing with 40.000 or 2 million users in the database, one query codeLIMIT 20code needs a few seconds. If I use codeindexcode for fast sorting, the filtering is slow. If the codeindexcode is used for filtering fast, the sorting is slow. Sure, as soon as more filtering applies e.g. having codecountrycode or any other arguments to apply, filtering will narrow the results and sorting becomes fast again.p  pHowever, there are sites facing the same issue out there and solving it fantastically... I wonder how What could be a solution for thisp  pAny hint or idea would highly be appreciated Thank you very much already in advancep

Negative 64 pIm rather confused about what my shaders are doing. I have a shader class which wraps the opengl parts of the shading for me.

Negative 64 pOk I have a draggable div reportBox1.  When I drag this div, its width is increased to about 3X its original width. Now this reportBox1 has a width of 29, but it seems that the expansion is getting inherited from two levels up, from the wrapper style.p  pThis is actually part of a much bigger page, but cutting code down to narrow down to the problem, I noticed that this problem only occurs when I have a strict DOCTYPE definition.  Below is the same code Im using. If I remove the DOCTYPE definition, the drag width problem is resolved.p  pNow I would like to keep this strict DOCTYPE definition since removing it for some reason IE9 will no longer display my round borders when using the style borderradius, but I guess this is another question.p  pNow this draggable width expansion problem occurs in both IE8 and IE9.

Negative 64 pI have a problem where im initialising a variable on the scope in a controller. Then it gets changed in another controller when a user logs in. This variable is used to control things such as the navigation bar and restricts access to parts of the site depending on the type of user, so its important that it holds its value. The problem with it is that the controller that initialises it, gets called again by angular some how and then resets the variable back to its initial value. p  pI assume this is not the correct way of declaring and initialising global variables, well its not really global, so my question is what is the correct way and is there any good examples around that work with the current version of angularp

Negative 64 pI have a domain model in which each line item is associated with a product.  The product has a list of options.  Each option is either required or optional.  The user can include an optional option which will add it to the line items selections list.p  pIn order to avoid redundancy, my first thought was to exclude required options from the line items selections list.  There are a lot of required options, so including them for every line item would lead to a bloated database.p  pThe problem is that the products can potentially change over time.  Options that were once required could become optional, and visaversa.  And entirely new options may be added to the product.  This creates a problem with my initial idea, since the meaning of line items selection lists would depend on a products options at the time of the order.p  pSo what should I dop  ol lipIf I also include required options in the line items selection lists, then the model is simple.  Id have a snapshot of the options that were included with the product.  But then Ive also got a lot of bloat in the database since references to required options will be repeated for every line item.  Is this something I should be worried about or will SQL Server do some kind of behindthescenes compressionpli lipShould I pursue my original idea of excluding required options from the line items selection lists  Then I would need to keep some historical data regarding changes to the products.  That way I could recreate the product and its options as they existed at the time of the order.  Sounds possible but more complicated than the first option.  I worry it would take more CPU cycles but that would be okay if its for old orders which wont be opened very often.  Ive never had to do this myself before, but maybe it wouldnt be so hard.  If this is the approach you recommend, please provide some pointers to design patterns, etc. to help me get started.pli ol

Negative 64 pMaybe its just me but almost everytime I import an Android project it does not compile.  First I need to set the Android SDK.  Thats reasonable. But then, I almost always need to reset the JDK. Usually from JDK 1.4 to JDK 1.6.  Now I really dont think too many people are out there developing android with JDK 1.4.  Perhaps they are, but its no where on my machine, and yet its often preselected on every Android project I import.  Its an annoying extra step, and I cannot imagine xCode doing something like this. Does anyone know why Eclipse does thisp  pNow some of these projects are not the most recent.  But what makes me think this is an eclipse issue is that often the error is that it wont compile because its not version 1.6  Which means that it must have been developed with the JDK 1.6.  Its usually an error involving Override that I see saying it cant be used without JDK 1.5 or 1.6.  I then check the JDK setting for the project and sure enough its at JDK 1.4.  Never 1.5, Never 1.3.p

Negative 64 pFrom what I can understand, countingtoinfinity occurs when one router feeds another old information, which continues to propagate through the network toward infinity. From what I read, this can definitely occur when a link is removed.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgZvbi.png altenter image description herep  pSo in this example, the BellmanFord algorithm will converge for each router, they will have entries for each other. R2 will know that it can get to R3 at a cost of 1, and R1 will know that it can get to R3 via R2 at a cost of 2. p  pIf the link between R2 and R3 is disconnected, then R2 will know that it can no longer get to R3 via that link and will remove it from its table. Before it can send any updates its possible that it will receive an update from R1 which will be advertising that it can get to R3 at a cost of 2. R2 can get to R1 at a cost of 1, so it will update a route to R3 via R1 at a cost of 3. R1 will then receive updates from R2 later and update its cost to 4. They will then go on feeding each other bad information toward infinity.p  pOne thing I have seen mentioned a few places is that there can be other causes of counting to infinity other than just a link going offline such as changing the cost of a link. I got to thinking about this and from what I can tell, it seems to me that perhaps the cost of a link being increased could cause the problem. However, I do not see that its possible for a lowering cost to cause the problem.p  pFor instance, in the example above, when the algorithm converges and R2 has a route to R3 at a cost of 1, and R1 has a route to R3 via R2 at a cost of 2. If the cost between R2 and R3 is increased to 5. Then this would cause the same problem, R2 could get an update from R1 advertising a cost of 2, and change its cost to 3 via R1, R1 then changing its route via R2 to a cost of 4 and so on. However, if the cost decreases on a converged route then it wouldnt cause a change. Is this correct It is an increasing cost between links that may cause the problem, not decreasing cost Are there any other possible causes Would taking a router offline be the same as a link going outp

Negative 64 pI am fairly new to Python and I am interested in listing duplicates within a list.

Looking for a push in the right directionp  pThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdjhNs.png altDesign thus farp

Negative 64 pLets say we have a sorted collection such as a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd412070.aspx relnofollowSortedSeta or a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.sortedlist.aspx relnofollowSortedLista with many 10M elements. Lots of querying is happening, so performance matters. From runtime comparisons, Im under the impression that LINQ to Objects doesnt take advantage of the sorting, therefore not taking advantage of potential performance gains.p  pFirst example  counting the elements in a rangep  precode        var mySortedSet1  new SortedSetltintgt          populate ...         int rangeCount  from n in mySortedSet1                           where n gt 1000000000 ampamp n lt 2000000000                           select n.Count codepre  pNot exactly sure what LINQ to Objects does here internally, worst case its checking every single element which would be On. The can be done a lot faster by taking advantage of the sorting with a binary search for the lower and upper bound in Olog n.p  pSecond example  SelectMany over list of setsp  precode        var myListOfSortedSets  new ListltSortedSetltintgtgt          populate...          var q  myListOfSortedSets.SelectManys gt s.OrderBys gt s         foreach var n in q                      Console.WriteLinen          codepre  pIf LINQ to strikeSQLstrike Objects were to take advantage of the sorting, it could effectively zippermerge all the sorted sets into one large sorted list in On. The .OrderBy on the result could then be ignored as the list is already sorted. p  pInstead, SelectMany concatenates all the sorted sets into one large now unsorted list which will required another On log n sort. This can easily be verified by removing the .OrderBy and observing the order in which the elements are written to the console.p  pMy question is strongis there already an alternative, more efficient implementation of LINQ to SortedSetSortedList out therestrong p  pa hrefhttpi4o.codeplex.com relnofollowi4oa looks very interesting, but it seems to require secondary index collections to improve query performance on the original collection.

Negative 64 pIm used to Visual Studio, where when you start typing codeSystem.Contextcode list will appear and you will be able to choose not only from type names that start with Context, but also from names like codeActivationContextcode.p  pThis gives me the ability to quickly find a method just by guessing its name. Especially important when Im beginning to learn to program for Android. For example, I was sure that codeListViewcode must have a method for setting codeListAdaptercode, but I was dumb enough not to figure it will be just codesetAdaptercode. In VS I would just type codeadaptercode and codesetAdaptercode would have appeared.p  pIs there something similar in Eclipsep

Negative 64 pI have several tables in my database A which are interconnected via foreign keys and contain values.

Negative 64 h3The problemh3  pMy moms a teacher. She recently asked me to write a script that takes a list of students and generates sets of student pairs. Each student should be paired with every other student and no student works with the same student more than once.p  pFor example, lets say she has four students codeBobcode, codeLisacode, codeDukecode and codeTyronecode. The script should produce the following outputp  precode  Bob, Lisa ,  Duke, Tyrone     Bob, Duke ,  Lisa, Tyrone     Bob, Tyrone ,  Lisa, Duke   codepre  h3Naive attempth3  pI thought this would be an easy project, but I realized halfway through coding it writing an efficient algorithm to generate the lists was a little bit beyond me. Originally, I wrote this naive implementation in Rubyp  precode the list of students CLASSLIST  A..H.toa   add an extra element to the class list if the class list length is odd CLASSLIST ltlt nil if CLASSLIST.length.odd   determine all possible permutations of the class lists permutations  CLASSLIST.permutation   convert all of the permutations into pairs permutations  permutations.map  permutation permutation.eachslice2.toa   puts PERMUTATIONS LENGTH   permutations.length.tos   iterate through the permutations and remove all subsequent permutations that contain a matching  pair i  0  while i lt permutations.length     remove any subsequent permutations that contain pairs already in the current permutation   permutations.deleteif do permutation       return true if the current permutation has any elements in common with the other permutation     permutations.indexpermutation gt i and permutations[i].any do p1        permutation.any do p2          p1[0]  p2[0] and p1[1]  p2[1] or p1[0]  p2[1] and p1[1]  p2[0]       end     end   end     increment i   i  1 end  permutations.each do permutation   p permutation end codepre  pThis implementation was horribly inefficient. When I profiled it, 4 students took 0.093 seconds, 6 students took 0.376 seconds and 8 students took 35 minutes and 32 seconds. Plus, the total number of permutations was unmanagable. 4 students has 24 permutations, 6 has 720 and 8 has 40320.p  pAsymptotically, the codewhilecode loop runs in On, the codedeleteifcode loop runs in On, the codepermutations.indexcode and codepermutations.anycode loops run in On and the inner codepermutation.anycode loop runs in On time, which menas strongthe entire algorithm runs in Onn3strong Clearly this solution isnt going to work.p  h3A better approachh3  pI realized early on that I didnt need to loop over every possible pair. Since every student works with every other student exactly once, unioning the result sets should result in every unique possible pair. I decided to start by generating this set. First I looked at every possible combination.p  precode     A    B    C    D    E    F A  A,A  A,B  A,C  A,D  A,E  A,F B  B,A  B,B  B,C  B,D  B,E  B,F C  C,A  C,B  C,C  C,D  C,E  C,F D  D,A  D,B  D,C  D,D  D,E  D,F E  E,A  E,B  E,C  E,D  E,E  E,F F  F,A  F,B  F,C  F,D  F,E  F,F codepre  pThen I removed the pairs where the students were working with themselves.p  precode     A    B    C    D    E    F A       A,B  A,C  A,D  A,E  A,F B  B,A       B,C  B,D  B,E  B,F C  C,A  C,B       C,D  C,E  C,F D  D,A  D,B  D,C       D,E  D,F E  E,A  E,B  E,C  E,D       E,F F  F,A  F,B  F,C  F,D  F,E      codepre  pFinally, I removed the duplicate pairs.p  precode     A    B    C    D    E    F A       A,B  A,C  A,D  A,E  A,F B            B,C  B,D  B,E  B,F C                 C,D  C,E  C,F D                      D,E  D,F E                           E,F F                               codepre  pGenerating the pairs was fairly trivial in Ruby.p  precode generate the set of all possible pairs UNIQUEPAIRS  0..CLASSLIST.length  2.toa.map do row   row  1..CLASSLIST.length  1.toa.map do column     [ row, column ]   end end.flatten1 codepre  pNext I tried to figure out how to turn these unique pairs into the result sets I was looking for. My idea was to create a set of all of the possible pairs for each list, and then eliminate the pairs that couldnt be used as pairs were added to each list.

Negative 64 pIm really after the screen config qualifiers that would be picked when the screen is wide enough for the split action bar to not split. p
Negative 64 pSome of the tables in my web application can be reordered with drag and drop, using this codep  pa hrefhttpisocra.com200707dragginganddroppingtablerowsinjavascript relnofollowhttpisocra.com200707dragginganddroppingtablerowsinjavascriptap  pThis uses the standard JavaScript insertBefore method to move a table to a different DOM position, like thisp  precodedragObject.parentNode.insertBeforedragObject, currentRow.nextSibling codepre  pIt works fine, but the movement seems abrupt. I would like to update this so that as I drag a table row, the other rows animate to their new positions. This is the same effect that iOS has when you drag a table row in an editable table.p  pI thought this could be a job for jQuery, so I tweaked the code to change the standard insertBefore methods to jQuerys insertBefore functions, which I thought I could then animatep  precodejQuery.dragging.insertBeforecurrentRow.nextSibling codepre  pBut after playing with different animation options I realized that they could only animate the row thats moving, not the other rows around it.p  pHas anyone seen a solution for this  basically simulating the iOS table reordering in HTML I would prefer a solution that works with my existing table rows so I dont have to completely change my code, but Ill consider changing to a divbased markup if necessary.p
Negative 64 pI have a codeJButtoncode which I have set a custom icon on. Now I want it to display another icon ontop of the one that is already displayed when I drag my mouse cursor over it but I cant figure out how to do it because if I use codebutton.setIconiconcode it will replace the icon that already is displayed. How would I do this in an as easy way as possiblep
Negative 64 pSo I have an app with a custom AlertDialog that has an Ok and Cancel button, and an EditText Object. When I click on the Name of Workout button, the AlertDialog and the soft Keyboard open.

I am opening Firefox using ShellExecute and sending the keystrokes Alt  h and a to the open Firefox window using sendInput.

It was quite many. And the change of the codeEmptycode reference seemed to persist for the complete life of the application. Now, the other day I tried to repeat that little stunt, but then using a .NET 4.5 machine, and I couldnt do it anymore.p  pNB If you have .NET 4.5 on your machine, probably your codePowerShellcode still uses an older version of .NET, so try copypasting code[String].GetFieldEmpty.SetValuenull, Hello worldcode into PowerShell to see some effects of changing this reference.p  pWhen I tried to search for a reason for this, I stumbled upon the interesting thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11873798What39s the cause of this FatalExecutionEngineError in .NET 4.5 betaa. In the accepted answer to that question, is it noted that through version 4.0, codeSystem.Stringcode had a static constructor code.cctorcode in which the field codeEmptycode was set in the C source, that would probably just be a field initializer, of course, while in 4.5 no static constructor exists. In both versions, the field itself looks the samep  precode.field public static initonly string Empty codepre  pas seen with IL DASM.p  pNo other fields than codeStringEmptycode seems to be affected. As an example, I experimented with codeSystem.Diagnostics.DebuggerDefaultCategorycode. This case seems analogous A sealed class containing a codestatic readonlycode codestatic initonlycode field of type codestringcode. But in this case it works fine to change the value reference through reflection.p  pstrongBack to the questionstrongp  pHow is it possible, technically, that codeEmptycode doesnt seem to change in 4.5 when I set the field I have verified that the C compiler does not cheat with the read, it outputs IL likep  precodeldsfld     string [mscorlib]System.StringEmpty codepre  pso the actual field ought to be read.p  hr  pstrongEdit after bounty was put on my questionstrong Note that the write operation which needs reflection for sure, since the field is codereadonlycode a.k.a. codeinitonlycode in the IL actually works as expected. It is the strongemreademstrong operation which is anomalous. If you read with reflection, as in codetypeofstring.GetFieldEmpty.GetValuenullcode, everything is normal i.e. the change of value is seen. See comments below.p  pSo the better question is Why does this new version of the framework cheat when it reads this particular fieldp

Negative 64 pAs the tite suggests, Im trying to find an equation for the luminosity of a color in terms of its corresponding Red, Green and Blue components in the Windows program Paint. Ultimately, Im using the equation in a sort of the thought experiment. If I had a screen with say a million pixels, I can find the percentage of pixels that would have to be red, green and blue to make a desired color with a neutral luminosity value of 120 purely the color I choose, no black or white in it. However, if I wanted to make the color a bit darker luminosity less than 120, I would not only need pure red, green and blue in it but also black. I just cant figure out how i would go about finding the percentage of pixels that would have to be black to make the desired color. If I wanted to make brown for example 2 red pixels for every green one and no blue pixels, I would have to make a percentage of the pixels black to darken the orange color  to brown. Some data I have collectedp  pLuminosityPercent Black 1200 7010 6020 4050 0100p  pSorry for the really confusing post, I just cant figure it out p

Negative 64 pFor simplicitys sake, these code snippets will be shortened. The purpose of this is to take a GET parameter, set it on the session, and redirect back to the GET with the url parameter removed. Basically, URI cleanup. If theres a bettersimpler way to do this, I would be glad to hear it.p  pI have a controller defined as suchp  precodeController RequestMappingpathpage.xhtml ScopeBeanDefinition.SCOPEPROTOTYPE SessionAttributes myParam1, myParam2  public class MyController     RequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.GET, params   urlParam2    public String handleUriParamRequestParamvalue  urlParam2, required  false                                final Long urlParam2,                                final RedirectAttributes redirs       at this point, myParam1 is set on the session.      now set the param as a flash attrib with the name of the session variable     redirs.addFlashAttributemyParam2, urlParam2     return redirectpathpage.xhtml       RequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.GET, params     public String doGetStuffModelMap model       do stuff using myParam1 and myParam2.      problem is, myParam2 is on the session, but myParam1 is not      codepre  pLike the code says, somehow codemyParam1code is being unset when the redirect happens. I can fix this by passing a codeModelMapcode to the codehandleUrlParamcode method and manually adding codemyParam1code to the flash attributes, but that seems to defeat the purpose in my mind.p  pWhy is the codeSessionAttributecode codemyParam1code being removed after the redirectp  pIs there a better way to pull parameters off the URI and put them on the sessionp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo it seems that whenever you use codeRedirectAttributescode at all, you must make sure you put any codeSessionAttributecodes you want to carry into the redirect on the FlashAttributes or else they will be lost. I imagine this happens because codeSessionAttributecodes are pulled off the codeModelMapcode which is replaced by FlashAttributes when used. Is this a bug in Spring or intentional behavior If its intentional, can someone explain why I thought codeSessionAttributecodes were meant to stay on until removed by completion of the conversational session.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1371392whendosessionattributesinspringmvcgetremovedwithcodesampleSimilar StackOverflow post herea.p  pstrongAddendumstrongp  pIn light of the accepted answer provided, I am still stumped as to how I can clear the URI parameters while putting them on the users session. One option I have considered is to create a wrapper for the semiprimitive objects java.lang.Integer, java.lang.String I am trying to store because they will not be placed on the URI string, but this seems hacky to me. If anyone has a better way to accept GET parameters, store them on the users session, and clear those from the users address bar which will require a redirect, I will gladly use it.p

It means that the list of points to draw isnt ordered i.e. the point which has the smallest abscissa isnt the first point in the codedoublecode.p  pCould it be the source of the problem  How can I fix that and just draw a curve and not a polygon p
Negative 64 pI have an xml column called OrderXML in an Orders table... their is an XML XPath like this in the table...   p  precodeOrderInternalInformationInternalOrderBreakoutInternalOrderHeaderInternalOrderDetailsInternalOrderDetail codepre  pThere InternalOrderDetails contains many InternalOrderDetail nodes like this...  p  precodeltInternalOrderDetailsgt   ltInternalOrderDetailgt     ltItemNumbergtFBL11REFBKltItemNumbergt     ltCountOfNumbergt10ltCountOfNumbergt     ltPriceLevelgtFREEltPriceLevelgt   ltInternalOrderDetailgt   ltInternalOrderDetailgt     ltItemNumbergtFCL13COTRGUIDltItemNumbergt     ltCountOfNumbergt2ltCountOfNumbergt     ltPriceLevelgtNONFREEltPriceLevelgt   ltInternalOrderDetailgt ltInternalOrderDetailsgt codepre  pMy end goal is to modify the XML in the OrderXML column IF the ItemNumber of the node contains COTRGUID like COTRGUID AND the PriceLevelNONFREE.  If that condition is met I want to change the PriceLevel column to equal FREE.p  pI am having trouble with both creating the xpath expression that finds the correct nodes using OrderXML.value or OrderXML.exist functions and updating the XML using the OrderXML.modify function.  p  pI have tried the following for the where clause...  p  precodeWHERE OrderXML.valueOrderInternalInformationInternalOrderBreakoutInternalOrderHeaderInternalOrderDetailsInternalOrderDetailItemNumbernode[1],nvarchar64 like 13COTRGUID codepre  pThat does work...but it seems to me that I need to ALSO include my second condition PriceLevelNONFREE in the same where clause and I cannot figure out how to do it.  Perhaps I can put in an AND for the second condition like this...  p  precodeAND OrderXML.valueOrderInternalInformationInternalOrderBreakoutInternalOrderHeaderInternalOrderDetailsInternalOrderDetailPriceLevelnode[1],nvarchar64  NONFREE codepre  pbut I am afraid it will end up operating like an OR since it is an XML query.  p  pOnce I get the WHERE clause right I will update the column using a SET like this...  p  precodeUPDATE Orders SET orderXml.modifyreplace value of OrderInternalInformationInternalOrderBreakoutInternalOrderHeaderInternalOrderDetailsInternalOrderDetailPriceLevel[1]text[1] with NONFREE codepre  pHowever, I ran this statement on some test data and none of the XML columns where updated even though it said zz rows effected.p  pI have been at this for several hours to no avail.

Negative 64 pWith boost python, I was adding an attribute to my python wrapper where the value came from an enumerated type, for instancep  precodescope.attrmyconstantsomenamespacesomeclasssomeenumvalue codepre  pBut I got a run time error when I imported my python modulep  precodeterminate called after throwing an instance of boostpythonerroralreadyset codepre  pFollowing other threads, I put the above in a trycatch but didnt catch anything to call PyErrFetch on.  Im still curious where the original python error occurred.p  pIt turns out that I have to dop  precodescope.attrmyconstantintsomenamespacesomeclasssomeenumvalue codepre  pAnd then it runs.  p  pAnother, but I think related problem, is if you export a C function in your python wrapper that returns a C enum, but you do not export that enum, all is fine until you call this function from python.  Then boost generates a python exception about a type not being found.p  pSo clearly boost is doing some things at runtime that seem to me like they should be done at compile time.  Both these problems were time consuming to diagnose.  Does anyone know what is going on  With more things happening at runtime then Id expect, will I hit performance issues with boost python that I wouldnt get if I worked directly with the python extension API  In addition to performance, Im concerned that boost python code has more errors that wont be found until runtime then direct python extension code would have.  p  pOn the flip side, is there some big gain to be had with all this dynamic type binding  Clearly there is the nice boost interface for writing my own python extension  but does all this dynamic binding make it easier to add new boost python wrappers into an existing system then wrappers written directly with the python extension APIp

Should it be able to work with REGEX Should I be taking an entirely different approach  Is this too big a task for someone who doesnt know a whole lot about html, and web development more broadly   I thought it would be a simple project, but it just doesnt seem to be.  p

Negative 64 pI am creating a Rails application that integrates a live streaming music player. Basically, I want to create a media player that acts a bit like a radio  anyone who accesses the page containing the media player should hear the current song from a dynamically generated playlist. Users should be al lowed songs to submit songs into the playlist, and the back end will search for the song by calling the API from some third party music library like Spotify to retrieve it. Ive seen some of the media player solutions available done in Haxe but they all use Flash, which is not ideal since I plan on integrating this application with iPhones. My question is, are there any reliable third party solutions that dont use Flash, and how would I go about integrating this as part of my Rails application p
Negative 64 pWhat is the differences between codeGotFocuscode and codeGotKeyboardFocuscode and similarly codeLostFocuscode and codeLostKeyboardFocuscode p  pSorry for the simple question, but, I googled it and read a lot of blog posts, but Im still confused. It seems nobody knows exactly what is the difference p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pMy usagep  pI am creating a custom control by extending codeControlcode class. Something like codeComboBoxcode but with some other effects. Im trying to open and close a codePopupcode by setting a property codeIsDropDownOpencode just like a codeComboBoxcode through the codeGotFocuscode and codeLostFocuscode events. I dont want to codePopupcode get closed, when I codeAltTabcodeed the windows, but get closed when I click on a codeButtoncode for example or I go to a codeTextBoxcode. I didp  precodeprivate static void OnGotFocusHandlerobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      if e.Handled         return     SearchBoxsender.IsDropDownOpen  true     e.Handled  true   private static void OnLostFocusHandlerobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      if e.Handled         return     SearchBoxsender.IsDropDownOpen  false     e.Handled  true  codepre  pThe codeGotFocuscode works. But the codeLostcode one didnt. If I do the codeLostcode stuff in codeLostKeyboardFocuscode then when I codeAltTabcode the windows, or codeWindowcode goes to inactive, then the method get called, while I dont want. How can I solve it p

Negative 64 pIve built a two dimension array with string values. There are always 12 columns but the number of rows vary. Now Id like to build a string of each row but when I run the following codep  precodeoutstring   for i0 i lt ctrLASTROW  1 i      for k0 k lt 12 k        datastring  DATATABLE[i][k]        outstring . datastring       codepre  pcodeoutstringcode takes the first value. Then on the second inner loop and subsequent loops the value in codeoutstringcode gets overlaid. For example the first value is codeDATEcode then the next time when the value codeABCcode gets fed to it. Rather than being the hoped for codeDATEABCcode its codeABCEcode. The codeEcode is the fourth character of codeDATEcode. I figure Im missing the scalar  list issue but Ive tried who knows how many variations to no avail. When I first started I tried the concatenation directly from the codeDATATABLEcode. Same problem. Only quicker.p

Modules add the missing functions  So I discovered that if I export my project with the option Copy required libraries into a subfolder next to the generated JAR it works just as it does in the IDE. Now, As this is at least a temporary solution to get my project running, I would still like to know how to compile as normal without getting the problem. 58 modules loaded inside the IDE, Only 2 loaded when compiled.p

I cannot optimize this three functions out, nor calculate both sine and cosine in one pass there interdependent, but I dont need too accurate results for my simulation, so I can live with faster approximation.p  pSo, the question What are the fastest way to calculate sine, cosine and square root for float in Cp  pstrongEDITstrong Lookup table are more painful as resulting Cache Miss is way more costly on modern CPU than Tylor Series. The CPUs are just so fast these days, and cache is not.p  pI made a mistake, I though that I need to calculate several factorials for Tyler Series, and I see now they can be implemented as constants.p  pSo updating question is there any speedy optimization for square root as wellp  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pI am using square root to calculate distance, not normalization  cant use fast inverse square root algorithm as pointed in comment a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFastinversesquareroothttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFastinversesquarerootap  pstrongEDIT3strongp  pI cannot also operate on squared distances, I need exact distance for calculationsp

Negative 64 pI have a emvirtualem DataGridView DGV with Vertical ScrollBar enabled. The DGV is ReadOnly. The event codeCellValueNeededcode is correctly handled. At beginning, the row count is less than what can be displayed and the scrollbar is not drawn. That is correct. p  pIn a second thread Thread... Start I add new rows. Still in this thread, I update codeDGVgtRowCountcode according to the total number of row and call codeDGVgtInvalidate true code with the hope that the scroll bar will be drawn if necessary.p  pThen I observe a strange behaviour while codeCellValueNeededcode is still correctly called, the emareaem of the scrollbar is not invalidated. It appears as a not redrawn zone. If I minimize the form then restore it, the scrollbar appears as a black rectangle. It is like if the scroll bar itself had codeVisiblefalsecode.p  pI even tried to put the codeDGVgtRowCountcode between a codeDGVgtScrollBarsScrollBarsNonecode and a codeDGVgtScrollBarsScrollBarsVerticalcode then between a codeDGVgtSuspendLayoutcode and a codeDGVgtResumeLayoutcode but the behaviour remains the same for the two tries.p  pMany questionsp  ol liIs codeDGVgtRowCountcode update processed correctly I do it in the second thread, not in the Main thread because I naively believe that the DGV being purely ReadOnly, it wont cause any conflict. Maybe Im wrongli liIs the Invalidate called also in the second thread because it only adds a message in the queue, no sufficient to make the scroll bar appearli ol  pI saw a couple of message on the Web about difficulties with the DataGridView scrollbars.

In v2, the application read in xml data every 5 seconds, cleared markers, then new markers were created and placed on the map. The ability to clear the map overlay using strongmap.clearOverlaysstrong no longer exists in v3. The suggested solution is to keep track of the old markers, then remove them. Clearing the markers in a loop prior to creating new markers is easy to do, and works. Except for the fact that the markers blink when replaced more often than not. This is very distracting, and highly undesirable since this did not happen in v2.p  pI decided that I should compare the new marker data to the old marker data. If the location and icon color stayed the same, both old and new markers are basically ignored. For the sake of clarity, the icon color signifies a status of the vehicle represented by the icon. In this case the application is to track ambulance activity, so green would be available, blue would be enroute, etc.p  pThe code handles the checking of the new and old markers fine, but for some reason, it will never remove the old marker when a marker unit moves. I saw suggestions about strongsetMapstrong being asynchronous. I also saw suggestions about the arrays not being stronggoogle.maps.Markerstrong objects. I believe that my code handles each of these issues correctly, however the old markers are still never removed.p  pIve also made sure that my marker arrays are global variables. I am also using the variable strongsidebarhtmlstrong to display information about which markers were supposed to be removed, and which markers were supposed to be added.

Negative 64 pIm going to be adding the ability to remove ads from a free app that I currently have on the App Store.

Negative 64 pim working on an app, that displays largearound 2000x2000px bitmap in imageview. This image has to be that large since user can pinch to zoom it in order to see some details. App has to be able to draw circles on that image, and also to display image alone, without circles on it. I was using 2 layers but the problem is memory since 2k x 2k px is around 16mb of memory, and creating another bitmapanother 16mb, just to draw a few circles, is pointless in my opinion. Is there any way, that you can draw simple primitives on image, and also be able to display it without primitivescircles in my case  Maybe somehow to store only modified pixels or sth Thanksp

Negative 64 pI have several domain classes for which the user interface includes a duplicate command. As part of the implementation of those commands, I have implemented codeclonecode methods in the corresponding domain classes.p  pI have been trying to correct my bad habit of improperly implementing clone in general based on use of codenewcode rather than codesuper.clone,code so as soon as I thought about doing the same for my Grails domain classes, I wondered how using codesuper.clonecode to obtain a clone might interact with codeGORMcode  Hibernate persistence. In particular, I was wondering about the proper way to handle the implicit id property. If I simply codesuper.clonecode, do nothing further and later try to codesavecode the cloned instance, will it work properly creating a new persistence entry or will some kind of error or silent failure resultp  pWhat is the proper or preferred way to duplicate a Grails domain instancep

Negative 64 pIm fairly new in dealing with capistrano, learning on an inherited project.p  pIve done quite a few deployments on my staging server and never had a problem with the deployment dropping my CSS or JS changes in the compiled asset files.p  pI recently performed some major UI updates, upgrading gems for bootstrap, jquery, font awesome and others, along with major changes in my applicaiton CS and JS files.  When I deploy with capistrano on my staging server it ignores ALL of my asset changes and compiles the application JS and CSS files using old versions of the asset.  It does actually create new files, it just uses old copies of everything.  I dont see any errors when I deploy but it seems obvious that somethings going wrong.p  pEverything works fine in development, of course, and if I run an assetsprecompile locally I get all the updated CSS and JS files included.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 64 pI am a noob with Cython and C, so I have a question on argument passing. I want to avoid passing a copy of an argument in the following scenariop  precode somefile.pyx distutils language  c from libcpp.vector cimport vector  def addonevector[int] vect     cdef int i     n  vect.size     for i in rangen         vect[i]  1  cdef vector[int] v for i in range100000     v.pushbacki addonev  lt  codepre  pI want the method codeaddonecode to just modify codevcode inplace. I believe in C, you can achieve this by prepending the argument with codeampcode, which means that any changes to the pointer is passed to the pointee. That way, you dont have to worry about passing a pointer or the actual object, i.e.p  precodeaddonev  in c codepre  pCan I do the same in Cython, or do I have to explicitly change the arg type to a reference instead, i.e. codedef addonevector[int] vectcodep

Negative 64 pI have a couple of classes, one of which needs to count how many times object has been created int fields called lastId.

What about java Where do I have to initialize static fields value. Also, I know how to count if object has been created, but what about if object has been deleted There are no destructors in java, so how can this job be donep

Negative 64 pHow do I read in lines from a file and assign specific segments of that line to the information in structs And how can I stop at a blank line, then continue again until end of file is reachedp  pBackground I am building a program that will take an input file, read in information, and use double hashing for that information to be put in the correct index of the hashtable.p  pSuppose I have the structp  precodestruct Data      string city     string state     string zipCode  codepre  pBut the lines in the file are in the following formatp  precode20  85086,Phoenix,Arizona 56065,Minneapolis,Minnesota  85281 56065 codepre  pSorry but I still cannot seem to figure this out. I am having a really hard time reading in the file. The first line is basically the size of the hash table to be constructed. The next blank line should be ignored. Then the next two lines are information that should go into the struct and be hashed into the hash table. Then another blank line should be ignored. And finally, the last two lines are input that need to be matched to see if they exist in the hash table or not. So in this case, 85281 is not found. While 56065 is found. p

Negative 64 pIm trying to build a simple viewing application using Oracle APEX 4.1.1. The info to be displayed is in a table on a different database then the database containing the schema the APEX application accesses. This remote table is accessed using a View emRemoteTableViewem and a Database Link. The View works as expected, including Oracles disability to Select a LOB column item through a Database Link.p  pIn the APEX application I have defined a Procedure emDownloadFilesem that is run whenever a BLOB from the View is required to be downloaded, according to the instructions in the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE1437301appdev.32e13363updnfiles.htmCJACBEHG relnofollowOracle Application Express Advanced Tutorialsap  pThis works perfect when the APEX application is build on an existing table containing BLOB items, no problem there.p  pHowever, on the emRemoteTableViewem the process differs slightly. Additional lines of code are added to the emDownloadFilesem Procedure that, whenever an item in the view is called to be downloaded, Insert the actual BLOB from emRemoteTableViewem into a Temporary Table emTempTableem. emDownloadFileem is then called on emTempTableem to download the now locally stored BLOB. This is all done to circumvent the direct Selection on LOB items through a DBLink. There is no COMMIT.p  pUnfortunately, the APEX applications fails whenever the item is called to download with a This webpage is not found. No webpage was found for the web address ...fp10171342995827199601NOP7DOCID3001.p  pResearch into this problem has proven fruitless. The Insert Procedure is working as expected in PLSQL Developer and any other BLOB in any other local table can be downloaded easily.p  pThus the question is, why cant the APEX application handle this situation. Are there limitations when working with temporary tables or insert statements that I should be aware of Also, what are the best practices for downloading a LOB object.p  pTo elaborate on the procedure to Insert the rows and Download the BLOB.

I could probably use reflection to get the desired results, but that would be unwieldy and not very efficient, especially considering this method could be called a lot in a particular process.p  pSo does anyone have any suggestionsp
Negative 64 pI am new in Android. I have followed some tutorials about ContentProviders and Loaders. I have created a Notepad application, but I think it fails to save the content into database. I have two activities NoteList with the list of notes and NoteEdit where the notes are created, and one ContentProvider NotesDbAdapter.

Negative 64 pIm curious how you handle extensions to a protocol UVC. Lets say we have an APB UVC that implements the AMBA protocol. Lets also say that we have a DUT that, aside from the signals defined in the specification, also implements a few other signals that are related to the generic APB signals they add support for protected accesses or whatever. On the class side its pretty easy to handle just create a new sequence item subclass with extra fields and do type overrides. Where it gets tricky is when working at the signal level. Our UVC already uses an SV interface that only contains the APB signals and its not possible to extend it in any way. How would we get these extra signals into the UVC to drive and monitorp  pWhat we have done up to now is, since we use our own homegrown UVCs, we just pack everything into the base UVC and have it highly configurable. I dont like this approach as I dont feel its properly encapsulated. It confuses the user with too many extra config parameters and it makes development a lot harder. Im just wondering if anyone has a nicer solution to this.p  pThis is a question I also asked on the Accellera UVM forums a hrefhttpforums.accellera.orgtopic1832handlingprotocolextensions relnofollowhttpforums.accellera.orgtopic1832handlingprotocolextensionsap

Negative 64 pI am using Spring Security 3.2.3 in my Spring MVC application and getting some unexpected behavior. p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringsecuritysitedocs3.2.0.CISNAPSHOTreferencehtmlcsrf.html relnofollowdocumentation herea, it should be possible to use codecsrf.tokencode in the meta tags of my htmlp  precodeltmeta namecsrf contentcsrf.token gt lt default header name is XCSRFTOKEN gt ltmeta namecsrfheader contentcsrf.headerName gt codepre  pFrom where I extract the value of content using JQuery and place it into the Request Header using AJAX.p  pFor some reason though, Spring Security doesnt convert this into an actual token, it just gets sent into the header as a literal string csrf.token.p  pTrying the alternate route of using codecsrf.tokencode in a hidden input according to the documentation, I then tried to check what the token evaluates to by checking the inputs value, but its still just plain text csrf.token.p  pSince it seems that Spring Security isnt in effect, am I missing some kind of configuration I am currently using a barebones Spring Security Java configuration as opposed to xml as shown here p  precodeimport org.springframework.context.annotation. import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.

Negative 64 pIt seems codegruntcodes default logging functions, accessed through codegrunt.log.ltmethodgtcode, have become deprecated. codegruntcodes repo page on GitHub has a new repository, first commit less than 2 weeks ago, called gruntlegacylog, where legacy implies old, not used anymore except for backwards compatibility. Also, the main page detailing the API for these functions, a hrefhttpgruntjs.comapigrunt.log relnofollowhttpgruntjs.comapigrunt.loga, has a broken link at the top of the page, whose target gives a 404 error.p  pWhy has this happened All I could find through a simple Google search was a a hrefhttpsgithub.comgruntjsgruntissues1130 relnofollowGitHub discussiona where the commenters seem to have planned this out, but whatever they did wasnt documented anywhere else that I could find. They seem to be referring to an earlier discussion, but they dont link to it. codegruntcodes blog says codegruntcodes logging API has been broken out into a separate module, codegruntlegacylogcode, in order to facilitate maintenance, but it doesnt expand on what this means. Why are they performing maintenance Why is it being called legacy, if they are not deprecating itp  pSo is the logging capability deprecated If so, what are we supposed to do to log in codegruntcode now I assume we wont have to use JavaScripts codedocument.writecode method, even if it worked for codegruntcode, but what are we expected to use If not, what is going on and why is codegruntcode using the word legacyp

If there is no text in that button, it continues the function, if there is preexisting text then it gives an alert stating that there is already an entry there.p  pEssentially, the user clicks a button and the code checks to see if that button is empty or not.

Negative 64 pThere is an acm problem saying that we have two binary cryptographied strings. some bits are replaced with english alphabet a, b, c,.... we want to assign each alphabet one bit  0 or 1  That the diffrence between two strings is minimum  possible. what is the best algorithm for this each alphabet is only 1 or 0  in both strings  for example  string1 11b0c101ab string2 11001101bb  b0 amp c1 amp a0 another example string1 11110bbbbb string2 aaaaaa0000  b0 amp a1 in this case these two strings cant be the same but if we assign a1 and b0 the diffrences between two case becomes minimump

Negative 64 pIm trying to build a GCM notification listener, which will basically use the notification to flag the user that some operation should be made which involve communicating with my remote AppServer. I assumed that I should create a UIless application running on the devices startup and listen to the GCM notifications and issue the internal android notification. When the user opens the notification an activity will be opened which will do the rest of the job with the remote AppServer. Looking at notification examples it seems to me that I may be missing some basic understanding since all te examples which I had found use a UI application to manipulate the notifications. What do I missp

Negative 64 pI have tried searching through a lot of S.O. pages but nothing has touched EXACTLY on this top while also NOT USING JQUERY.... I am trying to stick to pure JavaScript as I want to learn it 115 before advancing my current knowledge of JQuery.p  pI have an object called ScreenResizeTool like this...p  precodefunction ScreenResizeToolcurrImg      window.addEventHandlerresize, function          listencurrImg     , true  codepre  pand a method like this...p  precodeScreenResizeTool.prototype.listen  functioncurrImg      Random Code For Resizing  codepre  pMy trouble is probably obvious to an experienced JavaScript user but I am having trouble not making this into a messy dirty awful OOP set. I have done various tests to show and prove to myself that the codethiscode inside the addEventHandler changes when it becomes bound to the window. This much I assumed before testing but I was able to see that once window.resize event happens the listen method is gone and not a part of the global window variable....p  pI have also tried adding a codethiscode capture such as codethis.me  thiscode inside the object constructor however it also couldnt see the codemecode variable once it ran. Once the window took the function over it no longer knew anything about the codemecode variable or any reference to my class methods....p  pI am aware that I could separate this differently but my goal here is to learn how to fully encapsulate and use as many clean OOP structures as possible as I just came from the .NET world and I need it in my life.p  pI am also aware that I could make messy calls and or store this object or access to the methods inside the window variable but that seems outright wrong to me. I should be able to fully encapsulate this object and have its events and methods all implemented in this class structure.p  pI also know that the currImg variable is not going to be seen either but lets start small here. I assume once I figure out my incorrect train of thought on scope for JavaScript I should be fine to figure out the currImg problem.p  pI know theres 1000 JavaScript programmers out there waiting to rip me a new one over asking this simple question but I gotta know...p  pThoughts anyonep

Negative 64 pI used micro CT it generates a kind of 3D image object to evaluate my samples which were shaped like a cone. However the main surface which should be flat can not always be placed parallel to the surface of image stacks. To perform the transform, first of all, I have to find a way to identify the flat surface. Therefore I learnt python to read the image data into numpy array. p  pThen I realized that I totally have no clue how to achieve the idea in a mathematical way.  If you have any idea or any suggestion or even packages would be so appreciated.  p

If you cannot see the webpage, or have to make an account and dont want to, the problem is listed in plain text below.p  h2Questionh2  pMy C code is timing out, but my python code is not. I first suspected this was due to overflow, but I used codesizeofcode to be sure that codeunsigned long longcode can reach code264  1code, the upper limit of the problem.p  pI practically translated my C code directly into Python to see if it was my algorithms causing the timeouts, but to my surprise my Python code passed every test case.p  pC codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  bool potunsigned long long n      if n  2  0 return potn2     return n1  returns true if n is power of two   unsigned long long gptunsigned long long n      unsigned long long i  1     while2i lt n          i  2          return i  returns greatest power of two less than n   int main          unsigned int t     stdcin gtgt t     stdcout ltlt sizeofunsigned long long ltlt stdendl     forunsigned int i  0 i lt t i              unsigned long long n         unsigned long long count  1         stdcin gtgt n         whilen gt 1              if potn n  2             else n  gptn             count                  if count  2  0 stdcout ltlt Louise ltlt stdendl         else stdcout ltlt Richard ltlt stdendl       codepre  pPython 2.7 codep  precodedef potn     while n  2  0         n2     return n1  def gptn     i  1     while 2i lt n         i  2     return i  t  intrawinput for i in ranget     n  intrawinput     count  1     while n  1         if potn             n  2         else             n  gptn         count  1     if count  2  0         print Louise     else         print Richard codepre  pTo me, both versions look identical. I still think Im somehow being fooled and am actually getting overflow, causing timeouts, in my C code.p  h2Problemh2  pLouise and Richard play a game. They have a counter is set to N. Louise gets the first turn and the turns alternate thereafter. In the game, they perform the following operations.p  pIf N is not a power of 2, they reduce the counter by the largest power of 2 less than N.p  pIf N is a power of 2, they reduce the counter by half of N.p  pThe resultant value is the new N which is again used for subsequent operations.p  pThe game ends when the counter reduces to 1, i.e., N  1, and the last person to make a valid move wins.p  pGiven N, your task is to find the winner of the game.p  pInput Format p  pThe first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases.  T lines follow. Each line contains N, the initial number set in the counter.p  pConstraintsp  p1  T  10 p  p1  N  264  1p  pOutput Formatp  pFor each test case, print the winners name in a new line. So if Louise wins the game, print Louise. Otherwise, print Richard. Quotes are for clarityp  pSample Inputp  p1p  p6p  pSample Outputp  pRichardp  pExplanationp  pAs 6 is not a power of 2, Louise reduces the largest power of 2 less than 6 i.e., 4, and hence the counter reduces to 2.p  pAs 2 is a power of 2, Richard reduces the counter by half of 2 i.e., 1. Hence the counter reduces to 1.p  pAs we reach the terminating condition with N  1, Richard wins the game.p

So far both codeQListWidgetItemscode will have the same size 200px width and 180px height. While it may fit on the first codeQListWidgetItemcode, because it has only 300 characters, it may not fit on the second codeQListWidgetItemcode, because of the 1000 characters. Therefore I would like to somehow dynamically adjust the size of the codeQListWidgetItemcode regarding the needed space first one will need less than the second one.p

However, when I replace codemyreg[7] lt incode with say, codemyreg[7] lt 5code, the code works as expected. The code also works when I assign directly to codeoutcode after declaring it as register i.e. codeout lt incode.

Negative 64 pI am having a problem with a school assignment. The assignment is to write a metamorphic Hello World program. This program will produce 10 .com files that print Hello World when executed. Each of the 10 .com files must be different from the others. I understand the concept of metamorphic vs oligomorphic vs polymorphic. My program currently creates 10 .com files and then writes the machine code to the files. I began by simply writing only the machine code to print hello world and tested it. It worked just fine. I then tried to add a decryption routine to the beginning of the machine code. Here is my current byte arrayp  precodedefine ARRAYSIZEarray sizeofarraysizeofarray[0] BYTE pushCS  0x0E BYTE popDS  0x1F BYTE movDX  0xBA BYTE helloAddr1  0x1A BYTE helloAddr2  0x01 BYTE movAH  0xB4 BYTE nine  0x09 BYTE Int  0xCD BYTE tOne  0x21 BYTE movAX  0xB8 BYTE ret1  0x01 BYTE ret2  0x4C BYTE movBL  0xB3 BYTE keyVal  0x03  EncryptDecrypt key  typedef unsigned char BYTE  BYTE data[]   0x8D, 0x0E, 0x01, 0xB7, 0x1D, 0xB3, keyVal, 0x30, 0x1C, 0x46, 0xFE, 0xCF, 0x75, 0xF9,               movDX, helloAddr1, helloAddr2, movAH, nine, Int, tOne, movAX, ret1, ret2, Int, tOne,                0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F, 0x20, 0x57, 0x6F, 0x72, 0x6C, 0x64, 0x21, 0x0D, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x24  codepre  pThe decryption portion of the machine code is the first 14 bytes of data. This decryption routine would take the obfuscated machine code bytes and decrypt them by xoring the bytes with the same key that was used to encrypt them. I am encrypting the bytes in my C code with thisp  precodefor int i  15 i lt ARRAYSIZEdata i      data[i]  keyVal  codepre  pI have verified over and over again that my addressing is correct considering that the code begins at offset 100. What I have noticed is that when keyVal is 0x00, my code runs fine and I get 10 .com files that print Hello World. However, this does me no good as 0x00 leaves everything unchanged. When I provide an actual key like 0x02, my program no longer works. It simply hangs until I close out DosBox. Any hints as to the cause of this would be a great help. I have some interesting plans for junk insertion The actual metamorphic part but I dont want to move on to that until I figure out this encryptdecrypt issue. p

Negative 64 pI am new to Spring and am having trouble getting fresh data for a user. I have a class called CustomUserDetailsService which implements UserDetailsServiceand Serializable. In it I have a function called loadUserByUsernameString which returns a class called MyUser which implements User. Everything works mostly as expected A user can view a list of data objects from the UI, post via a form, and add entries to the list and the changes will get propagated. The problem arises when someone else that is not the current user, makes a change to the data adds an entry, the current user will not see that change to the list until his session either times out or he clears his cache and fetches new data. What are some possible things I could be doing wrong here I can destroy the jsession cookie with javascript every page load, but then I would loose Springs advanced session caching system. Thanksp

Also, no autocomplete results are appearing, so the user cant pick one to then trigger a placechanged event and carry on getting the distance, etc.p  pExample code here showing the problem a hrefhttpcomparerideshare.comtest.html relnofollowhttpcomparerideshare.comtest.htmlap  pTestingp  ul liWorks fine on desktop browsers, tried FF, Chrome and Safari on OSX so far.li liWorks fine on my Nexus 7 tablet using Chrome. ul liDidnt try other browsers.

Negative 64 pI have seen similar questions to this so this might well be a dup but...p  pI have a third party C based web application that is also using jQuery.  The target platform will be Windows tablets that are in kiosk mode.  The tablets will be affixed to walls and will have a card swipe reader usb keyboard mode attached.  The application of course runs in a web browser and we have tried the following using IE 11 and the latest Chrome.p  pWhen you interact with the device the application displays a button.  When clicked via finger a popup appears that has a single codeltinputgtcode field and a button.p  pWe very much want the popup to display the field with focus set in it already.p  p If we run the app in a nonIE browser on a desktop  nontablet everything just works. IE will set focus but then does not recognise the onchange event when the usb card reader sends it data.p  p Running the app on a tablet is a bust.  IE will usually set focus if we use the MS codesetImmediatecode method but it will not recognize the onchange event.  NonIE browsers do not set focus but if focus is manually set touch the input field then the onchange event is activated by the card reader.p  pBefore you ask... yes, we have contacted the third party developers but have not heard anything yet.p  p I can not leverage the initial buttons onclick event either.  I am guessing that it is controlled by C or .Net or whatever is under the hood.  Setting js events on it is totally ignored.p  p Setting codeautoFocuscode on the input field seems to be a noop.p  pGoogling seems to say that not allowing the programmatic setting of focus on tablets is a positive design feature.

Of course these variables end up being factories, services, constants etc in the dependencies specified when the app was created.p  pFor example herep  precodeangular.modulemyApp, [ngRoute] .configfunctionrouteProvider    routeProvider.when,      controller WelcomeController,     template viewswelcome.html     .configfunctionConnectionProvider    ConnectionProvider.setApiKeySOMEAPIKEY  codepre  pHow on Earth, in a large app, would I know that coderouteProvidercode came from codengRoutecode, or where did codeConnectionProvidercode come from Also, on the flip side, is there a way to get a quick look at what factories and services are available for use from the dependenciesp

Negative 64 pI loop through a number of messages with an unixtime as well as an userid, where I want to find the number of messages inside a 24 hr time slot for each user. I posted my code on a hrefhttpcodereview.stackexchange.composts83410editcodereviewa to get some help. From there I optimized the               p  precodecur.executeSELECT unixtime FROM MessageType1 WHERE userID struserID[index] ORDER BY unixtime asc codepre  pquery as I found that it compromized of 6.7s of the total 7.2s running time of my code. I optimized it by making indexes on the unixtime column using codeCREATE INDEX unixtimetimes ON MessageType1 unixtime asccode.

Negative 64 pIve been reading a hrefhttpwww.serpentine.comwreqtutorial.htmlA wreq tutorialap  blockquote   pA lens provides a way to focus on a portion of a Haskell value. For   example, the codeResponsecode type has a coderesponseStatuscode lens, which   focuses on the status information returned by the server.p  precodeghcigt r . responseStatus Status statusCode  200, statusMessage  OK codepre      pThe code.code operator takes a value as its first argument, a lens as its   second, and returns the portion of the value focused on by the lens.p      pWe compose lenses using function composition, which allows us to   easily focus on part of a deeply nested structure.p  precodeghcigt r . responseStatus . statusCode 200 codepre blockquote  pI cant come up with a way how function composition done with this order of arguments could treat the nesting structure in that order.p  pLook coder . responseStatus . statusCodecode could be either coder . responseStatus . statusCodecode or coder . responseStatus . statusCodecode.p  pIn the first one says we construct a function which strongfirststrong treats codestatusCodecode gets it from the record codeStatuscode  as I can deduce from the shown value codeStatus statusCode  200, statusMessage  OKcode, and then passes it to coderesponseStatuscode which must treat the response status. So, its the other way round in reality, the status code is a part of the response status.p  pThe second reading also doesnt make sense to me because it treats the status code first, too.p

Negative 64 pI have a listview with a listview.itemtemplate and data template with the below xaml controls as the template elements.  I also created a custom class to hold the data which binds to these objects.p  ul liTextblock the text of which is binded to the Title value from my custom class.li liTextBox the text of which is binded to the Value value from my custom class.li liComboBox a list of text which is binded to the Units value from my custom class. li ul  pI also have a ComboBoxLoaded event that fires after the combobox is loaded...I do this because sometimes I want to modify the UI elements based on different params and I could find no other way to programmatically modify UI elements for each listview item.p  pEverything works fine until I have more than 10 listview items that I want to bind.  For items 110, all my UI data is populated via data in my custom class and I can do the programmatic work I need to modify UI elements.  But once I get to item 11, on the emulator I can actually see the majority of the view is loaded and when item 11s combobox calls the ComboboxLoaded method, the combobox is empty.  Even more strange, if I let the view completely load and then select the combobox of an 11 item, I can see the data that should have been populated in the combobox and can select these items.  The problem being, on items 11, I cant set the selectedindex of any of these items nor modify any other UI elements because the data isnt being seen until after I select it.p  pSo does anyone know if there is a limit on the number of items that can be bound via binding and data from custom classes  I have to assume yes because this only is an issue when my number of items is greater than 10...anything lt 10 works as expected.p

Negative 64 pI have a general design issue in my code, which I am not sure how to best solve. I have created a Log class for logging purposes, the log class derives from the QObject class and has signal and slots.Each time data is written to the Logs buffer a signal is emitted, which is can be connected to a objects slot that flushes this buffer to the file.Any module in the system can create a log using the Log class for logging purpose. p  pI also have a Logger class, which provides a thread to handle flushing the contents of the Log buffer to file in the background. I do this by transferring the thread affinity of the Log objects class to the logger thread whenever I create a new log object.p  pI need a global log that can be accessed by all modules in my code, so I declare a Log outside main, but I get the following warning  strongQEventLoop Cannot be used without QApplicationstrong. I think the problem is because I have a global QObject with an event loop that gets defined before QApplication.p  pMy code works fine and everything logs just okay, but I am not 100 sure if I should just simply ignore the warning or try and avoid it altogether, I would prefer the latter. Any thoughts on how to get around this or improve the design would be most helpful.p  pThanksp  pBelow is a  snippet of my code from main.p  precode  DebugLog gDebugLog      int mainint argc, char argv[]              QApplication aargc, argv          Logger logger          voidlogger.Init         ServicesManagerRegisterLoggerServiceamplogger  Register the logger service         ServicesManagerGetLoggerServicegtAddLoggDebugLog          gDebugLog.DEBUGInitializing global services          .....

BUT with respect to AN INSTANCE of B, A can only access codepubliccode members not codeprotectedcode or codeno modifierpackage privatecode ones, am I right on this.p  p5 if a class A inherits from another class B, and they share the same package, A has all the members fields and methods declared codepubliccode , codeprotectedcode AND codeno modifierspackage privatecodein B am I right. Since A and B are in the same package, A is able to access codeprotectedcode , codeno modifierpackage privatecode members of any instance of B and of course codepubliccode ones as well.p  pIn addition, since A isa B which members will another class say, C trying to access a member of A of one of its instance of course, but lets keep it simple be able to get to I know for sure C will be able to access codepubliccode members, but what about codeprotectedcode , or codeno modifierpackage privatecode ones in case 4 and 5  I leave codeprivatecode aside, since those members can only be accessed inside the defining classp  pplease, helpp  pThis is what happens in terms of accessinheritance p  precodepackage one  class with all kind of modifiers public class A       protected void methodProtected      public void methodPublic      void methodDefault      private void methodPrivate   codepre  hr  precodesame package,no inheritance package one  public class B                new A.methodDefault         new A.methodProtected         new A.methodPublic        codepre  hr  precodesame package,inheritance package one  public class C extends A                new A.methodDefault         new A.methodProtected         new A.methodPublic         methodDefault         methodProtected         methodPublic        codepre  hr  precodedifferent package,inheritance package two import one.A  public class D extends A               new A.methodPublic         A a  new A         compiler error cant access protected members         a.methodProtected         methodPublic         methodProtected        codepre  hr  precodedifferent package,no inheritance package two import one.      public class E                        new A.methodPublic                codepre  pnow, I would like to know what happens when E tries to access B,C or D, and what if E inherits from A or one of the other classes, or is in the same package what a mess... p

They say that the email body is full of GT and LS symbols like this ltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltp  pI am 100 sure that this is something on the client side perhaps with their email client or browser.

As humans we will one day pass from this earth leaving behind us a legacy and a responsibility to the generations that follow this responsibility is to lead mankind and to guarantee progression. This can be achieved by starting at the very beginning, as the solution to any answer has to be solved from the beginning our children are the answer and our educational system is the problem.     ltpgt      ltpgt Nowadays, children are being subjected to a great deal of inappropriate media and distraction. In this current era that we are living in, almost every child from a wellfinanced family has an electronic device, be it smart phone, or a tab or a laptop. Most children are easily distracted and are usually attracted towards games and flashy programssoftware because it appeals to them. Their attention span is usually confined to that which interests them and it is very hard for them to focus.     ltpgt      ltpgt For example, a child would usually prefer watching a movie than reading a novel. It is very difficult to allow a child to both learn something educational and at the same time be entertained. However, what the researchers are trying to create is a program that will hopefully include both.    ltpgt      ltasidegt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idfootergt         ltfootergt             Copyright ampcopy Kindergarten Together 2015         ltfootergt     ltdivgt      ltbodygt     lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 64 pProject Description Excel Interface that openseditscloses an access database using variable types DAO.Database amp DAO.Recordset in VBA.p  pProblem Statement Some users do not have the correct dll mapped ACEDAO.dll in Access. This means the Microsoft Office 15.0 Access database engine Object Library is not an available reference under tools in the Access VBA window.p  pCurrent Progress in troubleshooting I can open a blank Access database on the affected users PC, map to the correct dll, and the reference will appear and be checked. The excel interface will work fine, but only when the dummy database is already open. The dummy database can be closed and reopened and the reference will still be there and be checked. So the current workaround is having affected users having to open a secondary database to use the Excel interface.p  pThanks, JBp

It seems that a hrefhttpsauth0.comblog20140107angularjsauthenticationwithcookiesvstoken relnofollowtokens are a better method than cookiesa, but that has effects on the exchange of secretstokens.  the xhr.withCredentials method seems to be cookie based for instance.

But I am unsure how to capture and correspond this to each IP as it is not synchronous anymore. p  pCurrent Code.p  precodepublic string pspasswrdstring ip, string user, string password      String CD  Directory.GetCurrentDirectory  pspasswrd.exe     ProcessStartInfo p  new ProcessStartInfo     string result  null     p.FileName  CD     p.Arguments    ip     user     password   accepteula     p.CreateNoWindow  true     p.RedirectStandardOutput  true     p.RedirectStandardError  true     p.UseShellExecute  false     Process x  Process.Startp     StreamReader stream  x.StandardOutput     result  stream.ReadToEnd     x.waitforexit     x.Close     return result   private void bExecuteClick1object sender, EventArgs e      String password  tbPassword.Text     String temppassword  password     int baseNumber  0     int increaseBy  0     int currentNumber  0     if cbNumber.Checked              baseNumber  Convert.ToInt32tbnumber.Text         increaseBy  Convert.ToInt32tbIncrements.Text         currentNumber  baseNumber          richTextBox1.Clear     richTextBox1.AppendTextComputer,User,Password  Environment.NewLine     foreachDataGridViewRow row in dgvComputers.Rows              ifrow.IsNewRow                      if PingHostrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString  true                              foreach DataGridViewRow irow in dgvInclude.Rows                                      if irow.IsNewRow                                              if cbNumber.Checked                                                      temppassword  password  currentNumber                             ifpspasswrdrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString, irow.Cells[0].Value.ToString, temppassword.Containssuccessfully  true                                                              richTextBox1.AppendTextrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString       irow.Cells[0].Value.ToString       temppassword                                 richTextBox1.AppendTextEnvironment.NewLine                                 currentNumber  currentNumber  increaseBy                                                          else                                                              richTextBox1.AppendTextrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString       irow.Cells[0].Value.ToString     Password Change Failed                                 richTextBox1.AppendTextEnvironment.NewLine                                                                                else if cbMAC.Checked                                                      temppassword  password  GetMACrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString                             pspasswrdrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString, irow.Cells[0].Value.ToString, temppassword                             richTextBox1.AppendTextrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString       irow.Cells[0].Value.ToString  ,  temppassword                             richTextBox1.AppendTextEnvironment.NewLine                                                                                         else                 richTextBox1.AppendTextrow.Cells[0].Value.ToString     Is not responding.

Negative 64 pThis has bothered me for a little while now. I may be over reacting, let me know if I am. But, I feel like adding image assets to your Android Studio project is harder than it should be. Not necessarily saying its difficult to do, but I feel like it should be one of the easiest things to do.p  pI am a bit new to AS, so I could be way out of line here. p  pIm working on a project, and I want to add a test image real quick to put in an image view. Not having done this yet I just assume I can click an image file I have on my desktop and drag into my resdrawable folder in the AS window. I quickly realized I cant. I then realize I can drag the image into the view port in AS and it opens there. I assume I can quickly save it into my drawable assets, but again, no luck.p  pSo the next thing I try is to right click on the drawable folder knowing there will be an add option. I see add a new file. Try that, and it has me tell it what kind of file it is, assuming Ill then be asked to tell it my images file path and then have it added to the project. Nope It creates an empty image file with no way I can tell of telling it what image I want in my project. p  pI keep poking around and realize that theres also a NewAsset Image option when I right click the drawable directory. I finally feel relieved. I click on it and it opens up the Launcher Icon settings. I can change the type of image from Launcher Icon, Action Bar and Tab Icons, and Notification Icons. Theres actually a file path option, so yeah it worked. I was able to add my image.p  pBut my question is, why are those my only options for images I want in my project. Arent almost all apps primarily made of images Why is this process necessary to add every single image And again, why would an image need to be classified as one of those three option. What about games I havent made a game yet, but almost everything in a game is an image asset and NOT an icon.p  pIs there another completely obvious way to add non icon image assets to your project Am I completely over reacting, just because I need to label all images as some kind of icon, even though it doesnt really matter Let me know how ridiculous or right minded Im being below. p  pThanksp
