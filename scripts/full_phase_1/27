Positive 27 pCurrently Im trying to do the layout for my shopping website. Ive come across weird problem I do not understand whether its my fault or a browser but Im more likely to think that Ive done something wrong.. My page is not loading fully, it looks like browser loads a part of it and then stops. However if I put some even random words or letters below the code, for each letter I put a one character of expected content shows up. And there is nothing apart from some php that should now affect html view I guess, and bootstrap used apart from html.p  pAnd since the html I wrote is rather long Ill post those parts in a github gists to make this post more readable. p  pHeres the code a hrefhttpsgist.github.comkbialy9273301401014624de3f73 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comkbialy9273301401014624de3f73ap  pSo is it a problem that is somehow connected to the browser, memory usage or just the code written incorrectlyp  pThanks in advancep

But if you press the refresh button it loads everything but the WebSocket request freezes for a little while. When done freezing the server picks up a couple 2 requests but the first lines are codenullcode, therefor the server stops handling the request and waits for a new request. Then the server picks up a correct WebSocket request and everything continues on as intended. But if you refresh while it is frozen, the server connects to the previous WebSocket and correctly sends codeindex.htmlcode and codestyle.csscode, but fails to send codescript.jscode and throws a codejava.net.SocketExceptioncode and a codejava.lang.NegativeArraySizeExceptioncode because it tries to read a negative number 124 bytes of data.p  pstrongOn FireFoxstrong Wame as google chrome, but it happens randomly instead of when the refresh button is pressed.p  pI also cant connect to the server if a WebSocket is opened, wich is probably because the WebSocket reads the request that the ServerSocket is supposed to read, but im not sure about this and i have no idea how to fix this.p

Positive 27 pDoes any web browser support native deflateinflate or are there any plans for such support I mean a way to access those functions through javascript.p  pThe DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3 is specified at a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc1951.txt relnofollowhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc1951.txta and PNG and WOFF use it as a compression scheme, which means that new browsers have support for both INFLATE and DEFLATE. Also browsers can decompress on the fly files that are compressed on a server.p  pI have searched about this a lot, but it seems that NONE OF THE BROWSERS LET USER TO ACCESS DEFLATEINFLATE FUNCTIONALITY AND USING EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES IS THE ONLY OPTION, eg.br  a hrefhttpsgithub.comnodecapako relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnodecapakoabr  a hrefhttpsgithub.comimayazlib.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comimayazlib.jsa  p  pFor me it seems a bit odd to use external libraries when there is a native and probably significantly faster way builtin, but access to it is forbidden by browser.p  pNowadays there are a lot of browser apis that allow binary data handling typed arrays, file reader, blob, streams etc, but the control of compressing and decompressing this data is not made too easy.p

Positive 27 pI am working on a nav menu which contains some external url links, There are focus styles associated with the navigation menu , like the menu item gets a background when it is focused. If an item, that is an anchor which points to an external link, is clicked, it opens a new tab and displays the page that is represented by that external link. My  problem is that, even though a new tab is opened when the user comes back to the original tab, he can still see the background behind the clicked nav menu item.

Negative 27 pWe have an application that is built upon ADO.NET.  We follow some simple best practices that allow us to make use of the connection pool.  For example, a block of code that is using a database might look something like thisp  blockquote precodeusing DbConnection dbConnection  GetDatabaseConnection          doWork  codepre blockquote  pFWIW, theres nothing special about GetDatabaseConnection.  It establishes a connection with the database which is running MSSQL Server 2000.  In fact, it reads as followsp  blockquote precodeDbConnection GetDatabaseConnection      return GetConnectionMyConnectionString   DbConnection GetConnectionString connectionString    try        SqlConnection dbConnection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString       dbConnection.Open       return dbConnection    catch InvalidOperationException ex         handleErrorex       throw    catch DbException ex         handleErrorex     codepre blockquote  pAs such, our connections are disposed of at the end of the block scope.  However, we ran into a little glitch as we began to test the application.  We found that our application is very bursty meaning there are times when it becomes very chatty and then goes silent for a while.  The result is that we can have multiple threads simultaneously all coming up to obtain a connection.p  pSo imagine you have 10 threads.  A batch of work please dont try to rephrase the batch of work arrives and is segmented across a few threads.  Each thread then attempts to obtain a connection and boom, Im hit with an InvalidOperationException.  Ive adjusted the ConnectTimeout and all that does is stretch out the time until I get a burst of exceptions.  Once I get past the windup phase, the application is fine.  Then it quiesces again, the connections go away and the process begins again.p  pIve also tried tweaking the LoadBalanceTimeout but the exceptions continue to roll in.  Have any of you seen this issue before  Any thoughts ... Ill throw out a couple of my own.p  ul liContinually keep some connection hotli liAttempt to open the connection again up to some  of attemptsli liImplement my own connection pooling bleah, not interested in reinventing the wheelli ul  pEditp  pMost forums Ive read have discouraged increasing the connection pool size.  By default the connection pool has an upper bound of 50 connections thats more than enough  if I have to increase it, somethings fundamentally wrong elsewhere.  What I notice is that when the ConnectTimeout is low, the InvalidOperationException occurs.  Its as if the spinup of the connection is too long and the pending connections all timeout.p  pMARS is certainly an option... The text of the InvalidOperationException.Message isp  pTimeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool.  This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached.p
Negative 27 pI have to interface with a slightly archaic system that doesnt use webservices. In order to send data to this system, I need to post an XML document into a iformi on the other systems website. This XML document can get very large so I would like to compress it.  The other system sits on IIS and I use C my end. I could of course implement something that compresses the data before posting it, but that requires the other system to change so it can decompress the data. I would like to avoid changing the other system as I dont own it.   p  pI have heard vague things about enabling compression  http 1.1 in IIS and the browser but I have no idea how to translate that to my program. Basically, is there some property I can set in my program that will make my program automatically compress the data that it is sending to IIS and for IIS to seamlessly decompress it so the receiving app doesnt even know the difference p  pHere is some sample code to show roughly what I am doing    p  precodeprivate static void demo               Stream myRequestStream  null         Stream myResponseStream  null          HttpWebRequest myWebRequest  HttpWebRequestSystem.Net                               .WebRequest.Createhttpexample.com         byte[] bytMessage  null         bytMessage  Encoding.ASCII.GetBytesdataxyz         myWebRequest.ContentLength  bytMessage.Length         myWebRequest.Method  POST           Set the content type as form so that the data          will be posted as form                       myWebRequest.ContentType  applicationxwwwformurlencoded          Get Stream object          myRequestStream  myWebRequest.GetRequestStream          Writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream             myRequestStream.WritebytMessage, 0, bytMessage.Length          Close stream         myRequestStream.Close          WebResponse myWebResponse  myWebRequest.GetResponse         myResponseStream  myWebResponse.GetResponseStream  codepre  pdataxyz will actually be data[a several MB XML document].p  pI am aware that this question may ultimately fall under the nonprogramming banner if this is achievable through nonprogrammatic means so apologies in advance.p

We simply pointed Visual Studio to a directory and started building pages We had a combination of inline aspx pages and aspxcodebehind pages.  We simply pushed the files up to a server and that was that.  All classes and services sat in the AppCode directory or Bin if we needed any 3rd party functionality. We never used the build feature in .Net and everything was, for the most part, JIT compiled.  Debugging was done the oldschool Response.Write way.p  pB A project is created.  There are Resx files, sln files and project files etc.. The project is compiled, built and debugged the way that Im sure most .Net developers are used to. Everything is very tied to the VS IDE and trying to open the project in another copy of Visual Studio requires the same directorieslocalhost settings as whoever originated the project.p  pIt would be interesting to hear from people who have worked in both implementations and the benefits they find on either side.  p  pMy reason for asking is that Im thinking Id like to steer my current dev team more towards the A implementation and cut out all of these peripheral files and configurations that lock you into VS, but Im also open to hearing the benefits of drinking the Microsoft KoolAid as well.p
Negative 27 pIm working on a rails app that has a whole bunch of before filters in the userscontroller which look up users stateful roles provided by Acts as State Machine. They look something like thisp  precodeclass UsersController lt ApplicationController  beforefilter notloggedinrequired, only gt [new, create] beforefilter finduserorcurrentuser, only gt [edit, update] beforefilter finduser, only gt [suspend, unsuspend, destroy, purge] beforefilter adminrequired, only gt [suspend, unsuspend, destroy, purge] beforefilter checkadministratorrole, only [index, suspend, destroy, purge] codepre  pWith all of this checking of states for each action controlled by the UsersController, performance is becoming an issue, with SQL queries to the Users Column taking upwards of 5ms on my machine.p  pIm only assuming all of these filters play a part in the dragging performance, and Im wondering how to best refactor these to improve the reading from the database.p

Additionally, each integer need not contain the same number of digits.p  pI am supposed to sort the numbers in the array such that the resulting array has the integers ordered in a lexicographic manner i.e they are sorted based on their string representations.

Finally, I removed the padded zeros, converted the strings back to their integers and put them in the resulting array. This was a very inefficient solution.p  pIve been led to believe that the solution doesnt need padding etc and there is a simple solution where you just have to process the numbers in some way some bit processing to get the result.p  pWhat is the spacewise most efficient solution you can think of Timewisep  pIf you are giving code, Id prefer Java or pseudocode.

Negative 27 pI have a set of Win32 applications that share information using a shared memory segment created with codeCreateFileMappingcode  and codeMapViewOfFilecode.

Normal users are not allowed to create Win32 error 5 objects in the global namespace.

Negative 27 pI am writing an installer using Wix 3 which installs a plugin to a 3rd party application.  The application uses a group of registry keys to detect installed plugins. Each plugin is required to add a new subkey with a numerical name from 09 to the codeHKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREVendorAppPluginscode.  The key contains a single string value which is the ProgId of a COM component which the application will instantiate.

Negative 27 pIve never seen this done but I had an idea of doing authorization in a more purely OO way. For each method that requires authorization we associate a delegate. During initialization of the class we wire up the delegates so that they point to the appropriate method based on the users rights. For examplep  precodeclass User      private deleteMemberDelegate deleteMember      public StatusMessage DeleteMemberMember member              ifdeleteMember  null in practice every delegate will point to some method, even if its an innocuous one that just reports Access Denied                      deleteMembermember                    other methods defined similarly...      Userstring name, string password cstor.              wire up delegates based on users rights.          Thus we handle authentication and authorization in the same method.        codepre  pThis way the client code never has to explictly check whether or not a user is in a role, it just calls the method. Of course each method should return a status message so that we know if and why it failed.p  pThoughtsp

Unfortunately, an   instance of Blob or Clob is only   useable until the JDBC transaction   completes. strongSo if your persistent class   defines a property of java.sql.Clob or   java.sql.Blob not a good idea   anyway, youll be restricted in how   instances of the class may be used.strong In   particular, you wont be able to use   instances of that class as detached   objects. Furthermore, many JDBC   drivers dont feature working support   for java.sql.Blob and java.sql.Clob.   Therefore, it makes more sense to map   large objects using the binary or text   mapping type, assuming retrieval of   the entire large object into memory   isnt a performance killer. p      pNote you   can find uptodate design patterns   and tips for large object usage on the   Hibernate website, with tricks for   particular platforms.p blockquote  pNow emapparentlyem the Blob cannot be used, as it is strongnot a good idea anywaystrong, what else could be used to improve the performance I couldnt find any stronguptodate design patternstrong or any useful information on Hibernate website.

Negative 27 pIve seen this problem on the web, and all the suggested solutions arent working for me, so I thought Id come here. I have a page that has an iframe. The top of the page is a dropdown menu, the rest of the page is the iframe. The idea like Im sure everybody else does, is to have the menu stay stationary and the menu selection runs an application in the iframe. The contents of the iframe should scroll, but the page as a whole should not.

I want to keep the scroll bar in the iframe as auto, but I dont ever want a scroll bar for the whole page. I need the iframe to size appropriately so it always takes up exactly the remainder of the page so the browser doesnt have to make a scroll bar because the iframe should never extend off the bottom of the viewing area.p

Negative 27 pIm using a frame layout similar to the one in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2857412ie6framelayoutwith100heightandscrollbars28583412858341this excellent answera a div top at the top of the page, a divleft on the left, and a div main with the main content.  The top and left divs contain navigation menus.p  pNow I want to use a popup div using the AjaxControlToolkit ModalPopupExtender inside the content main div.p  pThis works fine on IE8 where top, left, main all have positionfixed, but when I run it on IE6, the modal background only covers the main div  I need it to cover the whole of the page including the top and left navigation divs.p  pLooking at the script for ModalPopupExtender, it appears to be searching up the parent hierarchy until it finds a parent with position relative or absolute.  And in the IE6 rendering, the main div has positionabsolute because positionfixed is not supported, which I guess explains what is happening.p  pAny suggestions for the besteasiest way to get this working properly on IE6  Ideally without modifying the ModalPopupExtender code, but Ill do this if I have to and its the best solution.p

Negative 27 pI recently read Eric Steven Raymonds article How To Become A Hacker and I like his suggestion of learning 5 key languages he suggests Python, CC, Lisp, Java, and Perl as a way of covering the main programming paradigms in use today.p  pHis advice is that its not so important which specific languages a programmer knows.  Its more important to know different approaches to programming, for two reasons.  p  pThe first reason is that it makes it trivial to pick up a new language, once you know the general approach to the way it solves problems.p  pThe second reason is that there is no one best language  they all have tradeoffs.  It would be best to know what type of language to pick given a specific type of problem.  This is what Im most interested in, but Im having a problem really distinguishing between the 5 languages he suggests.  There seems to be a lot of overlap.p  pSo my specific question is, given these 5 languages, what is their intended programming paradigm, and give one example of the type of problem it would be best suited for.p  pAn example answer and Im not sure this answer is correctp  precodePerl  mainly a functional language  great for quick text substitutions in multiple files from the command line. codepre  pI found a few other similar questions posted, but Id like to know about these 5 languages in particular.

Negative 27 pUsing SQlite I have a large database split into years    DB2006thru2007.sq3    DB2008thru2009.sq3    DBcurrent.sq3 They all have a single table call histtbl with two columns key, data.p  pThe requirements are 1. to be able to access all the data at once. 2. inserts only go to the current version. 3. the data will continue to be split as time goes on. 4. access is through a single program that has exclusive access. 5. the program can accept some setup SQL but needs to run the same when accessing one database or multiple databases.p  pTo view them cohesively I do the following really in a program but command line shown here    sqlite3 DBcurrent.sq3p  blockquote   pattach database DB2006thru2007.sq3 as hist1   attach database DB2008thru2009.sq3 as hist2   create temp view histtbl as            select  from hist1.histtbl union           select  from hist2.histtbl union           select  from main.histtblp blockquote  pThere is now a temp.histtbl view and a main.histtbl table.

Additionally I can always insert into main.histtbl.p  pQuestion 1 What are the downsides Question 2 Is there a better wayp  pThanks in advance.p

But how do I include JQuery or something to generate the widget in script.js p  pWhat I mean is displaywidget  the ID of the widget div will be the name of a php file on my server so essentially script.js will need to load displaywidget.php into the div displaywidget.   p  pI think I use codedocument.getElementByIddisplaywidgetcode to get the div but how do I then writeinsertload displaywidget.php inside the divp  pThinking as I write pure java can do most of what I want i.e. codedocument.getElementByIddisplaywidgetcode, BUT I would prefer to also include Jquery.js as I would like some aspects of the widget to use JQuery. Example being the JQuery UI date function.p  pSorry if I am rambling a bit but trying to think as I go along. My real problem is I am not too sure on pure javascript i.e. getting the div to displayload displaywidget.phpp  pSuggestions please.

Two solutions I considered werep  ol liBuilding my own image gallery.li liStarting default android image gallery using intent.li ol  pstrongSolution 1strong I belive that first solution will take me too much time to developed. I started with a hrefhttpandroidsamples.blogspot.com200906howtodisplaythumbnailsofimages.htmlthis tutoriala but as soon I implemented it I found out that it is running too slow. Then I take a look at android camera a hrefhttpandroid.git.kernel.orgpplatformpackagesappsCamera.gitasummarysource codea to find solution but again I found that it will take me too much time to review the code and to build my own gallery from scratch. I also believe that it is not in Android OS philosophy to rewrite functionalities that already exists but to use Intents to start activities that can handle actions you need. This lead me to second solution.p  pstrongSolution 2strong I tried calling default android gallery using intent in order to browse users device photos by soon I was stuck again. Problem this time was that as soon as user tap on photo, gallery exits and returns to activity that originaly started it, and I expected and I want to start large image preview instead. I saw that others had this problem too a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3864860howtoopengalleryviaintentwithoutresulthow to open gallery via intent without resulta. Because I didnt find the fix for this I decided to quit.p  pMy question is how can I overcome these problems and build gallery that is similar to one I already have for web photos.

Negative 27 pIm developing a Java application that consists of a server and a client possibly multiple clients in future which may run on different hosts.p  pFor communication between these two I currently use a custom protocol which consists of JSON messages that are sent over network sockets and that are converted back to Java Bean objects on both sides.

Negative 27 pI am working on a Symfony application that works mainly with form submissions and our team needed extreme customisation on validations therefore we chose to not use the forms helper and widgets. Now each form has an action method for submission and retrieval. In between one of those forms I need an auto fill but I dont know how I should send this to a new action method on the keyup event and return data from there. I am completely unable to return the data from there I have checked using Firebug. I have found articles that submit the whole form for a search auto fill. I cant do that because my auto fill field is not the only one on the form. Its a city field which I have to give suggestions on. I am expected to use the jQuery framework. Please help.p  pMoreover I dont understand the AJAX concept in Symfony very well. It would be really helpful if you could link me to some good articles.p  pAppreciate all the help. Thanks a lot.p

Negative 27 pI have a Windows service written in C that spawns several worker threads. Those threads are supposed to loop every X minutes until the service is stopped, which works very well in most cases. But, there is one thread that appears to be stopping for no reason. We already have a trycatch block with logging code around the threads entire function, but it never logs any exceptions.p  pIn .NET, is there any way to monitor a thread from another process and record whenwhyhow it stoppedp  h2More detailsh2  pThe code that spawns the thread looks like thisp  precodetry       Create a new thread for processing Incoming Emails     IncomingEmailThread  new Threadnew ThreadStartProcessIncomingEmails     IncomingEmailThread.Start      LogEventService Started, EventLogEntryType.Information  catch Exception e      LogEvente.Message, EventLogEntryType.Error  codepre  pAnd the code inside the thread looks like thisp  precodewhile Closing      try               Wait for 5 minutes before running.

Negative 27 pSo, I have a decent idea of what a delegate does, why use it, how to implement it etc. and Im working on implementing it in one of my projects. The problem Im trying to solve is to decouple my Controller objects from my Network Access class. In this context, the ideas get a little messy in my head.p  pI somehow intuitively feel that the NetworkAccessClass should be the delegate for a Controller object, because the NetworkAccessClass is acting as a helper for the Controller object. But it seems to work in a reverse fashion, because the following is apparently the right way to do itp  pcodeNetworkaccessClass.hcodep  precodeprotocol NetworkAccessDelegate void requestSuccededNSData  data void requestFailedint responseCode end interface NetworkAccessClass  NSObject      idltNetworkAccessDelegategt networkDelegate   propertynonatomic, assign id networkDelegate  void initWithDelegateid delegate   end codepre  pcodeNetworkAccessClass.mcodep  precodeimplementation synthesize networkDelegate  void initWithParamsid delegate      networkDelegate  delegate      Assign GETPOST vals, create request etc     [request startAsynchronous]       void requestSuccededASIHTTPRequest  request      if[networkDelegate respondsToSelectorselectorrequestSucceded]           Send the data to the controller object for it to use         ...        void requestFailedASIHTTPRequest  request       Same as above. Send to request failed.   end  codepre  pAnd finally in my codeFirstViewController.hcodep  precodeimport NetworkAccessClass.h interface FirstViewControllerltNetworkAccessDelegategt    void requestSuccededNSData  data void requestFailedint responseCode end codepre  pAnd the same in codeSecondViewController.hcode and so on.p  pAlthough this does decouple my Controllers from my Network class, I cant help feel its emwrongem because the controllers in this case are acting as delegates or helper methods emtoem the Network Class and not the other way round. Am I missing something basic Or is this how it isp  pThanks, br  Teja.p

Negative 27 pI am involved in a project, where we will basically be receiving data from two or three internal systems that are inside of a school districts firewall, and aggregating and massaging the data for presentation on a website that studentsparents can log in to to see only their specific data. The internal systems are provided by another software vendor, who we have a good working relationship with and will be working with to provide us with an API to the data. We will be getting a snapshot of the data once a day or so. The school district wants our system, but they are concerned about security and privacy of their internal data.  We do not want to host the web application from their servers a nightmare, and so we are going to working with the inside software provider to have them provide us with secure access to the data through the districts firewall.  We will be presenting a proposal to the Districts CIO in a few weeks about how we intend to do this and keep the data safe and private.  p  pSo here is my question p  pCan someone point me in the right direction of what types of APIs are typically used to do this type of secured, private data transfer between two systems one on the inside, one on the outside  For now, the data flow will be onedirectional meaning well only be querying, not updating, and a snapshot of the whole database once a day or so may be good enough.  I would prefer it to require as little configuration by the school districts IT dept as possible and be as simple but useful as possible.   Ive looked at SOAP, REST, SFTP, HTTPS and SSHSOCKS, but am having trouble sorting it all out.  I am sure there is a standard way of doing this type of data batch, so if someone could point me in the right direction or provide some perspective, that would be much appreciated  My expertise is in coding and havent delved a lot into this type of network administration before. p  pBy the way, my app is DjangoPython . . . but we have lots of Java experience so should have some flexibility and power there.p

The code is within an inner class of ShoppingList which is the ListActivity so its probably something wrong with the way that Im calling the getView method.p  precodefor int i  0 i lt adapter.getCount i                                View thisView  adapter.getViewi, ShoppingList.this.getListView.getRootView, ShoppingList.this.getListView                  inflate views                 TextView viewitemname  TextView thisView.findViewByIdR.id.viewitemname                 TextView viewitemchecked  TextView thisView.findViewByIdR.id.viewitemchecked               codepre
Negative 27 pi have a UIWebView on a modal view.

Negative 27 pI want to create the following functionality I want to be able to show an image on a window, if it is provided, or a linear gradient brush if the image is not present. I came up with two approaches p  ol lipTo create a codeBordercode and to apply codeImageBrushcode to the border codeBackgroundcode property if  the image codeUricode is provided, or codeLinearGradientBrushcode if not. This is easy to  implement The view model would supply the border background property either with image  brush or linear gradient brush. But theres one big problem if the image dimensions  dont fit the border size, the image is deformed which is something I wish to avoid. Is  there a way to set codeImageBrushcode and to preserve the image dimensions ratio, i.e. to  apply something like codeStretch  Stretch.Uniformcodepli lipTo create a codeBordercode and an codeImagecode inside of it. Then, to create a data trigger for  the border, and if the image codeUricode a property from the view model is codenullcode, to set  the codeBackgroundcode of the border to codeLinearGradientBrushcode and to leave it blank if otherwise.

Negative 27 pI need to set the class for an element in my page. With plain JavaScript, I would write something likep  precodedocument.getElementByIdfoo.className  myclass codepre  pThis just sets the class, which is exactly what I want. But Im using jQuery on my page and so would like to do this in a jQuery way, since it seems weird to mix the old style and the jQuery style.

Does this mean I have to keep track of the old class and do a removeClass first Is there no way to tell jQuery to replace the current class no matter what it is and just replace it with a new onep

Ive tried Destroy, Ive tried simply delete progScreen, and both, every time Ill close the main frame, the process keeps running, and at some point exits with some astronomical number. The only thing I could think might be relevant, is that the doPartsOfThings methods may call boostthisthreadsleep, because it involves waiting and whatnot down in my model class.

Negative 27 pIm facing troubles while trying to solve a problem that is a harder nut to me than I assumed. Given a binary matrix of NxM, I want to generate all possible solution under the constraint that each column has exactly a single 1. For 2x3, that would bep  precode1 1 0 0 0 0  1 0 0 1 0 0  1 0 0 0 0 1  0 1 1 0 0 0  0 0 1 1 0 0  0 0 1 0 0 1  0 1 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 1 1 0  0 0 0 0 1 1 codepre  pAfter some headaches, I have a recursive algorithm in C working, but Im not too sure if it is correct as it obviously wasnt working for the longest time, missing some combinations. After changing the recursion at least the number of combinations is correct and for N x M that I can manually check it seems correct.p  pBut The memory consumption is terrible as I start with p  precode1 1 0 0 0 0 codepre  pand the rightmost column, setting the 1 to a 0 and the 0 in the line below to a 1, if there is any line. Then I go one column to the left resetting what Ive done to the rightmost column, like considering a carry and iterate the position of the 1, and for each iteration I recurse to the right again until no column is left to iterate its 1. This approach may seem awkward to you the code does to me, but Ive though of it like counting in a polyad system, where the columns are digits and the position of the 1 gives the value of the digit. p  pMaybe its just my broken way of recursing down, but currently I have to copy the current array for each recursion, which is of course terrible, but the only way I found yet, as having e.g.p  precode0 1 1 0 0 0 codepre  pand copying it twice for generating p  precode0 0 1 1 0 0 codepre  pand p  precode0 0 1 0 0 1 codepre  pindepently from each other is easier. But freeing memory in C while recursing down doesnt seem to fit my level of experience. Ive done a rewrite in Java hoping the GC may help me out cant believe it, but it looks like it does but there again, the profiling says of course that copying the data is eating 99 of the cycles.p  pDo you have any suggestions for my problem Is there maybe even a name for that, not to think of existing algorithms Do you have pseudo code for the recursion at hand Thanks a lot from a smoking brainp  pIm not even sure if this is a combinatoric or permutational problem. p

Negative 27 pI have a data source that I use for creating reports in my programme.

The program works fine.p  pNow my problem is this, when I select a table adapter and take a look at its properties, the Connection string is still set to the old connection string name, the connection string value itself is given as Unable to find connection .

Negative 27 pI have a basic MVC setup with helper classes containing utility methods, several of these are likely to be used when loading a view, in both the view itself, the controller and sometimes, but not often, the models.

Negative 27 pI have been tasked with updating our internal framework we use inhouse. One of the things the framework does is you pass it a query and it will return the number of rows the query has in it The framework makes heavy use of DataReaders so we need the total before hand for UI things. p  pThe query that the count needs to be done on can be different from project to project SOLinjection is not a issue, the query is not from user input, just hard coded in from another programmer when they use the framework for their project. and I was told that just having the programmers write a second query for the count is unacceptable.p  pCurrently the solution is to do the following I did not write this, I was just told to fix it.p  precodeexecutes query and returns record count public static int RecordCountstring SqlQuery, string ConnectionString, bool SuppressError  false       SplitLeft is just myString.Substring0, myString.IndexOfpattern with some error checking. and InStr is just a wrapper for IndexOf.     remove order by clause breaks count     if Str.InStr0, SqlQuery.ToLower,  order by  gt 1         SqlQuery  Str.SplitLeftSqlQuery.ToLower,  order by       try              execute query         using SqlConnection cnSqlConnect  OpenConnectionConnectionString, SuppressError         using SqlCommand SqlCmd  new SqlCommandselect count from   SqlQuery   as a, cnSqlConnect                      SqlCmd.CommandTimeout  120             return Int32SqlCmd.ExecuteScalar                   catch Exception ex              if SuppressError  false             MessageBox.Showex.Message, Sql.RecordCount          return 1        codepre  pHowever it breaks on queries like again, not my query, I just need to make it workp  precodeselect [ClientID], [Date], [Balance]  from [Ledger]  where Seq  select top 1 Seq               from [Ledger] as l               where l.[ClientID]  [Ledger].[ClientID]               order by [Date] desc, Seq desc        and Balance ltgt 0 codepre  pas it will removes everything after the codeorder bycode and breaks the query.

We write apps to pull data from a clients old database and move it in to our database format when a customer buys our a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCustomerrelationshipmanagement relnofollowCRMa software. Often we are working with source tables that are poorly written and can be several Gigs in size. We do not have the resources to hold the whole table in memory so we use a DataReader to pull the data out so everything is not in memory at once. However a requirement is a progress bar with the total number of records to be processed. This RecordCount function is used to figure the max of the progress bar. It works fairly well, the only snag is if the programmer writing the conversion needs to order the data output, having a codeorder bycode clause in the outer most query breaks codecountcodep  hr  pstrongPartial Solutionstrong I came up with this while trying to figure it out, it will not work 100 of the time but I think it will be better than the current solutionp  pIf I find a order by clause, I then check to see if the first thing in the query is a select and no Top following I replace that beginning text with codeselect top 100 percentcode.

Negative 27 pIm posting this question to Stackflow bc after doing much research into an answer to this very question online, I did not come across a straight forward answer and had to do my own sleuthwork to resolve this.p  pBasically, Sitecore uses a handler file .ASHX for all files uploaded to the Media Library. Since the 3rd party GA tracking tool I was using entourage.js or gatags.js does not recognize .ashx as a whitelisted download file, it was not adding the appropriate GA tracking syntax to the GA pixel tracker utm.gif. p  pSo the solution turns out to be simple but sadly, not retroactive, meaning all files previously uploaded to the Media Library in the Sitecore content tree will continue to use the ashx extension unless you reupload the image. In your web.config file, search for the Media.RequestExtension setting. If you change the value associated with this setting from ashx to a blank string, this will force Sitecore to use the originalextension of the file and image in the Sitecore Media Library.p  pAside from interfering with GA analytics, this method of turning every downloadable file extension into an ashx file is poor SEO practice. AND, Sitecore will not point you in the right direction of getting around this other than a roundabout way google Sitecore dynamic linking and configuration because they want you to use their Sitecore OMS download tracking capability. And thats it Two days of research led me to this conclusion.p
Negative 27 pWith a PHP MVC project, I have a few model classes that load data from a RESTful web service, which requires an API key.  Id like to store the necessary API key in the central config file of my application.p  pTo get that API key to my class, which method would be considered bestp  ol liPut the value in codeGLOBALScode, so it can be accessed directly within the model classes which utilize it.li liPass the value to the class upon instantiation.li ol  pMethod 2 seems best for OOP and code reuse, but method 1 is very convenient.  I typically go with method 2, but I want to know if method 1 is generally considered to be an acceptable use of codeGLOBALScode, even in an OOP MVC environment.p

Negative 27 psince Im trying to solve this problem for some days, I thought about giving you guys a chance. The situationp  pWere running a SAP Shop with Java Server Pages and Struts in background. We had to disable the HTML Header setable Cache withp  precoderesponse.setHeaderPragma, nocache response.setHeaderCacheControl, nocache response.setHeaderExpires, 0 codepre  pNow what I want to do seemed to us as a simple task but turned out to be more scientific than we expected.p  pWe want to turn autocomplete for IE back on just for the login page. What I and my colleague tried were simple approaches like resetting the header values to various should be caching values like public with expirens tomorrow or sth. Neither did anything give us that autocomplete boxes in IE6 and up.p  pSo does anyone know a method for JUST ONE PAGE in a Struts system to turn the caching amp as we think the autocomplete back onp
Negative 27 pThis program simply is supposed to eliminate duplicates from an array. However, the second for loop in the eliminate method was throwing an out of bounds exception.

Negative 27 pDo you know of a way to interrupt a read from a Java codeInputStreamcode without closing the associated socketp  pHere is the current construction strategy for grabbing a socket input stream and converting to an interruptible DataInputStreamp  precodeInputStream interruptibleInputStream  Channels.newInputStreamChannels.newChannelmConnectionData.getSocket.getInputStream DataInputStream myInterruptibleDIS  new DataInputStreaminterruptibleInputStream codepre  pThis makes use of a codeReadableByteChannelcode which offers a codereadByteBuffercode method with support for a codeClosedByInterruptExceptioncode throwable.p  pThe problem is that calling an interrupt on the thread making codereadcode calls on the codeDataInputStreamcode causes the underlying socket to be closed.p  pFor my context I need the socket to remain open the codereadcode call is awaiting user input which isnt coming, so Im using the interrupt to pass control back to a higher component and then ultimately returning to codereadcode again.p  pId be very grateful if someone could suggest a way to achieve this using JDK inbuilt classes, or perhaps pointing out that its not possible with some information.p  pI understand there are other ways to achieve the same effect, but nevertheless am curious to know whether this approach is feasible.p
Negative 27 pI am new to WF, so please help me understand the following. Lets say I have a Workflow that takes some data as an input, processes it, and returns it back.

Apparently, instantiating a new Workflow for each data item is quite expensive, so first thing that comes into my mind is to create a pool of Workflow instances and execute them in parallel loop Is there a better way to approach such kind of scenariosp

Negative 27 pIm developing an application which queries data from the host, and then inserts them into an SQL database.

So it is possible that sometimes it runs on 50 PCs. p  pI keep getting two types of SQL error messages. The first is time out, and the other is SSL security error. Right now my application executes about 510 SQL commands. So im thinking to rewrite my code to call stored procedures which could reduce the number of SQL calls. The only question is that is it worth it I mean of course, it has its advantages, because if i have to change something then it is enough to change the stored procedure, and i dont have to recompile my application. But wont that cause trouble for the SQL server I mean isnt that a problem when the same stored procedure will be executed 50 times at the same timep  pSo what way is better Using stored procedures, or using SQL commands in my codep  pThanksp

Changing the origin to the center to scale it fixes this, but presents new problems with rotation and flipping.p

Duncan issued a bugfixed version of the package 3.920 that consolidated certain aspects of parsing XML and HTML and features an improved garbage collection where its not necessary anymore to explicitly free the object containing the external pointer via codefreecode. You find the source code and a Windows binary at Duncans a hrefhttpwww.omegahat.orgRSXMLOmegahat websitea.p  hr  h2EDIT 20120213 233400h2  pUnfortunately, the new package version still does not seem to fix the issues Im encountering in the little little example that Ive put together.

Ive included a logical switch in the example codedo.forcefreecode in script code.scriptsmemory.Rcode that, if set to codeTRUEcode, will do just that. Unfortunately, this made my R console crash. Itd be great if someone could verify this on their machine Actually, the doc strongshouldstrong be freed automatically when using the latest version of XML see above. The fact that it isnt seems to be a bug according to Duncan.p  hr  h2EDIT 20120214 231200h2  pDuncan pushed yet another version of XML 3.921 to his Omegahat website a hrefhttpwww.omegahat.orgRSXMLOmegahat websitea.

Negative 27 pI have an homemade javascript which, among other things, do some kind of textformatting work in order to emulate a retro textbased gamep  pWhen developing it, i tried to stick close to an MVC model, and this is what i didp  pThe data model basically consists of a list of objects mapping strings to very specific locations in the display, like thisp  precode[  valueHello,  colorblue,  row1,  column13 ,   valueWhat is your quest ,  colorred,  row5,  column10 ,   ... some other data ] codepre  pThen my view consists of a simple codeltpregtcode tag. When my controller draws the model on the view, it iterates through each stringlocation pair and create a codeltspangtcode for each one that is appended to the codeltpregtcode tag.

A simple validation function was throwing an error but upon catching it, only res.end was called.

In this case, inserting a return stops execution immediately after sending the JSON message to the client.p  precodeif .isEmptyreq.body      res.endJSON.stringifyErrorPOST required    suppose return is needed here as well   return  else          try      if .hasreq.body, id        id  parseIntreq.body[id]      else        throw ErrorMissing param in req.body                 end if    catcherr            res.endJSON.stringifyErrorMissing keys,Keys.keysreq.body      without a return here, the code below this do some more work would       be executed     return   end else  do some more work  without the above returns the code would  a make a database call  b call res.end again lt bad.  codepre

Negative 27 pIm a developer for a company has a rather large legacy application written in VB6.  This application was originally developed to be run stand alone, but over the years we began offering a hosting solution to our customers.p  pRight now we are trying to perform damage control until we can replace the application with a more enterprise friendly solution.  Currently our major issue is printing.  In the current implementation, each application server must have a all of the customers printers installed onto the servers as well as the necessary drivers.  Our IS department has several other complaints about this method of printing, but anyone who has used VB6s Printer object probably already knows them all.p  pWhat I would like to do is move the printing functionality to a web service, and modify the legacy application to call the service instead of handling the printing on the app server.  It seems to me that instead of rewriting all of the printing code that is scattered across the project not my project, please no flames  is to print to an xps document, and then transfer that document to the web service.p  pThe problem is that we are still using Win2k for some of my application servers this is not my call, and is equally frustrates me because most of my new development still has to be done in .NET 2.0.  Ive searched around for a solution, but I couldnt find any.  Also, the XPS Essentials pack does not appear to support Win2k.p  pSo, my question is two partsp  ol lipIs there any way to print to an XPS document from Win2kpli lipAre there any glaring flaws in my implementationpli ol  pSorry for the lengthy post.

Negative 27 pIm pretty much new to StackOverflow so please forgive any signs of my ignorance. p  pI have a somewhat minor issue with an MVC application in Visual Studio 2010 Controllers written in C.  I want to create a method which generates an application action history and for that purpose I want to get the name of the controller and action that are used each time. Unfortunately the first letter of the string which holds my controller name is always missing. I used this codep  precode    string url  HttpContext.Current.Request.RawUrl     RouteData route  RouteTable.Routes.GetRouteDatanew OwnedContexturl     var values  route.Values     string controllerName  values[controller].ToString     string actionName  values[action].ToString codepre  pWhere OwnedContext is defined like this p  precode    private class OwnedContext  HttpContextBase              private readonly HttpRequestBase mockHttpRequestBase          public OwnedContextstring appRelativeUrl                      this.mockHttpRequestBase  new OwnedRequestappRelativeUrl                   public override HttpRequestBase Request                      get  return mockHttpRequestBase                codepre  pThe action name is stored correctly but when i debug this code i see that the controllerName string holds the name of the controller but the first Capital letter is always missing, even though the url string holds a value with this pattern controlleraction. p  pI will appreciate any pointers, code examples or an explanation why this happens. If my description is not accurate let me know, I will improve it.p  pThanks in advance p  pEDIT SOLUTION FOUNDp  pFound the problem sort of There was something wrong with OwnedContext defined in my original question. At first I used routeValueDictionary as HarHaHu suggested but the original problem persisted, until I placed httpContext as GetRouteDatas parameterp  precode    string url  HttpContext.Current.Request.RawUrl     RouteData route  RouteTable.Routes.GetRouteDatahttpContext     UrlHelper urlHelper  new UrlHelpernew RequestContexthttpContext, route      var routeValueDictionary  urlHelper.RequestContext.RouteData.Values     string controllerName  routeValueDictionary[controller].ToString     string actionName  routeValueDictionary[action].ToString codepre  pWhere httpContext has a custom getterp  precode    public new HttpContextBase httpContext              get                      HttpContextWrapper context                  new HttpContextWrapperSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current             return HttpContextBasecontext               codepre  pThis way I omitted the OwnedContext and finally got my controllers full name for example Furniture and not urniture.p  pThanks for the tips.  Hope this helps someone. Good luckp

So is it possible Will it make my app go slower not the first time, but the rest because I am retrieving data from SDp

Negative 27 pFor a client I am building a multistep form in PHP5. On one of the first pages there are multiple file uploads. The uploaded files must be stored in a temporary directory until the user completes the form. At the moment all form data will be temporally saved in a Session with an unique number. I thought of storing the files in a session, but this will probably cause errors because an maximal size error.p  pAnother method I thought about was to store the files in the temporary directorytmpname. But the problem of this method is that the temporary folder can be cleared by the os at any time. When that happens the files are lost.p  pThe ideal solution would be that when the form is complete the files are moved to their permanent directorythis is not hard to do. And when the session is expired due to inactivity the files are removed from their temporally directoryto reduce unused space.p  pWhat would be the best way to make this I.e. are there buildin features etc.p

Negative 27 pI would like to multiply two large sparse matrices.  The first is 150,000x300,000 and the second is 300,000x300,000.  The first matrix has about 1,000,000 nonzero items and the second matrix has about 20,000,000 nonzero items.  Is there a straightforward way to get the product of these matricesp  pIm currently storing the matrices in csr or csc format and trying codematrixa  matrixbcode. This gives the error codeValueError array is too bigcode.p  pIm guessing I could store the separate matrices on disk with pytables, pull them apart into smaller blocks, and construct the final matrix product from the products of many blocks.  But Im hoping for something relatively simple to implement.p  pEDIT  Im hoping for a solution that works for arbitrarily large sparse matrices, while hiding or avoiding the bookkeeping involved in moving individual blocks back and forth between memory and disk.p

Negative 27 pIm trying to create a function that moves images arranged in a radial layout around in a circle by swapping each ones position with their neighbors position. The final effect is that the images are rotating around in a circle. The transform is activated when the S counterclockwise or D clockwise keys are pressed. Im using an array to track the positions of the images and sending those coordinates to a function that actually does the transform. p  pThe first rotation in either direction works fine. But any consecutive rotation in the same direction produces strange unwanted movement. In essence, with every new rotation the images all move inward towards the center of the circle before moving out again to take their final positions. The amount of inward motion gets worse with each key press. p  pSince Im not allowed to attach an image to this email I have posted one here  a hrefhttpi1266.photobucket.comalbumsjj532ikalscreencap.jpg relnofollowhttpi1266.photobucket.comalbumsjj532ikalscreencap.jpgap  pThe image shows a series of screenshots to illustrate the phenomenon.

Negative 27 pIm having trouble figuring out why my JavaScript is not working right.  Its with j Query and its supposed to select all the text area tags and then for each text area count the number of characters typed in them and then not allow the user to enter any more after it hits the max length, also showing a character counter under each text area box.  What its doing is only showing the characters remaining but not decrementing after each key pressed and also not stopping when it hits the max length. It also doesnt select all of the text areas, it only takes the first one it finds.p  pHere is my TextAreaCounter.jsp  precodedocument.readyfunction var texts  textarea[maxlength] texts.eachfunction   var this  this,   max  this.attrmaxlength,   textId  thisattr.id,   parent  this.parent,   countId  textIdcount  div  ltdivgtCharacters Remaining ltdivgt.addClasscountdown.insertAfterthis input  ltinputgtltinputgt.attr     typetext,     readOnly readOnly,     value max,     id countId     .css       width 25px       marginTop 5px       marginBottom 10px     .addClassreadOnly.appendTodiv  this.on   keyup function     val  this.val,     countVal  countId.val,     ifval.length gt max        this.valval.substr0,max       alertMax length exceeded  max       return false     else       countId.valmaxval.length        ,   blur function     valthis.val     ifval.length gt max       this.valval.substr0,max       alertMax length exceeded  max       return false     else       countId.valmaxval.length              codepre  pWhen i added some alerts, not shown in the code here, it showed that it was not getting to the this.on section with the keyup event.  I included this external js file to a jsp file which my page is made and has my text areas in. I also add an id and maxlength attribute to the textarea element. Any help would be great thank you.     p

Negative 27 pIm attempting to use KnockoutJS and jQuery UI Sortable together.  I know this has been done before particularly, a hrefhttpsgithub.comrniemeyerknockoutsortable relnofollowknockoutsortablea, but my use case has some pretty specific behavior and Im hoping to avoid trying to make the switch.p  pAnyway, the problem is pretty straightforward  after moving a DOM element with jQuery UI Sortable, Knockout behaves strangely when removing the observableArray element bound to that DOM element.  It will fail to remove the moved element, and if the element that fell into the moved elements place is removed, it will remove both that and the originally moved element. Hard to put into words, but demonstrated by a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjoelhowardvgrTY3 relnofollowthis fiddlea.p  pThe problem seems actually take place in the following block in knockout2.1.0.jsp  precodefunction fixUpVirtualElementscontiguousNodeArray       Ensures that contiguousNodeArray really is an array of contiguous siblings, even if some of the interior      ones have changed since your array was first built e.g., because your array contains virtual elements, and      their virtual children changed when binding was applied to them.      This is needed so that we can reliably remove or update the nodes corresponding to a given array item      if contiguousNodeArray.length gt 2           Build up the actual new contiguous node set         var current  contiguousNodeArray[0], last  contiguousNodeArray[contiguousNodeArray.length  1], newContiguousSet  [current]         while current  last              current  current.nextSibling             if current  Wont happen, except if the developer has manually removed some DOM elements then were in an undefined scenario                 return             newContiguousSet.pushcurrent                    ... then mutate the input array to match this.          The following line replaces the contents of contiguousNodeArray with newContiguousSet         Array.prototype.splice.applycontiguousNodeArray, [0, contiguousNodeArray.length].concatnewContiguousSet       codepre  pThis call is adding the moved DOM element to the list of elements to be removed when the shifted element is removed.p  pSo an open call to any jQuery UI  Knockoutjs geniuses  is there a way to resolve this conflict, or do I need to do something entirely different to make these tools play nicely togetherp

Negative 27 pI am a novice objective c programmer with a good amount of experience with other OO languages.  p  pCurrently I am working on a calculator that involves some unit conversion.  My initial thought was to have a two abstract classes emMeasurementem and emUnitem.  Subclasses of Unit would be things like emMeterem, emKilogramem, emSecondem, etc.  These classes would contain information about the multiplier to some base unit probably the SI units as well as some information useful to the UI like label and description.  Subclasses of Measurement would be things like emLengthem, emMassem, emTimeem, etc.  These classes would contain the value and unit of the measurement as well as the methods necessary to determine allowed conversions and conduct the conversions.p  pI am starting to have questions like How do I have only one Meter class shared by any Length class that needs it and How do I store a list of allowed units per measurement that is common to any measurement of that type This is leading me to believe that I may be overengineering my class hierarchy.  I was wondering if anyone had suggestions on different architectures to accomplish this task or perhaps language features that a novice may be unaware of that may help with my implementation.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 27 pI need to process a bunch of very large XML files and read each element depthfirst. Due to size, any codeDOMcode solution is out of question and things are further complicated by the fact that the actual element needed is not the leaf but its parent.p  pMore specifically, the files have a structure likep  precode    ltLevel 1gt         ...         ltLevel 2gt             ...             ltLevel N1gt                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt                 ...                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt             ltLevel N1gt             ltLevel N1gt                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt                 ...                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt             ltLevel N1gt             ...             ltLevel N1gt                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt                 ...                 ltvaluegt...ltvaluegt             ltLevel N1gt             ...         ltLevel 2gt     ltLevel 1gt codepre  pOut of each file like the above, the codeltLevel N1gtcode elements need to be read individually each including all the corresponding codeltvaluegtcode elements. The depth, codeNcode, varies within each file and across files, so it is essentially unknown, as are codeXMLcode tag names. Things are further complicated by the fact that codeltvaluegtcode elements also exist in higher levels i.e., they constitute no guarantee that codeLevel Ncode has been reached.p  pA quick solution for reading an entire XML element at a specific depth as a string is something likep  precodeint level  0   The base level of the element, could be at any depth Reader in  ...

Negative 27 pThere have been a few questions on how to implement enums in Python. Most solutions end up being more or less equivalent to something like thisp  precodeclass Animal     DOG1     CAT2 codepre  pOthers have suggest more complicated ways of constructing enums, but ultimatly the tend to look like this example when all is said and done.p  pBased on my experience in Java and C, I can think of all sorts of uses for such an idiom. However, it doesnt seem to be very Pythonic. In fact, it seems that every time somebody asks why there arent enums in Python you tend to get a bit of a groan with canned responses about how there is no reason to try and enforce compile time type safety in a language like Python, or how designs which require enums are bad smells in Python.p  pMy question is not how to implement enums in Python, but how in general people approach solutions to problems that lend themselves to enums in a Pythonic way. In other words, how would you solve a problem which lends itself to having a data type with a discrete set of possible values without porting your JavaC solution to Python.p

Negative 27 pTo enable custom user preferences during publishing we would like to find out in the resolve step inside a custom resolver what the publishing user is so not the user account configured for the Publisher service but the user that initiated the publish operation.p  pTo find the original publishing user we would need to have access to the PublishTransaction object specifically the Creator property we cannot use the User property from the Session inside the custom resolver as this Session is created by the Publisher service and would give us the service account.p  pTo find the current PublishTransaction a hrefhttpyatb.mitza.net201203getcurrentpublishtransaction.html relnofollowMihai has provided us with an excellent hacka.

For this reason we publish the marker component which will resolve all linked components and ultimately pages and the custom resolver allowed us to push the TCMURI of the marker component into the session cache making it accessible in the CT.p  pNow we want to set a preference for a specific marker component at a user level to allow smaller batches of assets to be published within this marker context as opposed to publishing everything linked to the marker at once.p  pBecause the TBBs running inside the CT actually DO have an Engine object available, we can use Mihais method and determine the publishing user as opposed to pushing the marker context from the resolver what we initially did and in this way bypass the issue completely.p  pI was wondering why there is such a difference in information availability between a resolve and a render operation both are afterall part of the same publishing context. I cannot help but feel Im overlooking something very basic but maybe Im not and accessing a publishing context or engine from the resolver is simply impossible.p  hr  pEdit as presumed by Dominic and confirmed by Nuno there is no Engine at the time of resolving as such this half of my question has been answered.

I have an implicit rule like thisp  precodebuilda.o  srca.cpp   CXX I srca OTHERFLAGS o  lt codepre  pIf a file under a tries to include a header file from b or c, the build fails as the header is not found.p  pThe second rule has a similar rule, which specifies srca and srcb as include directories.

Negative 27 pThis question was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq41467161982048asked and answered back in 2010a but when I follow the directions of the venerable Mr. Buggabill and then run the macro by editing the target cell Excel promptly crashes. The code looks like thisp  precodePrivate Sub WorksheetChangeByVal target As Range     If target.Address  A1 Then         ActiveWorkbook.WorksheetsSheet2.Rangetarget.Address.Value  target.Value     End If End Sub codepre  pI created one version of the macro under Sheet1 which pushes the target value to A1 on Sheet2 and another version of the macro under Sheet2 which does the reverse. With only one macro in place this works fine but my intent is to be able to enter a value on either sheet and have the new value propagated into both input cells. Excel crashes because its a circular reference, right Is there a way around thisp

Negative 27 pIve been trying to figure this out, and I sort of have a work around but I just wanted to check that Im not missing something obvious. Basically, I have a series of commands that follow certain rules. Anything containing a digit, ASCII letter, or certain symbols is a token and lt,,,ampamp,,etc are delimiters. I need to be able to tell which one I just found and store them in an array. p  pSo in a while loop I havep  precodea  sscanf cp, [09azAZ., ], str codepre  pIve included a space as one of the symbols to look for since I couldnt figure out any other way. Instead, after I get the word plus nay possible spaces I callp  precode delimiters[]     token  strtokstr, delimiters codepre  pWhich should remove the whitespace, leaving me with just a token and if there was no space, it just doesnt change the word. Im just curious if theres a way to do something similar with sscanf, since I know that it already breaks up strings if theres a whitespace between them, but if you call it again and it sees the whitespace, it just doesnt read anything.p  pIf not, thats fine too. Its just been bugging my all day.p

Negative 27 pHere is a question Ive been trying to solve since quite some time ago. This does not attain a particular languaje, although its not really beneficial for some that have a VM that specifies endianess. I know, like the 99.9999 of people that use sockets to send data using TCPIP, that the protocol specifies a endianess for the transmission elements, like destination address, port and such. The thing I dont know is strongif it requires the payload to be in a specific format to prevent incompatibilitiesstrong. p  pFor example, lets say I develop a protocol that is not a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPresentationLayer relnofollowpresentation layera, and that I, due to the inmense dominance that little endian devices have nowadays, decide to make it little endian for example the positions of the players and such are transmitted in little endian order. For example a network module for a game engine, where latencies matter and byte conversion would cost a noticeable amount of time. Of course the address, port and all of that data that is protocol related would be specified in big endian as is mandatory, Im talking about the payload, and only that.p  pWould that protocol work out of the box translating the contents as necessary, of course, once the the transmission is received on a big endian machine Or would the checksums of the IP protocol or something of the kind get computed wrong since the data is in a different order, and the programmer does not have control of them if rawsockets arent usedp  pSince the whole explanation can be misleading, feel free to ask for clarifications.p  pThank you very much.p
Negative 27 pSo Im going to be using CakePHP for an upcoming project. I have been researching the ways that an hMVC structure could be applied to the Cake framework.

Essentially, I want to update some data, conditionally, then copy all the nodes that were not updated.

Negative 27 pI have been tinkering with making a drawing application in Gosu using Ruby, but am running into some high CPU usage. I know one possible cause. p  pFirst, I am simply adding a primitive to an hash every time the user clicks the mouse button or if they hold down the mouse button, every time the screen refreshes, which I think happen around 60 times per second. Each time the screen redraws I have the program loop through the hash and redraw all the primitives. If someone holds down their mouse button it will just keep overlapping primitives on top of each other and in other situations the primitives just layer. I can see how that would eventually eat up a bunch of memory in the hash.p  pI feel that the best solution would be to use some sort of lower level function that simply colors pixels on the screen and doesnt have to store them in an hash. Im not sure if Gosu supports that.

Negative 27 pI am wondering if MQ can be used as a state cache for monitoring And is this a good idea or notp  pIn theory you can have many sources monitoring agents that detect problem states and distribute them to subscribers via an MQ system such as RabbitMQ. But has anyone heard of using MQ systems to cache the state, so when clients initialize, they read from the state queue before subscribing to new state messages Is that a bad way to use MQp  pSo to recap, a monitor would read current state from a state queue then setup a subscription queue to receive any new updates. And the state queue would be maintained by removing any alerts that are no longer valid by the monitoring agents that put the alert there to begin with.p  pAdvantage would be decentralized notification and theoretically very salable by adding more mq systems to relay events. p

Negative 27 pIm trying to write a function which gets string as its argument, searches if there is p or e in it, splits it onto separate strings, replaces empem with em3.14...em and emeem with em2.71...em, converts all strings onto double and then multiplies all converted strings. For example, when argument is em123.45p4e9.2em, function splits it onto em123.45em, empem, em4em, emeem and em9.2em, then replaces characters with constants em123.45em, em3.14...em, em4em, em2.71...em and em9.2em, after that converts all of them onto double and multiplies 123.453.1442.719.2 .p  pThe problem is that when I give it a string with only a number, without any p or e for example em2.4em or em32em, it returns 0. However, when I give it emeem, empem, or emepem, it returns em2.71...em, em3.14...em or em8.53...em, so in that in this case it works well. The problem is back, when I try to give it string with combination of numbers and characters. When I enter em3pem, function returns correct result em9.42...em. On the other side, when I enter emp3em, it returns 3.14... although it should still be em9.42...em. It looks like it simply doesnt work with numbers and if there appears e or p, it doesnt seem to discover numbers after first character.p  pCould someone look on the code and find out, where the problem is Ive been trying to find it for hours, but on logical side everything seems to be OK.p  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltiostreamgt include ltconio.hgt include ltstringgt include ltmath.hgt include ltwindows.hgt  define NULL       null  using namespace std  double stalestring w  int main  Testing the function  string liczba cout ltlt Type the number  cin gtgt liczba  double wynik  staleliczba  cout ltlt endl ltlt Result  ltlt wynik ltlt endl ltlt endl systemPAUSE     double stalestring w  string wartosc  new string[w.length]     Dynamic string array  forint i  0 i lt w.length i          String array is filled with null     wartosc[i]  NULL             Bracket only to control lifespawn of liczba and elementwartosc variables string liczba  NULL            Therell be built a number between e and p int elementwartosc  0  forint i  0 i lt w.length i          Searching argument string for e and p     switchw[i]     case p         ifliczba  NULL                   Ends generating number, which isnt e or p             wartosc[elementwartosc]  liczba             liczba  NULL             elementwartosc             wartosc[elementwartosc]  3.14159265358979323846             elementwartosc         else         wartosc[elementwartosc]  3.14159265358979323846         elementwartosc                  break     case e         ifliczba  NULL                   Ends generating number, which isnt e or p             wartosc[elementwartosc]  liczba             liczba  NULL             elementwartosc             wartosc[elementwartosc]  2.71828182845904523536             elementwartosc         else         wartosc[elementwartosc]  2.71828182845904523536         elementwartosc                  break     default         if liczba  NULL             liczba  w[i]                        Starts filling liczba variable with first character         else ifw[i]  0              wartosc[elementwartosc]  liczba    Ends generating number on argument string end             break         else             liczba  liczba  w[i]               Builds the number                   double wynik  0                              There will be the result  forint i  0 i lt w.length i     ifwartosc[i]  NULL                    wartosc array was filled earlier with null strings, to distinguish it from entered numbers         continue     else         double liczba  stodwartosc[i]      Converting strings onto doubles         ifwynik  0             wynik  liczba                    Starting multiplification         else             wynik  liczba                   Multiplification                 delete[] wartosc      Removing dynamic array return wynik          The result is returned  codepre

FROM v  INNER JOIN    SELECT lat, lng   FROM v   GROUP BY lat, lng   HAVING COUNT gt 1    AS vg   USING lat, lng ORDER BY name  codepre  pOutputsp  precodeID  LAT LNG L   NAME 1   12  12  a   group11 2   12  12  b   group12 4   13  13  d   group21 5   13  13  e   group22 6   13  13  f   group23 7   10  13  g   group31 8   10  13  h   group32 9   11  12  h   group41 10  11  12  h   group42 11  10  14  i   group51 12  10  14  j   group52 13  10  14  j   group53 codepre  pWorks well so far, all but the single1 rows are selected and ordered by group.p  pNow I want to add a limit to form different pages of this data. But all rows of the same group need to be on the same page but not one page per group and it doesnt matter how many rows actually are on one page  just not too many. I dont see this done with a LIMIT statement, so I started to write my ownp  precodeSET grp  0, lastlat  , lastlng    SELECT  FROM   SELECT v.,   grp  IFlastlat  lat ampamp lastlng  lng, grp, grp  1 AS grp,   lastlat  lat AS llat,   lastlng  lng AS llng  FROM v   INNER JOIN     SELECT lat, lng    FROM v    GROUP BY lat, lng    HAVING COUNT gt 1     AS vg    USING lat, lng   ORDER BY lat, lng  AS vv WHERE grp BETWEEN 0 AND 7 ORDER BY grp  codepre  pThis query whit out the WHERE part outputs this datap  precodeID  LAT LNG L   NAME        GRP LLAT    LLNG 1   12  12  a   group11    6   12  12 2   12  12  b   group12    6   12  12 5   13  13  e   group22    7   13  13 6   13  13  f   group23    7   13  13 4   13  13  d   group21    7   13  13 7   10  13  g   group31    8   10  13 8   10  13  h   group32    8   10  13 10  11  12  h   group42    9   11  12 9   11  12  h   group41    9   11  12 13  10  14  j   group53    10  10  14 11  10  14  i   group51    10  10  14 12  10  14  j   group52    10  10  14 codepre  pThe idea is to change the values in the line WHERE grp BETWEEN 0 AND 7 for each page. But the numbers from the group dont start at 1 and I cant see why and that makes it unusable for the first page. The Start number is different depending on how many group are in the whole data. So what I need to have, is that the grp column start whit 1 and then continues whit always 1.p  pWhat is wrong with this query and are there any better ways to do thisp  pYou can play whit this query here a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com886d3c2 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com886d3c2ap
Negative 27 pId like my android device to connect to a wifi hotspot. I created a new codewificonfigurationcode and add it into the codewifimanagercode, this codewificonfigurationcode has codeNetworkIdcode.Then I invoke the function codewifi.enableNetworkNetworkId, true.codep  pAfter that, I think the supplicant will go through obtaining ip address, authentication, and at last physically connect to the hotspot.  So is there a way to identify if the wifi is physically connected or notp  pI would prefer a handlerlike method.p

Negative 27 pI have seen similar questions a lot on Stackoverflow and I tried a lot of things but I cant seem to figure this out. I have multiple TableViewControllers and 1 MainViewController. The MainViewController has buttons calling the different TableViewControllers and on selecting a tablecell the tableViewController dismisses. p  pThe problem is that im pushing a new instance of my MainViewController every time I push from either one of my tableViewControllers. I currently use Segues to push between these different controllers.p  pIn short When switching from TableViewControllers to ViewController I want to prevent the ViewController to get pushed as a new instance because this way its removing my previous data input.p  pIm pretty sure I have to use eitherp  precode[self dismissModalViewController withCompletion] performSegue prepareForSegue codepre  pOr set some global variables in a class and call those, but im not experienced enough yet to implement this correctly.p  pA simple example of end result would be 3 textfields in VC. On clicking textfield1 it opens tableview1 and on clicking a cell it updates textfield1. Textfield2 opens tableview2, etc.p  pHope im clear enough, could post sample code if needed.p  pEdit, posting code keep in mind, segues are performed in storyboard TableViewExample.hp  precodeinterface IndustryViewController  UIViewController ltUITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSourcegt   NSArray tableViewArray property nonatomic, strong IBOutlet UITableView tableViewIndustry codepre  pTableViewExample.mp  precode voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender  if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringshowIndustry]      NSIndexPath indexPath  [self.tableViewIndustry indexPathForSelectedRow]     ViewController destViewController  segue.destinationViewController     destViewController.industryText  [tableViewArray objectAtIndexindexPath.row]     destViewController.industryTextName  [tableViewArray objectAtIndexindexPath.row]  codepre  pThen in ViewController.m, viewDidLoadp  precode [industry setTitleindustryText forStateUIControlStateNormal] codepre  pThese are the most important parts I think.p

Negative 27 pI need some advice how to handle the following case. Im saving an object graph within core data. For simplicity lets say i have a User object name, age, adress. Adress is another object with some properties. Now the User can change his Adress. If he changes it i need to remember these changes for the next order. After that i need to revert back to the original Adress. The User can also revert back at any time. Where should i save these temporary changes I thought about adding a new entity like ChangedData but this somehow does not feel right. Basicly i need to remember the original object and if the User changes it i need to remember those for some Time as well. I hope i could express my problem well enough.p
Negative 27 pI am new to IoC and Repository Pattern. I was able to do some test project and it works. But, I am not so sure if what I implemented is a good practice. The test project I have created have all the repositories in place as well as a working interface with a dummy data. But what I want is that my project should not be able to know the concrete types of my models because the initial version should be implemented using MSSQL, and the second version would be a mix of MSSQL and NoSQLfor reads and logging.

In summary heres what I didp  p1 add the following to plugins.sbtp  precodeaddSbtPluginorg.scalastyle  scalastylesbtplugin  0.3.1  resolvers  sonatypereleases at httpsoss.sonatype.orgcontentrepositoriesreleases codepre  p2 add the following line in build.sbtp  precodeorg.scalastyle.sbt.ScalastylePlugin.Settings codepre  p3 add the file scalastyleconfig.xml to the root directory of the project.p  pSo now when I go to the sbt console, I can run scalastyle and I get the output file scalastyleresult.xml in .target.p  pBUT the file only contains thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltcheckstyle version5.0gtltcheckstylegt codepre  pSo basically it is not raising any warnings. Now no need to mention that I do have a few classes in my project. But I am unable to distinguish whether the results xml is valid or not. I assume there should at least be a few warnings.p  pIve previously done some work with checkstyle which is quite similar, and in the ant target I got to specify the directory that checkstyle should be looking into. Is it similar with scalastylep  pThanks a lot for the help.p

Negative 27 pI have a form that gets from the user min size and max size of a shoe and prints on the same page by POST method all of the shoes with this size range.p  pThe form action is leading to the same page so the page is kinda refreshed and gets new values for the POSTs variables.p  pMy problem is that the default select option for examplep  precodeltoption value49.0 selectedselectedgt49.0ltoptiongt codepre  pis still selected of course after page refreshed so it prints the results for X size but the option that is selected is 49.0p  pMy question is how can I change the default option to the one that the user choosed before he submited the form or in other words to POST[minSize] and POST[maxSize]p

For example, the text file I had readbr line 1br line 2br line 3  p  pwhich would have printed outbr line 3br line 2br line 1  p  pand it does, so whats the real problem This question is not so much about fixing the functionality of some code I had a little help in writing but more about understanding the code and the logic behind  what it does and how it accomplishes it.  p  pI am very new to C been learning for a few days so please dont scream if I dont understand something relatively simple.p  pTHE QUESTION  p  pIn the first while loop I have allocated memory blocks large enough to store a structtype line and defined the pointer l1 of type line to hold the address of this allocated memory. Now heres the problem. On the line of code below this another memory block is allocated for a string with a buffer large enough to hold the size of each string read in the text file whose pointer is defined as l1lines.  p  pTo me this seems illogical as l1 was defined only to be a pointer of type line but on the second row of this while loop the l1lines suggests that I have declared a struct of the type line named l1 and I am accessing one of its members lines and am assigning the address of this struct member as the address of the newly allocated memory block. This means that l1 is a pointer to both a struct and also a pointer to a memory block.  p  pFrom all this I can clearly say that my understanding of what is happening is skewed and is by no means correct.

Negative 27 pI need to design a record with an unconstrained string that has this effect below. Right now that type does not synthesize because of a codeType for a record element may not be an unconstrained arraycode error.p  precodetype typetextChunk is record     text string     color stdlogicvector7 downto 0  111 amp 111 amp 11 end record type typetextPassage is arraynatural range ltgt of typetextChunk  codepre  pThis way I can have a text block with multiple sections of variable length and color in it.

You can find it on a hrefhttpsgithub.comMadLittleModsFPVGAText relnofollowGitHub under the name FPVGATexta. It currently uses a generic on the component which defines the length of the string but is not suitable to draw a sentence of multiple colors easily manual positioning of multiple components could mimic this effect, although painstakingp  pI understand that infinite hardware is not possible but I want this to be reusable and generic as possible in order to suit everyones needs.

Negative 27 pI am making an codeinfix evaluatorcode in which the legal tokens include , , , , , , nonnegative integers, and any String that begins with one or more letters and ends with one or more digits.p  pI am trying to find the most efficient way to determine if a given String begins with one or more letters and ends with one or more digits. The catch is that the codealphabetical characaters must come before the numerical valuescode e.g. X1, XX1, X11. However, if the String contains something similar to 1X, X1X, X1, then the input is invalid.I know this encloses many possibilities, and I hope there is a way to simplify it. p  pThus far I have researched methods such as the Strings a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb534972.aspx relnofollowemcodeAnycodeema, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybaketfxw.aspx relnofollowemcodeStartsWithcodeema, and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary2333wewz.aspx relnofollowemcodeEndsWithcodeema functions. I just feel like there are too many possibilities to simplify this into a short lambda expression or oneliner. In fact, since we arent necessarily guaranteed any kind of input, it seems that all N characters would have to be check in order to ensure that the these conditions be met.p  pBelow is the code that I have thus far. This code includes breaking the input String up based on the RegularExpression code[]codep  precode    public static string[] parseStringString infixExp               In a legal expression, the only possible tokens are , ,            , , , , nonnegative integers, and strings that begin            with one or more letters and end with one or more digits.                     Ignore all whitespace within the expression.         infixExp  Regex.ReplaceinfixExp, s, String.Empty           Seperate the expression based on the tokens , , , ,           , , and ignore any of the empty Strings that are added          due to duplicates.         string[] substrings  Regex.SplitinfixExp, [].Wheres gt s  String.Empty.ToArray           Return the resulting substrings array such that it          can be processed by the Evaluate function.         return substrings      codepre  pIf you have any suggestive approaches andor any references such that I could solve this issue, please feel freep

Negative 27 pI have a small problem, I have created some Selenium tests. The problem is I cant order the testcases I have created. I know unit testing should not be ordered but this is what I need in my situation. I have to follow these steps login first, create a new customer, change some details about the customer and finally log out. p  pSince there is no option to order unit tests in NUnit I cant execute this.p  pI already tried another option, to create a unittest project in Visual Studio, because Visual Studio 2012 has the ability to create a ordered unit test. But this is not working because I cant run a unit test while I am running my ASP.NET project. Another solution file is also not a good option because I want to verify my data after it has been submitted by a Selenium test.p  pDoes someone of you have another solution to solve my problemp

How can I get this table to display correctlyp  pEDIT to clarify, the reason I used COALESCE was because the donation table has nothing in it until someone donates something. Therefore the equation doesnt compute as the values in the donations table are null at first.p  pEDIT 2 I guess the question then becomes, when should I COALESCE in this situationp

Negative 27 pThe overall goal to my project is to gather current emergency incident information from multiple 911 dispatch centers and send that info via a webservice to our server, which will then display a list of emergency incidents for our region.  The way I am currently gathering data at each dispatch center is thisp  ul liThe dispatch center has some kind of database server running that stores all of the incident informationli liI have a query set up in the database that returns all of the current emergency incidents in xml formatli liI have a windows service that, every 3 seconds, runs that query actually a stored procedure, then sends that data xml to our webserviceli liWhen our server receives the information, it deletes from our database, not the dispatch center all the current incident information and replaces it with the new datali ul  pThe problem with this approach is that we are send tons and tons of redundant data.  What I would like to do is only send database rows that have changed since the last time the sproc was run.  My thinking is to have my windows service do something like this.. run the sproc and store the results in an arraydictionary of some kind. The next time the sproc is run 3 seconds later is to compare the new results with the existing array and only pull out the differences and send them...  would like to send the data to our webservice as JSON instead of XML... wondering what ideas people have to best accomplish this not necessarily specific code, but more of an overview...  Using C...p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter some more investigating, I think what I want is something along the lines of a Dataset to List type of process... that would allow me to convert each record to a custom object and then create a list of those objects... that list of objects could then be stored in memory and the next set of data 3 seconds later could be used to compare to the original list to see if anything changed...  The windows service will not necessarily call a SQL Server sproc so this code needs to be made to work with other database servers...  It should be noted that the number of records being returned in each dataset will probably only be 1015 at the most... were not talking about thousands of records...p

Negative 27 pI have an application that after a hotkey combo it in effect sends a CtrlC to the foreground window, to send the selected text to the clipboard.

Negative 27 pFor my assignment I have to create a structure that allows the user to enter student info ID, DOB, amp Phone number. I have no problem doing this that is quite simple.

Negative 27 pI realize the title is crazy, but it really is the best I could think of. If anyone has better suggestions please leave them in the comments and Ill edit.p  pThis question is a followup to the question asked here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20132074droolsconstraintobjectotherthanpisfoundincollection20140828noredirect120140828Drools Constraint object other than P is found in collectionap  pFor those who dont want to click, that post describes the solution to the situation in which you want to know if there is a fact of CustomType which has a member field containing a value other than P. emThe Solutionem to this problem ended up being the followingp  precodec CustomType exists Objectthis  objectP from c.collection codepre  pThe above code works great. My problem is that I want to know when there does not exist an object of type CustomType with this property. Now, since line 2 relies on a bound variable given in line 1, we cannot simply negate line 1 with a not operator. Doing so would throw a runtime exception. The following is how I intuitively want to write the code, but keep in mind it doesnt workp  precodenot c CustomType exists Objectthis  objectP from c.collection codepre  pI cannot simply negate line 2, because then the rule would require the existence of at least one object of CustomType. I want to know when the first code example is not the case.p  pMy inner drooler tells me the original emSolutionem might be flawed. Ideally we would want to express line 2 within the parentheses of the CustomType. This would be expressing something more along the lines of there is a CustomType with the property rather than There is a CustomType, and there is an Object with the property. The former we could negate with a not operator, but Im not sure what to do with the latter.p

It is about making a kind of nd numpy array with meaningful dimensions right now called dimarray, particularly useful for geophysical data handling.p  pFor now say we havep  precodeimport numpy as np from dimarray import Dimarray    the handy class I am programming  def makedatanlat, nlon      generate some example data          values  np.random.randnnlat, nlon     lon  np.linspace180,180,nlon     lat  np.linspace90,90,nlat     return lon, lat, values codepre  pWhat worksp  precodegtgtgt lon, lat, values  makedata180,360 gtgtgt a  Dimarrayvalues, latlat, lonlon gtgtgt print a.lon[0], a.lat[0] 180.0 90.0 codepre  pWhat does notp  precodegtgtgt lon, lat, data  makedata180,180  square, no shape checking possible  gtgtgt a  Dimarrayvalues, latlat, lonlon gtgtgt print a.lon[0], a.lat[0]  is random  90.0, 180.0   could be actually I raise an error in such ambiguous cases codepre  pThe reason is that Dimarrays codeinitcode methods signature is codevalues, kwargscode and since codekwargscode is an unordered dictionary dict the best it can do is check against the shape of codevaluescode. p  pOf course, I want it to work for any kind of dimensionsp  precodea  Dimarrayvalues, x1.., x2...,x3... codepre  pso it has to be hard coded with codekwargscode The chances of ambiguous cases occurring increases with the number of dimensions. There are ways around that, for instance with a signature codevalues, axes, names, kwargscode it is possible to dop  precodea  Dimarrayvalues, [lat, lon], [lat,lon]  codepre  pbut this syntax is cumbersome for eminteractiveem use ipython, since I would like this package to really be a part of my and others  daily use of python, as an actual replacement of numpy arrays in geophysics.p  pI would be VERY interested in a way around that. The best I can think of right now is to use inspect modules stack method to parse the callers statement p  precodeimport inspect def fkwargs     print inspect.stack[1][4]     return tuple[kwargs[k] for k in kwargs]  gtgtgt print flon360, lat180 [uprint flon360, lat180n] 180, 360  gtgtgt print flat180, lon360 [uprint flat180, lon360n] 180, 360 codepre  pOne could work something out from that, but there are unsolvable issues since stack  catches everything on the linep  precodegtgtgt print flon360, lat180, flat180, lon360 [uprint flon360, lat180, flat180, lon360n] [uprint flon360, lat180, flat180, lon360n] 180, 360, 180, 360 codepre  pIs there any other inspect trick I am not aware of, which could solve this problem  I am not familiar with this module I would imagine getting the piece of code which is right between the brackets codelon360, lat180code should be something feasible, no p  pSo I have the feeling for the first time in python to hit a hard wall in term of doing something which is theoretically feasible based on all available information the ordering provided by the user IS valuable information . p  pI read interesting suggestions by Nick there a hrefhttpsmail.python.orgpipermailpythonideas2011January009054.html relnofollowhttpsmail.python.orgpipermailpythonideas2011January009054.htmla and was wondering whether this idea has moved forward somehowp  pI see why it is not desirable to have an ordered kwargs in general, but a patch for these rare cases would be neat. Anyone aware of a reliable hackp  pNOTE this is not about pandas, I am actually trying to develop a lightweight alternative for it, whose usage remains very close to numpy. Will soon post the gitHub link.p  pEDIT Note I this is relevant for stronginteractivestrong use of dimarray. The dual syntax is needed anyway. p  pEDIT2 I also see counter arguments that knowing the data is strongnotstrong ordered could also be seen as valuable information, since it leaves Dimarray the freedom to check codevaluescode shape and adjust the order automatically. It could even be that not remembering the dimension of the data occurs more often than having the same size for two dimensions. So right now, I guess it is fine to raise an error for ambiguous cases, asking the user to provide the codenamescode argument. Nevertheless, it would be neat to have the freedom to make that kind of choices how Dimarray class should behave, instead of being constrained by a missing feature of python.p  pstrongEDIT 3strong, SOLUTIONS after the suggestion of kazagistarp  pI did not mention that there are other optional attribute parameters such as codenamecode and codeunitscode, and a couple of other parameters related to slicing, so the codeargscode construct would need to come with keyword name testing on codekwargscode. p  pIn summary, there are many possibilitiesp  pChoice a keep current syntaxp  precodea  Dimarrayvalues, lonmylon, latmylat, namemyarray a  Dimarrayvalues, [mylat, mylon], [lat, lon], namemyarray codepre  pChoice b kazagistars 2nd suggestion, dropping axis definition via codekwargscodep  precodea  Dimarrayvalues, lat, mylat, lon,mylon, namemyarray codepre  pChoice c kazagistars 2nd suggestion, with optional axis definition via codekwargscode  note this involves codenamescode to be extracted from codekwargscode, see background belowp  precodea  Dimarrayvalues, lonmylon, latmylat, namemyarray a  Dimarrayvalues, lat, mylat, lon,mylon, namemyarray codepre  pChoice d kazagistars 3nd suggestion, with optional axis definition via codekwargscodep  precodea  Dimarrayvalues, lonmylon, latmylat, namemyarray a  Dimarrayvalues, [lat, mylat, lon,mylon], namemyarray codepre  pHmm, it comes down to aesthetics, and to some design questions Is lazy ordering an important feature in interactive mode. I am hesitating between b and c. I am not sure the kwargs really brings something.

Negative 27 pOn a project I was working on a couple of years back, I was building a set of data about movies from Freebase. A simple shell script downloaded the film.tsv file from a hrefhttpdownload.freebase.comdatadumpslatestbrowsefilmfilm.tsv relnofollowhttpdownload.freebase.comdatadumpslatestbrowsefilmfilm.tsva. I then used the id field in that file to build the necessary MQL requests for each of the films retrieving the other properties I was interested in e.g. actors, genres.p  pAfter looking at the developers guide today I realise that Freebase has moved on a fair bit and significantly I see that the dump file I used before is no longer available. I also see that the dump file format is now RDF and from what I can tell the dump files are now only available as a single 22GB archive.p  pIf at all possible I would like to avoid downloading a 22G file each time I want to rebuild my data set so is it possible to retrieve individual dump files anymore e.g. like the film.tsv filep  pIf not is there an alternative way to obtain a full list of movie idsp

Negative 27 pIm wondering on a question about IO that as I can see its handled everywhere but I fail to see how its done.p  pLets say we have a file with text, and were making a text editor program or something similar the program should be able to open that file and treat it as a string of characters.

Negative 27 pGuys, I know there are some new features in JDBC4.0 and one of them is that you dont need to load database drivers explicitly as the JDBC API will automatically load the driver when you call getConnection.

I checked System.getProperties but there is no property named jdbc.driver. Even if I added it and set the value to oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver. It still doesnt work.

Negative 27 pSo I am making all my models is Blender and then exporting it to .fbx format using the File Export and then checking off XNA Strict Options.

No matter how much I scale it in Blender, it is always the same size in game. Any ideas Also, Im not sure if this is related, but if I have a model with multiple parts, it will only show one part of it. Any help is appreciatedp

Negative 27 pQ Is it possible to run xunit tests sidebyside with MSTest in VS 2013 If so, what am I doing wrongp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve migrated a .NET Solution from VS 2012 format to VS 2013.p  pI was unable to get the xUnit tests to work. After much troubleshooting experimenting with project types, MS Tools versions, creating new projects with just xUnit, and experimenting with xUnit versions and dependencies, I was able to narrow the problem down to having MSTests in the same project as xUnit tests. This worked before in VS 2012.p  pAs soon as I include just one test method marked with the code[TestMethod]code attribute, none of the xUnit tests will be run. They may appear in either the VS Test Explorer, or the ReSharper Unit Test Sessions panels, but they appear with either a [] under Not Run Tests for Test Explorer or [] for Unit Test Sessions. Having a class with the code[TestClass]code attribute, but emnotem a method marked with code[TestMethod]code still allows xUnit tests to run.p  pIt may turn out that this is a bug in an xUnit component, but Id like to see whether anyone else has had any experience to the contrary.p  pNote nearly all unit tests are based on xUnit, the MSTest is just there as a proofofconcept to ensure that its supported in case MSTests are to be used later.p  pCode Excerptsp  pemMSTestemp  precodeusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting  namespace YYY.XXX.Test.Unit      [TestClass]     public class MSTests              [TestMethod]         public void TestBlah                      Assert.AreEqual2, 2                codepre  pemxUnitemp  precodeusing Xunit  namespace YYY.XXX.Test.Unit      public class FactTests              [Fact]         public void TestBlah                      Assert.Equal2, 2                codepre  pstrongSW Versionsstrongp  ul liMS Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 12.0.210051 RELli liJetBrains ReSharper 8.1li lixUnit.net runner for Visual Studion 2012 and 2013  v0.99.2li liReSharper extension ul lixUnit.net Test Support v1.3.0li ulli lixUnit Project packages ul lixunit.1.9.2li lixunit.extensions.1.9.2li ulli ul

Negative 27 pI have a question about running an AB test against different pages on a website and if I should worry about them interfering with either tests results. Not that it matters, but Im using Visual Website Optimizer to do the testing.p  pFor example, if I have two AB tests running on different pages in the order placement flow, should I worry about the tests having an effect on one anothers goal conversion rate for the same conversion goal For example, I have two tests running on a website, one against the product detail page and another running on the shopping cart. Ultimately I want to know if a variation of either page affects the order placement conversion rate. Im not sure if I should be concerned with the different tests results interfering with one another if they are run at the same time.p  pMy gut is telling me we dont have to worry about it, as the visitors on each page will be distributed across each variation of the other page. So the product detail page version A visitors will be distributed across the A and B variations of the cart, therefore the influence of the product detail pages variation A on order conversion will still be measured correctly even though the visitor sees different versions of the cart from the other test. Of course, I may be completely wrong, and hopefully someone with a statistics background can answer this question more precisely.p  pThe only issue I can think of, is a combination between one pages variation and another pages variation worked together better than other combinations. But this seems unlikely.p  pIm not sure if Im explaining the issue clearly enough, so please let me know if my question makes sense. I searched the web and Stackoverflow for an answer, but Im not having any luck finding anything.p

Negative 27 pOk, let see how traditional nonAjax page work. Suppose you have a page like the below linkp  precodeabc.comsearchitemcar codepre  pIn the traditional nonAjax website, when first time you call codeabc.comsearchitemcarcode, it will go to server and get data. After that you go to other page like codeabc.comcustomernametomcode and then you hit back button it will go back to codeabc.comsearchitemcarcode. However, this time it wont call to the server again cos it remembered it did before.p  pNow Here is the GWTP problem. Suppose the above codeabc.comcode was built in GWTP technology.p  pAt the first time wen user enters the codeabc.comsearchitemcarcode, the GWTP app will initialize the page search via codeonBindcode, then the codeprepareFromRequestcode will be called amp it will go to server to get data.p  pThat is Good, no problem. However, if we open a new page like customer page by using coderevealPlacecode, then we hit the back button it will go back to search page amp it will call codeprepareFromRequestcode again. The codeprepareFromRequestcode will then make the exactly same call to server again. That is not good cos it wastes resource.p  pSo I want the prepareFromRequest to be called ONLY at the time we initialise the page run after onBind amp block the prepareFromRequest in all other page request ex like user press the back button.p  pIt mean prepareFromRequest should work just like traditional nonAjax page mentioned above.p  pCan we do that orp  pDo you have a better solutionp

Negative 27 pI have an existing angular  phonegap app that Im trying to port to a windows metro app for win8.  Ive replaced my jQuery with a metro specific version and Ive wrapped each angular module in the MSAp.execUnsafeLocalFunction method and Im getting the application to sort of compile.  p  pWhat is happening is that the page is built using a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuiuirouter relnofollowangular ui routera, so Im able to see the dynamically created page, with angular ui router combining the 3 or 4 partials based on the route.  However, when Angular starts to go through ngbind, ngrepeat, etc... Im getting the following error, JavaScript runtime error Unable to add dynamic content.

Negative 27 pI have an Android library project I am trying to add to my build path that contains source not a compiled jar.p  pI figured out how to go to Build Path  Configure Build Path   Link Source, and then choose my library folder.p  pThis correctly adds the folder to my Android project.  However, the linked library has a package line at the top of each source file, and Eclipse does NOT like this, saying The declared package does not match the expected package.  The suggested fixes all involve modifying to have the expected package declaration or moving to the declared package location the library source files, which I do not think I want to do.p  pI have ZERO experience with packages OR Android libraries.  Is there something obvious Im missing  If at all possible I want to use the libraries as is, without modifying the source. Moving them doesnt seem all that useful, either since then git might try to commit them, although I suppose I could put the whole directory in .gitignore.p  pWhat is the CORRECT way to fix this problemp

Negative 27 pI have noted that when using polymorphism in PHP, things like this show upp  precodeclassName  someVariable  i.e. specific product name myClass  new className  class ProductA extends Product class ProductB extends Product ... codepre  pNamely, the class instantiation uses a variable for the class, and not a hardcoded string.  In my IDE I can click on a class name, in the code where that class name is being called, and have it resolve to class declaration.  When a variable name is used for a class name, no such autoresolution by the IDE is possible.  Human is needed to readunderstand the code and find the relevant classes.p  pOne way to resolve this of course is do something likep  precodeswitchproductName      case productA  myClass  new ProductAbreak     case productB  myClass  new ProductBbreak     etc.  codepre  pbut then thats not taking advantage of polymorphism and leaving around code duplication.p  pIs there a way to keep polymorphism while keeping resolvable classesp

Negative 27 pMy map loads icons from the API while scrolling around.  The delay makes the markers pop into existence, which I dont like visually.  Preferably, they would grow from a pixel to their normal size or fade in.  I figured fade in wouldnt be too hard to do with css3 transitions.  Markers have the method codesetOpacityncode so I tried initializing the marker likep  precodemarker  L.marker     coordinates,     opacity .1 .onadd, gt     setOpacity1  codepre  pbecause I realized adding a marker was async so if I set the opacity too early, the transition wouldnt apply because the marker element wasnt in the DOM and the marker would render at full opacity.  This is why I tried listening to the codeaddcode event.  But that doesnt work.  apparently the event fires too early.  If i put setOpacity in a timeout, it works fine.  But I do not think that is a good way to write this, especially because it introduces even more delay on top of the API. p  pHow can I fade in my icons  I think a lot of people want this feature, so maybe it would be a good leaflet plugin.p

In the watch I have a codeWearableListenerServicecode which correctly receives the messages and I use the Vibrator system service to vibrate a custom pattern right in the codeonMessageReceivedcode method, something a hrefhttpsgithub.comFutureHaxHourlyChimeblobmasterwearsrcmainjavacomt3hh4xx0rhourlychimeDataLayerListenerService.java relnofollowlikes thisa.p  pProblem is that when another vibration is going to start e.g. another message from my app, phone notification, etc. the current ongoing vibration is canceled and only the new vibration pattern is played.p  pI could not find any information about what happens when I call codevibrate...code while there is a vibration in progress. And it is really annoying that the current active vibration is canceled when a new vibration wants to start. Especially when an SMSemail arrives and with its very short vibration cancels my long vibration pattern.p  pIs there any way to not to cancel the current active vibration and just vibrate the new pattern in parallel I does not matter to me that it could be just one long buzz instead of a distinct pattern. Or is there a way to play the new vibration after the current ones end As far as I know, there is no API to check if there is an ongoing vibration.p  pOr is there a way to somehow prioritize vibrations I tried using the new Lollipop codevibrate...code methods, with codeAudioAttributescode but no change. It is even undocumented what is the true effect of suing the codeAudioAttributescode. Thank you.p

Negative 27 pThis is my first time dealing with IIS and DCOM so I apologize if I am butchering terminologyp  pI am trying to develop an Intranet web site and I am having fits with what I think is a permissions issue. There is a function called from a DLL referenced in the web application that reads data from several DCOM applications on the web server. p  pWhen I run the web application in the Visual Studio debugger on another computer on the network, it reads successfully. If I put the same DLL and function calls in an EXE and run it on any machine on the network, it reads successfully. I thought everything was good to go.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, when I deploy the web site in IIS, it throws an exception when reading from only one of the DCOM applications. The other ones read successfully. p  pThe run identity for the nonworking application is shown as The launching user in DCOM config, while the working ones are tied to domain accounts. These are legacy applications and I cannot easily modify run identities or access permissions.p  pIm guessing it has to do with the user name the IIS process is running under  I know the Visual Studio debugger and the test EXE all run under my Windows AD credentials which have fairly extensive privileges when I call them, but I dont know what credentials IIS is working with.p  pDoes anyone have suggestions on what the problem is and how best to address it I want to make sure Im heading in the right direction before I start asking for permission to modify DCOM configurations or IIS settings, neither of which I know anything about.p

The same goes for removing an entry. This freeze however does not occur in the method addEntriesToSelection but rather afterwards, when the backing bean fields are already updated.

Since we run hundreds thousands of test cases daily, we have to resort creating testng XMLs that execute entire packages, otherwise wed have to manually create an xml for each test, and thats not practical. p  pOne problem with executing such large tests containing hundreds of classes is that if theres one major issue such as webdriver stalling or hanging, the entire test will not run. Also, we have a listener that uploads to a server at the end of the test, so we have to wait hours for all results to be uploaded at once something more in real time would be better. Another problem is if the VMs reboot for whatever reason, all progress is lost and wed have to run the tests from the beginning.p  pIve seen Ant builds mentioned around the testng website, but Im not sure what the advantages of ant would be over just using the bat files to execute the XMLs. Can anyone shed light on this Or offer any solutions for executing a large number of tests with something more elegant than bat filesp  pThanksp
Negative 27 pI am using Dan Grossmans daterangepicker to display a range of datetime for users selection. Unfortunately the datetime that is selected and passed to the backend is in UTC and as such is being saved to database.

Negative 27 pIm trying to make a contacts list manageable by user input.

Negative 27 pIm now working on a web frontend application. Its using RESTful API to talk to the server, doing a lot of GETPUTPOSTDELETE requests. To speed up my development. I save some of the JSON response into a .JSON file on my dummy server. So when I run a request in development mode, the frontend will fetch those .JSON files instead of doing a real request to the server. This can speed up my development and reduce the overload of our server. However, it works only for GET requests. If I do the PUTPOSTDELETE requests, it always return 405 Method not allowed status code. How can I config my Apache to allow PUTPOSTDELETE request to those .JSON filesp

Negative 27 pIm working with a dataset in Gephi that is derived from a friends table from a Buddypress site. Ive done a number of things to the graph which are useful using the built in functionality, but would be interested in a better clustering algorithm than whats included Im using Force Atlas 2 to arrange the nodes. For instance, Id like to use my modularity property to group nodes into clusters. I tried downloading two plugins Girvan Newman and a Markov clustering algorithm, but cant figure out how to apply them to my graph. They show up in the clustering window on the workflow, but when I select them the Run button is grayed out. They also dont show up in the plugin drop down on the main UI. Any ideasp
Negative 27 pI am new to Akka and I am bulding a cluster system with many remote nodes. The remote nodes are called workers. Workers create chain of remote routers. p  pThe parentWorker which creates routers will have a stats watcher who will get message from all routees of routers. p  pThe qn is  Is is good practise to pass statswatcher actorRef while creating routers as constructor argument of the router or just pass actor path of statswatcher as constructor argument and user actor selection in router to tell message.p  p UPDATE  p  pAs per reply from akka mailing group replies passing actor ref as constructor argument is not a bad practice. Actor selection is useful for remote actor lookup.p

Negative 27 pWe are getting started using Angular in our existing Django app, and I have seen mention of the Django Rest Framework as well as DjangoAngular library.

Similarly, I can invoke codeBCryptDecryptcode sequentially on multiple buffers while deferring the actual authentication check until the end. I can not get that to work though, it looks like the value for codedwFlagscode is ignored.

Negative 27 pI was very successful in creating android apps with FlashDevelop 4.7. However, apple makes me troubles, as expected. I have created everything on apple developer site, mobileprovision file for app, .p12 file etc. IPA file has been compiled successfully. App has been installed successfully. But just wont run. After clicking icon, default.png displays for maybe second, maybe less, and just disappears. In app I have used nothing, just simple text displaying on the stage...p  pI dont know is the problem phone model 3GS 32 gb, or iOS 4.3.3 or cause OS is jailbreaked... It is just driving me nuts...

Negative 27 pIm working on a C project assignment for school.  One of the demands is that in case of codemalloccode failure, the program must codefreecode all allocated memory and codeexitcode.p  pConsider a case where function codeAcode constructs a linkedlist and in each iteration it calls to another function, codeBcode. Now, if a malloc failure occured at codeBcode, it must codefreecode the memory it allocated but function codeAcode should do that as well. p  pThings are getting quite complicated when you have a tree of function calls larger than two.p  pIn my previous project I used a flag to notify a malloc failure  if a function uses another function which may use codemalloccode, it has to check the flag right after.  It worked, but code got kinda messy.p  pIs there a neat solution for this problembr Of course, with real applications all memory is deallocated by the OS, but I guess this demand is pedagogical..p

At the same time, the video starts playing back from the beginning. br You can see the grey line on the player showing buffered video grow until at some point in time where it stops growing and the video stops playing when getting to this position. br However, the full video has been appended to the mediasource element, regarding to the output messages, and which can also be tested by manually jumping to another position in future or past. It looks like there is always just a fraction of the content loaded.p  pSince Im testing it on localhost the throughput is very high so I tried lowering this to more common values still good over video bitrate to see if Im overloading the client but this did not change anything.p  pAlso tried different segment sizes, with exact same results, except for that the time in point where it stops is a different one.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXImJl.png altVideo player stopping p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVujzg.png altConsole output at that momentp  pAny idea on where this limitation can be or what may be happeningp

Negative 27 pSo this is the progress of the simulation that I am making. This simulation has a list of players and each players has their assigned points or score. I have a patch called games. There are thirty games. Once the player hit the game or if they will meet on the simulation then there will be a label showing, hit which is already done. Each of the thirty games also has their own points. The points is generated randomly.p  pSo my question is that how will I be able to show on assign the players if they have won or not won the game My condition is that if the player has a point greater than or equal to the points of the game then it should show You won the game else You lose this happens when the player and game meets.p  pI will place another variable on my playersown that would indicate if it won or lose. But my problem is, I kept on trying to code the ifelseif on the move procedure for the condition that I want but Im having a hard time. I need help or some clue on how to do this.

Negative 27 pSo Im working on a new app using a Parse backend. The activity I am working on uses a recyclerview and cards to display a list of data. Ive built the adapter, viewholder, etc and have tested that it works when I manually supply data. However, when I try and retrieve the data from parse, it never makes it into the view. For example, in the code below everything inside the done method is working correctly, but as soon as Im outside of it bars is empty. The final Log.d line should be printing out the name of the first object in the ArrayList, but it never does. The toast makes the app crash on an invalid index because it says bars is still 0... aka the data is never added to it.

Negative 27 pIve been really enjoying Istanbul and experimenting with other Node.js coverage libraries as well, but I have an issue.

Testing the endpoint makes much more sense to me, as it not only tests codeupdateCustomercode, but also the routes, controllers, and everything else involved.p  pThis works fine, but the problem is that I cant seem to see a way for any code coverage tool to recognize these tests. Is there any way for Istanbul or anything else to recognize these Mocha tests If not, what is the convention How do you test endpoints and still use code coverage toolsp

But I want to read the incoming data all day , all year. whats happening is after it reads for sometime and there is a communication error or modbus rtu error such as value error r IO error. the code doesnt further execute and hence stops reading the data. what are the bugs that can be involved in such cases what are all the coding errors that may occur which is not letting me read data for 24 hours please helpp

Negative 27 pI recently had a very, very intense debate about the runtime complexity of a super simple algorithm with a colleague of mine.  In the end we both agreed to disagree but as Ive been thinking about this, its challenged my basic understanding of computer science fundamentals and so I therefore must get additional insight on the matter.p  pGiven the following python, what is the BigO runtime complexityp  precodefor c in How are you today     print c codepre  pNow, I immediately called out that this is simply on the order of On aka linear.  Meaning its dependent on the length of the string so therefore this loop will grow linearly as the length of the string grows.p  pMy colleague then said, No, its constant because we know that for the set of all strings we are dealing with in our case, the max string is always 255 characters long in our case, therefore it must be constant.  He followed on by saying because we have a max upperbound on character length of the string this results in O255 which reduces to O1.p  pAnyways, we went back and fourth and after 45 minutes of both of us drawing sketches we both deadlocked on the issue.p  pMy question is in what world or what math system is the loop above a constant time loop  If we knew our upperbound was say 1,000,000 characters and the set of all strings could be anywhere from 0 to 1,000,000 this loop will obviously exhibit linear running times depending on the size of the string.p  pI additionally asked him if he also thinks the following code is O1 if the upperbound size of n is known.  Meaning we are certain this code will only ever operate on a max upperbound of say 255 charactersp  precodes  How are you today for c in s     for d in s         print cd codepre  pHe said this is also constant time....even after I explained this is an On2 algorithm and demonstrated that the following code would produce a quadratic curve.p  pSo, am I missing some theoretical concept where any of the above is true depending on how the theory goes  strongJust to be clear his understanding is that I am correct if n is not known.  If the upperbound of n is always known he is asserting that the two algorithms on this post are both of constant runtime complexity.strongp  pJust looking to maintain my sanity, but perhaps if Im wrong theres certainly some additional learning I can benefit from.  My good, good colleague was very convincing. Also, if anybody has additional links or material on the subject specific to this question please add to the comments.p

Negative 27 pSo, I recently got into programming in python and decided to make a simple code which ran some simple maths e.g calculating the missing angle in a triangle and other simple things like that. After I made the program and a few others, I thought that maybe other people I know could use this so I decided to try and make this as simple as possible. The code can be found belowp  precodea  intinputWhats one of the angles b  intinputWhats the other angle in the triangle c  a  b d  180 f  int180  c printf codepre  pThe code itself does work but, the only problem is that if you have more than 1 question, it becomes tedious and a rather cumbersome task to constantly load up Python and hit F5 so, my idea was to have it loop an infinite number of times until you decided to close down the program. Every time I tried searching for a way to do this, all of the while True statements were for bigger and more complicated pieces of code and with this being maybe my fifth or tenth piece of code, I couldnt understand a few of the coding for it.p  pId appreciate any help or advice for this subject as itd make my day if anyones willing to help.p
