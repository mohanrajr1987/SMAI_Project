Positive 28655 pI am using sqlite3 and I am trying to retrieve all rows ordered by some col1 with null values coming last. As of now I am using this kind o queryp  precodeselect  from table order by row1 is null, row1 asc codepre  pAs there are many rows in my table, the query worked quite slowly, so I decided to create an index on tablerow1. p  pAfter creating the index it extremely improved the speed of queries likep  precodeselect  from table order by row1 asc codepre  pHowever sqlite doesnt seem to use that index with order by col1 is null type of queries. p  pWhy sqlite, based on that index, cant just move rows with null values to the end Is there any way I can make null values come last without the need to evaluate every row every time again p

Positive 28655 pI am trying to streamLine queries to SQLITE3. I use it for financial price modelling and so am reusing the same basic query alot, but have to keep changing the hard coding to get out different column queries each time. So I want a generic query where I just write in what I want once, then it spits out the columns as lists. This is a basic version of what I want but basically still hard coded so you can see what I am trying to create.p  precodedbName  NASDAQEquities ticker  AAPL  def pullDataTestdbPathName, ticker, args    datep  []    openp  []    highp  []     db  sqlite3.connectdbPathName  .mydb, detecttypessqlite3.PARSEDECLTYPES  sqlite3.PARSECOLNAMES, timeout3 cursor  db.cursor     cursor.executeSELECT     strargs    FROM   ticker    for row in cursor        datep.appendrow[0]        openp.appendrow[1]        highp.appendrow[2]    pullDatadbName, ticker, datep, openp, highp codepre  pAt the moment I am lost on how to enter an args into the select statement as it rejects it because of the  brackets. Also what will be an issue is creating empty lists and appending to those lists from from an args. Would it be better to create a order dict to append to, then brake that into lists at the end somehow On returning values for use later down the track I was thinking of making them globals Any suggestions Thanksp

Positive 28655 pI have some piece of software which generates a textonly SQLite3 DB, another one which performs some operations on said DB and in the end there is a PHP interface I use for a demo and so it will be removed as soon as the demo ends which performs some codeSELECTcodes and shows part of the data. p  pEverything is ok and working until the PHP connects to the DB I doublechecked at every step, at which point the charset encoding is messed up in the DB, not only in the visualization. Both PHP and the DB use utf8 as the charset and Ive tried to connect to the DB using the codeSQLITE3OPENREADONLYcode flag but nevertheless when I open the DB I find the charset messed up. Am I missing some parameter in PHP Please note that the PHP code is only part of a demo and will not be released with the software, so I can change anything in the PHP but nothing in the previous steps.p

Positive 28655 pSo Im in the process of creating some IOSApp using SQLite and FMDB and everything is running smoothly, except for some kindof strange behaviour of the engine regarding NULLValuesp  pPicture this SQLp  precode    select someattribute1, someattribute2,   minsomeattribute3 as minday, dhamstart, dhamend, dhpmstart, dhpmend  from doctorhours join doctors dr on dr.dockey  doctorhours.dhfkdoc where dhamstart is not null and dhamend is not null or dhpmstart is not null and dhpmend is not null and dr.docfachrichtung  1 group by dhfkdoc order by minday, case when DHamstart is null then 1 else 0 end, DHamstart, dhpmstart] codepre  pSo whats happening there, I am selecting some data from a schedule of opening hours of medical doctors. If his office is not open in the morning, values for DHAMstart end DHAMend are NULL, then I fetch hours from DHPMstart and DHPMend, those are columns of type VARCHAR. p  pThis rather elaborate SQLstatement should return the next available medical doctor... it works perfectly in the SQLShell I use RazorSQL. But when executed within FMDB framework there i create a string containing the SQLstatement, send it via [db executeQuerysqlstring] to the database and get a FMResultSet containing the results.p  pThe resultset contains 000000 for the columns containing NULL, thus the sort gives some incorrect results. p  pI do have a workaround by filtering the 000000 values and doing a sort of the resulting array. But the question remains p  pWhat is happening with my NULLValue  Why is the resultset sorted differently in the SQLShell and within FMDB p
Positive 28655 pBefore I begin I have looked through similar errors and cant seem to find the issue.  p  pBackground I am creating a registration form using model.py in Django. I have the form running in my dev environment.  Once I input data into the form, it should save it in the sqlite3 db.  However at the moment, when I have completed filling in the form I see two issues. These are as followsp  pIssues 1 Despite having an email address in the email field, it comes up with this field cannot be null.  So I then add nulltrue in my models.py file for email.  Once I have completed this and try again I get 2 another error saying this field cannot be blank.  I then in my models.py file add blanktrue for email. This results in enabling me to complete the form and register the data.  However now, I am faced with issue no.3 3 When I go into the db, and click to see whose registered, it says none where the email should be.  When I click on none I see the following error my code is belowp  precodeTypeError at ............. coercing to Unicode need string or buffer, NoneType found Request Method GET Request URL    ......

Positive 28655 pI found this problem in my application using Python3 with a SQLAlchemy connected sqlitedatabase. I designed the data structure from the view of an objectorientated developer.

In my data structure this make sense. But maybe it break a SQLRDBMSrulep  pWhen I do this in Python3 with the object it causes an error because SQLAlchemy try to execute an DELETE statement for that.p  precodea.bbb.clear codepre  pThe errorp  precodeDELETE FROM abrelation WHERE abrelation.aoid   AND abrelation.boid   1, 1 ROLLBACK sqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError DELETE statement on table abrelation expected to delete 1 rows Only 2 were matched. codepre  pThe error make sense for me in that case. But I dont know how I could handle that.p  pFrom my view it looks like a bug in SQLAlchemy because the constructed DELETE statement doesnt take care of my use case.

It is about making usage statistic for a gym. p  pYou walk to a machine and lift some kilograms a couple of times  that is called codeTrainingUnitcode what is equivalent to codeAcode in the example. For warming up you make 12 repetitions and lift up 35 kg in each of them  that is called a codeSetSetcode equivalent to codeBcode in the example keep in mind that codeSetcode is a reserved SQLkeyword. Then you make a oneminutebreak and do 12 repetitions with 40 kg  the second set. And you do a third again with 12 repetitions and 40 kg again. So the codeTrainingUnitcode instancerow need three relations to instancesrows of codeSetSetcode. Because the second and third set have the same valuessettings I would use the same instancerow of codeSetSetcode here.p  pMost of the time the sportsman does TrainingUnits each day in the same configuration  which means each day the sets have the same values. That is why I want to reuse that instancesrows of codeSetSetcode. And the number of sets per TrainingUnit are not fixed  it depends on the sportsman how many sets heshe will make.p

Negative 28655 pWe have to validate large amounts of resource files for naming conventions and format integrity, etc.p  pIs there a frameworktool available to make this easier  Build tools like AntPhing spring to mind but I wonder if theres something more focused to this kind of testing.p  pIdeally it would cache results based on modificationtime and generate a report of nonconforming files.  It should be flexible enough to quickly and easily add arbitrary tests to files that fit a certain regex.  Like test all .psd that lie 3 directories deep and ensure their colorspace is CMYK.  It should be easy to add depdendencies too so that if one of those PSDs fails, the parent directory .. say 2 levels up, would be flagged invalid too.  Ideally it would be pluggable so we can just write a shell script or something to perform new tests like the CMYK test that returns truefalse.p  pOf course we can roll our own... but rather not reinvent the wheel.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 28655 pIm setting up a large database that will generate statistical reports from incoming data.br  The system will for the most part operate as follows  p  ol liApproximately 400k500k rows  about 30 columns, mostly varchar530 and datetime  will be uploaded each morning.  Its approximately 60MB while in flat file form, but grows steeply in the DB with the addition of suitable indexes.li liVarious statistics will be generated from the current days data.    li liReports from these statistics will be generated and stored.li liCurrent data set will get copied into a partitioned history table.li liThroughout the day, the current data set which was copied, not moved can be queried by end users for information that is not likely to include constants, but relationships between fields.li liUsers may request specialized searches from the history table, but the queries will be crafted by a DBA.li liBefore the next days upload, the current data table is truncated.li ol  pThis will essentially be version 2 of our existing system.  p  pRight now, were using MySQL 5.0 MyISAM tables Innodb was killing on space usage alone and suffering greatly on 6 and 4.  4 is currently not a partitioned tabled as 5.0 doesnt support it.  In order to get around the tremendous amount of time hours and hours its taking to insert records into history, were writing each day to an unindexed historyqueue table, and then on the weekends during our slowest time, writing the queue to the history table.  The problem is that any historical queries generated in the week are possibly several days behind then.  We cant reduce the indexes on the historical table or its queries become unusable.p  pWere definitely moving to at least MySQL 5.1 if we stay with MySQL for the next release but strongly considering PostgreSQL.  I know that debate has been done to death, but I was wondering if anybody had any advice relevant to this situation.  Most of the research is revolving around web site usage.  Indexing is really our main beef with MySQL and it seems like PostgreSQL may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on functions.  p  pIve read dozens of articles about the differences between the two, but most are old.  PostgreSQL has long been labeled more advanced, but slower  is that still generally the case comparing MySQL 5.1 to PostgreSQL 8.3 or is it more balanced now  p  pCommercial databases Oracle and MS SQL are simply not an option  although I wish Oracle was.p  pNOTE on MyISAM vs Innodb for us We were running Innodb and for us, we found it MUCH slower, like 34 times slower.  BUT, we were also much newer to MySQL and frankly Im not sure we had db tuned appropriately for Innodb.  p  pWere running in an environment with a very high degree of uptime  battery backup, failover network connections, backup generators, fully redundant systems, etc.  So the integrity concerns with MyISAM were weighed and deemed acceptable.p  pIn regards to 5.1 Ive heard the stability issues concern with 5.1.  Generally I assume that any recently within last 12 months piece of software is not rocksolid stable.  The updated feature set in 5.1 is just too much to pass up given the chance to reengineer the project.p  pIn regards to PostgreSQL gotchas COUNT without any where clause is a pretty rare case for us.  I dont anticipate this being an issue. COPY FROM isnt nearly as flexible as LOAD DATA INFILE but an intermediate loading table will fix that. My biggest concern is the lack of INSERT IGNORE.  Weve often used it when building some processing table so that we could avoid putting multiple records in twice and then having to do a giant GROUP BY at the end just to remove some dups.  I think its used just infrequently enough for the lack of it to be tolerable. p

I want to validate strongonlystrong the visible elements on the form. p  pIm having a hard time getting this to function correctly. I want to disable validators for nonvisible elements and I cant seem to figure out the best way to do this. Any insight to what may be wrong with my code, or my approach would be appreciated.p  pWhen visibility is toggled, Ive tried a few thingsp  ul liCalling codeform.rulesremovecode to clear all existing validation rules. This throws an undefined JavaScript exception.li liCalling codeform.validation...options...code for the visible elements, hoping this would overwrite the rules. This only allows the first group that is validated to work. The second panel can not be validated.li liUnbinding the submit handler before calling the new codevalidationcode method. This didnt do what I would have thought. It removes all validation seemingly permanently and the form submits without validation.li liClearing out the validation object with code.removeDataform, validatorcode before trying to call the validator again.

Negative 28655 pWeve had quite a bit of discussion among our development group concerning whether the composition of entities should drive the database design, or should the database design drive the composition of the entities.p  pFor those who have dealt with this, what has been your philosophy Of course, not every entity maps 11 to a database table. But, for those that do, how have you handled this IOW, which comes first, the database table and then a corresponding entity or an entity and then a database table to persist itp  pThanks.p

Negative 28655 phello dr.Nick  So I posted a question yesterday about a content loader plugin for jQuery I thought Id use, but didnt get it to work. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2469291jquerycouldusealittlehelpwithacontentloaderhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2469291jquerycouldusealittlehelpwithacontentloaderap  pAlthough it works now, I see some disadvantages to it. It requires heaploads of files where the content is in. Since the code essentially picks up the url in the href link and searches that file for a div called codecontentcode brbr What I would really like to do is to collect all of these files into a single file and give each divcontainer its unique ID and just pick up the content from those. So i wont need so many separate files laying around. p  pNick Craver thought I should use code.getcodeinstead since its got a descent callback. But Im not that strong in js at all.. And I dont even know what this means. Im basically used to Visual Basic and passing of arguments, storing in txt files etc. Which is really not suitable for this purpose.p  pSo whats the normal way of doing things like this Im pretty sure Im not the only one whos thought of this right I basically want to get content from a single php file that contains alot of divs with unique IDs. And without much hassle, fade out the existing content in my main page, pick up the contents from the other file and fade it into my main page. p
Negative 28655 pI just bought a new MacBook Pro which comes with Snow Leopard 10.6.2 Mac OS X 10.6.2. I am used to using XAMPP as my local development server on XP. Since Mac OS X is based on Unix, I was thinking on activatinginstalling all the necessary stuff as I would normally do on Linux. However, I am not quite ready to be playing around with the system at this point so having an external package would be a nice temporary solution I think.p  pThe question is whether I should go with MAMP or XAMPP. Does anybody have any suggestions The Pro and Cons I suppose. As far as I know, Mac OS X comes with Apache2 and PHP5. Would MAMP or XAMPP modify the existing Apache and PHP installation Any comments on how I should proceedp  pPS Eventually I would use the default installation of Apache and PHP, and install a binary package of MySQL but time for development is an essence and I dont have time to familiarize myself with Mac OS X.p

Negative 28655 pOk, so hopefully I can explain this in enough detail for somebody to be able to help me.. I am writing a program in C that is supposed to take a text file and replace specific text, which happen to be names of files, and print a new text file for every single combination of the given filenames. The specific places to change the text of filenames have their own set of possible filenames, listed as an array described below. The program should run regardless of how many filenames are available for each location as well as how many total locations for the filenames. If you really wanted to make it awesome, it can be slightly optimized knowing that no filenames should be duplicated throughout any single text file.p  pcodetextcode is an array of lines that make up the base of the total file.p  pcodelineNumcode holds an array of the line locations of the filename entries.p  pcodepreviousFilescode is an array of previously used filenames, starting with what is already in the file.p  pcodefilescode is a jagged 2dimensional array of possible filenames where codefiles[1]code would be an array of all the possible filenames for the 2nd locationp  pHere is an example of how it would work with 3 separate filename locations, the first one given 3 possible filenames, the second given 8 possible filenames, and the third given 3 possible filenames.p  pOh and assume buildNewFile works.p  precode        int iterator  0         for int a  0 a lt 3 a                      for int b  0 b lt 8 b                              for int c  0 c lt 3 c                                      iterator                     text[lineNums[0]]  text[lineNums[0]].ReplacepreviousFiles[0], files[0][a]                     text[lineNums[1]]  text[lineNums[1]].ReplacepreviousFiles[0], files[0][a]                     text[lineNums[2]]  text[lineNums[2]].ReplacepreviousFiles[1], files[1][b]                     text[lineNums[3]]  text[lineNums[3]].ReplacepreviousFiles[1], files[1][b]                     text[lineNums[4]]  text[lineNums[4]].ReplacepreviousFiles[2], files[2][c]                     text[lineNums[5]]  text[lineNums[5]].ReplacepreviousFiles[2], files[2][c]                     previousFiles  new string[]  files[0][a], files[1][b], files[2][c]                      buildNewFiletext, Info.baseFolder  networks  Info.dsnFilename  iterator  .dsn                                        codepre  pIf you guys can help me, thank you so much, I just cant figure out how to do it recursively or anything.

Negative 28655 pI have found what I think to be a big security flaw with Safaris Top Sites image cache.

Negative 28655 pIm trying to figure out something having to do with the behavior descibed by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1370021this old question from last yeara. Ive got a form with a single input text field, and a single submit button. Unlike the person who asked that question, I emwantem the form to submit when the user hits enter. Indeed, thats working for me whats not working however is the quirk that causes a submit input in the form to be virtually clicked Firefox and Chrome include the submit inputs name in the parameters posted, while IE does not. In other words, I want this quirky submit behavior to post the text input field, and the submit input too.p  pThe funny thing is that my form was doing just that up until some mystery change I introduced recently. Firefox and Chrome do still work, but IE once worked and now doesnt.

Negative 28655 precently I came to study clustering in datamining and Ive studied sequential clustering and hierarchical clustering and kmeans.p  pI also read about a statement that distinguishes kmeans from the other two clustering technique,saying kmeans is not very good at dealing with nominal attributes,but the text didnt explain this point.So far,the only difference that I can see is that for Kmeans,we will know in advance we will need exactly K clusters while we dont know how many clusters we need for other two clustering methods.p  pSo could anybody give me some idea here on why such statement exists,i.e.,kmeans has this problem when dealing with examples of nominal attributes and is there a way to overcome thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 28655 pI stay away from Application.DoEvents, since there is the issue of reentrancy and there is always another way to avoid holding up the UI.

Each tidbit would be processed quickly enough that it should not hold up the message queue or UI significantly.p  pSo, is there any harm or drawback to this approach Namely, is it safe to call DoEvents in the Idle event I do know that a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20101028asynchronyinc5partone.aspx relnofollowC 5 will have a feature to address this sort of situationa, but for those of us who arent using C 5 which is most of us at the moment, and out of general curiosity, is this a good plan Or is there a simpler alternative to process messages during a longrunning operation without resorting to multithreadingp  pPlease dont think that I imagine this to be a magic bullet. I know that it comes with emthe same pitfalls as any asynchronous approachem. I am aware that one must still be able to keep his application in a consistent state. And I emamem aware that there are multithreaded solutions. I am avoiding those. Why Because multithreading is more complicated. I dont think that thats impractical.p
Negative 28655 pAs part of an iPhone game, Ive got buttons that grow a little when you press them, and shrink back when you release as a way of responding to user input.

Also, I need to be able to sort each item by one of its subitems i.e. lets say subitem4. If subitem4 is equal to some string then it would display that item into the UITableView however if subitem4 isnt equal to that string I compare it to then that item wouldnt get displayed in the UITableView. As of right now I really dont have any working code because Im not sure how to go about making this work. I dont know how I would do this because I have 1 array right now with all of the subitems together and Im just separating each subitem and putting them into separate arrays so I can distinguish between each item row, Im do it with the following codep  precodeint totalNames  [Names count] id name  [Names objectAtIndex1] [listOfItems addObjectname] codepre  pIm pretty sure Im going about this the wrong way. There must be a better way to do this logically. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Im mentally exhausted with this. Thanks.p

Negative 28655 pIm developing a steganography app for a class project which allows a user to encode a secret message image with in another image. I use codeBitmap.getPixelx,ycode to retrieve pixel information after modifying the pixel integer value to contain the message value. I then used codeBitmap.setPixelx,ycode to place the modified pixel in the bitmap. After decoding the image and retrieving the hidden message Ive noticed some pixels were discolored. Ive found that certain pixels do not contain the correct value after being modified. if I usep  precodeint before  encodedvalue bitmap.setPixelx,y, before int after  bitamp.getPixelx,y codepre  pfor most of the pixels beforeafter however on some beforeafter. If I continuously modify before by adding or subtracting one this only changes the color slightly in the message image  and then set the pixel again the values of before and after still differ. Having a few pixels off in the decoded image wouldnt be that big of a deal. However, when one of the problem pixels shows up where I encoded the message image information the images dimensions  the decoded dimensions will usually contain a non digit value such as 2q3x300. Which will through an exception when the application tries to turn this string into integer values. Ive also tried to get and set pixels using a integer buffer however the same pixels cause problem. Also through some debugging Ive found that certain pixels cause problems and certain values cause problems if I encode the image with with a doubled dimension string 213213x300300 the string is decoded from the image as 2q32q3x300300. Im not sure if this is a problem that start when decoding the bitmap from an image file or its a bug in the getPixel and setPixel methods. It seems that certain pixels cause a bit to be off. In the above example 1 which contains an ascii value of 49 or 00110001 is decoded as q which contains an ascii value of 113 or 01110001 only a single bit value differs from the set and get however it can cause bit problems. The Bitmap is in ARGB8888 and thus should be able to contain any value that can also be contained in an integer value. For the stereography to work Im modifying the least 2 bits of the alpha, red, green and blue values to store 1 byte. I reduce the message image to RGB332 so that It can be contained in the least bits. One more example is trying to set a pixel to 53029643.p  precodeI put           53029643  1111 1100 1101 0110 1101 0100 1111 0101 and get returns 53029387  1111 1100 1101 0110 1101 0101 1111 0101                 XOR                            0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0000 0000  256  codepre  pAlthough these two only differ in the least bit of the green value. The decoding of this integer value by taking the least 2 bits from each bit yields 00100101 instead of 00100001 the bytes are in the form RRRGGGBB thus green value is changing from 000 to 001 and the resulting bit map will contain a pixel with a green value of 001000 instead of 000000 since the decoded bit map is in RGB565 and thuse the decimal value from green is 8 instead of 0. Here the 3 png images the first is the carrier image the image that has the message image encoded into it the second is the message image the image that is encoded in the carrier image and the third is the message image after it has been decoded from the carrier image.p  pcarrier imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comndEC0.jpg altcarrier imagep  pmessage imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOGuvf.jpg altmessage imagep  pdecoded message image.

Negative 28655 pBeen using Pycharm to write a server.p  pI have some unittests using the unittest library from Python.p  pI was just running the tests and everything was fine, I could set breakpoints anywhere in the code. Yesterday I started running the server through the debugger.  I found that my breakpoints no longer worked.  Visually they are still there, they lookbehave in every way like a working break point, except they dont actually cause execution to break, they are just ignored as if they were disabled.p  pToday when I tried to run tests again, I am observing the same behavior in all files emexceptem those in my test library.p  pI tried an experiment, adding a new file to the server code with a simple function in it. Breakpoint in function, call function from test, run test through debugger, no break. Copied the file into my tests directory, reset the breakpoint in the function, changed import statement to point to new location of test file, ran tests.  Now it stops at the breakpoint in the file.p  pI have tried every basic sanity check I can think of quit PyCharm.  Reinstall PyCharm.  Delete PyCharm preferences.  Reboot.  I still get the exact same behavior.p  pFor what its worth, run to cursor exhibits the same problem in anything but test file, it just runs without stopping.p  pWhat is really crazymaking is this was all working fine yesterday.  At least breakpoints were working when I was running tests.p

Negative 28655 pI develop on my local machine with VS2010 and SQL Server.  Naturally, my web.config points to my local SQL Server and I can debugdevelopment and all is well.  Unfortunately, I am not entirely sure on how to go about deploying my code to a live server.  p  pCurrently, my live server consists of a virtual machine my site is accessible from the internet.  When Im ready to put my changes on the live server I publish my app right click on solution explorer  publish.  Then I go to the directory it publishes to and dump all the files into a network share that goes to my site on the live server.  On the initial copy over, I have to manually edit the web.config so that the connection string points to the SQL Server on the live server instead of my local machine.  So this is my first stumbling block.  How can I easily manage development settings and live settings in the web.configp  pNow, I also use version control Kiln.  Can I possibly tag a changeset and have it automatically deployed to my live server somehow  Lets say someone submits a bug and I fix it.  I push my changeset and now Kiln has the latest version of my code with the bug fix.  Whats the best way to get these changes on to a live serverp  pIm unable to find any documentation that covers the entire workflow but I feel like there has go to be a better way.  Surely, something like this can be accomplished without having to manually edit the web.config everytime I publish and pray to the computer Gods that I didnt miss something in the connection string.p  pIts just me so I have complete control over all of my environments, including the server and whats accessible via the internet, and anything is possible if only I knew what to do.p

Negative 28655 pI have a column on my mysql table that is currently VARCHAR, it is named logcount.p  pUpon user creation the logcount is set to nothing, and once the account is verified it sets itself to 0. If a user tries to login when it is empty it urges them to verify there account. Once verified it is set as 0, and everytime the user logs in it adds 1 to it.p  pThe reason it is set to VARCHAR is because if I set it to INT, mysql automatically sets it to 0 and will not let me have a blank value for it. Is there any setting that I can make this possible. And will having a column set to VARCHAR that will only ever contain an INT be a problemp

Restarting the application does not have any effect.p  pIf anyone has any suggestions Id appreciate it. Thanks.p

Also, each of the thumbnails are set to floatleft within the gallery div.p  pNow the question is, assuming 8 thumbnails get placed in each row, and assuming that 3 such rows got created by the query, can I give a borderbottom design to these rowsp  pBasically the question is, can i specify the border properties for the rows that are created by floating elements within a set width.p  pThanksp

Negative 28655 pI would like to do something with my C .NET applications that when they are started, they check with a .php site to determine if the IP address of the machine is in a MySQL database. This would be perfect for me as I have specific machines I want to allow my applications to run on, but I want to prevent the clients from just taking the executable and running it themselves.p  pWhat would I need to look into to set something like this up The part I really have no idea about is the authentication between a .php site and a C .NET application.p
Negative 28655 pI came across a question today of search efficiency for large sets today and Ive done by best to boil it down to the most basic case. I feel like this sort of thing probably relates to some classic problem or basic concept Im missing, so a pointer to that would be great.p  pSuppose I have a table definition likep  precodeCREATE TABLE foo     id int,     type bool,     reference int,     PRIMARY KEYid,     FOREIGN KEYreference REFERENCES fooid,     UNIQUE KEYreference  EngineInnoDB codepre  pPopulated with n rows where n2 are randomly assigned type1. Each row references another strongwith its same typestrong except for the first, which has referencenull.p  pNow we want to print all items with type 1. I assume that at some point, it will be faster to recursively call something likep  precodefunction printFoo1ref     ifrefnull         return     q  SELECT id, reference FROM foo WHERE id.ref     arr  mysqlfetcharray mysqlqueryq      echo arr[0]     printFoo1arr[1]  codepre  pAs opposed top  precodefunction printFoo2ref     q  SELECT id FROM foo WHERE type1     res  mysqlqueryq     while id  mysqlfetcharrayres          echo id[0]       codepre  pThe main point here being that function 1 searches for id, which is indexed, whereas function 2 has to make n2 comparisons that dont result in a hit, but that the overhead of multiple queries is going to be significantly greater than the single SELECT.p  pIs my assumption correct If so, how large of a data set would we need before function 1 outperforms function 2p

Negative 28655 pAll layout files Ive seen contain some outer bounding element such as LinearLayout. I would like to create a layout file that does not contain any bounding elements. For example, all I want is to have a TextView and nothing else. I then load this in code and insert it into an existing View. Without an outer bounding element, the app will not compile. Is there some kind of outer bound element I can use that acts as a plain vanilla container with no properties If you use LinearLayout, it will end up generating unnecessary code that my View does not require.p

Negative 28655 pThis isnt clever nor fun but Im stuck. A client of mine requires the need for a download of a presentation web site where videos can be embedded. Since OGG is a pretty obscure format for clients I ask them to upload MPEG4 encoded videos as either .mov, .mp4 or .m4v. These can be played using the HTML codeltvideogtcode or for browsers that dont support MPEG4 I use a Flash player since that can play them.p  pThis is fine for online and it works well.p  pWhen we go to download the presentation, the codeltvideogtcode element works fine in browsers that support MPEG4 video, even if theyre local. p  pSo we then come on to FireFox this doesnt support MPEG4. Nor can I get Flash to locally play a video because of security issues, unless we get them to go through the security settings but that isnt very nice.p  pSo we resorted to using the good ol codeltembedgtcode tag but this is very buggy with FireFox. It works fine on a server, it even allows me to have custom controls, but locally the videos dont play.p  pIve had some Googling around and it seems like a security issue but want to get a definite answer. Does anyone know why its not playing locally The URL is fine and the file exists. I notice that its common amongst version 4 so could it be a codec issue Is there another way I can get FireFox to play MPEG4s locallyp

Negative 28655 pPotentially silly question, but Im looking for the most sensible mechanism by which to maintain and resubmit POST variables.

Negative 28655 pI am trying to figure out how to create a textarea with 3 buttons bold, italic, underline. I cannot go with any WYSIWYG editor as I have tested most of them and no one fits my needs. e.g. most are configurable and could give me the option to have the 3 buttons but problems come when I paste formatted text in the field. Even if I set everything up, with tinymce for example, I get problems.p  pI really need a simple, basic, text editor with bold, italic, underline, and if I copy and paste formatted text in the textarea, I do not want it to act like a rich text editor, I want it to act like a real textarea, which will automatically remove ALL formatting. Peoples might say I could do it with properlyconfigured WYSIWYG editor but the answer is NO. I spent to many hours trying to configure the text editors to only accept bold, italic, underline and I got to many errorsbugs with all the well known WYSIWYG editors. I am not a programmer, I am a quality analyst so Im used to find bugs. p  pAre there any suggestions on how to create a textarea with bold, italic, underline capabilities and that will only accept those functions not a rich text editor. With Javascript, I would like to avoid JQuery if possible.p

Negative 28655 pI am creating an ethernet frame sniffingforwarding program on a Linux machine that I will use to sniff the frames being transmitted from a computer to ethernet and viceversa.p  pI am trying to activate pause frames so that I will not lose any packets, since having a twostep transmission to the router may cause some delay.p  pThe only way I have found to do this is by using ethtool to, for example, turn on pause frames from a receiving endp  precodeethtool A eth0 rx on codepre  pI have doubts about this which I hope an ethtool expert may put at ease, however.p  pAn option thats available using ethtool A is turning autonegotiation on or off.

For example, managing the pause time requested by the frame sender is not an option with ethtool.p  pSo, is ethtool really the best, or only way to configure pause frames Ideally, I would like to configure them through C code, but if ethtool is the only way to do so, Id simply like some confirmation that I am doing the correct thing by configuring pause frames with ethtool.p  pAnd if someone could point me in the right direction of a way to configure pause frames in C, I would be even more grateful.p  pThank you.p

So I have created the Student class table to break up the manymany relationship.

These are the stored proceduresp  pCreate A Studentp  precodeFirstName varchar20  ,  LastName varchar20  , PredictedGrade char1  , ActionPlan bit  0, StudentActive bit  1, StudentID int out  INSERT INTO Student FirstName, LastName, PredictedGrade, ActionPlan, StudentActive VALUES FirstName, LastName, PredictedGrade, ActionPlan, StudentActive SET StudentID  SCOPEIDENTITY codepre  pAdd Multiple Rows To StudentClass Tablep  precodeStudentClassCollection As InsertStudentClass READONLY  INSERT INTO StudentClassStudentID, ClassID SELECT StudentID, ClassID FROM StudentClassCollection codepre  pSo both of these work however I dont know how to make it so if one fails the other will not execute and changes will not be committed So effectively I need to perform both actions one after the other in the same stored procedure I think As I said I am new so if I have done anything wrong please let me know I will correct it p

Negative 28655 pI am curious to know if one could search the entire DOM with a regex that could then essentially identify the path used to get to the matching node. So in other words, I want to find all matches of a pattern, lets say the words hello and from that I want to identify its  branching within the DOM or the container parent at least. p  pApplying the regex match obviously finds the matches, but neglects to keep the context of where they were found within the DOM. Is there a way to override this matching to also print or associate the location of the match If not assuming a regex will not parse the DOM tree in the same fashion, are there any suggestion to achieve the desired resultsp

Negative 28655 pSuppose I have a sound file ding and a couple of other sound files s1, s2, s3, .... They are each to be played after the ding. That is, if Button 1 is pressed, Id like to hear a sequence of ding followed by s1.p  pIf Button 2 is pressed before [ding, s1] is done playing, I would like to stop the current playback and begin [ding, s2].p  pCurrently, Ive achieved this with jPlayers playlist addon. I simply set the playlist to [ding, s1] and it plays. Life is good. Well, almost.p  pProblem is that jPlayer doesnt even begin downloading s1 until ding is done playing, so the user hears a potentially long pause between ding and s1.p  pstrongAdditional infostrongp  ul lipThere are only 5 of these sound clips, all of which are very short few seconds of voice.pli lipFlash fallback is important.pli ul  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol lipWhat would be the best way to set this up to minimize the delay if any between ding and s1 Should I even use the playlist addon for thispli lipAm I in the best spot to have .mp3 and .ogg for each sound, or should I use a different mix of formats Goal is compatibility, but the size matters too.pli lipDo you recommend using HTML5 as a primary and Flash as a fallbackpli ol  pThanks p
Negative 28655 pFirst of all Im a bit confused as to what is really included with Pressflow. Is Pressflow just a collection of modules or are there some deeper core hacks that arent in D7 Would it be a reasonable solution to keep on going with our D7 install and adding the appropriate caching modulesp  pI understand that Drupal 7 works with Varnish out of the box, but then it also benefits from the Varnish module in some way. Im curious about whether theres a killercombo that people have generally converged on.p
Negative 28655 pIm trying to get the user to confirm if they want to delete a product using a MessageBox and catching its result. This is my codep  precode Confirm if the user really wants to delete the product DialogResult result  MessageBox.ShowDo you really want to delete the product   productName  , Confirm product deletion, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Warning if result  DialogResult.OK      MessageBox.Showdeleted  codepre  pWhen I run the code and try to delete a product, deleted never shows. On the MSDN page it says to use codeMessageBoxResultcode rather than codeDialogResultcode but Visual Studio doesnt recognise codeMessageBoxResultcode, and I use codeDialogResultcode elsewhere in my code for an open file dialog. Obviously, thats not the proper way to check it.p

Negative 28655 pIm not able to align more than 3 charting areas in MSChart vertically without calculating position manually. Seems like MSChart decided that if you add more areas it would start aligning them horizontally.p  pIve tried playing around with ChartArea Alignment properties like Orientation, Style and AlignWithChartArea, but it would overlap areas one on the other if you try changing these.p  pSo, has anyone tried working around this issue The last thing I can think of is to calculate positions and align areas manually.p  pThanks p

Negative 28655 pI encountered a very strange at least to me behaviour of a exception class I have thrown. What I do is that I allocate memory via codenewcode for a string in the constructor of the exception class and fill it with characters. So far everything is fine. When debugging the code I can see in Visual Studio that the pointer actually has the right content.p  pNow the weird thing happens. My next breakpoint is in the catch  block to which the exception is passed after being constructed and here I can see in the debugger that the content of the string contained in the exception object is severly corrupted. Even though the address didnt change at all So it seems like the content of the string gets destructed. p  pSo I put a breakpoint into the exceptions destructor and really, it is being called before the catch  block is entered. This confuses me a lot since I learned to pass exceptions by reference to the catch block. But what good is that if the destructor gets called before I can access the dynamically created data... p  pI constructed a minimal example that shows the situation I am inp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcstringgt  class testexception  public     testexception     testexception          delete[] msg            Getter Functions     char errorMessage const          return msg       private     char msg   testexceptiontestexception      msg  new char[22]     strcpymsg, This is a test string   int mainint argc, char argv[]      try          throw testexception      catch const testexceptionamp err          stdcout ltlt err.errorMessage ltlt stdendl           stdcin.get      return 0  codepre  pIt would be create if someone could tell me if it is weird MS behaviour or if I misunderstood how try  catch  blocks should be used.p

Negative 28655 blockquote   pNote When parsing XML resources, Android ignores XML attributes that   arent supported by the current device. So you can safely use XML   attributes that are only supported by newer versions without worrying   about older versions breaking when they encounter that code. For   example, if you set the targetSdkVersion11, your app includes the   ActionBar by default on Android 3.0 and higher. To then add menu items   to the action bar, you need to set androidshowAsActionifRoom in   your menu resource XML. Its safe to do this in a crossversion XML   file, because the older versions of Android simply ignore the   showAsAction attribute that is, you do not need a separate version in   resmenuv11.p blockquote  pSource a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicssupportingdevicesplatforms.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicssupportingdevicesplatforms.htmlap  p Despite this claim eclipse is refusing to compile an unaltered version of fragment basics from the same site a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfragmentsindex.html relnofollowherea.p  pThe error message given isp  blockquote   pString types not allowed at layoutwidth with value   matchparent.p blockquote  pIs there anyway I can suppress this error within XML, like some kind of silent tag that states they only apply to a specific API level Ideally I want the project to work in Eclipse and also maintain 1.6 backwards compatibility.p  pNOTE All other errors pertain to R not being generated making this the only first generation error.p  pThe manifest file does contain the linep  precodeltusessdk androidminSdkVersion4 androidtargetSdkVersion15 gt codepre

Negative 28655 pIm in need of some advice in proper codingp  pIm working on a program where multiple serial connections are used. Each communication line has a controller working as an abstraction layer. Between the controller and the serial port, a protocol is inserted to wrap the data in packages, ready for transfer. The protocol takes care of failed deliveries, resending etc. To ensure that the GUI wont hang, the each connection line protocol and serial port is created on a separate thread. The controller is handled by the main thread, since it has controls in the GUI.p  pCurrently, when I create the threads, I have chosen to create a message loop on them Application.Run, so instead polling buffers and yielding if no work, i simply invoke the thread BeginInvoke and uses the message loop as a buffer. This currently works nicely, and no serious problems so far.p  pMy question is now Is this good coding, or should i use a while loop on the tread and be polling buffers instead, or some third thingp  pI would like to show code, but so far it is several thousand lines of code, so please be specific if you need to see any part of the code. p  pThank you.p

Then you get your subviews in the codegetViewcode function by the codefindViewByIdcode. So i assume, that all the identical Views across your listitems have the same id.

Negative 28655 pThis came up in a code review and there was some disagreement on what to do. It involves a function that converts one type of array of objects to another.p  pThe complaint was that you are doubling the memory used for a short period of time because the function is called many times.  And at one point both the temp observablecollection and the observablecollection property that the temp observablecollection is assign to will be have data.  So right before the assignment is made the memory of the program would spike.  There were also concerns that garbage collection would not happen quick enough.p  pLots of solutions were proposed but they all involved breaking the encapsulation of the method and reducing the ease of maintainability.  Can anyone suggest an answer for thisp  pEdit I see a lot of people mentioning that this is a premature optimization.  This came up in the code review as well.  I think for this example we could assume the list is going to consume a huge amount of memory.  The review came down to memory savings vs code maintainability.

Negative 28655 pIm a first time poster long time listener and I would really be interested in reading about some of your localization architectures and, eventually, to get feedback on our approach as follows.p  pI would like some advice on an approach were thinking of using with resource files. We are using MVC 3.0 and have a website project and a resource project. In the resource project we have a structure which mimics the same structure as the website e.g. emcontroller  view  fileem.p  pWe reference the resx files in the views by importing the resource namespace on the top of the viewcontrol e.g. codelt Import NamespaceMyAppResources.Resources.Website.Home gtcode and then reference the resx value we need by using codelt Index.SomeText gtcode where index is the name of the resource file.p  pWhat we were thinking of doing and would love some advice is instead of using this approach is to divide the resource resx structure into website areas and use a helper e.g. codeLocalizationHelper.GetValueHome, SomeTextcode where Home is the name of the resource file and codeSomeTextcode is a value in that resx file. The reason we would do this is not to have to keep compiling the resource project for every small copy change we make as we may need a quick fix for our deployed environment and also it will probably  be the most commonly used helper in the website project so this would keep things short and consistent. The Localization helper would also store the values in a cached dictionary so if a value is used more than once it would retrieve it from the cache.p  pDoes anyone know of a better approach or improvements we have not thought ofp

Negative 28655 pOK, this one is rather complicated to explain, which explains the verbose title In my Objective C application I generate a JSON string to hold all of my properties for the objects I need to draw in the ARchitect browser of the wikitude SDK as far as I know the Wikitude SDK only handles JSON viap  precodeNSString javaScript  [self convertPoiModelToJsonself.poiData.pois] NSString javaScriptToCall  [NSString stringWithFormatnewData, javaScript] codepre  pOne particular object I am interested in is stored as a string in that JSON string, its the URL to an image. However, this image is behind a password protected area on our webserver and the app handles the authentication.p  pThe problems start when I am in the ARchitect Browser, which is basically a .html file with calls to specific wikitude javascript functions to build the augmented reality world and show it in a UIWebView in the app. I want to show that image when a POI in the augmented view is clicked in the footer popup which is a basic html div container. So now I have a URL to an image resource on the webserver, which I cannot directly access withp  precodedocument.getElementByIdthumb.src  jsonObject.thumbUrl codepre  pbecause of the authentication needed and the only way I was successful to load that image was via the codevar poiImage  new AR.ImageResourcejsonObject[i].iconURL, onError errorLoadingImagecode method but then I can only display it in the augmented view but not in the footer.p  pI tried it with providing a static string from some other image in the web or to local resources to the img element in the footer section in the view without problems like that codedocument.getElementByIdthumb.srcmarker.pngcode and it works fine, also the image is correctly loaded in the augmented view.p  pI have read about encoding the image which I can access and download in the objective c part of the app in base64 and storing that string in an additional JSON property to load it into the src property of the html img element with a codeltimg srcdataimagepngbase64,BASEampENCODEDDATAgtltimggtcode but this seems like a really dirty and overly impractical workaroundhack for what I try to accomplish. Also I dont know if its a better idea to start reading about how to implement the authentication to access that image in the protected area of the webserver or rather begin implementing the ugly base64 encoding or continue searching for alternatives.p  pIm not asking for a solution but rather for suggestions what possibilities I have left to access that image. Since I ran out of ideas, any help is appreciated.p  pThank youp  pShort summaryp  ul liimage accessible and downloaded in objective c partli liimage is accessible with the AR.ImageResource method of the wikitude SDK but not neededli liimage cannot be accessed directly via the url from javascript because authentication is neededli ul  pI hope my question is comprehensible, feel free to ask If something is unclear, especially since English is not my first language and it would be even complicated to explain that in German..p

Negative 28655 pIm building a web application and am looking into using Amazon S3 to store user uploads.p  pMy concern is, I dont want user A to see his download link for a document he uploaded is urltoMyS3doc1234.pdf and try urltoMyS3doc1235.pdf and get another users document. p  pThe only way I can think of to do this, is to only allow the web application to connect to S3, then check if the user has access to a file on the web application, have the web app download the file, and then serve it to the client. The problem with this method is the application would have to download the file first and would inevitably slow the download process down for the user.  p  pHow is user files typically handled with Amazon S3 Or is it simply not typically used in a scenario where the files should not be public Is there another service for something like thisp  pThanksp

Negative 28655 pSo, Im new to testing in js and Im trying to use mocha to test a node application.p  pIdeally Id like to have it so that the tests are in a separate file and are run on the node script itself perhaps by use of a require call at the top of the test script. At the moment Im doing something which I know cant be right which is to include the tests in a block at the bottom of the script file. The problem with this being test code included in production code and the fact that it comes back with describe is not defined when you try to start the node server.p  pIve read lots of tutorials on mocha, etc and it seems that you can export all of your methods individually by doing module.export., but that seems costly and is also obtrusive.p  pWhat am I missing here Surely you dont have to construct two scripts one with and one without the test code  that would end up with version issues.p  pHow is this best done links to articles also gratefully accepted. p  pThanksp  pJamesp

Negative 28655 pIm developing an iPhone application with Xcode 4.5.2, and when I run the app on a device or in the simulator, via Xcode, the logs are showing in the Xcode Console.p  pMy question is, when I build an Ad Hoc distribution build and install the app on a device and run it from the device, is there any way to watch the log output I need to tech support the app remotely and want the tester, who is elsewhere, to be able to see the logs.p  pQuestion two, can one build the project and and export the build, import it to Xcode on another machine and just execute it from Xcode without building This would solve the problem since the tester would be able to run the app from Xcode and thus see the logs.p  pThe problem is that Im using Sencha Touch, which isnt that easy for the tester to set up so that he can build the project locally.

Negative 28655 pI am looking for a C equivalent to Matlabs griddata function, or any 2D global interpolation method.p  pI have a C code that uses Eigen 3.  I will have an Eigen Vector that will contain x,y, and z values, and two Eigen matrices equivalent to those produced by Meshgrid in Matlab.  I would like to interpolate the z values from the Vectors onto the grid points defined by the Meshgrid equivalents which will extend past the outside of the original points a bit, so minor extrapolation is required.  p  pIm not too bothered by accuracyit doesnt need to be perfect.  However, I cannot accept NaN as a solutionthe interpolation must be computed everywhere on the mesh regardless of data gaps. In other words, staying inside the convex hull is not an option.p  pI would prefer not to write an interpolation from scratch, but if someone wants to point me to pretty good and explicit recipe Ill give it a shot.  Its not the most hateful thing to write at least in an algorithmic sense, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel.p  pEffectively what I have is scattered terrain locations, and I wish to define a rectilinear mesh that nominally follows some distance beneath the topography for use later.  Once I have the node points, I will be good.p  pMy research so farp  pThe question asked here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1329994matlabfunctionsincMATLAB functions in Ca produced a close answer, but unfortunately the suggestion was not free SciMath.p  pI have tried understanding the interpolation function used in Generic Mapping Tools, and was rewarded with a headache.p  pI briefly looked into the Grid Algorithms library GrAL.  If anyone has commentary I would appreciate it.p  pEigen has an unsupported interpolation package, but it seems to just be for curves not surfaces.p  pEdit VTK has a matplotlib functionality.

Negative 28655 pFor a given table in my system of record RDBMS, I need to implement a functionality to export the records incrementally. For example, if a user runs an export job which returns x number of records, I want to return a snapshot id back to the user. For the next export job, user will pass that snapshot id to me and using that I should be able to export only the records that have either been modified or added since. Ideally I would like my snapshot ids to be reusable. In other words, I do not want my snapshot ids to expire, but this is not a hard requirement.p  pGiven that I have LASTUPDATEDATE Timestamp column in all my tables, whats the best way to solve this problemp  pI am not looking for code, tools or commands.

Negative 28655 pI am currently implementing a small client server database in Java. p  pI model transactions using Java Objects. Each transaction contains a number of statements and some metadata. These  are passed from the client to the server and back using sockets and java serialization. They are then operated on in the database ex their metadata is updated, etc.p  pI have observed that native java serialization iscurrently the bottleneck, I therefore want to move away from it.  Having considered Kryo and manual benchmarking, I think that Protobufs are a good way to replace serialization. p  pThe system now takes Transactions and statements defined as protobuffers. p  pMy question is  is it more efficient to, upon receipt of a protobuffer on the server side, to create a regular Transaction Object, modify and operate on that, and then populate a new protobuf to send back to the client, or is it preferable to operate directly on the protobuf the operations I do on the transaction in the server involves updating lists, etc.p  pAlternatively, would it be preferable to use Kryo for such a use case p

Negative 28655 pSo I just ran into the nice edge case where doing a codereplaceAllcode on a String will choke if the replacement String has a  or  in it. p  pWhy is the replacement String not just a drop in replace for matches with the regular expression I dictate What am I not understanding about regular expressions herep  pQuote from a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangString.htmlreplaceAll28java.lang.String,20java.lang.String29 relnofollowOracle Java 7 Documentationap  blockquote   ppublic String replaceAllString replacementp      pReplaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the   pattern with the given replacement string.p      pThis method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input   sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not   part of any match are appended directly to the result string each   match is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The   replacement string may contain references to captured subsequences as   in the appendReplacement method.p      pNote that backslashes  and dollar signs  in the replacement   string may cause the results to be different than if it were being   treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be treated   as references to captured subsequences as described above, and   backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement   string.p blockquote

Assume that weve got CRUD application.p  ol liServer is written as EJB and manages data create, read, update, delete. It uses JPA to connect with database.li liClient is written using JSF2 and its a simple gui which uses remote EJB to manage data.li liBoth client and server works on different servers.li liTo use EJB, client needs to have EJB interface and entities entities are needed to deserialize objects returned by EJB.li liServer side Entities have got JPA annotations.li liClient side Entities needs to be the same as server but dont need JPA annotations.li liBoth client and server entities should be in the same jar library because its easier to maintain.li ol  pThose are my suggestions to solve the problemp  ol liCreate library which contains only entity interfaces so client and server can implement it in the way that they need.li liCreate library which contains entity implementations without JPA annotations server will need to use xml instead of annotations.li ol  pWhat is the best solution Are my solutions correct I would be grateful for any suggestions.p

Negative 28655 pFor all the machinelearning folks.p  pWhat Im wondering is how to search high dimensional data with the help of input in the form of user preferenceclicks.p  pSuppose I have a program that generates images from feature vectors. The program takes a random sample of N vectors, generates their corresponding images, and displays the images in a grid on a computer screen. Next, a user clicks on the image he thinks is best out of the N images displaying, and according to some given criteria. The program now generates another sample of images, displays these to the user, and repeats the process.p  pGiven a system like this, what algorithms would you employ to find the best feature vector and corresponding image... In the case Im working on, the feature vectors are binary valued of length 512, and the grid is 3x3 9 vectors picked at each iteration. Also, the user preference, or best, is a very subjective measurement.p
Negative 28655 pAssuming you are using DB4O with the standard configuration and outofthebox  meaning, you are using DB4Os standard internal id scheme, as per below.p  pFirst, as an assumption, when updating or inserting an object into the database, the programmer only has one option, to call objectContainer.storeobject. p  pNow, how does DB4O know whether to update an existing object in the DB, or to insert an entirely new one My guess is that DB4O looks to see if the internal id of the object is not null.p  pHowever, I could also see the possibility that the burden is on the programmer to first pull the object from the DB, then update it. strongSo my question is, how can we reliably update an object in a DB4O database without first pulling it into Java memorystrongp  pThis DB4O article doesnt really answer my questionp  pa hrefhttpcommunity.versant.comDocumentationReferencedb4o8.1javareferenceContentbasicsupdateconcept.htm relnofollowhttpcommunity.versant.comDocumentationReferencedb4o8.1javareferenceContentbasicsupdateconcept.htmap  pThis is very informativep  pa hrefhttpcommunity.versant.comdocumentationReferencedb4o8.1javareferenceContentplatformspecificissuesdisconnectedobjectscomparisonofids.htm relnofollowhttpcommunity.versant.comdocumentationReferencedb4o8.1javareferenceContentplatformspecificissuesdisconnectedobjectscomparisonofids.htmap

Negative 28655 pIm trying to understand how and where to use data after a fetch using Backbone.js but Im a little confused.br  Ill explain the situation.br  I have an app that, on the startup, get some data from a server. Three different kind of data.br  Lets suppose Airplanes, Bikes, Cars.br  To do that, Ive inserted inside the three collections Airplanes, Cars, Bikes the url where to get these data.br  Ive overwrited the parse method, so I can modify the string that I get, order it, and put it in an object and inside localstorage. I need it to be persistent because I need to use those 3 data structure.br  So with a fetch i get all those data and put them inside localstorage. Is it correct doing it that waybrp  pNow i need to make other calls to the server, like get the nearest car.br In the view i need to see the color, name and model of the car, all that informations are inside the object Cars in localstorage.br  In my view showcars.view I just call a nonbackbone js, not a collection, model or view where i get all the informations i need. In this js i dop  precodevar carmodel  new Car car is the backbone model of the cars carmodel.url  getnearestcar that give id of the nearest car carmodel.fetch         success function   here i search the Cars object for a car with the same id  and get name, color, model and put them in sessionstorage  codepre  pSo after that call, in the view I can get the data I need from the sessionstorage.  Is that a bad way of doing things If so, how i should fetch and analyze those informations I should do all the calls and operations inside the modelsbr Thanksp
Negative 28655 pThe task is to find a sequence of digits, which can either be transposed by some number or inverted then transposed, nested inside another equal or larger set of digits.

If the number is found either as is or transposed, output the start index of where it was found else if it was inverted or inverted and transposed, output index followed by inverted.p  pExample  If the number to look for was 67654, it could be found as 45432 transposed down by 2 or 32345 inverted or 54567 inverted and transposed up by 2p  precodeInput     67654       14676545   43234545679     905         codepre  pFirst line is what to search for 67654 and the remaining lines are what to search through.p  precodeOutput     3     7     10 inverted     14 inverted   codepre  pMy idea was to build a list of numbers which is the differences between each digit if the number to look for and that number inverted. e.g 67654 would make a list [1, 1, 1, 1]. I would then loop through each digit of the string to search though using a sliding window to check if it appears.

Negative 28655 pI want to create a theme, using a default WordPress theme as the initial point. p  pAccording to WordPress Codex, the recommended way to do that is to create a child theme. p  pUnfortunately, that approach may noticeably affect the performance of a site, because both themes have to be called before the site is actually displayed. WordPress tends to be fairly slow on quite a number of popular hosts, so slowing it down even further is not something I would want to do. p  pAt the same time, coding a theme from scratch seems to be inefficient when an open source theme is close enough to the desired result to only require certain minor recoding. p  pstrongQuestionstrong if I rename the theme in the main CSS file, theres still a lot of function callbacks and variables addressing the name of the old theme for example, twentyeleven. There has to be some central location where these are called from. What things do I need to rename, in addition to the theme name at the top of CSS file, to fully rename the entire theme an prevent it from being updated, should the original theme be updated by WordPress development themep

Negative 28655 pIm setting up a P2 themed using Houston child theme Wordpress. I want to accomplish the following but after hours and hours of searching I cannot figure out how to do this even though it seems like something that would be common.p  pIdeally, I would like a tag list in the sidebar with checkboxes for each tag. Only posts that match checked tags are displayed and it updates with Ajax rather than a page reload. It saves what you have checked to the user profile page will require login.p  pI would settle for simply having a tag listcloud that would update with Ajax if I could also have links that would display multiple tags. Its no problem if I have to hard code these taggrouping links.p  pBasically I want users to control what posts they are interested in reading, the assumption is no one will be reading every post, just the tags that pertain to them.p

Negative 28655 pI currently have two view controllers, a codeCameraViewControllercode that uses the imagePicker to take photos, and a codePhotoInboxViewControllercode that shows all the photo messages a person has received. codePhotoInboxViewControllercode, as well as my root view controller, is a codeTab Bar Controllercode.  p  pWhen I present the imagePicker in codeCameraViewControllercode , as well as the image preview screen that follows it, I  disable the TabBar by setting codeself.tabBarController.tabBar.hidden  YEScode. My issue is, when codePhotoInboxViewControllercode is then shown again for example, if the user cancels taking a photo, I would want the Tab Bar to be strongshownstrong  again. In my codeviewWillAppearcode method in I have the followingp  precodeIn PhotoInboxViewController  voidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewWillAppearanimated]      if [[[self tabBarController] tabBar] isHidden]         self.tabBarController.tabBar.hidden  NO        codepre  pIn debugging, I see that the codeifcode statement is indeed evaluated as tabBar as codeisHiddencode, and therefore the next line is executed as well.  However, my Tab Bar remains hidden.p  pWhat am I doing incorrectly Your help is appreciated  thanksp

Negative 28655 pIm very new in using Neo4j and have a question regarding the computation of intersections of nodes.p  pLets suppose, I have the three properties A,B,C and I want to select only the nodes that have all three properties.p  pI created an index for the properties and thus, I can get all nodes having one of the properties. However, afterwards I have to merge the IndexHits. Is there a way to select directly all nodes having the three propertiesp  pMy second idea was to create a node for each property and connect other nodes by relationships. I can then iterate over all relationships and get for each property a list of nodes which are connected. But again, I have to compute the intersection afterwards.p  pIs there a function I miss here, since I suppose its a standard problem.p  pThanks a lot, Bennyp

Negative 28655 pI am currently to implement a small drag and drop ranking question with angular.

To recreate the problem drag all options into the drop area the grey bit and then switch the first with the second place.

It looks like it just isnt repainting for some reason.p  pI had a look in the model with Batarang and everything looks correct in there.

Negative 28655 pI am trying to create an animation using a sprite sheet and a for loop to manipulate the background position until it has reached the total number or rows in the sheet. Ideally a reset back to the initial position would be practical, but I cannot even get the animation itself to trigger... p  pWith the current function, no errors occur and the background position in my CSS does not change. I even recorded using Chrome DevTools Timeline and there was nothing either then everything related to my page loading. I have also tried using backgroundpositiony as well as a simpler value rather then the math I currently have in place.p  pThis is my function p  precodedocument.loadfunction      var height 324     var rows 34     forvar i0 iltrows i         setTimeoutfunction              selector.cssbackgroundposition, 0px , 0  heighti  px         , 10       codepre  pI hate to ask a question that is similar to previous issues, but I cannot seem to find another individual attempting sprite sheet animation with a for loop, so I suppose it is its own problem.p  pp.s. I didnt include a snippet of my HTML and CSS because it is pretty standard and I dont see how that could be the problem. That being said, I am all ears to any potential thoughtsp

Negative 28655 pI have an application that needs to be able to refresh the oauth2.0 access token every 59 days through a cron job. I dont want to have the user perform the authenticate again on the front end, I just want this to happen on the backend using a cron. Is this even possible The main problem with the cron is that to get another valid oauth2.0 access token there needs to be a redirect. Does this redirect send information back to the cron for executionp  pOverall, at a high level I only want the user to grant permissions once for my app to get a valid oauth2.0 access token. I will store this in my database and after 59 days and I will execute a cron job to retrieve another one without the user ever having to do anything. Therefore the app works seamlessly and the user will never have to be authenticated again.p  pThanks,p  pKylep

It turned out that on the Loaded event, the viewmodel would repopulate the ObservableCollection the listbox is bound to. After preventing that from happening, the animation would play.p  pWhat I dont get is that the problem persists even if you do nothing with the bound values or datacontext, and instead use Items.First. Even if the viewmodel changes, it ought to still have a First item and stepping through shows that it indeed does.p

Negative 28655 pSo I already looked around a lot for this but couldnt find a good answer. Im using Celery 3.1.7 and Django 1.5.1., without djangocelery package since newer versions of Celery dont require it anymore. I managed to set up tasks and execute them using RabbitMQ. Everything is working as it should there. However, I am integrating this in a existing, quite large, Django project. There we specified couple of Django settings files, not just one. We run different one depending on environment, for instance one for local machines and one for server. My problem is that I cant seem to be able to track down which settings file is active from the celery worker, which runs celery.py file in my project root as documentation specifies. There the documentation requires to specify Django settings file like thisp  precodeos.environ.setdefaultDJANGOSETTINGSMODULE, project.settings.server codepre  pNow this works, but if I move the stuff locally I need to change it to codesettings.localcode to make it work, and that every time. Reading settings object in runtime like I do in standard Django files didnt work since celery worker executes in a different process. So, using this situation, does anyone have any idea on how to dynamically fetch active Django settings file from celery worker Or perhaps pass it in as a variable when starting celery worker like for Django, etc settingsproject.settings.local Thanksp

Negative 28655 pI am trying to execute a bit of code that scans for a user input value. This action is contained in a custom method I wrote, named getTriangleDim the method reads in the users int value, makes sure it is within a certain range, and then returns the int value that was entered.

Negative 28655 pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, I boiled it down to the codeiterationVariablecode.

Negative 28655 pIt seems like there should be a way of specifying a Model annotation likep  precode[DisplayNameState] [MaxLength2] public string State  get set  codepre  pso that when it is used in an EditorFor or TextBoxFor, likep  precodeHtml.EditorFormodel gt model.State codepre  porp  precodeHtml.EditorFormodel gt model.State codepre  pthe generation of the html would set the input fields maxlength to 2.

Negative 28655 pI was looking into the old concept of writing reenterant code. They say, dont use global, static variables. Because, it is prone to nondeterministic behaviour. However, I am not sure about whether it is applicable where there is a single thread. I understand thread safe and reentrancy are two different concepts. While using C, we avoid using global and static variables. Even, we try to avoid singletons. But, the question is what will happen to his piece of code borrowed from the wiki, if it is running on a single thread. Is it prone to nondeterministic behaviour.p  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReentrancy28computing29 relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReentrancy28computing29a p  precodeint gvar  1  int f      gvar  gvar  2     return gvar   int g      return f  2   codepre  pAnother part is people say that reentrancy and thread safe are unrelated. However, in this example we can make the results predictable by putting a mutex in function g. So, when two threads execute this g concurrently the results are deterministic. So, we actually fixed the nonenterant code by putting a thread safe mechanism. Please clear my concepts here. Am I missing something or my understanding is not rightp
Negative 28655 pUsing Stripe for billing services and it works great.  However, testing is a bit of a pain.p  pIm using rspeccapybara and have some feature tests that visit a codesettingscode page where the user may update their email, password, and billing information via Stripe.  In development and production, I want to display a list of invoices from the Stripe API.  However, in test mode I dont want to display the invoices as its expensive and I dont have valid customer tokens to communicate with the Stripe API.p  pMy solution is something likesp  precode settings.html.erb view lt unless Rails.env.test gt   lt invoices.each do invoice gt      display info for the invoice...   lt end gt lt end gt codepre  pIt just seems wrong to me to do a conditional on the Rails environment that way.p  pThe issue is that if I execute the calls to Stripes API Id have to ensure I have valid customercard tokens that communicate with Stripe and thats expensive and depends on a 3rdparty for my tests.p  pMy approach at the moment is to assume that Stripe is testing their API effectively so I only really test the values I pass to Stripes API. And anytime I display data from Stripe I skip it in test mode.p  pAre there any cleaner solutions to this type of problem  It should be the same general concept with any 3rdpart API that may be used when you run tests.p  pUpdate 20140327 1220p  pAnother thing Im considering is actually taking the penalty of creating valid Stripe customercard tokens when I do some of my feature tests.  Im torn because I see the need for a stubbedout faster testing mechanism, yet if my tests arent actually doing the same code they would do in production, Im really missing out on the working code part.p  pI would probably tag my rspec tests that make Stripe API calls with a stripe tag and run those only when I needed to do a full check usually before a major commit or deployment.p  pI guess at some point if youre really going to test things then you have to take the penalty and use the APIs just like your users would.p  pI have looked at some stubbing gems that mimic Stripe locally, but now Im adding a 4thparty into the system.  Id prefer not to do that as it seems to defeat the purpose of testing.p

Negative 28655 pImage my server provides an email service that I am using memcache for. When a sender sends a new email to user X, the key for X is removed from the cache. When user X makes a call to codegetInboxcode the response is added to the cache under the key for X so that the same response is returned for subsequent calls to getInbox until a sender removes the key and the process continues. So a very simple design. But what happens when X is reading at the same time that some sender is sending X an email Per my understanding putIfUntouched and getIdentifiable do not help here. As they seem to only work if I am using in putIfUntouched the exact same instancevalue returned by getIdentifiable, which is not possible in my case since I am talking about two different service calls. So does anyone know how I might avoid race conditions in my simple modelp  pstrongupdatestrongp  pIn light of AndreiVolgins response, let me add details to what I perceive to be the race conditionp  pSenders job is to remove the key recipients job is to 1 read the value with codesyncCache.getkeycode, 2 if the value is null then set the key to a real value with codesyncCache.putkey, valuecode. The problem is in the case where send is trying to set the value to null while at the same time recipient is calling codesyncCache.putkey, valuecode. If recipient wins in setting to codevaluecode then recipient may never get to see the change made by sender.p

Negative 28655 pIf I have two classes D1 and D2 that both derive from class Base, and I want to construct a particular one based on say, a boolean variable, there are various well known techniques, eg use a factory, or use smart pointers. p  pFor example, p  precode    stduniqueptrltBasegt b     if flag                  b.resetnew D1          else                  b.resetnew D2      codepre  pBut this uses the heap for allocation, which is normally fine but I can think of times where it would be good to avoid the performance hit of a memory allocation. p  pI triedp  precodeBase b  flag  D1  D2       doesnt compile  Baseamp b  flag  D1  D2      doesnt compile  Baseampamp b  flag  D1  D2     doesnt compile  Baseampamp b  flag  stdmoveD1  stdmoveD2    doesnt compile codepre  pMy intention is that D1 or D2 whichever is chosen is constructed on the stack, and its lifetime ends when b goes out of scope.

Further, it would only be suitable for classes that are inexpensive to copy, because despite my explicit request to use move, it does I think still call a copy constructor.  But if I take away the stdmove, I get a warningp  pI feel this is closer to what i think should be possible but it still has some issuesp  ul lithe lambda syntax is not friendly to oldtimers who havent yet embraced the new features of the language  myself includedli lithe copy constructor call as mentionedli ul  pIs there a better way of doing thisp

Negative 28655 pfor my final project in BScEE im trying to create an adhoc network. Im working on Galaxy S2 devices and writing most of my code in C  JNI . Except for sending normal message, im also automatically sending broadcasts every 5 seconds. There is a thread which is listening and waiting to receive data. I keep crashing due to segmentation fault using ndkstack and addr2line it points me to recvfrom  codeint retval  recvfromsockfd, buf, BUFLEN, 0, struct sockaddrampcliaddr, ampslen code A thought im having is that because most of the time there is a thread running and waiting to receive , its a false alarm and the segmentation issue is somewhere else. p  pHow can I debug the cause for the segmentation fault, and if its actually caused by the recvfrom code.

Usingcodeprint i.model.datai.toStringcode prints the visual text of the ComboBox, rather than the id integer.  Although codeicode references the index location, I dont see why its returning the related SQL tables text content, rather than the id of the base table thats to be read fromwritten to.  Also tried changing to codeprint i.model.datai, Qt.EditRole.toStringcodep  pAny help would be much appreciated. p

Negative 28655 pNow im into my first question, after not finding an answer in the internet. Usually this should be a really easy thing, but it took me hours and hours so please excuse me if its a beginner question. Also i want to make sure im going the right way before spending more days just to see that in the end it just not works as i want, the way i implement it atm.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pMy App has 3 Tabs with 3 fragments as content, one for every tab. I use Tabs because all users i asked want Tabs and not a Navigation Drawer and i listen to users, not to google sorry. Also the 3 tabs have very different roles Language Guide, Currency convertor, and own Notebook for own phrases etc and it makes sense to split it this way imo. If someone has other ideas, go ahead, im open p  pThe tabnavigation works as intended so far. But now i want to build the further navigation for the single Tabs an im not sure anymore wich way to go... Theres just so many way for a simple thing like this...p  pThe first Tab has some imageButtons to further navigate into this section See Screenshot 1, to choose a category in the language section. Of course this means the tabs should be stay in place to be able to easy switch to the Converter i.E, just the fragment from tab 1 should get switched to the new fragment see Screenshot 2, and so on. The Buttons that you see in the below screenshot have clicklisteners that change current fragment to the new one like Dailyp  pFor this i open another fragment and add it to the backstack. Maybe you already can guess what happens now. If i press the backbutton, i come back to the first fragment of course. Problems start when i switch tabs when im inside a fragment opened on tab 1. The added fragment is still in backstack what means if i press back button on Tab 2 or 3, the displayed content gets mixes up somehow with the other fragment ones. See Screenshot 3p  pDo i make an error somehere or can i simply tell the backstack to reset when switching tabs so this problem doesnt occurp  pThank you for info and sorry for language and spelling errors, english isnt my main language.p  pTablistener Class to switch the tab fragmentsp  precodepublic  class MyTabListener implements ActionBar.TabListener  Fragment fragment  public MyTabListenerFragment fragment      this.fragment  fragment   public void onTabSelectedActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft      ft.replaceR.id.fragmentcontainer, fragment   public void onTabUnselectedActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft      ft.removefragment   public void onTabReselectedActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft       nothing done here  codepre  pp  pThe Fragments class from first fragment look like this not full codep  precodepublic static class FragmentTab1 extends Fragment      public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState         final View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.tab, container, false          ImageButton catBtnDaily  ImageButton view.findViewByIdR.id.catBtnDaily         ImageButton catBtnOnTheRoad  ImageButton view.findViewByIdR.id.catBtnOnTheRoad         ImageButton catBtnShopping  ImageButton view.findViewByIdR.id.catBtnShopping         ImageButton catBtnRestaurant  ImageButton view.findViewByIdR.id.catBtnRestaurant         ImageButton catBtnRomance  ImageButton view.findViewByIdR.id.catBtnRomance         ImageButton catBtnEmergency  ImageButton view.findViewByIdR.id.catBtnEmergency            attach an OnClickListener         catBtnDaily.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener               Override              public void onClickView v                     Create new fragment and transaction                  Fragment newFragment  new FragmentTab4                   FragmentTransaction transaction  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction                   transaction.replaceR.id.fragmentcontainer, newFragment                  transaction.addToBackStacknull                   transaction.setTransition4097                  transaction.commit                        codepre  pMainactivityp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity  ActionBar.Tab tab1, tab2, tab3 Fragment fragmentTab1  new FragmentTab1 Fragment fragmentTab2  new FragmentTab2 Fragment fragmentTab3  new FragmentTab3  protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitytabtest      ActionBar actionBar  getActionBar     actionBar.setNavigationModeActionBar.NAVIGATIONMODETABS      tab1  actionBar.newTab.setTextHome     tab2  actionBar.newTab.setTextCalculator     tab3  actionBar.newTab.setTextNotebook      tab1.setTabListenernew MyTabListenerfragmentTab1     tab2.setTabListenernew MyTabListenerfragmentTab2     tab3.setTabListenernew MyTabListenerfragmentTab3      actionBar.addTabtab1     actionBar.addTabtab2     actionBar.addTabtab3 codepre  pCannot post pics yet, rep too low....p  pPlease see here third pic is called Untitled3.pngp  pScreen 1 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms3av3pf6a17p2w42Untitled1.png relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms3av3pf6a17p2w42Untitled1.pngap  pScreen 2 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms3av3pf6a17p2w42Untitled2.png relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms3av3pf6a17p2w42Untitled2.pngap  pScreen 3 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms3av3pf6a17p2w42Untitled3.png relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms3av3pf6a17p2w42Untitled3.pngap

Negative 28655 pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI have a bunch of HTML with multiple tables, two of which are of interest posted above.  The first table describes a person, their address, phone number, and so on.  The second table describes information about their account.  Both tables have headers text in codelth3gtlth3gtcode tags through which they can be referenced. I am relatively new to manipulating HTML and so my first question is how someone goes about taking the first table and importing it into an Access database or into Excel so that if they had 50 of these documents the columns would be, in this example, Name, Address, Phone, Age, with each row being a different person.  p  pMy second question is slightly more complicated.  The second table has another table embedded in it.  Essentially this means that there are lots of smaller split up tables that need to be put into one complete table.  That is, I am hoping to find a way to treat it as an additional column in the main table the one actually given its own header housing this smaller table.  The idea would be to then manipulate this table in the same way as the first table.  The final problem is that these tables dont have a common field that I can use to relate them, so there would need to be a way to take a field from the first table and append it to the second table.  Considering this, I think the steps needed can be summarized as followsp  blockquote   ol   lipFor a single HTML document take the second table and perform the   actions necessary to append the smaller tables  tag and   the main tables  codeltth colspan7gtltthgtcode to the section formatted   aspli   ol blockquote  precodelttrgt lttd styletextalign centergt1lttdgt lttd styletextalign centergt102013lttdgt lttd styletextalign centergt12345678lttdgt lttd styletextalign rightgt0167lttdgt lttd     styletextalign centergt102014lttdgt lttd styletextalign rightgt0036lttdgt lttd styletextalign centergt1111lttdgt   lttrgt codepre  blockquote precodeso that all 9 pieces of data get their own column upon import.  2.

Please feel free to point me in the right direction, if I missed something.p  pIm very new to android programming, having mostly experience in C and C. p  pFor my first project I picked something small. I want to programm an app for my wife and me, which manages the contents of our freezers.  Its simple. You create a freezer, define a certain amount of compartments and then add content to those compartments, which contain certain attributes food type, amount, weight, expiration date etc.p  pNow, obviously this database will not contain a hell of a lot of info. Maybe 50 items tops So from what I gathered XML might be a good way to go.p  pHowever, this data will be modified quite often. Things will be added, removed, modified, moved from one compartment to another. Would sqlite be a better choice in that situationp  pI would greatly appreciate any advice you guys and girls might have. Again, small database, lots of modifications along the way ... XML or sqlitep  pThanks a lot in advance. p  pMichaelp

Dependent on the type of the item, I want to adjust after what time the next item shall be emitted slow down or speed up the interval.p  pThe following code, as proposed by a.bertucci here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26206805emitobjectsfordrawingintheuiinaregularintervalusingrxjavaonandroidEmit objects for drawing in the UI in a regular interval using RxJava on Androida demonstrates how to emit items in a regular interval.p  precodeprivate void drawPathfinal String chars      Observable.zip         Observable.createnew Observable.OnSubscribeltPathgt               all the drawing stuff here             ...         ,         Observable.timer0, 50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,         new Func2ltPath, Long, Pathgt              Override             public Path callPath path, Long aLong                  return path                                .subscribeOnSchedulers.newThread     .observeOnAndroidSchedulers.mainThread     ...  codepre  pMy question now is, if it is possible at all to modify the emission frequency while the observable is emitting, and whats the preferred implementation using RxJava.p

Negative 28655 pI am building a chrome extension that needs a backend to store user information. So far, we have been using Firebase, a realtime solution that we can access from the front end. Yet we will need to store approximately 200GB of data so Firebase seems less viable for a startup budget. p  pWe were looking into transitioning  to hosting a node.js app in the cloud and then communicating with a mongodb database. We were looking into Azure for this purpose. Yet it seems the only way to do this is getting MongoLab, which is still really expensive.

Negative 28655 pI recently had to reinstall Android Studio as a last ditch attempt to fix the javafind.exe not found bug. Unfortunately, this new build seems to have a radically different AVD interface that makes me unable to configure a lot of aspects of my virtual devices that I would have been able to with the original format and worse seems to only create emulated devices that never progress past the bootup screen. After an extensive amount of googleing I seem to be the only one on the planet who has this interface, so any explanation or advice would be massively appreciated.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com8eojEHH.png altimagep  pEDIT Heres an image of an emulated device I just made. For the API I have no other option other than different versions of 21. In this case I chose the first option.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comKckrLJj.png altimagep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comCKsiXrB.png altimagep  pHowever, the same problem still persists where the emulator never progresses past the android screen. Its been running for 10 minutes now when before my emulators would start in less than two.p  pIve also just noticed this error hidden way in the bottom left corner of android studio. p  pCould not find a matching system image for ABI x86, API 19null Could not find a matching system image for ABI x86, API 19nullp  pCould this be related at allp
Negative 28655 pLets say that I am designing a Hotel reservation application for a hotel chain.  With the following tables relationshipsp  ul licodeHotelcode HotelIdpk, Name, Address, City, State, Zipli licodeHotelRoomcode HotelRoomIdpk, HotelIdfk, RoomNumber, FloorNumberli licodeClientcode ClientIdpk, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, CardOnFileli licodeReservationcode ReservationIdpk, HotelRoomIdfk, ClientIdfk, ReservationDate, CheckInDate, CheckOutDateli ul  pWhen someone creates a new reservation the unit of work would involve creating a new client, provided this client does not exists which is the assumption I would like in this case, then creating the reservation for the new client.  This seems to pose a problem when using the unit of work, as the client pk needs to be created before the reservation can be added.  What is the suggested way to deal with this issue  I would rather use a unit of work over wrapping the code in a codeTransactionScopecode.  p

Negative 28655 pIve been working with certificates, symmetric and asymmetric keys, and things related to web application security. I am developing a web application in Tomcat 7, and I must perform a secure exchange of data between client and server using TLS. In my research, I found the a hrefhttpkeystoreexplorer.sourceforge.net relnofollowKeyStore Explorera V. 5.1.p  pI have some questions related to the use of this program. I know that here may not be the appropriate place to make these types of questions, because the site owner of KeyStore Explorer has a a hrefhttpsourceforge.netpkeystoreexplorerdiscussiongeneral relnofollowforuma. However, the forum does not allow me to create new topics.p  hr  pWhen we create a new key pair, we face a window which asks us to choose the algorithm used for the pair generation. After choosing, key generation is made, and then a new window is displayed to the user with the strange name Generate Key Pair Certificatep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8LIIY.jpg altenter image description herep  pIt is on this screen that comes some doubts. In this new screen, the program request the user to choose a signature algorithm, a validity period, and the name, where data from user entitys key pair must be filled.p  pWhat does it mean Am I creating a Digital Certificate signed by myself And if I am, is there a way to create only a key pair I was not supposed to create a pair, and from that create a CSR to send it to a Certificate Authority with CSR containing strongthenstrong the details of the entity requesting the digital certificate in case, mep  pWith the a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase6docstechnotestoolswindowskeytool.html relnofollowkeytoola, I believe we can create a key pair only. But the funny thing is that when we create a keystore with a key pair with the keytool, we open the generated file with the KeyStore Explorer and the pair seems to have been signed by the creator himself, as a digital certificate, for instancep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiJUUx.jpg altenter image description herep  pNote that we have two fields, subject and Issuer...p  pWhat I really want is to be able to create a key pair and from that pair generated I want to create a CSR. I know in the program itself comes with documentation. I researched and read the part named Key Pairs the Generate Key Pair topic and etc., but unfortunately I could not solve this confusion. Would someone please explain to me what am I doing wrong and what this all mean p  pAs always, I thank you all for your attention and time.p  pbibliographyp  pa hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase6docstechnotestoolswindowskeytool.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase6docstechnotestoolswindowskeytool.htmlap  pa hrefhttpswww.digitalocean.comcommunitytutorialsjavakeytoolessentialsworkingwithjavakeystores relnofollowhttpswww.digitalocean.comcommunitytutorialsjavakeytoolessentialsworkingwithjavakeystoresap  pa hrefhttpswww.sslshopper.comarticlemostcommonjavakeytoolkeystorecommands.html relnofollowhttpswww.sslshopper.comarticlemostcommonjavakeytoolkeystorecommands.htmlap  pa hrefhttpruchirawageesha.blogspot.com.br201007howtocreateclientserverkeystores.html relnofollowhttpruchirawageesha.blogspot.com.br201007howtocreateclientserverkeystores.htmlap  pa hrefhttpkeystoreexplorer.sourceforge.netreleases.php relnofollowhttpkeystoreexplorer.sourceforge.netreleases.phpap

Negative 28655 pWe are using CrossRider to develop an extension for Internet Explorer. I tested our extension in debug mode, I changed the base URL of the Local File Paths  but the files are not updated after saving the new base URL  I see alerts from the previous version and I already removed these alerts in the new version.

Negative 28655 pI have spent some time working with the AjaxFileUpload control and I am having a great deal of difficulty utilizing it. The issue I am having is that I have set the max number of files that can be selected for the upload Que. Once I click upload, the process works great and the files are stored. However, I can go back and upload additional files. This is an issue because I only want the user to be able to select up to 3 files for the upload Que and for the control to only upload 3 files. Is there a way that I can disable the Select and Upload button once the max number of files is reached If so, is there a way that I can clear the files uploaded from the control if the user wants reupload to the controlp  pI have found limited information on this topic on the web.

Negative 28655 pAt runtime.p  pPlease read before commenting, the problem is very subtle Its not as simple as using an assert typeid p  pI have made my own implementation of a scene graph and I have it so that you can attach children nodes to any other node in the graph as normal. What is special in my implementation is thisp  pyou can attach a child node to a parent node only if the childs type is derived from the parent or is the same as the parent.p  pIn order to understand why I have this restriction, consider what happens when a Node calls its update in a Scene Graph. It must call its own virtual updateThis and then walk through the graph and update each child, so each child must derive from type Node.p  pNow consider I want to create a brand new KIND of node called Renderable. Renderable has draw and virtual drawThis. Renderable is a type of Node, so it can call update and has virtual updateThis. The problem comes from void attachChild Node child . If I attach a simple Node it will compile but when I call draw on the highest node of type Renderable, and it tries to call draw on a child of type Node, it will obviously crash. I have to ensure that all its children are of type Renderable, rather than just type Node if I mandate that draw propagates to every child.p  pThat is the dillemma. I want draw to propagate to every child.p  pIm using this pattern heavily. I have an Audible class with a play and virtual playThis method which does what you expect.p  pAnd I have multiple virtual inheritance to create classes which define objects that can be updated, can be drawn, and can be heard. For example, a background can be drawn and updated, a vessel can be drawn and updated and heard, and a stage cannot be drawn or heard but it can be updated. In order to make the stage visible you add a background to it by attachChild Background , where Background is derived from Node  and happens to derive from Renderable as well .p  pThis scheme gives me a lot of flexibility but it is type unsafe. I have to excersise caution and due diligence to ensure that I do not try to staticcast a Node to an Audible for example. From a design  philosophical point of view I do this by mandating that every child of something that can be heard, must also be something that can be heard. Every child of something that can be seen must also be something that can be seen. Every child of something that can be updated must also be something that can be updated.p  pFirst let me say that IT WORKS if I am careful and I ensure that every child is derived enough. But the problem is how do I tell the compiler to warn me when it isnt And what about run time safety I want to compiler to tell me when I broke my own rules, so I need a way to tell the compiler what my rules are.p  pIts not as easy as it seems to solve the type safety problem. You would think that C gives you tools to check the type and make an error if the type isnt correct, but there are various barriers that prevent me from using the standard toolsp  pI cant use assert  typeid this   typeid argumentToAttachChild   because the most derived type is always used, and according to the documentation these expressions will not compare equal unless the types are exactly the same a derived type will not compare equal to a type it derives from. Assert also doesnt give me run time safety.p  pI cant simply override the attachChild Node  with attachChild Renderable  in the class definition for Renderable because it creates ambiguity since every Renderable is a Node and technically the signatures of these functions are different so its not really an override.p  pI cant use the curiously recurring template pattern because it is possible to attach a Renderable to a Node.p  pI cant figure out how to make this more safe. It works if used correctly, and it is quite powerful, but I cant figure out how to make it safe.p  pAlso keep in mind that this rule only applies to what I term propagating node subtypes. A propagating node subtype is one that has a operate and virtual operateThis. A turret isnt necessarily a vessel even though it can be attached as a child of a vessel for example. But the fact that a Vessel is renderable mandates that a Turret is renderable.p  pSo the title to this question and the previous statement you can attach a child node to a parent node only if the childs type is derived from the parent or is the same as the parent isnt quite accurate. Through multiple inheritance an object is composed of an agglomeration of different types, so I want to ensure that only the propagating types actually propagate through the sceneGraph.p

Negative 28655 pI have an codeEmployeecode table in the database and in my application I need to find codeEmployeecode by name, phone, email and other filters. I end up having a lot of business methods, that correspond to DAL methods for codeGetEmployeeByName, GetEmployeeByEmail, GetEmployeeByPhonecode etc. p  pI was thinking why not create an codeEmployeeFiltercode class like this p  precodeEmployeeFilter     public string Phone    public string Email    public string Name  codepre  pAnd pass this to codeGetEmployeecode stored procedure as XML. In the procedure, I can have the where clause conditional based on what the filter is set to.p  pThe upside is that it cuts down a lot of code in the BI layer. This is an example I mentioned, I have other objects that have many methods like this. I guess the downside is the conditions in the stored procedure. But to me this is still more readable design.p  pOf course I wont be able to use EF or ORM solutions. Please advise.p

In exploring this problem I came up with the following codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  template lttypename Tgt class BaseClass  public     virtual void print1 T thing          stdcout ltlt Base print1  ltlt thing ltlt stdendl           virtual void print2 T thing          stdcout ltlt Base print2  ltlt thing ltlt stdendl        class IntClass  public BaseClassltintgt  public     void print2 int thing          stdcout ltlt Int print2  ltlt thing ltlt stdendl        int main      BaseClassltintgt thing  IntClass     thing.print11     thing.print21      IntClass thing2  IntClass     thing2.print12     thing2.print22      return 0  codepre  pMy expected output would bep  precodeBase print1 1 Int print2 1 Base print1 2 Int print2 2 codepre  pBut instead, I getp  precodeBase print1 1 Base print2 1 Base print1 2 Int print2 2 codepre  pIs it possible to achieve my goal here, or am I better off creating separate base classes for each type in this case  Apologies if my terminology is a bit off  I am relatively new to C.p

This is the link from which i got this understanding a hrefhttpmarkashleybell.combuildingasimplegooglechromeextension.html relnofollowhttpmarkashleybell.combuildingasimplegooglechromeextension.htmla. If you want i can share the actual code also but it is going to crowd the question.p  pI think I can make get the selected text to go in to the database if i use contextmenus. But this is what i intend to do is p  ol liselect the textli liA icon comes up Hstrongow do i trigger the jquery to add the button, which chrome api i need to use and in which file i should put the codestrong 3 On clicking the icon the text gets highlighted. stronghow should i change the DOM of the current pagestrongli ol  pI can do the part of extracting the text and sending it to the Database. p  pThe next problem i have no idea about what information I need to store in the database Example do i need to store the start or end node so that i can have the text highlighted when i return to the URl. strongHow does a chrome extension start on its own to figure out what part of the page need to be highlighted.strong p  pIn case you have a sample code that will be great or just tell me what is the logic and chrome apis i need to use.p  pI know the question is too broad but even if you have a few links that can help to understand this flow it will be great. strongThe project i am working on it to create a far similar version of a hrefhttpswww.diigo.com relnofollowhttpswww.diigo.coma, with just the ability to store URL along with the highlighted notes.strongp

There are smart card operations available that can be used for signing and decrypting with a private key on the card to proove the app has got access to the private key.p  hr  pThe question I need to know the answer for is, if there is a way of establishing TLS connection on iOS using either objectivec, C or C where a reference to a private key itself is not needed, but the connection can be established by signing a piece of given data with the private key and returning the signed piece of data when needed  Can you please provide me with some ideas or examples of how could this be done.

There are DATETIME type too in mysql.

Negative 28655 pMy task it to rewrite a R function in C to accelerate the while loops. All R codes has been rewritten in the help of Rcpp and Armadillo except the .Fortran .

Negative 28655 pI am using the QML codeMapItemViewcode component with a C codeQAbstractListModelcodebased model. The codeMapItemViewcode is working fine when the model is reset, or whenever a new item is added or an existing item is removed.

Negative 28655 pIm currently trying to implement a simple timeseries database using codeSQLAlchemycode. And so far Ive seen the need for the following classes First off is the codePlatformcode class which is the highest in the hierarchyp  precodeimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import datetime from sqlalchemy import createengine, Column, Integer, String, Float, ForeignKey, TIMESTAMP from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarativebase from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relation, backref  engine  createenginesqlitememory, echoFalse Base  declarativebase Session  sessionmakerbindengine session  Session  class PlatformORMBase     tablename  platforms      platformid  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue     platformname  ColumnString, uniqueTrue      subfunds  relationshipFundORM, backrefplatform      def initself, platformname         self.platformname  platformname      def reprself         return ltPlatformname  sgt  self.platformname codepre  pNext, comes the codeFundORMcode class, which is linked to the codePlatformORMcode class. Such that an instance of codePlatformORMcode can have several subfunds.p  precodeclass FundORMBase     tablename  funds      fundid  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue     platformid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeyplatforms.platformid     fundname  ColumnString, uniqueTrue      def initself, fundname         self.fundname  fundname      def reprself         return ltFund names, Platform IDsgt  self.fundname, self.platformid codepre  pUsing only these two classes its easy to link them. However, I now wish to add another class called codeTimeseriesTypeORMcode, which is linked to codeFundORMcode and describes the different types of timeseries that codeFundORMcode has, it could for example be returns or spot price. This is defined such asp  precodeclass TimeseriesTypeORMBase     tablename  timeseriestypes      platformid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeyplatforms.platformid     fundid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeyfunds.fundid     tstypeid  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue     tstypename  ColumnString      fund  relationshipFundORM, backreftstypes      def initself, tstypenameNone         self.tstypename  tstypename      def reprself         return ltTypes, Fund IDs, Platform IDsgt  self.tstypename, self.fundid, self.platformid codepre  pFurthermore, Id like to create another called codeTimeseriesORMcode, which is linked to codeTimeseriesTypeORMcode, containing the actual data of timeseries. The class is defined as p  precodeclass TimeseriesORMBase     tablename  timeseries      platformid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeyplatforms.platformid     fundid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeyfunds.fundid     tstypeid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeytimeseriestypes.tstypeid     tsid  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue      date  ColumnTIMESTAMP     value  ColumnFloat      def initself, dateNone, valueNone         self.date  date         self.value  value      def reprself         return ltDates, Fund IDsgt  self.date, self.fundid codepre  pAs an example, assume that we have a platform called codeABCcode, and that codeABCcode has a fund called codeDBEcode. Now codeDBEcode in turn has some data for returns and spot price. Then Id like to be able to filter the timeseries for returns and the fund codeDBEcode. I can thus instantiate the classes above using platform as codeABCcode, fund as codeDBEcode, type of timeseries is codespotcode, such as p  precodeplatform  PlatformORMABC fund  FundORMDBE platform.subfunds  [fund]  session.addplatform session.addfund session.commit  tstype  TimeseriesTypeORMspot fund.tstypes  [tstype]  session.addtstype session.commit codepre  pI can run the above code just fine, however, if I try to view codetstypecode, Itll showp  precodeltTypespot, Fund ID1, Platform IDNonegt codepre  pwhere codePlatform IDcode should be 1. I really cant figure out where Im going wrong  but a guess is somewhere in the relation for codeFundORMcode. Do you guys have any ideasp

Negative 28655 pHi my question is simplep  pI try to establish an UDP connection via a TCP connection Because multiple clients are connected via multiple channels to the server and I want to identifiy same clients via the main TCP connectionp  pI did this by creating a TCP and UDP Socket on the client and transmit the local UDP port assigned randomly by the OS via TCP to the server. On Windows I get the port after sendto via getsocketname. On the server I use this port to send UDP packets to this exact client. Unfortunately the port i really have to send to is different to the local port i sent to the server. p  pFor examplep  pMy Client gets a local UDP port 56423 assigned. Sends it to my Server via the established TCP connection. Server tries to send UDP Packets to that port  Failed.  When i use the standard way of retreiving the port on the server via recv on the UDP socket it reports a source port of 30299. I have to send UDP packets in advance for that info, but I want to avoid implementing a UDP connection handshakep  pHow can this bep  pTo my understanding UDP just has a destination port and a source port. So it should work by sending the client local port to the server.  Can there possibly be proxy services inbetween that use alternate portsp  pEdit Some codep  pOn the client s32  int, c8  charp  precodeifmWinSock  INVALIDSOCKET     return  struct sockaddrstorage addr s32 len  sizeofsockaddr  getsocknamemWinSock, SOCKADDRampaddr, amplen c8 ipstr[INET6ADDRSTRLEN  1] s32 port ifaddr.ssfamily  AFINET      struct sockaddrin s  struct sockaddrin ampaddr     muLocalPort  ntohssgtsinport     inetntopAFINET, ampsgtsinaddr, ipstr, sizeof ipstr  else   AFINET6     struct sockaddrin6 s  struct sockaddrin6 ampaddr     muLocalPort  ntohssgtsin6port     inetntopAFINET6, ampsgtsin6addr, ipstr, sizeof ipstr  codepre  pmuLocalPort is transmitted via TCP after that.p  pOn the serverp  precode    SOCKADDRIN address     ZeroMemoryampaddress, sizeofaddress     address.sinaddr  addrin     address.sinport  htonsu16remoteport     address.sinfamily  AFINET codepre  premoteport is the port sent by the client.p  pUsing this code on the server after sending a packet from the clientp  precodestruct sockaddrstorage addr s32 len  sizeofsockaddr s32 bytes  recvfrommWinSock, mRecvBuffer, NETMAXUDPSIZE, 0, SOCKADDRampaddr, amplen mRecvAddress  struct sockaddrin ampaddr  s32 port  ntohsmRecvAddress.sinport printfrecv from port in, port codepre  pI receive a totally different port.p

Negative 28655 pBasically Im drawing on an image and the drawings that I take can sometimes contain elements that dont fit inside of the array that Im pushing to the screen. Ive tried using codenumpy.clipcode on the arrays before adding adding them in to my main array but this seems far too slow to be acceptable.p  pIs there any way to just disable the exceptions the elements that are outside of the range arent important at all and can be safely lost Note that I dont think that I can just catch the exception as that seems to stop the drawing at that point which means that any rows below the one containing an element outside of the screen will just be lost and this is not acceptable.p  pTo further clarify, I have an array representing an output to the screen which matches the starting window resolution. It is width x height and each element specifies the color at that pixel. Im using a modified version of scikitimage to create circles. These circles may contain points that are outside of the bounds of the screen but Im drawing them so often that I cant afford the time at least with codenumpy.clipcode required to clean any elements out of the array that are outside of the screen.p  pI would like to just stop numpy from throwing exceptions when an index out of range exception occurs and instead just continue on with the rest of the array.p

Negative 28655 pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewperformancescaleoutwithsqlserver relnofollowScaleout with SQL Servera you can use SignalR.SqlServer to keep SignalR synced on a load balancing setup. I have an existing MVC 5 website with its own database created using Entity Code First. The article seems to use a dedicated database with service broker enabled and says not to modify the database. p  pSo do I need to have a separate database for this I know Entity can be picky if the database schema doesnt match and I worry that if I try to use the SignalR Sql Server package with the existing database that the tables it creates will cause a context changed error.p  pAlso can someone provide me with more information about using the Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.SqlServer package. The article I linked doesnt give a ton of detail and I dont know if I need to change anything in my hub and groups or if it is all handled automatically. p

This is my grid, obviously this positioning on mobile is correct and on small and bigger horrible since I havent done push and pullp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm4gt1ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm4gt2ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm5gt3ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm3gt4ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm8gt5ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm4gt6ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs12 colsm12gt7ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is the following a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1rVnN.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com1rVnN.pngap  precode[      2      ][              5               ] [      1      ][         3         ][    4    ] [      6      ][         3         ][    4    ] [                      7                      ] codepre  pI hope anyone who is well experienced with this can help me build up my grid to achieve this.

Negative 28655 pI have already built a deep neural network image classifier program in Matlab gives 1 output for each example, such as is it a car or not, using gradient descent and back propagation algorithms. It is a simple feed forward network, with 1 or 2 hidden layers. Im using the obtained weights in a nvcc C for real time object detection.p  pNN training results have quite a good accuracy more than 99.9, but not enough, and can process more than 100,000 image files of size 32x32. But only problem with the Matlab code is it ends up in local minimums in each training, so requires many different trainings but its training speed is quite slow.p  pOther than my slowly working Matlab NN training code, I have triedp  p1 OpenCV 3.0.0, it probably has a a hrefhttpanswers.opencv.orgquestion71281cvmlstatmodelpredictnotworkingneuralnetworks relnofollowbuga in virtual float cvmlStatModelpredict function at the moment. So I werent able to use it properly. p  p2 Tried a hrefhttpwww.artelnics.comopennn relnofollowOpenNN with guia, but it even gets stuck during loading and training. Im still working on to fix that.p  p3 Checked a hrefhttpleenissen.dkfannwp relnofollowFANNa, but could only find one tutorial code written in C. May take quite a time for me to master it with out examples.p  p4 I had tried Theano in Python a few months ago, it was quite customizable, and has quite many tutorials. But had never tried training image files with it.p  p5 I can also transfer my Matlab code to nvcc C, and try conjugate gradients method to speed up further. But didnt try this yet, it is the last choice for me.p  pMastering in each path may take quite a big time, and I have many more different works to do too. Which path should I take, or do you have another suggestion Thank youp
