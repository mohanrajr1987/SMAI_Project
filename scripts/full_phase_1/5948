Positive 5948 pOk, my first question in these forums Ill do my best.p  pIm trying to connect an Arduino Uno to VirtualBox v5.04 on COMx where the Arduino is a detected USB device and the filter applied in the USB settings for the virtual machine. The problem I have is that when I attempt to start the guest OS Ubuntu 14.04, same as host, I receive an error stating p  pIoctl failed for serial host device devttyACM0 VERRDEVIOERROR. The device will not work properly p  pErrorID DrvHostSerialFail Severity Warningp  pWhen the device is set to COM1 it eventually boots, though slowly though much faster if on another com port. However, even when the device is eventually seen in the guest os, the Arduino IDE doesnt work as expected I presume, given the warning. There are no blinking lights on the Arduino that suggest coms are occuring, for instance.p  pDMESG on the guest OS shows the Arduino as a recognized device. The Arduino IDE shows a connected device on devttyS1 I believe I had com2 when I checked this. p  pMy user in both the guest and host os the guest OS is also a Vagrant box, if that is helpful are members of the dialout group, if that is helpful.p  pWell, thats a start. If anyone has any notion, Id gladly report any settings to help me troubleshoot this. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 5948 pIm borrowing a hrefhttpwww.pjrc.comteensytdlibsEncoder.html relnofollowPJRCs Encoder librarya to manage a stepperpowered syringe pump I am running off a a hrefhttpswww.sparkfun.comproducts12757 relnofollowSparkfun RedBoarda and a a hrefhttpswww.sparkfun.comproducts12859 relnofollowBigEasy Drivera.p  pIve been developing the program modularly, defining lowerlevel classes first and working up from there. It is my emdesireem that higherlevel classes take instances of lower classes as properties.

Id appreciate guidance on how to either properly pass an active Encoder object to Pump, or how to properly initialize an Encoder object within Pump without freaking out the compiler.p

To switch back      to using DHCP, call the setDHCP function again only needs      to be called once.         uint32t ipAddress  cc3000.IP2U32192, 168, 1, 19   uint32t netMask  cc3000.IP2U32255, 255, 255, 0   uint32t defaultGateway  cc3000.IP2U32192, 168, 1, 1   uint32t dns  cc3000.IP2U328, 8, 4, 4   if cc3000.setStaticIPAddressipAddress, netMask, defaultGateway, dns      Serial.printlnFFailed to set static IP     while1          Optional Revert back from static IP addres to use DHCP.

I get an error blockquoteUser has not given permission to accessoryblockquote Which eventually means that currently only one app can use the accessory.p  pHow can this be solved Or maybe, as an alternative, would it be better if all the USB accessoryrelated functions, data etc are processed through something completely independent maybe a service and then returned back to the specific appp

Positive 5948 pquestion In my Arduino  main loop, the interrupt must always enabled to process some events.  At the same time the there are heavy IO with USB port using Serial.print.  But the IO also uses interrupt.  Some times they cause conflict and hang the program, some time not.  The events are not predictable.  So what I can do is during the IO, disable the interrupt then reenable it using noInterrupts and interrupts pair for every IO.  But this is too expansive.  Any suggestionp

Positive 5948 pI tried many times to write a code that, based on whether the lights in the current room are on or off, will make 2 RGB LEDs blink or stay on in certain ways. When the lights are on, the 2 RGBs are supposed to alternate blinking blue one second at a time. When the lights are off, both RGBs are supposed to turn on, and stay, the color red. I am using 2 RGBs, wires, a breadboard, resistors, a photoresistor, and an arduino UNO not the original, but it is a pretty close replica... you cant tell any difference between the two besides the fact that it doesnt say UNO.

By that I mean, it is codetruecode when I type in a value such as code125code, and a moment later it will be true again when I have typed in nothing additional. I only expect one value to go through this way. The result is that my codethrottlecode is being set to the value I enter, and then almost immediately reset to code0code.

Larss solution below is perfect for one exclusion as the example shows, however in my real scenario I have multiple exclusions, and adding additional dependencies for each seems smelly. The solution that seems to work is to set the scope of the shown dependency to emcompileem and then create a second dependency the same artifact mygroup.myartifact with no exclusions and the scope set to emtestem. Since Lars both answered my poorly phrased question correctly, as well as led me in the direction of the actual solution, I will mark his reply as the answer.p

Negative 5948 pIm looking for a control that I can put on top of an already existing OLAP star schema to allow the user to define their own queries and generate reports.  Right now I have some predefined reports built on top of the cubes, but Id like to allow the user to define their own criteria based on the cubes that Ive created.  Ive found lots of products that will allow you to treat a transactional table like an OLAP cube, but nothing specifically for preexisting cubes.p  pEDIT Let me be clear, I know there are countless reporting tools out there that claim to report on OLAP cubes.

I want to rely on the fact that cubes are a standardized pattern and I want a tool that takes advantage of this fact.  I want a tool that targets developers and starts with the assumption that I actually know how to manage my data, it just needs to build pretty reports for me and not crumble under the weight of my data.p

Experiments at that time indicated that it was not worth the effort, which I attributed largely to the overhead of moving data between each CPUs cache there was no shared cache back then and RAM.li liCompetitive advantage  some of our customers can never get enough performance and there is no doubt that we can build a faster product using TPL today.li liIt sounds fun. Yes, I realize that some developers would rather poke themselves in the eye with a sharp stick, but we really enjoy maximizing performance.li ul  h2Why Waith2  ul liAre todays Intel Nehalem CPUs representative of where we are going as multicore support matures You can purchase a Nehalem CPU with 4 cores which share a single level 3 cache today, and most likely a 6 core CPU sharing a single level 3 cache by the time Visual Studio 2010  .NET 4.0 are released. Obviously, the number of cores will go up over time, but what about the architecture As the number of cores goes up, will they still share a cache One issue with Nehalem is the fact that, even though there is a very fast interconnect between the cores, they have nonuniform memory access NUMA which can lead to lower performance and less predictable results. Will future multicore architectures be able to do away with NUMAli liSimilarly, will the .NET Task Parallel Library change as it matures, requiring modifications to code to fully take advantage of itli ul  h2Limitationsh2  ul liOur core engine is 100 C and has to run without full trust, so we are limited to using .NET APIs.li ul

Negative 5948 pI need to returnupdate a boolean while returning a list of stuff from a method.  Java cant return tuples and I didnt want to make a separate class for this, so figured I would pass the bool as an out param.  Thats what our C client does, passes bool by reference.  That would work for a normal class since java sort of has passbyref for objects see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions40480isjavapassbyreferencehttpstackoverflow.comquestions40480isjavapassbyreferencea for a good discussion of this.  But the Wrapper classes like Boolean store their primitive value as immutable, so it cant be updated in this way. p  pUsing a boolean array with one entry seems hokey but is perhaps the simplest thing that works.  Alternatively, could return the boolean and pass the created list back as an out param rather than as the return [but then the java client deviates from the C, and its best if they keep mostly the same approach FYI need this in C too.]p

Negative 5948 pPlaying with the strongsshstrong and strongpublickeystrong application in Erlang, Ive discovered a nice strongfeaturestrong.p  pI was trying to connect to my running Erlang SSH daemon by using a strongrsa keystrong, but the authentication was failing and I was prompted for a password.p  pAfter some debugging and tracing and a couple of coffees, Ive realized that, for some weird reason, a non valid key for my user was there. The strongauthorizedkeysstrong file contained strongtwo keysstrong. The wrong one was at some point in the file, while the correct one was appended at the end of the file.p  pNow, the Erlang SSH application, when diffing the provided key with the ones contained in the authorizedkeys, it was finding the first entry completely ignoring the second on  the correct one. Then, it was switching to different authentication mechanism at first it was trying emdsaem instead of emrsaem and then it was prompting for a password.p  pstrongThe question is Is this behavior intended or should the SSH server check for multiple entries for the same user in the authorizedkeys file Is this a generic SSH behaviour or its just specific to the Erlang implementationstrongp

Negative 5948 pIm developing a html5 browser multiplayer RPG with node.js running in the backend with a web sockets plugin for client data transfer. The problem im facing is accessing and updating user data, as you can imagine this process will be taking place many times a second even with few users connected.p  pIve done some searching and found only 2 plugins for node.js that enable MySQL capabilities but they are both in early development and Ive figured that querying the database for every little action the user makes is not efficient.p  pMy idea is to get node.js to access the database using PHP when a user connects and retrieve all the information related to that user. The information collected will then be stored in an JavaScript object in node.js. This will happen for all users playing. Updates will then be applied to the object. When a user logs off the data stored in the object will be updated to the database and deleted from the object.p  pA few things to note are that I will separate different types of data into different objects so that more commonly accessed data isnt mixed together with data that would slow down lookups. Theoretically if this project gained a lot of users I would introduce a cap to how many users can log onto a single server at a time for obvious reasons.p  pI would like to know if this is a good idea. Would having large objects considerably slow down the node.js server If you happen to have any ideas on another possible solutions for my situation I welcome them.p  pThanksp

Negative 5948 pI have a table containing roles.  Many users can be assigned to a role.  Permissions can be assigned to a role, granting all users to that role with the permission.p  pWhen I assign a permission to a role that has 500 hundred people, Ive effectively created 500 permission assignments.p  pWith each permission that is assigned to a role I specify a complex calculation that must take place when determining what type of permission access each individual with that role has.  For example, if I assign a READEMAIL permission to an ACCOUNTANT role, at the time I do that I also include a variable that specifies which mailbox types are being permitted, as there are multiple mailbox types and the accountants should only have access to a certain group of them.p  pSo when I want to find out which individuals have access to which specific mailboxes I have to not only join my permissions, roles and users tables, but I need to do a lookup that for reasons which are hard to explain in the space here is time consuming and cannot be made faster.p  pThe problem I run into is that when I expose all calculated permission assignments in a view joining all those tables  doing the complex, timeconsuming calculation, it takes a very very long time.p  pIt occurred to me that I could simply create a userrolepermission table which is populated via triggers activated by assigning a user to a role or by assigning a permission to a role.  Whenever a permission is assigned to a role it would insert a record for each individual having that role and would do the complex lookup at that time, putting 500 records into this table.  Whenever a user is assigned to a role it would generate any permissions  complex lookups.  There would be foreign keys from this table to the role assignment table and the permission assignment tables, with cascading deletes.p  pPermission to role assignment is rare, so its fine if that is slowed down greatly.  99.99999 of the access to my tables is SELECT.p  pAny drawbacks to this method  I need realtime data.  Am I just engineering my own oncommit materialized view  Any other suggestionsp

Negative 5948 pI recently began importing a number of our projects into a Subversion repository at work and over the next few weeks im expecting every one on the team to take responsibility for their own source control management.p  pThe reason I chose SVN over GIT is that I want strongeveryonestrong on the team, including designers, frontenders, integrators... to take charge of their own SCM and so im expecting things will move quicker if they manage their work using a GUI Cornerstone for mac and Tortoise SVN for windows. I know there are some GIT GUIs out there, SmartGit looks most appealing at the minute, but none seem as capable as their SVN counterparts. Besides, I feel wed be losing something in translation by not using the command line to work with a DVCS whereas im significantly happier using a GUI to manage projects in SVN.p  pThe problem is that distributed solutions are fast overtaking centralized solutions and so Im wondering if it would really be worth the extra investment now rather than have to migrate everything 6 months down the line and invest time in a DVCS anyway The other way to look at it is that SVN would be a relatively painless step in the meantime which would prepare us more adequately should we later decide to migrate to a DVCS.p  pYour thoughts and experiences are appreciated.p  pAside for a number of reasons, I prefer multiple projects per SVN repository. This, though, means less meaningful statistics from Atlassians Fisheye, as well as being messier. If we did decide to use GIT it would be 1 repository per project. p

Negative 5948 pI have a database which uses unique text keys to link between objects.  For example, when users are inserted they are inserted with the text key datesystemuser where each element of the key is alphanumeric.  This is then checked against a look up table to see if it exists, if not it is inserted into a table and an autoincrement integer key created. Otherwise the same integer key is reused.p  pThen, if a unique attribute of that user is inserted, it is matched and assigned the users numeric key as the foreign key.  For instance, a document unique to this user is inserted with a user key datesystemuser and a unique text key for the document datesystemuserdocument from which an integer key is generated.p  pIn this way, there is a numeric key associating these two entries and the document has a unique key for attaching attributes to it.  These are used in various queries.p  pThe problem is the keys, of course, are not the same across systems depending on how and when the elements were inserted.  So, my initial thought was to use a hash as the generated key, but int and bigint are fairly limited, I think.  p  pIm not sure how SQL server will handle long strings of hashes for foreign keys, I have read it does not do it well in terms of performance.  Otherwise, I could just use the text that is creating the key itself.p  pHow would you go about making sure the int, bigint or string if plausible keys are unique across systems, assuming the text key is unique  A hash  A GUID  How could hash collisions be handled if a bigint 63 bits bit key were used, if at allp  pThanksp

Negative 5948 pWe just recently upgraded from VS2005 to VS2010. Ive noticed that unlike VS2005, when debugging code and the VS2010 IDE encounters an Invalid Cross Thread operation, the IDE simply terminates the application without breaking on the line of code that is causing the problem.  p  pI looked into the Debug  Exceptions section of the IDE, but I didnt find Invalid Cross Thread Operation as a valid option under the System.Threading namespace.  I am kinda lost at how to get the VS2010 IDE to behave like the VS2005 IDE, where it would break code and highlight the line causing an invalid crossthread operation.p  pCan anyone help me out herep

Negative 5948 pWhats the best approach to create a hierarchy of portal p  plets make Computer as an example. Computer would be the Parent of all portals. Computer will be having a subportalchild like Laptop, Desktop and Printers. Then for each child it would also have another subportalchild like HP Laptop, Lenovo Laptop or HP Desktop etc.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyu8kZ.jpg altenter image description herep  pFor every portal it would have different look and feel. Some of the portal will share portlet and content from each other. example USB Products will borrow portlets from IBM Desktop or Brothers Printers will borrow content from HP Laptop. p  pAny user of the Portal can access all those portal without signingup again. That means a user from HP Printers can access HP Laptops. Each Portal is an individual of each own, it will have its own domain But at the backend they share portlets and other resources.p  pI hope this make sense.p  pWhats the best way to do it p  pIs it creating a Portal Instancep  por it should be in Organizationp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5948 pI have a codeUITableViewControllercode that Id like to notify once the data of the corresponding model is ready to be displayed. The problem is that this data is fetched from a web service and the request can take up to several seconds. Currently, Im fetching the data synchronously on the main thread which, of course, causes my main thread to block. Now, I dont want my controller to know anything about downloading data from the internet. How can I accomplish this. Currently, Im thinking about utilizing GCD and implementing a method like codeloadDataWithCallbackcode and provide a callback that triggers a code[tableView reloadData]code on success. Is this a good approach Are there other possibilities to notify a controller that the model is ready An other idea I had was to use a delegate mechanism and setting the controller as a delegate of my modelp  pTo summarize, whats better GCD with callbacks or implementing your own delegate mechanismp  pAre there other possibilitiesp  hr  pemUpdateem June, 24th 2011 1315 CETp  pAfter reading all your replies, I come to the conclusion that there are 3 possible solutions to my problemp  ol lipMake use of codeNSNotificationscode and use codeNSURLConnectioncode to implement async. downloadpli lipImplement a custom protocol and use a delegation mechanism. Again, use codeNSURLConnectioncode to implement async. download.pli lipUse synchronous download in a separate GCD queue and use callbacks.pli ol  pSince nobody favors the last solution, I want to discuss this approach a little in depth. After seeing all the code that is involved in notification handling, I think that GCD is a better approach. Instead of agreeing on a certain notification which has to be somehow documented, so that every developer knows about it, I can simply use a callback. On the one hand, it gives me a clear interface like one I would have when I would use a delegate, on the other hand, it give me total flexibility. Do you really think that GCD is to complicated for this Here is my codep  precode voidloadRestaurantsWithCallbackvoid callback      dispatchqueuet currentqueue  dispatchgetcurrentqueue     dispatchqueuet downloadqueue  dispatchqueuecreateDownload queue, NULL      dispatchasyncdownloadqueue,          self.restaurants  [self loadRestaurants]         dispatchasynccurrentqueue,  callback            dispatchreleasedownloadqueue  codepre  pBtw., my application simply displays the menus of the different canteens at my university.p  pIn my controller, I simply do the followingp  precodeif [self.canteen hasRestaurants]      [self.canteen loadRestaurantsWithCallback         [self.tableView reloadData]     ]  codepre  pIt works like a charm. What do you think about this solutionp  hr  pemUpdateem June, 24th 2011 1630 CETp  pThere is a fourth solution to this problem and its probably the way to go even if it involves more code than the GCD approach.

When I activate that line and run the script against Selenium server like thisp  precodepy.test newseleniumtest.py codepre  pI get an error like thisp  precodeAttributeError selenium object has no attribute assertsomething codepre  pAny idea why Selenium IDE comments out my custom call, and why it does not execute it from Pythonp  pNote that I have started the Selenium server like thisp  precodejava jar seleniumserverstandalone2.0rc2.jar userExtensions pathuserextensions.js codepre  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 5948 pI have a general question about large inmemory objects and distributed computing.p  pI have a large object like Class.Object that stores a lot of data like upwards of 200,000 objects and counting. As it is right now is a simple object created and running in memory and the clients call the data in it. Because speed is also important, Im serializing this monster into the desk like C BinaryFormatter and loading and running them. This is a WCF project so the object stays in the memory. My question is how should I scale this across multiple server kind of like distributed computing. Is there a tool in C like database sharding or something like that. Is there a database that I can save this information to. This object isnt just like a simple database table. It has references up and down the classes. Everything is being referenced. There are hashtables etc. Google seems to do this kind of monster indexes using shards and splitting the data across different servers. Is there a tool and mechanism to do this in .NET. What is the approach here Im using Windows Server AppFabric to save it in memory and load it, but it seems like I need to split this monster object into piecesp  pAny pointers and help is appreciated.p

Negative 5948 pMy application uses MongoDB as database. We are expecting 20K simultaneous connections to mongodb cluster. How should I config the server if I want to run the mongodb on 20 servers and shard the cluster 20 waysp  pHere is what Ive done so far On each of my 20 servers, I have one mongos router running on port 30000, and on 3 servers I run mongo config servers on port 20000. Then on each server, I run 3 instances of mongod. One of the is the primary. In order words, I have 20 mongos, 3 mongoconfig, 60 mongod servers 20 primary and 40 replica.p  pThen in my application which also run on each server and connect to the localhost30000 mongos, I set the mongoOptions such that the connectionsPerHost  1000.p  p1015 minutes after all services start, some of them became no longer sshable. These servers are still pingable. I suspect there were too many connections, and it caused the server to die.p  pMy own analysis is as follows 1K connections per connection pool means for each shards primary, it will have 1K  20 shards  20K simultaneous connections open. A few servers will probably have more than one primary running on it, which will double or triple the number of connections to 60K. Somehow mongod cannot handle these many connections although I changed my system settings to allow each process to open way more files.p  h2Here are what ulimit a showsh2  precodecore file size blocks, c 0 data seg size kbytes, d unlimited scheduling priority e 20 file size blocks, f unlimited pending signals i 16382 max locked memory kbytes, l 64000000 max memory size kbytes, m unlimited open files n 320000 pipe size 512 bytes, p 8 POSIX message queues bytes, q 819200 realtime priority r 0 stack size kbytes, s 8192 cpu time seconds, t unlimited max user processes u unlimited virtual memory kbytes, v unlimited file locks x unlimited codepre  pBTW, I didnt specify maxConns when I start up mongodmongos, I also didnt change MONGO.POOLSIZE.p  pA side question if my reasoning is correct, the total number of simultaneous connection requirement will be posed on each primary, which doesnt seem right to me, it almost means mongodb cluster is not scalable at all. Someone tell me Im wrong pleasep

The child should then have a comment button which can then add a new record as a subchild etc.p  pThe problem is I am stuck, so any help would be much appreciated.p  precodeltPHP Updategt ltphp  con  mysqlconnectlocalhost,root,  if con  dieCould not connect  . mysqlerror   mysqlselectdbproject1, con  if GET[action]deleteok  elseif GET[action]editok  elseif GET[action]commentok     switchGET[action] case writeok  errorfalse  msg  ifPOST[dateofbirth]  pregmatch 1920dd[ .]0[19]1[012][       .]0[19][12][09]3[01],POST[dateofbirth]     errortrue     msg.Date of birth is required and in the correct format 0000.00.00n         ifPOST[gender]     errortrue     msg.Gender is a required fieldn     ifPOST[title]      errortrue      msg.Please select your titlen    ifPOST[firstname]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter your First Namen    ifPOST[lastname]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter your Last Namen    ifPOST[address1]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter the first line of your addressn    ifPOST[city]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter your city of residencen        ifPOST[postcode] pregmatch [APRUWYZ09][AHKY09][AEHMNPRTVXY09][ABEHMNPRVWXY09] 1,2[09][ABDHJLNUWZ]2GIR 0AA,POST[postcode]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter a Valid Postcoden    ifPOST[contactno] pregmatch 44sd4d5sd644s07d3sd6,POST[contactno]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter your Contact Non    ifPOST[email] pregmatch [az09][.][][az09][az09][][az09].[az]2,3.[az]2,6,POST[email]      errortrue      msg.Please Enter a Valid Email Addressn     iferror      echo ltscriptgtalert.msg.history.backltscriptgt  else  sql  INSERT INTO projectdata DateOfBirth, Gender, Title, FirstName, LastName, AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City, Postcode, ContactNo, Email, AdditionalComment VALUES .POST[dateofbirth].,.POST[gender].,.POST[title].,.POST[firstname].,.POST[lastname].,.POST[address1].,.POST[address2].,.POST[city].,.POST[postcode].,.POST[contactno].,.POST[email].,.POST[note].     ifmysqlquerysql,con          dieError  . mysqlerror          else         echo ltscriptgtalertData Has Been Successfully Updatedltscriptgt         echo ltmeta httpequivRefresh content0URLpv.phpgt        break case editok     id  GET[id]      mysqlqueryUPDATE projectdata SET DateOfBirth.POST[dateofbirth].,Gender.POST[gender].,Title.POST[title].,FirstName.POST[firstname].,LastName.POST[lastname].,AddressLine1.POST[address1].,AddressLine2.POST[address2].,City.POST[city].,Postcode.POST[postcode].,ContactNo.POST[contactno].,Email.POST[email].,AdditionalComment.POST[note].

Negative 5948 pI have the following situation I need to make synchronized Ajax requests within a loop and display the returned result after each iteration in a divelement appended on top with the previous results at the bottom. The response time of each request can be different but the order in which it should be displayed should be the same as issued. Here is an example with 3 requests. Lets say request A needs 3 seconds, B needs 1 second and C needs 5 seconds. The order I want to display the result is A, B, C as the requests were issued but the code I use shows the results in B, A, C. p  pHere is the code JQuery Ajax requestp  precodedocument.readyfunction    var json  document.getElementByIdhCategories.value   var categories  eval   json       forcurCat in categories      curCatKey  categories[curCat][grKey]      .ajax       type POST,       url getresults.php,       data category  escapecurCatKey               ampsearch  escapehQuery.val,       timeout 8000,       async false,         success functiondata          content.appenddata            codepre  pI thought it would work with asyncfalse but then it waits until every Ajax call is finished and presents the results after the loop. I hope some of you can point out some different solutions, I am pretty much stuck. p  pThanks in advance,  Cheers Chrisp  pEDIT Thanks for all the possible solutions, I will try these now one by one and come back with that one that fits my problem. p

Negative 5948 pDuring a job interview I had some time ago I was asked to calculate the number of positive i.e. set to 1 bits in a bitvectorstructure like unsigned integer or long.

The brute force solution with using the potential row of 2 like 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc wouldnt do either.p  pDoes somebody know such an algorithm p  pAs far as I understood, it should be a sort of more or less generic algorithm which does not depend upon the size of the input bit vector. All other bitwise operations and any math functions are allowed.p

Currently Im in need of developing a multiview application for iPhone as well as iPad.p  pstrongMy Researchstrongp  pIve been doing some research on development of multiview applications, and have found that the general approach is to use one of the provided controllers as a root view controller the UI tab bar controller and so on. Either that, or to write your own root view controller.p  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pThe specific problem Im battling right now is mostly concerning how to build up a more complex application which consists ofp  pA login view this is the very first view presented to the user upon opening the app The rest of the application which should be navigated using an UI tab bar controllerp  pWhat Ive come up with right now is this ideap  pCreate a custom root view controller. This root view controller will first present the login view to the user by adding the login view as a subview of itself. After login, it should change the subview to the UI tab bar controller.p  pstrongThe actual questionstrongp  pMy question then is if this is an acceptable approach of doing it Basically I would have a root view controller which switches between views by adding those views as subviews of it self.p  pI havent been able to really find any article that discuss acceptable ways of doing it. And my concern with my current idea is that having a main root view controller which basically contains all views of the application and switches between them could quickly become messyp  pAny input would be appriciated p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5948 pI know the answer is it depends. Im finding with some operations that removing the eagerloading is actually improving performance, both on my LM and on AppHarbor still not yet tested on Azure.p  pIn the cases I have tried so far, the root entity is not being queried by its primary key. The primary key is an int, but these queries go against Guid candidate keys to obfuscate the int pk from URLs. I do not have a key or index on the Guid, the only key other than fks is the int pk, and it is clustered.p  pMight eager loading be faster with a nonclustered index on the Guid candidate keyp

The web form will show all the tags that have been used before with checkboxes, and give the user the option to add a new tag which will appear as a new checkbox next to the existing ones.p  pPROBLEM 1 Right now the tags are separated by 1 space, but Id like them to be separated by a larger gap so that it looks better. What is the best way to do thisp  pPROBLEM 2 As more tags are added, they will eventually reach the right edge of this fieldset. What is the best way to make them wrap to the next line and ensure that the spaces between the new tag and the previous one are ignored Otherwise the new tag might be indented on the next line which I do not wantp  pTHE HTML CODEp  precodeltpgt     ltfieldsetgt         ltlegendgtTagsltlegendgt         ltspan classtagsgt             ltinput typecheckbox nametags valueDessertgtDessert  ltinput typecheckbox nametags valueFastgtFast  ltinput typecheckbox nametags valueEntreegtEntree         ltspangt         ltpgt             ltinput typetext idaddtaggtltinput typesubmit valueAddgt         ltpgt     ltfieldsetgt ltpgt codepre  pTHE JAVASCRIPTp  precodeinput[valueAdd].clickfunctionevent     event.preventDefault     tagAdded  document.getElementByIdaddtag.value     if tagAddednull ampamp tagAdded.trim          .tags.append        codepre  pThank youp

Negative 5948 pI know there must be a lot of people out there doing this. p  pWorking on a project using neo4J. Lets say I have an entity called Photo. Now its out on the internet and a million people like it. Putting those million likes into a graph and then navigating that graph to compute the aggregate so I can show the count seems stupid. Of course, indexes could make this more efficient, especially if the indexes are used in computing the aggregates as they are in SQL, but much hunting around makes me think this is not the case. Of course, many of the aggregates are just relation counts at specific nodes, but this still seems wrong for instance, having a graph relation going from the Photo to the Like event seems ugly.p  pPerhaps the best approach is to just use the graph db for what its good for and then for things like events, put them in a SQL db. One counter argument might be that I could go to all that trouble then want an aggregate like how many friends of friends liked this and I am right back in the graphs backyard.p  pThe choices that are out there seem to be either a hrefhttpneo4j.orgnabblenabbletd3317720 relnofollowwrite some javaa or a bunch of cipher queries.p
Negative 5948 pWith considerable time and effort, I installed openinviter as suggested by some posts on SO to get contact info from user address books  However, Ive since discovered that others here and elsewhere on the web consider openinviter out of date.  It is working for me for gmailthough I havent tested every providerbut most posts on the site are from a year or two ago.  Im reluctant to spend a lot of time integrating it if it is now unreliable and not maintained.  Some say the industry is moving toward oauth as used by cloudsponge which costs money.  Others suggest using the published apis from Gmail and a few others  I have already had one question closed on this topic as not code specific but it seems that it would be far more useful to know what people consider up to date for grabbing contacts rather what is best code to implement an out of date script.  Are there any newer, better alternatives to openinviter other than cloudsponge  From anyone doing it, what is the current best practice for getting user contacts  Many thanks.p

Negative 5948 pI am using the jMonkeyEngine Java Game Engine in Scala, which works out pretty well so far, but now I am asking myself whether there is an elegant way of overloading operators for the codeVector3fcode and similar classes. My first idea was to inherit from codeVector3fcode and overload the operators, but codeVector3fcode is final, so that is not an option. Next I thought maybe I could have a singletonscala object with static methods that operate on codeVector3fcode, like below, but that does not work eitherp  precodeobject VectorMath      def factor Float, vector Vector3f  vector.multfactor   and then somewhere import VectorMath. var v  new Vector3f1,2,3 var u  1.2f  v this does not work, because Float does not have  overloaded for Vector3f var u  VectorMath.1.2f, v this does work, but defeats the purpose codepre  pSo all I can think of now is to wrap the Vector3f in a new Scala class and delegate the operator calls to the appropriate Java methods. This has, however, three downsidesp  ol liI will have to do to a lot of back and forth conversions a codetoVector3fcode and a codefromVector3fcode method or something like that.li liThis problem becomes even worse when I have arrays of Vector3fScalaVectors. Since the classes are not related except by composition, I would have to manually cast every element of the array every time I call a method in jME. li liEven then I know of no way to overload an operator for my new ScalaVector class in such a way that I could have the factor in front, i.e. code1.2f  vcode.li ol  pMy question Can someone think of a way to make this more naturalelegant How do you tackle similar problems Or is there maybe a Scala syntax that I don know of to do these kinds of things In C I would make a global operator that takes float and Vector3f as arguments and possibly friend it. Whats the Scala way to do this, or is that simply not possiblep

Negative 5948 pI have an Rails 3.2 app, and I have one model, lets call it Car.p  pThe user inputs a series of information, and the app returns a list of suggested cars based on that information. Now, each car has a set of transient properties that a user may or may not want, such as suggested upholstery, suggested color, etc. These suggested properties are calculated on the fly based on the information the user enters. So not only does the app guess what cars the user might want, it also guesses what additional options the user might want, and stores that information transiently on the Car record. p  pThis is a pseudocodish representation of the relevant part of the Car modelp  precodedef self.suggestedcars   cars  basiccarsuserheight, userweight   addupholsterysuggestionscars, userwealth   addcolorsuggestionscars, usergender end codepre  pThe issue is that the algorithms for suggesting cars and options can return actual Car records that are not distinct. For example, one request for suggested cars can return Both Car A and Car A with leather seats. But then I have an issue, because when requesting two of the same entity from active record at the same time, both instances refer to the same object, i.e. they cant have different transient data.p  pI suspect that I might need to use the .dup method to copy objects when that happens, but I feel like there is a more elegant solution. Im open to any suggestions. Is there a common way to handle this type of situationp

Negative 5948 pIve taken over the development of a web app that uses a mysql innodb database. The client has a lot of duplicate records in the db on accident.

Negative 5948 pBelow i have two control templates that are used as cell templates for two different columns in a grid.  Youll notice that both columns are bound to the same model properties Code and Value, but use a converter to display those values differently.   Both control template also use the same Style to blink the cell when data is changed.p  pthis works, but not exactly the way i want it.  Right now, when either Data.Code or Data.Value changes, BOTH column cells Blink.  What i want is if Data.Code  CodeA, then the column using template CDisplay2 should not blink infact, it should not display anything.  And if Data.Code  CodeB, then the cell using template CDisplay1 should not blink.p  pTo achieve this it would be great if i could conditionally apply the style template based on Data.Code, but i cant figure out how to do that.

Negative 5948 pSo lets say I have two views, codeMyViewcode and codeMySubviewcode, both of which subclass codeUIViewcode.p  pView.hp  precodeinterface MyView  UIView ltProgressCallbackgt property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet UIProgressBar progress   id initWithFrame CGRect frame  void progressUpdated NSNumber newProgress  end codepre  pView.mp  precodeimplementation MyView synthesize progress  progress   idinitWithFrameCGRectframe      self  [super initWithFrameframe]      if self         NSArray arrayOfViews  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedMyViewNibFile                                                               ownernil                                                             optionsnil]          if [arrayOfViews count] lt 1             [self release]             return nil                   View newView  [[arrayOfViews objectAtIndex0] retain]         [newView setFrameframe]          [self release]         self  newView          self.progress.progress  .25  This will work and change it.           return self    void progressUpdated NSNumber newProgress       self.progress.progress  newProgress.floatValue  This also works  codepre  pI found this method of creating a subclass of UIView by browsing Apples docs and StackOverflow. It works, I can set my progress based on a callback, it appears, etc. My issue is when I want to subview this.p  pMySubview.hp  precodeinterface MySubview  MyView property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet UIImageView image end codepre  pMySubview.mp  pimplementation MySubviewp  precode idinitWithLabel UIImageView  image andWithFrameCGRectframe      self  [super initWithFrameframe]      if self         NSArray arrayOfViews  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedMySubViewNibFile                                                               ownernil                                                             optionsnil]          if [arrayOfViews count] lt 1             [self release]             return nil                   MySubbiew newView  [[arrayOfViews objectAtIndex0] retain]         [newView setFrameframe]          [self release]         self  newView          self.progress.progress  .25  This will work and change it.         self.image  image  Also works           return self  codepre  pNo matter how I initialize my subclass, I cannot get the progress bar to work in the subclass. I can set it during the init, and it is not nil, but it clearly does not correspond to the one in my view after the init. I think it has to do with the fact that I am releasing self, but I cannot see any other alternative if I want to return a class of type View. I use the same style of init, merely changing the class name to Subview. The callback actually is called and changes in code, but it does not update the display. Everything is hooked up correctly in the nibs, and they are identical except for size, and in this case, with an image.p  pI tried my best to make the example code as simple and as clear as possible. If I did not succeed, please let me know, Ill update it.p  pHow do you properly subclass UIView I read the docs, nothing proved enlightening, but please feel free to point me in the right direction. Specifically, what must I override to have everything pointing to the right items That is, the ones on the display.p

Negative 5948 pThanks to stackoverflow, I managed to implement a webview where I can save the images via a long click context menuHitTestResult.

For example, I enter the site and input a usernamepassword into a form some server side language like PHP, which brings me to some pictures. The webview has no problem in  logging in and displaying everything. But I cant save images, since the authentication  which is present in the webview  is strongnotstrong present in my image saving mechanism.p  pWith the above code I simply get a FileNotFoundException on the URL.getContent. Then I tried to use HttpClient and HttpGetHttpResponse, where the response is always code 403.p  pMy question How can I accessdownloadauthenticate to get images of protected areas may it be through  server side language or basic authentication. p  pI mean... its all there, displayed correctly and authenticated in the WebView  But theres no connection between the content of the WebView and my URLHttp Request downloading efforts. Can the webview somehow share its authentication statep  pI even thought about fetching the images from the WebView cache, because its all there. but I wasnt able to find out how to do this either.... Is there no mechanism to get the image somehow directly out of the WebViewp  pI would be thankful for any kind of helpp

Negative 5948 pMySQL uses codequicksortcode to sort the resultset when the user asks for it. Now on average, codequicksortcode has an efficiency of codeONlog Ncode, which is acceptable even though its worst case may sometimes reach codeON2code. Now that is fine for most cases, but imagine I have a column, say, pinnumber, which always has 6 digits. And a particular query fetches millions of rows and sort them based on that key. In such cases, wont the coderadixsortcode be a better option, giving a linear order Is there any way perhaps writing a plugin or something I can introduce a new MySQL function, say codemyorderbycode, which will sort the resultset based on a given key through the custom radixsort I have defined And secondly, will this tweak be worthwhilep

Negative 5948 pIve developed an app that pulls spatial data from an internal database, and generates a KML file.  It consists of some styles, a documentlevel LookAt tag for initial positioning, and a couple hundred placemarks with some custom CDATA in the baloons.

Negative 5948 pWould a process with more threads on Linux have more cpu time than a process with one threadp  pIn Linux processes and threads are described by a task struct, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8463741howlinuxhandlesthreadsandprocessschedulingscheduling is based on tasksa. I found also a hrefhttporeilly.comcataloglinuxkernelchapterch10.html relnofollowthisap  blockquote   pWhen a new process is created, codedoforkcode sets the counter field of both current the parent and p the child processes in the following wayp  precodecurrentgtcounter gtgt 1 pgtcounter  currentgtcounter codepre      pIn other words, the number of ticks left to the parent is split in two halves, one for the parent and one for the child. This is done to prevent users from getting an unlimited amount of CPU time by using the following method the parent process creates a child process that runs the same code and then kills itself by properly adjusting the creation rate, the child process would always get a fresh quantum before the quantum of its parent expires. This programming trick does not work since the kernel does not reward forks. Similarly, a user cannot hog an unfair share of the processor by starting lots of background processes in a shell or by opening a lot of windows on a graphical desktop. More generally speaking, a process cannot hog resources unless it has privileges to give itself a realtime policy by forking multiple descendants.p blockquote  pActually I didnt find that in the kernel sources, but maybe its my fault, maybe I saw wrong kernel version.p  pBut what happens later, would every thread participate in scheduling like a separate process Would a process with ten threads get ten times more ticks than a process with one thread What about IO in this sensep

Negative 5948 pUbuntu Linux How can one acquire a path that refers to the master side of abr of a pseudo terminal pair... the slave side is easy...  but the master side only seems to exist as an open file descriptor, but seems not possess a valid Linux path.p  pWith respect to the working Linux pseudo terminal example a hrefhttpwww.man7.orgtlpicodeonlineallfilesbychapter.htmlch64 relnofollowhttpwww.man7.orgtlpicodeonlineallfilesbychapter.htmlch64a  covered in the last chapter of this very good Liunx API book a hrefhttpwww.nostarch.comtlpi relnofollowhttpwww.nostarch.comtlpiap  pA questions regarding the current state of Linux linux pseudo terminal API. The example mentioned above, redirects the forkedexeced programs stdinstdoutstderr streams as required to the PTY slave...all is happy on that side of the PTY. p  pBut the pseudo terminal masters path that I need to pass as an argument to a multi tabbed terminal emulator process seems not yet to exist. p  pMy question is with regard to creating a named path forthe Master side of the pseudo terminal pair...as best as I can disern, in the example code mentioned above, only the PTY slave side actually has a name, as the PTY Master side is referred only by way of of an open file descriptor...    and when I query the master side path by way of a readlinkdevfd3... it returns the PTY master clone path devptmx, thus  I gather that the PTY Master side may not yet have a path name as of yet .. I thought I might be needing to create a valid path by calling link.... but link only takes an existing path, not an open File descriptor as its argument... so I tried calling linkdevptmx, NewPTMname refurning to the PTY cloan device hoping it might create a link to the resulting PTY master side, but that call fails, returning 1. p  pI would like to then pass this PTY Master side path string argument to the terminal emulator, perhaps by way of its command line, or in RoxTerms case possibly DBus...p  pI realize that many terminal emulator programs have a e or x argument that allows one to run a program inside of a terminal window...  Unfortunately taking this approach does not tend to leave one with much control of the parentchild process tree...   such is requred as this work is in support of a shared memory multiprocessing system.  p

But this is not crossplatform so wouldnt work on windows.p  pI dont need any socket layer tcp, udp. As all the messaging will be on the same server.p  pBasically, I have an event loop and I will block separate thread until I get a message from the message queue msgrcv. Then process that event. The messages will come from another shared library that I have created that I will monitor events from in my event loop.p  pI just want to be able to send message to the message queue msgsnd and then receive them msgrcv in my event loop.p  pMany thanks for any suggestions,p

Negative 5948 pThe last couple of months we have been busy developing a Symfony application. Aside of that we developed a Wordpress website. Now Im busy integrating the Wordpress website into the Symfony application, which Ive separated in two steps.p  pstrongStep 1strong Handling the request. Symfony2 or Wordpress should handle the incoming request. This step is important for the deployment structure of the entire application.p  pstrongStep 2strong Including Wordpress into the Symfony2 Twig templates. Because Symfony2 hasnt a CMS outofthebox.p  pThe first step went great, Ive found a quite good snippet on a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1170134 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com1170134a and implemented this into the Symfony app.php file. The wordpress installation now lives into the web directory of the Symfony installationp  pThe second step is a bit harder, and is the part I cant get fixed. The problem isnt solved by installing a WordpressBundle like a hrefhttpsgithub.comkayueWordpressBundle relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkayueWordpressBundlea . I tried starting with integrating the Wordpress footer footer.php of the template dir. My questions p  ul liHow can I make use of the Codex php functions in the Twig templates I tried it by following the Cookbook on a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoc2.0cookbooktemplatingPHP.html relnofollowhttpsymfony.comdoc2.0cookbooktemplatingPHP.htmla Is the method as explained at a hrefhttpinchoo.networdpresstwigwordpresspart2 relnofollowhttpinchoo.networdpresstwigwordpresspart2a the best solution for making use of the Codexli liHow can I include and php files into my Twig template a hrefhttptwig.sensiolabs.orgdoctagsembed.html relnofollowEmbeddinga the footer.php works, but the php does not gets executed.

Negative 5948 pI have an idea for an app on windows 8 where I have to use a server my own and send several images on daily basis to all the clients. It would also be possible to upload images from  the app to my server.p  pI have experience in app development on windows 8 and windows phone 7, only CXAML. But none of remoting services etc. My question is whether I should use a classic REST API or the newer websockets. I believe the last one has more performance.  For the record, Im not going to build a webclient. Maybe, if the app is successful, Ill port it to an Android app. I presume it would be ably to connect to the .NET service regardless of my choice Are there other important factors that can guide my decisionp  pSo which one should you use If you have a link to some good tutorials in .NET regarding REST or websockets pref. with images, not just hello world, please share p  pThanks a lot alreadyp

Howver the German users found this software stopped working from time to time, when it is installed on German computers. The temporary solution is to change the Language setting in the control panel, and it works fine after we change the language setting from German to English. This is just a kind of engineering sofware, and the software have nothing relalted to the German or English language.

Negative 5948 pI am kind of new to PHP OOP, but I have a fairly decent understanding of the concepts behind OO. I want to have a config file that has general application data that can be used from throughout the entire application. Pretty normal but I am not exactly sure how to do this. I dont want to create a class and then have require that class, extend it and or require the config file in every class. My config file looks something like thisp  precodeltphp  configs  array    pagination gt 20,    siteTitle gt Test site,    description gt This is a test description,    debug gt true   gt codepre  pThe only thing that I can think of to do for this is the followingp  precodeltphp   class user     public function construct         require config.php        ifconfigs[debug]             echo Debugging mode               gt codepre  pThe problem I see with this method is that I would have to manually include this config file in every class I want to use which seems redundant. Ideally I would like to include the file in the absolute root path and then be able to use any of the values from within any class however if you simply require a file outside of the class the class will not have access to the values. I also dont want to create a config class and then every class that needs the values have them extend the config class. Again that seems redundant. p  pNot sure if Im making much sense I just want an easy way to carry config values throughout every class and use them without having to type overly redundant code.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5948 pstrongTLDRstrong p  pMy calculator grammar relies on recursive descent to nest parentheses groups inside each other, but too many nested parens around 20 causes a stack overflow.  How can I fix this  Is there a way to make the problem more flatp  pstrongLongformstrongp  pIt wasnt long ago that  my head stuck deeply into small scale embedded systems  no person with half a brain should run into a stack overflow.  Now humbled by a much more abstract task, I come here for advice.p  pThe motivating project is a calculator for Android.  The current calculators are glaringly insufficient in so many ways, but I didnt bring my soapbox today, so Ill just get straight to the problem Im running into stack overflowsp  pSpecifically, when the user creates too many nested parentheses groups, including functions and such.  This occurs because my calculator relies on an codeANTLRcode grammar, meaning it uses recursive descent.  Conveniently, this allows for it to run continuously through PEMDAS, allowing calculation of nested functions and parentheses easy.  But  I found that  depending on the phone  pressing the parens button 20 or so times caused a crash, caused by a stack overflow stemming from a call stack about 100 function calls deep, a natural result of the recursive descent method.p  pI know, flat is better than nested, but 4 of the levels functions it goes down through are completely necessary, and a couple of the other levels make my life logarithmically easier.  Even removing these levels wouldnt solve the problem the user would still be able to cause the system to crash within a couple minutes.  Having a too many parens error message is bad its something one of the other calculators would do.  Also, I use the AST output to format the input string to make it rill prettylike, so precalculation of parens groups would like make the whole system a bit too complicated.p  pSo, questionp  pEven asking this question seems silly, but is there a way to implement a grammar in ANTLR that can parse and interpret complicated and deeply nested expressions without exploding the call stackp  pThe grammarp  precodegrammar doubleCalc  options      language  Java     output  AST   k2    Calculation function. prog returns [double value]        eaddsub EOF value  e.value       addsub returns [double value]        emuldiv value  e.value            PLUS emuldiv value  e.value            MINUS emuldiv value  e.value                muldiv returns [double value]        epower value  e.value             MUL epower value  e.value            DIV epower value  e.value                 power returns [double value]        e  negate value  e.value             POW fpower value  java.lang.Math.powvalue, f.value                    negate returns [double value]           MINUS neg  atom value  neg.value            neg  atom value  neg.value                atom returns [double value]        LOG10  eaddsub  value  java.lang.Math.log10e.value         LOG8  eaddsub  value  java.lang.Math.log10e.valuejava.lang.Math.log108.0         LOG2  eaddsub  value  java.lang.Math.log10e.valuejava.lang.Math.log102.0         LN  eaddsub  value  java.lang.Math.loge.value         ASIN  eaddsub  value  Math.asinMath.PIe.valueMath.PI  1com.brogramming.HoloCalc.Trig.asine.value         ACOS  eaddsub  value  Math.acosMath.PIe.valueMath.PI  1        ATAN  eaddsub  value  Math.atanMath.PIe.valueMath.PI  1        SIN  eaddsub  value  Math.sinMath.PIe.valueMath.PI  1         COS  eaddsub  value  Math.cosMath.PIe.valueMath.PI  1         TAN  eaddsub  value  Math.tanMath.PIe.valueMath.PI  1        ASIND  eaddsub  value  Math.asinMath.PIe.value180f  1com.brogramming.HoloCalc.Trig.asine.value         ACOSD  eaddsub  value  Math.acosMath.PIe.value180f  1        ATAND  eaddsub  value  Math.atanMath.PIe.value180f  1        SIND  eaddsub  value  Math.sinMath.PIe.value180f  1         COSD  eaddsub  value  Math.cosMath.PIe.value180f  1         TAND  eaddsub  value  Math.tanMath.PIe.value180f  1        SQRT  eaddsub  value  double java.lang.Math.powe.value, 0.5         CBRT  eaddsub  value  double java.lang.Math.powe.value, 1.03.0         ABS  eaddsub  value  double java.lang.Math.abse.value      Numbers        n  number value  n.value         eaddsub  value  e.value       number returns [double value]        PI value  java.lang.Math.PI        EXP value  java.lang.Math.E        INT value  double Double.parseDoubleINT.text.replaceAll,,         DOUBLE value  Double.parseDoubleDOUBLE.text.replaceAll,,        LN      ln LOG10      log10 LOG8       log8 LOG2       log2 SIN    sin COS    cos TAN    tan ASIN       asin ACOS       acos ATAN       atan SINH       sinh COSH       cosh TANH       tanh ASINH      asinh ACOSH      acosh ATANH      atanh SIND       sind COSD       cosd TAND       tand ASIND      asind ACOSD      acosd ATAND      atand SINHD      sinhd COSHD      coshd TANHD      tanhd ASINHD     asinhd ACOSHD     acoshd ATANHD     atanhd PI     pi IM     i EXP    e ABS    abs FACT       fact SQRE       sqre CUBE       cube SQRT       sqrt CBRT       cbrt POW   PLUS   MINUS   MUL   DIV   BANG        DOUBLE 0..9  , .0..9  INT    0..9  ,  NEWLINEr n  PERCENT         EOF    ltEOFgt channelHIDDEN codepre

Negative 5948 pI have been working to eliminate memory leaks in our mono touch and learned a lot in last couple of days e.g. that it is almost always some event that needs to be unhook before garbage collecting is succeeded p  pBut now I have been playing around with the profiller tool and I can see that most of the memory is used by strings or it seems, please see the following screendump img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6RV4s.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comznfkk.png altenter image description herep  pBut as you can see some memory is also used by mono. I have been working our viewmodels and views and most of these are garbage collected correct. If I look into the strings they sometimes are referenced by  and I have no clue what to do with this info.  Do you guys have any suggestion if I can reduce the amount of memory used by strings  I have tried to find any tutorial or similar that might enlight what these numbers means, but with no luck. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 5948 pIm part of a team reviving a dormant open source project. One of the first things I did was fix the software to build with Visual C on Windows. The plan is to distribute the MSVC version in the upcoming release.p  pThe current DLL is built with the codestdcallcode calling convention, for reasons I cant explain. No big deal, except it was also built with MinGW and MinGW and Visual C disagree about what codestdcallcode means. See a hrefhttpwyw.dcweb.cnstdcall.htm relnofollowherea for details, but basically MinGW mangles the name like codeFunctionncode and MSVC mangles it like codeFunctionncode. Its a good reason not to use codestdcallcode in your DLLs...p  pThe switch to codestdcallcode was important enough to the previous maintainers that they bumped a major version number because it broke ABI compatibility when they switched to it and Im reluctant to bump it again to switch back to codecdeclcode.p  pBasically, I need to convince MSVC to decorate the symbols in the DLL like MinGW does, either with some sort of alias, or just changing the name. I dont care which, as the other software in the suite can be easily rebuilt to call the DLL however is needed  its existing software Im worried about.p  pI suspect I need a .DEF file for this, but Im reluctant to make one by hand. Theres dozens of exported functions.p  pSo heres the question  is there any automated or mostlyautomated way to do thisp

Negative 5948 pI have a script that is running two commands.  The first command is writing data to a temp file.

I.e. awk is getting an EOF from tmpdata.txt before command1 has finished writing to it.p  pIve also tried wrapping some checks around getline, likep  precodewhile getline templine lt tmpdata.txt lt 0      systemsleep 1  let command1 write more to the temp file   Keep processing now that we have read the next line codepre  pBut I think once it hits an EOF in the temp file, it stops trying to read from it.  Or something like that.p  pThe overall script works as long as command1 writes to the temp file faster than awk tries to read from it.  If I put a sleep 10 command between the two commands, then the temp file builds enough buffer and the script produces the output I need.  But I may be parsing files much larger than what Ive tested on, or the commands might run at different speeds on different systems, etc, so Id like a safety mechanism to wait for the file until data has been written to it.p  pAny ideas how I can do thisp

Any ideasp  pstrongEDITstrong       Thanks for the early replies After reading the comments, I found that the problem lies not with my class, but with another function I was calling emwith the Array class as an argumentem . If I remove the call to this function, and added the delete call in the class, no memory leaks occur. Here is my function p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void printContentsArrayltTgt ar forunsigned int i0 iltar.size i     coutltltContent at i in array   ltlt ar.ati ltlt endl   codepre  pAfter reading the Rule of Threethanks to chris and the answer posted by Grizzly, I have now understood why the delete[] was invalid. Because I had not overloaded the copy constructor, shallow copying occured, due to which, my array pointer got emassignedem to the pointer in ar, and when ar when out of scope, the delete[] was called, thereby making my delete in the main function eminvalidem . Hence, I was getting the exception. If I removed the delete, then the array would obviously remain allocated and result in a memory leak.p  pThanks for the help, I have voted Grizzlys answer as correct.p

Negative 5948 pcurrently Im working on image retrieval with Python. The keypoints and descriptors extracted from an image in this example are represented as codenumpy.arraycodes.

Negative 5948 pIm having issues with a parallax site I am building using Skrollr. p  pIve built a site that has the same effect as a hrefhttpswww.spotify.comuk relnofollowhttpswww.spotify.comuka. The effect being large full width background images that move slower than the natural browser scroll, and have text and other images moving on top of them. p  pWhen viewed on a desktop browser the site functions fine and performs perfectly. The problem Im having is when testing on an iPad iOS 6.1.3 and you release your finger from the screen and Skrollrs intertia animation takes over, the large background images and other content on the screen start to jitter and jump on the screen. This does not happen when you still have your finger touching the screen and scroll, only when you let go and the easing takes over.p  pA couple of things Ive tried arep  ul liSetting codewebkitbackfacevisibilityhiddencode on all of the background images, and skrollrbody div.li liAnimate elements using codewebkit transition translate3dcodeli ul  pIf anyone could shed any light on why Im getting this page flickering issue that would be great. p

Negative 5948 pI have a mobile app with a comment system, backed by App Engine.  When user A replies to user Bs comment, user B gets a notification.  Everything works over HTTP.p  pRight now I have the client device polling App Engine every minute for updates.  It works but on average, theres a 30second delay before the notification appears.p  pI would like to close this gap by having App Engine send a packet to user Bs device immediately after user A posts the reply.  I can make this happen by moving the codewait60code command from the client to the server  the client will run a tight loop, making another request as soon as it gets a response App Engine sits on every request for 60 seconds before responding.p  pBut if the user gets a notification, App Engine responds before the 60 seconds are up.  Essentially, user As request handler wakes up user Bs sleeping request handler and causes it to return nonnull data.p  pIs there a name for this technique as applied to HTTP  Can it be coded efficiently  If so, how can I implement the waitnotify codep

Negative 5948 pEDIT Thank to Joes advice, I will make my question more specific. Actually I need to code a function in Stata which takes variables A,B,C,D,... as inputs and a variable Y as output which can be evaluated with usual Stata functionscommands like generate dummy2myfunX if ... p  pThe function itself contains numerical calculations. A pseudo Stata code will look likep  precodemyfunX  gen Y0.5X if X1  replace Y31X if X2  replace YX2 if X3  .... a long list returnY  codepre  pNotice that X can be a huge set of different Stata variables and the numerical calculations are rather long inside the function. Thats why I would like to use a function. I guess that the native program command in Stata is not suitable for this type of problem because it cannot take variables as inputoutput. p

Negative 5948 pScenario is as follow  We have a Asp.Net MVC 4 App having a private messaging system that hosts a signalR hub used to notify users when new message are available for them.  Everything works fine, the Web App register connectionId along with their username and the signal is sent to the hub from the DataLayer via a notificationAdapter class.p  pThe problem came when we had to create a separate service leveraging Quartz.Net that also send private messages when tasks are finished. We want the Quartz service to be able to contact the Hub but we cant cause it is in a separate process. I dont want to use the signalR .net client because I dont need a permanent connection between the Quartz based service and my Web App. I think of creating an endpoint in my WebSite to expose Hubs server method to the service or to use ScaleOut for that but I feel like I miss something and though I would ask the community.p

Negative 5948 pSince a while I have been trying to make this work but in spite of my thorough Internet searches the answer keeps eluding me. I made a userForm in VBA Excel with some textboxes en checkboxes. These values are sent to a sheet in the excel file. The checkboxes represent categories so multiple choices can be selected. The value is translated to true  x and false   before it is send to the sheet.p  precodeIf userForm.checkbox1.Value  True Then     ws.Rows.Cellsrow, 9.Value  X Else     ws.Rows.Cellsrow, 9.Value   End If codepre  pThe information put in the sheet can be retrieved and edited by using almost the same userForm. This form has a row selection box with which the desired row can be summoned and the corresponding data populates the userform.

When sending the information back to the sheet, these values are not seen. So on the sheet these values disappear. One option is to recheck all the boxes again. This is not what I desire since a lot of people are going to use this form and that would be time consuming and impractical. Is there a way to activateenable the checkboxesp

The suggested workaround is to create a new configuration in xcode with sandboxing disabled and running the tests with that configuration. p  pThis works, of course, but it seems like a poor workaround since it will be running the tests in a different environment than the real application normally would and potentially missing on a whole category of bugs resulting from different permissions, directories etc.p  pI can hardly believe that Apple intended developers to disable sandboxing for testing, seems very short sighted.

Negative 5948 pI have written a script describing a dynamic biological process in matlab the input to which is a year of daily temperature values.The model runs for a year on this daily timestep carrying out different calculations required for the process. p  pI have thirty years of temperature data matrix of size 36530 and I intend to write a for loop at the start of the script in order to use each year of daily data consecutively. I have about 5 variables that are the output from the script, which I intend to output to a txtcsv file at each iteration. My problem is that there are approximately 80 variables within the model and I would like to zero them all at each iteration of the outermost loop the temperature input. I would like to do this in an efficient manner rather than having to individually zero all the variables. Does anyone know how to do thisp  pI have been looking at using the who function to list all the variables and Im thinking that it could be used somehow to zero  everything. I have tried letting x  who which seems to produce a list of all the variables in inverted commas. But obviously trying to let x  0 after that just redefines x. I was also thinking of just using clear all but I think this would really slow the model down as it would be starting from scratch redefining all the variable at each loop Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 5948 pI have a RESTEasy client endpoint which connects to a RESTbased database server which gives JSON responses. The data model of the other end POJOs annotated with JSON annotations are available for use.p  pI would like to properly unit test the methods that are communicating with requestsresponses. Test code written with the help of JUnit and Mockito.p  pThe picture gets more complicated in case of a method that sends a request, needs to parse the JSON result, should extract the new ID of the created entity and reuse this ID to make another request to replace the automatically generated device name into a more readable and friendlier name. I was thinking of maybe this method should be broken apart to two methods, but I cant see any clean and good solution because this method will be used as an access point from other components in the system, therefore one method should accomplish one thing.p  pEnough of talking, lets see the code itselfp  precodepublic void createDevicefinal Device device      final RequestDescriptor requestDescriptor  new DeviceCreateRequestDescriptordevice     final RequestCreator requestCreator  new RequestCreatorrequestDescriptor, HttpMethod.POST, uriBuilder     final ClientRequest request  requestCreator.create     final ClientResponse response  executor.executerequest     final String responseString  String response.getEntityString.class      JSON unmarshall logic will be here     I should get the device ID from the response, doable with e.g. Jackson     String deviceId        changeDeviceNamedevice, deviceId      private void changeDeviceNamefinal Device device, final String deviceId throws Exception      final UriBuilderWrapper uriBuilder  new UriBuilderWrapperdatabaseConfig,             m2mInterfaceContainer.getM2MProvisioningInterface     final RequestDescriptor requestDescriptor  new DeviceNameChangeRequestDescriptordevice, deviceId     final RequestCreator requestCreator  new RequestCreatorrequestDescriptor, HttpMethod.POST, uriBuilder     final ClientRequest request  requestCreator.create     executor.executerequest  codepre  pMy test code looks like  p  precodeTest public void testCreateDeviceSendsTwoRequests throws Exception      clientExecutorWrapper  mockClientExecutorWrapper.class      m2mDeviceManager  new M2MDeviceManager     device  new Device123456666, 6789066666     m2mDeviceManager.createDevicedevice      final ArgumentCaptorltClientRequestgt requestCaptor  ArgumentCaptor.forClassClientRequest.class     verifyclientExecutorWrapper, times2.executerequestCaptor.capture      final ListltClientRequestgt capturedRequests  requestCaptor.getAllValues      final MapltString, Stringgt expectedFormParametersForCreateDeviceRequest  createExpectedFormParametersForFirstRequest     final MapltString, Stringgt expectedFormParametersForChangeNameRequest  createExpectedFormParametersForSecondRequest      final String expectedUrlCreateDeviceRequest  dummyurl1     final String expectedUrlForChangeNameRequest  dummyurl2     RequestChecker.checkRequestcapturedRequests.get0, expectedFormParametersForCreateDeviceRequest,             expectedUrlCreateDeviceRequest     RequestChecker.checkRequestcapturedRequests.get1, expectedFormParametersForChangeNameRequest,             expectedUrlForChangeNameRequest  codepre  pMy helper methods for the test case looks like p  precodeprivate MapltString, Stringgt createExpectedFormParametersForFirstRequest      final MapltString, Stringgt expectedFormParameters  new HashMapltString, Stringgt     expectedFormParameters.putsomeparam,somevalue      ... other form parameters     return expectedFormParameters   private MapltString, Stringgt createExpectedFormParametersForSecondRequest      final MapltString, Stringgt expectedFormParameters  new HashMapltString, Stringgt     expectedFormParameters.putsomeparam2,somevalue2      ... other form parameters     return expectedFormParameters  codepre  pThe codeRequestCheckercode helper class for the test looks like p  precodeclass RequestChecker   public static void checkRequestfinal ClientRequest request, final MapltString, Stringgt expectedFormParameters,         final String expectedUrl throws Exception      final MultivaluedMapltString, Stringgt formParameters  request.getFormParameters     final MultivaluedMapltString, Stringgt queryParameters  request.getQueryParameters      assertEqualsexpectedUrl, request.getUri      assertTruequeryParameters.size  0     checkFormParametersexpectedFormParameters, formParameters     private static void checkFormParametersfinal MapltString, Stringgt expectedFormParameters,         final MultivaluedMapltString, Stringgt formParameters      final SetltEntryltString, Stringgtgt expectedParameters  expectedFormParameters.entrySet     for final EntryltString, Stringgt expectedParameter  expectedParameters          final String expectedParameterName  expectedParameter.getKey         final String expectedParameterValue  expectedParameter.getValue         final ListltStringgt actualFormParameters  formParameters.getexpectedParameterName         checkFormParameteractualFormParameters, expectedParameterValue         private static void checkFormParameterfinal ListltStringgt actualFormParameters, final String expected      assertNotNullactualFormParameters     assertTrueactualFormParameters.size  1     assertEqualsexpected, actualFormParameters.get0    codepre  pSo basically I would like to build up my unit test for this something like p  pMock the codeexecutorcode somehow to correctly generate JSON results based on the requests. Correct me if Im wrong but I could marshal back the JSON result if I build up the mocked object hierarchy. My problem here is that I need to create the hierarchy for every single request, but I guess I cannot do anything fancier here. I should assert that the codechangeDeviceNamecode method invoked with the expected device ID.p  pQuestions p  ol lipIs it okay to test the unmarshal logic independently from this to ensure all other methods do the unmarshalling as expected or are there any better way of doing thispli lipAre there any applicable refactor patterns I can use to make this a bit cleaner These two methods are too tighly coupled. pli lipAre there any cleaner approach instead of this testcase. I hope I can get something better, I dont like these argument captors and generally too much code is needed to simply describe this case and there will be many types of the requests.pli ol

Negative 5948 pI am using codeIIViewDeckControllercode and facing a very weird problem as followsp  pMy codeViewControllercodewhich is an codeIIViewDeckControllercode is in landscape mode and then I present a new view controller modally on top of it. Now the modal view controller does not support landscape mode and thus is presented only in portrait mode.br As of now, everything went fine.  p  pBut as soon as I try to dismiss this modally presented controller, codeIIViewDeckControllerscode views frame becomes 320,568 I think this codeIIViewDeckControllercode has rotated to portrait mode but I am not sure for that. So I checked codeself.interfaceOrientationcode which showed 4i.e. codeUIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeftcode which should be the actual case.p  pBut these two things are confusing me as the frame is indicating the portrait mode and property shows something different. Now because of this frame changing without changing the codeinterfaceOrientationcode is result into wrong calculation of objects frames in the view.p

Negative 5948 pI am running Orchard CMS 1.7.2. I created a custom module called codeBYUtv.Shapescode as a place to store reusable shape methods.  I have a class called codeRelatedToShow  IDependencycode in this module. The method of interest in this class is called codeRelatedEpisodescode.  The purpose of this shape method is to retrieve Episodes data, via a query created in the admin ui, for Episodes related to a specific Show.  In the manager the Episode content type definition has a Content Picker Field that allows a content manager to pick a Show that the Episode is part of or related to.  The query that I created is working correctly and returning the correct data.  With that explanation here is my shape method.p  precode[Shape] public IHtmlString RelatedEpisodesdynamic Shape, dynamic Display, int PageSize, string PagerSuffix         Retrieves the QueryPart by name for the query called Related Episodes Year.      Related Episodes Year retrieves Episodes that are related to a specific show with an optional year filter.     QueryPart episodesQuery  GetQueryPartByNameRelated Episodes Year      dynamic pager  CreatePagerShape, projectionManager.GetCountepisodesQuery.Id, PageSize, PagerSuffix      int startIndex  pager.Pager.GetStartIndex     int pageSize  pager.Pager.PageSize      IEnumerableltContentItemgt contentItems  new ListltContentItemgt     ifepisodesQuery  null              contentItems  projectionManager.GetContentItemsepisodesQuery.Id, startIndex, pageSize            Retrieves the QueryPart by name for the query called Related Episodes.      Related Episodes retrieves Episodes that are related to a specific show.     QueryPart newestEpisodeQuery  GetQueryPartByNameRelated Episodes      ContentItem newestEpisode  null     if newestEpisodeQuery  null              newestEpisode  projectionManager.GetContentItemsnewestEpisodeQuery.Id, 0, 1.FirstOrDefault            Retrieves a list of distinct years that the episodes premiered in.

It also works in production but seemingly randomly crashes the page it is used on in production.  If I comment the code that runs this shape method in production than the rest of the page runs as desired. The only difference that I am aware of between production and local is possibly the HostCompontents.config file and the traffic volume.  In production I turn off several properties because I understand it will help performance.p  pHere are the logs from the production server.p  precodeException information  Exception type AssertionFailure  Exception message collection was processed twice by flush at NHibernate.Engine.Collections.PrepareCollectionForUpdateIPersistentCollection collection, CollectionEntry entry, EntityMode entityMode, ISessionFactoryImplementor factory in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEngineCollections.csline 164 at NHibernate.Event.Default.AbstractFlushingEventListener.FlushCollectionsIEventSource session in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEventDefaultAbstractFlushingEventListener.csline 92 at NHibernate.Event.Default.AbstractFlushingEventListener.FlushEverythingToExecutionsFlushEvent event in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEventDefaultAbstractFlushingEventListener.csline 61 at NHibernate.Event.Default.DefaultAutoFlushEventListener.OnAutoFlushAutoFlushEvent event in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEventDefaultDefaultAutoFlushEventListener.csline 32 at NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.AutoFlushIfRequiredISet1 querySpaces in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplSessionImpl.csline 1180 at NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.ListString query, QueryParameters queryParameters, IList results in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplSessionImpl.csline 616 at NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.ListString query, QueryParameters parameters in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplSessionImpl.csline 593 at NHibernate.Impl.QueryImpl.List in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplQueryImpl.csline 64 at NHibernate.Impl.AbstractQueryImpl.UniqueResult in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplAbstractQueryImpl.csline 960 at Orchard.ContentManagement.DefaultHqlQuery.Count in cSourceBYUBbyuradio2orchardsrcOrchardContentManagementDefaultHqlQuery.csline 212 at Orchard.Projections.Services.ProjectionManager.ltGetCountgtb14IHqlQuery contentQuery at System.Linq.Enumerable.WhereSelectEnumerableIterator2.MoveNext at System.Linq.Enumerable.SumIEnumerable1 source at Orchard.Projections.Services.ProjectionManager.GetCountInt32 queryId at BYUtv.Shapes.Drivers.RelatedToShow.RelatedEpisodesObject Shape, Object Display, Nullable1 PageSize, String PagerSuffix codepre  pandp  precodeStack trace    at NHibernate.Engine.Collections.PrepareCollectionForUpdateIPersistentCollection collection, CollectionEntry entry, EntityMode entityMode, ISessionFactoryImplementor factory in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEngineCollections.csline 164 at NHibernate.Event.Default.AbstractFlushingEventListener.FlushCollectionsIEventSource session in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEventDefaultAbstractFlushingEventListener.csline 92 at NHibernate.Event.Default.AbstractFlushingEventListener.FlushEverythingToExecutionsFlushEvent event in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEventDefaultAbstractFlushingEventListener.csline 61 at NHibernate.Event.Default.DefaultAutoFlushEventListener.OnAutoFlushAutoFlushEvent event in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateEventDefaultDefaultAutoFlushEventListener.csline 32 at NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.AutoFlushIfRequiredISet1 querySpaces in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplSessionImpl.csline 1180 at NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.ListString query, QueryParameters queryParameters, IList results in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplSessionImpl.csline 616 at NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.ListString query, QueryParameters parameters in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplSessionImpl.csline 593 at NHibernate.Impl.QueryImpl.List in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplQueryImpl.csline 64 at NHibernate.Impl.AbstractQueryImpl.UniqueResult in cUserssebrosDocumentsMy ProjectsnhibernatecoresrcNHibernateImplAbstractQueryImpl.csline 960 at Orchard.ContentManagement.DefaultHqlQuery.Count in cSourceBYUBbyuradio2orchardsrcOrchardContentManagementDefaultHqlQuery.csline 212 at Orchard.Projections.Services.ProjectionManager.ltGetCountgtb14IHqlQuery contentQuery at System.Linq.Enumerable.WhereSelectEnumerableIterator2.MoveNext at System.Linq.Enumerable.SumIEnumerable1 source at Orchard.Projections.Services.ProjectionManager.GetCountInt32 queryId at BYUtv.Shapes.Drivers.RelatedToShow.RelatedEpisodesObject Shape, Object Display, Nullable1 PageSize, String PagerSuffix codepre  pThe error seems to always relate to codecollection was processed twice by flushcode.

Negative 5948 pIve recently implemented a hrefhttpsgithub.comlaurent22gosqlkv relnofollowa packagea that uses the codedatabasesqlcode package. By limiting the SQL to very simple selectupdateinsert statements I assumed the package would work with all the DBMS supported by codedatabasesqlcode.p  pHowever, it turns out that some databases use codecode as placeholder value while others use code1code, code2code, etc., which means the prepared statements will work with some DBMS but not with others.p  pSo Im wondering is there any technique to make this work in a generic way with all the supported drivers Or is it necessary to have DBMSspecific code everywhere which I think would make the abstraction provided by codedatabasesqlcode a bit pointless. I guess using nonprepared statements is not an option either since different DBMS have different ways to escape parameters.p  pAny suggestionp

So the link id cant be used as the selector. p  pAlso, theres another option for each item thats also irreversible, and that I want the user to confirm, but with a different message. NB the option is idempotent, though. At the moment this is handled by having a template macro that produces the html, and the message is specified as an argument to the template macro. So ideally thered be a way to specify the message when generating the html for the link.p

Negative 5948 pI am having an knockout issue with software that I work on but did not build. The page in question performs autosaves when almost any field is edited. The page displays multiple test questions, each of which has responses answers associated. The autosave is implemented with a dirty flag that compares the current state of the object to the initial state. p  pThe symptoms I am seeing is that when visiting the page the first time and adding a new question causes 1 api call to be made for the 1 new question which is correct. If I navigate to another page and come back to the same test or a different one, all api calls are duplicated. If I repeat the same thing again, 3 calls exactly the same are made. My theory is that something in the VMobservable is not getting properly unset when leaving the page. I have debugged this a lot and I dont think there are multiple different actions triggering the save, but 1 action causing the triggering of the computed functions which triggers the autosave for every time that any test has been opened. Refreshing the browser causes this invisible counter to reset. p  pThere are two computed functions p  precodeself.dirtyQuestions  ko.computedfunction    return ko.utils.arrayFilterself.current.assessmentItems, functionquestion      return question.dirtyFlag.isDirty    , self.extend throttle 250   self.triggerDirtyQuestionSave  ko.computedfunction    if CONFIG.editing.autoSave      return      if self.dirtyQuestions.length gt 0      self.saveQuestionsself.dirtyQuestions, true    , self codepre  pthat seem to depend solely on an observable arrayp  precode  assessmentItems ko.observableArray[], codepre  pthat is an object with many obsdervables associated with it. If any of these are modified or a new item is pushed, an autosave is triggered in the two computeds above. While debugging, I see these both being triggered multiple times after leaving and revisiting the pages, but all my breakpoints on modifications of the elements in the assessmentItems observable will only fire once. p  pMy specific question is, how can I determine if something about the pageVMobservablearray is persisting after leaving the page that would cause an accumulation when leaving and returning to the page that might explain these duplicate triggers The page is somewhat of a mess but also fairly complicated so I am trying to avoid having to rewrite it or strip out all of the autosave features. p  pupdate p  pRoute table entryp  precode        create        enter [         checkForUnsavedChanges,         function             self.closeOverlay       ],       to function          assessmentAuthoringVM  new AssessmentAuthoringVMself       ,       exit function          if assessmentAuthoringVM            assessmentAuthoringVM.destroy                     , codepre

Negative 5948 pIve been given an openended project spec for a school project where I need to create both a socket library, and two unique threaded applications to test its use in C. p  pRight now were in the early stages of learning about sockets, so ideally I just want to generate some ideas for unique and moderately easy applications I could make to demonstrate a custom socket library in a Microsoft environment. Ive already done quite a bit of back reading on sockets and networking theory.p  pThe project specs are as followsp  pCreate a socket library for Win3264. The library should implement the following featuresp  ul liHide and manage the socket handleli liFill in as many of function parameters as possibleli liAutomatic cleanupli liAutomatic WSAStarupCleanupli ul  pApplication Requirementsp  ul liClientli liServerli liApps are threaded li ul  pAt this stage I dont know what the library is going to look like or how it will interact with the apps.p

Negative 5948 pWe are currently in the process of developing our own ecommerce solution, as part of our research we have been examining the ZenCart Database Schema and found that data is quite frequently duplicated between various tables where it would seem that perhaps a Foreign Key would have been sufficient to link the two or more tables in question, for examplep  pGiven that there is table Products that has the following columnsp  pPRODUCTIDbrPRODUCTNAMEbrPRODUCTPRICEbrPRODUCTSKUp  pThen if there is a SalesItem Table Then of course a product and all its constituent columnsmay be referenced by simply doing something likep  pSALESITEMIDbrProductsPRODUCTID  This is the foreign key that relates a specific product to a sale item.brSALETIMEbrRESTOFSALESPECIFICDATA......p  pHowever instead it seems that the Sales table COPIES many of the field values defined in the Products table so it infact looks as followsp  pSALESITEMIDbrPRODUCTIDbrPRODUCTNAMEbrPRODUCTPRICEbrPRODUCTSKUbrSALETIMEp  pMy question is which approach would generally be considered best practice when attempting to build a scalable efficient solution. Using foreign keys means data is not duplicated but the caveat is that database or applicationlevel JOINS would be needed in order to query the entire dataset. However than being said, for some reason the foreign key approach seems cleaner and more correct somehow. p

Below the superficial inguinal ring they unite to form three or four veins, which pass along the inguinal canal, and, entering the abdomen through the deep inguinal ring, coalesce to form two veins. These again unite to form a single vein, the testicular vein, which opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, at an acute angle, and on the left side into the left renal vein, at a right angle.The pampiniform plexus forms the chief mass of the cord.ampltbr ampgt   ampltbr ampgt   ampampnbspampltdivampgt  ampltdivampgt   In addition to its function in venous return from the testes, the pampiniform plexus also plays a role in the temperature regulation of the testes.

Negative 5948 pI have a bunch of constraints, each consisting of two symbols and a comparison operator codeltcode, codeltcode, codecode, codecode, codegtcode, or codegtcode. So, for examplep  precodeA lt B C gt B A  C C  D D gt E codepre  pI want to be able to do three thingsp  ol liFirst, I want to check if there are any inconsistencies. So, for example, if I have codeA gt Bcode, codeB gt Ccode, and codeA  Ccode, theres an inconsistency, as codeAcode must be both equal to codeCcode and greater than it.li liI want to be able to query any two symbols, and get back the feasible relative orderings between them. So for example codequeryA, Ccode should return codeltcode a set consisting of a single element less than, and codequeryB, Ecode should return codelt, , gtcode.li liI want to be able to add a constraint this could also add an additional symbols, for example adding codeF  Gcode to the above example.li ol  pQueries are more common than adding constraints.p  pIve already come up with a method that works if you do not have any codecode constraintsp  ol liTranslate every constraint into ones that only uses codeltcode or codeltcode So codeX  Ycode turns into codeX lt Ycode and codeY lt Xcode, codeX gt Ycode turns into codeY lt Xcode, etc..li liBuild a directed graph with the symbols, using the constraints as edges.li liFor all cycles in the graph, if the cycle includes at least one codeltcode edge, there is a contradiction.li ol  pTo codequeryX, Ycodep  ol liFind any path between codeXcode and codeYcode. ul liIf there is no such path, the result of this part is codelt, , gtcode.li liIf the path contains at least one codeltcode, the result of this part is codeltcode.li liOtherwise, the result of this part is codelt, code.li ulli liFind any path between codeYcode and codeXcode ul liIf there is no such path, the result of this part is codelt, , gtcode.li liIf the path contains at least one codeltcode, the result of this part is codegtcode.li liOtherwise, the result of this part is code, gtcode.li ulli liThe result is the union of the above two results.li ol  pObviously, I can cache the queries, at least until I add another constraintp  pI can extend this to include codecode, but then it becomes exponentially slower w.r.t. the number of constraints that use codecode. Keep a set of graphs instead of one. Every time you add a constraint with codecode, for each graph in the set replace it with two copies, one where the constraint to be added is codeltcode, one where it is codegtcode. Any time one produces a contradiction, discard it. If the set of graphs is empty, there is a contradiction. On a query, check all graphs, unioning the answers together.p  pSo, is there a more efficient way to solve this problem Or is it going to be exponentialtime worst case regardlessp  pI am aware that I could use a SAT solver for this, but it seems a mite overkill, to put it mildly, especially as I cannot see it ever exceeding 100 constraints, with 10 being more typical.p  pFor those interested in what this came out of, I am working on a toy programming language and became interested in the idea of making custom infix operators, where priority is decided by relation to existing operators instead of a straight numerical value which has issues when you want to add a new operator with higher priority than codeAcode but lower than codeBcode, but there is no gap between the two. codecode is not strictly required for that problem, but I became interested in how one would include it.p

Negative 5948 pI cannot seem to work this one out. Here is my set upp  pI have a function called coderequestDataWithCompletionsomeBlockblockcode. I call it when the class is initialised. The function requests certain motion data. I want to do this periodically, therefore, the first time I call this function, I specify some completion code which sets up a timer that recalls this function periodically. The timer calls it via another function coderequestDataWithoutCompletioncode which simply calls the coderequestDataWithCompletioncode but with an empty block so I dont keep creating timersp  precode void requestDataWithCompletionsomeBlockblock   BREAK POINT 1         [self.motionManager queryActivityStartingFromDatestart toDate[NSDate date] toQueueself.queue withHandlerNSArray activities, NSError error    BREAK POINT 2              do some processing              block         ]      codepre  pThe block simply creates a timer on the main queue, which periodically recalls this function, but with no completion since I dont want to keep creating more timers. p  precodeblock         dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,              self.timer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeIntervaltimerInterval  targetself selectorselectorrequestDataWithoutCompletion userInfonil repeatsYES]                     void requestDataWithoutCompletion  [self requestDataWithCompletion]  codepre  pThe amazing thing is that despite this set up, my app is creating timer after timer I cant understand why. p  pI have placed break points in coderequestDataWithCompletioncode method. One is outside the block submitted to codeNSOperationQueuecode to get activity data BREAKPOINT 1 and one is inside the block submitted to codeNSOperationQueue.code BREAKPOINT 2. Basically it shows that each time the method is called by the timer, BREAKPOINT 1 has an empty completion block as it should be but then strangely BREAKPOINT 2 has the completion block I submitted when I first called the function when initialising the class. Therefore, it continues to create a new timer each time the function is called by the timer. Over time, this means a massive number of timers and then the app crashesp  pI have a feeling this is something to do with NSOperationQueue, but I really dont know what it could be. p

Negative 5948 pWe have an SQL Server Mirroring established between a database on two SQL Server 2012 Standard instances on two different servers. The witness is on a third server running the express edition. The IP addresses not hostnames of primary, mirror and witness servers are mentioned in the mirroring configurations while creating the mirror using SSMS. Now problem is that a change in the IP address of the mirror is required. There is a proper reasoning behind that and it cant be avoided. The system is live and outage should be avoided to the max. The new IP is accessible from both primary and witness. When we take the mirror server out, the mirroring is affected, but as soon the server is back with the same old IP, mirroring resumes appropriately. However, how to change the endpoints IP address without having the need to remove and then recreate the mirror. Is it possible or there is NO way this can be achieved without removerecreatep  pIf there is an absolute need here to do this removerecreate, how to ensure that we dont copy over the complete database and its logs and redo the process from scratch. If all clients access to the primary is blocked during the time to ensure that no transaction is taking place, would this sufficep  pA solution without removerecreate would be the preferred one.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5948 pI have the following problemp  pIve just rebuilt the Linux kernel was 3.13.024, now 3.15.5 of my Ubuntu to add some modules which are responsible for providing some virtual features vfio in particular. The problem is that when Im trying to load VFIO module using sudo modprobe vfio command the system responds that it could not open moddep file libmodules3.15.5modules.dep.bin. This answer makes sense because there is no such the path in the system. In the libmodules directory there is only one directory 3.13.024generic. I tried to find modules.dep.bin file using find. It found it in only one directory 3.13.024generic. p  pSo I have no clue how to get over this problem. Could someone please give me a hint what went wrongp

Right now the validation seems to be checking if the two topicsource fields have values independent of whether or not the parents name field has a value, AND the topicsource fields only register as invalid if a field has been entered and then erased. p  pHow do I make sure the checkForExistence function is only called when topicName has a non empty string value Second, how do I make sure blank fields are invalid without having to modify them somehowp

Negative 5948 pMy browser connects to a restify application through io.socket. When connection is estabilished, the restify application initiates a long polling to a node.js application with http.request. Im experiencing some strange behaviour in the log file. At some point the log file of the restify application seems to go in some kind of infinite loop. It is not infinite as it writes the same thing in the log about a couple of hundreded times. But the behaviour makes me think somewhere there is a bug.p  pThe first thing that is written in the log is insidep  precodesocket.ondisconnect, function codepre  pThe second thing that is written to the log is the reference to the specific users socket somewhere there is a reference to the client browsers socket. So the line isp  precodesck.ondisconnect, function codepre  pIn the event above I have a line that forces the http.request object the longpolling, the request that had been estabilished between the restify app and the other node.js app to be destroyed. So the line isp  precodenodeclient.destroy codepre  pFrom now on, for about 200 times or something like that, the step 2 which is the event sck.ondisconnect, function is repeated continuosly. All this takes some milliseconds. The timestamp seems to be the same all the time.p  pThen at the end the application goes in the p  precodenodeclient.onerror, function e  codepre  pIn that function happens another couple of things, but it does not seems relevant as the issue happens before just in case I force disconnect to skc and run destroy on the client again.p  pWhats wrong I think could be the line     nodeclient.destroyp  pim not really sure why I put this, I think it was a way to clean up. I guess it could be difficult to understand the issue. But please feel free to ask if you need more details.p

Negative 5948 pI am trying to make an arcade game for my school project. The basic idea is to do all the math and drawing in other thread than the main, and to use the main thread only for input routines. Drawing is done by a procedure saved in an external unit, and is done by creating a bitmap, then drawing parts of the environment on the bitmap and finally dawing the bitmap on the main forms canvas. When I finished the drawing procedure, I tried to run it from the main thread, and managed to make everythink work as expected except for the fact that the whole application window was frozen, but since the main thread was working without stopping, sommething like that was expected. Then i tried to put the procedure in other thread, and it stopped working it didnt draw a single thing despite debug routines reporting that the procedure was repeatedly executed. After a few added and then deleted debug routnes, it started to work for no apparent reason, but not reliably. in about 80 of cases it runs smoothly, but in the rest it stops after ten to thirty frames, sometimes even not draving some of the environment parts in the last frame where it gets stuck.p  pThe important part of the main form unit looks like thisp  precodeprocedure TForm1.Button1ClickSender TObject  begin runningnot running if running then AppTheard.Createfalse end  Procedure AppTheard.execute  begin  form1.Button1.Captionrunning  while running do begin view.nextframe end  form1.Button1.Captionno longer running  end codepre  pand the nextframe procedure in the other unit looks like thisp  precode     Camera  class  ownerTform  focusGravityAffected  WallsPBlankLevel  CreepsMonsterList  FrameRateCap,lastframeinteger  BackgroundTBitmap  plochaTBitmap  RelativePosY,RelativePosXinteger  constructor createownerTform focusGravityAffected WallsPBlankLevel CreepsMonsterList FrameRateCapinteger backgroundTBitmap  procedure nextframe end         procedure camera.nextframe  var i,i1,top,topinfield, left,leftinfield integer     procedure Repair       some unimportant math here    Procedure vykreslicovec    begin    if co is gravityaffected then     plocha.Canvas.Drawco.PositionXfieldsizeGravityaffectedco.PosInFieldXLeftfieldsizeleftinfieldco.getImgPosX,      co.PositionYfieldsizeGravityaffectedco.PosInFieldYtopfieldsizetopinfieldco.getImgPosY,      co.image    else      plocha.Canvas.Drawco.PositionXfieldsizeLeftfieldsizeleftinfieldco.getImgPosX,      co.PositionYfieldsizetopfieldsizetopinfieldco.getImgPosY,      co.image    end   begin     some more unimportant math    vykreslifocus                                                     For i Left1 to left2plocha.Width div fieldsize do                                                         vykreslen zd    For i1 Top1 to top2plocha.Height div fieldsize do     if ilt Walls.LevelSizeX and i1lt Walls.LevelSizeY and igt0 and i1gt0 and walls.IsZedi,i1 then      begin vykresliwalls.GiveZedi,i1end    while absgettickcount mod highwordlastframe lt 1000 div FrameRateCap do sleep1    lastframegettickcount mod high word    owner.Canvas.Drawfieldsize,fieldsize,plocha        end codepre  pCan someone please tell me what am I doing wrongp

I want to create a myschema.orders table with only the orders placed after 1Jan2010. This condition reduces the table from 15 to 1.5 million records.p  pMy problem I want myschema.orders to have the same constraints and indices as public.orders, but Id like to add them after populating the table as this should be faster. Id rather not use a view because it would be much slower. I can dop  precodecreate table myschema.orders like public.orders including all insert into myschema.orders select  public.orders where MyCondition  True codepre  pThe first line copies all constraints excluding foreign keys and indices before populating the table. The code works, but is about 15 times slower than inserting the same records into a table with no constraints.p  pWhat is the easiest way to populate the table first, and then copying the constraints Or can I maybe disable and then reenable the constraints I need to do this for about 30 tables, each of which with about 10 constraints and 7 indices, so Id like to automate the process as much as possible.p  pThank youp

Negative 5948 pI was considering using the Python PyPI package codepyinotifycode, but got concerned when I saw this post   a hrefhttpwww.serpentine.comblog20080104whyyoushouldnotusepyinotify relnofollowWhy you should not use pyinotifyap  pThis post is from 012008, and pyinotify has been actively maintained since then up through the last commit on 8162014 [a hrefhttpsgithub.comsebmpyinotify relnofollowgithub repositorya] at the time of this post, and the last PyPI version uploaded on 20121115, so Im wondering if these issues have been resolved  The issues from the post arep  ol liA program using pyinotify can easily lose track of parts of its directory hierarchy. The library doesnt raise an OSError exception if the inotifyaddwatch system call fails instead, it propagates the 1 error result up to the caller as a value in a dict, but without the value of errno to tell the caller why the error occurred.  Its thus trivial to miss errors entirely, because the usual mechanism of raising exceptions isnt used.li liAlmost as bad, its impossible to distinguish between recoverable tried to add a watch on a directory that no longer exists and fatal hit the system maxuserwatches limit errors.li liUnder the hood, though, the implementation is terrible. On every event, the library scans every event that the inotify interface could possibly report, and checks to see if your class implements one of several possible appropriately named methods. This means its traversing a 20element dict, and performing up to 60 attribute lookups of which up to 40 are based on formatted names, for every reported event.br This has disastrous performance implications. If you write a simple monitoring tool that uses pyinotify, use it to monitor activity in a Linux kernel source tree, and then start a build in that tree, try running top while your build runs. When I did this, I found that pyinotify was consuming an entire CPU trying to keep up with the flood of notification events.li liAll that needless attribute lookup churn isnt the only problem pyinotify uses a threading.RLock to protect every access to every attribute of its Watch class, by providing its own codegetattributecode and codesetattrcode methods.br I cant guess what the author thinks hes protecting himself from, but hes got a solid defence mounted against both correctness and performance there. Blindly locking individual attributes isnt going to protect the consistency of an entire data structure, and delegating responsibility for locking out to callers, who are probably all singlethreaded anyway, might help to recover a bit of the execrable performance. Watch isnt often on the fast path, thank goodness.li ol  pNotes  p  ul liBryan OSullivan, the author of that post, wrote pythoninotify to resolve those issues a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgbospythoninotify relnofolloworiginal bitbucket repository by Bryan OSullivana a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypipythoninotify relnofollowPyPI pagea a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgJanKanispythoninotify relnofollownew repo by Jan Kanisa .

Lets assume that this bean doesnt have the setter method for database path. I will have some kind of event and a listener for this event. Listener should reinitialize TestBean with new path. p  pIs this possiblep  pI was thinking of some kind of wrapper. In such case I would have class TestBeanWrapper which will have method get which will return TestBean instance and recreateString path which will create new object with given path.p  pIm not sure exactly if such wrapper would work for me, as the TestBean is a class from external library, and Im not sure if its not injected somewhere but probably its not injected.p  pMore possible is that the other beans may rely on TestBean, so they also must be reinitialized in case if they wont have setters for my TestBean.p  pIs this even possible in Spring 4.1  What is the best approach for such casesp

Negative 5948 pThe question might otherwise be stated as to flatten or not to flattenp  pIf I were to store nested JSON documents in a DocumentDB collection, would querying across those nested structures perform on par with having stored those nested structures in a separate collection as flat documents on their ownp  pThe data in question will be written once and likely never updated.  Reporting performance is at the top of the requirements list.p  pOn one hand, storing the data in a nested structure seems like the correct way to make use of the noschema  no SQL technology.  That is, we naturally want to associate header data with detail data all in one place and in context.  But can it scale and continue to perform once were writing thousands of rows a minute while simultaneously running reports on that collection from a web applicationp  pOr, would it be better to flatten out that detail data, redundantly storing relevant parts of the header data in each row of the detail collection  As a longtime RDBMS developer  user, I tend to want to not store data redundantly, but should I let go of that idea in favor of high performancep  pDoes a flat data structure query more efficiently in DocumentDB and by how much of a margin  That is, what am I giving up by doing that, and is it worth it if performance is a top but not the only priorityp

Negative 5948 pThere are many iOS games where you can see that first is shown launch image, and then after certain amount of time, the preloader is added. Just after about a second, or maybe even two, and that is a noticeable delay. I was wondering why is that, and I am thinking that something like this is happeningp  ul lilaunch image is shown because view is not ready yet li linow, about second or two later, the view is ready, launch image is removed, scene is initializedli lithen, preloader is added to the scene or this is done directly in view controller and after resources are loaded, the completition handler is called which removes preloader, and user now can use the interfaceli ul  pAnd because of the part while view is being initialized, the preloader cant be shown immediately right when a launch image is shown  But if there is no view object yet, how is launch image shown I think I am missing something...p  pSo, the question is, at which point the launch image is presentedremoved in app startup sequence exactly  After which eventmethod execution  I suppose its removed after something like viewWillAppear is executed for the first time I hope this make some sense..p

Negative 5948 pI am interested in what happens when executing the codecallcode instruction of the assembly code Visual C is compiled to. What I think happens is that the call instruction itself pushes all context onto the stack register content, PC, ... and updates the PC. But then again, I wonder whether all context is pushed or not. In many cases, not all registers are used within the function called. Do the compiler detect this and only push the context that is modified by the function, or is pushing all context implemented so cheaply at the hardware level that it is always donep

Negative 5948 pI know that its possible to save backups on a remote location, but can I backup a remote location I have a server with data and a pc, that will keep the backups, on the same network. I can mount the data from the server on the pc, using sshfs and backup the mounted folder. I want to make backups daily and keep backups for at least a month. The question is, what will happen if the server stops or the connection is lost Will Deja Dup make backup of an empty folder and on the next day, when all the files are reachable, make an incremental backup, which will do a backup of everything again The server has about 300gb of data, that has to be backed up. On the first day, a 300gb backup will be made. Incremental backups will be small, about 5080mb a day, but if the connection gets lost there will be an empty backup and on the next day a 300gb incremental backup. If the connection gets lost 5 times a month, that means that there will be 1.5TB of useless incremental backups.p

I have it set with respect to the first on v1 call to it. If I hit Continue which should then execute until my breakpoint condition is true, the debugger appears to stop at the beginning of the strongnextstrong  call to codeCountObjectsPerFrame3code on v2, strongNOTstrong in codeCountObjectsPerFrame3code itself, as if it had finished processing the codev1code call.  I can, at that point, manually use the step into feature and get myself into the current state of codeCountObjectsPerFrame3code in codeCountObjectsPerFrame3code and find that in fact Im still executing my v1 call and its at the next iteration rather than having proceeded to the conditional e.g. if I set a breakpoint conditional at codeiv100code and the last time it was codeiv1code and I hit Continue though it appears to have finished the v1 call, its actually in the v1 call but at codeiv2code, not codeiv100codep  pSo, is there a proper way to set a conditional breakpoint in a template class method in vs2012 that works.  The fact that I have to do the manual step into feature to actually get back, visually, into codeCountObjectsPerFrame3code is annoying but the fact that it seems to ignore the conditional of the breakpoint thereby requiring me to use Continue to manually step 100s of iterations pretty much blind as I dont know what iteration Im on makes debugging this pretty much impossible.p

Negative 5948 pI have already programmed a basic invoicing system using PHPMySQL which has a table structure as followsp  pInvoice table invoiceid, invoicedate, customerid, etc Invoice line table invoicelineid, invoiceid, quantity, price, description, etcp  pI need the system to automatically generate future invoices at set intervals for example every 1 week or every 2 months, etc. I was thinking of creating a new table as followsp  pInvoice schedule table invoicescheduleid, invoiceid, interval e.g. 1, intervalunit months, start date, nextprocessingdatep  pMy idea was to then setup a cron job which would execute a PHP file once a day. The PHP file would then generate an invoice when the nextprocessingdate matched todays date and update the nextprocessingdate in the database. Im comfortable on how to achieve this but what Im stuck with is how to actually insert the new invoice into the tabledatabase. Does MySQL have any type of copy row feature as the new invoice would be identical to the original one except for the invoicedate having to be updated.p

Negative 5948 pIm making a simple IRC bot in Perl that can be used to hunt ducks in response to a hrefhttpsgithub.comjnmtxCloudBotblobgonzobotpluginsduckhunt.py relnofollowthis IRC game bota. Im doing this on a private scripting channel, codeirc.freenode.net duckhunt2code so as not to interfere with real people playing the game.p  pSo far Ive tried making a Perl bot using a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpodNetIRC relnofollowcodeNetIRCcodea and a plugin for XChat, a hrefhttpsgithub.compr1m4zu1IRCHunterBot relnofollowwith my code herea. The duck source bot sends a message like p  precodeOlt quack codepre  pa random amount of time in between 860 minutes since the last duck was shot to let you know that a duck has arrived. You can then reply with code.bangcode to shoot the duck and get one point added to your score. However, if you reply too quickly within one second, it puts you in a 2 hour cooldown mode where you cant shoot any ducks. Sometimes it also throws in 7 second cooldowns because of jammed guns and such, as shown in line 272 of the game bot code.p  h3Perl codeh3  precodeuse NetIRC use TimeHiRes qwusleep nanosleep  ducksource  DUCKSOURCE server      IRCSERVER channel     IRCCHANNEL botnick     BOTNICKNAME botnick2    BOTBACKUPNICKNAME password    BOTPASSWORD botadmin    BOTADMINNICKNAME  irc  new NetIRC  conn  ircgtnewconn     Nick     gt botnick,     Server   gt server,     Port     gt IRCSERVERPORT,     Username gt botnick   conngtaddglobalhandler376,        amponconnect conngtaddglobalhandlerdisconnect, ampondisconnect conngtaddglobalhandlerkick,       amponkick conngtaddglobalhandlermsg,        amponmsg conngtaddglobalhandlerpublic,     amponpublic  ircgtstart  sub onconnect       self  shift      selfgtprivmsgnickserv, identify password     selfgtjoinchannel      print Connectedn   sub ondisconnect       self  shift      print Disconnected, attempting to reconnectn     selfgtconnect   sub onkick       self  shift      selfgtjoinchannel     selfgtprivmsgnickserv, nick botnick   sub onmsg       self   shift     event  shift      if eventgtnick eq botadmin           foreach arg eventgtargs               if arg  muptime                  selfgtprivmsgbotadmin, uptime                              sub onpublic       self   shift     event  shift      if eventgtnick eq ducksource           foreach arg eventgtargs               if arg  mlt ampamp arg  mgt                  usleep250000                 selfgtprivmsgchannel, .bang                           if    arg  mmissed                  arg  mjammed                  arg  mluck                  arg  mWTF                  selfgtprivmsgnickserv, nick botnick2                 selfgtprivmsgchannel,   .bang                 selfgtprivmsgnickserv, nick botnick                           if arg  mscript  arg  mperiod                  selfgtprivmsgnickserv, nick botnick2                 selfgtprivmsgchannel,   .bang                             codepre  pThe Perl bot connects to the server, joins the chat room, and responds to a duck appearing, but I cant get it to delay the sending of the command code.bangcode so that the game bot receives it after 1 second has passed and I dont go into the twohour cooldown mode.p  pI know that the Perl codesleepcode command only accept multiples of one second. I need to delay 0.25 seconds because it takes about 0.75 seconds for the message to reach the game bot, so Ive tried using TimeHiRes and the codeusleepcode command, which uses microseconds 1,000 microseconds  1 millisecond.p  pOn line 61 of my code, I added codeusleep250000code which should make the script pause for 0.25s before sending the message on the next linep  precodeselfgtprivmsgchannel, .bang codepre  pBut the script does not wait  it just sends the message as normal. It acts like it is ignoring the codeusleepcode command.p  pHow can I fix this and make the bot wait before it sends the messagep  pSecondly, Im confused over how to change nicknames. If the game bot gives me a 7 second cooldown, Id like to quickly change my nick to another nick e.g. codeHunterBot6000code to codeHunterBot6000code shoot the duck code.bangcode, and change my nick back before another bot gets the duck. Typically you accomplish a nick change through the codenick NEWNICKcode command. However, Ive tried sending this command to the channel and emNickServem, and this doesnt change my nickname. How should I accomplish thisp  pI also tried writing an XChat plugin for the script to see if that would get rid of the timing issue, but that doesnt work either. After connecting to the server and joining the chat room in XChat, I load the plugin, and I have the same issue  it responds to ducks with code.bangcode but I cannot get it to wait before sending.p  pYou can see the documentation a hrefhttpxchatdata.netScriptingBasicPerlScript relnofollowemWriting a simple XChat Perl Scriptema.

Negative 5948 pIm curious as to why Dart doesnt flag a super class as being an incorrect type when its passed in via an inherited type argument Taking the inherited type as the parameter means the inherited types interface should expect to be utilised, which the super class might not have.

Negative 5948 pYes. I have a codeUIViewControllercode called codeNavigatorViewControllercode. This is a custom navigation structure which includes different slots where I can add content and swipe between these  this is not important for the actual problem, but just so you get the code. Slot number 4 is added in the codeNavigatorViewControllercode like thisp  precodeslot4  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierview4] slot4.view.frame  CGRectMakescreenWidth2, 0.0, screenWidth, screenHeight [self.view addSubviewslot4.view] codepre  pwhich works fine. I see the codeUIViewControllercode codeview4code that I added in the storyboard on the right spot.p  pInside this slot4 UIViewController I want to add another subview. Another UIViewController called codeChatViewControllercode. I add it with these linesp  precodeUIStoryboard storyboard  [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMain bundlenil] ChatViewController viewController  ChatViewController [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierChat] viewController.view.tag  266 [slot4.view addSubviewviewController.view] codepre  pSo far so good  it also works fine. BUT..p  pMy problem is that inside the ChatViewController there is a UITextView called codechatTextViewcode. I have set thisp  precodeinterface ChatViewController  UIViewController ltUITextViewDelegategt ...  codepre  pin the codeChatViewControllercode header, because I want to get the action from codechatTextViewcode. So fx. when the codechatTextViewcode becomes firstResponder, it will call some kind of action. To make that happen I have to set p  precodechatTextView.delegate  self codepre  pinside the codeChatViewControllercodes codeviewDidLoadcode method. p  pBut when I run the project and click on the codechatTextViewcode, it crashes.  I get an error message sayingp  precodeThread 1 EXCBADACCESS code1, address0xXXXXXXXXX codepre  pWhen I set the codechatTextViewcodes delegate to codenilcode theres no errors, but then I cannot use it p  pPlease ask if I forgot somethingp

When a server only exists in Results2 and not in Results1, I loose the Name attribute for that server, which is a big issue.  When a server exists in both Results1 and Results2, or only in Results1, it works as I want it too. p  pI know that I only select Results1.Name, but I dont know how to handle them both without having them end up in different columns. p  pCould anyone help me with a PSQL query which is able to handle thisp

In addition, codeFlushConsoleInputBuffercode nicely returns false, when it runs on Cygwin xterm or mintty.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI suspect that Cygwin handles stdin separately than Windows native stdin, which make codeFlushConsoleInputBuffercode fail.p  pwallyk yes. flush means dropping all unread buffered inputs.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong   final answer accepted and reasonp  pTony D is right.  The problem is that Cygwin terminal is a unixlike terminal, which allows editing before ENTER key is hit.  Thus any partial input must be buffered and will never be passed to stdin before the ENTER key is hit, since it expects editing commands.  I guess it should be possible to overcome this by setting terminal to raw mode not experimented.  Yet the editing feature will be lost in the raw mode.p
Negative 5948 pSorry in advance for my English.p  pIm doing scripts in unity and what I want to achieve isp  pI have a multiple classes B1, B2, B3 and every one of them inherit from A class. In my code I have container for A objects, that mostly contain B classes. A class and B classes have function called MyFunction and there is the problem when I want to call this function on object of class i.e. B2, when its in vector for A class objects, when I call MyFunction, there is executed version from A, not from B2. I tried to solve this problem in best way I could, but I ended with if B1, then ... else if B2, then ... type of solution which is not something I want.p  pAs example of my ugly solution used in ImmaDed , I link my scripts, without every line that is not needed in this examplep  pa hrefhttppastebin.com4BY0RkBN relnofollowhttppastebin.com4BY0RkBNap  pThank you very much for any effort in advance.p

Negative 5948 pI am looking to add scroll support to more than just a single, scrollable, child view of codeCoordinatorLayoutcode in conjunction with an codeAppBarLayoutcode and codeCollapsingToolbarLayoutcode. When scrolling the codeRecyclerViewcode or the codeAppBarLayoutcode condensed code below, the app bar and its contents successfully scroll and collapse. However, when attempting to initiate a scroll event on the codeLinearLayoutcode above the codeRecyclerViewcode, nothing happens because the codeLinearLayoutcode does not know to scroll or collapse the view.p  pThe goal is to have the codeLinearLayoutcode act as a sticky header to the codeRecyclerViewcode and footer to the codeAppBarLayoutcode and receive the same scrolling behavior as the codeRecyclerViewcode, similar to a hrefhttpimg.wonderhowto.comimg9130635433151714870trickspotifyintoplayinganysongitsfreeandroidapp.w654.jpg relnofollowSpotifys shuffle playavailable offline headera. In fact, it would be great if the codeappbarscrollingviewbehaviorcode codelayoutbehaviorcode could be applied to the codeLinearLayoutcode similarly to the codeRecyclerViewcode, but I imagine that the behavior is ignored on nonscrollable views. Is anyone aware of a workaround for this that does not require implementing the codeLinearLayoutcode view as a row in the codeRecyclerViewcodep  precodeltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout         androidididappbarlayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightdimencollapsibleappbarheight         androidthemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBargt          ltandroid.support.design.widget.CollapsingToolbarLayout             androidididcollapsingtoolbarlayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightmatchparent             androidbackgrounddrawablegradientbanner             appcontentScrimcolorbackgroundcontentframe             applayoutscrollFlagsscrollexitUntilCollapsedgt              ltImageView                 androidididimageheader                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidsrcdrawablesomeimage                 applayoutcollapseModeparallaxgt              ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar                 androidididcollapsibletoolbar                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightattractionBarSize                 androidthemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar                 applayoutcollapseModepingt          ltandroid.support.design.widget.CollapsingToolbarLayoutgt      ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayoutgt      ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightdimenslidehandleheight         androidorientationhorizontal         androidbackgroundcolorslidehandle         androidgravitycenterverticalgt          lt three buttons gt      ltLinearLayoutgt      ltandroid.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView         androidididrecyclerview         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidlayoutmarginTopdimenslidehandleheight         androidscrollbarsvertical         applayoutbehaviorstringappbarscrollingviewbehaviorgt  ltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayoutgt codepre

Negative 5948 pMaybe this is too broad but I currently cant break it down to smaller questions because I am not sure where to go yet.p  pI need some advice about finding the right approach for a project. Since I am an electrical engineer, I have some trouble narrowing down the options because there are so many technologiespossibilities I am not really familiar with. p  pI have several years of experience developing Windows Forms applications in C, but not much of a clue about Web technologies.p  pWhat has to be achieved is something like thisp  ul liThere is a Windows server maybe run simple Win7  Win10 with several devices connected to a virtual COM port. It must be possible to communicate indirectly with the mentioned devices from any other PC on the LAN by using a dedicated Windows Forms application and alternately by using a web browser accessing a specific WEB page on the server.li liThere needs to be a common data store that stores configuration data, log information, user data and so on. The windows application is primarily used for configuration and to presentedit lots of data at once. The WEB application should provide a more general interface that allows to perform some basic functions and interaction with the available devices.li ul  pWhat I came up with so farp  ul liThe COMPort probably cant and shouldnt be directly accessed from a remote machine or through a WEB application, so I require some kind of proxy that could act as a high level interface.li liA windows service that runs on the server could provide a communication interface to the COM port, by listening on a specific socket using a proprietary protocol to execute different functions. The other application could then connect to the service.li liThe server would have to run some kind of WEBServer. I read about IIS, which seems to be an appropriate native choice for ASP.NET.li liThe Entity Framework 6 seems like a good choice for simple ORM database interface which could be used with MySQL or FireBird. I would have to be used by all three applications Service, ASP, Forms.li ul  pQuestionsp  ul liIs my concept generally flawedli liI read about inter process communication technologies but since I also have to interact with a ASP.NET application, using a Socket seems to be the easiest choice. Are there better options or alternativesli liWould using MySQL or Firebird be appropriate I used both in the past in conjunction with NHibernate. However the Entity Framework 6 seems to be pretty mature and is native to .NET. Any thoughtsli liIf I dont get it wrong, I would have to implement essentially the same data access code in every of the three applications. That sound like a maintenance nightmare when the schema gets updated for example. Is there a better wayli liWould using IIS as WEB server be a good choice I really dont have any experience there. li ul  pAny thoughts are welcome.p

And in the laptop also Ubuntu 14.04 the trayicon appears on the left side of the taskbar but in this case it does shows me the menu and a message when I double click the icon.p  pI dont know if theres another way to do this but here its my code.p  precodeif QSystemTrayIconisSystemTrayAvailable    trayicon   trayIcon  new QSystemTrayIconthis   trayIcongtsetIconQIconImagenesiconosPERFQ23.png   trayIcongtsetToolTiptrPerfQ Client   trayIcongtsetVisibletrue    connecttrayIcon, SIGNALactivatedQSystemTrayIconActivationReason,                  this, SLOTiconActivatedQSystemTrayIconActivationReason   Menu   logoutAction  new QActiontrampLogout, this   trayIconMenu  new QMenuthis   trayIconMenugtaddActionlogoutAction    Add the menu to the trayicon   trayIcongtsetContextMenutrayIconMenu    connect logoutAction,SIGNALtriggered, this, SLOTlogout  codepre  pand the slot for the activated signal on the trayiconp  precodevoid TaskiconActivatedQSystemTrayIconActivationReason reason    switch reason        case QSystemTrayIconDoubleClick       QMessageBoxinformationthis,Double Click, Double click has been press on trayicon       break     default            codepre
Negative 5948 pI am working in MatLab with the parallel computing toolbox.p  pstrongTaskstrongp  pI have a vector v. I have 4 cores.
