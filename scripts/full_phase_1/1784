Positive 1784 pWe have a VB.NET program that is using Supergoos ABCPDF version 6.1.1.2. Our program takes standard XML strings and places values in a corresponding PDF form field on the template PDF. p  pProblemp  pWe have over 3000 PDF files that have all been tagged with form fields. There could be up to 50 form fields on the template PDFs for a total of roughly 150,000 form fields in use potentially. We have noticed that some of these form fields have their form field common properties set to hidden by mistake. see screenshota hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHco2C.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHco2C.png altenter image description hereap  pThe issue is that the PDF coming back after the string values have been added are not showing up.

However, there is no way to know how many other of the other 150,000 form fields have been improperly tagged like this.p  pDoes anyone know if I can adjust the PDF generation program to forcefully ignore that form field common property Here is a sample of the vb.net code I am hoping to slightly alter...p  precode Dim theDoc As Doc  New Doc  theDoc.Form.FieldsSampleFieldName. can we set something here to ignore the hidden property codepre

So far so good. However the pdf generated after programmatically filling in these fields is visually inconsistent. The radio buttons have all reverted to squares and the selected Spanish has a wingdings  cross within it rather than a dot. The fields are all still editable.

On the other hand I should be able to produce documentation from it, i.e. to html, which would include the code fragments in some distinctive style, execute them like in Snippet Compiler, or Linqpad and include the results in the appropriate place.p  pThe benefits would be huge Id detect many incompatibilities in the documentation, it could be refactored, and if I change the output of some function, the documentation would autoupdate.p  pBut maybe theres a far simpler approach that gets me 90 there.

If you take a look at the ClientProfile structure,       in the first post, youll see two ints       clientNIFclientAge and one char clientName.

Why everything is being copied but the strings           currPtrgtclientProfile  tempPtrgtclientProfile             D              Is there anyway to not call the function itself       and make the while loop once again and delete the       corresponding leaf           return deleteClientFromTreeampcurrPtrgtrightTree, tempPtrgtclientProfilegtclientName                     return FALSE  codepre

Negative 1784 pSo I have a subclass of a UIView that starts causing EXCBADACCESS errors when I go through a specific set of conditions run on iPad instead of iPhone or simulator, first login only.

Negative 1784 pWere developing a server system in Scala  Akka for a game that will serve clients in Android, iPhone, and Second Life.  There are parts of this server that need to be highly available, running on multiple machines.  If one of those servers dies of, say, hardware failure, the system needs to keep running.  I think I want the clients to have a list of machines they will try to connect with, similar to how Cassandra works.p  pThe multinode examples Ive seen so far with Akka seem to me to be centered around the idea of scalability, rather than high availability at least with regard to hardware. The multinode examples seem to always have a single point of failure.  For example there are load balancers, but if I need to reboot one of the machines that have load balancers, my system will suffer some downtime.p  pAre there any examples that show this type of hardware fault tolerance for Akka Or, do you have any thoughts on good ways to make this happenp  pSo far, the best answer Ive been able to come up with is to study the Erlang OTP docs, meditate on them, and try to figure out how to put my system together using the building blocks available in Akka.p  pBut if there are resources, examples, or ideas on how to share state between multiple machines in a way that if one of them goes down things keep running, Id sure appreciate them, because Im concerned I might be reinventing the wheel here.  Maybe there is a multinode STM container that automatically keeps the shared state in sync across multiple nodes  Or maybe this is so easy to make that the documentation doesnt bother showing examples of how to do it, or perhaps I havent been thorough enough in my research and experimentation yet.  Any thoughts or ideas will be appreciated.p

Negative 1784 pIn .NET, TypeMock Isolator and Microsoft Moles allow one to isolate any class, property, or method  be it sealed, static, protected or nonvirtual. So what was impossible to mock in Moq or Rhino Mocks, now no longer is the case.p  pIve always had some aversion with the idea of using an interface merely to be able to allow for mocking, when otherwise just the concrete class would exist. Im not alone in this view see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions90851isitjustmeorareinterfacesoverusedherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions956011uselessinterfacesherea, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2659366javainterfacesmethodologyshouldeveryclassimplementaninterfaceherea. In the later its implied that modern mocking frameworks no longer need interfaces for testing or dependency injection.p  pHowever, while I cant speak for TypeMock Isolator, I can say that using Mocks in Microsoft Moles is extremely slow. Having code like the following in unit tests makes the speed of the test too slow to be used oftenp  precodeMFile.ReadAllLinesString  s gt csvDataCorrectlyFormatted MDirectoryInfo.AllInstances.GetFilesString  di,fi gt fileInfoArray MFileInfo.AllInstances.NameGet  fi gt Doesnt Matter codepre  pIm sure that if the method being tested was programmed to an interface or abstract base class so that the file system code could be abstracted away in a wrapper of sorts that using frameworks like Moq for stubbing or mocking would end up being faster. But then we are back to the situation of having added production code complexity for basically the ability to unit test.p  pIm leaning to the opinion that Isolator and Moles should only be used when one cant mock with traditional mocking frameworks. Yet, I still struggle with notion of having added production code complexity for the sake of testing. p  pIm curious what the rest of the community thinks.p  pstrongUPDATE 100610strong By saying I struggle with the notion of having added production code complexity for the the sake of testing, Im referring to the adding an interface or abstract class even when otherwise one isnt needed, such as when making the concrete class nonsealed and methods virtual would do. The latter still allows seams for testing. Even if later one finds the need to use an interface for multiple implementations, couldnt they extract it from the class But unless that need arises, why not follow a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiYouain27tgonnaneeditYAGNIa. p  pIm all for the SOLID principles where they make the architecture of a program easier to maintain. I dont think these principles need to be followed religiously in every case. I think the mantra, It always depends, comes into play many times. Otherwise, one is left with every concrete type having an interface or abstract base class, even when there will be only one implementation.p  pLastly, Im not saying that because Isolator and Moles allows one to get around isolation limitations in dynamicproxybased frameworks that one shouldnt still design architecture to be maintainable. In many cases, the SOLID principles are what is best, and thus Isolator or Moles wouldnt be needed. Its the cases where the interface is used solely for testing that I am questioning. Im bringing up another side point about speed too. If one chooses to use Isolator and Moles it appears to bring a speed penalty. So I certainly dont think that they make dynamicproxybased frameworks obsolete.p

Negative 1784 pIm an administrator for a wiki using MediaWiki, and one of our sponsored links has requested that we add the relnofollow attribute to their links, since they are trying to comply with a new google policy.

Negative 1784 pAre there any guidelines on when you should use a delegate for indirect association, and an observerp  pIn C, you get to use delegates for simple callbacks. I guess pointers to function and pointers to member functions can be considered as delegates too am I right.p  pI realize that do use an observer, you need to create an interface, and implement it, so it is more stronglytyped and the relationship is more formal. For a delegate, as long as the function signature and accessibility matches, you can hook them up.p  pDoes delegates make the observer pattern moot How do you decide on a delegate vs. an observer patternp

Secondly, I assume that in this case anonymously tracking app usage  no user or device data I am allowed to use the service without the need to say anywhere in the app that analytics is being used so the 3.3.9. of a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comprogramstermsiosstandardiosstandardagreement20110215.pdf relnofollowiOS Developer Program License Agreementa doesnt apply here.p  pCan anyone confirm my assumptions or explain if they are not right Or better strongdid anyone of you have your app using analytics approved even though it didnt say anywhere it is using itstrong ...or the oppositep  pIve seen plenty of forum entries on the subject none of them though clearly stating what is required by Apple and what is just recommended.p  pThanksp

However, its also running code in a DLL which I cant modify thats been built with VS2005 and when code in that DLL prints to the clog stream it does it via MSVCR80.DLL and MSVCP80.DLL.  Heres the problem if I reroute stdclog in my code, I only affect code built against crt 9.0 libs, code using the older crt 8.0 wont have its output rerouted.  So is there a way to reroute the clog stream in a DLL built against an older CRTp  pIve investigated calling GetModuleHandle and GetProcAddress on the older CRT DLLs and have managed to reroute the C stderr stream via openosfhandle and dup2, however the C clog stream still seems to be unaffected.

I do have a ViewModel for the list items wrapping the domain objects. When I open the view I have a second list that will get populated with an ViewModel instance for each domain object. An THAT is the real problem. Since the target collection is bound to my DataGrid, I have to dispatch the creation of the ViewModels into the UI thread otherwise .Net is not very happy about the collection change from another thread. So I am polluting the Dispatcher queue with 20,000 view model creation calls. Creating a ViewModel is pretty cheap, but I still have 20,000 calls in the dispatcher queue and at the same time the DataGrid is demanding CPU in the same thread to fill itself. p  pMy idea not quite finished Since I already have UI virtualization in place, I would like to create the ViewModels NOT when I open my view, but on the fly then I need them. When the user can see the first 20 entries initially I only need to create 20 ViewModels and not 20,000. And here is my problem I have no idea how. Thats where you come in p  pI would like to have something like this not working that way .. just to show what I meanp  precodeltDataGrid ItemsSourceBinding MyDomainOjectCollectiongt     ltDataGrid.RowStylegt         ltStylegt             ltSetter PropertyDataContext                      ValueBinding DataContext,                              ConverterStaticResource  MyViewModelFactoryConvertergt             ltSettergt         ltStylegt     ltDataGrid.RowStylegt ltDataGridgt codepre  pIt does not have to be a Converter, it can also be something else or be done in code behind. I dont care. All I need is Bind directly to the DomainObject collection, create the corresponding ViewModels on the fly and use the just created ViewModel instead of the original object to fill a single row. Any ideasp
Negative 1784 pI have a question here that looks a little like some of the ones that I found in search, but with solutions for slightly different problems and, importantly, ones that dont work in SQL 2000.p  pI have a very large table with a lot of redundant data that I am trying to reduce down to just the useful entries. Its a history table, and the way it works, if two entries are essentially duplicates and consecutive when sorted by date, the latter can be deleted. The data from the earlier entry will be used when historical data is requested from a date between the effective date of that entry and the next nonduplicate entry.p  pThe data looks something like thisp  precodeid     userid effectivedate importantvalue uselessvalue 1      1       132007       3               0 2      1       142007       3               1 3      1       162007       NULL            1 4      1       212007       3               0 5      2       152007       12              1 6      3       111899       7               0 codepre  pWith this sample set, we would consider two consecutive rows duplicates if the codeuseridcode and the codeimportantvaluecode are the same. From this sample set, we would only delete row with codeidcode2, preserving the information from 132007, showing that the codeimportantvaluecode changed on 162007, and then showing the relevant change again on 212007.p  pMy current approach is awkward and timeconsuming, and I know there must be a better way. I wrote a script that uses a cursor to iterate through the codeuseridcode values since that breaks the huge table up into manageable pieces, and creates a temp table of just the rows for that user. Then to get consecutive entries, it takes the temp table, joins it to itself on the condition that there are no other entries in the temp table with a date between the two dates. In the pseudocode below, codeUDFSameOrNullcode is a function that returns 1 if the two values passed in are the same or if they are both NULL.p  precodeWHILE fetchstatus ltgt 1 BEGIN   SELECT  FROM History INTO history WHERE userid  UserId    return entries to delete   SELECT h2.id   INTO deletehistoryids   FROM history h1   JOIN history h2 ON     h1.effectivedate lt h2.effectivedate     AND dbo.UDFSameOrNullh1.importantvalue, h2.importantvalue1   WHERE NOT EXISTS SELECT 1 FROM history hx WHERE hx.effectivedate gt h1.effectivedate and hx.effectivedate lt h2.effectivedate    DELETE h1   FROM History h1   JOIN deletehistoryids dh ON     h1.id  dh.id     FETCH NEXT FROM UserCursor INTO UserId END  codepre  pIt also loops over the same set of duplicates until there are none, since taking out rows creates new consecutive pairs that are potentially dupes. I left that out for simplicity.p  pUnfortunately, I must use SQL Server 2000 for this task and I am pretty sure that it does not support ROWNUMBER for a more elegant way to find consecutive entries.p  pThanks for reading. I apologize for any unnecessary backstory or errors in the pseudocode.p

Negative 1784 pThis is a ridiculous question but I cant find an answer.  Have looked into floating point arithmetic and a few other topics but nothing has seemed to address this.

Negative 1784 pGoogles Protocol Buffers allows you to store floats and doubles in messages.

If I understand a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comdocscdE1865901html8211384bjbds.htmlthis page by Oracle describing the format used for number on SPARCa correctly, the SPARC uses the opposite endian as x86 for integers embut the same endian as x86 for floats and doublesem.  However, PB encodes floatsdoubles by first casting them directly to an integer type of the appropriate size via means of a union  see the snippets of code quoted in my question above, and then reversing the order of the bytes on platforms with bigendian integersp  precodevoid CodedOutputStreamWriteLittleEndian64uint64 value    uint8 bytes[sizeofvalue]    bool usefast  buffersize gt sizeofvalue   uint8 ptr  usefast  buffer  bytes    WriteLittleEndian64ToArrayvalue, ptr    if usefast      Advancesizeofvalue    else      WriteRawbytes, sizeofvalue      inline uint8 CodedOutputStreamWriteLittleEndian64ToArrayuint64 value,                                                             uint8 target  if definedPROTOBUFLITTLEENDIAN   memcpytarget, ampvalue, sizeofvalue else   uint32 part0  staticcastltuint32gtvalue   uint32 part1  staticcastltuint32gtvalue gtgt 32    target[0]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0   target[1]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0 gtgt  8   target[2]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0 gtgt 16   target[3]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0 gtgt 24   target[4]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1   target[5]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1 gtgt  8   target[6]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1 gtgt 16   target[7]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1 gtgt 24 endif   return target  sizeofvalue  codepre  pThis, however, is exactly the wrong thing for it to be doing in the case of floatsdoubles on SPARC since the bytes are already in the correct order.p  pSo in conclusion, if my understanding is correct then floating point numbers are strongnotstrong transportable between SPARC and x86 using PB, because essentially PB assumes that all numbers are stored with the same endianess relative to other platforms as the integers on a given platform, which is an incorrect assumption to make on SPARC.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pAs Lyke pointed out, IEEE 64bit floating points emareem stored in bigendian order on SPARC, in contrast to x86.  However, only the two 32bit words are in reverse order, not all 8 of the bytes, and in particular IEEE 32bit floating points look like they are stored in the same order as on x86.p

Negative 1784 pIve got a client who wants an ASP.NET MVC application.  Ill develop it with VS.NET 2010 Express, demo it to him on my Linux server during its development Mono supports ASP.NET MVC, and hell eventually host it on a commercial provider running IIS.p  pGetting this done quickly is the name of the game.  The only piece Im missing here is the database layer.  Ideally Id use SQL CE and EF4.  But SQL CE only works on Windows, and Mono doesnt support the Entity Framework anyway.p  pThe only free Linq to SQLlike option I see is DbLinq. A quick test with that on a MySQL database had it erroring out on a table that had two foreign keys to a single primary key. A search on Google shows that this bug was identified, and a patch was created, two years ago or so.  That the patch still hasnt been applied to the main source by now, and that this bug seems to affect so a common scenario, does not fill me with confidence on the productionreadiness of DbLinq.p  pEven if it did work, itd have to be with MySQL, as thats the only database I can expect to be available on both Linux and an eventual Windows server.  SQLite, Berkeley DB, etc., would all require some native drivers be installed on the server, which I cant count on.p  pI dont know NHibernate.  But from what I read, it requires manually creating XML mapping files... so I dont have to write SQL statements, but I do have to create mapping files  Plus Id need to learn how to use it.  Like I said above Getting this done quickly is a goal here.p  pIf I must, I will just pony up the 5 a month or so for a cheap ASP.NET hosting provider and use that to demo progress to the client, using SQL CE and EF4.  But before I do that Id just like to see if there are any other viable options.  Its kind of mostly an intellectual exercise by this point.p  pSo... any tipsp

Negative 1784 pIm trying to analyze the tradeoffs between using SQLite vs. using resources for an app that needs to ship with a fairly sizeable amount of text several books. Ive read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5213550rawresourcesversussqlitedatabasethis post on raw XML files vs. SQLitea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7508859xmlresourcesorsqlitethis one on XML resources vs. SQLitea. Both of those, however, seem to be comparing SQLite to parsing XML at run time. I dont know if the same issues apply to using string and int resource arrays. I actually have a number of unknowns and Id appreciate any insights others can offer.p  pData details about 40 books three languages per book average book length 25 chapters average chapter length 25 paragraphs about 75,000 paragraphs total. Text is stored by paragraph no finer granularity needed. For each language, the apps logical view of the text is as a single array of paragraphs spanning all the books. There are also table of contents TOC data down to the paragraph level. All the data are strictly readonly. I need to support two query types 1 retrieve the text for a paragraph or range of paragraphs in a specified language 2 given a paragraph number, determine the book, chapter, and paragraph offset in the chapter. I dont need to use any of SQLites string functions.p  pMy analysis so farp  pstrongSQLitestrong Create an SQLite data base offline, package it as a raw resource or asset, and copy it to the data base location when the app is run for the first time andor upgraded. I have a implemented a prototype data base for this with half a dozen tables.p  ol liCan use SQL to query data base, so dont need to code any search algorithms.li liI know it can handle this much data.li liRequires several SQL range queries to answer type 2 queries.li liRequires twice the space in the .apk file and again when installed into the apps db area.li liAndroids SQLite implementation requires external storage SD card, so app wont work without one.

Badli ol  pstrongResourcesstrong Create a collection of xml array resource files offline and copy them to the projects resvalues folder. Text would be partitioned into many string arrays one array per chapter per book. There would be about 3,000 arrays. Indexes would be implemented as int arrays. For each book, the index data would be shared across languages. Id probably also need to generate some typed array resources to provide an index into the generated resource IDs. I expect that the index arrays are small enough to load entirely into memory at app startup.p  ol liType 1 queries involve loading the correct string arrays and accessing array elements. Type 2 queries involve binary search of the already loaded index data.li liDont know whether the resources system in Android can handle that many resource arrays.li liDont know what the performance would be compared to using SQLite.li ol  pI suppose a hybrid approach is also possible store the TOC data one way and the text itself in another.p  pAgain, Id appreciate any thoughts or insights that would help with this analysis.p

Negative 1784 pIm looking to write a .Net Windows application that will capture how a user uses another running application. p  pThe simplest form of this would be recording which buttons were clicked or menu items were opened.

In Windows are you able to listen to another applications events or are they hidden from other applications p  pIf so, are there any .Net libraries I can use or open source projects to catch these events Taking this further, turn these into generic events im thinking lots of applications might fire events specific to them, so extracting general information is keyp  pIf not, is the only solution to integrate my code with the application to gain access to the that applications eventsp  pMany thanksp

Negative 1784 pIn Monodroid Im trying to access a custom Java class through JNIEnv.  When I add the class in the main project I can access it in the main project and in a library project.p  pFor example If jniTest.java is an AndroidJavaSource file in Project A thenp  precodeIntPtr javaClass  JNIEnv.FindClasscomcompanyapplicationjniTest codepre  pworks from both Project A and from Library B.  However if I change it so that I take the same file and rename the class to jniText in Library B then I cannot access it in Library B withp  precodeIntPtr javaClass  JNIEnv.FindClasscomcompanyapplicationjniText codepre  pThe reason I say I have to rename the file because if I move the file to Library B such that its not in Project A anymore calling the FindClass will still find jniTest even though its in the library.  I believe it still finds it in the original location.  This led me to believe that when I moved the java file to my library that it was working fine.  It was only after a namespace change did it stop working because now the original that was somehow still built into Project A was now not the same as what was in Library B causing the codeNoClassDefFoundErrorcode.p  pIm hoping I just missed a project attribute or JNIEnv method but I cant find what to set to make this work.p  pThanks p

We realized that instead of generating 3000 objects per request, we could knock it down to about 200 objects.  We may have a bigger design issue but that is for another day.

Negative 1784 pAccording to the 2003 standards definition of a struct, it is a specialized case of a class, with different default access modifiers for members, functions, and base classes.  It also goes on to define the requirements of a struct to be a PODstruct.p  pC 2003 Standard, ISO 14882 Section 9.0.4p  blockquote   pA structure is a class defined with the classkey struct its members and base classes clause 10 are public   by default clause 11. A union is a class defined with the classkey union its members are public by   default and it holds only one data member at a time 9.5. [Note aggregates of class type are described in   8.5.1. ] A PODstruct is an aggregate class that has no nonstatic data members of type nonPODstruct,   nonPODunion or array of such types or reference, and has no userdefined copy assignment operator   and no userdefined destructor. Similarly, a PODunion is an aggregate union that has no nonstatic data   members of type nonPODstruct, nonPODunion or array of such types or reference, and has no userdefined   copy assignment operator and no userdefined destructor. A POD class is a class that is either a   PODstruct or a PODunion.p blockquote  pGiven this definition, the only differentiating factor between a nonPOD struct and a class is the default access modifier.  p  pHeres what I could imagine as the purpose of having nonPOD structsp  ul liTheyre a legacy feature that needs to be maintained for backwardscompatibilityli liTyping codepubliccode is hard.li ul  pHaving nonPOD structs can lead to pain when theyre assumed to be POD by other systems, for example when passed around to C and back.  To illustrate, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5955444canywaytoprogrammaticallydetectpodstructthis person ran into problems when a struct that was assumed to be POD was updated by another developer such that it was no longer PODa.  Because PODness isnt statically asserted by the compiler by default, the application would crash at runtime when that struct was used in contexts where only POD structs could be used.  Even worse, I could imagine though I dont know for certain if this is possible a nonPOD struct working in certain circumstances that require POD, and failing in others, leading to errors and crashes that are nothing short of arduous to track down.p  pSeeing as there are situations where having nonPOD structs can lead to the realm of bizarre and broken behavior, what is the use of nonPOD structs  Why arent structs statically checked for PODness at compiletime via stdispod in C11 or the Boost equivalentp

Negative 1784 pI have a class in both PHP and C to simply take a value string and salt string to do some salting for privacy. The idea is a PHP script will encrypt a string for a C program to receive and decrypt. They use a preshared salt string, synchronous mode.p  pThe issue is with what appears to be the same logic they generate a different result for encrypting the same string. This means that decrypting the string either end will not result in the original string it was given.p  pIt is probably something really simple I have missed or made a mistake on. Or possibly it is related to PHP using character encoding where as C is a raw bit stream. The PHP script is set to use a plain text output, with usascii encoding.p  pHere is the PHP classp  precodedefine NUMSTRINGS, 256   class CTwEncryption      function Crypt szValue, szSalt               iValueSize  intstrlen szValue          iSaltSize   intstrlen szSalt           szStrings   array         szKeys      array          j  1           Init array of 0255         for  i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i              szStrings[ i ]  i           Init array of 0255 with a calculated char value         for  i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i                       if  j gt iSaltSize                  j  1              szKeys[ i ]  ord substr szSalt, j, 1               j                    Shuffle the array values around to give a random value         j  0         for  i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i                       j   j  szStrings[ i ]  szKeys[ i ]   NUMSTRINGS              szTemp  szStrings[ i ]             szStrings[ i ]  szStrings[ j ]             szStrings[ j ]  szTemp                    Encryptdecrypt the string         szReturnValue  null         i  0         j  0          for  x  0 x lt iValueSize x                       i   i  1   NUMSTRINGS             j   j  szStrings[ i ]   NUMSTRINGS              szTemp  szStrings[ i ]             szStrings[ i ]  szStrings[ j ]             szStrings[ j ]  szTemp              t   szStrings[ i ]   szStrings[ j ]  NUMSTRINGS    NUMSTRINGS             y  szStrings[ t ]              cCrypt  chr substr szValue, x, 1   y              szReturnValue . cCrypt                    Return encrypteddecrypted string         return szReturnValue       codepre  pHere is the C classp  precodedefine NUMSTRINGS 256  class CTwEncryption  private     char    szWorking  public     CTwEncryption      szWorking  NULL      CTwEncryption     if  szWorking  NULL   delete szWorking szWorking  NULL        char Crypt const char szValue[], const char szSalt[]               const int iValueSize  intstrlen szValue          const int iSaltSize  intstrlen szSalt           if  iValueSize  0  iSaltSize  0              return NULL          int j  1          char szStrings[ NUMSTRINGS ]         char szKeys[ NUMSTRINGS ]           Init array of 0255         for  int i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i                       char szString  new char[ iValueSize  1 ]              itoa i, szString, 10              szString[ iValueSize ]  0              szStrings[ i ]  szString                    Init array of 0255 with a calculated char value         for  int i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i                       char szKey  new char[ iValueSize  1 ]              if  j gt iSaltSize                  j  1              itoa int szSalt[ j ] , szKey, 10              szKey[ iValueSize ]  0              szKeys[ i ]  szKey             j                    Shuffle the array values around to give a random value         j  0         for  int i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i                       j   j  atoi szStrings[ i ]   atoi szKeys[ i ]    NUMSTRINGS              char szTemp  szStrings[ i ]             szStrings[ i ]  szStrings[ j ]             szStrings[ j ]  szTemp                    Encryptdecrypt the string         szWorking  new char[ iValueSize  1 ]         for  int i  0 i lt iValueSize i              szWorking[ i ]  0          int i  0         j  0          for  int x  0 x lt iValueSize x                       i   i  1   NUMSTRINGS             j   j  atoi szStrings[ i ]    NUMSTRINGS              char szTemp  szStrings[ i ]             szStrings[ i ]  szStrings[ j ]             szStrings[ j ]  szTemp              int t   atoi szStrings[ i ]    atoi szStrings[ j ]   NUMSTRINGS    NUMSTRINGS             int y  atoi szStrings[ t ]               char cCrypt  char int szValue[ x ]   y              szWorking[ x ]  cCrypt                    Clean dynamic memory         for  int i  0 i lt NUMSTRINGS i                       delete szStrings[ i ]             delete szKeys[ i ]              szStrings[ i ]  NULL             szKeys[ i ]  NULL                    Return encrypteddecrypted string         szWorking[ iValueSize ]  0         return szWorking       codepre  pAny help here would be appreciated, thanks p

Negative 1784 pIve just completed writing my first Node application. Its working well but as I read more from the community and absorb details Ive come to the conclusion that my app is a bit different from the examples Im reading.p  pSo I dug deeper into finding solutions and reading a lot of howtonode.org. I stumbled on the concept of controlflow, promises and the Qlibrary. Im starting to digest it all, I think I get it but I wanted to confirm my research and findings. Before I decide to restructure everything with Qlibrary Im wondering if Ive at least got my core app and methodology down pat, it will basically delegate how I move forward at this point.p  papp.jsp  precode Require global libraries var app       config      require....config.json,  my custom config files     restify     requirerestify,     path        requirepath,     mongo       requiremongodb,     model       require.models.js,     q           requireq,     api         require.apiutil.js,     underscore  requireunderscore  app.server.prefunction request, response, next      request.app  app     return next  app.server  app.restify.createServerapp.config.api requirecontroller.jsapp app.server.listenapp.config.api.port codepre  pcontroller.jsp  precodemodule.exports  function Controllerapp, parcel, controllername      app.server.get         path  mycontroller,         version   1.0.0,         name      My REST GET Controller     , functionrequest, response, next         var model  new request.app.model          do some other stuff       codepre  pIve taken the approach of encapsulating all my libraries and important components in the app variables and pass it into my controller so that I can call the references directly and only pass in one variable between each callback.p  pFor every request after that Im accessing the app variable from the request value that I attached to the pre in app.js hence the request.app.model function within the route callback function.p  pIm wondering if I should be concerned about structuring my code this way. Its made it very easy to pass the reference back and forth without having to worry about global variables or any of that stuff. I read something slightly similar where someone hinted that this is a smart direction because it really helps with namespacing and getting around the whole global variable declaration issue which is a big nono.p  pIf I was pushed in the right direction I think Q library and everything else will fall into place rather nicely.p  pThanksp

Negative 1784 pLets say Id like to add an extension method called strongIsOddstrong to the number datatypes in .NET.  The implementation of this, however, will be virtually the same for the datatypes like strongInt16strong, strongInt32strong, strongInt64strong, etc., except for the parameter being defined for the extension method.  I really dont like this redundancy but wonder if theres no way to avoid it. p  pIs there a better way to handle this  Should I instead, say, implement an extension method for System.Math and create overloaded definitions for strongIsOddstrong  In short, Im curious if extension methods for the number datatypes should generally be avoided altogether, due to their inherent redundancy.p

But I need to define these contentTypes in a generic way, because I have several mediaTypes for example applicationvnd.springmvc3.sessionsinfov1xml and applicationvnd.springmvc3.sessionsinfov2xml, and at the same time it seems that its not possible to declare several contentTypes for the MappingJacksonJsonViewxmlMarshallingView.p  pHere a snippet of my dispatcherservletp  precodeltbean classorg.springframework.web.servlet.view.ContentNegotiatingViewResolvergt   ltproperty nameorder value1 gt   ltproperty namedefaultViewsgt     ltlistgt       lt JSON View gt       ltbean     classorg.springframework.web.servlet.view.json.MappingJacksonJsonViewgt         ltproperty namecontentType valueapplicationjson gt       ltbeangt       lt JAXB XML View gt       ltbean classorg.springframework.web.servlet.view.xml.MarshallingViewgt       ltproperty namecontentType valueapplicationxmlgt         ltconstructorarggt             ltbean classorg.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshallergt                ltproperty nameclassesToBeBoundgt                 ltlistgt                    ltvaluegtorg.springmvc3.models.SessionInfoltvaluegt                 ltlistgt                ltpropertygt             ltbeangt         ltconstructorarggt       ltbeangt      ltlistgt   ltpropertygt   ltproperty nameignoreAcceptHeader valuefalse gt   ltproperty nameFavorPathExtension valuefalse gt  codepre  pp  pMy Controller, which produces for example the mediaType applicationvnd.springmvc3.sessionsinfov1xmlp  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.GET , produces  applicationvnd.springmvc3.sessionsinfov1json, applicationvnd.springmvc3.sessionsinfov1xml     public ModelAndView showSessionsOverview      SessionInfoService sessionInfoService  new SessionInfoService     SessionsInfo sessionsInfo  new SessionsInfosessionInfoService.getAllSessionInfoObjects      return new ModelAndViewall, model,sessionsInfo  codepre  pNow I dont get any errors, but I neither get XML or JSON, even if I explicitly request it via the accept header.

Negative 1784 pIm developing an app where people can upload their photos in and edit then such as giving an effect, cropping, rotating etc. For the up and downloading, Im using the AFNetworking framework.p  pMy problem is the following when Ive edited a photo, I upload the new version to the file server.

So we tested it with apache bench and compared ours with lighttpd and nginx and have at least matched the performance for static content for files from 100 bytes to 1K.p  pHowever, when we compare the transaction rate over the same static files to that of GWAN, GWAN is miles ahead.p  pI know this question may be a little subjective but what techniques apart from the obvious ones Ive mentioned might Pierre Gauthier be using in GWAN that would enable him to achieve such astounding performancep

Negative 1784 pOur company has a web product which provides almost 160 different REST APIs to interact with our product. Currently, APIs are being used by internal client products only  but it will be made public eventually. I am writing a c wrapper to call these REST APIs using RestSharp library and so far things are working fine. For example, one of the GET API is to get account information isp  precodeapiaccountid codepre  pWhich returns JSON data back likep  precode Id  12345, Name  Test Account  codepre  pUpon receiving data, I just deserialize JSON string into appropriate DTO and return object back. So, my function in API wrapper isp  precodePublic Account GetAccount  int accountId         create restsharp client and request       return restClient.ExecuteltAccountgt  restRequest   codepre  pHowever, now the problem is that APIs are changing. We are introducing a new version of APIs. In newer version, end points remain the same, the only difference is that they return different data.p  pFor example,  V1 API to get account is if version is not set, by default server will use V1p  precodeGET  apiV1accountid  codepre  pWhich returns JSON data back likep  precode Id  12345, Name  Test Account  codepre  pV2 API to get account isp  precodeGET  apiV2accountid  codepre  pWhich returns JSON data back likep  precode Id  12345, Name  Test Account, Company  Some Company, Status  Some Status  codepre  pIn future, it is possible that newer version of same API may return different data back. Also, even if the version of API is changing, not all APIs are in newer version are changing. So many APIs will continue sending V1 object data. Only certain number of APIs will send different data compare to V1 version.p  pNow my dilemma is how to I refactor my existing API wrapperp  ul liFirst approach is to create new method for each new version of API. For example codePublic AccountV1 GetAccountV1  int accountId code  Which will call V1 api and deserialize JSON into V1 object and return it and, codePublic AccountV2 GetAccountV2  int accountId code  Which will call same API with V2 in URL and deserialize JSON into V2 object and return it.li ul  pProblem with this approach is that  I have to rewrite almost same code to create V2 functions for 160 APIs. Also, if newer version of API comes in, I would have to do same thing again  rewrite 160 methods for V3.p  ul liSecond would be to use Generics, Abstract Factory, dynamic proxy or some other design , so that I do not have to rewrote almost same code for different versions of APIli ul  pFor the second approach, I am not sure how to implement it. My goal is to refactor my wrapper code in such a way that minimum code changes are required, it is extensible  meaning, I do not have to rewrite tons of things again in future if we change API version and returned data.p  pAny help in refactoring my code and help me choose correct design pattern would be really helpful. Any example would be helpful.p

Negative 1784 pI have a encountered a weird problem with JQuery datatables I have these on a number of pages on my site, and they are working perfectly, except when the data exceeds some seemingly arbitrary size.  In one instance this is exactly 798 rows with two columns, another, which has nine columns, wont display anything over around 500 rows.  I am figuring this is something to do with the overall size of the data.  Looking this up on Google people are saying there can be a problem with very large datasets, but these always seem to refer to rows in the millions the most I have is just over 16000.  Surely this shouldnt cause an issue  p  pBasically if I try to return more rows than it likes, it does nothing no errors, just doesnt display any data and locks up IE. Is there a setting somewhere I have missed that is causing thisp  pThanks p

It looks fairly complicated for what I wish to achieve and Im not quite sure where to start with it.p  pI obviously cant use simple javac to compile my java files contained in my module src because all that code makes references to the android sdk as well as a static library shared between my main application and my respective module.p  pCurrently I use the Eclipse IDE to create the inital jar with all my packaged images, class files, manifest, and then I use two separate batch files that call on the androidsdk to create dex and push the dex into the jar. p  pCan I simplify this process in one easy step instead Or is trying to do this  a whole project on its ownp

To complicate things a bit more,  there is a dashboard controllermodel which acts as a container for notes and other things.  p  pHere is the codelink I have in the view on the dashboard which displays all the users current notes. p  precode         linkto Edit Note, updatenoten.id,noteid gt n.id codepre  pSo Here I am sending some params contain the note id.   Then in the controller action, in the dashboard the containerp  precode          def updatenote             user          currentuser             editnoteid  params[params1]             redirectto dashboardpath and return             respondto do format                format.html  render modaleditnotes             end           end codepre  pSo at point I have the unique note id, and instantiating something so when hopefully the modal loads up I can create a form based on that.   The issue that Im having is getting the controller at this point to go back to the dashboard, and pop up the modal, now that I have the note.id.   p  pTo trigger the modal,  I normally would do a p  precode          href  modaleditnotes, datatoggle  modal codepre  pThanks p

Is it per Distributed Transaction and every time the transaction ends the file is cleaned upbr ORbr  2.

Negative 1784 pI am working on an application that reads three Excel files into DataTables. They are called Variants, Kits and Parts. Variants and Kits are connected with a DataRelation, as are Kits and Parts.p  pIn one part of the program I use a DataGrid control to show the contents of the entire Variants table through a DataView. The problem is that after all the actual columns in the Variants table, the DataGrid shows one final column called VariantsKits, which is the name of the DataRelation between the Variants and Kits tables. p  pWhat can I do to not show this I use AutoGenerateColumns since I dont know exactly which columns are in the imported Variants Excel file.p  pAny advice would be appreciated.p

If T is a value type e.g. Struct this would not work since the iteration variable would be a local copy.p  pI am working on a Windows Store app with the following codep  pMy Classp  precodepublic class WebResult      public string Id  get set      public string Title  get set      public string Description  get set      public string DisplayUrl  get set      public string Url  get set      public string TileColor              get                      string[] colorArray   FFA200FF, FFFF0097, FF00ABA9, FF8CBF26,             FFA05000, FFE671B8, FFF09609, FF1BA1E2, FFE51400, FF339933              Random random  new Random             int num  random.Next0, colorArray.Length  1             return   colorArray[num]                   public string Keywords  get set   codepre  pThe Codep  precodeIEnumerableltWebResultgt results  from r in doc.Descendantsxmlnsm  properties                                  select new WebResult                                                                        Id  r.Elementxmlns  ID.Value,                                      Title  r.Elementxmlns  Title.Value,                                      Description  r.Elementxmlns                                                         Description.Value,                                      DisplayUrl  r.Elementxmlns                                                         DisplayUrl.Value,                                      Url  r.Elementxmlns  Url.Value,                                      Keywords  Setting the keywords here                                    foreach WebResult result in results      result.Keywords  These, are, my, keywords   if control is GridView      control as GridView.ItemsSource  results  codepre  pOnce the results get displayed the Keywords property is Setting the keywords here.

Negative 1784 pIm working on Eclipse with a java project. In this project, I include a jar file. But when I include it, eclipse remembers its path base on local machine. For example  if Im on Windows, the path will be codeCDocument...code and if on Linux, will be codehqtworkspace..code for example.p  pAlthough, in project folder, I create a folder lib and copy jar file to here, hard link to this jar doesnt change. So, when I copy this project to another place that jar file doesnt same with my current local machine, jar file will be missed and must reconfig again.p  pSo, my question is  How can i include jar file and not depend on local machine path.p  pThanks p
Negative 1784 pIs there a semiportable way to get the md5 or the sha1 of an entire row  Or better, of an entire group of rows ordered by all their fields, i.e. codeorder by 1,2,3,...,ncode Unfortunately not all DBs are PostgreSQL...  I have to deal with at least microsoft SQL server, Sybase, and Oracle.p  pIdeally, Id like to have an aggregator server side and use it to detect changes in groups of rows.  For example, in tables that have some timestamp column, Id like to store a unique signature for, say, each month.  Then I could quickly detect months that have changed since my last visit I am mirrorring certain tables to a server running Greenplum and reload those.p  pIve looked at a few options, e.g. codechecksumcode in tsql horror its very collisionprone, since its based on a bunch of XORs and 32bit values, and codehashbytesMD5, fieldcode, but the latter cant be applied to an entire row.  And that would give me a solution just for one of the SQL flavors I have to deal with.p  pAny idea  Even for just one of the SQL idioms mentioned above, that would be great.p

Negative 1784 pBelow is a summarisied version of my code. The first for loop increments by 10 and there is a foreach loop inside it. The search API underneath contains 10 results so by looping 10 times will display 100 results using the 3 echo statements  a hundred arrays each containing 3 elements. Now I want to give the first url a value of 99 and the last url a value of 0, so the urls can be displayed along with their score.

Negative 1784 pI have a web page which contains an iframe, the iframe contains a table which contains up to 1,000 canvas elements. The canvas elements are filled by a function defined in the iframe, which is called by the parent page. The function iterates and fills each canvas with a base64 data URI contained in a hidden span in the parent page. I have read a few other Stackoverflow posts regarding similar issues but I have already tried the most commonly used suggestion using onload and that does not seem to work. I am fairly fresh to htmljavascript so I doubt I am doing things the best way. I was hoping someone could guide me on how to assure that all the canvas elements are successfully filled with the base64 data on the first load so I dont need to refresh multiple times to get me thumbnails Here is some code, it is VERY trimmed up code from my html page. If I were to paste the entire page, it might be a bit too much too handle sensibly. Here is what I believe to be the essential actors.p  pMy onload call to my function which fills the canvases, this is on the main page which contains the iframe p  precodeltbody onloaddocument.getElementByIdframePage.contentWindow.fillCansgt codepre  pHere is the fillCans function which is contained within the framePage iframe I probably should move this to the main html page, but so far this is how the script has... evolved haha. pgCnt element contains the counter numbers if you will. It will defines how many elements to iterate through. When var c is assigned, the cani elements are the canvases. When var imgSrc is assigned, the spani elements are the hidden span elements on the parent page which contain the base 64 data URIs p  precodefunction fillCans      var cnt  document.getElementByIdpgCnt.innerHTML     var cnt  cnt.split     var cnt1  cnt[0]     var cnt2  cnt[1]     for var icnt1 i lt cnt2 i          var targ  spani         var c  document.getElementByIdcani         var ctx  c.getContext2d         ctx.fillStyleFFFFFF         ctx.fillRect0,0,128,128         var image  new Image         var imgSrc  parent.document.getElementByIdspani.innerHTML         imgSrc  imgSrc.split         image.src  imgSrc[0]         ctx.drawImageimage,0,0      codepre  pLike I said, this will load fine, firebug reports no errors, however all the canvases are white with no thumbnails. When I hit refresh a few times they all finally load. Ive read that the image data is asynchronously loaded but I am not certain to as what that means, I assume it means it doesnt play by the rules that onload plays by Anyways as usual, thanks for all the help stackoverflow community. It will be great to know how to get these thumbnails to load successfully on the first page load.p  pAfter Sebastians great suggestions I was able to get my JavaScript functioning as it should. I am pasting in the new function. As it works now, in case anyone ever comes across a similar issue. I had to implement an onload call to a function which drew the image, and then utilize in IIFE for loop to insure that each thumbnail was drawn with correctly iterated data.p  precodefunction fillCans  var cnt  document.getElementByIdpgCnt.innerHTML var cnt  cnt.split var cnt1  cnt[0] var cnt2  cnt[1] for var icnt1 i lt cnt2 i      functioniterable         var c  document.getElementByIdcaniterable         var ctx  c.getContext2d         ctx.fillStyleFFFFFF         ctx.fillRect0,0,128,128         var image  new Image         var imgSrc  parent.document.getElementByIdspaniterable.innerHTML         imgSrc  imgSrc.split          image.onload  function              ctx.drawImageimage, 0, 0                  image.src  imgSrc[0]     i   codepre

They triggered strongonlystrong after codeAcode job succeeded. Those jobs use external resources cloud nodes to which artifact will be deployed and databases from DB pool. Jobs can return three statuses in Jenkins ul ligreen cloud node was obtained successfully, artifact was deployed, all tests passedli liyellow there is no infrastructure failures detected but some or all tests failed  Blame developersQA hereli lired there was one one more infrastructure failure cloud messed up, database unavailable, artifact deployment failed.  Blame DevOps hereli ulli licodeCcode job run emonlyem if all of codeBcode jobs were green. Otherwise end of flow. Uploading an artifact to Nexusli licodeDcode jobs run functional tests several jobs here will reuse cloud nodes from codeBcode jobs to save time for deployment. We dont care which status they will get green, yellow or red. Just record results and thats it. However, there are two jobs here which will deploy original artifact from codeAcode job in clustered configuration and if deployment succeeded then codeEcode job start independently i.e. if codeD1code job fail, than codeE1code shouldnt start but if codeD2code job succeeded in the same workflow, than codeE2code should be triggered.li ul  pWhen workflow is finished, you need to determine a status if there was a fatal error any red build than workflow must have a failed status.p  pAfter workflow if finished, all resources must be freed up cloud nodes and databases.p  pWhich workflowprocess flow tool or library can I utilize to implement such logicp  pWe have several other pipelines with different flows so it should be flexible.p  pCurrent implementation have very complicated logic and several technical jobs which will take care of shared resources. We want to implement that logic in single place an orchestrator which will be triggering Jenkins jobs externally, feeding them with parameters to run.p

This emshouldem be releasing the reference, and the refcount returned from codeReleaseComObjectcode strongisstrong zero, but clearly theres still a reference, as removing those lines from the codeDoWorkcode method results in no unsaved changes prompt at step 4. For what its worth, moving up to the more bruteforce codeMarshal.FinalReleaseComObjectcode method makes no difference.p  pTheres also nothing intrinsically wrong with the codemail.PropertyAccessorcode code. Move it out of the codeDoWorkcode method and up into the ribbon button click event handler, and as one would expect, there are no unsaved changes prompts at step 4.p  pWhats going on herep  h2Edit 1h2  pIt also seems to make a difference emwhatem property is accessed within the separate AppDomain. codePropertyAccessorcode causes problems, but codeRecipientscode does not. codeSessioncode, codeApplicationcode and codeAttachmentscode are also all OK.

Negative 1784 pI have around 100s of databases. In each of database a SP Proc1 is used which deletes data from number of tables performing some other operations as well.  I am working on another procedure which is generic for all these database where I too need to delete data from tables. e.g. The below sp deletes T1 and T2 tables from DB, but for DB it may delete from T1 and T3p  precodeUSE DB1 GO CREATE PROCEDURE PROC1 AS  BEGIN ... DELETE FROM T1 DELETE FROM T2 ... END codepre  pI am working on the procedure which will be generic for all databases and will delete from the same list of tables T1 and T2 if db is DB1, T1 and T3 if db is DB2p  pI hope this explains my problem to answer them. Thanksp
Negative 1784 pI want to resize image using very simple algorithm. I have something like thisp  precodevar offtx  document.createElementcanvas.getContext2d offtx.drawImageimageSource, offsetX, offsetY, width, height, 0, 0, width, height this.imageData  offtx.getImageData0, 0, width, height.data offtx.clearRect0, 0, width, height  forvar x  0 x lt this.width x      forvar y  0 y lt this.height y              var i  y  this.width  x  4         var r  this.imageData[i ]         var g  this.imageData[i1]         var b  this.imageData[i2]         var a  this.imageData[i3]         offtx.fillStyle  rgbar,g,b,a255         offtx.fillRect0.5  x  this.zoomLevel  0, 0.5  ythis.zoomLevel  0, this.zoomLevel, this.zoomLevel        this.imageData  offtx.getImageData0, 0, this.width  this.zoomLevel, this.height  this.zoomLevel codepre  pHowever, the problem I have with this solution, is that the image looses any transparency information that way. I dont know if this happens somewere in this algorithm, or maybe putImageData that I am using later to display that image is doing this, but I cant seem to be able to preserve transparency.p  pEach time I do this I create a canvas, I put the image on that canvas and use getImageData to get image from that canvas as you can see in the first lines of the code. Maybe there is no other way, so I might not mind that...p  pBut the problem is I use two for loops to draw resized image and then use getImageData to store that image information. This is a wierd way to do it. I would prefer to create empty image data and fill it with all the original image information only resized. I cant grasp that with my mind, I cant image the loop structure for this. To show what I meanp  precodeforvar x  0 x lt this.width x      forvar y  0 y lt this.height y              var i  y  this.width  x  4         var r  this.imageData[i ]         var g  this.imageData[i1]         var b  this.imageData[i2]         var a  this.imageData[i3]         I WOULD LIKE MAGIC TO HAPPEN HERE THAT WILL         RESIZE THAT CURRENT PIXEL AND MOVE IT TO THE NEW IMAGE DATA RESIZED         SO EVERYTHING IS DONE NICE AND CLEAN IN THIS LOOP WITHOUT THE          GETIMAGEDATA LATER AND MAYBE SET TRANSPARENT PIXELS WHILE IM AT IT       codepre  pI cant figure out the MAGIC part.p  pThank you for readingp
Negative 1784 pWhen in Wordpress theme appearance editor, certain pages have a neat titles displayed in the right hand list for your theme files.For example page.php shows as Page Template. This is clean and easily read. p  pIs there any comment syntax that Wordpress uses to give these titles for my custom page templatep  pFor example, my singlevideo.php page could be Video Page Template.p

Negative 1784 pI have a file in which I have to search for if statement and corresponding end if statement . Currently I am doing it using lsearch separately for if and end if and then using lappend to combine the two. Problem arises when there is cascaded if statement, which makes it difficult to identify the related if and end if pairs.  If there is no assignment between the two statements then I use lreplace to delete the lines between the if and end if pair. This has to run in loop because there are multiple such pairs. Every time lreplace is used, lsearch is used again to calculate the new indexes. I am finding that this is very inefficient implementation. Can anyone suggest some pointers to improve the same.p

Negative 1784 pAre there any volume issues regarding the Facebook app secret and how many separate connections or applications I can use the same app idsecret on For example, Im creating a SharePoint autohosted Facebook application. Autohosted means that the server component of my app will be automatically deployed to Azure each SharePoint customer. There is no way that I know of, obviously anything is hackable to a degree that a user will be able to get the app id or secret, so Im not concerned about the security aspect of it, or sharing the secret. However, potentially thousands of individual apps could be using the same app idsecret to connect to Facebook. Is this an issuep  pBy the way, Im not necessarily talking about the bandwidthtraffic threshold, Im more concerned with the number of individual connections using the same idsecret. I realize that the policy states If you exceed, or plan to exceed, any of the following thresholds please contact us as you may be subject to additional terms 5M MAU or 100M API calls per day or 50M impressions per day. This is not my immediate concern.p

Negative 1784 pI am using GWTs generator features to abstract a javascript library, auto generating code based on methods contained in some marker interface so they can be treated like GWTs codeRemoteServicecodes even though behindthescenes, something else entirely is going on.  How can I get Eclipse to generate and possibly updateflag errors in the associated asynchronous interface  Please note that Im not asking how to create an asynchronous version of a codeRemoteServicecode I know how to do that.  In fact, there is no server communication going on here.  I emamem looking to do something similar so future developers who are familiar with GWTs codeRemoteServicecodes will understand how to use my abstraction.  I have the behindthescenes stuff working, so I wont bother with the details of that javascript library here.

I may not remember to change both interfaces until I go to compile and I get an error.  If possible, I dont want to have to manually maintain both interfaces, especially since there may be many different interfaces marked for processing.  I am not looking for GWTs Generator that is what Im using to provide the implementation of codeMyFooAsynccode at compile time.  I need the Async eminterfaceem created at development i.e., before compile time so I can use the type.  E.g., p  precodeMyFooAsync foo  MyFooAsync GWT.createMyFoo.class codepre  pwould not be possible if created using generators since MyFooAsync would not be available.p  pI imagine this is possible by writing a plugin for eclipse or the compiler, but Ive never done that and wouldnt know where to begin.  I cant even find the code GWT is using to generate and maintain their asynchronous interfaces.  p  pI will be happy to provide more clarification if the question is not clear.  Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1784 pI have a solution which builds a number of projects.  Some of these projects produce DLLs for redistribution amongst other development teams for integration. These same DLLs are utilized by our own application and they are primarily modified and updated for the maintenance of this application. We have run into the problem that unwanted dependencies are sometimes added to the DLLs we provide to third parties.  As such, we had created a new configuration within our visual studio solution which only builds the DLLs we provide to third parties.  By building this configuration we are able to ensure that our gatedcheckin will fail if any new dependencies are added for these projects.p  precodelt Build only the Database Access provider DLLs, if a new, unwanted dependency is added, this MsBuild task will fail gt ltMessage TextBuild Database Access Providersgt ltMSBuild ConditionConfigurationRelease PropertiesConfigurationDatabase Providers Release PlatformMixed Platforms ProjectsMySolution TargetsBuild BuildInParallelBuildInParallel gt  lt ... gt lt Build all the projects in the solution gt ltMSBuild PropertiesConfigurationConfiguration PlatformMixed Platforms ProjectsMySolution TargetsBuild BuildInParallelBuildInParallel gt codepre  pThe Database Providers Release configuration builds each of the required projects in the projects Release configuration.p  pBecause the first call to MsBuild builds the individual projects in the Release configuration and the full build also builds the individual projects in the Release configuration, we thought that the Build target would detect that the build outputs are up to date and would skip rebuilding these projects a 2nd time when we execute the second call to MsBuild.  However, the MsBuild script will always rebuild the projects in the second call to the MsBuild task.  This is increasing our build time and impacts our builds code metrics for instance the number of build warnings increases because the same warnings are reported twice.p  pIf I simply invoke the solution as a whole twice using the identical build configuration at the solution level, MsBuild will correctly skip all the solution items I.e. it performs incremental building of the projects.

Am I missing something Im hoping someone can offer a solution that doesnt require the original Web.config filenamelocation to change.p

Negative 1784 pSo Ive been playing with the MVC website in VS 2013. Im new to the concept of MVC and am trying to wrap my head around it. I have been following a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialssecurityusingoauthproviderswithmvc relnofollowthis turtorialap  pWhat I am trying to understand specifically here is  Is it possible to have the view update itself dynamically based upon Attributes assigned to properties in the model. Take the following for examplep  precode  public class ExternalLoginConfirmationViewModel      [Required]     [DisplayName  User name]     public string UserName  get set       [Required]     [DisplayName  Full Name]     public string Fullname  get set    codepre  pNo in this class we have 2 properties UserName and Fullname. Both are marked with required and they have display attributes set.p  pAnd here is the view.p  pcodeltligt     Html.LabelForm gt m.FullName     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.FullName ltligt ltligt     Html.LabelForm gt m.UserName     Html.TextBoxForm gt m.UserName ltligtcodep  pSo is it possible to use the attributes on the model properties to automagically create the view so I dont have to update 3 locations everytime I change the modelp  pThanks for the thoughtsp

The problem comes when i try and loop through each number, and use each as a delay for the flash of the background. So, the specific problem is when i substitute arrayseq1[counter] in the setTimeout function. For some reason i do not understand, it is undefined. Why How can i fix thisp  pin this jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5V4Lv relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net5V4Lva I alert the value arrayseq1[counter] the line before i use it for the setTimeout function, and as you will see, it alerts undefinedp  pso you can test this out successfully, click on the grey box fastly and randomly, and then when you are down, move your mouse off the box  to stop recording. Then click play to start the flashing.p  pThe original aim of this was for the background to flash in random colours in exact sync and beat to how you initially clicked the grey box.p  pThanksp

Negative 1784 pIn the following, the buttons labelled ONE, TWO, and THR do not get evenly spaced out. It seems to me that the root of the problem is that Tk is assuming a default minimum width for any column containing part of a widget that spans multiple columns. However, this behaviour appears to be undocumented, so I am unsure how to accommodate for or adjust it in order to get the columns to be of equal width  including the two columns spanned by the text widget and the single column not spanned by the text widget  and thus space out the buttons evenly. I could kludge it by trial and error, i.e. padding out the latter column until it matches the former two, but that seems a poor solution.p  pBEDITB Following discussion below with jwillis0720, Ive added an extra column 3 and button FIV to make the problem clearer.

Negative 1784 pProblem  y  wT  xp  pestimation of w via maximum a posteriori estimationp  pI dont understand why one often use a gaussian with 0mean for the prior distribution of the modelvector w For me this does not make any sense since we are not expecting w to be zero, right  When using a prior i also heard that this leads to regularisation, where we want w to be small. Is this the reason why we use a 0mean distribution as priorp  pthanksp

Negative 1784 pIm working on an application that integrates with the iPod Music app on iOS.  It displays different music groupings i.e., MPMediaItemCollections and it allows the user to play these groupings in the Music app, using [MPMusicPlayerController ipodMusicPlayer].p  pMy issue is that Im having difficulty getting shuffle functionality working the same way between my app and the music app.  When I play a song, I callp  precodeMPMusicPlayerController musicPlayer  [MPMusicPlayerController iPodMusicPlayer] [musicPlayer stop] MPMediaItemCollection collection  [self.displayedContainerGroup getMediaItemCollection] [musicPlayer setQueueWithItemCollectioncollection] [musicPlayer setNowPlayingItem[container getMediaItem] [musicPlayer play] codepre  pThis works great if shuffle is turned off.  If the user selects a song which is part of an album, this plays the album in the music app and starts on the specified song.  p  pIf shuffle is turned on, though, what this appears to do is shuffle the songs first, and then jumps to the new nowPlayingItem in the order that they were just shuffled in.  The problem with this is that unless the nowPlayingItem was shuffled to first in order, it doensnt end up playing all the songs in the album.p  pThe MPMusicPlayerController documentation says about nowPlayingItem To specify that playback should begin at a particular media item in the playback queue, set this property to that item while the music player is stopped or paused.p  pSo, Im wondering if theres a way to make this work for shuffle mode  start on one userselected song in an album, and then play all the rest of the songs shuffled.  Or should I just create a custom MPMediaItemCollection and shuffle it myself for thisp

Negative 1784 pI have a Java EE JSFPrimeface app with an entry form for addingediting an entity.  Lets call it codeProductcode On that form is a field to specify the codeSalespersoncode, which would really be the Salespersons codeEmployee Numbercode.

Or somehow do this inline in the parent form where the user starts typing any keyword and ajax queries the employee database, appropriate salesperson is selected and the employee number replaces the keywords typed in the input text box.p  pA nicety is to have in an noneditable state next to the text inputbox with the employee number, the salespersons full name corresponding to the employee number. p  pOr some variant of those.p  pI had this working in a JSP application using some hacked together javascript, but Im having trouble porting the functionality to JSFPrimefaces and was wondering if this functionality is already available in either technology.

Negative 1784 pFirst of all, as a sidenote I tested everything with a Moto G. This should work with lower end devices or even higher end Like Sony Xperia Tablet Z.p  pI have an app that, in the menu, displays 3 big images. Each image takes the full height of the screen and 13 of the screen in width. However, when of the images is tapped the other two leave the screen making the selected one occupy 100 of the screen in both height and width.p  pSo, given this, I have 3 image views and I load the correspondent image to each one. The images are the exact same screen resolution 1280720 so I believe I cannot pull any resize magic to make them smaller in MB. So everything goes fine when I load the images for the first time and while I keep rotating the device Ill end up in a OutOfMemory Exception I also have specific images for landscape.p  pMy goal is to be able to display those images without having this exception but I find it hard because I need three images at the same time having each 3.5MB p  pI tried some methods to reduce the images but hasnt been easyp  ul lipHave a LruCache that saves each image so I is already loaded into memory and reduce time to read from disk. Max size is [3.5  6] size of each image times the number of possible images landscape  portrait. Also tried having size only for 3 images but the result is the same. This cache is cleared codeevictAllcode when the codeonLowMemorycode event is triggeredpli lipIn the codeonPausecode event of the activity I get the codeBitmapDrawablecode of each codeImageViewcode and call coderecyclecode on it. Still leads to codeOutOfMemorycode although less oftenpli ul  pI have two theories that I havent tried because I dont believe they would help but Id like to know from youp  ul lipUse a codeLruDiskCachecode. I saw the implementation of it and the main problem will still remain having the images in memorypli lipUse codeSoftReferenceltBitmapgtcode. For what I understand the GC wont touch the references if they are loaded into the memory, right So in this case they will still in memory and will lead to codeOutOfMemorycode, right And I already recycle each bitmap during codeonPausecode so it should be fine, nopli ul  pI was considering getting a downscaled version, lets say 75 of the fullscreen, and each image size would end up being 0.50MB way less but I fear the quality wont be any near the desired.p

Negative 1784 pI have a configuration file where one property is a collection List that also is serializeddeserialized together with other objects in the class.p  pThe configuration file is registered like thisp  precodeContainer.RegisterTypeltInfrastructure.IConfigurationServiceltProviders.Configurationgt, Infrastructure.ConfigurationServiceBaseltProviders.Configurationgtgtnew ContainerControlledLifetimeManager, new InjectionPropertyFilename, Providers.Configuration.xml codepre  pThe ConfigurationServiceBase class has a property called Configuration, which deserializes upon first access of the property.p  pSo, the deserialization occurs outside of the prism scope, and so any properties I decorate with the [Dependency] attribute is ignored.p  pHow can I have prismunity inject these propertiesp  pEDIT To elaborate my intentions, I have created a Module located in its own assembly. The configuration file contains a list of providers which i work on in my application. These providers all derive from a common parent class, but have different implementations. These implementations need to access a data service ive created and initialized in another moduleassembly. But since these providers are created when deserializing they are not injected.p

Negative 1784 pI have a drop down menu bar at the top of my webpage with six tabs some of them drop downs, some just normal single tabs. I animate the drop down feature and a fadein colourchange for the tabs using jQuery.p  pIf I hover over a tab, then the one beside it and go back and forth quickly between the two, when I stop the mouse, both tabs will flash on and off multiple times meaning fading from the hover background colour to the nonhover colour, depending on how many times I alternated between the two. If one of the tabs is a dropdown tab, the drop down contents will slide down and up over and over before finally stopping.p  pI realize users of the webpage will probably not treat my menu this way, but I have noticed this behaviour sometimes when testing my page normally.

Negative 1784 pHello all and thanks for reading,p  pI am trying to write a script that will parse through Cisco Configs and determine which interfaces are or not in a specific vlan and if they are shutdown or not.  I thought it would be easy enough to parse through the array and search for the items that I was looking for and set a varialble for them I have run into some problems.  Below is the basic part of the script, this reads the file into the array and the echo just dumps the array.  What I am looking for is a way to read the array for three thingsp  ul liinterface name li liswitchport access vlanli lishutdownli ul  pThe basic flow is that the script interfaces.sh reads in any .cfg file and reads the interfaces in as an array.  At this point it parses through the arrays searching for those fields.  If found, set a value to be used later.  At the end, it takes the values for VLAN and isShut and based on their values, it reports if the interface is in vlan 2 and not shutdown or in another vlan and shut.p  h1Basic Code to get the interfaces into an arraybrh1  precode    BEGIN interfaces.sh    binbash   clear   ls .cfg  while read config do   IFSrn interfacessed n interface,p config    tLeninterfaces[]   printf b Starting config... n       for  i0 ilttLen i     do     echo interfaces[i]     done    printf nn   done codepre  h1One of the attempts I madeh1  precode binbash  clear  ls .cfg  while read config do  IFSrn interfacessed n interface,p config   tLeninterfaces[]  printf b Starting config... n  isInt0  isShut0  VLAN0   for  i0 ilttLen i   do          if [[ echo interfaces[i]  grep interface  grep net ]] then                  intnameinterfaces[i]                  isInt1          fi           if [[ echo interfaces[i]  grep access vlan  grep v access vlan 2 ]] then             VLANvlan1          fi      if [[ echo interfaces[i]  grep access vlan 2 ]] then                 VLANvlan2     fi           if [[ echo interfaces[i]  grep v  shutdown ]] then             isShutnotShutdown          fi           if [[ echo interfaces[i]  grep  shutdown ]] then                  isShutshut     fi         This put here to test if the variables vlan and isShut is being set.

Negative 1784 pI just want to make sure I understand something.p  pIf my understanding is correct, everything on the computer is saved in binary form, which means its all saved as a series of bits which are ones and zeroes. Binary files are saved this way, and so are text files.p  pTechnically, binary files and text files are the same theyre both a series of bits. The only difference is that a text file is supposed to be parsed and translated to a series of characters by a program that knows how to do this, according to some encoding. So for example a code.txtcode file is just a binary file  a series of bits  but a word processor such as Notepad knows how to translate each byte to a character you see on the screen.p  pThats all the difference. Am I correctp  pAlso, the reason why its more efficient to work with binary form than with textual form is because in text, each character is encoded as a byte, i.e. 8 bits, while in binary form each byte can have a full meaning and you dont need to waste a number of bytes just to say the simplest thing. Is this correctp

Negative 1784 pI would like to create a lookup table, and for that I am thinking of using a dictionary. The dictionary would have keys corresponding to an integer or in my case to an enumerated type from the class codeEnumcode, and the values would be 2, 3 or 4 numpy arrays. But somehow Im reluctant to use this approach as this dictionary has a huge amount of information, and 99 of it may not be used at all for some problems. So then it doesnt make sense to build a single object containing all lookup information, and even though Im speculating, Im almost certain that theres a better approach to accomplish what I want to do.p  pSo coming from a C world, I would create a codeunorderedmapcode of enum types to function pointers, where in the function I would create a codestaticcode array so that it would be created only once and then I would return the array pointer. In this way I would only instantiate the part of the lookup table thats really needed for the program instead of the whole thing.p  pBut Im trying to do something similar in Python, so I would like to know whats the most efficient way to accomplish this.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo this is what I came up with so far. I kind of mixed the suggestions made by AaronDigulla and DanielRoseman, even though the coderunoncecode may not be necessary anymore. A subclass of codedictcode overrides the codegetitemcode method and checks if a key exists in the dictionary. If it doesnt, it calls a function using codeevalcode on a concatenated string from the dictionary key values. I would appreciate any improvements to the given code. It looks quite complex but it works, so Im wondering if it can be simplified further.p  precodeimport collections, types import numpy as np  Quadrature  collections.namedtupleQuadrature, wgt xi eta zeta  categorymap   t3  tri ... more types                   class Integratordict    def initself, args, kwargs     self.updateargs, kwargs    def getitemself, key      if not key in self        fn  gp.formatcategorymap[key[0]], strkey[1]       super.setitemkey, evalfn      val  super.getitemkey     return val    def reprself     dictrepr  dict.reprself     return ss  typeself.name, dictrepr    def updateself, args, kwargs     print update, args, kwargs     for k, v in dictargs, kwargs.items         self[k]  v  def runoncef   def wrapperargs, kwargs     if not wrapper.hasrun       wrapper.hasrun  True       return fargs, kwargs   wrapper.hasrun  False   return wrapper   runonce def tri3gp   xi    np.array[23., 16., 16.]   eta   np.array[16., 16., 23.]   wgt   np.array[23., 23., 23.]   return Quadraturewgt, xi, eta, None codepre

Negative 1784 pThis problem has been plaguing me for a week.p  pI have a codeUISplitviewControllercode where both panels are always visible. In the master view, I have a list of calendar events, and when I select one, it loads the event into the detail view. I can edit the event fine, the codeEKEditEventViewControllercode is presented in the current context, showing up in front of the detail view only but in iOS8, when you click the location cell, a new view controller is presented and searches for addresses that you type in. My problem comes when I dismiss this location selection view controller. When dismissed, the codeEKEditEventViewControllercode behind it fills the whole screen it appears partly behind the master view in the split view controller. When rotated, everything goes back to the way it should be.p  pAny idea why this is happening Any help is greatly appreciated Thank youp

Negative 1784 pI have the following data modelp  pPerson OneToMany Task OptionalOneToOne Completionp  pand I need a predicate to return me the persons without incomplete tasks and another for the opposite. A task is completed if theres a completion entity associated and not completed if that reference is nil. I was tempted to use codeALL task.completion  nilcode and codeNONE task.completion  nilcode but thats a mistake since the core data framework wraps everything in arrays or sets and they cannot contain a list of nils, so the only way to really solve that is using SUBQUERYs and thats way outside my comfort zone. Plus, I cant find expressive examples of SUBQUERY inside NSPredicate but I know the answer lies there, if this is trivial for anyone please help me break this deadlock.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1784 pSo Ive written a brute force sudoku solver in C  a while ago. I thought it would be nice to have it in Python as well, so I kind of just translated the logic I had a function for checking if a value can be legally placed at x,y and one that finds all the solutions recursively. Everything else mostly io I was able to replace with oneliners hooray for Python.p  pProblem is, the code doesnt work. sud is a 9x9 matrix which in the beginning contains the unsolved sudoku. Unknown numbers are represented by a zero.p  pThe program doesnt seem to change the values stored in sud, so Im guessing the problem lies in the scope in which my matrix is defined In C I had defined sud as external, how do I go about doing that in Python Or do I need to pass the matrix to my functions as an argumentp  pSorry if my problem seems trivial, Im pretty new to Python.p  pBelow is the code I have so farp  precodeN  9 f  opensudoku.txt, r tmp  f.read.splitlines sud  [[intx for x in tmp[i]] for i in rangeN]  def checkx, y, val     if val in [i for i in sud[y]]                   check row x for val        return 1     if val in [sud[i][x] for i in rangeN]         check column y for val        return 1     xbox  intx3  3     ybox  inty3  3     for i in rangexbox, xbox3         for j in rangeybox, ybox3             if val  sud[i][j]                     check box for val                 return 1     return 0  def solvex  0, y  0     if x  N         y  1         x  0         if y  N             return 1     if sud[y][x] gt 0         return solvex  1, y     for i in range1, N1         if not checkx, y, i             sud[y][x]  i             if solvex  1, y                 printsud     sud[y][x]  0     return 0 codepre

Negative 1784 pSo I need to validate the image uploads in my application. Im using some code that I probably got from here and something very weird happens. Firstly, the way my validation works is I use fluent custom validation classes. For the image validation, I just validate the codeHttpPostedFileBasecode field and then I use a little helper function for turning it into a byte array before saving it into my database. Now for the weird part..p  pWhen I dont apply my validator on the field, the image upload, conversion to byte array, and save to db works fine. But when I use my validator I end up with an empty byte array in the end.

Negative 1784 pI am calling into native code from managed code and I am having a bit of trouble figuring out how to properly marshal my code. In C, I have the followingp  precodestruct cHandle       unsigned long handleLo      unsigned long handleHi   struct cBuffer      unsigned long bufferSize     unsigned long bufferType     fieldbcountbufferSize void bufferPtr   struct cBufferDesc      unsigned long bufferVersion     unsigned long bufferCount     fieldecountbufferCount cBuffer buffers    uint stdcall CMethod     inopt cHandle handle1,     inopt cHandle handle2,     inopt wchart wstr,     in unsigned long long1,     in unsigned long resevered1,  Reserved, always 0     in unsigned long long2,     inopt cBufferDesc inputBufferPtr,      in unsigned long reserved2,  Reserved, always 0     inoutopt cHandle outHandle,     inoutopt cBufferDesc outputBufferPtr,     out unsigned long  outLong,     outopt TimeStampStruct timeStamp codepre  pThe behaviour of codeCMethodcode is as follows. codeoutputBufferPtrcode will always output a value. If codeinputBufferPtrcode is codeNULLcode, codehandle2code should also be null and codeCMethodcode should follow different logic to give an initial output buffer, and if not codeCMethodcode should calculate the output buffer based on the data in the input buffer.

Negative 1784 pI have some problems when handling unicode when using JSON API for communicating between iOS and my server. I know NSString is based on UTF16, and surrogate pairs will appear for some emojis.For example, a NSString will use ud83dudc94 for Unicode Character BROKEN HEART.p  pMy question is do I need to do some conversion to make a NSString suitable to upload to my server. Currently, when I upload ud83dudc94, I will get U1f494 in the JSON response.p  pMy servers database is MySQL which is UTF8 based or UTF8mb4 based.p  pI dont think it is quite reasonable for iOS end to handle this problem.

Negative 1784 pIve been working on this for a while and I dont know much about either PHP or C.  We are building an application that is using AES 128 CBC mode encryption to store things in the database.  One part is PHP and JS, the other is C .NET WPF.  p  pThe person who wrote the PHP used the Mcrypt library to cryptdecrypt.  Im using the Chilkat library to encryptdecrypt.  Chilkat had a default C example that is supposed to mimic the PHP Mcrypt.p  pCurrently I can symmetrically encryptdecrypt things on .Net, and .Net can decrypt anything from PHP.  However the PHP side cannot decrypt anything that I encrypt to the database from the .Net side.p  pIve narrowed at least part of down to encoding issues, but Im not sure how to fix it.  The decryption scheme on PHP side usually decrypts to ASCII, but for things that I send it decrypts to UTF8.  Ive tried to decrypt it then encode from UTF8 to ASCII to no avail.p  pIll show you the inoutputs and the functions. The IV is being set to 16 ASCII 0s to help my debugging along even though it shouldnt really matter.  p  pinput from .Net to mcryptencrypt func string 1220 output 3tRIG7qUxUsU7WoXDybRRcdQRobOfeFGtQ438V7XRD8br Parameter input into database  same as abovep  pinput of PHP side decrypt func  3tRIG7qUxUsU7WoXDybRRcdQRobOfeFGtQ438V7XRD8  same as abovep  poutput of the mcryptdecrypt function  JZu iconv says utf8 encodingp  pAsk for anything else and Ill get it if it would help.

Negative 1784 pI have just started learning Stata and Im having a hard time.  My problem is this I have two different variables, codeATCcode and codeAcode, where codeAcode is potentially a substring of codeATCcode. Now I want to mark all the observations in which codeAcode is a substring of codeATCcode with codeOK  1code. p  pI tried this using a simple nested loopp  precodeforeach x in ATC  foreach j in A          replace OK  1 if strposx,j0       codepre  pHowever, whenever I run this loop no changes are being made even though there should be plenty.  I feel like I should probably give an index specifying which codeOKcode is being changed the one belonging to the codeATCcodex, but I have no idea how to do this. This is probably really simple but Ive been struggling with it for some time. p  hr  pI should have clarified my codeAcode list is separate from the main list simply appended to it and only contains unique keys which I use to identify the codeATCcodes which I want. So I have 120 codeAcodekeys and a couple million codeATCcode keys. What I wanted to do was iterate over every codeATCcode key for every single codeAcodekey and mark those codeATCcodekeys with codeAcode that qualify.p  pThat means I dont have complete tuples of codeATCcode,codeAcode,codeOKcode but instead separate lists of different sizes. For example I have p  precodeATC    OK  A  ABCD   0   . EFGH   0   . ...   ...  ... .     .    AB .     .    ET codepre  pand want the result that codeABCDcode having codeOKcode is marked as code1code while codeEFGHcode remains at code0code.p

Based on internet browsing, it seems that I will have to change the main.m and objective.m files, but the ode.m should be fine. The thing is, Im still not sure what the inputs for codelsqcurvefitcode are. What do I need to change for codelsqcurvefitcode to workp  pIt seems codelsqcurvefitcode needs four inputs. So, I changed codepsolve  fminsearchp myobjectivetspan,data,p,x0, p0code from the original main model file and used codepsolve  lsqcurvefitp myobjectivetspan,data,p,x0, p0, tspan, datacode but get the following errorsp  precodeError using pmyobjectivetspan,data,p,x0 Too many input arguments.

LSQCURVEFIT cannot continue.  codepre  pAlright, so evidently lsqcurvefit should not return the sum of square differences that is present in the objective function, since it already implicitly computes it. So, I simply deleted that portion of the code... is that right I guess not, because I still get errors in fact, the same errors as abovep

Negative 1784 pIve been searching through the docs and cant find anything aesthetically pleasing for my issue. I have also searched far and wide in SO to determine if there are any other questions like it. I have not found any. So now that everyone is aware that I have done some research, lets get down to the issue at hand. p  pCurrently I have a share or open in option with UIDocumentInteractionController. It behaves as expected. I know you cant edit the email properties like you would be able to with MFMailComposeViewController, at least as far as I know. If there is a fix for that would be nice to know as well. So my question is simply put. Can a UIDocumentInteractionController behave like a UIActivityViewController, in the sense that you can excludeActivityTypes or at least register buttons with handlers i.e., if statement  if sms was clicked then perform action   My end goal is to omit some applications Messages, Mail, and basically any other application that doesnt support editing properties like recipients, changing the file name etcp  pstrongFor a fix, it would be good for you to know that this app will not be public or submitted for the App Store. So any resolution, documented or not, is welcomed.strongp  pWhat I have tried so far p  pI have currently tried setting some implementation in documentInteractionControllerWillPresentOptionsMenu but thats for updating UI underneath the controller. p  pAdditionally the only other thing I have tried is researching the web with no results. I assume its not a popular question since the purpose of the UIDocumentInteractionController is to  automatically detect which apps it can be opened with. p  pAnd no I dont want to create an UIAlertControllerStyleActionSheet because I like the look and feel of the UIDocumentInteractionController. p  pAlso, conversely to UIDocumentInteractionController, UIActivityViewController has limited options for data[PDFs] and doesnt support sending to iBooks because thats what UIDocumentInteractionController is essentially for. So that route is a no go as well. I wish they would combine it like they did with UIAlertController.p  pIn short, is there a workaround for it to behave like a UIActivityViewController p

If only I could extend Array for the given type, this would all be so simple  sadly, it looks like that simply isnt allowed yet.p  pI appreciate I may be trying to over simplify something that cant be so Swift shows so much promise, but maybe I need to wait until its matured a little morep  pAny ideas...p  pThanks for any input.p

It looks something likes thisp  precodepublic class TypedListCollectionViewltTgt  ListCollectionView, IEditableCollectionView      private FuncltTgt factory      public TypedListCollectionViewIList collection, FuncltTgt factory          basecollection              this.factory  factory           bool IEditableCollectionView.CanAddNew              get                      return this.CanAddNewItem                    object IEditableCollectionView.AddNew              T obj  this.factory         return this.AddNewItemobj       codepre  pMy question is how can I specify which ListCollectionView should the PropertyGrid use Im new to WPF and it seems like Im missing something.p

Negative 1784 pI have a procedure to QA that contains multiple instances of the rownumber over partition structure as well as county and sumx to calculate a range of metrics.  To QA this I have written a set a distinct queries that each perform one of the metric calculations.p  pThe issue I am seeing is that my distinct queries are not always returning the same results as the procedure that I am testing.  Both my queries and the procedure source the same base table and the only difference is the fact that I have multiple, discrete, queries.p  pI seem to recall reading somewhere, and I have been unable to locate that source, that utilising multiple instances of rownumber over partition in a single query may generate strange results.p  pIs this correct  Or have I missread somethingp  pCheers,p  pGaryp

Negative 1784 pIm developing a game Android app and I have a a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetHorizontalScrollView.html relnofollowcodeHorizontalScrollViewcodea that is being populated with a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetImageView.html relnofollowcodeImageViewscodea.  Each codeImageViewcode is clickable to select the level you want to play.  Im using a codeSavedPreferencecode to keep track of the last played level, and using that to determine which image is on screen when you load the menu.  That way, if youre on level 30, you dont have to scroll all the way from level 1 every time.p  pIm using a coderequestFocuscode to bring that codeImageViewcode onto the screen, and it works fine, except for two relatively minor but annoying issues.p  pHere is what Im doing in my for loop that populates the  HorizontalScrollViewp  precode        final ImageView iv  new ImageViewLevelSelect.this         iv.setImageResourcelevelImages[i]         iv.setFocusabletrue         iv.setFocusableInTouchModetrue         iv.setIdi         LinearLayout ll LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.levelSelectGallery         LinearLayout.LayoutParams lp  new LinearLayout.LayoutParams300, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT codepre  pand I make it clickablep  precode       String str  getStringR.string.level  i  getStringR.string.avail        if storage.getBooleanstr,false  check if level is available unlocked        iv.setClickabletrue        final int finalI  i        iv.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener             Override            public void onClickView v                 editor.putIntgetStringR.string.CurrentLevelsavepreferences, finalI set current level to clicked image                Intent intent  new IntentLevelSelect.this, LevelStart.class                LevelSelect.this.startActivityintent  begin LevelStart activity                             else             iv.setImageResourcelockedImages[i]  show locked image         codepre  pand outside the loop, I set the focusp  precode check if there is a saved level  focusLevel  storage.getIntgetStringR.string.SavedLevel, 5   set focus on saved level  findViewByIdfocusLevel.requestFocus  codepre  pThis brings the focused item onto the screen, but just at the edge. I would prefer it to be centered if possible. I can live with that though.  The main issue is that it seems that by setting the focus, its now requiring two presses on the image to trigger the codeonClickListenercode.  I assume the first press is changing the focus and the second is clicking.  If I remove the focus related code, it only requires one press.p  pIs there a better way to scroll the view to the desired image, or something different I should be doing with the focusingp

Negative 1784 pI wrote a java client which takes in the buffersize for the byte array as a command line argument and declares a byte array in which as file will be read and sent to the server in chunks. Client will send the buffersize to the java server before starting to read the file so that the server can also define a byte array to receive the file chunks. So this mechanism looks something like....p  pClient Sidep  precodewhile count  fileReader.readbytes gt 0      toServer.writebytes, 0, count  codepre  pServer Sidep  precodewhile count  fromClient.readbytes gt 0     process the received file content  codepre  pThis works right for me. But the behavior of the server reading the chunks changes in a random manner. i.e., If the file that is to be read by the client is of 3000 bytes and the buffersize if 8192 bytes the server will also have a buffersize of 8192, the server reads the whole chunkfrom the client with a single read operation and sometimes the chunk is divided into 2 parts and read as two 1500 bytes for example, taking up 2 read operations. I dont understand what exactly happens here. Can we implement this in such a that the server doesnt divide the chunk which is being sent by the clientp  pWhen it is tested by running both client and server in the local machine, server reads the whole content sent by the client using one write operation with just one read operation. The behavior changes happen only when the client and server is on different machines.p

Negative 1784 pSo I have a small game so far where you build ships and attempt to destroy the enemy station. Everything works fine except for when more than one ship is firing at the station. What seems to happen or at least what I believe is that the code for setting the location of the bullet is occurring as many times as there are ships. So I tried simply dividing the speed of the bullet by how many ships there are, but eventually the bullet ceases to move. Here is the code, as it is without any fix attempted.p  precodefor int j  0 j lt 9999 j      if PlayerMapData.weaponFireCreated [j]          PlayerMapData.weaponFire [j].setLocation              int PlayerMapData.weaponFire [j].x  playerMapData.weaponTravelSpeed  PlayerMapData.weaponFireDirectionX [j],             int PlayerMapData.weaponFire [j].y  PlayerMapData.weaponTravelSpeed  PlayerMapData.weaponFireDirectionY [j]          codepre  pHit detection happens below. Is the the setLocation statement the problem or do I have to differentiate between what bullets belong to what shipp  pEDIT Should have specified that this is in a timer.p

Negative 1784 pI set up a build and add two Internal Testers. Immediately after pressing the Invite button I noticed that the checkbox next to my email address was the only one that remained checked. The checkbox next to the second tester was unchecked. So I clicked the checkbox and sent another invite, but the same thing happened. I thought nothing of it, figuring it would become checked when he actually installed and tested the app. But he says he never received an invite.

Negative 1784 pi have a tree and i want to find the longest path to the deepest node and then i want to change it somehow to make it more balanced. In this very simple example i want to move 4 since it is the deepest path and instead put it in 1 so that the difference in height is not as big. I want to do this in lisp and Im not quite sure how, i know i want to use a search but its having it so that it actually does find the longest. I know how to get the path from the root to a given node but Im not sure how to actually get the deepest node. I think i have an idea in my head of how i could put the deepest node onto a better part but any advice would be great. p  pSo far Ive only got some code that will return the depth of the tree, but it there any way that i could get it to return what is the deepest nodesp  precodedefun maxdepth l   cond null l 0     atom l 0     t  1 max maxdepth cadr l maxdepth caddr l codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSSUtB.png altBasically in this very simple example i want to move 4 since it is the deepest path and instead put it in 1 so that the difference in height is not as bigp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCT8Sf.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1784 pI am new to CRM and SQLServer Reporting and I am trying to create a report that displays all notes from different entities. For those who are not familiar with CRM below is the description for the report  I have entity A FilteredAnnotation  keeps records of notes of different entities, which has a field called notetext that stores text note and objectid which stores a GUID related to a particular entity. For instance, the GUID stored in this field can be related to lets say Entity B Filterednewcandidate or Entity C FilteredNewattainmentmilestone, or other entities as in CRM every entity has relationship to Annotations entity.p  pIn my case, the person running the report will input a reference number to entity B candidate. The entity candidate has relationship with entity C attainmentmilestone, so basically I want the report to display all notes retrieved from entity A  annotation that are linked to a particular candidate.p  pAt the moment I have my query running good and displaying all results but the problem is that there is nothing to separate or specify from where exactly the notes come from. Basically, I want to be able to show or differ notes of Entity B and C. I can think of idea   a Be able to write their entity Name on top of each record, so it would be something like Candidate result  Stream result PROBLEM I have tried obtaining the name of the table but it displays the filterednew which is not very attractive to the client. So, would I be able to cut that result so it only display everything after the underlinep  pb Be able to change color according to the result. For example, if note is from Entity B, then the table line would be of color red else the table line would be of color blue PROBLEM Since I am new to that and I am using XML, .rdl I cant think of a way to do that.p  pAs the result obtained from select is kind of displayed in a foreach, I do not know how to add or differ whether result is from Entity B or C. p  pBelow image of my current report a hrefhttpimageshack.comaimg6737890WynjmI.png relnofollowhttpimageshack.comaimg6737890WynjmI.pngap  pAs you can see it is displaying notes of entity B and C from a particular person but the result is not readable its all under notetext column without any separation.p  pWould any1 know whether I could change the line colour according to whether its entity B or C, or even add a text to the top of results covering entity B, then another text for results covering entity C without losing much performancep  hr  h2EDITh2  pThanks to ShaneYo for giving a wonderful guidance with this issuep  pThanks, Dem p

Negative 1784 pHello Im having a problem in how to go about making a GUI using GUIDE to do some arithmetic on some spectra files from text files containing x data and y data. Im trying to make something like a spectrum calculator.p  pSo far I have two import file buttons called Import file 1 and Import file 2 just using uigetfile. Now I am working out how to do some simple addition subtraction of two files and then plot the result the x data is the same in all files, so Im just doing arithmetic on the y data. Later on Ill add some buttonsdrop down lists for division and multiplication by certain integer factors e.g. multiply file 1 y data by 2. p  pWhat I want to be able to do is to save the result of this plot and do further arithmetic operations on the result, and I will plot the result after each operation on the same axes. When the user closes down the GUI, they will not need to save the session or each operation result, they can just save an image the GUI figure. A new session should begin when the user opens up the GUI again.p  pDo I need to find some way of temporarily storing the information until the GUI is closed in order to perform a further operation after each result Is there a way to make a temporary variable for each result e.g. result 1, result 2 etc.. so that the user can choose which result to do an operation onp  pI want to make this calculator as generic and flexible as possible for the user so that they can go about doing any arithmetic they want on the files. I may even add more import file buttons, in which case the user will need to be able to choose which files to use... e.g. if they wanted to add the data for 3 files or add the data for just 2 files. This would make it a bit more complex, any suggestions on how I could go about organizing the GUI and codingp  pI would be very grateful for your help, as I am at a bit of a standstill in my project... Even if you can point me in the right direction, and what things to look up, it would be helpful  If you need me to clarify anything provide more information, please let me know...p  pThanks for looking at this question p  pVerap  pEDIT I think I should be using a buffer for this, does anyone know how to do thisp

From what I can google, theres something wrong with the variables in that the second pass as it sees them as a different size How do I fix this errorp  pHeres my code before I hit the first labelp  precode            .code main                mov ax, data                            mov ds, ax              mov     ax, 4000h                set up display string             mov     bx, 1                    to monitor             mov     cx, lstring1             length of string1             mov     dx, OFFSET string1                   int     21h              mov ah, 0Ah                      set up service to capture buffered input             mov dx, offset filename          where to find the input             int 21h              mov ah, 3Ch                      dos service to create file             mov cx, 0             mov dx, offset filename  2      I still to need add NULL to the end of filename             int 21h              mov handle, ax               save file handle codepre  pOn further messing around, it seems if I deleted the code that outputs to monitor with the 4000h, the error disappears.p

The tempo changes are not send out smooth ... but the basic question how to send a steady clock with CoreMidi  is solved.p  precodedispatchsourcet CreateDispatchTimeruint64t interval,                                       uint64t leeway,                                       dispatchqueuet queue,                                       dispatchblockt block      dispatchsourcet timer  dispatchsourcecreateDISPATCHSOURCETYPETIMER,                                                      0, 0, queue     if timer              dispatchsourcesettimertimer, DISPATCHTIMENOW, interval, leeway         dispatchsourceseteventhandlertimer, block         dispatchresumetimer          return timer   void timerTempodouble tempo     if ignoreTempoChange return  ignoreTempoChange is set when a MIDI start is received      inTempo  tempo     if aTimer              nTicks  tickspersecond  tempo  24  60  number of ticks for one beat.         nTicks  nTicks1000         nTicks  nTicks1000         dispatchsourcesettimeraTimer, DISPATCHTIMENOW, nTicks  24, 0         void startTimerdouble tempo      inTempo  tempo     machtimebaseinfodatat machtimebaseinfodatat     machtimebaseinfo ampmachtimebaseinfodatat   denum and numer are always 1 on my system     tickspersecond  machtimebaseinfodatat.denom  NSECPERSEC  machtimebaseinfodatat.numer      nTicks  tickspersecond  tempo  24  60  number of ticks for one beat.     nTicks  nTicks1000     nTicks  nTicks1000   rounding the nTicks to microseconds was THE trick to get a rock solid clock in NI Maschine     clocktTimeStamp  machabsolutetime     dispatchqueuet q  dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0     aTimer  CreateDispatchTimernTicks  24,                                  0,                                  q,                                                                        const int packetListSize  sizeofuint32 25 sizeofMIDIPacket                                      MIDIPacketList packetList mallocpacketListSize                                      MIDIPacket packet  MIDIPacketListInit packetList                                       Byte clock  0xF8                                       for int i  0 i lt 24 i                                                                                 packet  MIDIPacketListAdd packetList, packetListSize, packet, clocktTimeStamp, 1, ampclock                                           clocktTimeStamp nTicks                                                                            MIDISendoutPort, IAC, packetList                                        freepacketList                                        timerStarted  true   codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr  Made some progression on the response to tempo changes. p  ol listop sending packet lists when the fixed value of MIDITimeStamp is to far ahead of the machabsolutetimeli liSending smaller packet lists with only 8 clocks instead of 24li ol  pOn my system the tempo changes are send out smooth and with a minimum of latency but a small offset in the beat of the sending midi device and the DAW listening to the generated MIDIclock might occur after multiple changes of the tempo.p  pIn a live performance this would mean the drummer using the sending midi device would have to perform a stop and a start on his to device to get the sound in sync again.

The answer refers to a pane in the show output from window that does not appear in my version of luaedit.  My version only has an output window that is accessible off of the debug dropdown menu.  Though it does say show output from, there does not appear to be any way to change where it shows its output from.  The answer also refers to a green button to start debugging that is also not available in my version of the editor.  Instead, there are three buttons on the left side of the toolbar  a triangular start debugging button, a double horizontal line break now button and a square stop debugging button, all of which are blue.p  pSo...how is the problem to be solved for THIS version of this editor  Or is it a bug that the developers introduced because they had to fix an interface that wasnt brokenp

Negative 1784 pI am trying to decipher perhaps, debug, why a particular site has been able to circumvent Chromes popup blocker.p  pI analysed the page and saw a rather convoluted hierarchies of divs and iframes.p  pI read that nowadays, browsers have decided not to persistently block popups, but allow those that the browser knows is deliberately triggered by the user thro direct UI action.p  strongProblem descriptionstrong  ol liThis web site accepts an input at a very defined and consistent location.

Negative 1784 pI realise that the solution I have here is far from ideal with C, so Im asking what a proper C programmer would do in this situation. C11p  pI have a codeDialogBoxcode class, which stores a collection of buttons. At the moment I have a pure abstract inner class codeDialogBoxButtoncode with the pure virtual function codevirtual void callback constcode.p  pFrom Java Im used to using this strategy to create and instantiate an anonymous class deriving from Button inplace which implements the callback function. Something like thisp  precodedb.addbuttonnew Button Button text, BUTTONTYPE       public void callback           Callback code  codepre  pwhich is what prompted this C solution.p  pMy C solution therefore looks likep  pcodedialogbox.hcodep  precodeclass DialogBox  public      Abstract class for buttons with callback functions     class Button  private      ...       stuff         public      ...       stuff            const stdvectorlt uniqueptrltDialogBoxButtongt gtamp getbuttons const     void addbutton uniqueptrltDialogBoxButtongtamp newbutton     class DialogBoxButton   private      ...       stuff        public      Constructor     Button const stringamp buttontext, const DialogButtonType buttontype  DialogButtonTypeNORMAL        ...       stuff             Virtual callback function     virtual void callback const  0   codepre  pUsagep  precode Instantiate DialogBox db  ... args ...    Test adding buttons class Button1  public DialogBoxButton      using DialogBoxButtonButton     public void callback const           Callback code       stduniqueptrltDialogBoxButtongt button1 new Button1 Button1, DialogButtonTypeENTER   db.addbutton button1  codepre  pThis works, but its clearly not as clean as the Java version and certainly feels like Im shoehorning in something that C is not designed to do.p  pSo, how would a C programmer do this It seems conceptually right to have Button as a class since it has internal data and its own behaviour. At the moment Im thinking of using a lambda expression to pass in the callback function to Buttons constructor, but I thought Id get some expert opinion on the subject.p

Negative 1784 pstrongUpdatestrong This is a bug not in Ember but in Firefox. See a hrefhttpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid301307httpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid301307a. I will be deleting this question once the bounty expires unless someone comes up with a workaround.p  pI have an Ember app running in an iframe. Page A has a link to page B, and page B has a link to page C implemented using RoutereplaceWith, so that B does not remain in the history stack. Page C has a link which invokes codehistory.backcode, which should return to Page A. It does return to Page A, but in Firefox strongonly after reloading the pagestrong. There is no reason to be reloading the page, and this behavior is not observed in Chrome. This behavior also does not occur unless the app is running in an iframe.p  pHeres the appp  precode router.js var Router  Ember.Router.extendlocationhash Router.mapfunction  abc.split.forEachx gt this.routex export default Router   aroute.js export default Ember.Route.extendactionsbfunctionthis.transitionTob   atemplate.js This is A. lta href action bgtGoto Bltagt   broute.js import Ember from ember export default Ember.Route.extend actions  link function  this.replaceWithc      btemplate.js This is B. lta href action linkgtGOTO C no history entryltagt   croute.js export default Ember.Route.extend actions  back function  history.back      ctemplate.hbs This is C lta href action backgtGo backltagt codepre  pIf I change the codereplaceWithcode in B with a codetransitionTocode, and the codehistory.backcode in C with a codehistory.go2code everything works fine and no reload occurs. But this is not a viable solution since the browser back button must also take the user back from C to A.p  pI am using codelocationType hashcode and cannot change this easily. The problem does not occur with codelocationType historycode.p  pThe only reason I can think of why Firefox might be reloading the page when trying to return to A is due to more aggressive cache management. If that is in fact the problem, then I wonder if theres some way to tell Firefox to relax and take pages further back in the history from the cache instead of going back to the server again.p  pFYI, this is a fresh little Ember app running with the latest versions of everything in the stack.p  pAny and all ideas appreciated.p
Negative 1784 pIm using Visual Studio 2013 Pro, update 4, and TFS for version control. Im not having a good time.p  pVS keeps insisting on checking out the solution file when I open my multiproject solution. It also gives an error Unspecified Error thanks for every project in the solution.p  pI had a hunch that the source control bindings were wrong, and indeed many of the posts online suggest unbinding and rebinding. However, the problem seems to reappear every time I close and restart VS. p  pOne thing that strikes me is that the solution file appears to be bound to the folder for one of my projects. If I unbind and rebind, then it gets rebound to the toplevel folder as Id expect. But then when I restart VS, it snaps back to the original binding. p  pBefore I go chasing other potential problems, Id just like to clear up whether its normal for the solution file to be bound to one of the project folders even though the file is physically located one level above all the project foldersp

Negative 1784 pim using SDL in Lazarus for creating an opengl context and also for querying the input. This works quite good but now I want to make an LCL Component which should be cross platform. Before I was using SDLCreateWindow which creates a window for me and works without LCL. p  pbEdit The problem is partly solved, see comment belowbp  pNow for a first test I tried to use a TForm with SDL using SDLCreateWindowFrom. It requires some sort of window handle as a parameter. However the following source code just results in the program exiting without any error under Linux Lazarus 1.4.0  FPC 2.6.4  SDL 2.0.3.p    pre classlangpascal prettyprintoverridecodeprocedure TForm1.FormClickSender TObject var   DC HDC   H HWND   WND PSDLWindow begin   SDLInit SDLINITVIDEO    H Handle   DC GetDC Form1.Handle    WND SDLCreateWindowFrom Pointer H  Either of these lines ...   WND SDLCreateWindowFrom Pointer DC  causes the program to just crash    Caption SDLGetError  This point is never reached end codepre  pThe second line where I create a window was just a test because the first was not working. However this seems to be the normal way of doing it with Delphi under Windows a hrefhttpffmpegdelphi.googlecode.comsvntrunkPlayerUnit1.pas relnofollowhttpffmpegdelphi.googlecode.comsvntrunkPlayerUnit1.pasap  pIn Lazarus the TWinControl.Handle seems to be different from Delphis TWinControl.Handle because it needs to be cross platform. For example a hrefhttpwiki.lazarus.freepascal.orgLCLInterfaceRedesignIdea relnofollowhttpwiki.lazarus.freepascal.orgLCLInterfaceRedesignIdeaa But I dont understand how to get an SDL compatible handle for all platforms.p

Negative 1784 pIm working on integrating PayPal into our donation engine here at Twin Cities Public Television, and I have run into a small issue.  I use an API call to get the user information and then populate a form with it.  Then, later, we checkout and send the user back to PayPal.  Everything is working great, except the user has to sign in the second time they go to PayPal to actually make the payment.  p  pI am currently using the REST API for both the information retrieval and making the payment.  I see there is a seamless integration path with the classic API to use the access token retrieved from the initial login to make the payment.  Is there any way to do this with the REST API  I didnt see one with my research.  If not, I want to make sure before I rewrite all my code that the NVPSOAP version will work for making payments and wont require a second login.  Thanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 1784 pI am working in RStudio V 0.99.467 running R V3.2.2 on Windows10. I have a collection of vector maps from ArcGIS that I read into R with a loop using rgdal to create objects of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.  p  pThere are several data QAQC checks and fixes that I would like to perform in the same loop. For example, I wish to remove spaces from entries in the data frame. I can do this easily outside the loop, but struggle with the referencing and name assignments within the loop. Outside of a loop, this command removes all the spaces in the data  p  precode the function I want to apply to each map immediately after I read it as.data.frameapplygetmymapdata[],2,functionxgsubs, ,x   codepre  pThis function also works within the loop, but I cant reassign the new nospaces data to replace the original data. Here is some example code to show what I am trying to do and where I get stuck.  p  precode vector of names from map objects farmnames lt cGardner,Mistletoe,Omni,Sturgill   libraryrgdal    create vector of filenames based on farmnames filenames lt paste0farmnames[],FarmFieldsFINAL    loop to read maps and correct data for i in 1lengthfarmnames       name lt farmnames[i]       assignname, readOGR., filenames[i]  create map object       getnamedata[]lt as.data.frameapplygetnamedata[],2,functionxgsubs, ,x  remove spaces from map dataframe    codepre  pBut this last line returns the error Error in getnamedata[] lt as.data.frameapplygetnamedata[], 2, could not find function getlt. Im guessing that I cant put a function on the left side of an assignment Because if I just type getnamedata[] R returns the correct answer without errors.  p  pIve also tried various methods creating a temporary dataframe, changing the temporary dataframe, and then using the assign function to replace the dataframe within the map object.  But again, this works outside the loop assignmymapdata[],d and not within the loop assigngetnamedata[],d.  p  precode method 2 d lt as.data.frameapplyd,2,functionxgsubs, ,x   assigngetnamedata[],d   codepre  pBut this method returns the error Error in assigngetnamedata[], d  invalid first argument. Presumably because the first argument in assign is supposed to be a single element variable name, not a dataframe  p  pIve also created a subloop to iterate through the variable names making corrections column by column  but this seems very inefficient when I could perform all corrections with a single line in the main loop  if I could just get the assignments to work. Im hoping someone has a solution for using either of the two examples I pasted above.  p  pI am not sure how to attach example raw data for an object of class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame within StackOverflow.  If there is not enough information here to help me, I can perhaps create a public folder on GitHub and provide a link  But I expect this is a pretty basic assignment problem as I am still very new to R and programming.p
Negative 1784 pI have an angular directive called showerrors that I use for form validation.  This will apply the haserror css class to the containing div when validation fails.  This works great in most cases, such as when a user leaves the input box blur or when the user clicks the continue button this is a multistep form.  I trigger validation for all form elements on continue by broadcasting a showerrorscheckvalidity message.p  precoderootScope.broadcastshowerrorscheckvalidity codepre  pHere is the directivep  precodeangular     .moduleeStoreApp     .directiveshowErrors, showErrors  function showErrorslog, rootScope, timeout      return          restrict A,         require form,         link functionscope, el, attrs, formCtrl              var domElement  el[0].querySelector[name]             var angularElement  angular.elementdomElement             var textBoxName  angularElement.attrname             var d  new Date             var time  d.getHours    d.getMinutes    d.getSeconds              angularElement.bindblur, function                   log.debugtime   BLUR Input validation   textBoxName  .  Valid    formCtrl[textBoxName].invalid                 el.toggleClasshaserror, formCtrl[textBoxName].invalid                           scope.onshowerrorscheckvalidity, function                  log.debugtime   SHOWERRORS Input validation   textBoxName  .  Valid    formCtrl[textBoxName].invalid                 el.toggleClasshaserror, formCtrl[textBoxName].invalid                             codepre  pHere is how it is used in HTMLp  precodeltdiv classformgroup row showerrorsgt     ltlabel classcolsm2 controllabelgtZip Codeltlabelgt     ltdiv classcolsm10gt         ltinput typetext namezip classformcontrol required ngmodelvm.checkoutData.data.shipping.zipgt         ltp classhelpblock ngifshippingInformationForm.zip.error.requiredgtZip Code is required.ltpgt      ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThis all works fantastic until I try to trigger validation with a promise return, specifically modal.open.  The user can open a modal that allows them to select a previously saved address which is populated on the form.  When they do this, I want validation to trigger.  Again Im using the showerrorscheckvalidity message.  This hits the function in the directive, but the angularjs form error values have not yet updated.  If I call rootScope.digest I get an error that a digest is in progress.  How would I cause the directive to fire AFTER the angularjs scope.shippingAddressForm.zip.invalid has been updatedp  pThe selectAddress function below is in the controller of the section that contains the shippingAddressForm and all the form elements with the showerrors directive.p  precodefunction selectAddress      var modalInstance  modal.open         templateUrl ScriptsCheckoutAddressSelectoraddressSelector.html,         controller addressSelectorController,         controllerAs vm,         size sm,         resolve              addresses function                  return shippingAddressService.getAll                                 modalInstance.result.thenfunction selectedAddress          vm.checkoutData.data.shipping  selectedAddress         if selectedAddress.id             scope.emitshowerrorscheckvalidity              , function          log.infoModal dismissed.       codepre
Negative 1784 pIm in the process of converting my messaging app from symmetrical encryption to asymmetrical encryption using RSA.
