Positive 1592 pIm currently trying to write a mechanism to import codeDataTablecode objects to Excel via Interop. There are a number of existing approaches, that typically involve  sooner or later  iterating the rows which is slow, or inserting columnbycolumn with some data cleaning which is reasonably fast but prone to out of memory errors in my usecase, probably due to allocating large value type arrays which need contiguous memory.p  pMy current solution  which works pretty well  is to output the DataTable to a CSV first in the users temp folder, import the CSV via a queryTable which allows pretty good control over the format of data inserted, and has a pretty robust driver for CSV, then delete the CSV. Taking this approach means 10k rows of 100 columns is retrieved in 2s from disk by Excel.p  pOf course, though the slowest part of this is the fact that the CSV needs to be written toread from disk by my app and Excel respectively. Thats fine for my test data, but I suspect real world usage is going to be closer to 200k rows of data, which obviously will take longer.p  pDoes anyone know of an inmemory alternative such that I could supply the QueryTable with a connection string to an in memory table and load from there instead p

Negative 1592 pI am looking for some general advice about the mp3 format before I start a small project to make sure I am not on a wildgoose chase.p  pMy understanding of the internals of the mp3 format is minimal. Ideally, I am looking for a library that would abstract those details away. I would prefer to use Python but could be convinced otherwise.p  pI would like to modify a set of mp3 files in a fairly simple way. I am not so much interested in the ID3 tags but in the audio itself. I want to be able to delete sections e.g. drop 10 seconds from the 3rd minute, and insert sections e.g. add credits to the end.p  pMy understanding is that the mp3 format is lossy, and so decoding it to for example PCM format, making the modifications, and then encoding it again to MP3 will lower the audio quality. I would love to hear that I am wrong.p  pI emconjectureem that if I stay in mp3 format, there will be some sort of minimum frame or packetsize to deal with, so the granularity of the operations may be coarser. I can live with that, as long as I get an accuracy of within a couple of seconds.p  pI have looked at a hrefhttppymedia.orgPyMediaa, but it requires me to migrate to PCM to process the data. Similarly, a hrefhttplame.sourceforge.netLAMEa wants to help me encode, but not access the data in place. I have seen several other libraries that only deal with the ID3 tags.p  pCan anyone recommend a Python MP3 library Alternatively, can you disabuse me of my assumption that going to PCM and back is bad and avoidablep

Heres the problem, though whatever I write to the sviewlog gets written to the log file twice.  The root logger only prints it once.  Its like addHandler is being called twice.  And when I put my code through a debugger, this is exactly what I see.  The code in settings.py is getting executed twice, so two FileHandlers are created and added to the same logger instance.  But why  And how do I get around thisp  pCan anyone tell me whats going on here  Ive tried moving the sviewlog loggerhandler instantiation code to the file where its used since that actually seems like the appropriate place to me, but I have the same problem there.  Most of the examples Ive seen online use only the root logger, and Id prefer to have multiple loggers.p

Negative 1592 pIve been working on an economy simulator in Java and ran into a roadblock. I have an emEconomyem class that owns a vector of emTradersem.

I was able to implement all of the above correctly, but I still need each emTraderem to be able to see how many trades he currently has open.

Negative 1592 pIve been chasing a very mysterious bug for days now, which seems to revolve around the a hrefhttpwww.zlib.net relnofollowZLIB librarya it occurs once every month or so, and only on some specific production environments. Here is what the code doesp  ol liThe program calls codegzopencode to write to a file codeXcode.li liThe program writes data to the file, doing several codegzwritecode.li liThe program finally calls codegzclosecode which flushes the file.li ol  pUsually, everything works fine and the file codeXcode is valid it is properly terminated with the CRC and the length of the source stream.p  pHowever, in one of the failures, I observe that codeXcode is corrupt the beginning of the data is correct, but starting at offset code0x00302000code, every byte is null. Even the eight last bytes, which encode the CRC and the length, are zero. However, the file has the right size And whats worse the same system successfully compressed a very similar file a few minutes earlier.p  pNote The ZLIB.DLL we are using has the version 1.1.3 yes, I know, it contains some security holes and we should upgrade to the latest ZLIB 1.2.3, but I dont want to change anything in my setup until Ive found the cause of the zeroing.p  pI think that Ive ruled out memory corruption by the way, how could a corrupt memory heap disturb codefwritecode sufficiently that it only writes zeroes to the output stream would that be plausible, the loop which openswritescloses the stream is simple and does not reveal any defects I can spot, the code does not allocatefreemess with structures in ZLIB which could be a problem, since ZLIB is linked against another C library than my application DLLs, so I can only suspect other elements in the system.p  pSomehow, I tend to have confidence in the C library CRTDLL.DLL, the Win32 API, the NTFS stack, the IO stack, the lowlevel device drivers, the firmware of the harddisks and the harddisk themselves... And yes, I also tend to believe that Visual C 2008 produces correct binaries, at least in this case p  pSo, am I right to suspect that the antivirus software could be the culprit It should be cautious with ZLIB, since at least Kaspersky recognizes the DLL as a possible threat. But would it be politically correct for an antivirus to simply write zeroes instead of the data if an infection is incorrectly spotted Or might this be a bug in the antivirusp  pOr do I totally miss the pointp

And as an added bonus, if you really want a null codestructcode you can do that too with some extra syntax codeTcode and the codeNullableltgtcode type.  Too bad reference types didnt work like this toop  pBut codestructcodes are passed by value which kills performance.  Well, first, code should be right whatever emthatem might mean and then fast.  However, there are several ways to avoid that overhead where it really matters coderefcode parameters, nullable parameters, place the codestructcode in some other class, say codeListltgtcode.p  pTrue, with codestructcodes, you cant create a class hierarchy, but inheritence is overused.  And you can implement interfaces.p  pUsing more codestructcodebased objects could make writing multithreaded code easier.p  pAre there any more infrequently cited advantages to codestructcodes  Do any of these considerations even come close to putting a dent in codeclasscodes massive head startp
Negative 1592 pIve recently set some coursework for some undergraduate students for which they have to use a small and relatively simple C library provided to them.  The main purpose of this library is to display a simple form which is composed of a coloured grid which they can manipulate, a number of buttons and a label with some text.p  pThe class they extend provides a number of abstract methods which they must implement, one of which is called UpdateAction and is automatically invoked at set intervals.p  pI have not encountered the following problem myself but in labs some of the students have encountered an intermittent InvalidOperationException being thrown from within their UpdateAction method when they close their form.  The error message is the error I would normally expect to see when you try and modify the UI from a different thread but there are just a double quote codecode where youd normally see the name of the offending control.br If this continues to be an issue we will need to reissue a fixed version of the library to them though we have already stated that this error will not impact marking of their work in any way since it appears to be a flaw in our code.p  pAs far as I can tell the students must be closing the form at such a point that the update is running and the controls they are modifying get disposed of before the update thread gets stopped i.e. it appears the controls have become null.  The strange thing is how intermittent it is, some students have never had the issue while others have had it continually.  I have never personally encountered it throughout my development of the model solutions for the coursework or in developing the library itself.p  pSo my question is at what point in a forms life cycle do the controls on it get disposed of and therefore where would it be best to put the code that stops the update thread  Currently this code is in the forms Dispose method, would it be better placed elsewherep

Negative 1592 pI recently started a project, using Apples Utility Application example project. In the example project, theres an info button that shows an instance of FlipSideView. If you know the Weather.app, you know what the button acts like.p  pI then changed the MainWindow.xib to contain a scrollview in the middle of the window and a pagecontrol view at the bottom of the window again, like the Weather.app. The scrollview gets filled with instances of MainView. When I then clicked the info button, the FlipSideView would show, but only in the area that was previously filled by the MainView instance  this means that the pagecontrol view on the bottom of the page still showed when the FlipSideView instance got loaded.p  pSo, I thought that I would simply add a UIViewController for the topmost window, which is the one declared inside the AppDelegate created along side with the project. So, I created a subclass of UIViewController, put an instance of it inside MainWindow.xib and connected its view outlet to the UIWindow declared as window inside the app delegate.

Negative 1592 pIve created a sample app, just to test and try out some of wpfs capabilities. I was basically trying out the databinding in wpf, and did the rest of stuff more or less quickly. THen, i faced an arquitectural problem yes, should have thought in advance before starting coding   and i wanted to know whats the best refactoring solution for it.p  pI have a simple interface that returns a list of objects, based on a defined process.p  precodepublic interface IDoStuffltout Tgt              IEnumerableltTgt Dostring someParam          codepre  pive created a couple of implementations for this interface. Then i have a view in wpf, which has a dropdown with hardcoded values, and depending on what you select, instatiates the implementation of the interface and populates some listp  precodeforeach var item in new IDoSTuffImplementation1ltMyObjgt.Doimp 1      MyObjs.Additem  codepre  pater on MyObjs is the DataContext for a listview, and displays things and so on and so forth, but its out of the main question.p  pthis is all hardcoded and not very nice. If i was ever to implement a new interface, id need to add it to the dropdown, and create a new foreach for that specific implementation more duplicated codep  pOk, heres my impression on making this betterrefactoring for extensibility.  I was thinking a good approach would be to use some kind of MVVM pattern, making the wpf view into a view  viewmodel. the viewmodel would use some kind of IoC like spring, which would by xml instantiate one specific implementation of the interface, and inject it to the viewmodel, which would then call its Do method and everyone happy. So this way, the only thing that would be needed to do when we implement a new component, is to add it to the xml config file. Suggestions, Comments whats the best approach, if any thanksp

Negative 1592 pI have a map. On this map I want to show live data collected from several tables, some of which have astounding amounts of rows. Needless to say, fetching this information takes a emlongem time. Also, pinging is involved. Depending on servers being offline or far away, the collection of this data could vary from 1 to 10 minutes.p  pI want the map to be snappy and responsive, so Ive decided to add a new table to my database containing only the data the map needs. That means I need a background process to update the information in my new table continuously. Cron jobs are of course a possibility, but I want the refreshing of data to happen as soon as the previous interval has completed. And what if the number of offline IP addresses suddenly spike and the loop takes longer to run than the interval of the Cron jobp  pMy own solution is to create an infinite loop in PHP that runs by the command line. This loop would refresh the data for the map into MySQL as well as record other useful data such as loop time and failed attempts at pings etc, then restart after a short pause a few seconds.p  pHowever  Im being repeatedly told by people that a PHP script running for ever is BAD. After a while it will hog gigabytes of RAM and other terrible thingsp  pPartly Im writing this question to confirm if this is in fact the case, but some tips and tricks on how I would go about writing a clean loop that doesnt leak memory If that is possible wouldnt go amiss. Opinions on the matter would also be appreciated.p  pThe reply I feel sheds the most light on the issue I will mark as correct.p

Negative 1592 pbr I have a VBox inside a Canvas. The red bars are custom components based on Canvas. All red bars are of equal height. I have 20 red bars inside the VBox.

Negative 1592 pI have a huge memory leak problem involving a Cextension Im developing. In C, I have an array of doubles called codeAcode and an int variable called codeAnotherIntVariablecodethat I want to pass to Python.

The problem is that I use the codeMyCFunctioncode function several times, and this produces a memory leakage because I dont know how to dereference the array that I get in python in order to get rid of it.p  pI tried just returning the array by doing a codereturn lstcode in the C part of the code instead of the codePyBuildValueOi,lst,AnotherIntVariablecode, but that only results in a Segmentation Fault when I try to use it in python probably because the garbage collector did his work...p  p...what am I missing here Can anybody help mep

We need around 210 hours per GridView only for a simple design. It was such a pain, you didnt believe. and Yes, we really used CSS and so on.

Negative 1592 pI have written an application which does video encoding. The encoding is a pipelined process first you fetch the video, then you encode it using ffmpeg, then you split the video into multiple parts, etc.p  pDuring the course of this, a 1 GB video balloons into several GB of intermediate data. This service is written so that a different program via RabbitMQ can handle each piece of the pipeline. Of course, the process doesnt have to run this way, which brings me to my question.p  pIm looking at storage requirements for making the app live. With cloud providers, you pay per GB of storage and per GB of transfer. So far so good.p  pWhen I transfer this 1 GB video blob from one cloud VM instance to another, or from the VM to the common storage service, does that count against my bandwidth I realize this answer will change depending on the hosts terms of service.p  pWould it make more sense to have 1 VM perform the entire process, and then spin up multiple instances of that As opposed to 1 VM only performing a single task in the pipeline I ask this question in terms of optimizing for cost lowest storage cost, lowest cost of spinning up VMs. Because the encoding will happen in batch, I am less concerned about pushing out requests emquicklyem.p  pThis scenario is a little bit unique in that I have huge amounts of binary data which cannot be stored efficiently in, say, a database. Which raises a similar question for those with experience, when your DB VM sends its results back to your web app, are you charged for that intermediate transferp  pAm I even asking the right questions Is there a guide that I should read, short of calling hosting providers and asking them about pricing myselfp

Negative 1592 pI am somewhat new to unit tests so hopefully this question makes sense.p  pMy Setup Visual Studio 2010 Entity Framework 4.1 Moqp  pI have a Service class located in my BAL which uses the UnitOfWork in my DAL.  The UnitOfWork manages access to various repositories which in turn access the database through a Context object.p  pI would like to create a unit test for a service class public method which is responsible for some very complicated GetNextObject type logic utilizing lambda expressions.p  pQuestion I can very easily Mock my DBContext and create a DBSet of objects that I want to test my Services method againstthe service class essentially queries the repository.  Is this the correct way to do this or is this more of an integration test  By mocking the Context I have removed the database, but I still am using the UnitOfWork and Repository classes.  Should I instead do a complicated mocking of all these objectsp  pThanks AFriezep

Negative 1592 pWhen I lint a URL through Facebooks Linter  Debugger, it generates a Graph Object structured like [Obj1] a hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.com380728101301 relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.com380728101301a Im using Facebooks IMDB example so its clear its not just me.

For the IMDB example, thats a hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.comidhttpwww.imdb.comtitlett0117500 relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.comidhttpwww.imdb.comtitlett0117500a this also maps to [Obj2] graph.facebook.com114324145263104 if you just swap the id from the result back into the URL.p  pHowever, even though it seems like that should be the same graph object as what was linted, it is a different object with a different id. This objects id strongcan be usedstrong with the open graph api functions, but the object itself is not actually generated until someone has explicitly liked the URL, which is not particularly convenient.p  pSo not only does the linter no longer seem to generate usable objects on its own, but it also appears that two different objects are being generated by Facebook from strongthe same metadata at the same urlstrong.

Another issue is emthat even we develop singleton design pattern to have only one checking in time, checking may get hanging and another checkings never get firedem because opening connection takes a long overpriced time for some databases. I dont know why it happens, but we tried to add codeConnection timeout30code, but honestly I cant remember gave it right result or not. Certainly not.. p  pThen this service running in time it takes as many memory as it running. I have tried many manipulations with this code, even faced one time with dead locks somewhere in code almost 100 CPU load.p  pYes, I know about native ADO .NET pooling but we cant use it because we have huge legacy code base that works in way illustrated above and should somehow improve existing check logic.p  pSo tell me your thoughts how can we get connections alive in time without pooling I need some way that can use as little amount of memory as possible existing code takes as more memory as it running, and work fast with small code changes.p  pAny help is very appreciated Really hope for your help stackoverflow communityp  pI think about using special thread that will check connections in cycle with codeThread.Sleep60000code at the end.

Also, if this isnt clear, feel free to ask questions, thanks.p  pEDIT  Probably talking to myself, but The only way that I think this is possible is if there is a method that realizes that a new page has just been created.p

Negative 1592 pI am attempting to identify a mobile device on a LAN using Nmap, more specifically an Android smartphone. Both my laptop and the target android smartphone are connected to the same access point. I can ping the device etc. When I run a standard Nmap scan against the smartphone it says all 1000 ports are closed, which is odd considering I am browsing the web on the phone while the scan is running. With no ports being open, device discovery is very difficult. p  pIs anyone aware of an efficient way to identify a smartphone on a network Or can anyone explain this kind of behaviour from the mobile devicep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1592 pId like to ask fellow SOers for their opinions regarding best of breed data structures to be used for indexing timeseries aka columnwise data, aka flat linear.p  pTwo basic types of timeseries exist based on the samplingdiscretisation characteristicp  ol lipRegular discretisation Every sample is taken with a common frequencypli lipIrregular discretisationSamples are taken at arbitary timepointspli ol  pQueries that will be requiredp  ol lipAll values in the time range [t0,t1]pli lipAll values in the time range [t0,t1] that are greaterless than v0pli lipAll values in the time range [t0,t1] that are in the value range[v0,v1]pli ol  pThe data sets consist of summarized timeseries which sort of gets over the Irregular discretisation, and multivariate timeseries. The data sets in question are about 1520TB in size, hence processing is performed in a distributed manner  because some of the queries described above will result in datasets larger than the physical amount of memory available on any one system. p  pDistributed processing in this context also means dispatching the required data specific computation along with the timeseries query, so that the computation can occur as close to the data as is possible  so as to reduce node to node communications somewhat similar to mapreduce paradigm  in short proximity of computation and data is very critical.p  pAnother issue that the index should be able to cope with, is that the overwhelming majority of data is statichistoric 99.999..., however on a daily basis new data is added, think of  in the field senors or market data. The idearequirement is to be able to update any running calculations averages, garchs etc with as low a latency as possible, some of these running calculations require historical data, some of which will be more than what can be reasonably cached.p  pIve already considered HDF5, it works wellefficiently for smaller datasets but starts to drag as the datasets become larger, also there isnt native parallel processing capabilities from the frontend. p  pLooking for suggestions, links, further reading etc. C or C solutions, librariesp

Negative 1592 pIm profiling a C application using linux perf, and Im getting a nice control flow graph using a hrefhttpcode.google.compjrfonsecawikiGprof2Dot relnofollow titleGprof2DotGProf2dota.  However, some symbols from the C library libc62.13.so take a substantial portion of the total time, and yet have no inedges.  p  pFor examplep  ul licodeintmalloccode takes 8 of the time but has no call parents.li licodestrcmpsse42code and codecxxabiv1siclasstypeinfododyncastcode together take about 10 of the time, and have a caller whose name is code0code, which has callers code2d6935ccode, code2cc748ccode, and code6code, which have no callers.li ul  pAs a result, I cant find out which routines are responsible for all this mallocing and dynamic casting using just perf.  However, it seems that other symbols e.g. codemalloccode but not codeintmalloccode do have call parents.p  pWhy doesnt perf show call parents for intmalloc  Why cant I find the ultimate callers of dodyncast And, is there some way for me to modify my setup so that I can get this information Im on x8664, so Im wondering if I need a nonstandard libc6 with frame pointers.p
Negative 1592 pIm in the process of setting up various authentication methods on a project Im working on, and the common OAuth 2.0 framework that Google and Facebook use seems pretty awesome. Reading the a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsauthenticationserverside relnofollowexample Facebook gavea though, I stumbled across something that seemed strange to me. p  pIf you look at the bottom of that facebook page, you can see an example in PHP. In their process, they first set a random string to SESSION[state], then redirect the user to the facebook authentication page, which then sends the user back to the original page, where they emcompare the state string to whats supposedly stored in the session variable.em Maybe Im missing something here, but dont you lose all session data if the user leaves your site How does this work How is your session data maintained even though you leave the site p

Negative 1592 pIm working with Rails 3 and Sunspot solr 3.5. My application uses Solr to index user generated content and makes it searchable for other users. The goal is to allow users to search this data as soon as possible from the time the user uploaded it.

This works but is this the right way to handle indexing in this scenario I read a hrefhttpengineering.socialcast.com201105realtimesearchsolrvselasticsearch relnofollowherea that calling index while searching may break solr. Also frequent manual index calls are not the way to go.p  pAny suggestions on the right way to do this. Are there alternatives other than switching to ElasticSearchp

Negative 1592 pI have some python code which generates a 2563 numpy array of data that Id like to read in with a different fortran code.p  pThis would be relatively easy if the numpy ndarray function tofile had an option to write fortran ordered data, but it does not and will always write Cordered data.

Negative 1592 pI am using codeboostasioioservicecode to manage some asynchronous TCP communication. That means I create a codeboostasioiptcpsocketcode and give the codeioservicecode to it. When I start the communication it goes schematically like thisp  pcodeAsync Resolve gt Callback gt  Async Connect gt Callback gt Async Write gt Callback gt  Async Readcodep  pI ommitted parts like resolve and bind. Just assume the Socket has been bound to a port and the hostname is resolved  so connect meaning establishing the real connection to the endpoint  p  pNow the point is that I may start several Async Connections with the same codeioservicecode object. This means for example, that while in my codeioservicecode thread the program is about to codeAsync Writecode some data, the main thread will call codeAsync Resolvecode with on Socket  but with the same codeioservicecode .  This means that my codeioservicecode now has some parallel work to do  what Id like to know is how it will prioritize the workp  pFor example it go like thisp  precodeMain Thread                    ioservice Thread  SocketAgtAsync Connect    Some other Stuff            SocketAgtCallback from Async Connect                               SocketAgtAsync Write SocketBgtAsync Connect                                        gt  codepre  pNow at this point I have to admit I am not quite sure how the codeioservicecode works. In the fourth line there are now two different asynchronous functions which needs to be executed. p  pIs codeioservicecode capable of doing the codeAsync Connectcode and the codeAsync Writecode simultaneously If that is the case it is clear that always the callback from the function which is finished first will be called. p  pIf the codeioservicecode is strongnotstrong capable of doing so, in which order will it do the work If codeSocketA Async Writecode will be called first, its callback will also be called first. Actually there will be always work until the whole operation on SocketA is finished.p  pstrongEDIT strong p  pAccording to ereOns comment I try to make my question a bit more precisep  pFrom the view of the codeioservicecode thread  is the codeSocketA Async Connectcode call asynchronous or synchronous From the view of my main thread it is of course asynchronous  it just dispatches the command and then goes on . But in the codeioservicecode thread will this specific codeConnectcode call block other operations p  pIn other words Is one single codeioservicecode capable of Connecting to one Socket while it is reading on another p  pAnother example would be if I just call 2 codeAsync Connectcode in my main function right after each otherp  precodeSocketAgtAsyncConnect SocketBgtAsyncConnect codepre  pLets say the Host from SocketA is a bit slow and it takes it two seconds to answer. So while SocketA is trying to connect would SocketB in the meanwhile also connect or would it have to wait until SocketA is done timed outp

Negative 1592 pIm using a code that looks like thatp  precodeimg.loadfunction      do some stuff     this.width   codepre  pIn my callback the image size is always 0. It might have something to do with it but my images are locally loaded.p  pBut in truth, if I do this.width, I will get the expected width and then I can do some kind of computation from here to change my extjs window.p  pAfter some tries, I realize that if I do this all the attributes I changes dont seem to have any effect at all. p  pdoing codethis.width40code wont change the width of my image but doing codethis.width  40code will change the width of my image. Its as if doing codethiscode was copying my HTMLImageElement within a new element and those change would be applied only if I added to the dom again to replace the old one. p  pIm not so sure to understand whats going on there.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis is what my codeimgcode variable contains.p  precodeimg  ltimggt img.attrsrc, ....image codepre  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pThis doesnt really change the fact that jQuery doesnt handle image size for in memory images but I felt it would be good for anyone using Extjs to not repeat my error. One of the big problem in my case is that the codeimgcode object I used was a valid object but since Im using ExtJs, I inadvertently made a stupid mistake. I created my window that way...p  precodeExt.createExt.Window,     some settings   items [       html img.wrapltdivgt.parent.html,    etc codepre  pIn other word, the event I created was on img, but I never really added codeimgcode to the DOM. ExtJs added html text to the DOM which created a new object which cant be modified through event and so on. p  pSo I do have to create an id to find the new element and all of this has to be done after a call to codemodalWindow.showcode is done. After that everything works perfectly.p  pFor resizing the window, if the dimensions are set, you can set them back to codenullcode and do a doLayout call on the window and it will recalculate windowsize. p

Negative 1592 pSo I keep hearing a lot about point free programming and I decided to do a little experiment to test my grasp of it. This involved taking a pointed function to calculate the factorial of a number and converting it to a pointfree form. I managed to do it, but the point free result is a lot less readable than the pointed result. p  precode pointed fact 0  1 fact n  n  fact n1  point free fact  foldr1  . takeWhile lt 0 . iterate flip  1 codepre  pAm I missing something essential to point free notation or is this as readable as certain transformations get To me it seems that a big part of the codefactcode function is the pattern match on zero, and indeed, pattern matching is one of the biggest reasons I love Haskell. However point free notation seems to completely disallow that, along with some other things that are extremely useful like list comprehensions.p

I gather that both uses the function codemcryptcreateivcode for generating random bytes or bits, but for some reason, I encounter errors in installing phpmcrypt under CentOS 6. Fortunately, the first link said that codeopensslrandompseudobytescode is a CSPRNG and the PHP documentation and other sources also back that claim, and is available on the current server installation of PHP 5.4, so I have no choice but to use that at the moment. With these in mind, I would like to ask the followingp  ol lipDoes a direct code substitution suffice without affecting security That is, just replacing calls to codemcryptcreateivcode to codeopensslrandompseudobytescode would dopli lipAbout the constants mentioned in the code httpcrackstation.nethashingsecurity.htmproperhashing, the guide says that [m]ake sure your salt is at least as long as the hash functions output. Am I right in assuming that codePBKDF2SALTBYTEScode and codePBKDF2HASHBYTEScode are both set to 24 bytes since the output of the codepbkdf2code function would be just 24 bytes, not 32 for 256 bits since the underlying algorithm used is codesha256code Yes, I am using key stretching too. In a related note, is 24 bytes fine, or should be increaseddecreased, and what effect would that havepli ol  pAdvanced thanks for those who will answer.p

I need to keep the codeDataRow[]code, but I would like to implement the best way to copy the source from the the table into the array.p  pThe current solutionp  precodeDataRow[] rows  DataSource.Select11, SortOrderString codepre  pAs I experienced so far, if I need to get a specified sort, that could be the best way Im also interested if it has a quicker way or not.p  pBUT there are some simplified pages, where the SortOrder is not needed. p  pSo I could make two method one for the sort order and one for without. The real problem is the second onep  precode DataRow[] rows  DataSource.Select11 codepre  pBecause it is very slow. I made some test and it is kind of strong15 times slowerstrong then the CopyTo solutionp  precodeDataRow[] rows  new DataRow[DataSource.Rows.Count] DataSource.Rows.CopyTorows,0 codepre  pI would like to use the faster way, BUT when I made the tests some old function simply crashed. It seems, there is an other difference, what I only noticed now  strongThe Select gets the rows like the RowChanges are accepted.strongp  pSo if I deleted a row, and I do not use the codeAcceptRowChangescode emI cant do that unfortunatelyem, then with codeSelect11code the row is in the codeDataSourcecode but not in the codeDataRow[]code.p  pWith a simple code.CopyTocode the row is there, and that is a bad news for me.p  pstrongMy questions arestrongp  p1 Is the Select11 the best way to get the rows by the RowChanges I doubt a bit, because it is like 6 year old partp  p2 And if 1 is not, is it possible to achieve a faster way with the same result than the .Select11 p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHere is a very basic test app, what I used for speedtestingp  precodeDataTable dt  new DataTableTest  dt.Columns.AddId, typeof int dt.Columns.AddName, typeofstring  for int i  0 i lt 10000 i      DataRow row  dt.NewRow     row[ID]  i     row[Name]  Name  i     dt.Rows.Addrow   dt.AcceptChanges DateTime start  DateTime.Now  DataRow[] rows  dt.Select  DataRow[] rows  new DataRow[dt.Rows.Count] dt.Rows.CopyTorows,0  Console.WriteLineDateTime.Now  start codepre

Negative 1592 pI have a rails application linked to a database table, which contains email addresses and passwords. I would like to  create a unique number which will identify each of the users in the system. This number will be given to a user upon registration, and stored in the field userid on the same table. So, for example, johnfoo.bar  could get 0001 as an ID, marthafoo.bar could get 0002, and so on. My question is what is the best way to do this Should I seed the database rake dbseed with the first userid 0001 and write a method in the controller to 1 the userid every time If that is the case, how can I access the last row in order to find out the last useridp  pAn alternative way would be to find the largest userid in the table and 1 it. For that I guess I need to use tablename.findbyuserid or something similar would tablename.findbyuserid.max workp  pA third way would be to store the latest userid somewhere, and have the application retrive it when needed. Where could this information be storedp  pIm very new to rails . Would appreciate your feedback about which is the best way to go.p  pThanks, TimmyOnRailsp
Negative 1592 pAlright, Ive been racking my brain, reading up excel programming for dummies, and looking all over the place but Im stressing over this little problem I have here. Im completely new to vba programming, or really any programming language but Im trying my best to get a handle on it.p  pThe Scenario and what my goal isp  pThe picture below is a sample of a huge long list of data I have from different stream stations. The sample only holds two niobrara and snake to illustrate my problem, but in reality I have a little over 80 stations worth of data, each varying in the amount of stress periods COLUMN B.p  pCOLUMN A, is the station name column. COLUMN B, stress period number COLUMN C, modeled rate COLUMN D, estimated ratep  pWhat I have been TRYING to figure out is how to make a macro that will loop through the station names COLUMN A and for each UNIQUE Group of station names, make a chart that will pop out to the right of the group, say in the COLUMN E area. p  pThe chart is completely simple, it just needs two series scatterplotline chart one series with COLUMN B as xvalue and COLUMN C as yvalue and the other series needs COLUMN B as xvalue and COLUMN D as yvalue. p  pNow my main ordeal, is that I dont know how to make the macro distinguish between station names, use all the data relating to that name to make the chart, then looping on to the next Station group and creating a chart that corresponds for that, and to continue looping through all 80 station names in COLUMN A and to make the corresponding 80 charts to the right of it all in somewhere like the  COLUMN E.p  pIf I had enough points to bounty this, I would in a heartbeat. But since I do not, whoever can solve my dilemma would receive my sincere gratitude in helping me understand run this problem smoothly and hopefully better my understanding of scenarios like this in the future. If there is anymore information that I need to clarify to make my question more understandable please comment your query and Id be happy to explain in more detail the subject.p  pCheers.p  pOh, and for extra credit now that I think about it, I manually entered the numbers in COLUMN B. Since the loop would need to use that column as the xvalue it would be important if it could loop through itself and fill that column on its own before it made the chart I would imagine it would have something to do with anything as simple as counting out the rows that correspond to the station name. But again, I know not the proper terminology to correspond the station name, hence the pickle Im in however if the veteran programmer who is savvy enough to answer this question could, Id imagine such a piece of code would be simple enough yet crucial to the success of such a macro I seek.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com80uDf.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 1592 pIm looking for the right approach to verify a currently running executable from within that executable. Ive already found a way to compute a SHA256 hash for the file that is currently running.p  pThe problem is Where do I safely store this hash If I store it in a config file, a malicious user can just calculate his own hash and replace it. If I store it in the executable itself, it can be overridden with a hex editor probably.p  pA suggestion I read was to do an asymmetrical en or was it de cryption, but how would I go about thisp  pA requirement is that the executable code hashes and endecrypts exactly the same on different computers, otherwise I cant verify correctly. The computers will all be running the same OS which is Windows XP Embedded.p  pIm already signing all of my assemblies, but I need some added security to successfully pass our Security Target.p  pFor those who know, it concerns strongFPTTST.1.3strong The TSF shall provide authorised users with the capability to verify the integrity of stored TSF executable code.p

Negative 1592 pIm working on a dynamic thumbnail generation feature for a site, and I am using modrewrite features to do a quick caching of the images that are already generated.p  pI do this with the following Rewrite conditionsp  precodeRewriteCond  DOCUMENTROOTREQUESTFILENAME    s RewriteRule  thumberimages[09][09].  thumberthumbnail.cfmsrc3ampw1amph2  [PT,L,QSA] codepre  pThe first line makes sure that the rewrite rule only forwards to my script page if the requested image doesnt already exist.p  pThis works fine in Apache 2, but when I move the same rules to an IIS server with ISAPI Rewrite 3 Lite then it always acts as if the file doesnt exist, even after the first redirect when the thumbnail has already been generated.p  pIn short, for some reason the strongsstrong flag appears as if its not working at all. I have also tried with strongfstrong and there is no change.p  pIm thinking that maybe this version of ISAPI Rewrite is using some sort of cached information to determine if the file exists or not.p  pOther than that I cant understand why it works on Apache but not on ISAPI.p  pPlease helpp  pThanksp
Negative 1592 pI am trying to automate printing of intranet websites. Since this is an application that will be put on a specific users computer, which will be run on an asneeded basis, Id like it to be as undisruptive as possible in other words, not launching IE for each page. The catch is that I need to print the first page of the website and then print the whole website again, which will produce the first page two times. What is the best way to do thisp  pI have no problem getting it to loop through the pages that it needs to print, nor do I have a problem opening the page with webbrowser. I do, however, have a problem specifying a print range. p  pI also tried PrintDocument, but couldnt figure out how to get that to open within the form.p  pThanks for any help that can be provided.p

Negative 1592 pSharepoint 2010 Enterprise PerformancePoint KPI using multiple data sourcesp  pI am attempting to create a KPI that uses multiple data sources, with the actual data coming from an analysis services cube, and the target data coming from either a sharepoint list or excel services data source.p  pThe setup is dead easy, adding  multiple data sources etc. The problem comes trying to get the two data sources to correctly apply dimension or time filters.p  pBasically if my Excel Services data columns source looks like thisp  p Date  Area  Target p  pAll that happens when the target data source is specified is the entire list gets summed up and put against every cell. So if the scorecard is showing area a dimension on rows, and a date on columns, whatever the sum total of my targets summed on date and area is listed as the target on every single row and every date.p  pIt seems to me that the dimensions specified in the actual KPI section and the scorecard dont map to the other data source. p  pIm wondering is what Im trying to do possible It seems like a great idea  the result would be management would have a really easy spread sheet they can access through sharepoint, modify targets and then save and have it updated across all the relevant KPIs.p  pWhat is the common solution for this Do you have to get the target data into the same AS cubep

Negative 1592 pI am using MVC 3. Suppose I have a Base Controller and several derived controllers. I am using IoC and my base controller constructor looks like thisp  precodeprivate readonly ICacheProvider cacheProvider private readonly ILoggerProvider loggerProvider private readonly IAuditProvider auditProvider public abstract class MyControllerBase  Controller    protected MyControllerBaseICacheProvider cacheProvider, ILoggerProvider loggerProvider, IAuditProvider auditProvider, ...        cacheProvider  cacheProvider     loggerProvider  loggerProvider     auditProvider  auditProvider     ...     codepre  pSo far so good Maybe.

If I need to add a new provider I have to refactor all my derived controllers.p  pI thought I would create a ServiceProvider or Service strongLocatorstrong  class and IServiceProvider interface, which would have a constructor and all providers as parameters where IoC would do its job and expose them as properties. Then my base constructor and derived constructors would only have the IServiceProvider as a parameter.p  pHowever I am concerned that this approach will have some negative impacts, for example 1 Hidden implementation I dont know which provider I use or need unless I check the implementation. 2 Hard to test when the constructor contains parameters I can easily test it and I know what to expect autodocumented.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestion or commentsp

Negative 1592 pI have seen multiple anwsers where it is advise to run codeGC.CollectGC.MaxGenerationcode.br Since the method codeGC.Collectcode will collect all the existing generations, is there any difference between the two  p  pMaybe if there is only two generations alive instead of three, the GC will collect two generations, and will not attempt to collect the third, and this will increase performance.

Negative 1592 pLet me start by describing the scenario. I have an MVC 3 application with SQL Server 2008. In one of the pages we display a list of Products that is returned from the database and is UNIQUE per logged in user. The SQL query actually a VIEW used to return the list of products is VERY expensive.p  ul liIt is based on very complex business requirements which cannot be changed at this stage.li liThe database schema cannot be changed or redesigned as it is used by other applications.li liThere are 50k products and 5k users each user may have access to 1 up to 50k products.li ul  pIn order to display the Products page for the logged in user we usep  precodeSELECT TOP X  FROM [VIEW] WHERE UserID  UserId  where X is the size of the page codepre  pThe query above returns a maximum of 50 rows maximum page size. The WHERE clause restricts the number of rows to a maximum of 50k products that the user has access to. The page is taking about 5 to 7 seconds to load and that is exactly the time the SQL query above takes to run in SQL. strongProblemstrongp  pThe user goes to the Products page and very likely uses paging, resorts the results, goes to the details page, etc and then goes back to the list. And every time it takes 57s to display the results.p  pThat is unacceptable, but at the same time the business team has accepted that the first time the Products page is loaded it can take 57s. Therefore, we thought about strongCACHINGstrong.p  pWe now have two options to choose from, the most obvious one, at least to me, is using .Net Caching in memory  in proc. Please note that Distributed Cache is not allowed at the moment for technical constraints with our provider  hosting partner.p  pBut Im not very comfortable with this. We could end up with lots of products in memory when there are 50 or 100 users logged in simultaneously which could cause other issues on the server, like .Net constantly removing cache items to free up space while our code inserts new items.p  pThe strongSECONDstrong optionp  pThe main problem here is that it is very EXPENSIVE to generate the User x Product x Access view, so we thought we could create a flat table or in other words a CACHE of all products x users in the database. This table would be exactly the result of the view. However the results can change at any time if new products are added, user permissions are changed, etc. So we would need to constantly refresh the table which could take a few seconds and this started to get a little bit complex.p  pSimilarly, we though we could implement some sort of Cache Provider and, upon request from a user, we would run the original SQL query and select the products from the view 57s, acceptable only once and save that result in a flat table called ProductUserAccessCache in SQL. Next request, we would get the values from this cachedtable as we could easily identify the results were cached for that particular user with a fast query without calculations in SQL. Any time a product was added or a permission changed, we would truncate the cachedtable and upon a new request the table would be repopulated for the requested user. It doesnt seem too complex to me, but what we are doing here basically is creating a NEW cache provider.p  ul liDoes any one have any experience with this kind of issueli liWould it be better to use .Net Caching in procli liAny suggestionsli ul

In fact, it could happen that putting a box in its goal position could block the path to another goal. p  pOur first approach to solve this problem is trying to consider cutpositions. A certain position is a cut position if it divides the walkable space into two subsets, in which one of those we have the agent, and in the other we have one or more goals. For example, consider the following level in which x is the agent, A and B are boxes and a and b are the respective goal positionsp  precode x                        a             b         AB        codepre  pIn this case the position of goal a is a cut position, because if a box is put there, then the agent will not be able to reach goal b.p  pCan you suggest a fast algorithm to compute the cut positions, and that maybe returns the number of goals that each cut position is blockingp

Negative 1592 pI have been trying to include a file in my template which includes some functions I was intending to use for validation of the access level a member has in order to tailor content for different types of users in Joomla 2.5. The trouble is even though I have used the standard PHP include statement, none of the functions appear to be usable in the template. Instead calling the functions causes any pages using the template to crash. I could hard code the functions at the top of the template which is working, but I also have plans to use some the functions elsewhere in my web application, so it makes sense to store them in an include file. Does anyone have some insight into why the functions do not work from an include, but do when added to the top of the template The following is the top few lines of my template with the include statementp  precodeltphp  defined JEXEC  or die Restricted access  JHtmlbehavior.framework, true  include includescheckAccess.php codepre  pPlease note the functions all work fine when hardcoded into the template, so it is definitely a problem with the include. Also, the include path above appears to be correct because if the include line above is added, the template still works fine unless a call is made to one of the functions it contains. p

But it didnt work. One thing also, codeoverScrollBycode is not defined in AdapterView since HorizontalListVIew extends to this. Are there ways to implement a horizontal list with bounce or are there open source libraries that could be of help Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1592 pI have a Windows Store app with an option to export certain data in a video file format. My app is in C, but the encoding itself is handled by dropping into a C library adapted from  a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combeternalcodingarchive20130306developingawinrtcomponenttocreateavideofileusingmediafoundation.aspx relnofollowthis samplea by David Catuhe and is working well. The problem is that I have found is that the encoding process can take a long time when run at high quality, and if the screen times out say, on a Surface RT or the user switches apps, the process fails. Im not entirely sure what the source of the failure is and am working to verify it, but even if the process were able to survive suspension without changes, I dont know how to handle being tombstoned.p  pI can live with the encoding being interrupted in certain situations. What I dont want is to have to start over from scratch if the app goes away for some reason.p  pAs far as I can tell, it isnt feasible to simply close the stream without finalizing the video and resume writing to it later. In light of this, I have considered a few options, but I cant tell which, if any, might actually work. Id be very grateful for some direction.p  p1 If possible, itd be great to be able to simply close the stream and reopen it later, picking up where I left off. At the moment I havent been able to get this to work, but if it SHOULD work Id love to know.p  p2 Push the encode process to a background task, either from the start or only when tombstoned. But is there a way to pass an open stream from my app to a background task If not, is there a way to get my apps background task to run without CPUmemory limitations at least while my app is in the foreground Because doing a whole encode within the very tight constraints that normally bind background tasks would take years.p  p3 Render segments of the video progressively while the app is in the foreground and then stitch the parts together at the end. This way, if the encode is interrupted I can pick up at the most recent segment. From my reading this should be possible in theory I think it falls under the category of remuxing, which would avoid the need to reencode the video. But I havent found any samples that cover this scenario, not even in C which I have almost no experience with. The Transcode API doesnt seem to cover joining multiple samples. Ive looked into using SharpDX to do it, but the most likely candidate for what Id want to use a Media Session is only exposed for desktop apps.p  p4 Push the work off to either a desktop or server app. The problem is I want to have this run on Windows RT so desktop is out and I dont currently have a business model that can support servers capable of handling such intensive work on my customers behalf.p  pSo my question is, what is my best line of attack here Is there any way to hold onto my stream across suspension And if, as I suspect, option 3 is my best bet, do you know of any samples or guides on how to do it Obviously C options would be very much preferred, so I hope I am overlooking one. C might be OK as it was with Mr. Catuhes sample that got me this far, but Im afraid Id need some pretty specific guidance. The MSDN documentation on this, incidentally, is so highlevel that I have only a vague idea of even which pieces I would need to assemble and what each requires, let alone how to write the actual program in C.p  pAny help you could offer would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 1592 pThe following might be a generic question, but i was to curious to learn if there are any possibilities p  pCurrently there are many web applications and as part of test automation for them, several tools are being used for record and playback and such tools which are used for automation, will record the UI on the browser and while interacting with elements or controls on web page, the tools use xpath or some other identifiers to generate code and such code is less stable and may not provide seamless interaction. Many a time, the playback of such scripts stucks and may not be able to find the element or may not be able to click the controls such as buttons or checkboxes or images or radio buttons or hyperlinks etc. Sometimes, the automation script executionplayback goes unbelievably slow or times out.p  pOften, the web UI automation scripts lose focus during playback. For example the p  p1 script must a click button A, but it clicks the adjacent buttonB, 2 the script must be clicking menu itemA, but clicks menuItemB to launch pageB instead of page Ap  pwhich indicates that the script execution and application are going out of syncp  pThe behavior of these scripts also differs in different browsers. The recording is only possible when the application is up and a particular page launchedp  pSo, I was just curious to know if there is any way to overcome the problems mentioned above.p  pI mean is it possible to hand code the scripts in such way the recording is not required, but the scripts are ready with a managed code even before the applicationweb page is not launched, thus keeping a seamless and stable interactions between the script and the browsersweb applications.p
Negative 1592 pstrongSOLVEDstrongp  pWrapping each instance of the amp character in the php with htmlspecialchars fixed my problem by outputting codeampampcode instead of codeamp038code and allowed the next page to recognize each of the variables correctlyp  pstrongSOLVEDstrongp  pI am currently working on a Wordpress site and am trying to create some javascript in the php and then echo it onto the page.  Part of this javascript opens a new windowtab using window.open and a url I have generated in the php.  However, when I echo the variable containing the url, the all the codeampcode characters are auto encoded as codeamp038code.p  pHere is an example of what is happeningp  precode... gt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var url  amp var url2  ltphp echo amp gt var url3  ltphp echo jsonencodeamp gt var url4  ltphp echo htmlentitydecodeamp gt var url5  ltphp echo htmlentitydecodeamp038 gt ltscriptgt ltphp ... codepre  pThen the actual javascript that is shown when I inspect the element where the script is being inserted isp  precode... ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var url  amp038     var url2  amp038     var url3  amp038     var url4  amp038     var url4  amp038 ltscriptgt ... codepre  pI have tried urlencodeing all of the amps out of the url, but then GET does not recognize them as url variables.p  pIs this just a Wordpress thing, or is it a php thing  And, is there anything I can do to make the amps show up as just ampsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSince there seems to be some confusion on what Im trying to do, let me explain further.  I am creating a url using php, not javascript.  I am then generating some javascript using php and then echoing that out onto the page.  The above excerpt only shows the problem that I am actually facing.  The actual cod segment looks something like thisp  precodeheaderelement . ltscript typetextjavascriptgtn                 . function validateFormform n                 . tvar isInvalid  falsen                 . strallvalidation                 . tif isInvalid n                 . ttrunReportformn                 . t else n                 . talertYou must enter all report parameters.n                 . tn                 . n                 . function runReportform n                 . twindow.openpageid172ampPageIdstrpageidampReportNamestrreportname                 . strallparam, blankn                 . n                 . ltscriptgt codepre  pThe above outputs correctly aside from having all of the amp characters output as codeamp038code.p

Negative 1592 pUsing AJAX Javascript and Classic ASP, I have a site that makes an XMLHTTP call to a REST server for some HTML.  When the HTML is returned, Javascript populates a divs innerHTML with the results.  So far, so good.  All text and images appear perfect in IE910, but images do not appear broken image icons show instead in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.  After searching for hours and testing again and again, I can only find one thing out of place.p  pThe image file names actual name of the file includes 2F.  Here is an example image file name 47662thumbnailsimage300l2F572F592F60gc10acobatb12095489001.png.  Note the path 47662thumbnails and the file name image300l2F572F592F60gc10acobatb12095489001.pngp  pFor one last quirk to this, If I go directly to the REST site via browser, login and navigate to the page where this image resides, the image displays correctly in all browsers.  But when taking the HTML from the REST server call and inserting it into the divs innerHTML, images are not displayed correctly for FF, Chrome and Safari.p  pTo date, I have tried to replace 2F with forward slashes and underscores.  Both attempts fail to find the image file.  If I paste the full URL of the image file into a browser, IE displays it while Chrome, FF and Safari pop up a download dialog box.p  pI am completely stumped and could really use some help.

The first time, I named it mopubsdk, removed it from the Build Path, and saw that the folder in project explorer was still there, tried to delete it, and then got the error message.p  pThe second time, I wanted to test if having removed the SDK from the Build Path caused the problem, so I tried to readd as a Link Source, got a naming conflict error, and then named it mopubsdc instead. Trying to delete from Eclipses project explorer first still caused the error, only this time it included the options codeClick Undo to undo all successfully executed changes of the current refactoring and Click Abort to abort the current refactoring.codep  pAny ideas It might be notable that both folders have [Ignored] next to them.p

Negative 1592 pI am newbie to OSGi. My requirement is to have an android app talking to a server on OSGi framework.p  pI am looking at Apache Felix as container. From what I have understood, there are going to be bundles that are installed on Felix and they can be started and stopped from the program itself.p  pI managed to create bundles on the android side and get it up. However I am unable to get a clear picture of OSGi on the server side. The android app talks to the server using Http requests and responses.

But Please read through, was already there and done that.p  pBasically I have built a really basic service, that on a timer, it opens a message box, then restarts the timer. I am really just ensuring the service will work and install... all that good stuff. p  pProblem is when I use the VS debugger to install the service, I get a response back saying that the actions completed, but no service in task manager, or in the services section of windows management. p  pI thought ok well Ill build the service and try to install it like I would on a client machine, opened the cmd prompt and attempted to install using servicename.exe install and servicename.exe i and servicename.exe install, again to no avail nothing in either service related spots.p  pAll i get is a window that states I cannot start the service from the command line or debugger. I have tried the installutil method it suggests and again nothing. p  pIs there something I am missing in my code do I need to publish the service before it will install  I am really lost, every suggestion I have looked up on here and on MSDN hasnt worked. p  pThanks Guys. p

Negative 1592 pHi guys so my problem is possibly either a stats or a programming issue. I have two xts time series of mostly overlapping time periods and Im simply plotting a regression of their log differencesp  precode   logdiff lt merge.xtsdifflogts1,difflogts2    plotlogdiff[,1],logdiff[,2]    ablinelmlogdiff[,1]logdiff[,2],col2 codepre  pwhich gives me this plotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtC8OB.png altresultp  pSo just on an intuitive level I would rather the regression line fit the wider range of data points even if this result its giving me is technically the correct one on a least squares basis. Is there any inbuilt capability to do this broader regression or do i have to resort to manual fudgingp
Negative 1592 pIm building a nodejs app that talks to an API server. The API server requires that each request I make to it includes a codeXSignaturecode header using the codeprime256v1code ECDSA curve and codesha256code hash on a particular set of data. p  pI looked through the a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapicrypto.html relnofollowcryptoa and a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapitls.html relnofollowtlsa documentation but didnt find anything suitable. I have successfully generated a private key with codeopenssl ecparam name prime256v1 genkeycode but it is in PEM format. I have also generated a DER format key. Both of these include some extra metadata like the curve used and in the case of PEM, comments. p  pI can use these keys for signing operations on my side, but the server requires that I upload a public key using hex encoding so the server can verify the signatures I make on my requests.p  pSpecifically the server wants something like the output of the following Python codep  precodefrom ecdsa import SigningKey from binascii import hexlify hexlifySigningKey.frompemcontent.tostring codepre  pSample output for a pubkey no newlines codec5bd76cd0cd948de17a31261567d219576e992d9066fe1a6bca97496dec634e2c8e06f8949773b300b9f73fabbbc7710d5d6691e96bcf3c9145e15daf6fe07b9codep  pI would prefer not adding python as a dependency to my node app... anyone know of a way I can extract the binary data representing my private key from the PEM or DER files, so I can put it in a buffer and call codebuffer.toStringhexcode Or a way I can use the native codecryptocode library to generate the ECDSA keypair Or a library that would do the samep
Negative 1592 pI have an issue that when I submit a valid Zip file from a Java program to my Web application, the Web Application interprets the Zip file as corrupted.

However, when navigating to other pages and returning to the index page, text is rendered in a serif font. Navigation styles are not affected.  When the page is refreshed, it displays properly. Only the index page is affected.br This does not happen in any other browser.  The HTML and CSS have been validated with no errors. p  pI have tried adding  important to the sansserif font in the CSS with no change.

Negative 1592 pWhen discussing Routing using Dynamic Segments, the Ruby on Rails Guides v4.0.1 say emYou cant use namespace or module with a controller path segment.em They go on to suggest emif you need to do this then use a constraint on controller that matches the namespace you requireem. p  pIve got a lot of controllers under quite a few namespaces. If I could get dynamic segments to work in my situation then I could handle all of that routing with one line in routes.rb. Perhaps something like thisp  precodeget namespacecontrolleraction             note this isnt valid codepre  pBut that wont work see above. Id rather keep the namespaces, so I could just write out a fresh line in my emroutes.rbem file for each namespace and then add a constraint to check that the URL is asking for that namespace. That wouldnt be the end of the world. It just seems so unDRY and a shame because all the routing information is neatly presented right there in the URL. p  pIm just wondering if there are any sneaky ways round what seems to me like a bit of a gap in the capabilities of Dynamic Segment Routing. Can one get the Routing DSL to run a block that unlike Constraints does something more complex than a Boolean yesno on whether the route matches Or perhaps Im missing something in the way the standard Rails routing capabilities work. Any suggestions appreciated.p  pUpdate Just to spell it out a little bit more. My understanding of the Rails Guides is that Ill need to have lines like thesep  precodepost controlleraction , controller userdetails[] post controlleraction , controller preferences[] codepre  p...and so on. If I want 20 namespaces then Ill need 20 of these lines. Im just wondering if there isnt a more concise way that approaches my 1line ideal given above.p

Negative 1592 pFirst of all thanks for everybody who might be able to help me further on the following problem.p  pI am sending some text to several devices on serial port. Due to the already existing interface, I have to use DataReceived event to read the responses from the serial ports. There are devices that do not respond at all, so I need a timeout for waiting for the response.p  pSo for a single device, I create an instance of SerialPort, add a handler to its DataReceived event and send my text and start a timer. Timer callback runs its own thread and I would like to run the DataReceived handler also in seperate thread.p  pWhen response comes before timer ticks, the timer needs to be stopped. When timer ticks before response comes, the late response should not be handled. So there are some shared data between timer and handler threads. How do I further go about synchronizing these two threadp  pI also have to mention that I need to handle several devices simultaneously, that makes the threading situation even more complicated.p  pSo far my code for handling a single device looks like this.

Negative 1592 pDont know if it is possible, but Ill try to explain the best I can.  I have come across some code where an out of the box WSDL and XSD were being modified, primarily to have a custom XSD with the codelttypesgtcode stripped out and placed in their own XSD instead of living in codelttypesgtcode.  Small changes were made to some of the classes to change inputoutput object types for some reason.p  pIn the future if there are any updates to the WSDL, someone will have to go in by hand and remod the XSD to match our needs, plus have the new items from the updated WSDL version.p  pAfter hunting around on SO it seems that you can import multiple schemas into a WSDLs codelttypesgtcode definition.  I was wondering the order in which those XSDs load, is it related to their ordering in the codelttypesgtcode  Is it possible to override classes that would be common between both XSDs the original, and the modded onep  pBasically I want to pull out the modded changes and put them in their own, very lightweight, XSD to reduce the footprint.  Once they are in their own XSD, any new WSDL changes new versions, etc can get pulled right into a base XSD while having the small overriden class list in the mod XSD.  The classes would have the same namespace and same class name.p  pstrongWhats the correct is it possible way to do something like thisstrongp  pstrongWSDL Filestrongp  precodeltwsdldefinitions xmlnssoaphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdlsoap  xmlnstnshttpexample.comExampleNamespace  xmlnswsdlhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdl  xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema  xmlnsxmimehttpwww.w3.org200505xmlmime  nameExampleService  targetNamespacehttpexample.comExampleNamespacegt ltwsdltypes xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt     ltxsdschemagt         ltxsdimport schemaLocationORIGINAL.XSD             namespacehttpexample.comExampleNamespace gt         ltxsdimport schemaLocationOVERRIDE.XSD             namespacehttpexample.comExampleNamespace gt     ltxsdschemagt ltwsdltypesgt ....... ltwsdldefinitionsgt codepre  pstrongORIGINAL XSDstrongp  precodeltxsdschema xmlnssoaphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdlsoap xmlnstnshttpexample.comExampleNamespace xmlnswsdlhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdl xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxmimehttpwww.w3.org200505xmlmime targetNamespacehttpexample.comExampleNamespacegt ltxsdcomplexType nameComplexTypeAgt     ltxsdsequencegt         ltxsdelement nameexampleElementOne typexsdbase64Binary gt         ltxsdelement nameexampleElementTwo typexsdbase64Binary gt     ltxsdsequencegt ltxsdcomplexTypegt ... ltxsdcomplexType nameComplexTypeNgt     ... ltxsdcomplexTypegt ltxsdschemagt codepre  pstrongOVERRIDE XSDstrongp  precodeltxsdschema xmlnssoaphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdlsoap xmlnstnshttpexample.comExampleNamespace xmlnswsdlhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdl xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxmimehttpwww.w3.org200505xmlmime targetNamespacehttpexample.comExampleNamespacegt lt Override only ComplexTypeA gt ltxsdcomplexType nameComplexTypeAgt     ltxsdsequencegt         ltxsdelement nameexampleElementOne typexsdstring gt         ltxsdelement nameexampleElementTwo typexsdstring gt     ltxsdsequencegt ltxsdcomplexTypegt ltxsdschemagt codepre

Negative 1592 pIm writting a program to encript data. It has a JTextArea to edit text, but I want to choose if I save it encripted or in plain text. For this I created a JDialog that appears when the save button is clicked. It contains two radio buttons one to save the data encripted and the other to save in plain text. In the middle of them there is a JPasswordField requesting the key of the encription.p  pMy question is if there is a simple way of making the TextField not useable and half transparent, when the option to save encripted is not selected.

Negative 1592 pFor starters, Im a novice in functional programming and F, therefore I dont know if its possible to do such thing at all. So lets say we have this functionp  precodelet sum x y z  x  y  z codepre  pAnd for some reason, we want to invoke it using the elements from a list as an arguments.

It seems impossible to determine type of the codefcode with a static type system. brTheres a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6168880howdoidefinelispsapplyinhaskellidentical questiona for Haskell and the only solution uses codeData.Dynamiccode to outfox the type system.

I dont think that WebBrowswer.DocumentCompleted event is the solution here, because as far as I understand the usage of it, I would have to put whole code into one codewebBrowser1DocumentCompletedcode method in a large number of codeifcode statements, which seems really wrong.p  pThe pseudo code would bep  precodeprivate void DoOneSpecificThing string[] ListOfThings      foreach string ID in ListOfThings            open webbrowser and navigate to page        CheckIfLoaded       Log In and load the first page        CheckIfLoaded       Tick a bunch of tickboxes, write in textboxes etc       Submit        CheckIfLoaded       Go to the next page        CheckIfLoaded       And do more stuff       Submit       codepre  pThere are a lot of procedures like that in my code e.g. for logging in, for navigating to selected page, for filling forms, for setting options, for generating reports, so I would like to have one simple thing that would make sure that the page is loaded before trying to access its element, as I had in vbs.p  pI tried the following two solutions in the first one, the application never gets to load a pagep  precode        int counter  0         while webBrowser.ReadyState  WebBrowserReadyState.Complete                      counter  1          codepre  pin the second, the application doesnt actually wait for the page to load, so I tend to get null reference errors and this kind of stuff codeInvalidArgumentValue of nav is not valid for windowId.codep  precode        while webBrowser.ReadyState  WebBrowserReadyState.Complete                      Application.DoEvents          codepre  pHelp will be greatly appreciated Thanks in advancep  pBartoszp

Negative 1592 pI successfully implemented an codeAlertDialogcode that shows a codecustomstyledrowcode of codeCheckedTextViewscode. The problem comes when selecting the items. At the end, the order is going to be established by their position in the codeListViewcode. If a user selects an item from the bottom of the list and then an item from the top, the answer given by the codeDialogscode codeOnClickListenercode will begin with the top one instead from the bottom one. Is there a way to sort these items by clickp  pHere is my implementation to retrieve the items checkedp  precodeprivate void setCheckedItems      SparseBooleanArray checkedItems  listView.getCheckedItemPositions     if checkedItems  null          for int i  0 iltcheckedItems.size i              if checkedItems.valueAti                  mSelectedItems.addtables[checkedItems.keyAti]                             codepre  pNote I tried to avoid this problem by calling codeOnItemClickListenercode on my codeListViewcode, but the items that were in positions longer than the space of the screen began to be checked as well. So, at the end I used codelistView.setChoiceModeListView.CHOICEMODEMULTIPLEcode instead of the click listener.p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 1592 pSo im attempting to do the Eular project. If you dont know its 400 or so mini programming challenges. I just started and im on number 4. So the challenge is to find the largest number that can be reversed and equals itself and it has to be the product of two three digit numbers. For example 11111112321 if reversed it still equals 12321. here is the code.p  precodeEular x999 y999 z[] win0 w[] while xgt99     while ygt99         z.appendxy         w.appendz.reverse         if zw             printx,y             printDONE             win1             winxx             winyy         z[]         yy1         w[]     y999     xx1 printdone if win1     printwinx,winy codepre  pSo whats happening is that the w list is not working. It says it cant reverse the z list. Please help its probably just a stupid mistake, but i cant figure it out. Thanxp

Negative 1592 pBootstrap Carousel Images are squishing with the same height.  They are not scaling properly.  I have searched and tried several solutions, however, they have not solved my problem.  Here is my html.  p  pI tried adding adding links to several different css files.  I also tried adding several links to different js files.  I tried to change the height from 500px to auto.  I tried changing minwidth 100 to width 100.  p  pI am using Bootstrap 3.0, however most of the solutions refer to earlier versions.  The solutions that referred to 3.0 did not work.  I just started learning BS.  I have a good working knowledge of html and css.  I believe that this has to do with js, but I cannot figure out my specific issue.

Negative 1592 pI have a Windows Server running as a Virtual Machine on Azure that I have installed SQL Enterprise on.  I installed SQL Server onto a new drive E so that the C drive would remain for the OS.p  pI followed the instructions on how to use sysprep and basically capture the image to use going forward for new instances.  After following these steps and deploying a new vm with this image, nothing worked.  It thought SQL was installed it wasnt.  It also didnt know anything about the additional drives or VHDs.p  pI came across this Blog post from the Azure team and it references a powershell command codeSaveAzureVMImagecode that may be what Im looking for with the new Virtual Machine Image.p  pUltimately what I want is to have an image that I can use to deploy a new fully functional Windows Server instance with SQL Enterprise installed and the additional VHDs being used...  Can someone point me in the right hemisphere on this please...p
Negative 1592 pI have 2 threads in a process.  One mallocs and writes packets to a global linked list. The other keeps reading packets from the global linked list, sends them out through a hardware call and then frees the memory.  This piece of code handles a really large number of packets at a high rate.p  pEverything works fine except for this one isolated case, where the process aborted due to what seems to be a failed malloc.

While debugging, Ive noticed that the direction field in Step was for some reason unloaded when trying to read its value in Monodevelop. After putting some breakpoints in the constructor and the getDirectionFromInputAxes function, I noticed that the static function is entered from the second constructor, but as soon as I step, the function is exited and it seems to jump to the main constructor, as if the function has returned. In the main constructor, d is undefined, but l is defined. This results in a Step object with no defined direction, but a defined length, which causes other problems in the codep  pIm not sure why this is happening. My theory is that its wrong to call a static function from a constructor. But why would that be the case Perhaps Im using enums incorrectlyp  pany constructive comments on my style would be appreciatedp  pEDIT Fixed a mistake. Step is actually a struct, not a class. Although Ive tried changing it to a class and the problem still occurs.p  pEDIT2 The code that throws the NullReferenceException is the second line of the followingp  precodeStep step  new StepInput.GetAxisHorizontal, Input.GetAxisVertical, 1 ifstep.direction  Step.Direction.None ampamp step.length  0      FieldData.player.isValidStepstep         We cant take this step. Ignore.     break  codepre  pThis code is located in another class.

Negative 1592 pI am developing an instruction app for a product. The opening screen of the app is a page with all the different models of the product. When a user clicks one, they are brought to a screen with an image of the product, that is mapped using an image map so the user can click on different buttons to see what they do. From there, they can view instructions on using the product.p  pThe strange behaviour Im experiencing is most noticeable with the iOS app built using PG Build, though it does exist on the Android app also. When the model is selected, there is a big delay between that and when the image map loads  which in itself is tolerable.

Negative 1592 pI have a problem here and its making me mad. I maintain a legacy php system. Its badly organized, no frameworks are used and a lot of other problems, for example, at least 5 different query versions are used in different parts of the system.p  pSo my problem right now is this, I have a search form, when a button is clicked it shows a list of items, lets call this a list of A objects. In each A item, there is an expand toggle button to show the B items that belong to A this is done using ajax, by setting a specific divs html to the ajax response. Then each B also has an expandtoggle button to show the C items that belong to B.p  pWhat is happening I click to search, all A are shown. I click on the expand to show the B items of one A object, they are shown. I click B to hide it, it hides and then show again. If I click it one more time, it hides, shows and hide. So it is like every ajax request is including the javascript code and running it.p  pI think this is pretty much an organization problem, I am not knowing how to includerequire and insert the js correctly. Ive been trying to solve this issue since yesterday and I think Ive seen the code so many times that I cant think out of the box.p  pSo heres some of the organization I changed the names because there are some business rulesp  pSearchResults.php  Declares a class that has static methods to print out HTML of each item A, B and C and some other helper methods. To make stuff work, it has a require js.php otherwise the A expand button does not work because it does not exist at the time the js is executed and no function is bound.p  psearch.php  the HTML form with all the search options, nothing important.p  pjs.php  the javascript stuff, why is it in a .php I cant even remember, but I think it is because with the php I can requireincludep  precodeltscript typetextjavascript src..utiljsjquery1.8.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt  var jQ  jQuery.noConflicttrue  jQdocument.readyfunction     jQ.loadBfromA.click functione       if div.style.display  none        alertwas hidden, now is showing        call ajaxB.php        response is put into the div using .htmldata      else        alertwas showing, now is hidden     ... codepre  pajaxB.php  the ajax that access the database and echoes html code that will be put into the A items div.

Negative 1592 pExample scenario When copying a line from Microsoft Word, it gets copied to clipboard and the text can be pasted to notepad and to others as well.p  pMy problem I want to develop an application that can copy a tuple from MySQL database.

Negative 1592 pHey Guys so basically Im writing a program where you prompt the user how many first names he wants to store. You then create the pointer based on his response. After, you prompt him how many first names he wants to add to the pointer. So basically Im trying to expand the same array by using realloc but Im not sure if Im using it correctly or notApparently not since its not working Basically I want the first names that the user already inputted to stay as is, and for the program to start off asking the user for the next first name he wants to input. For example if the first time the user enters the number 2. Then he writes two names and then asks to add 2 more names, the program should keep the first 2 names and be ready to store at firstNames[2].

Negative 1592 pIm doing some practice on codewars and I dont understand what is causing my program to fail the test suite. The code is supposed to find the min value in an array or the index of the min value based on the second parameter passed in. Here is my code followed by two test functionsp  precodemy code function minarr, toReturn    var min  arr[0]   var index  0   forvar i in arr     ifarr[i] lt min       min  arr[i]       index  i           return toReturn  value  min  index    example function usage Test.assertEqualsmin[1,2,3,4,5], value, 1 Test.assertEqualsmin[1,2,3,4,5], index, 0 codepre  pMy function passes the two tests above. I run the full test suite and I get an error Expected 5, instead got 5 Im not sure why this is because I set my min variable from arr for the value and index should just be a number, so idk how it could be a type mismatch. Does anyone have any ideas about what is happening herep

For every Article document, there is an ArticleMetaData and vise versa. A OneToOne BiDirectional relationship. For legacy reasons, the two document types need to be in separate collections.

Negative 1592 pSo we are used to say to every R new user that emcodeapplycode isnt vectorized, check out the Patrick Burns a hrefhttpwww.burnsstat.compagesTutorRinferno.pdfR Infernoa Circle 4em which says I quotep  blockquote   pA common reflex is to use a function in the apply family. strongThis is notstrong   strongvectorization, it is loophidingstrong. The apply function has a for loop in   its definition. The lapply function buries the loop, but execution   times tend to be roughly equal to an explicit for loop.p blockquote  pIndeed, a quick look on the codeapplycode source code reveals the loopp  precodegrepfor, capture.outputgetAnywhereapply, value  TRUE  [1]         for i in 1Ld2       else for i in 1Ld2  codepre  pOk so far, but a look at codelapplycode or codevapplycode actually reveals a completely different picturep  precodelapply  function X, FUN, ...

So how is this different from code.Internallapply..codep  pActually a quick benchmark reveals that codesapplycode performs no worse than codecolMeanscode and much better than a codeforcode loop for a big data setp  precodem lt as.data.framematrix11e7, ncol  1e5 system.timecolMeansm  user  system elapsed   1.69    0.03    1.73  system.timesapplym, mean  user  system elapsed   1.50    0.03    1.60  system.timeapplym, 2, mean  user  system elapsed   3.84    0.03    3.90  system.timefori in 1ncolm meanm[, i]  user  system elapsed   13.78    0.01   13.93  codepre  pIn other words, is it correct to say that codelapplycode and codevapplycode strongare actually vectorisedstrong compared to codeapplycode which is a codeforcode loop that also calls codelapplycode and what did Patrick Burns really mean to sayp
Negative 1592 pThe problem that I have is the following I get from a process, a set of valuesp  precodet903 a432 c335 codepre  pAnd these values goes in a dictionary, which assign different sequences of t, a and c to different keysp  precodekey1  t1 a1 c1, t2 a2 c2, ...tn an cn key2  t1 a1 c1, t2 a2 c2, ...tn an cn codepre  pWhat I would like, is to not add a triplet of values to a key, if the first value say t, is already present. Basically I would use t variable as unique factor for my triplet. This only apply for each key, so I dont mind if I have the same value on key 2...key n the important is that each key has an unique value of t, and that the 3 values are written in the dictionary only if the value of t is unique.p  pI tried thisp  precodefor triplets in dict[key1]     if not t in triplets         dict[key1].appendt,a,c codepre  pBut this seems to not be working.

Negative 1592 pI am trying to debug a problem with some code that uses codezlibcode 1.2.8. The problem is that this larger project can make archives, but runs into codeZDATAERRORcode header problems when trying to extract that archive.p  pTo do this, I wrote a small test program in C that compresses deflates a specified regular file, writes the compressed data to a second regular file, and extracts inflates to a third regular file, one line at a time. I then codediffcode the first and third files to make sure I get the same bytes. p  pFor reference, this test project is located at a hrefhttpsgithub.comalexpreynoldszlibtest relnofollowhttpsgithub.comalexpreynoldszlibtesta and compiles under Clang and should also compile under GNU GCC.p  pMy larger question is how to deal with header data correctly in my larger project.p  pIn my first test scenario, I can set up compression machinery with the following codep  precodezerror  deflateInitthisgtzstreamptr, ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONLEVEL codepre  pHere, codeZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONLEVELcode is code1code, to provide best speed. I then run codedeflatecode on the codezstreamcode pointer until there is nothing left that comes out of compression.p  pTo extract these bytes, I can use codeinflateInitcodep  precodeint ret  inflateInitthisgtzstreamptr codepre  pSo what is the header format, in this casep  pIn my second test scenario, I set up the deflate machinery like sop  precodezerror  deflateInit2thisgtzstreamptr,                         ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONLEVEL,                         ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONMETHOD,                         ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONWINDOWBITS,                        ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONMEMLEVEL,                        ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONSTRATEGY codepre  pThese deflate constants are, respectively, code1code for level, codeZDEFLATEDcode for method, code1516code or code31code for window bits, code8code for memory level, and codeZDEFAULTSTRATEGYcode for strategy.p  pThe former codeinflateInitcode call does not work instead, I must use codeinflateInit2code and specify a modified window bits valuep  precodeint ret  inflateInit2thisgtzstreamptr, ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONWINDOWBITS  16 codepre  pIn this case, the window bits value is not code31code as in the codedeflateInit2code call, but code1532code or code47code. p  pIf I use code31code or any other value than code47code, then I get a codeZDATAERRORcode on subsequent codeinflatecode calls. That is, if I use the same window bits for the codeinflateInit2code callp  precodeint ret  inflateInit2thisgtzstreamptr, ZLIBTESTCOMPRESSIONWINDOWBITS codepre  pThen I get the following error on attempting to codeinflatecodep  precodeError inflate to stream failed [3] codepre  pHere, code3code is the same as codeZDATAERRORcode.p  pAccording to the documentation, using code31code with codedeflateInit2code should write a codegzipcode header and trailer. Thus, code31code on the following codeinflateInit2code call should be expected to be able to extract the header information. p  pWhy is the modified value code47code working, but not code31codep  pMy test project is mostly similar to the example code on the codezlibcode site, with the exception of the extractioninflation code, which inflates one codezstreamcode chunk at a time and parses the output for newline characters. p  pIs there something special about running codeinflatecode only when a new buffer of extracted data is asked for  like header information going missing between codeinflatecode calls  as opposed to running the whole extraction in one pass, as in the codezlibcode example codep  pMy larger debugging problem is looking for a robust way to extract a chunk of codezlibcodecompressed data only on request, so that I can extract data one line at a time, as opposed to getting the whole extracted file. Something about the way I am handling the codezlibcode format parameter seems to be messing me up, but I cant figure out why or how to fix this.p

Negative 1592 pI have some python code that relies on an external server to be running. On launch, the server outputs a string to STDOUT indicating that it is ready to receive requests. What I am hoping to do is, from my python code, launch the server, wait for the output string, run the rest of my python code, then shut down the server. So far however, all I have been able to figure out how to do is either a launch the server and continue immediately creating a race condition that typically fails, or b launch the server and wait for it to complete which never happens since it is a serverp  pIs there any way to launch the process, and then block until output is received but not until the process finishes, as communicate does I can, of course, simply put in a time delay, but this is obviously kludgy at best.p

Since the application has initially been developed with login form, and Spring security configured programmatically with Java code instead with xml files, jdbcAuthentication is implemented. p  pSo, when user is accessing the application with certificate, his CN has to be checked against database. For form login, naturally, his username and password have to be checked against database.p  pIs something like this possible to implementp

Negative 1592 pIm using R and I have a vector, lets just say vec lt c110. I need to sample from this vector about 1000 times, however the sample size that I need to use is a noninteger, for example 3.66666. Obviously when I input this in, it rounds down to 3. What Id like to do is take multiple samples, at the sizes of the two integers outside the noninteger number for example 3 and 4. Hopefully, the output would give a series of samples, varying between sizes 3 and 4, but the average sample size of the 1000 samples would be 3.666666. If these could be stored in a matrix that would be ideal.p  pThis is further complicated as I have a series of different non integer values that need to be used as a sample size, each sampled 1000 times also. These are currently stored in a vector, sample.size lt c3.6666, 4.25, 5.3 p  pFinally, each of the samples in the vector have a unique weightprobability for their sampling. In taking just 1 sample, I know you can create a vector representing the weightprobability for each value in the original value, however with this further complicated scenario, I dont know even know where to begin with this.p  pIm not entirely sure if this entire process can be done, nor do I really know where to start, but any help would be appreciated.p

Like I said Ive got the service wired up and working using ngResource.  the service is a combination of the resource element and a factory injected helper method that wires up the payload JSON required in the POST.p  pAn example of how I can successfully test my service in a controller isp  precodepeoplePickerControllers.controllerPeoplePickerSearchCtrl,         [scope, PeoplePickerUtils,            functionscope, PeoplePickerUtils                 scope.Data  PeoplePickerUtils.resolveUserscott  ] codepre  pThis calls a method that was factory injected into my service module.  When assigning the scope element Data to the results then binding that data with p  precode Data  json  codepre  pI get the expected results.p  pHowever because this service method is something that needs to be called repeatedly during UI interaction and within almost every controller I wanted to bind it globally.p  pfollowing a few different discussion threads I decided on using the app.run to wire it up to the rootScope like sop  precodemyApp.run[rootScope,PeoplePickerUtils,    functionrootScope, PeoplePickerUtils         rootScope.PeoplePicker  PeoplePickerUtils     ] codepre  pI know this concept works, because the following code sample runs without problemp  precode myApp.run[rootScope,myUtilMethod,           functionrootScope, myUtilMethod                rootScope.myGlobalFunc  functionparams  return params                   ]              myApp.controllerMainCtrl, [scope, functionscope]   ltscriptgt   ltdiv ngcontrollerMainCtrlgt       ltpregt myGlobalFuncfoo ltpregt   ltdivgt codepre  pUnfortunately when I bind the service reference in to the root scope and call it from within the page I get stuck in an eternal loop that eventually crashes Chrome.  The errors are as followsp  precodehttperrors.angularjs.org1.3.15rootScopeinfdigp010ampp15B5DREGEXSTRINGREGEXP  angular.js63get.Scope.digest  angular.js14346get.Scope.apply  angular.js14571done  angular.js9698completeRequest  angular.js9888requestLoaded  angular.js9829 angular.js11655 Error [rootScopeinfdig] 10 digest iterations reached.

Aborting Watchers fired in the last 5 iterations [] codepre  pso Im rather stuck, and believe its because I dont fully understand how the promise of ngResoure works. My conclusions arep  ul lipWhen used inside of a controller to bind to scope elements my service works as expected.p  ul liWhen bound to the rootScope the function appears to get stuck in some kind of recursive loop.li ulli ul  pIve boiled all of this down to minimal code in a single page however unless you have a SharePoint 2013 or Office365 site the code wont exactly run.  Ill share it if anyone thinks it is valuable to this discussion but I personally think its my lack of understanding thats causing it.p

Negative 1592 pI am currently in a desperate situation as I have tried various websites and resources however, they have all been unsuccessful. p  pUltimately I rolled back too far on my localhost and my database was cleaned out. My localhost and active website never shared the same data on the database, which I now know they should. I lost my localhost data but my website a hrefhttpwww.joedayvie.com relnofollowhttpwww.joedayvie.coma is still intact with all the information. My fear is once I codegit push heroku mastercode or migrate to heroku, the data on my live website will be cleaned out.p  pFor the last two days I have been trying to pull the data from the database onto my localhost as to not lose anything however, I cannot seem to make it work. After much research, I completed the pgpull method and pgrestore but neither made any changes to my localhost. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or am missing another step, but obviously something still needs to happen.p  pI have read many tutorials, googled everything and tried many methods without being too lost but nothing I am still selflearning everything and databases are a weakness of mine granted this has made me learn a lot more P. p  pIf anyone has any information, I desperately ask you to let me know  I will be lurking this thread in hopes of responses and I will answer quickly. Any information will be helpful and I will respond to you ASAP.p  pThank you so much for your time and reading this  I look forward to resolving this issuep  pJoep

Negative 1592 pI am currently trying to set up a panorama viewer in JavaFX using its 3D features. I think I got the geometry right 3D subscene, TriangleMesh, etc. but I am fighting with the proper lighting. What I need is actually no lighting at all, just the geometrically correct display of the original colors of the texture image. JavaFX seems to introduce some unwanted default lighting if there is no explicit lighting specified and is driving me crazy.p  pCan anybody tell me how to set up the material and the light sources and maybe other related stuff if I do not want to have any lighting at all but just the plain image texture colorsp  pEdit Here is the requested code example. When the box is rotating you clearly see the corners of the box due to the lighting. If you could switch off the lighting these corners should disappear.p  precodeimport javafx.animation.Interpolator import javafx.animation.RotateTransition import javafx.application.Application import javafx.scene.Group import javafx.scene.PerspectiveCamera import javafx.scene.Scene import javafx.scene.SubScene import javafx.scene.image.Image import javafx.scene.layout.VBox import javafx.scene.paint.Color import javafx.scene.paint.PhongMaterial import javafx.scene.shape.CullFace import javafx.scene.shape.DrawMode import javafx.scene.shape.MeshView import javafx.scene.shape.TriangleMesh import javafx.scene.transform.Rotate import javafx.stage.Stage import javafx.util.Duration  public class SimplePanoViewer extends Application     private static final int VIEWPORTSIZE  1200    private static final double MODELSCALEFACTOR  VIEWPORTSIZE2    private static final String textureLoc  httpwww.flohmueller.depovtutbackgrndimCubemap22048x1536.jpg    private Image texture   private PhongMaterial texturedMaterial  new PhongMaterial    private MeshView meshView  loadMeshView    private MeshView loadMeshView       float[] points               0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,             0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,             0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,             0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,              0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,             0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,             0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,             0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f           float TX0  0f     float TX1  1f4f     float TX2  2f4f     float TX3  3f4f     float TX4  1f      float TY0  0f     float TY1  1f3f     float TY2  2f3f     float TY3  1f      float[] texCoords               TX0, TY1,             TX0, TY2,             TX1, TY2,             TX1, TY3,             TX2, TY3,             TX2, TY2,             TX3, TY2,             TX4, TY2,             TX4, TY1,             TX3, TY1,             TX2, TY1,             TX2, TY0,             TX1, TY0,             TX1, TY1,              int[] faces               0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 2,  5, 2, 4, 13, 0, 0,            0             4, 13, 5, 2, 6, 5,  6, 5, 7, 10, 4, 13,          1             7, 10, 6, 5, 2, 6,  2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 10,           2             3, 9, 2, 6, 1, 7,  1, 7, 0, 8, 3, 9,             3             0, 12, 4, 13, 7, 10,  7, 10, 3, 11, 0, 12,       4             5, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4,  2, 4, 6, 5, 5, 2              5           TriangleMesh mesh  new TriangleMesh     mesh.getPoints.setAllpoints     mesh.getTexCoords.setAlltexCoords     mesh.getFaces.setAllfaces      return new MeshViewmesh       private Group buildScene      meshView.setTranslateXVIEWPORTSIZE  2     meshView.setTranslateYVIEWPORTSIZE  2  9.0  16     meshView.setTranslateZVIEWPORTSIZE      meshView.setScaleXMODELSCALEFACTOR     meshView.setScaleYMODELSCALEFACTOR     meshView.setScaleZMODELSCALEFACTOR      return new GroupmeshView       Override   public void startStage stage      texture  new ImagetextureLoc     texturedMaterial.setDiffuseMaptexture      Group group  buildScene      RotateTransition rotate  rotate3dGroupgroup      meshView.setCullFaceCullFace.NONE     meshView.setDrawModeDrawMode.FILL     rotate.play     meshView.setMaterialtexturedMaterial      VBox layout  new VBox         createScene3Dgroup           stage.setTitleModel Viewer      Scene scene  new Scenelayout, Color.CORNSILK     stage.setScenescene     stage.show       private SubScene createScene3DGroup group      SubScene scene3d  new SubScenegroup, VIEWPORTSIZE, VIEWPORTSIZE  9.016     scene3d.setFillColor.rgb10, 10, 40     PerspectiveCamera camera  new PerspectiveCamera     scene3d.setCameracamera     return scene3d       private RotateTransition rotate3dGroupGroup group      RotateTransition rotate  new RotateTransitionDuration.seconds30, group     rotate.setAxisRotate.YAXIS     rotate.setFromAngle0     rotate.setToAngle360     rotate.setInterpolatorInterpolator.LINEAR     rotate.setCycleCountRotateTransition.INDEFINITE      return rotate       public static void mainString[] args      launchargs     codepre

As much as possible, I want keep everything with the same version, but Ive started from scratch and am documenting everything.  By default, yum would install MySQL 5.1.73.  I downloaded MySQL community v5.1.69 and installed it manually.  This required installing a shared compatibility package of MySQL v5.1.69 first, and removing mysqllibs.x8664.  With that in place, I successfully mirrored MySQL.p  pNow, Im trying to install Postfix.  Yum wants to pull version 2.6.66.  This fails because it requires a dependency that it attempts to install as well mysqllibs.x8664 v.5.1.735.  It splits out a pile of errors messages which are all similar to thisp  precodeTransaction Check Error   file usrsharemysqlcharsetsIndex.xml from install of mysqllibs5.1.735.el66.x8664 conflicts with file from package MySQLservercommunity5.1.691.rhel5.x8664 codepre  pMy old server is using postfix v2.6.62, which is apparently compatible with MySQL v5.1.69.  I found the rpm for that version of postfix.  It doesnt install, because it requires mysqllibs.  I cant install mysqllibs v.5.1.69, because it conflicts with the MySQL community edition also 5.1.69 that I installed.  I tried to install the MySQL 5.1.73 shared compatibility package, but that conflicts with MySQL community too.p  pIm going in circles.  Is the only way to break this chain to uninstall MySQL community Must I just use the v5.1.73 default, and the Postfix 2.6.66  I dont expect any real problems, but Im going to end up with slightly different versions of MySQL and Postfix then I am trying hard to mirror.p

Negative 1592 pI have a master SQL Server database hosted online which syncs and serves data to multiple clients who in turn work on the same data.  Some clients will be constantly connected to the internet and can sync immediately to the master, but other clients will have no access to the database for certain periods up to a few days at a time. I have a local MS Access database on each machine which is primarily worked on and which is to be synced back and to with the master when available and I am wondering how can I sync everything together and not lose any data Some clients wont be connected for days and might edit the same rows as constantly connected clients, how would I sync when connected to the internet to not lose data between them all p  pBecause of the incompatibility with MS Access files and the SQL server db, I have planned on bringing all data to DataTables and managing them like that before sending information back to the databases and because of this it would make sql server change tracking impossible.  I have heard of Microsofts Sync Framework but found nothing on it thus far.  I did think about manually storing executed statements locally on the computer and then executing them when connected to the internet but this could overwrite newer data with older data that never got the chance to be synced.  I am at a loss as to what to do and any help would be appreciated on how I could solve these problems.p  pThank you for your helpp

Negative 1592 pI am trying to build a recent copy of a hrefhttpsgithub.comTurfjsturfbuffer relnofollowturfbuffera which is a module of a hrefhttpsgithub.comTurfjsturf relnofollowturf.jsa. I ran codenpm install turfbuffercode and then codebrowserify turfbufferindex.js gt turf.jscode. However, upon including the resulting turf.js in the html file it is definitely there and calling codevar buffered  turf.bufferoriginalData, buf, meterscode I get the message codeturf is not definedcode. I have also tried codeturfjs.xxxcode, codeturfbuffer.xxxcode and various other combinations. If I try turfxxxx.yyy then I still get codeturf is not definedcode which suggests a fundamental turf object is missing. I presume this is a problem with the browserify build. Is there a flag I need to give to browserify or could it be a lack of packagespecific instructions p

Negative 1592 pIm using AngularJS. Due to some resources are heavy to get through the APIfrom hundreds to around a thousand objects contained in an array Im caching those in the frontend. p  pI have a html Table holding this information. Every row displays one of these objects from the cache and provides also selects options to modify certain fields from those objects. When you modify one of these fields, a request is done to the server to inform about changes done to the object. p  pOf course, there is a need to keep in sync the cache. If I bind the cache data to the table, changes will done to the cache with every action. If the server rejects one of those changes then the cache and server would be unsynched. Without having a copy of the object I would not be able to rollback.p  pWhat are best practices to keep in sync p  pMy solution has been to clone the cache and use this for the table. Changing fields will affect only the copy and a request will be made. Once the server is accepting the request then I updated the cache.p  pI see this approach prone to mistakes for a future. What I mean with prone to mistakes is basically when cloning the array. This is due to cloning has to be done carefully to really clone things and not get just a shallow copy. p  pIs there any other way more elegant to work in syncp  pI hope I have been able to explain well the issue.p

Negative 1592 pI have a codeJTablecode for which the renderer returns a codeJPanelcode composed of multiple codeJLabelcode instances. One of those codeJLabelcodes can contain HTML used among other things to split the output over multiple lines using codeltbrgtcode tags.p  pTo show the multiple lines in the table, the renderer calls in the codegetTableCellRendererComponentcode method p  precodetable.setRowHeightrow, componentToReturn.getPreferredSize.height codepre  pto dynamically update the row height, based on the contents.

Negative 1592 pIm new to the whole android app process and Im trying to get my head around a few things. I am creating a recipe app in which recipes will be retrieved from a MySQL database.
