Im using a notification with MAX priority to notify the user of an incoming call by setting a full screen pending intent on it to open the actual incoming call screen activity and two action buttons for AnswerReject. p  pIn some random  cases the notification does present itself, but without the actions. Swiping the notification with onetwo fingers does not expand the actions as is a suggested solution for some codeNotificationCompatcode mechanisms. They just arent there.

If the time the notification was created is 5pm it will say 5pm every time it fires, even if 30 minutes later the time is 530.p  pWhat do I need to do to make the alert body dynamicp  pI read in the docs it expects a string for alertBody so I am having trouble trying to figure out how to set the message body with a function call or a time stamp or a value that changes. p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiPhoneReferenceUILocalNotificationClassapplerefoccinstpUILocalNotificationalertBody relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiPhoneReferenceUILocalNotificationClassapplerefoccinstpUILocalNotificationalertBodyap  pBasically I want my app to calculate a value at the time the notification is about to fire, not at the time it is set, to create the message.

Negative 995 pIs there a simple and reliable way to determine the URL of the currentlyexecuting JavaScript file inside a web pagep  pMy only thought on this is to scan the DOM for all the script codesrccode attributes to find how the current file was referenced and then figure out the absolute URL by applying it to codedocument.locationcode.  Anyone have other ideas, is there some supereasy method I completely overlookedp  pUPDATE Script elements accessed via the DOM already have a codesrccode property which contains the full URL.  I dont know how ubiquitousstandard that is, but alternatively you can use codegetAttributesrccode which will return whatever raw attribute value is in the [X]HTML.p
Negative 995 pHas anyone succeeded to compile a Win32 GUI app with the command line dcc32.exe compiler, under 64bit Windows Vista, without installing Delphi 2009 On our system it fails, with a message that the DFM files contain unknown 16bit resources. This is usually an indication that the DFM files cannot be read. It works perfectly on all 32bit Vista and Windows XPs, that we tried.p  pI am asking, because we want to ensure that we can rebuild our current exe files later, if needed, so even if we all switch to 64bit OSes in the future, we want to be able to rebuild the old 2009 versions.p

Negative 995 pDear all,  I am starting to learn Delphi. So I decided to write an application like MS Excel from scratch. In a new Form1, I did put a TPageControl component containing only 1 page. In that page, I did put a TAdvStringGrid and a TPanel with some buttons button1, button2 and a Popup1 menu for defining some actions on the grid, like copy cell, copy row, delete row, etc. For that StringGrid, also, I have defined some properties, like colors, fonts, etc. I added a toolbar with a button to the main form, in order to add more pages to the PageControl. The OnClick method of that button defines two actionsbr  1 to add a new Page2 to the PageControl, and  2 to add a new StringGrid In the new created Page2 . p  pThat new runtime defined StringGrid created in a new Page of a Tpagecontrol should inherite get, copy, clone, duplicate the properties and methods of the StringGrid parent already defined in the first page at design time, and should be able to call the PopUp1 menu just like the StringGrid parent. How we do thisp  pAt the beginning, I thought I just should copy the StringGrid properties using assing, but when using this approach, the popup menu does not pop up when right mouse clicking on the new StringGrid... and the buttons button1 and button2 of Form1 only work with the first StringGrid but not with the new added one. I did read somewhere that in order to solve this problem, I could duplicate the StringGrid component by using the write and read TMemoryStream save the parent stringgrid into a memorystream, create a new stringgrid and then read that memorystream into the new created stringgrid, so I did, but when the program executes this component cloning method, I get a runtime error. p  pI did carefully chech the Help. Nothing found on that topic. Seems there is not any Delphi component library or third party components that cope with this kind of task. Can anybody help, please op

Negative 995 pI am working with some data I obtained that is read with a program using an embedded Advantage Database Server.  The program was not written by me and does not have all of the functionality that I need.  I would like to convert this data to a different format so that I can work with it more freely, such as MySQL.  p  pI know that Sybase provides some tools for converting a single local database into SQL, which is very nice.  This would work fine, except that the authors of this program create a new folder containing a new database for every new document that a users is working with.  So there could be 100s of separate database folders each with 100s of .ADT files in them.  p  pI am looking for a way to automate the process of converting these .ADT files and their schema to basically anything else.  Ive had more luck with almost all the other formats Ive had to work with in the past, this one has been most troublesome.  I dont need indexes, views, or any of that.  I only need to export the tables to another format so that I can process some of the data. p  pSo the solution Im looking for here is just a way to automate the conversion of a single Advantage Database Server local database to SQL.  So I have a folder of .ADT files that represent the  database.  p  pI included Ruby and Python in the tags because using one of these scripting languages would be ideal, but any solution would be great. p  pThe route Im on right now is trying to work with the ODBC drivers, but Im having trouble and hoped that there was an easier solution.p  pThanksp  pChase Grayp
Negative 995 phow to display multiple checkboxes value in ajax languagep
Negative 995 pI am about to implement the archetypal FileSystemWatcher solution.  I have a directory to monitor for file creations, and the task of sucking up created files and inserting the into a DB.  Roughly this will involve reading and processing 6 or 7, 80 char text files that appear at a rate of 150mS in bursts that occur every couple of seconds, and rarely a 2MB binary file will also have to be processed.  This will most likely be a 247 process.p  pFrom what I have read about the FileSystemWatcher object it is better to enqueue its events in one thread and then dequeueprocess them in another thread.  The quandary I have right now is what would be the better creation mechanism of the thread that does the processing.  The choices I can see arep  ol lipEach time I get a FSW event I manually create a new thread yeah I know .. stupid architecture, but I had to say it.pli lipThrow the processing at the CLR thread pool whenever I get an FSW eventpli lipOn start up, create a dedicated second thread for the processing and use a producerconsumer model to handle the work. The main thread enqueues the request and the second thread dequeues it and performs the work.pli ol  pI am tending towards the third method as the preferred one as I know the work thread will always be required  and also probably more so because I have no feel for the thread pool.p

In these cases I have changed the connection string to use the credentials of a SQL Server users instead. I would prefer to not have a hard coded  username and password in the connection string or rather worse in code.p  pIs it possible to use forms authentication just for user authentication for users and windows authentication with the IIS user for database access What would be the best practice in such a situation p
Negative 995 pI have written a WordPress plugin, and I am trying to find the best way of having the program check for updates on my server, and downloading them automatically at the users request.  This will basically be used to download extra features that I dont want to put into the WordPress repository due them not having the GNU license. p  pIve coded the program to check for updates, what I am not sure about is the download part. p  pShould I use filegetcontents and then fwrite to write the results to a directory  Im sure thats a way of doing it, but I am looking for the most crossserver safe way of doing this because the plugin is used by thousands of people on different setups, although they are all PHP, and most of them are PHP5.  I am afraid certain hosts may have some sort of security preventing me from doing this.  Would cURL be a better optionp  pThank you.p

Then theres also the fact that CityGML actually inherits a lot from GML, so imports from GML .xsd files are also necessary.p  pSo far, in terms of C class generation, Ive tried two approaches, both using the classic xsd.exe  the creation of a single .cs file which will include all the CityGML classes I need  a single command linep  precodexsd gmlfeature.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd gmlgeometryBasic2d.xsd gmlgeometryComplexes.xsd gmlgeometryPrimitives.xsd gmlsmil20.xsd     gmlsmil20language.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd citygmlappearance.xsd citygmlbuilding.xsd citygmlcityFurniture.xsd citygmlcityObjectGroup.xsd     citygmlgenerics.xsd citygmllandUse.xsd citygmlrelief.xsd citygmltexturedSurface.xsd citygmltransportation.xsd citygmlvegetation.xsd     citygmlwaterBody.xsd citygmlCityGML.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd classes fields namespaceCityGML   the creation of a .cs file for each of the CityGML modules  one command line for each module  xsd citygmlxAL.xsd classes namespacexAL oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLBase oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlappearance.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLAppearance oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlbuilding.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLBuilding oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlcityFurniture.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLCityFurniture oout  xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd gmlfeature.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd citygmlcityObjectGroup.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLCityObjectGroup oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlgenerics.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLGenerics oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmllandUse.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLLandUse oout  xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlcityFurniture.xsd gmlcoverage.xsd citygmlrelief.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLRelief oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmltexturedSurface.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLTexturedSurface oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryComplexes.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmltransportation.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLTransportation oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd  gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlvegetation.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLVegetation oout  xsd gmlfeature.xsd citygmlcityGMLBase.xsd citygmlxAL.xsd gmlgeometryAggregates.xsd gmlxlinks.xsd citygmlwaterBody.xsd classes namespaceCityGMLWaterBody oout codepre  pFor each of the commands, the last .xsd is the desired module, while the others are necessary imports.p  pUnfortunately, though xsd.exe deals with imports from other .xsd files and it creates classes of the required file as well as from the imported files, it does this quite directly, stacking all of these classes in one .cs file. Apparently theres no way to separate the desired classes from the imported classes in different .cs files.

Negative 995 pI am prototyping a new system in Python the functionality is mostly numerical.p  pAn important requirement is the ability to use different linear algebra backends from individual user implementations to generic libraries, such as Numpy. The linear algebra implementation that is, the backend must be independent from the interface.p  pMy initial architectural attempt is as followsp  h31 Define the system interfaceh3  precodegtgtgt v1  Vector[1,2,3] gtgtgt v2  Vector[4,5,6] gtgtgt print v1  v2 gtgtgt  prints Vector[4, 10, 18] codepre  h32 Implement the code allowing to use that interface independently of the backendh3  precode this example uses numpy as the backend, but I mean  to do this for a general backend import numpy  def numpyarrayargs  creates a numpy array from the arguments     return numpy.arrayargs  class VectorBasetype     def initcls, name, bases, attrs         engine  attrs.popengine, None         if not engine             raise RuntimeErroryou need to specify an engine          this implementation would change depending on engine         def newcls, args             return numpyarrayargs            setattrcls, new, classmethodnew  class Vectorobject        metaclass  VectorBase              I could change this at run time      and offer alternative backends     engine  numpy       classmethod     def createcls, v         nv  cls         nv.v  v         return nv         def initself, args           self.v  None         if args             self.v  self.newargs     def reprself         l  [item for item in self.v]         return Vectors  reprl     def mulself, other         try             return Vector.createself.v  other.v         except AttributeError             return Vector.createself.v  other     def rmulself, other         return self.mulother codepre  pThis simple example works as follows the codeVectorcode class keeps a reference to a vector instance made by the backend codenumpy.ndarraycode in the example all arithmetic calls are implemented by the interface, but their evaluation is deferred to the backend.p  pIn practice, the interface overloads all the appropriate operators and defers to the backend the example only shows codemulcode and codermulcode, but you can follow that the same would be done for every operation. p  pI am willing to loose some performance in exchange of customizability. Even while my example works, it does not feel right  I would be crippling the backend with so many constructor calls This begs for a different codemetaclasscode implementation, allowing for a better call deferment. p  pSo, how would you recommend that I implement this functionality I need to stress the importance of keeping all of the systems codeVectorcode instances homogeneous and independent of the linear algebra backend.p

Below is just a snippet of my codep  precodebyte[] pic int picsize Bitmap picframe public void onPreviewFramebyte[] frame, Camera c      picsize  mCamera.getParameters.getPreviewSize.height  mCamera.getParameters.getPreviewSize.width     pic  new byte[picsize]     forint i  0 i lt picsize i              pic[i]  frame[i]          picframe  BitmapFactory.decodeByteArraypic, 0, picsize  codepre  pThe first [widthheight] values of the byte[] frame array are the luminance greyscale values. Once Ive extracted them, how do I display them on the screen as an image Its not a 2D array as well, so how would I specify the width and height Thanks for any help.p

Negative 995 pIf I use UNION for a subform recordset in Access, it disallows making that recordset updateable.p  pThe problem is, I need to be able to update the recordset.p  pI have two tables  One is a list of employees Employees.

As a result, that table INCTech uses EmployeeID and Date as a joint primary key, since each employee can only have one record for a given date.p  pI cant use a LEFT OUTER JOIN to retrieve a complete list of employees, because it will exclude any employee that has a record in INCTech for a date other than the given date.

So in other words I have a employee model, and a corresponding employee ViewModel. Now when the user clicks New Employee brings up a window that has 4 things 2 combo boxes and and employee name field and a submit button. Now my main focus is on how do I manage the 2 combo boxes, one being for company and one for departmentp  pNow I also have two models for company and department and viewmodels, respectively, because I need to be able to add new a company or department. p  pSo my first question boils down to the fact that do I used the company and department models in the Employee Viewmodel, or do I bind the drop down boxes to the separate viewmodel for company or department If so how would i get the combo box details then, if done the second wayp  pAnd my second is if you bind a datagrid to a, lets say, EmployeeListViewModel, if any changes occur in the list in employeelistviewmodel, does that datagrid automatically update or do I have to call a function that rechecks the list or do i have to rebind itp  pAny help would be great p  pThanks allp

But I really would like to save the selectedPosition of each Spinner in the sharedPreferences and this is where Im stucking in a ForceClose Desaster...p  pIn my understanding, every Spinner gets an ID when created so you can save the Position bounded on this ID in the preferences.p  pSo this is what I didp  precodepublic void addSpinner      LinearLayout AddLayout  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.linearAddScroll     spinner  new Spinnerthis     ArrayAdapterltgt adapt  ArrayAdapter.createFromResourcethis,             R.array.Filter, android.R.layout.simplespinneritem     adapt.setDropDownViewResourceandroid.R.layout.simplespinnerdropdownitem     spinner.setAdapteradapt     AddLayout.addViewspinner      codepre  pthis creates the Spinner.p  precodepublic void onClickView v              addSpinner               int ID  1000x             spinner.setIdID             Toast.makeTextMatReporterActivity.this,ID  ID, 5             .show             x          codepre  pset the ID.p  pThis is what I do in the on Create methodp  precodex  settings.getIntxsave, 1     fory  1 y lt x y         addSpinner          int ID  1000y         Spinner s  Spinner findViewByIdID          String ys Integer.toStringID         Toast.makeTextMatReporterActivity.this,ID ys, 5         .show         int yf  settings.getIntys, 1         s.setSelectionyf          codepre  pAnd this onStopp  precodeSharedPreferences settings  PreferenceManager             .getDefaultSharedPreferencesthis     SharedPreferences.Editor editor  settings.edit     editor.putIntxsave, x     fory  1 y lt x y         int ID  1000y         Spinner s2 Spinner findViewByIdID         int possS  s2.getSelectedItemPosition         Toast.makeTextMatReporterActivity.this, IDStop  ID, 5         .show         String ys Integer.toStringID         editor.putIntys, possS           editor.commit  codepre  pI think there is a logical Problem in the onCreate Method, but Im not able to find it, also I didnt find any help in the web how to populate and save dynamically created spinners.p  pSo maybe someone has an idea. thanks.p

Negative 995 pGreetings stackoverflow.p  pRecently, Im tracing the Bluetooth operating mechanism in Android framework. Ive notice that theres some file type limitation which is made by a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformpackagesappsBluetoothfb946935fe50d957e835ac00a592bd3d222edef3 relnofollowthis patcha while receiving files via OPP.p  pin package codecom.android.bluetooth.oppcode , theres a fixed white list in Constants.javap  precode   The MIME types of we could accept from other device.   This is in essence a white list of acceptable types.   Today, restricted to images, audio, video and certain text types.   public static final String[] ACCEPTABLESHAREINBOUNDTYPES  new String[]       ... some types such as images and music ...   codepre  pwhich limits the acceptable file types in BluetoothOppObexServerSession.javap  precode         Reject policy anything outside the white list plus unspecified          MIME Types.         if prereject             ampamp mimeType  null  Constants.mimeTypeMatchesmimeType,                     Constants.ACCEPTABLESHAREINBOUNDTYPES          if D Log.wTAG, mimeType is null or in unacceptable list, reject the transfer         prereject  true         obexResponse  ResponseCodes.OBEXHTTPUNSUPPORTEDTYPE codepre  pWhat makes us concern about the MIME type in this situation In my knowledge, we may like to block the executable files i.e. .apk, .so since those files may harm our device. If blocking some specific types is the reason we set a list here, why would we use a white list instead of a black list just before this patch Is there some similar limitation when we transmit files via other nonbluetooth protocol such as HTTPp

Negative 995 pI just have a question which way gives me more performance and would be easier to get done. We have a DB with over 120000 datarows which is stored in a database. These data is currently exported as CSV file to an ftp location.p  pNow from this csv file there should be a webform created to filter the datasets. What would you recommend regarding performance and work todo. Should I parse the csv file and get the information out to the webpage or should I reimport the csv file to a DB MySQL and use SQL queries to filter the data Note The original DB and export is on a different server than the webpagewebform.p  pA direct connection to the DB on the original server is not possible. I prefer reuploading it to a DB, because it makes the development easier, I just simply need to create the SQL query against the filter criteria entered in the webform and run it.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks...

Negative 995 pI have been trying to figure this little section of my larger project out for a while now. It has stumped me pretty well too... I am trying to take information from an Excel CSV File See Example.CSV and have it input into the Cpp project.. Now before I get to the way I have been working on it, I thought I might first run some other ways by ya guys and see which you thought would be most efficient p  p1 Example1.csv Item Values still following the codesSwordName, lvlReq, minAtk, maxAtk, atkRate, sPrice, sValue, strReq, atkReq, intReqcode. Column Headers as shown in Example.csv.. Would it be ideal to make like a header that pulls Item Information from the CSV file when told to, For example If the player is at a shop, he wants to appraise his sword. When he clicks on the value button, it searches the Sword.csv file for the item IDMaybe and will return the 5th, given the value of the 5th column in that items row is the Value its worth.. And just create some kind of function that does that for everything If so, any ideas how to do that.p  p2 The main way I have been trying to get this to work in Example.csv I have all the items values I use in my program.. They are assigned to int and char variables, at least thats my goal.. Please direct to Example.cpp for my fail code and explanation..p  pExample.cppp  precode    include stdafx.h     include ltcstdlibgt     include ltfstreamgt     include ltiosgt     include ltiomanipgt     include ltiostreamgt     include ltsstreamgt     include ltstringgt     include ltsstreamgt      using namespace std       These are the Variables I use for a weapon, they corrospond according to number in list Wooden Shortsword is first in the       sSwordName Array, so its lvl requirment would be 1 since it is first.       Idealy this is the way I want things to work... Unless anyone has a better idea, I am open to hear them. I can always       learn more, especially from others.      char sSwordName[10][25]    Wooden Shortsword, Bronze Shortsword, Iron Shortsword, Steel Shortsword, Titanium Shortsword     int sSwordLvlR[10]     1, 3, 5, 6, 10     int sSwordV[10]        5, 10, 18, 25, 50     int sSwordP[10]        10, 20, 40, 60, 100     int sSwordMinAtk[10]   0, 0, 0, 0, 0     int sSwordMaxAtk[10]   4, 6, 10, 14, 20     int sSwordAtkRate[10]  0, 2, 3, 4, 6     int sSwordStrR[10]     1, 6, 11, 16, 22     int sSwordAtkR[10]     1, 6, 11, 16, 22     int sSwordIntR[10]     1, 3, 5, 8, 12       Now this is as close as I have been able to get to get this to work, sadly it is still off base...       I need it to take for example Row 1 gt Exclude Column 1 gt Input Data gt Assign to sSwordName[5][25] Array.       My issue is, finding a way to loop it where it takes all the cells in Row 1, ignores the first cell        I think making it do like n for it would work Not sure and then loop through the rest of the rows       repeating the same algorithm, Ignoring the first cell, inputting, assinging them to the variable arrays       It is much much easier to edit item stats and add new items in Excel, than having to do it via code as you       may imagine..       I am pretty sure my code is far from what would be best, I bet it needs to be rewritten a new way as well..       I would greatly appreciate Anyone who can help me accomplish this task..

Negative 995 pI have never asked a forum question before so if Im breaking a rule its unintentional and Im sorry.p  pI have a webapp that I am making using scalalift and jetty in the IntelliJ Idea IDE.  I have a javascript debug webapp that I designed for .net frame work although all I used the .net server for was to serve it because it runs strictly in in html and javascript.  I want to use my debug tool for pages that are served by the liftscalajetty server and I am currently porting it so that it will work on the new server.  The problem that I am having is that the html pages in my debug tool import external javascript files like sop  precodeltscript type  textjavascript src  jsFile.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pnow this seemed to work at first but when I made changes to the src javascript file they were not happening in the page that was served by lift.  I verified this by following the link in the view page source page from the browser and it showed the version of the file before I added it into the project.  If I change the name of the file in the file system the IDE recognizes right away that it cant resolve the path to jsFile.js.  I have tried serving the pages through the site map as well as dumping my project in the static directory.  I have restarted, browser,ide, server, os.  I have rebuilt the project, remade the module and have done a synchronize.  I have created a new project from scatch and ran into the same problem.  I believe that if I where to dynamically use lift to insert my javascript with JsRaw it would fix the problem but I still want to know why this isnt working in case its something that Im doing wrong that will rear up bite me again someday.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 995 pIm curious whether anyone has written a git extension that handles discussions related to the repository inside the repository itself.

Lets say I am implementing a gallery, and I want to have pretty URLs using modrewrite. So, I would like to have URLs as followsp  precodehttpwww.mydomain.comsomedirgalleriescats codepre  pwhich shows thumbnails of cats, whilep  precodehttpwww.mydomain.comsomedirgalleriescatspersian codepre  pwhich shows one image from the thumbnails of all cats, named persian. So in actual fact the physical directory structure and rewriting would be as followsp  precodehttpwww.domain.comsomedirgallery.phpcategorycatsampimagepersian codepre  pSo what I want to do is put a .htaccess file in somedir which catches all requests made to galleries and depending on the virtual subdirectories following it, use them as placeholders in the rewriting, with 2 rewrite rulesp  precodeRewriteRule galleriesAZ09] .gallery.phpcategory1 [nc] RewriteRule galleriesAZ09][AZ09]  .gallery.phpcategory1ampimage2 [nc] codepre  pNow the problem is that the gallery script in fact needs some CSS, Javascript and Images, located at a hrefhttpwww.domain.comsomedircsshttpwww.domain.comsomedircssa, a hrefhttpwww.domain.comsomedirjshttpwww.domain.comsomedirjsa, and a hrefhttpwww.domain.comsomedirimageshttpwww.domain.comsomedirimagesa respectively. p  pI dont want to hardcode any absolute URLs, so the CSS, JS and Images will be referred to using relative URLs, .css, .js, .images etc.. So I can do rewriting URLs as followsp  precodeRewriteRule galleries[AZ09]css. .css1 [nc] codepre  pThe problem is that since a hrefhttpwww.domain.comsomedirgalleriescatshttpwww.domain.comsomedirgalleriescatsa is a virtual directory, the above only works if the user typesp  precodehttpwww.domain.comsomedirgallariescats codepre  pIf the user omits the trailing slash moddir will not add it because in actual fact this directory does not actually exist.p  pIf I put a redirect rewrite with the absolute URL it worksp  precodeRewriteRule galleries[AZ09] httpwww.mydomain.comsubdirgalleries1 [R,nc,L] codepre  pBut I dont want to have the URL prefix hardcoded because I want to be able to put this on whatever domain I want in whatever subdir I want, so I tried thisp  precodeRewriteRule galleries[AZ09] galleries1 [R,nc,L] codepre  pBut instead it redirects top  precodehttpwww.mydomain.comhomemyaccountpublichtmlsubdirgalleriestheRest codepre  pwhich obviously is not what I want.p  pstrongEDITstrong Further clarificationsp  pThe solution I am looking for is to avoid hardcoding the domain name or folder paths in .htaccess. I am looking for a solution where if I package the .htaccess with the rest of the scripts and resources, wherever the user unzips it on his web server it works out of the box. All works like that apart from this trailing slash issue.p  pSo any solution which involves hardcoding the parent directory or the webservers path in .htaccess in any way is not what I am looking for. p

Negative 995 pSince Index Rebuilds will update statistics data for the concerned indexes with full scan, so it is not advisable to update statistics on those indexes using the Update Statistics with default sample size. This will worsen the statistics data captured. In that case, when we are doing a statistics update operation on all the tables in the database, is it a correct strategy to eliminate those indexes from the update process for which the indexes are already up to datebased on the assumption that we are running the Index rebuilds before the statistics update. For example, lets say that I am using the following cursor to get a list of all indexes in the DB for which update is requiredp  precodeSET indexnames  CURSOR LOCAL FASTFORWARD READONLY FOR     SELECT NAME ,indid ,rowmodctr     FROM sys.sysindexes         WHERE id  tableid         AND indid gt 0     ORDER BY indid codepre  pand use the following condition to check if we need to update statisticsp  precodeIF indrowmodctr ltgt 0 codepre  pBut this will update statistics for all the indexes irrespective of whether an index already has its statistics updated due to a rebuild.p  pNow assuming that we are running the Index Rebuild task and the statistics update task on the same day and in that order, can we use the following filter to eliminate the indexes which has already been rebuiltp  precodeSELECT NAME AS indexname     ,CONVERTVARCHAR10, STATSDATEobjectid, indexid, 111 AS statisticsupdatedate FROM sys.indexes WHERE objectid  OBJECTIDCMProject     AND CONVERTVARCHAR10, STATSDATEobjectid, indexid, 111 ltgt CONVERTVARCHAR10, GETDATE, 111 codepre  pIf this not a correctoptimal way to achieve this, can you please suggest a standard way to get this done.p  pThanks.

Negative 995 pI just started storing user uploaded images on Amazons S3. Its pretty nice because it took care of my storage problem. However, I am struggling when it comes to having the browser cache the images.p  pI am using djangostorages.

I am doing that and getting no results.p  pBasically when the app requests the images, I get a 200 EVERY TIME. ARG... when I take the browser straight to the image copy and paste the link into a new window I get a 200 then a 304 every time after that.p  pIts very frustrating because it re downloads the image every time.

Negative 995 pI am currently trying to create an sqlite database where I can import a table from another sqlite database cant attach and add some extra data to each column.p  pSince there is no codeINSERT OR UPDATEcode I came up with thisbr I was thinking about splitting the data into two tables and join them afterwards so I can just dump the whole import into one table replacing everything that changed and manage the extra data separately since that does not change on import.p  pThe first table lets call it codebasedatacode would look likep  precodelocalid  remoteid  basedata1  basedata2  ...  codepre  pbesides the codelocalidcode everything would just be a mirror of the remote database Ill probably add a sync timestamp but that does not matter now.p  pThe second table would look similar but has coderemoteidcode set as foreign keyp  precoderemoteid  extradata1  extradata2  ...

It does not work if I wrap codeINSERT OR REPLACEcode in a transaction either. Its always deleting my extra data although the same foreign key exists after the statement.p  pIs it possible to stop codeON DELETEcode to trigger until the codeINSERT OR REPLACEcode is finished Maybe some special transaction mode  pragma p

It works pretty well it generates a square wave with a period of about 40ms. Using an oscilloscope it looks like the standard deviation is about 10 microseconds when the computer is idle. When the computer is not idle the standard deviation becomes much larger. I think this is because more context switches happen and Threads stay too long in the waiting state and the specified 20 ms is not achieved accurately.p  pIs there a way to make my implementation more accurate I know I could use hardware for this but I want to know if I can do this with software too.p  pWould an option be to listen to a clock and perform an action timed to the millisecondp

Negative 995 pI have written an application in Java on my windows machine and want to package it for my Mac. I am aware of JarBundler, and initially I thought it would be perfect because I was going to obfuscate the code.jarcode with ProGaurd anyway, however when I obfuscate the application I run into problems on Mac with the codeAboutHandlercode and codeQuitHandlercode.p  pI have been looking around and I noticed the there is no code.jarcode file in the Eclipse IDE code.appcode, even though I am lead to believe it was written in Java, and so this seems to be what I need. The only problem is I have no idea how it is done, and I was hoping one of you could guide me please. I have read that Mac users do tend to have a different mindset and applications dont tend to get hacked as much, and I know that it will still take a decompiler to read the source however, if I can do something like this I would rather like to. For me, anything I can do to help to prevent people reading the source code is a merit, the only problem is for some reason obfuscation isnt playing ballp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 995 pSo, Im making a customized installer for a project of mine, and what I needed was to pack everything in one file. I couldnt use ILMerge or .NETZ because one of the things I had to include was an unmanaged was that how it was called assembly. Anyways, I read a lot of stuff mainly from here, and people were saying to do thisp  ul liAdd the .dll as an Embedded Resource li liAdd a handler to the AssemblyResolve method so it fires up when my application cant find the assemblyli liIn that handler, make it load the .dll from memory using a function that transfers the input stream into a byte array which the Assembly.Load can use.li ul  pI did all that stuff and I added a normal reference to the .dll, so my code can compile properly. However, when I delete the .dll file from the directory where the application is, and try to run it, the Failed to load file or assembly... dialog or whatever it was, you know what Im talking about pops up and tells me that it couldnt load my .dll, although I explicitly told it to load it from that byte array in the AssemblyResolve EventHandler.br Im sorry if this is something which has been answered before. Looking at the recommended similar questions, I cant see an answer to this, though.br The only thing I could see that might be related is that C would not allow me to load from bytes, unless Im in a highsecurity context. If anyone knows anything, can you please confirmdeny this statement, and tell me what a highsecurity context is I admit, Im a noober at complicated stuff. p  pThanks in advance for your time and answersp

Negative 995 pThe scenario Im having problems with is as followsp  ol liCode First model created using EF 4.1 and corresponding database generatedli liEF upgraded to 4.3.1 and a migration added using IgnoreChanges because no model changes to start using migrations MigrtionHistory table created and EdmMetadata dropped  lets call it InitialMigrationli liModel is changed, say a new property is added and a migration that adds a corresponding column is generated lets call this one NewPropertyMigration and then applied to a Dev database using our version of Migrate To Latest initialization strategyli liWhen code is promoted to production the database there is updated with new column as expectedli liThen when a brand new database is created in Dev and because it is based on latest model it will include the new column right after it is created but when the initialization strategy is run it still finds InitialMigration and NewPropertyMigration as pending but they both fail because EdmMetadata is not there so nothing to be removed and new column is already there so cant addli ol  pWhen I check MigrationHistory table on this new database it only contains InitialCreate entry so that would explain why the other two migrations are considered as pending. But I cant see how they would ever get into this table without being applied and at the same time they dont really need to be applied because database already contains any changes they cover. What am I missing p  pIll just add that it seems a bit suspicious that the Model column in InitialCreate is different to the one in NewPropertyMigration even though they represent the same model.

Negative 995 pMost of my questions are theoretical in nature since I think Great minds discuss Ideas and clerks discuss syntax.p  pAnyways.. so here is the situationp  pI have a system which take input from user.BUT none of that input is used in queries at all. This input contain a lot of code snippets. Now in the past i escaped the input and then stored it in database. I do not use adding and stripping slashes functions of any sort rather use my own procedures which use pregreplace like followingp  precodedata  pregreplace, amp59, data data  pregreplacelt, amplt,   data data  pregreplacegt, ampgt,   data data  pregreplace, ampquot,data data  pregreplace, amp40, data codepre  pHowever following problems occurred.p  pAt times the software will escape the data wrongly since my software is not bug free and I will have no way of finding what the actual data was. From time to time I update my escaping procedures and that means different inputs are escaped differently.p  pthe user has an option to EDIT his post. thus it means that i have to present him the escaped data or un escape the data to prevent escaping a data twice...... SO finally i have come to the conclusion that I save unescaped data from user directly into database. and escape it before Display it has no other purpose.. no use in query etc. for any thing else i have the original data un changed.p  pMy Questionsp  pCan un escaped user data in database still be  dangerous even when not used in queries or escaped before displayp  pIs Escaping with slashes equal  better different than escaping by chaging characters eg lt into lt..p  pIf the data is properly escaped  i mean all special characters can it still be used for XSS attack. SQL injection is out of question.p

Negative 995 pi am working on a spreadsheettable has collapsible rows so that you can hideshow data by clicking on a small image. I have all of this working well using JQuery and Ruby on Rails. p  pWhat I now need to do is save the layout of the table so that it persists through page loads. I understand I could do this via Ajax, writing to the database every time a user clicks a button to showhide rows, but not sure this is the best approach. I dont think using cookies is a good approach for me either since layout should persist across browserssessions.p  pWhat Im thinking of doing is thisadding hidden form fields to the page. each hidden field corresponds to one of the showhide buttons. So, each time a button is clicked it could update via jquery the hidden fields value to truefalse depending on whether the row is expanded or not. Then when the user saves the form I could use Rails to save the hidden field values to a hash in the databasep  precodespreadsheet.layout  row1expand gt true, row8expand gt false codepre  pIm looking for advise on best way to save layout so when the spreadsheet is viewed again it looks the same as it did when last saved. Is creating an extra field named layout to save a hash of values a good approach And using hidden fields set via Jquery Im open to any suggestions, thanks.p

Negative 995 pI have to preface this question by saying that Im aware that hardcoding a password in the client application is bad practice, for many reasons. There are other questions dealing with that issue. The scope of this question is narrower and assumes that authenticating credentials HAVE to reside on the client applications code for some set of reasons that are out of your control.p  pIf some ways are better than others for instance JPasswordField stores the password in a char array instead of a String and if you had to hard code it in the Java application, what measures could you take to make it harder to be fetchedp  pUpdatep  pOne instance of the application runs on a remote pc, where the end user has admin rights. The credentials are used to access a database in the same network, so the actual password is already predetermined and must be entered manually in the actual code.p

Negative 995 pCan anyone validate this approach Im very new to ESBs so struggling with the best approach to what to me seems a very complex flow. I am using WSO2 ESB Apache Synapse.p  pUse casep  ol liRead in cvs file with simple two columns.  li liFor each line take one of the values and pass to a lookup service ldap to retrieve more data li litake one of the values for each line from retrieved data and lookup to another webserviceli licombine all lines into one message then submit resulting message to external web serviceli ol  pThoughts so far are to for 1 use vfs and smooks to parse csv. This appears to be straightforward and I have got to the point where I can create a separate xml message within an iterate mediator to deal with each line. Then for 2 pass each line to custom mediator to do the ldap lookup. For 3 take that result and use one of the elements to pass to a callout mediator which gets a value back basically doing a enum lookup then 4 dont know havent got that far.p  pSo far the solution to 3 looks very complicated. The Callout mediator is expecting a message that is the full webservice message which is totally different from what the line xml looks like. I could use xslt to transform it to the correct input to webservice, but the result is the full ws response  I can get the value Im interested in using property mediator but dont know how to insert it back into the message.p  pAll in all, this seems like not very suited to an esb but intuitively seems the way I should be doing it. I could of course just write this all in Java but a lot of the bits appear to be there in esb.p  pSo, any advice Really happy to continue working through the detail but not if it is the wrong one. p  pthanks Conradp

Negative 995 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11777586customizextableThis existing questiona covers a way to alternate row colors in a latex table by postprocessing the output from codeprint.xtablecode, but I think its possible to achieve the same thing by using the codeadd.to.rowcode argument of codeprint.xtablecode as described on a hrefhttpstats.stackexchange.coma7953stats.stackexchangea, avoiding the need for postprocessing, which is nice with Sweave. That answer deals with coloring the background of one specific row, but I think it can be extended to coloring all the odd rows.p  pThe problem Im running into has to do with the codeadd.to.rowcode argument, making the length of list codeposcode equal the length of character vector codecommandcode.

The first component which should             be called pos is a list contains the position of rows on             which extra commands should be added at the end, The second             component which should be called command is a character             vector of the same length of the first component which             contains the command that should be added at the end of the             specified rows.

Is there anyway I can set a seperate css condition for firefox or another way because it looks silly.p  pI have tried using height 100 but I cant use this because I have javascript and other stuff which is hidden and fades in and other reasons.p  precodecontainer           [disabled]overflow hidden              paddingtop 10px         paddingright 20px         paddingbottom 20px         paddingleft 20px          [disabled]float left          width 960px         marginleft auto         marginright auto            body           [disabled]marginright auto           [disabled]marginleft auto           [disabled]width 1010px          fontsize 11px         fontfamily lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sansserif         color3F3F3F         backgroundcolor F3F3F3         margintop 20px         overflowauto          [disabled]float left       codepre
Negative 995 pI am writing a code in C which has the following basic structurep  pPart A StartingInit of the main module, calling of various submodules and final compliation of the results from the submodules.p  pPart B Actual execution of the submodules.p  precodeNow, part A has its own main.c and main.h file Part B has three modules  sub1.csub1.h sub2.csub2.h sub3.csub3.h codepre  pThere are a lot of common variables and functions that are used in the submodules. I would like to have a common module which could be included in all the submodules and all the common functionsvariables be used. common.c and common.hp  pNow, for the common functions, I can declare them in common.h and then define in common.c and then they could directly be used in all the submodules. But there are a lot of common data variablesmembers also which i want to common out.p  pWhat would be the most efficient way of doing this, so that i could directly use them in all the submodulesp  pIn c, it could just be added to common.h and then could be used with any file  that includes common.h but i believe that it is a little different in c.  Could someone please help explain the differencep  pthanksp

Negative 995 pI am looking for a way to organize the interface following the rougelike pattern term borrowed from emThe Art of Unix Programmingem by Eric S.

There is a main window object which processes keystrokes and invokes actions. If a new screen was opened say, options screen, the main window delegates the keystrokes to an appropriate OptionsWindow object. The view part was kind of mixed with a controller part of the application.p  pI would really like to know the proper, oo design of a rougelike app interface. How to organize my screens windows In which component should I process the keystrokes What about things common to all the windows moving focus, etc.p

Negative 995 pMy application requires client authentication for a specific URL, after client authentication succeeds the application itself also does some verification on the client certificate subject using spring security x509 filter. I wanted to configure tomcat to force client authentication clientAuthtrue for the specific URL, but based on this post it seems I cant do this only using tomcat  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14937833configuretomcatforclientauthenticationonlyforspecificurlpatternsconfigure tomcat for client authentication only for specific URL patternsa.p  pMy question is, if I use clientAuthwant, will the following be as below when the server requests a certificatep  ol liIf device has an identity certificate but not trusted by the CA configured in tomcat truststoreFile, no certificate will be passed and the request will fail in the spring security filter certificate will be nullli liIf device has an identity certificate trusted by the CA configured in tomcat truststoreFile, but is invalid not sure what validations are done or expired, either the authentication will fail in tomcat before the security filter or as in option 1 no certificate will be passed and the request will fail in the spring security filter certificate will be nullli ol  pIs there a security hole I may be missing using this configuration of want  security filter I guess the question is  if a certificate is eventually passed from the device to the server, the server will always validate it not expired, trusted etc even when using clientAuthwant and will not allow the client to continue if the certificate is invalid The case where no certificate is passed is covered by the security filter that will check the certificate is not null..p  pThanksp

Negative 995 pIm messing around with canvas, and starting by reading a bunch of game loop snippetsposts and combining them into the best one possible. p  pI came upon this snippet today its part way through a hrefhttpnokarma.org20110202javascriptgamedevelopmentthegameloopindex.html relnofollowa posta, so they make further iterations on it later. But Im integrating the ideas as I go, but its perplexing me a little.p  precodeGame.run       function          var loops  0         var skipTicks  1000  Game.fps         var maxFrameSkip  10         var nextGameTick  new Date.getTime          return function              loops  0              while new Date.getTime gt nextGameTick ampamp loops lt maxFrameSkip                  Game.update                 nextGameTick  skipTicks                 loops                           Game.draw                 Game.intervalId  setIntervalGame.run, 1000  Game.fps codepre  pSo codeGame.runcode gets assigned the result of the outer function, which is the inside function. But the inside function relies on codenextGameTickcode, which is defined in the outer function...p  pSo will this game be keeping its state in the outer anonymous function If so, any ideas why they did thatp  pAnd as for e.g. codeloopscode, which is set to 0 every call, is it declared outside to avoid redeclaring the variable again each time p
Negative 995 pI have an event driven app that I was tasked with maintaining. About 100 events run every 30 seconds, on separate timers. Over time the events alias into a constant stream of about 13 events per second. Memory usage does not appear dependent on the number of events firing in any given second. Each event polls data from a Webservice, checks the data using a LINQ2SQL DataContext against the previously polled data I do not dispose or null out the DataContext when done, and if the data is different, updates the database and pushes the new data as an XML message to receiver service via TCP.p  pThis app appears to have a memory leak which p  ol lionly manifests after 30m of running either debug or releaseli liwont manifest when profiling [Im using .NET Memory Profiler 4.5]li ol  pCharacteristics  On startup the program uses 30MB. As time progresses this Memory usage in Task Manager will begin pogoing, first only slightly, between 50 and 150MB, and eventually gets worse, oscillating between 200MB and 1GB. When this happens, it happens a few times within a second or two, then settles down at 150MB for the next 1020 or so seconds. p  pIve been trying to catch this behavior in action using memory profiling. So far Ive been unsuccessful, I cant get the app to pogo or oscillate in memory usage anywhere near like I can when the profiler isnt watching. However, Ive been noticing a squarewave sort of pattern on the memory usage as the Garbage Collector stages 1 and 2 run that looks very similar to what I see in Task Manager, except the memory usage oscillations in the squarewave are 10MB wide, instead of 800MB 200MB to 1GB. Now, according to Google Images, Garbage collection in a properly functioning app looks more like a sawtooth wave than square.p  pI frankly dont see any way that my app could be pogoing between 200MB and 1GB of memory usage within a second and NOT be spiking the CPU to 100.p  pI have read about some problems that can manifest between garbage collection  event handling, but I have several paths I could go investigate and am trying to narrow down which one to spend time on. Im still pretty slow at .NET and havent developed the intuition I have for embedded devices running C that generally helps me filter what I should investigate first. What if FEELS like is perhaps some event handlers are losing and regaining references to [massive amounts of data] I dont know how this could even happen seeing as memory usage appears to spike back up to 1GB soon after the garbage collector runs and drops memory usage back to 200MB.p  pPrevious versions of this app did not have these problems. Two changes I have made since then includep  ol liutilizing LINQ2SQL instead of our own data manager which had an ADORecordSetHelper object we utilized to execute hardcoded SQL statementsli lichanging the piece of software we use to send the TCP XML messages to a receiver. Due to the simplicity of the what were doing in 2, it COULD be the source of the problem but this memory usage behavior makes me think otherwise.li ol  pI guess my main questions at this point arep  ul liShould I be calling dispose on my LINQ2SQL DataContexts before I return from the method I create them inli liShould I null them out insteadli liif an exception were occuring somewhere in a method after creation of a DataContext, could it cause the DataContext to be kept in memory indefinitelyli liif I store a result from a LINQ query to a valuetype ie int not var, is it lazyloaded then, or lazyd when the variable is usedli lihow possible is it for eventdriven frameworks to hypothetically lose and regain referencesli ul  pedit the events have instancebased subscriptions like discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions298261doeventhandlersstopgarbagecollectionfromoccuringherea and are never unsubscribed for the life of the app.p  pedit2 finally managed to catch it in the profiler, appears to be a 200MB system.string thats being created somehow. Thanks everyone for ruling out GC behavior.p

I cannot use an alternative messaging system here, it must be Ivy. The script currently writes messages to codestdoutcode.p  pstrongProblem 1strong I would like to launch this script as a subprocess or thread, Im open to suggestions from the controller of a Rails app. I would like to be able to receive messages from this script such that they can be displayed on a webpage. There is no need to store these messages persistently in a database, so I was considering using the Rails cache to store and access the messages temporarily and perhaps poll the cache for new messages on an interval using AJAX. Is this possiblep  pstrongProblem 2strong That same Rails app needs to be able to send control messages from a web page e.g., through a user interacting with buttons, drop downs or some other UI elements to the Ivy subprocess such that these control messages can propagate to the hardware.p  pI have looked into potential solutions like a hrefhttpsidekiq.org relnofollowSidekiqa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comcollectiveideadelayedjob relnofollowDelayed Joba, and others, but I cannot find conclusive evidence through browsing docs that these potential solutions can solve both Problem 1 and 2. So, my questions are as followsp  ol liCan a readymade solution like Sidekiq or DelayedJob handle this taskli liIs there some way built into Rails already that I can accomplish thisli liThis question borders on opinion, but Ill ask it anyways. I have other reasons for pursuing Rails, but they may be trumped if this task is going to be extremely difficult. Is doing something like this using Rails such a pain that I should look into alternative solutionsli ol

Negative 995 pIm having a lot of trouble getting MSIX interrupts implemented in a Windows bus driver were writing in WDF  KMDF. Ive read the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff565424vvs.85.aspx relnofollowMSDN documentationa, and theres not really a lot of helpful info there. My understanding is that it should really just work.p  pIve changed our drivers INF file to add the appropriate registry keys and confirmed that they are being set working properly on install. Im properly querying the PCI config space and determining whether MSIX interrupts are supported.p  pThe problem is that once I have this information, I dont know how to change my code to specifically set up the interrupt to be MSIX. I do the standard calls to configure a WDFINTERRUPTCONFIGINIT stuct and call WdfInterruptCreate, but the interrupt that is created is not messagesignaled, and I dont know what needs to be done to actually make this happen.p  pIs there a WDF version of the steps a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff548079vvs.85.aspx relnofollowherea, or should I just be doing the standard WDFINTERRUPT creation steps a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comencalibrarywindowshardwareff547345vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhereap  pDoes anyone have any experience doing this Can anyone provide a source examplep

Negative 995 pIm using codeSpringcode. I have a bunch of services which are being used by a single desktop application. Since this is not a distributed system, all the services are part of the application itself, they are not running remotely I am aware this might not be ideal.p  pInstead of having a different data source for each service, I wanted to use the same data source for all the services in order to reduce the number of db connections. I have achieved this using the codeBeanFactoryPostProcessorcode. I inject the shared data source to all the beans that allow a data source.p  pThe issue Im running into is that although the application seems to load up correctly, all the beans are initialized correctly and data source is injected without a problem, when I try to do anything in the application I get the following exceptionp  precodeorg.springframework.transaction.IllegalTransactionStateException  Prebound JDBC Connection found  HibernateTransactionManager does not support running within DataSourceTransactionManager if told to manage the DataSource itself.  It is recommended to use a single HibernateTransactionManager for all transactions on a single DataSource, no matter whether Hibernate or JDBC access. codepre  pI also have to mention that Im using both codeHibernateTransactionManagerscode and codeDataSourceTransactionManagerscode. codeDataSourceTransactionManagerscode are used when dealing with codeJDBCcode, codeHibernateTransactionManagerscode are used for services using Hibernate.p  pI tried using a codeTransactionAwareDataSourceProxycode to wrap my shared data source for use with the codeDataSourceTransactionManagerscode but this had no effect.  p  pDoes the above exception mean that I might have to use a single transaction manager p

Also, even if its not a perfect csv of all the words, I can always write a quick filter program to properly format it.

Negative 995 pI have a Djangopowered WebApp that occasionally needs to send pretty HTML emails to my users.p  pIm learning how to send HTML emails using Django. Here are the instructions Im following. They are quite simple and good a hrefhttpwww.djangofoo.com250sendinghtmlemail relnofollowhttpwww.djangofoo.com250sendinghtmlemailap  pBy following these instructions Im able to send HTML emails. However, the emails I want to send should share the styles and lookandfeel of my webApp of course. Each Django template on my website includes a bunch of CSS at the top that ensures a consistent look. However, when I simply send that template as and HTML emails, the styles do not kick in in the email. Does CSS not work while sending HTML emails through Django Do I need to manually and explicitly set the fonts, colors, bold, italics, of each element in the HTML template I would like to use for the email How do other people do thisp

Negative 995 pI have an iOS app that processes video frames from captureOutput straight from the camera. As part of the processing Im calling several C functions in another source file. I convert UIImages into raw data and pass these rapidly  all of the processing is done on a queue tied to the video output.p  pThis seems to work fine, up to a point. It seems that Im hitting a limit when the data Im passing becomes too large and I get seemingly random EXCBADACCESS errors popping up during the initialisation phase of the C function. By initialisation I mean, declaring small static arrays and setting them to zero and suchlike.p  pI was wondering if I was hitting some kind of stack limit with passing large amounts of data so tried upping the stack size using Other Linker Flags and the Wl,stacksize,  but this didnt seem to make a difference.p  pIs there anything else I should be aware of calling C functions from a nonUI thread in this wayp  pSorry to be a little general, but Im unable to post specifics of the code and am looking for general advice and tips for this kind of situation.p  pSome further information  we had issues with releasing memory and used autorelease pools in the video processing side in ObjectiveC as recommended as were on a different thread  perhaps were hitting the same difficulty with the C code. Is there a way to increase the frequency that releasesfrees are executed in C or am I just chasing my tailp

Negative 995 pI am using tree panel is ExtJS. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvUJDT.png altenter image description herep  pConsider the above image as the tree panel. If user selects node 1.1.1.2, I should check if all its sibling are also checkedselected, if yes, system should select 1.1.1 node and deselect 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, 1.1.1.3 nodes.p  pSimilarly, At this point I should check the siblings of 1.1.1 node 1.1.2 amp 1.1.3 amp if they previously selectedchecked, then I should deselect 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 and I should select 1.1 node.p  pThis kind of check continues until I reach root node or one the siblings of selected node is not checkedselected.p  pWhat is the best way to achieve this. When I say best way, I am looking for some inbuild property or method which will help me achieve this. p  pThank youp
Negative 995 pIm trying to create an integration app between QuickBooks POS and an online shopping cart in Python.p  pIve found example code for interacting with the QB SDK in Python a hrefhttpblog.bflarsen.comp132 relnofollowhttpblog.bflarsen.comp132a using the win32 library, but it seems that this code is out of date and the string to access the COM has been changed.p  pThe documentation has this to sayp  blockquote   pYou can find examples of QBPOS communication in languages other than Visual Basic in  the QBPOS SDK subdirectory Samplesqbpos. For languages that are not sampled in that directory, refer to the COM interface definitions for the Request Processor API or, optionally, for the qbposFC library. These are in the abposXML and qbposFC type libraries, respectively, and can be viewed with various object browsers, such as the Visual Studio Object Browser.p blockquote  pHowever, it does not provide the string to access the COM.p  pGoogle turns up nothing. Ive searched the registry for RequestProcessor, and the only COM I can find is QBPOSXMLRPC.RequestProcessor, which does  work, but attempts to connect to a server rather than interacting with my QuickBooks, which is what I need.p  pMy question then is, what is the proper COM file to use If there isnt one, is it possible to turn my QuickBooks into an RPC serverp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 995 pI recently broke a solid state drive so I had to reinstall windows etc. After a fresh install, a program I created with pyinstaller wouldnt open or give me an error message. Now that I have installed Visual Studio 2012, it works fine. Im assuming VS comes with a bunch of redistributables, one or more of which is required for pyinstaller. Does anyone know what it is so I can inform my usersp  pEdit I uninstalled every visual c redistributable and .Net framework and it still works.p
Negative 995 pI pull data remotely to create a line chart. The chart spans time. So weekly, monthly, quarter, etc... Series shows digits representing dollar or percentage. Anyhow, problem I have is this. If a user wants to view data for current quarter and the date is the middle of the quarter, the anything after current date drops to zero. Is there a way to have the chart area show the defined time weekly, current quarter, etc... but then cut the series at current date Even if the pulled remote data shows zero rather than null or anything like that I cannot find examples or documentation for this and no luck so far. So am hoping someone here can help.p

Negative 995 pIs it possible to change the context of an Ember view, specifically as regards the valueBinding  I have a matrix of text inputs with rows representing categories and columns representing days of the week. I dont want to save empty values or 0 values, but each input has some other data specific to it that needs to be saved if the user enters hours in that input. So, when generating the form, I create an array of objects, each of which is simply a javascript hash if no existing entry exists for that field or an emberdata record if an entry already exists and use each of these objects as the context for the view. p  pSo, the idea is that if the user enters a zero or an empty string in a field with an existing value, that record is deleted and the context of the view is replaced with a simple hash that still contains the other relevant pieces of info for that field, in case the user comes back and sets that value again. Conversely, adding input to a field that was previously empty would  create a new emberdata record using the values from the attached hash and the value of the input.p  pIve gotten as far as deleting existing records, which works, but the valueBinding for the text input remains bound to the record thats slated for deletion. I would like to change the context of the field to the placeholder hash immediately. If I commit the transaction and come back to that screen, the record has been deleted and the context is now a newly generated placeholder, but I would like to change the context of the TextField view which Ive extended as soon as the value changes to zeronull. Ive attempted using codethis.setcontextcode and codethis.setvalueBindingcode, but neither work.  Heres the code for my view so far.

Negative 995 pI have a game program that is played by a robot.  For simplicitys sake, the game has 2 buttons  win and try again.  To win, the robot must simply push the win button.p  pThe game involves a countdown timer that starts at 10 and runs to 0, ticking once per second.  During each tick of the timer, the robot picks one of the two buttons.  When the timer is at 10, the chance of the robot clicking win is very small.  As the timer gets closer to 0, the chance of the robot clicking the win button increases.  And of course, the robot may never click the win button at all.p  pWhat Im looking for in the end is that the robot click win about 90 of the time with those win clicks being weighted closer to the timer being 0.p  pI did some research on probability absolute novice and my understanding is that the sum of the probabilities at each tick of the time should total up to .90 in order to get my desired result.

Similarly, correct functionality is offered when the dygraph plots curves without any highlightSeries enabled.p  pHowever, I require this type of functionality even when there are multiple curves, highlightSeries is enabled, and the user has not selected one in particular. In this case, it should select the nearest curve based on a fixed xaxis, but whichever is nearest on the yaxis.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhNS1c.png altClosest point selection in dygraphp  pPlease note that the intersection of the crosshair is also where the mouse was located when the screenshot was taken the mouse itself is not displayed. Dygraph has selected the closest point in Euclidean space, which is highlighted on the curve itself. p  pTo reiterate, instead of this behavior, dygraphs should select the point on the curve at the xaxis point where the mouse is located. In this case, it would be where the gray vertical crosshair component cuts the orange timeseries curve.p  pHow should I achieve this type of behavior p  pstrong EDIT strongp  pOne bad workaround I have created is as followp  precodedyGraphs.mousemovefunction e    var parentOffset  this.parent.offset     var relX  e.pageX  parentOffset.left    g.setSelectiong.findClosestRowrelX   codepre  pUnfortunately, due to the nature of mousemove this interferes with the clickanddrag for zooming highlight interaction native to dygraphs, and also requires more logic to stop the circles on the curve from rounding up too soon and jumping to the next datapoint. Surely there has to be a better solutionp  pstrong EDIT 2 strongp  pBelow is a workaround that selects lockson to the nearest curveseries given a fixed row xaxis point, by working out which series is closest to the current Y position minus a 10px offset, unique to my situation. Also, it will not interfere with the clickanddrag for zooming highlight interaction native to dygraphs and it provides basic logic to stop the circles on the curve from rounding up too soon and jumping to the next datapoint n.b. using fixed value or 90px offset unique to my use case.p  precodedyGraphs.mousemovefunction e var parentOffset  this.parent.offset var relX  e.pageX  parentOffset.left var relY  e.pageY  parentOffset.top var relX2  relX   dyGraphs.width  90   g.numRows  2 var yOffsets  [] var closestDistance  999  Arbitrary large number var closestIdx  1  for var i  0 i lt g.numColumns  2 i      yOffsets.push g.toDomYCoordg.getValueg.findClosestRowrelX2, i1    .eachyOffsets, function i,e      var difference  Math.abse  parseFloatrelY10     if difference  lt closestDistance          closestDistance  difference         closestIdx  i        if e.which  1 ampamp closestIdx  1       g.setSelectiong.findClosestRowrelX2, g.getLabels[closestIdx1]  codepre  pIs there a better solutionp

Negative 995 pIve been working on a R project projectA that I want to hand over to a colleague, what would be the best way to handle workspace references in the scripts To illustrate, lets say projectA consists of several R scripts that each read input and write output to certain directories dirs. All dirs are contained within my local dropbox. The IO part of the scripts look as followsp  precode Script 1.   Give input and output names and dirs dat1Dir       lt DDropboxProjectAsource1 dat1In        lt foo1.asc dat2Dir       lt DDropboxProjectAsource2 dat2In        lt foo2.asc outDir        lt DDropboxProjectAoutput1 outName       lt fooOut1.asc  Read data  setwddat1Dir dat1          lt read.tabledat1In setwddat2Dir dat2          lt read.tabledat2In  do stuff with dat1 and dat2 that result in new data foo  Write new data foo to file setwdoutDir write.tablefoo, outName   Script 2.   Give input and output names and dirs dat1Dir       lt DDropboxProjectAoutput1 dat1In        lt fooOut1.asc outDir        lt DDropboxProjectAoutput2 outName       lt fooOut2.asc codepre  pEtc. Each script reads and write data fromto file and subsequent scripts read the output of previous scripts. The question is emhow can I ensure that the directorystrings remain valid after transfer to another userem p  pLets say we copy the ProjectA folder, including subfolders, to another PC, where it is stored at, e.g., CUsersfoomy documents. Ideally, I would have a function codeFindDircode that finds the location of the lowest common folder in the project, here ProjectA, so that I can replace every directory string with p  precodedat1Dir       lt pasteFindDir, ProjectAsource1, sep  codepre  pSo that p  precode At my own PC dat1Dir       lt pasteFindDir, ProjectAsource1, sep  gt DDropboxProjectAsource1   At my colleagues PC dat1Dir       lt pasteFindDir, ProjectAsource1, sep  gt CUsersfoomy documentsProjectAsource1 codepre  pOr perhaps there is a different way Our work IT infrastructure currently does not allow using a shared disc. Ill put helperfunctions in an official R project ie, hosted on a hrefhttpsrforge.rproject.org relnofollowR forgea, but Id like to use scripts when many IO parameters are required and because the code can easily be viewed and commented. p  pMany thanks in advancep
Negative 995 pIm making a 2 player game using a JApplet. I draw the first players screen on the left side, and the second players screen on the right side, then draw the minimap of the entire map in the bottom center.  I draw everything to a buffered Image called bimg then use bimg.getSubimage to get both sides for each player based on their locations. I use the standard drawImage method with extra parameters to draw a scaled version of the entire image of the map. The problem Im having is that the minimap I draw flickers every few frames, it appears that sometimes it draws the left side first, and other times draws the right side first, instead of drawing both sides and then the map ontop of them. Im wondering if theres a method anyone can suggest that would possibly help fix this problem. I hope the context Ive provided is clear enough, here is some code to reference. Thanksp  precodedrawP1Side  bimg.getSubimagep1.viewX, p1.viewY, 400, 700 drawP2Side  bimg.getSubimagep2.viewX, p2.viewY, 400, 700 g.drawImagedrawP1Side, 0, 0, null g.drawImagedrawP2Side, 410, 0, null g.drawImagebimg, 320, 500, 200, 200, null codepre

Negative 995 pOften when I get an error in Angular it causes an infinite loop in the browser and can lock down everything until I can kill the process. This tends to happen mostly when calling a function from a template with something like an ngshow.p  precodeltdiv ngshowifCanTakeActiongt     ltbutton ngclicktakeActiongtltbuttongt ltdivgt codepre  pIf the function emifCanTakeActionem gets an exception then it might become an infinite loop.p  pObviously it is fairly easy to just fix the error in emifCanTakeActionem but it is highly irritating that my computer goes for a short siesta every time it happens.p  pI am guessing the loop appears due to dirtychecking. Something in the crash of emifCanTakeActionem causes another round of checks, which crashes it again, ad infinitum. Or it just dirtychecks that fires continuously. But how do you avoid this error Is it simply illadvised to run the function from the template like that Often I would assign a model in the controller instead and look at that, but sometimes you have a case where the result might change as the user interacts with the page, which is why I base it on a function instead. p  pSo, is this correct Is it the dirtychecking that causes this issue Would a watch do better I assume that would get the same basic problem Is there a good way to catch and prevent infinite loops in generalp
Negative 995 pI am writing an app that uses 3 fonts for 2 language UIs. For hebrew UI with hebrew font all is good, but for the english UI all the labels are getting clipped at the bottom with the english font on iOS6 on 7 its good.p  pI started investigating, and realised that also the line spacing in more than 1 line texts is way too small, and codesizeToFitcode, codesizeThatFitscode and codeconstrainToSizecode all gives height that is way too small for that font to fit in the frame.p  pFirst I tried to set codeclipsToBoundsNOcode which did nothing, the I thought about hardcode enlarging the frame by code1.15code when using the eng font, but than 1 I still have the line spacing problem, and 2 I couldnt get it to work with the codeUITextFieldcodes For some reason the placeholder and the caret both getting clipped but typed text works fine...  I tried overriding codetextRectForBoundscode and codeeditingRectForBoundscode and return the given bounds with code0,10,0,10code for codeUIEdgeInsetscode but no luck...p  pI thought about editing the font info itself, but A I have no idea how to do it And couldnt find any info on Google and B couldnt find any mac app that will do it Only Windows stuff.... Also  It seems weird that I need to do it because on iOS7 it works perfectly without any need to adjust any frame...

The migration was completed without problems but now users are getting a write conflict anytime they try to change something, even text in a description field.  SSMA inserted a timestamp field in each table, which I thought would prevent the write conflicts.  Is there something I need to do to Access to force it to use the timestamp fieldp  pThe error isp  pThis record has been changed by another user since you started editing it.  If you save the record, you will overwrite the changes the other user made.p  pWhile researching this Ive tried other approaches such as setting BIT or REAL fields to NOT NULL and inserting default values.  This made no change to the issue.  The write conflict even happens when updating an NvarcharMAX field.

Negative 995 pI hope someone has already faced and solved this issue, and can point me to the correct direction.p  pSo I have rest of my unit tests working Core.Tests has tests for ViewModels to see they are working properly. Now I would like to set up a test project for Phone.Tests that would only test out the binding. So suppose on the login page, something gets entered into the username text box, and that value should be updated in ViewModel and viceversa.p  pAs a testing framework, I am using WP Toolkit Test framework, and not MS one WP Toolkit framework runs on the phone itself, meaning it has access to the UI thread.p  pIn theory a test is supposed to look like followingp  precode    [TestMethod]     [Asynchronous]     public void UsernameUpdateViewShouldUpdateModel              const string testUsername  Testing          var usernameTextBox  GetUiElementltPhoneTextBoxgtUsernamePhoneTextBox           initial value         Assert.AreEqualnull, viewModel.Authorization.Username, Default value should be blank                   usernameTextBox.Text  testUsername                   Assert.AreEqualtestUsername, viewModel.Authorization.Username, Binding not set for 0, Username           private T GetUiElementltTgtstring name where T  UIElement              return Tview.FindNamename      codepre  pNow, I need to somehow create the view in [TestInitialize] method, and this is what I think I have setup wrong.p  pI have tried creating the ViewModel manually then I created the View manually, and binded both DataContext and ViewModel just to be on safe side to created viewModel.p  pAt this point, I am expecting changing one property on any one should update the other.p  pOfcourse the error is my test fails. I cant figure out if I should be looking at a custom presenter all the examples seem to be for ios, droid. I also tried the followingp  precode    public class TestAppStart  MvxNavigatingObject, IMvxAppStart              public void Startobject hint  null                      ShowViewModelltUserLoginViewModelgt               codepre  pand then on my testInitialize I thought I could start it, but I guess I need to find RegisterAppStart and once thats done, try to get the view back from RootFrame.p  pThere must be an easier way... anyonep  pThanks in advance.p  pEdited I have got this following as Base Testp  precode    public abstract class BaseTest      private IMvxIoCProvider ioc      protected IMvxIoCProvider Ioc              get                      return ioc                    public void Setup              ClearAll           protected virtual void ClearAll              MvxSingleton.ClearAllSingletons         ioc  MvxSimpleIoCContainer.Initialize         ioc.RegisterSingletonioc         ioc.RegisterSingletonIMvxTracenew DebugTrace         InitialiseSingletonCache         InitialiseMvxSettings         MvxTrace.Initialize         AdditionalSetup           private static void InitialiseSingletonCache              MvxSingletonCache.Initialize           protected virtual void InitialiseMvxSettings              ioc.RegisterSingletonIMvxSettingsnew MvxSettings           protected virtual void AdditionalSetup              ioc.RegisterSingletonMock.OfltISettingsgt         ioc.RegisterSingletonltIApplicationDatagt gt new ApplicationData         ioc.RegisterSingletonltIPlatformSpecificgt gt new PlatformSpecific         ioc.RegisterSingletonltIValidatorFactorygt gt new ValidatorFactory                   ioc.RegisterTypeltIMvxMessenger, MvxMessengerHubgt       codepre  pOn my TestClass initialize, I call base.Setup, which does setup except the ViewDispatcher.

Where am I leaking memory Thanks in advance for your helpp  pP.S., Ive already researched smart pointers further a hrefhttpwww.informit.comarticlesarticle.aspxp25264 relnofollowherea, and I would just use the standard librarys smart pointers if this implementation were not a requirement of the assignment. Also, I know I have my call to stdsortbegin, end commented out, but I didnt want to start sorting until I got the smart pointers going in the right place.p

Negative 995 pFor testing purposes, I need to make sure that my app handles trying to access the users photos correctly for all scenarios. p  pOnce the user is presented with the dialog asking for access to the photos, the user wont ever be presented with it again for that appat least I cant figure out how they could be.p  pObviously if the user selects YES then access is granted and will continue as such unless the settings are changed in the users Settings app. Alternatively, if NO is chosen, you wont have access until those same settings are changed.p  pBut for testing, I want to make sure that my app handles either scenario correctly when the user is first presented with the dialog. I seem to only be able to test this once though. After that, there doesnt seem to be any way to show this dialog again. Somehow, even if the app is deleted and reinstalled, the option chosen when first presented is remembered and the dialog is never shown. p  pThe only way I can test it over again is to change the bundle identifier, clean and run the app again. This essentially installs another or new app on the device and the dialog is shown. This is kind of a long work around for testing purposes. Is there anything else I can dop

Negative 995 pI am using the Android AudioTrack object to stream a 16bit mono PCM file. My code reads a double from a DataInputStream, converts it to 8 bytes, and then saves that 8 bytes to a buffer to be written to the AudioTrack. This works fine.

I have tried using floats instead of doubles, and I get the same result.

Is this the right approach i am following  Let me tell you that my functionality is working fine in dev environment but i am worried with the approach before it goes live. p  p another approach2 which i thought of was that i could bring all the data first into the browser and than with jquery i could manipulate the DOM data and hence no need to call the Java servlet again and again. BUt my data is very complex , updating that in dom  client side would be very complex and even if i update that than i need to send the complete updated data of DOM to servlet which would be complex p  pthats why i decided to go with the first approach, which will update my object directly in servlet and i can get the latest object from session to submit to the server. p

Negative 995 pThis sounds to me like a generic problem so Im wondering if there is a general recommended way to deal with these situations regardless of the build  dependency management tools used Gradle in my case. I can imagine this issue arising regardless of the build tool, even in a small project where the few dependencies are handled manually and which is simply built with Java using the codejarcode command.p  pMy Java project uses Velocity 1.7 so it has the Velocity 1.strongem7emstrong JARs in its classpath.p  pHowever this project also uses ReportNG, which depends on Velocity 1.strongem4emstrong it even has the entry codeClassPath velocitydep1.4.jarcode in its manifest, plus its downloaded zip contains codevelocitydep1.4.jarcode and its a hrefhttpreportng.uncommons.org relnofollowhome pagea explicitly mentions that codevelocitydep1.4.jarcode must be in the classpath.p  pIm wondering how to avoid having on my classpath the JARs for both Velocity versions, which is the likely cause of strange behavior Im seeing and which in any case doesnt sound at all like a good idea.p  pIm going to try to make ReportNG use Velocity 1.7 instead of 1.4 but it wont necessarily work and Id like to avoid doing that if there is a clean way of dealing with these situations.p

Negative 995 pI am creating a database for a web application and am looking for some suggestions to model a single entity that might have multiple types, with each type having differing attributes.p  pAs an example assume that I want to create a relational model for a Data Source object.  There will be some shared attributes of all data sources, such as a numerical identifier, a name, and a type.  Each type will then have differing attributes based on the type.  For the sake of argument lets say we have two types, SFTP and S3.  p  pFor the S3 type we might have to store the bucket, AWSAccessKeyId, YourSecretAccessKeyID, etc.  For SFTP we would have to store the address, username, password, potentially a key of some sort.  p  pMy first inclination would be to break out each type into their own table with any noncommon fields being represented in that new table with a foreign key in the main Data Source table.  What I dont like about that is that I would then have to know which table is associated with each type that is stored in the main table and rewrite the queries coming from the web app dynamically based on that type.p  pIs there a simple solution or best practices Im missing herep

Negative 995 pMy Android application has a native C layer and a Java layer. The Java layer accesses the native layer via JNI calls.p  pCan the C layer safely create C objects for its own internal use, and store them in C member variables Im talking about C objects that dont need to be accessed by Java code in any way, i.e. they are managed and deleted completely in the C layer. In other words, the same object via a member variable is accessed throughout multiple JNI calls, but only the C layer needs to access it.p  pI need confirmation in this matter, because I know that there are special JNI methods for handling objects relevant terms local reference, global reference, etc.. If Im correct, these apply only for objects that are emvisible by or created for Java codeem as well.p  pTherefore, I suppose that nativeonly C objects can be created and deleted in the usual ways such as codenewcode and codedeletecode, and Java doesnt need to know anything about them. No special interoperability considerations are necessary, as long as the objects and any references to them reside exclusively in the C layer. Is this correct Can I define C classes and methods in this layer in the same way as if it was a usual C application without any JNIJava interoperability To be general, is it allowed to instantiate and emstoreem plain C objects, i.e. objects that are out of the authority of DalvikJVMp

Negative 995 pI want to be clear I am asking about the case where I am not using any concurrency in my own implementation. I just want to know if the framework within which my backend will be invoked ie google app engine itself imposes threadsafety requirements on the code running on it.p  pThank youp  hr  pP.S. as a related but separate question, is there any guidance on how to do multithreading in our own backend code which then obviously needs to be appropriately threadsafe. Specifically, can we use javas standard executor services  thread pools, or there is some googleapproved API Thanks.p

Negative 995 pI am beginner for WPF and MVVM. While coding it, I came across an issue with ListItems variable in VehicleAddViewModel class, which is of type ObservableCollection List. Binding from View to ViewModel is proper, ListItems is getting updated, Even OnPropertyChanged method is also working but when I add new List to ListItems, it is not reflecting to UI. p  pAt the other end, If I make ListItems object static, it starts working. I dont know why is it happening.p  pI am anxious to know why is it happening like this.p  pI have bunch of files, so putting just relevant ones for my working and nonworking versions, please let me

Negative 995 pI have a C program that tracks a players position in a game. In this program I have a class called Waypoint X, Y, Z, which represents a location on the game map. In one of the threads I spawn, I keep checking the players distance from a certain target Waypoint, quite rapidly after each other in whiletrue loops. In the Waypoint class have a method called public double DistanceWaypoint wp, that calculates the distance from the current waypoint, to the waypoint passed as a parameter.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is it okay to create a new Waypoint for the players position, every time I want to check the distance from player to the target waypoint The program would then potentially, in a whiletrue loop, create this player Waypoint over and over again, just for the purpose of calculating the distance.p  pPS My program probably needs to smartly use resources, as it is running multiple threads with continuous while loops doing various work such as posting the players X,Y,Z location to the UI.p  pThanks a lotp

For examplep  ul liI have provided the Eclipse 1,25GB Heap, anyway my eclipse eats up the heap over the day.li liOn content assist it happens sometimes, that eclipse is freezing for 510 secondsli liOn typing I assume also the content assist is sometime also freezing and waiting for multiple secondsli lisometime eclipse is freezing at all, so nothing happens with the IDE.li ul  pI am working under Ubuntu 14.04, but colleagues on Windows have the same issue. So, probably it is not dependent on OS, but I am not fully sure.p  pThe question to me is nowp  ul liis there a way to trace plugins regarding the performance impacting the developerli liis there a way to trace the performance of specific plugins jvisualvm seems not to be sufficientli liis there a way to trace all plugins and execution of plugins involved on content assistli liis there a way to temporarily disable plugins on runtime of eclipse to dig down to the responsible pluginli ul  pHopefully someone can help me out of the darkp

Negative 995 pIm developing a game with THREE.js that will run inside UIWebView inside an app on iOS8.p  pIve profiled this application in Chromes developer tools and ensured that there are no memory leaks  that is  memory use gets up to a certain value and remains constant throughout.p  pRunning this application in UIWebView, however, reveals that the memory use grows over time, as if no garbage collection takes place at all.p  pIve searched online, but can not determine conclusively whether iOS8 UIWebView has garbage collection or not. Some articles seem to suggest it does, and some that it does not. If it does  how can I trigger thisp  pThe only solution I can imagine at this time, if there is no garbage collection is periodically killing  deallocating UIWebView, and recreatingrestarting the app a game at the menu screen .p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter spending a few more days looking for leaks heres what I foundp  pDeallocating UIWebView doesnt work  system never deallocates everything even with all the suggested hacks and memory problems get compounded.p  pI still dont know if UIWebView has marksweep garbage collection  the ProfileInstruments panel seems to suggest it does, but the memory use rarely ever goes down. Common sense tells me that some garbage collection must take place, because all the temporary objects in code, and things going out of scope do get cleaned up.p  pMy THREE.js objects do not seem to ever be collected  but this may be related to THREE.js own issues of having to manually dispose of resources in order to free any GLrelated handles etc.p  pThere are mysterious leaks related to .bindthis  example setTimeoutobject.func.bindobject,100  will apparently never clean up the function after timeout dispatches  so I end up prebinding and storing it as a var instead. Same goes for any even handlers passed to jQuery.p  pMy 2 scene game menu scene and game scene, I ended up rewriting in such a way that both scenes remain in memory never get removed. Any objects and models I create in the game, instead of relying on GC to get collected, get recycled instead. When objects are removed from the scene, they are put in a pool of objects of the same type to be reinitialized and readded when such object is required in the scene again. It seemed like an overkill at first, but the benefit is  no memory leaks objects remain allocated, and faster creationadding to scene.p

Negative 995 pI havent been able to figure this problem out in a long time. Lets say that we have a 2D plane with a predefined root which is always at the origin of 0,0. This 2D plane will not have a restriction on how large it can be.p  pLets also say that a user can input however many finite number of points on this graph and each point can lie ANYWHERE on this plane. These points are defined as S0, S1,... Sn and the user also gives the respective X,Y coordinate location of these points.p  pI want to find the shortest path length from the root point to every point on the graph.p  pWhat do I mean by this Well, lets say that the shortest path has been determined to be 6. What this means is that the path length from the root point to a point S0 is 6, the path length from root to S1 is 6, the path length from root to Sn is 6. p  pWHAT I HAVE DONE TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMp  pSee my diagram strongDISCLAIMER The purpose of my diagram is to show you my thought process. It is NOT representative of how I want to approach this problem.strong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comasRJb.png altenter image description herep  pIn this example that I have created, assume that all points are evenly spaced apart. What I tried to do was keep finding the midpoints between points. For example, midpoint between S0 and S1 is A. Midpoint between S2 and S3 is B. And midpoint between A and B is C. Root heads on over to C, and can travel an equal distance to any point on the graph. strongThe shortest path length from root to ANY point on the graph is 4, in this example. In other words, I want the shortest way to get from root to S0 that is equivalent to the shortest way to get from root to S1 that is equivalent to the shortest way to get from root to S2 that is equivalent to the shortest way to get from root to S3strongp  pThe problem is that this method will not work ALL the time, especially when you have odd number of nonroot points that are randomly scattered across the plane. I am not able to find an algorithm. Does anyone have any pointerstips for mep

Negative 995 pI created a script which takes an xml input and creates html based reports for ease of viewing. All of the reports are based off of the same html template. Some reports are small 50KB, some are larger 7MB. I have a problem with the larger page not rendering images and links pointing to the wrong places. What is odd is that if I remove the large data blocks just a series of divs, things render fine. Also, things are fine if the reports are smaller to begin with. p  pFor example, with a small report, the following code renders the img correctlyp  precodelta hrefhttpwww.company.comgtltimg idlogo src..imageslogo.png altlogo gtltagt codepre  pThe emexactem same code gives me a missing image icon in a larger report. When inspecting the element in Firefox, I get Could not load the image message. Again, all reports are based off the same html template, and the code for the logo and nav never change, neither does the directory structure.p  pAdditionally, the following code is a simple link to return to the main pagep  precodeltnav idnavgt     lta href..index.htmlgtDashboardltagt ltnavgt codepre  pThe link works properly in a smaller page, but in a larger one it tries to redirect to fileuserindex.html wrong.p  pI have tried moving the large file into a different directory, tried moving it to the parent directory and redoing the links, but nothing helps. While first loading the page, it displays the alt text, then the broken image icon. p  pThis happens in Chrome, Firefox, and IE11. The image displays properly in Safari. The only thing that seems to have an impact is the size of the file.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated as all my Googlefu has been spent.p

How would I do thatp  pSo far I have taken a look at emIjzerenHeinfamousmapem but it doesnt provide emOpenlayersem support which I need because of the rotation functionality. With emFamo.usem, rotation probably could be programmed, but is a big effort I suppose until you have a smooth two finger zoompanrotate interaction with the map thats already integrated into emOpenlayers 3em and emGoogle Mapsem but only the native emAndroidiOSem version, not in emJSem.p  pIve tried it with emgaddicohens famousviewsem package, but no map is showing up.p  pAny suggestionsideasp  pAnother thing is What is the problem at all Why isnt the map showing up, I mean emOpenlayersem is a emJSemlibrary and I thought everything that can be displayed in a div can also be shown in a emFamo.us Surfaceemp  pUnfortunately I am missing some insights about how emFamo.usem etc. are built up.p  pRegardsp

Negative 995 pFor our senior project, four of my classmates and I have teamed up to build an Android app that uses Google Maps. p  pSo far everything is going fine, but we have hit one issue that we are not sure how to work around. p  pWhen using the Maps API, you sign up for an API key that is assigned to the program we are creating. In order to authenticate the API key on the Google Developer console, it must be associated with an SHA1 certification, which appears to be generated by our JDK. It would seem that, even though all five of us are working on the same project, we all have different SHA1 certifications. p  ol lipIs it possible for all of us to use a single SHA1 certification for our project, even though we are on different computers and phones, so that we dont need to go through the process of discovering each of our individual certifications and registering them  pli lipHow do we get around this certification issue once we are prepared to publish the app or at least share it with our other classmates for testing Clearly I can not take the time register each of my 40 classmates certifications individually, and once we release this to the public there will be no way to do so. How does one get around this pli ol  pIve searched on the Google API documentation pages about this, and there is plenty of information about the API key, but surprisingly little about the SHA1 certification, which is an equally important aspect of authentication. p  pIve also searched on this site and found similar questions, but most of them seem to involve user credentials IE login and password. At this time, the only credentials we are using is a Facebook login via the FB API so I dont think that is relevant though I may be wrong. p  pThank you so much for your time and wisdom. p

Negative 995 pSo Im consuming a RESTFul API to get the data I need. This API returns json and i converted this to C models. The API returns some general info about a vendor and an array with products. The array of products also consists out of arrays for pricing information and product availability etc... p  pThe problem im facing is that when a product is selected by a user to buy i have to gather specific information out of the different arrays. Currently Ive made a ViewModel for the data that needs to be send to process the order. This is done by binding the actual data using hidden fields and use a HttpPost from the view, resulting in  30 hidden fields to set the proper data values.p  pIm kinda new to MVC and this seems dirty. I thought i would be able to pass the modelsfor example the VendorModel,ProductModel,PricingModel,AvailabilityModel from the viewwith a POST to the controller and create the ViewModelbased on the models send so that i can send that to the API.p  pIs this actually how it should be done or is my design faulty and should i approach this differentlyp  pA side note One of the things i found is that most people suggest to use an identifier to get the data you need but the problem is that the API doesnt have the right calls to get Product, Pricing, Availability data based on Id, its just one big object with arrays based on the search query.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pSo after some information i decided to try out nested models and created a viewmodel like thisp  precodepublic class TestViewModel      public TestViewModel              productInfo  new ProductInfo           public ProductInfo productInfo  get set      codepre  pMy view is like thissuper simpelp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormCreateOrder,Products      Vender info etc...

Lets say it looks like the following p  precode[    NameJohn Smith    Id23  ,      NameJane Doe    Id298  ,   ] codepre  pI do autocomplete on the name field and send back to the server the name and id of the selection or entered text when the input field loses focus or when user uses the submit buttonp  pSo here is my scenario. I have 3 cases for autocomplete  p  ol lipUser selects a name from suggestions and then sends the name and id for that selection back to serverpli lipUser types in input field and no option is available from autocomplete so user types a new name that is not in the options that autocomplete knows about. In this case, when input field loses focus, it sends to the back end the new name and an id of 1 and makes autocompletetypeahead pull the new data from the backend bc it needs to know what the id of the newly created name is so that future autocomplete requests can be done on itpli lipUser types in a name that appears in suggestions from autocomplete, but the user doesnt select the name from the options instead it keeps typing the name out. This is equivalent to selecting the name except that it doesnt trigger the selected event so I dont know the id for that name unless I go through all the names and check if they match but dont know how to get the array of options that twitters typeahead is using for autocomplete so I need to make another request to the server so this wont work.pli ol  pstrongQuestionstrongbr Ive been able to do case 1 and 2 with twitters typeahead and no knockout. How would I implement case 3 I used to check on the backend that the name sent from front end is not in the database, so this was a name comparison  thing is Id need to index the names column. Id prefer to do a check by id, but Im open to suggestions. Im also open to changing the design from autocompletetypeahead to something else that deals with my 3 cases.p

Negative 995 pIm working on a ecommerce project. I would like the customers of the ecommerce site to be able to add items to the shopping cart and checkout without having to login.p  pTo do this, I have decided to store the items that the customers would like to add to the shopping cart inside a Collection. e.g.p  precodeCartItems  new Mongo.Collectioncartitems codepre  pIn order to differentiate this customers shopping cart items from other customers, I have decided to add a extra fieldp  precode var sessid  Meteor.defaultconnection.lastSessionId codepre  pe.g.p  precode     id  HCo7JYsaruYBNQuC9,     qty  1,     productid  hAajzGxpLK4zJ3pXW,     session  uqTiaeqiawsxLMu7A  codepre  pto the document added to the CartItems collection.p  pThe problem with this solution is that whenever the page is REFRESHED, the last session Id changes and therefore the cart becomes empty again even though the same user is still using the page.p  pAlso, the documents added to the Collection does not get cleaned up deleted as I have no way of detecting if the session is going to be ended by the browseruser.p  p1. Whats the ideal solution to this problemp  p2. How do I implement the shopping cart for it to know that even though the page has been refreshed the user using the site is most likely the same person and therefore it should still keep the same items in the shopping cart  With my current solution of using session ids to differentiate one cart item from another seems to be not the suitable solution for this...p  p3.  With my current solution of using last session ids, the Collection will eventually be full of cart items with session ids from the past and I would like to provide a automatic cleanup functionality within the app for this.  Whats the best way to do this cleanup Is there a way to detect an end of sessionp  pThank you very much.p

Converting 11 AM UTC to EST gives 7 AM EST which is correctp  pI always maintained that servers should be configured to the correct time zone. I guess I was wrong.

Negative 995 pI have a custom codeListViewcode where I show elementss from a codejsonArraycode that I download from server. Now I want the user be able to like entries. So when he clicks on an codeListItemcode, the database of the server is updated so ne number of Likes increases. To avoid that users can like infinte times I store a row in the SQLite Database with the position of the codeListItemcode. This works fine until there are new entries in the server database, and the positions change. How can I solve this problem Is there a possibility to get an id from a codeListItemcode instead of the positon or something Here is my codep  precodegetALlEntrysListView.setOnItemClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener           Override         public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position, long id                  Cursor cursor  getLikesdbh                 cursor.moveToFirst                 if cursor.moveToFirst                      do                    check if Item is liked 1 or not 0                         if Integer.parseIntcursor.getString2  1                              dbh.updateLikedbh, position, Integer.parseIntcursor.getString2, 0                             dislikeposition                             cursor.close                          else if Integer.parseIntcursor.getString2  0                              dbh.updateLikedbh, position, Integer.parseIntcursor.getString2, 1                             likeUploadposition                             cursor.close                          else                              dbh.addLikedbh, position, 1                             likeUploadposition                             cursor.close                                               while cursor.moveToNext                   increase numer of likes on the Server Database the dislike method works the same way public void likeUpload int position     try           JSONObject entryClicked  jsonArray.getJSONObjectposition         entryID  entryClicked.getStringid          final ListltNameValuePairgt params  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt         params.addnew BasicNameValuePairid, entryID          new AsyncTaskltApiConnector, Long, Booleangt              Override             protected Boolean doInBackgroundApiConnector... apiConnectors                  return apiConnectors[0].likeparams                       .executenew ApiConnector          finish         startActivitygetIntent codepre

However, what still bugs me is the followingp  ol liThe difference for T2 between java 7 and 8. I guess one explanation  would be that the worker executing the parallel loop does not go idle in java 8, but instead finds other work to perform.li liThe superlinear speedup 3x with 2 workers. Also, note that T2 seems to increase with every iteration see below, note that this is also the case, although to a smaller extent with P4,8. The times in the first iterations of the warmup are similar to those mentioned above. Maybe the warmup period should be longer, but still, isnt it strange that execution time increases, i.e. Id rather expect it to decreaseli liFinally, I still find the observation that there are a lot more started amp not completed dummy tasks than worker threads curious.li ol  pp  precodeRun progress 0,00 complete, ETA 000040 Fork 1 of 1 Warmup Iteration   1 2,365 sop Warmup Iteration   2 2,341 sop Warmup Iteration   3 2,393 sop Warmup Iteration   4 2,323 sop Warmup Iteration   5 2,925 sop Warmup Iteration   6 3,040 sop Warmup Iteration   7 2,304 sop Warmup Iteration   8 2,347 sop Warmup Iteration   9 2,939 sop Warmup Iteration  10 3,083 sop Warmup Iteration  11 3,004 sop Warmup Iteration  12 2,327 sop Warmup Iteration  13 3,083 sop Warmup Iteration  14 3,229 sop Warmup Iteration  15 3,076 sop Warmup Iteration  16 2,325 sop Warmup Iteration  17 2,993 sop Warmup Iteration  18 3,112 sop Warmup Iteration  19 3,074 sop Warmup Iteration  20 2,354 sop Iteration   1 3,045 sop Iteration   2 3,094 sop Iteration   3 3,113 sop Iteration   4 3,057 sop Iteration   5 3,050 sop Iteration   6 3,106 sop Iteration   7 3,080 sop Iteration   8 3,370 sop Iteration   9 4,482 sop Iteration  10 4,325 sop Iteration  11 5,002 sop Iteration  12 4,980 sop Iteration  13 5,121 sop Iteration  14 4,310 sop Iteration  15 5,146 sop Iteration  16 5,376 sop Iteration  17 4,810 sop Iteration  18 4,320 sop Iteration  19 5,249 sop Iteration  20 4,654 sop codepre

For example, when I run codefilter values can be clearedcode, the code.filteridcode input has the same code.filteridcode value from codeonly saved filter can be editedcode. If I change the value in codeonly saved filters can be editedcodeback to codecode, the codefilter values can be clearedcode test passes. p  pBasically, the component sets the codeinitialValuescode property when it first inserts the element. Its set to a copy of the codefilterValuescode property, so it should be set to the controllers codefilterValuescode property, and shouldnt change. However, it seems that the modified codefilterValuescode property is carried over to the next test, which means that codeinitialValuescode is set to that modified property when it rerenders. So, the test rerenders the templates, but retains the modified values in the controller and component. p  pI can make the tests pass by creating an codeinitialValuescode property in the controller and passing that into the component, but thatd mean having duplicate properties in the controller since codefilterValuescode and codeinitialValuescode would have the same values. p  pI could modify the user record in the component, but I thought were supposed to only modify records in the controller or router. Besides, isnt the codeafterEachcode hook supposed to reset the app p

Negative 995 pI am controlling my session time in my ASP.NET Application by the following setting in web.config.p  precode ltconfigurationgt   ltsystem.webgt     ltsessionState timeout20 gt   ltsystem.webgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pI am displaying an alert box before 2 mins of users Session end time using JQuery and JQueryUI on client side Since, ASP.NET shares session in multiple tabs, if the user opens multiple copies of the same page in different tabs, they will count as same session but displays session timeout alert at different times as it is more of client side leaving false info with User.p  pfor example, if user opens first tab then session starts, he opens second tab  10 mins and another at 18 mins. By the time he is in third tab first tab displays alert of session timeout. But second and third tabs will not as its time is still counting for 20 mins.  Since user will be on most recent tab, he thinks session is still on while it expired on first open tab.p  pI dont wanna make a separate session for each tab.p  pNot sure on how to deal with this but sure some one might have an answer.

And its working very well.p  pNow were moving some stuff to azure. And I dont want to put my publish profile in the project because if I do so any one can publish from his visual studio instance.p  pI thought about this  create publish profiles from the azure account, upload them to the CI server and passe an absolute path to the publishprofile msbuild parameter.p  pDo you think there is a cleaner way to do this  Id prefer to do the profile uploading directly in teamcity.p

Negative 995 pI want to do a query for the score of a logged in user and the 9 users behind him. I would like to do it as efficiently as possible best solution would be of course to query the parse DB only once and I am searching for the right approach.p  pThe algorithm should go from querying all the scores ordered from the highest to the lowest and somewhere between I need to get the position of the logged in user and fetch his and the next 9 scores after him.p  pI know that I need to use querys codeskipcode, but I cant figure out how to fetch the score efficiently. I know I can fetch the whole table and then get the position of the user by email or sth similar, but that would require a lot of time of the table was big and, the data can change in between querying again.p  pdid anyone of you have some similar issue and figured out a way how to do itp  pThanksp

Negative 995 pSo I have a big response from an API in a multidimensional array, and I need to find all the instances of a certain keyvalue pair, specifically code[type] gt PhotoFieldcode My task would be easy if they were all the same depth, but they vary, so I am using a recursive function to get all the key value pairs of a specific value. I have morphed a standard recursive array searching algorithm for my purposes. But I still have the problem that when it pushes the path of each instance to the codepathcode array, it just merges to the path of the previous instance. p  pWhat I really need is for each instances path to be a subarray within codepathcode.p  pHere is my functionp  precodefunction arraysearchRecursiveneedle, haystack, strictfalse, patharray                       ifarraykeyexistselements, haystack                  return false                          foreach haystack[elements] as key gt val                   if isarrayval ampamp subPath  arraysearchRecursiveneedle, val, strict, path                       path  arraymergepath, arraykey, subPath                     return path                  elseif strict ampamp val[type]  needle  strict ampamp val[type]  needle                       path[]  val[key]                                           if emptypath                 return path                          return false          codepre  pI call it withp  precode arraysearchRecursiveresp[form] codepre  pAnd here is some sample datap  precoderesp      Array      [form] gt Array                      [name] gt Site Inspection                         [elements] gt Array                                      [0] gt Array                                                      [type] gt Section                             [key] gt 86d2                             [elements] gt Array                                                                      [0] gt Array                                                                                      [type] gt ChoiceField                                             [key] gt 450c                                                                                                                        [1] gt Array                                                      [type] gt Section                             [key] gt 6021                              [elements] gt Array                                                                          [0] gt Array                                                                                      [type] gt TextField                                             [key] gt c8e5                                                                               [1] gt Array                                                                                      [type] gt PhotoField                                             [key] gt 01dd                                             [label] gt Photos of Protective Structure                                                                                  [2] gt Array                                                                                      [type] gt PhotoField                                             [key] gt 8e1c                                             [label] gt Photos of Degradation to Protective Structures                                                                                                                                                                [2] gt Array                                                      [type] gt Section                             [key] gt 9335                             [elements] gt Array                                                                      [0] gt Array                                                                                      [type] gt TextField                                             [key] gt b614                                                                              [1] gt Array                                                                                      [type] gt Repeatable                                             [key] gt 6b00                                                                                                       [0] gt Array                                                                                                                      [type] gt TextField                                                             [key] gt b646                                                                                                                                                                          [1] gt Array                                                                                                                      [type] gt PhotoField                                                             [key] gt 9747                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                codepre  pSincere thanks for any help.

Negative 995 pI have a few test classes that test for access to a specific API endpoint depending on the user signed in. brbr I would like to use these classes to test multiple API endpoints. The logic for the tests would basically stay the same, the only thing changing in each test file is a factory class for generating data and the API endpoint url. brbrMy initial solution was to abstract the logic into its own class, and have each subclass set the url endpoint and the factory class. Something like thisp  precode basetests.py class BaseAPITest     url  None     factoryclass  None      ...logic...   testsubclass.py class SubclassAPITestBaseAPITest     url  myAPIurl     factoryclass  MyFactoryClass codepre  pThis works great, but I want to abstract it one more step. The base tests have about 10 different test classes, and in order to use them I have to subclass each of them in my subclass test file. Is it possible to put these 10 base tests into one class, set the variables on that container class, and then have each individual test use the variables from that container class Then, all I would have to do is subclass that one class in order to test all 10. Something like thisp  precode basetests.py class ContainerForBaseAPITests     url  None     factoryclass  None      class BaseAPITestOne         def geturl             return ContainerForBaseAPITests.url          def getfactoryclass             return ContainerForBaseAPITests.factoryclass          ...logic...      class BaseAPITestTwo         def geturl             return ContainerForBaseAPITests.url          def getfactoryclass             return ContainerForBaseAPITests.factoryclass          ...logic...   testsubclass.py class SubclassAPITestContainerForBaseAPITests     url  myurl     factoryclass  MyFactoryClass       With just this one class, all of the BaseAPITests will run using the above variables codepre

The codeIsEmptycode function call allows values to be deleted without throwing errors.p  pIn the codeValueColumnscode range, again I can only enter values and these are formatted correctly. If I delete the value in a single cell, the codeIsEmptycode function behaves normally, and the value is cleared. However, if I select a range of cells e.g. codeI5I10code and press delete, the following error message is thrownp  blockquote   pEntry must be a numberp blockquote  pThis is in contrast to columns C, D and H, where deleting a range of cell contents throws no error message.p  pI cant see any reason why this behaviour appears to be inconsistent.

Negative 995 pI am new to web programming. I am using flask and angularjs and I am trying to send json data in response to an angularjs http.get request. The angularjs code is from this tutorial a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTRrL5j3MIvo relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTRrL5j3MIvoa.  My folder structure is thisp  precoderoutes.py countries.json templates    index.html codepre  pThe error that I am getting is that within my ngrepeat in index.html, country is not defined. This shows me that countries is not getting the json data. However, the route countries.json works. If you type in a hrefhttplocalhost5000countries.json relnofollowhttplocalhost5000countries.jsona into the browser after running the server with python3 routes.py in the terminal, it will display the json, so that is good, but http.get from angularjs is not reading it. When running a hrefhttplocalhost5000 relnofollowhttplocalhost5000a it wont even print out a print statement when I put one in the app.routecountries.json, which tells me I am misunderstanding http.get and that maybe it isnt even reaching the countries.json route. Could someone please tell me what I am missing here Thanks Im sure my problem is that the data needs to be sent from flask in some way other than returning the json file itself.

Negative 995 pI made a dumb mistake telling GWT to use my User Data Path as the place or my web archive, so GWT went ahead and cleared it. I restored most of the data and downloaded Eclipse again.

Negative 995 pIm making an app that uses the YouTube API to play YouTube videos.  When I go into full screen mode, I switch the player style to CHROMELESS because I want to create my own set of media controls.p  pI have developed a set of gestures that map to changing volume, brightness, and seeking.  When these changes occur, a progress bar pops up over the video showing the user their changes in real time.  I have placed all my Views in a single FrameLayout in order to get the progress bars to show up on screen when the player is fullscreen.p  pThe problem is that before I added volume control functionality the video would automatically pause as soon as I entered fullscreen mode. I am handling orientation and screenSize changes myself. I noticed that it would pause roughly 2 seconds after my personally made seekbar would pop up.p  pSo for testing, I altered my code by NOT changing the player style to CHROMELESS, that is, I left it as DEFAULT.  I removed my seekbar as well and now the video worked fine I could change brightness and play the video with no problem.  During another test, I removed all instances of youtubePlayer.pause from my code, left the seekbar in, and changed back to CHROMELESS. But the problem returnedso it must be something to do with the seekbar.p  pNow, however, I have added volume control functionality and when I run it even when Im not fullscreen the player pauses almost immediately after I press play and it doesnt work at all afterwards.p  pCan anyone help me out  Ill add some of my code when I get back to my computer.

Negative 995 pBased on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma166094112925659this answera, I conclude that Esqueleto does not allow to compose two queries with a codeleft outer joincode. However, I hope there still is a solution to my problem, somewhere.p  pI want to do a left outer join with a table that is additionally restricted. Consider my first approachp  precodefetchFarmsByCity1 city  runDb . select . from    farm LeftOuterJoin pig gt do     on  pig . PigFkFarm . just farm . FarmId     where            pig .

FarmCity . val city     return farm, pig codepre  ul liI get all the farms and their 4legged pigs.li liI get farms even if they dont have any pigs at all thanks to the left outer join.li liHowever, I dont get the farm that has pigs with 2, 3, or 5 legs, but this is what I need if the pigs have 3 legs, I want the farm without any pigs.li ul  pMy second approach is an sqlmotivated subquery that fails already during type checking, probably because of the restriction linked on the top of this postp  precodepigsQuery  from  pig gt do   where  pig . PigNumberOfLegs . val 4   return pig  fetchFarmsByCity2 city  runDb . select . from    farm LeftOuterJoin pig gt do     pigs lt pigsQuery     on  pig . PigFkFarm . just farm . FarmId     where            farm . FarmCity . val city codepre  pIs there another way to solve this Can I somehow move the numberoflegsrestriction in front of the outer join in the first approach Splitting it up into two queries would be my measure of last resort.p  pI feel that this is standard enough to have alternative solutions.p

Negative 995 pI have seen solutions for getting the MAC address of a successfully connected hotspot client, from an app running on an Android device with hotspot turned on.  However, I have not seen one that gives the MAC address of a hotspot client that fails to connect that is, attempts to connect to the hotspot, but fails to obtain an IP address because of authentication failure.p  pThe reason I am looking for the MAC address of such a failed hotspot client is because I would like to take note of the Wifi devices nearby.  Then I can sort of identify people nearby, similar to advertising systems.  Just that I do it with a normal Android phone, while they rely on specialized hardware.p  pI cannot expect a successful hotspot connection, because the Android hotspot device crashes and reboots if I attempt to turn hotspot on with an authentication configuration that is different from what the user has already set.  Android detects it as some system violation and reboots.  Neither is this a desired approach, because I would prefer to leave the hotspot configuration untouched.  This is another reason I would like to get failed clients.p  pHas anyone got an idea how this can be done  Thanks.p
