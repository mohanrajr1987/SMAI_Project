Positive 53249 pWe have this problem where our application has stopped working on Android 5.0 devices since the Google released the latest version of Android System WebView 45.0.2454.95.  If we disable this version of the WebView by going to the device settings, apps, Android System WebView and clicking Disable the application works again.  However this is not satisfactory for some of our customers and we really need to find a fix where it works with the latest version of Android System WebView.p  pOur application makes heavy use of jQuery and jQuery Mobile.  We currently use jQuery 1.7.1 and jQuery Mobile 1.1.0.  We cant easily upgrade to a newer version.p  pWhen a page loads up in the application any method called inside a jQuery selector doesnt run, e.g.p  pcodefunction      Your code here codep  pThis code successfully executes when the old version of the WebView is used but not when the latest version is used.  Attempting to call the code outside the selector has resulted in other problems.p  pDuring my investigations so far, I have discovered the problem seems to come from something in jQuery Mobile as when I remove the reference to jquery.mobile.js, the code then executes again.  However as you might expect the problems then occur due to jQuery Mobile being an integral part of our application.p  pDoes anyone know of any issues with jQuery Mobile on the latest version of Android System WebView that could be causing thisp

Positive 53249 pI needed to pass a WebView to another Activity, and I couldnt create a new WebView in the new Activity because the html content can not be loaded twice. So I managed to solve the problem using a static blackboard and the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentMutableContextWrapper.html relnofollowMutableContextWrappera.p  pThe approach was i The original Activity instantiates the WebView with a a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentMutableContextWrapper.html relnofollowMutableContextWrappera, and before to start the second Activity, ii I detach the WebView from the original Activity, iii store it in a static blackboard, and when the second Activity is started, iv it gets the instance of WebView on the blackboard, v updates its Context using the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentMutableContextWrapper.html relnofollowMutableContextWrappera, vi and attach it to the new Activity. When the second Activity is closed, the reverse way is followed to put back the WebView in the original Activity.p  pThis approach works very well in the most Android versions, but since the Lollipop version, the WebView does not refresh its content while it is attached to the second Activity. However when the second Activity is closed and the WebView goes back to the original Activity, it works fine.p  pIn my researches, I discovered about the new behavior of the WebViews from the Android L that reduces memory footprint and increases performance by intelligently choosing the portion of the HTML document that needs to be drawn. p  pSo I suspected that this feature could interfere in the WebViews refreshing, but even calling the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebView.htmlenableSlowWholeDocumentDraw relnofollowenableSlowWholeDocumentDrawa method, the WebView continues not working properly.p  pSomeone would know explain the cause for this behavior p

Negative 53249 pAs far as I know, only the convenience methods return created objects with an autorelease, so that the receiver is not responsible for the memory of that object. But because Apple says that when you use a method that has a name consisting of new, alloc, create or copy, youre responsible for releasing the object that method returns, I think that these methods should not autorelease these objects. Otherwise they would be convenient and the receiver would not be responsible at all as long as he does not retain the received object. Did I get that rightp

Negative 53249 pIn my company, weve been converting .net Web Sites to Web Applications.  I have become the goto person for this task.p  pIn order to accomplish this, I create a new project, copy all the files from the Web Site and include them in the project, and run the Convert To Web Application tool to create the design files.  This is totally awesome, however, I still need to manually add library and service references to my new project to match the references in the Web Site.p  pCan I automate this process as wellp  pCLARIFICATION I think that this question could be generalized as Can I copy references from one VS project to anotherp  pCORRECTION to the above Actually, it does not generalize this way because Web Site references are kept in the web.config file while Web Application references are kept in the project file.p

Negative 53249 pSystem.Reflection does not AFAIK support reflecting on global methods in an assembly. At the assembly level, I must start with the root types.p  pMy compiler can produce assemblies with global methods, and my standard bootstrap lib is a dll that includes some global methods. My compiler uses System.Reflection to import assembly metadata at compile time. It seems if I depend on System.Reflection, global methods are not a possibility. The cleanest solution is to convert all of my standard methods to class static methods, but the point is, my language allows global methods, and the CLR supports it, but System.Reflection leaves a gap.p  pildasm shows the global methods just fine, but I assume it does not use System.Reflection itself and goes right to the metadata and bytecode.p  pBesides System.Reflection, is anyone aware of any other 3rd party reflection or disassembly libs that I could make use of assuming I will eventually release my compiler as free, BSD licensed open source.p  pSOLVED There is no gap, except in my knowledge.

Negative 53249 pIm working on a new website, written in VB.Net using ASP.NET MVC2, there is a need to call legacy VB6 code for various complex bits of business logic.  The VB6 is a framework consisting of many dlls and is very stateful, we are pretty much emulating how the framework is used in our client application, ie the application runs lots of state setup, a user logs on even more state and then loads a file even more state.  p  pIve been provided with a web service interface framework to get this up and running for use in the web app, this web framework hides the legacy code behind a thin layer running under IIS.  The idea being that thread pooling provided by IIS will reduce memory use etc etc.  I cant help but believe that the guy who provided this has missed the point, since each instance is so stateful there is no way that a thread pool can work, since once a user logs on using one particular object from the pool, no other object will be capable of servicing that client since it wont have the state   Also, adding a web service interface and associated SOAP marshalling is a huge overhead compared to calling the objects directly.p  pThe only way I can think of doing this is either a single legacy interface instance which is used by all clients and blocked by each call until it completes, or a thread per client with each legacy interface object being created in a new thread and living for the life of the client.  p  pNone of these is ideal but with the amount of code in question and the prolonged migration programme to .net 2 years and still stateful I cant think of an alternative.  We run the original client app in a citrix environment for some customers so I expect that it could also run ok with thread per client given a beefy enough server and that the overheads of the framework itself should be lower than when the client app is involved.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 53249 pI have a classifieds website, and when posting a new classified users fill out a form offcourse.

However, here they have the option of clicking back to change something, which is where my problem comes in.p  pNow, at the bottom of the mainform, I have  fileupload tool, which refreshes the page for each upload. This is what is causing the problem. However, it is too late for me to change it to a nonrefreshing fileupload now ajax for instance.p  pAnyways, the problem is that IF the user have uploaded a file and submits the page, the verify page opens. So from here the back button only displays a Warning page has expired instead of showing the form with the images uploaded.p  pHowever, users are able to press F5 refresh to refresh the browser and the form will appear once again as it was, but this is no good solution.p  pHow can I fix thisp  pAnd how come other browsers dont have this problem, they actually go back and display the full form with the imagesp  pAlso, offcourse, if no images are uploaded, the back button works fine in IE.p  pIf you need more input let me know...p  pBTW NOT TESTED IN IE8 YET.p

Negative 53249 pIm already tossing around a solution but as I havent done something like this before I wanted to check what SO thought before implementation. p  pBasically I need to modify an existing web based application that has approximately 20 users to add push notifications. It is important that the users get the notifications at the same time PCA shouldnt get an alert 20 seconds before PCB. Currently the system works off of AJAX requests, sending to the server every 20 seconds and requesting any updates and completely rebuilding the table of data each time even if data hasnt changed. This seems really sloppy so theres two methods Ive come up with.p  ol lipstrongDont break the connection from serverclient.strong This idea Im tossing around involves keeping the connection between server and client active the entire time. Bandwidth isnt really an issue with any solution as this is in an internal network for only approximately 20 people. With this solution the server could push Javascript to the client whenever theres an update and modify the table of data accordingly. Again, strongits very important that every connected PC receives the updates as close to the same time as possible.strong The main drawback to this is my experience, Ive never done it before so Im not sure how well itd work or if its just generally a bad idea. pli lipstrongContinue with the AJAX request, but only respond in intervals.strong A second solution Ive thought of would be to allow the clients to make AJAX requests as per usual currently every 20 seconds but have the server only respond in 30 second intervals eg 20000 and 20030 regardless of how many AJAX requests it recieves in that span of time. This would require adjusting the timeout for the AJAX request to prevent the request timing out, but it sounds okay in theory, at least to me. pli ol  pThis is for an internal network only, so bandwidth isnt the primary concern, more so that the notification is received as close to each other as possible. Im open to other ideas, those are just the two that I have thought of so far.p  h2Edith2  pPrimarily looking for pros and cons of each approach. DashK has another interesting approach but Im wondering if anyone has experience with any of these methods and can attest to the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, or possibly another method.p

Negative 53249 pIm implementing a Python ontology class that uses a database backend to store and query the ontology. The database schema is fixed specified in advance, but I dont know what type of database engine is being used. However, I can rely on the fact that the Python interface of the database engine uses the Python DBAPI 2.0 a hrefhttpwww.python.orgdevpepspep0249PEP 249a. A straightforward idea is to let the user pass a PEP 249compliant codeConnectioncode object to the constructor of my ontology, which will then use various hardcoded SQL queries to query the databasep  precodeclass Ontologyobject     def initself, connection         self.connection  connection      def gettermself, termid         cursor  self.connection.cursor         query  SELECT  FROM term WHERE id  s         cursor.executequery, termid,          [...] codepre  pMy problem is that different database backends are allowed to support different parameter markers in the queries, defined by the codeparamstylecode attribute of the backend module. For instance, if codeparamstyle  qmarkcode, the interface supports the question mark style codeSELECT  FROM term WHERE id  code codeparamstyle  numericcode means the numeric, positional style codeSELECT  FROM term WHERE id  1code codeparamstyle  formatcode means the ANSI C format string style codeSELECT  FROM term WHERE id  scode. If I want to make my class be able to handle different database backends, it seems that I have to prepare for all the parameter marker styles. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of a common DB API for me as I cant use the same parameterised query with different database backends.p  pIs there a way around it, and if so, what is the best approach The DB API does not specify the existence of a generic escaping function with which I can sanitize my values in the query, so doing the escaping manually is not an option. I dont want to add an extra dependency to the project either by using an even higher level of abstraction SQLAlchemy, for instance.p

Negative 53249 pWhat are the advantagesdisadvantages to each methodp  pI know Ive read somewhere in either a book or on this site why using table inheritance is crappy for Entity Framework 4.p  pFor instance, why not make one table which has an entityId, datecreated, datemodified and then have every other class inherit that in entity framework Then my tables for all other entities dont need to have those columns. Then I can have a person class inherit that base class, and then a specific person inherit person.p  pI am not sure of the advantages of this though other than writing a smaller SQL script to generate the database...p  pDisadvantages I see are that it makes querying viewing the data directly in SQL a big pain in the ass all relevant information is broken across so many tables, and I also asked my friend who saidp  pBlockquote The biggest thing that sticks out for me is the fact that i wouldnt want my database to rely on the current inheritance structure of my application. if, for whatever reason, i wanted to change the design of my application in terms of inheritance, it wouldnt matter because my data wouldnt be reliant on my current system design. i think of data storage as just thatstorage. the database is normalized according to proper database design, but inheritance is a programatic choice of application development, not data storage. that alone would prevent me from using it. inheritance is a very difficult thing to do properly when it comes to designing an application. its much easier to change application code than it is to change and migrate database data when most lessseasoned devs approach a problem they approach it with inheritance. i did too when i first started developing. it logically makes sense. however once developing for a long time you learn that delegation is really the best way to go services calling services in the case of soa and that singlepurpose services provide a lot more reuse than inheritance.

Negative 53249 pBasically, I have a URL that streams xml updates from a chat room when new messages are posted.  Id like to turn that URL into an InputStream and continue reading from it as long as the connection is maintained and as long as I havent sent a Thread.interrupt.

Negative 53249 pIm in the process of porting an app originally developed on iOS to Android.  Im trying to accomplish the followingp  ul lievery time the app is started, call the start method on a Manager classli lievery time the user leaves the app, call the stop method on the same Manager classli lievery time the user comes back to the app resuming from idle, call the start method on the Manager classli ul  pThe socalled Manager class handshakes with a server on the Internet and needs to do a variety of bookkeeping activities every time the user the user enters and leaves the app.p  pWhereas iOS enables you to subclass the UIAppDelegate class and have code that runs when the app starts, ends, or resumes from idle, it seems Android doesnt have an equivalent approach.  Instead, these are the options with Androidp  p1 Activity class methods for every time an Activity view is created, stopped, or resumedbr 2 Application class onStart and onDestroy for every time the app is started or killedbr 3 Service mechanism to create a background task that can be used to perform longliving operations in the background while the app is active or even while its not activep  pNone of the above align real well with what Im used to in iOS.  Option 1 would require every Activity in the apps view hierarchy to have code that runs when the app startsstopsresumes.  Of the 3, I sense option 3 is more relevant.  Im just not entirely clear how I could startstop a service in Android as the user startsstopsresumes an app without regard to the specific activity theyre on at the time.p  pI would appreciate input from Android developers or developers that work on both iOS and Android.p

Negative 53249 pIm trying to figure out why our software runs so much slower when run under virtualization.

As far as I know, the code as weve written in uses only a single thread. Also, for what its worth this is a console only application written in pure C with no UI at all.p  pCan anybody shed any light on any of this for me Even just information on what some of these codentdllcode and codekernel32code calls are doing Im also unsure how much of the differences are 6432bit related and how many are virtualnotvirtual related.

Negative 53249 pId like to have mp4s playing on a webpage inside an old TV, and I am wondering if there is a script, or a combination of scripts that would give me this effect.  The ability to have buttons on the TV that actually start the moviecontrol the volume etc. would be a bonus, as would the odd oldtime visual effect poor signal, lines in image, etc., but without having to alter the actual MP4, as well as the ability to warp the video image so that it fits the curved screen.  Id also like the option to go fullscreen, as with flowplayer.p  pI think I saw a method of doing something like this a while back, but from googling about today, I havent turned up much.p  pSo far I just have flowplayer installed on the webpage, and an image of an old TV with a cut out where the movie would show.  But I cant work out how to get the image showing above the flowplayer block.

Negative 53249 pCurrently Im experimenting with a little Haskell webserver written in Snap that loads and makes available to the client a lot of data. And I have a very, very hard time gaining control over the server process. At random moments the process uses a lot of CPU for seconds to minutes and becomes irresponsive to client requests. Sometimes memory usage spikes and sometimes drops hundreds of megabytes within seconds.p  pHopefully someone has more experience with long running Haskell processes that use lots of memory and can give me some pointers to make the thing more stable. Ive been debugging the thing for days now and Im starting to get a bit desperate here.p  pA little overview of my setupp  ul lipOn server startup I read about 5 gigabytes of data into a big nested Data.Mapalike structure in memory. The nested map is value strict and all values inside the map are of datatypes with all their field made strict as well. Ive put a lot of time in ensuring no unevaluated thunks are left. The import depending on my system load takes around 530 minutes. The strange thing is the fluctuation in consecutive runs is way bigger than I would expect, but thats a different problem.pli lipThe big data structure lives inside a TVar that is shared by all client threads spawned by the Snap server. Clients can request arbitrary parts of the data using a small query language. The amount of data request usually is small upto 300kb or so and only touches a small part of the data structure. All readonly request are done using a readTVarIO, so they dont require any STM transactions.pli lipThe server is started with the following flags RTS N I0 qg qb. This starts the server in multithreaded mode, disable idletime and parallel GC. This seems to speed up the process a lot.pli ul  pThe server mostly runs without any problem. However, every now and then a client request times out and the CPU spikes to 100 or even over 100 and keeps doing this for a long while. Meanwhile the server does not respond to request anymore.p  pThere are few reasons I can think of that might cause the CPU usagep  ul lipThe request just takes a lot of time because there is a lot of work to be done. This is somewhat unlikely because sometimes it happens for requests that have proven to be very fast in previous runs with fast I mean 2080ms or so.pli lipThere are still some unevaluated thunks that need to be computed before the data can be processed and sent to the client. This is also unlikely, with the same reason as the previous point.pli lipSomehow garbage collection kicks in and start scanning my entire 5GB heap. I can imagine this can take up a lot of time.pli ul  pThe problem is that I have no clue how to figure out what is going on exactly and what to do about this. Because the import process takes such a long time profiling results dont show me anything useful. There seems to be no way to conditionally turn on and off the profiler from within code.p  pI personally suspect the GC is the problem here. Im using GHC7 which seems to have a lot of options to tweak how GC works. p  pWhat GC settings do you recommend when using large heaps with generally very stable datap

Negative 53249 pI do not work with C directly much and a basic language nuance just set me back and I would like to understand it better so I can avoid it in the future.p  pI am using the Queue implementation found at the following link.p  pa hrefhttpwww.planetsourcecode.comvbscriptsShowCode.asptxtCodeId9202amplngWId3 relnofollowhttpwww.planetsourcecode.comvbscriptsShowCode.asptxtCodeId9202amplngWId3ap  pIts a pretty common queue where values are pushed and popped. FIFO But for some reason the last value that I push onto the queue sets all values in the queue with the same value.p  pI started with the following code.p  precodeQueue q queueinitampq for int i0ilt10i      MyData inmd     inmdgtmNumber  i     queuepushampq, inmd      MyData h  MyData q.headgtdata     MyData t  MyData q.tailgtdata      NSLoginmd i, inmdgtmNumber     NSLoghgtmNumber i, hgtmNumber     NSLogtgtmNumber i, tgtmNumber     if q.headgtlink          MyData l  MyData q.headgtlinkgtdata         NSLoglgtmNumber i, lgtmNumber       codepre  pBut I found that when I popped the values off the number value was 9 for each instance. I thought I had some pointer bug and tried to fix it for a while. I thought that since I declared inmd inside of the block of the for loop it would be a unique instance with a unique memory address. Eventually updated the code to the following...p  precodeQueue q queueinitampq for int i0ilt10i      void data  mallocsizeofMyData  key change     MyData inmd  MyData data     inmdgtmNumber  i     queuepushampq, data      MyData h  MyData q.headgtdata     MyData t  MyData q.tailgtdata      NSLoginmd i, inmdgtmNumber     NSLoghgtmNumber i, hgtmNumber     NSLogtgtmNumber i, tgtmNumber     if q.headgtlink          MyData l  MyData q.headgtlinkgtdata         NSLoglgtmNumber i, lgtmNumber       codepre  pNow the ensures that a new instance is created because malloc is used and I cast it to a variable I can set the int value. This creates the output appears as I expect.p  pI assume this is how C is supposed to work but I did not expect it. Normally in other languages like Java, C and even JavaScript declaring a variable within a block would create a new instance of the variable which is what I expected here. But that is not the case.p  pWhat is happening in this casep
Negative 53249 pIm looking for general advice.  I created a Visual Studio 2010 project that outputs an ocx file that is used on XP and Vista machines.  The DLL on which it depends has been updated on our Win7 machines.  I simply needed to rebuild for Win7 using the exact same code with an updated .lib file.  I created a second project configuration ReleaseW7 and it only differs from the original project config Release in that it points to the new .lib.p  pSo now I have 2 files both named xx.ocx.  Besides looking at the name of the folder each file resides in or looking at the creation time of each there is no way to determine which is which.  I thought of using different file version numbers but as far as I can tell and Im relatively new to this so I could certainly be wrong that would require two separate projects each with a slightly modified resource .rc file, instead of simply having two configurations within the same project.  If nothing more, that seems like a waste of hard drive space.  It also feels like the wrong way of using file version numbersp  pIs there a cleaner or more standard way of handling this  All I really want is a way for the folks who install the ocx and support the end user to know for certain that they are working with the correct file.p

Negative 53249 pconfiginitializersdevise.rbp  precode Use this hook to configure devise mailer, warden hooks and so forth. The first  four configuration values can also be set straight in your models. Devise.setup do config    gt Mailer Configuration    Configure the email address which will be shown in DeviseMailer,    note that it will be overwritten if you use your own mailer class with default from parameter.   config.mailersender  abcgmail.com     Configure the class responsible to send emails.    config.mailer  DeviseMailer     gt ORM configuration    Load and configure the ORM. Supports activerecord default and    mongoid bsonext recommended by default. Other ORMs may be    available as additional gems.   require deviseormactiverecord     gt Configuration for any authentication mechanism    Configure which keys are used when authenticating a user. The default is    just email. You can configure it to use [username, subdomain], so for    authenticating a user, both parameters are required. Remember that those    parameters are used only when authenticating and not when retrieving from    session. If you need permissions, you should implement that in a before filter.    You can also supply a hash where the value is a boolean determining whether    or not authentication should be aborted when the value is not present.    config.authenticationkeys  [ email ]     Configure parameters from the request object used for authentication. Each entry    given should be a request method and it will automatically be passed to the    findforauthentication method and considered in your model lookup. For instance,    if you set requestkeys to [subdomain], subdomain will be used on authentication.    The same considerations mentioned for authenticationkeys also apply to requestkeys.    config.requestkeys  []     Configure which authentication keys should be caseinsensitive.    These keys will be downcased upon creating or modifying a user and when used    to authenticate or find a user. Default is email.   config.caseinsensitivekeys  [ email ]     Configure which authentication keys should have whitespace stripped.    These keys will have whitespace before and after removed upon creating or    modifying a user and when used to authenticate or find a user. Default is email.   config.stripwhitespacekeys  [ email ]     Tell if authentication through request.params is enabled. True by default.    config.paramsauthenticatable  true     Tell if authentication through HTTP Basic Auth is enabled. False by default.    config.httpauthenticatable  false     If http headers should be returned for AJAX requests. True by default.    config.httpauthenticatableonxhr  true     The realm used in Http Basic Authentication.

If    using other encryptors, it sets how many times you want the password reencrypted.       Limiting the stretches to just one in testing will increase the performance of    your test suite dramatically. However, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not use    a value less than 10 in other environments.   config.stretches  Rails.env.test  1  10     Setup a pepper to generate the encrypted password.    config.pepper  b1179d3eccc2985aa7e9e438d8866464943f84449e53014c19852e795fdc4c17ca0b779e843ea8826589c213aff8c91c16c4a937685a183b622899e0dbf120a6     gt Configuration for confirmable    A period that the user is allowed to access the website even without    confirming his account. For instance, if set to 2.days, the user will be    able to access the website for two days without confirming his account,    access will be blocked just in the third day. Default is 0.days, meaning    the user cannot access the website without confirming his account.    config.confirmwithin  2.days     Defines which key will be used when confirming an account    config.confirmationkeys  [ email ]     gt Configuration for rememberable    The time the user will be remembered without asking for credentials again.    config.rememberfor  2.weeks     If true, a valid remember token can be reused between multiple browsers.    config.rememberacrossbrowsers  true     If true, extends the users remember period when remembered via cookie.    config.extendrememberperiod  false     If true, uses the password salt as remember token.

For instance, you can set    secure gt true in order to force SSL only cookies.    config.cookieoptions       gt Configuration for validatable    Range for password length. Default is 6..128.    config.passwordlength  6..128     Email regex used to validate email formats. It simply asserts that    an one and only one  exists in the given string. This is mainly    to give user feedback and not to assert the email validity.    config.emailregexp  A[][]z     gt Configuration for timeoutable    The time you want to timeout the user session without activity. After this    time the user will be asked for credentials again.

Dont put a too small interval or your users wont have the time to    change their passwords.   config.resetpasswordwithin  2.hours     gt Configuration for encryptable    Allow you to use another encryption algorithm besides bcrypt default. You can use    sha1, sha512 or encryptors from others authentication tools as clearancesha1,    authlogicsha512 then you should set stretches above to 20 for default behavior    and restfulauthenticationsha1 then you should set stretches to 10, and copy    RESTAUTHSITEKEY to pepper    config.encryptor  sha512     gt Configuration for tokenauthenticatable    Defines name of the authentication token params key    config.tokenauthenticationkey  authtoken     If true, authentication through token does not store user in session and needs    to be supplied on each request.

Formats like    html, should redirect to the sign in page when the user does not have    access, but formats like xml or json, should return 401.

Negative 53249 pIm working on the finishing touches of a custom patch for Quartz Composer. As of right now, I have almost everything stripped out of the patch, and its crashing telling me BAD ACCESS when I try to NSLog a NSDictionary value that is an ivar, and that worked perfectly in the last execution when I assigned it.p  pMy code looks like thisp  precode BOOL startExecutionidltQCPlugInContextgtcontext     lastBoutData  [[NSDictionary alloc] init ]     return YES    BOOL executeidltQCPlugInContextgtcontext atTimeNSTimeIntervaltime withArgumentsNSDictionaryarguments       NSLogself.inputBoutData , self.inputBoutData     NSLoglastBoutData , lastBoutData        have new data, put it on the output     self.lastBoutData  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithDictionaryself.inputBoutData]     NSLogassigned , lastBoutData      return YES  codepre  pI can see the log shows that all three NSLog lines work perfectly until self.inputBoutData has input.  Then, I see that self.inputBoutData is successfully copied to lastBoutData in the last NSLog line of the loop.p  pIn the very next run of executeatTimewithArguments, self.inputBoutData is still full, but lastBoutData is blank again  Im cant see how that can happen.  Then, it runs one more loop, just like the last, and successfully copies the self.inputBoutData to lastBoutData, and its logged again.  The next time through, I get BAD ACCESS just before the second NSLog statement.  p  pI was getting some error messages that told me that lastBoutData wasnt an NSDictionary, so out of desperation, I added a [lastBoutData retain], and it doesnt crash.  Im not releasing this ivar, so Im not sure why I have to retain it.  I do very similar things with other ivars in many other patches with no issues.  What could I be missing  Why is this thing releasing on me, or is that even what is happeningp

Negative 53249 pIm writing a JFace standalone application using eclipsewindowbuilder pro.  Windowbuilder is a nice tool to work with, but Im having trouble finding information on the organizational structure of such an application.  p  pCurrently Im extending the standard ApplicationWindow class as is standard in windowbuilder examples for the main window of my application and subclassing SWT composites for my sub windows in the application.  The problem Im having is that I lose the ability to use JFace actions  databindings when Im graphically building SWT Composite subclasses in windowbuilder.  The palette for adding JFace actions is inaccessible when using SWT designer while subclassing standard SWT components.  Ive searched at length for how to add this palette to no avail the standard a hrefhttpcode.google.comjavadevtoolswbprouserinterfacepalettemanager.html relnofollowmethoda fails since this isnt a normal palette that appears in the palette manager.  Ive also tried adding the JFace action component to my existing palette, but cant find documentation on how to add an abstract class Action to the palette. I know that I can write all the code I want by hand, but it defeats the purpose of using windowbuilder.p  pId really like to stick to the standard JFace vieweraction model, but I cant figure out which components I should be subclassing for my sub windows in my app.  Ive tried subclassing the Window class directly but this doesnt yield access to windowbuilders JFace Actions palette.  Im not sure under what conditions that palette is accessible  Ive been iteratively removing and adding components to ApplicationWindow, Im getting desperate.  I have a few custom widgets that Id gladly write JFace Viewers for if I could figure this out.   p  pAny windowbuilder fans out there  Is subclassing SWT Composite a reasonablestandard way to go about making components of this application  What is the standard for writing apps that are more complicated than a single ApplicationWindow Ive searched high and low, but can only seem to find tutorials and examples that are a single application window  nothing composite.  I feel like Im missing some key pieces of information with regard to the structure of more complicated JFace applications.  I suppose my holy grail would be the JFace version of SWT Composite that would allow me access to JFace actions code generation through windowbuilder.  p  pAny tips andor reading material explaining standard JFace design for larger applications would be appreciated  p

Negative 53249 pIve spent hours trying to figure out the answer to this and just continue to come up empty handed. Ive setup a XMPP server through OpenFire that is fully functional. My goal with creating the server was placing an alert system for when an event is completed on my server. For example when one of my renders is finished rendering takes hours, sometimes days, it has the option of running a command when its finished. This command would then run a .bat file telling a theoretical program to send a message via the broadcast plugin in OpenFire to all parties involved in the render. So it needs to be able to receive parameters such as N for name of the render and L for the label of it.p  pIve located two programs that do exactly what Im looking to do but one does not work and from the sounds of the comments may have never worked and the second one is seemingly LINUX only. The render server is Windows as is the OpenFire server so naturally it would not work. Here are the links though so you can get an idea.p  pa hrefhttpthwack.solarwinds.commedia40orionnpmcontentgeneral136769xmppcommandlineclient relnofollowhttpthwack.solarwinds.commedia40orionnpmcontentgeneral136769xmppcommandlineclientap  pa hrefhttpmanpages.ubuntu.commanpagesjauntyman1sendxmpp.1.html relnofollowhttpmanpages.ubuntu.commanpagesjauntyman1sendxmpp.1.htmlap  pBasically the command I want to push is identical to that of the first link.p  pstrongxmppalert.exe m N is complete.

Negative 53249 pIve written a Java program that accesses an SQL database.  In JGrasp the program works perfectly.  No bugs at all.  But when I create the jar file of the program and start it up outside of JGrasp it wont access the database for some reason.  I specified the driver in the CLASSPATH, otherwise it wouldntve worked in JGrasp, right  Does anyone know what would make it not connect to the database  The only difference is running the program in JGrasp or doubleclicking the jar file nothing else is changing.p

Obviously, in this case, I have to give a threshold a priori to set some very tiny variance values to 0 in the covariance matrix, otherwise, the covariance matrix will not be sparse and its size would be 120,000 by 120,000, which is impossible to handle with one single machine. Also, the loadings eigenvectors will be extremely large, and should be stored in sparse format. p  pThanks very much for any help p  pNote I am using a machine with 24GB RAM and 8 cpu cores. p

Negative 53249 pFor the Xperia Play prior to ICS, the only way to get input from the touchpad is through a NativeActivity not a plain old Activity.  Unfortunately, all drawing in a NativeActivity, as the name suggests, is done on the nativeside, not Javaside.  In order to get input on the nativeside with graphics on the Javaside, the following must be added to the NativeActivitys onCreate methodp  precode    getWindow.takeSurface null      getWindow.setContentView R.layout.main  codepre  pAnd set up a couple methods through JNI for receiving the touchpad and touchscreen input from the nativeside.  You can then happily draw through Androids Java API, while still getting the touchpad input.  This works quite well for Xperia Plays running preICS.  Even adding menus via onCreateOptionsMenu doesnt cause any problem.p  pThe problem comes when the Xperia Play is running ICS.  The menu has moved to the Action Bar.  Unfortunately, it isnt possible to interact with the action bar pressing the 3 dots is ignored, and it acts like Im pressing the surface behind the action bar.p  pIn case it makes any difference, I am creating the action bar menu options through onCreateOptionsMenu.  I am using Window.FEATUREACTIONBAROVERLAY, and making the actionbar visible like so when the user presses the back button mSingleton is the NativeActivity instancep  precodemSingleton.runOnUiThread     new Runnable              public void run                      if mSingleton.getActionBar.isShowing                  mSingleton.getActionBar.hide             else                 mSingleton.getActionBar.show                codepre  pThis makes the action bar visible, but as I mentioned, I cant interact with it.  Is there a way to force the action bar to have focus or something  The fact that normal menus work fine on preICS versions makes me think it should be possible to interact with the action bar too, since it is just a menu of a different type.p

Negative 53249 pHere is my scenario.....i have a windows service running.p  pIt does a 3 step process, 1st step is it takes a date range from a hosted application and does a couple of insertion,updation and table creations,in 2nd step it fetches a number of records based on the date range from a tablesome lacs of records and processes these each entry and modifies some and writes them into a file,in 3rd step it loads the written files from step 2 into the mysql database using Load Data Local.p  pThe issue im facing is in the hosted application that i mentioned in step 1.The application shows a GUI in which the processing date range is shown and since its a time consuming process, i need to show a remaining time during which the windows service will finish the processingall the 3 steps that i mentioned.p  pAnd one more thing the client network speed may vary. Any ideas about how to tackle this scenario. Im writing this application using C asp.net.p

When set to 100, the div does not take into consideration the width of the sidebar and expands to the full width of the page, thus overlapping the sidebar. Normally I would just set the div to have a marginright of the width of the sidebar. However, for my purposes, this isnt going to feasible because on different screen resolutions, the div might be lower on the page below the sidebar and thus there will be a blank gap to the right of the div plus it would just be easier for coding purposes to figure this problem out so the pages divs know how wide they should be themselves. For example, in my text picture above, if the page were skinnier because its on a lower screen resolution, the first box would probably be underneath the sidebar. With a marginright of the sidebar, this would mean there would be a big gap to the right of the box and that it would not be the full width of the page.p  pThis is the code Im using.p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltstyle typetextcssgtsidebar  float right width 250px height 200px border 1px solid red   la  border 1px solid green width 100  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltdiv idcontentgt      ltdiv idsidebargtSidebar with fixed widthltdivgt      ltpgtThe sun is a star.ltpgt     ltpgtIts yellow.ltpgt     ltpgtIts very hot.ltpgt      ltdiv idlagtThis div is next to the sidebar and should bump up right next to its left side, as in, 100 of the page minus the width of the sidebar. It should not overlap the sidebar. This is not something that can just be done automatically with marginright using the width of the sidebar because it might not actually be next to the sidebar on certain screen resolutions.ltdivgt      ltpgtThe sun is a star.ltpgt     ltpgtIts yellow.ltpgt     ltpgtIts very hot.ltpgt      ltdiv idlagtThis div is NOT next to the sidebar on most screen resolutions  it is under it where there is nothing to the right of it, so it should be the full width of the page.ltdivgt   ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pIm hoping theres a way to just make it so that if something is next to the sidebar, such as a table within a div, itll be at the max width of the page minus the width of the sidebar. If its not next to the sidebar, its the full width of the page. I guess I just want everything else to act like text  itll go right up to whatever is to the right of it either the sidebar if its there or the right side of the page if the sidebar is not there.p  pThank you in advance p

Negative 53249 pI have an ASP.NET MVC2 site connecting to a MySQL database via DbLinq.  There is a particular set of actions that get done at regular intervals on the site, which includes looping over a particular set of records in a few tables and updating them, and adding some new records in some other tables.p  pIve been testing with a moderate sized set of data.  In my particular test set right now, on an update it ends up inserting 44 new rows and updating 81 other rows.  But my call to SubmitChanges ends up taking a very long time  34 minutes, which seems like a long time to push what I thought was a relatively small number of changes to the DB.p  pI eventually did some simple profiling, and I found that the problem does not seem to be with executing the query on the database, or even building the query.  The majority of the time seems to be taken up by a call inside of UpdateEntity to AllTrackedEntities.ContainsReference.p  pTo give some actual numbers, from a recent test run I hadp  ul liTime in SubmitChangesImpl 204884 ms ul liTime in UpdateEntity 200908 ms ul liTime in ContainsReference 148173 msli liTime in QueryBuilder.GetUpdateQuery 685 msli liTime in QueryRunner.Update 28 msli liTime in UpdateReferencedObjects 49958 msli ulli ulli ul  pAs you can see, building and running the SQL query is dwarfed by the amount of time spent checking to see if there exists a reference to the entity we are updating if there is no reference, the entity is inserted, although in this case all of the updated entities exist.  While I understand why this happens, to maintain data integrity and so on, this is killing the performance of these regular update operations.p  pI looked at setting ObjectTrackingEnabled to false, but that makes it so the DataContext is readonly, and that is of no use to me  my issue is with the performance on updates specifically.p  pIs there anything that can be done to improve the performance of updates  Am I using DbLinq in a less than optimal way in terms of trying to push through 4050 inserts and 80 updates in a single submit  If so, is there a better way to go about thisp

Negative 53249 pIm working on a multithreaded application in which one thread acts as a tcp server which receives commands from a client.

Heres the codep  precodevoid ServerThreadFunc      using boostasioiptcp     boostasioioservice ioservice     tcpacceptor acceptorioservice, tcpendpointtcpv4, portno      for                 listen for command connection         tcpsocket socketioservice         acceptor.acceptsocket            connected receive command         boostarrayltchar,256gt msgbuf         socket.receiveboostasiobuffermsgbuf            do something with received bytes here       codepre  pThis thread spends most of its time blocked on the call to codeacceptor.acceptcode.  At the moment, the thread only gets terminated when the application exits.  Unfortunately, this causes a crash after main returns  I believe because the thread tries to access the apps logging singleton after the singleton has been destroyed.  It was like that when I got here, honest guv.p  pHow can I shut this thread down cleanly when its time for the application to exit  Ive read that a blocking accept call on a raw socket can be interrupted by closing the socket from another thread, but this doesnt appear to work on a Boost socket.  Ive tried converting the server logic to asynchronous io using the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490dochtmlboostasioexampleechoasynctcpechoserver.cppBoost asynchronous tcp echo server examplea, but that just seems to exchange a blocking call to codeacceptoracceptcode for a blocking call to codeioserviceruncode, so Im left with the same problem a blocked call which I cant interrupt.

Negative 53249 pI am calling the goolge earth api function fetchKml via javascript. When fetching large files firefox gives me a popup that says A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, open the script in the debugger, or let the script continue.p  pI noticed a similar question on google groups issue 331 fetchKml fails on slower connections or fast connections and large KMLKMZ files. Well alas  that issue was in 2009. Now is 2012. How do I progromatically get the file to load without getting the timeout issuep  pThank you.p

Negative 53249 pI am amateur Programmer looking to develop a game. Ive decided to use Python and pygame. I know, there are better options out there, but I really dont know C or java that well. The issue Im having is that I really have no idea how to create a decent AI. Im talking about the sort of AI that has monsters move this way at this point, use a bow and arrow at that point, and use a longrange magic attack at another point yes, its a topdown 2d fantasy game. I really dont understand how it makes those decisions and how you program it to make those decisions. Ive looked around everywhere, and either the resource gets so technical that I cant understand it at all, or it gives me no information whatsoever. Im hoping someone here can give me some clear suggestions, or at least point me to some decent resources. Right now my bots just sort of wander randomly around the screen...p

I have four lists that are associated with each other by index one list stores the course names, one stores the time the class begins in a simple int format ie 130, one stores either am or pm, and one stores the days of the classes by int so MWF evals to 1, TR evals to 2, etc. I dont know if having multiple this is the best or the right way to solve this problem, but these are all the tools I have firstyear comp sci student that hasnt programmed seriously since I was 16. Im writing a function to remove the corresponding element from each lists, and all I know is that 1 the indices correspond and 2 the user inputs the course name. How can I remove the corresponding element from each list using filterNot I dont think I know enough about each list to use higher order functions on them.p

While I can send codenet.Socketcode instances using the a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapichildprocess.htmlchildprocesschildsendmessagesendhandle relnofollowsendmessage, handlea method I cant do the same using the ClearStream class. p  pMight there be a way to rewrap the connected raw socket by serializing the original CleartextStream instancep  pThis is what I want to achieve The master process of a Node.js application is listening for TLS connections. There are a number of certain worker processes which where spawned at startup. A client connected to the master process want to be redirected to ema certainem worker process. Therefore the master should send the socket to the corresponding worker process. This actually works but as the TLS context gets lost the worker process can neither de nor encode data to communicate to the connected client.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQSPUw.png altenter image description herep  pDo you have any idea how this could be realizedp
Negative 53249 pI have a demo app here a hrefhttpsgithub.comrdetertimagetransformtest relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrdetertimagetransformtesta p  pAfter importing an image, you can pinch, zoom, rotate the image. What I want to do is save out a code640x480code image landscape mode that looks identical to the live preview. So if there are 100px bars of empty space on the sides, I need the same empty bars in the final output scaled appropriately.p  pThis is proving to be more difficult than I thought it would be. I cant quite get it to come out right after days of working on it. p  pThe magic method that generates the final image is called codevoidgenerateFinalImagecodep  pGood luck p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1cIq7.png altDemo App Screenshotp  pThe green rectangle represents the actual area the imported image can be pinched, zoomed and rotated. The resolution on the iPhone 4S is 852x640, for example.p  pThe blue rectangle is just a live preview for debugging and its aspect ratio is the same as 640x480. The live preview could get very slow due to Core Image being very slow.p  pWhat I want to do is convert whatever is in the green rectangle to a code640x480code image. Notice the code852x640code is a slightly different aspect ratio than code640x480code too, but that isnt a huge problem.p

Negative 53249 pI use regular stdmap to map jobjects to c objects. The problem with this approach is that it may fail for other types of references, e.g. global references are actually different pointer than regular local references even if they reference the same object. The correct way to compare if two references reference the same object isp  precodeenvgtIsSameObjectjobj1, jobj2 codepre  pSo, my question is whats the correct way to map jobjects to c objects The obvious reply to wrap jobject into some c class that overloads operator and calls IsSameObject isnt the reply that Im looking for. Id like to know if there is way to do it without going back and forth between JVM and native cc for every compare operation.p  pstrongEDITstrong global reference is a jni global reference, and has nothing to do with c references.p  pstrongEDIT2strong Id like to clarify what the problem is with this codep  precodestdmapltjobject, void gt jobjs jobject obj1, obj2 ... some code that sets these obj1 and obj2 to some Java objects.  jobjs[obj1]  new CppPeer CppPeer   jobjs[obj1] OK... ifobjs.findobj2  objs.end    assertobj2  obj1    Heres the problem here a new c CppPeer    created for obj2, but the problem is that     even if obj1  ob2 it doesnt mean that    they actually reference different java objects    On the next line error might happen    jobjs[obj2]  new CppPeer maybe not OK here...  codepre  pThe other problem with IsSameObject is that it makes things pretty nasty and messy. Not only now Id need to keep a pointer to JVM, but also whenever I need to compare jobjects Id need to attach thread etc to get pointer to JNIEnv to be able to check jobjectp  pstrongEDIT3strong Be aware, that according to android docs you cannot even assume that two references reference the same object if they are equal. I dont know how its possible, but theres the part from Androids JNI tips pagep  blockquote   pOne consequence of this is that you must not assume object references   are constant or unique in native code. The 32bit value representing   an object may be different from one invocation of a method to the   next, and strongits possible that two different objects could have the same   32bit value on consecutive calls. Do not use jobject values as keysstrong.p blockquote

Negative 53249 pI currently have a shortest path algorithm that receives as inputs the Graph and a Node of origin, and returns the costs for all nodes in the graph plus the tree precedents for each node.

Negative 53249 pI have a relatively large legacy PerlCGIDBI web application which generates HTML onthefly piece by piece. We are reworking the HTML being produced, to come in to compliance with HTML 5  CSS 3. This would be a good time to move to some sort of template system.

Im rereading the venerable Badger Book to study up on feasibility.p  pMy question is this. Has anyone here migrated old school Perl web code to Template Toolkit Are there any tricks you can share for minimizing the rewriterework needed We have not 100 decided on Template Toolkit, either. If there is an alternative which we should considerp  pWhat problem, specifically, are we trying to solve Were generating invalid HTML and need to clean that up. Since were cleaning, we want to produce fullyvalid HTML 5 and, to the extent practicable, valid CSS3 and Javascript. We use jQuery, jQuery UI widgets, and AJAX via jQuery. We have typical Page Controller MVC architecture except no View layer as such. Wed like to go to some sort of template system but dont want to rewrite everything or much of anything to migrate.p  pThank You Ed Barnard, Cannon Falls MNp

Negative 53249 pWeve been trying to figure out why we only achieve writing speed of 53MBps on UHS104 cards that claim 90MBps. Due to hardware constraints, clock frequency supplied to the card is only 148.5 MHz instead of 208MHz. Does that mean that we should achieve speed of 148.5  48  74.25MBps Or is our caclulation wrong since it assumes that if card guarantees speed of 90MBps on frequency of 208MHz, then it should guarantee speed of 74.25MBps on frequency of 148.5p

Negative 53249 pI have a document library in SharePoint 2010 that several different teams are using for the same purpose.  Each team has their own page that has a filtered view of the document library on it.  The document library also has custom columns. p  pThe issue I am running into is when a team member uploads a document from their page.  They click Add document from their page, and then they browse to the document they want to upload.  This part works perfectly  and the URL specifies the source as the teams page.  However, after a user selects the document and clicks OK, it takes them to the EditForm.aspx page that allows the user to fill in the meta data for the document. This is fine, but now the source URL specifies a view from inside of the document library, and no longer points to the teams page where they came from.  p  pDoes anyone know how I can change this source URL to point to the teams page instead of the document library  Or, does anyone know a workaround for this issue so that a user can upload a document from a page with document library web part on it so that it returns to the page  p  pThanksp

Negative 53249 pIm new to asp.net mvc 4 and I have a question regarding the new asyncawait feature. In a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvc4usingasynchronousmethodsinaspnetmvc4 relnofollowthis tutoriala, the section Performing Multiple Operations in Parallel returns the 3 types of lists Product, Gizmo and Widget as a single view.p  pIm trying to achieve the same sort of UI, except that my 3 lists would be 3 different views. The user would type a value in a searchbox and hit the search button to trigger a call to the asynchronous controller method. But that should return 3 different views, which is I believe not possible.p  pDoes it make sense then to have 3 partial views and to call three different async controller method Would the views then appear on the screen as soon as the controller methods return p

Usual stuff  userid, username etc. p  pI then started using the variables to store certain navigation information.

Negative 53249 pI have went through a myriad of resources including, but not limited to, a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsgandroidopencvLIixgriYSscEZWqxp5O3QJ relnofollowOpenCV4Androids Google groupa, StackOverflow and a hrefhttpanswers.opencv.orgquestion2658staticinitializationproblem relnofollowOpenCVs answersa page trying to resolve this, reaching a point where suggestions become redundant. The problem may be more or less similar to a previous yet to be resolved a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14588578opencvusingandroidndkcouldnotberesolvederrorquestiona of mine, but a different situation and thus perhaps a different source of error. p  pI have added an Android Activity to a package containing a successfullyrunning app OpenCVs tutorial 3 sample demonstrating ndk use. The activity uses OpenCVs java API, but there is a call to codeSystem.loadLibrarynativefilecode where codenativefilecode represents a native library. The block where the codeloadLibrarycode is called is mentioned below it is in the codeonManagerConnectedcode method. At the codeloadLibrarycode line, Logcat emitsp  precode0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872 java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError Library nativefile not found 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872    at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibraryRuntime.java461 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872    at java.lang.System.loadLibrarySystem.java557 codepre  pSuch error indeed did occur multiple times in other questions and I have tried the suggestions I came across. However, there is a noteworthy observation to this problem the app that successfully runs the OpenCV sample calls the same library through codeSystem.loadLibrarynativefilecode. p  pThe code is rather long and thus not helpful to place in the question. However below summarises what I presume are key elements regarding the problem, it also summarises some of the previous answers related to the matter.p  ul liThe .cpp file called has the correct method name, where I verify that it includes the package name and the class name, as well as the method name, in a pattern similar to codeJavapackageNameSeperatedWithUnderScorescallingClassNamemethodNamecode. Morever the code is surrounded within an codeextern Ccode block, as with other OpenCV sample cpp files for native development.li liThe Android manifest is updated to learn that it launches the activity in question.li lipBelow is the codeAndroid.mkcode filep  pcodeLOCALPATH  call mydir include CLEARVARSbr include ....sdknativejniOpenCV.mk LOCALMODULE     nativefilebr LOCALSRCFILES  nativefile.cppbr LOCALLDLIBS   llog ldlbr include BUILDSHAREDLIBRARYcodepli lipBelow is the codeApplication.mkcode filep  pcodeAPPSTL  gnustlstaticbr APPCPPFLAGS  frtti fexceptionsbr APPABI  allcode  pli lipI have tried replacing codeallcode in the codeAPPABIcode line with codearmeabicode and also again tried with codearmeabiv7acode, no different results however. pli liIve also verified, as suggested in a comment a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13385265ndklibrarynotfoundherea, that the apk after being extracted contains the needed code.socode file in codelibcode folder under the various architecture type folders.li lipBelow is the codeBaseLoaderCallBackcode instantiation block, not much unlike that in the OpenCV sample, however I do not call the OpenCV camera, since the app performs image processing on images read from the SD card.p  precode BaseLoaderCallback loader  new BaseLoaderCallbackthis  public void onManagerConnectedint status       switchstatus              case LoaderCallbackInterface.SUCCESS               System.loadLibrarynativefile break            default                super.onManagerConnectedstatus break           codepreli lipUnlike OpenCVs sample however, in the Activity in question the line codeloader.onManagerConnectedLoaderCallbackInterface.SUCCESScode is added to the codeonCreatecode method, since the method codeonManagerConnectedcode didnt seem to be called otherwise. pli liBefore every OpenCV block of statements, the condition codeif OpenCVLoader.initDebugcode is checked. Ive also tried the a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkandroidservicedocJavaHelper.html relnofollowrecommendeda  codeOpenCVLoader.initAsyncOpenCVLoader.OPENCVVERSION243, this, loadercode conditional check, but still no different results.li liAlso, the ndkbuild runs successfully building the code.socode files for the native library codenativefilecode.li ul  pGiven that the other activity, within the same package, load the library and utilises it finely of course after amending the manifest file and cpp method name accordingly, I presume the project properties are correct such as adding OpenCV library, and necessary environment paths, etc. p  pI reviewed the OpenCV sample multiple times and followed the same practice with slight variances, as detailed above. p  pAny ideas what could be the source of the problem   p  pThank you for your time.p

Provide the url for files to be downloaded as strings. Separate the     files to be downloaded by a comma.      The function would download the files and save it in the folder     provided as keywordargument for downloadlocation. If     downloadlocation is not provided, then the file would be saved in     the current working directory. Folder for downloadlocation would be     created if it doesnt already exist. Do not worry about trailing     slash at the end for downloadlocation. The code would take carry of     it for you.

Also the Javas JITcompiling can make a difference.p  pThe if statement introduces branching and additional read that wouldnt happen if we always overwrote var with X, so its bad. On the other hand, if codevar  Xcode then using this optimization we perform only a read and we do not perform a write, which could have some effects on cache. Clearly, there are some tradeoffs here. Id like to know how it looks like in practice. Has anyone done any testing on thisp  pEDITp  pIm mostly interested about how it looks like in a multiprocessor environment. In a trivial situation there doesnt seem to be much sense in checking the variable first. But when cache coherency has to be kept between processorscores the extra check might be actually beneficial.

Negative 53249 pmy problem is about coordinating core datas awareness of changes in objects including relationships with posting this updates to a server.p  pFor examplep  ol lipSay I have a managed object with 2 tomany relationships. I do a get on a server to get the objects contained in both relationships. For relationship A, the server returns that 1 object belongs. For relationship B the server returns theres none. So for A, I parse the JSON response into an NSManagedObject and insert it into relationship A. For B I do nothing. At this point, if I was to query codechangedValuescode in the only object in rel A, Itd say that the inverse of rel A changed for it, since it was inserted into rel A. Since I want the objects fetched from the server to represent the default or last committed state, I issue a core data context save, at which point, changedValues does not reflect the insertion anymore. So far so good.pli lipNext, I locally not by fetching from the server, create 2 objects. I insert one in rel A it now has 2 objects and another on rel B now has 1 object.pli liAt this point, Id like the whole system to be aware of the fact that the first object in rel A was there to start with so nothing needs to be done about it. The second one in A is a new insertion and so it needs to be posted to the server and the third object which is the only one in rel B, is also a new insertion and so needs a POST.li ol  pI tried approaching this by querying the context for all objects of the appropriate relationship destination entity that had a value for valueChanged over the key named after the appropriate relationship[s inverse. That is for some object x with these relationships, the current state isp  precodex.relA  ltNSSet obj1, obj2gt x.relB  ltNSSet obj3gt codepre  pand the query is essentially p  precode For each relationship NSError error  nil         NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNamemapping.entityName]         NSArray fetchResult  [self.context executeFetchRequestfetchRequest erroramperror]     NSArray deletedObjects  [fetchResult filteredArrayUsingPredicate[NSPredicate predicateWithBlockBOOLid evaluatedObject, NSDictionary bindings          id relationship  [evaluatedObject changedValues][ltinverseOfRelationshipgt]         return relationship ampamp [relationship containsObjectx]     ]]      NSArray insertedObjects  [fetchResult filteredArrayUsingPredicate[NSPredicate predicateWithBlockBOOLid evaluatedObject, NSDictionary bindings          id relationship  [evaluatedObject changedValues][ltinverseOfRelationshipgt]         return relationship ampamp [relationship containsObjectx]     ]] codepre  pThis works in principle. But the problem is, say I first evaluate rel A. I get the list of deletions and insertions not counting what was already there by default. and issue the appropriate DELETE and POST to the server for those 2 arrays. So far so good. However, now I issue a coredata context save so that this relationships current state becomes the default state. OK. sure... BUT... the save also wipes out the changes for obj3 in rel B. So if I now try to query that relationship with the above code, obj3s changedValues will not report any value since in theory obj3s membership in rel B is the default since the last save at least.p  pSo I need a way to either do a selective context save for some objects only which I believe is not possible since this is a context save and not an object save, or some way to selectively clear changedValues for the objects Ive already processed with the server, for instance.     p  pAnother approach would be inserting extra updated  deleted flags in the ManagedObjects and handle those manually via my own code. Seems viable but kind of ghetto, since its essentially repurposing flags that managedObjects already have in place in relation to the context.p  pAny thoughts or ideasp

Negative 53249 pI have noticed a strange behaviour when testing my code with jasmine. One test fails when executed together with the other tests in my spec. When called alone the test passes. p  pThe test asserts the script A.js that depends on script B.js which offers the method Create. I create inside the test a spy for the Create and invoke script A.js A.init that will load some data loadData with returns again a promise and then call the Create method 5 times once the loadDatapromise is resolved. The A.init returns another promisep  pWhen I use the runs method of Jasmine and wait until the promiseinit is resolved, I like to assert that B.Create was called 5 times.p  pWhen executing the test some other test in the same spec will set up its own spy for the B.Create method. So I assume this will create somehow a racecondition. p  pAnnotation Each test creates its own spy for the createmethod codevar createSpy  spyOnB, Createcodep  pSo all boils down to the following question p  ul liDo I face a raceconditionli liHow do I prevent this problem The time mock jasmine.Clock.useMock is not a real solution because I mock the loadData method with an promisefake.li ul  pstrongUpdate1strong Richard Dingwall outlines in his article a hrefhttpricharddingwall.name20120428parallelvsserialjavascriptasynctests relnofollowParallel vs serial javascript async testsa that Jasmine executes the tests in parallel, so is this the root of my problemp  pstrongUpdate2strong This is the test that failsp  precode more code   crmRestKitCreateSpy  spyOn CrmRestKit, Create     .andCallFake function  entitySchemaName, obj           return             then function  callback                   fake a create response where the id attribute is populated                callback .extend , obj,  AccountId cloneId                               more code   it links all childclones to the new parentclone, function     arrange  inject spy spyOn CrmRestKit, ByQueryAll .andReturn         alfa.fake.promise.buildFakeResolvePromise  d fakeChildAcccounts, next false , 750     arrange  includedOneToManyRel  [accountToAccountRel]   action  var promise  alfa.util.clonemachine.deepClone fakeId, includedOneToManyRel   waitsFor function       return promise.state  resolved , 800    runs function        expect crmRestKitCreateSpy.callCount .toBe 5        assert  all childclones reference the new parentclone     expect crmRestKitCreateSpy.calls[1].args[1].ParentAccountId.Id .toBe cloneId      expect crmRestKitCreateSpy.calls[2].args[1].ParentAccountId.Id .toBe cloneId      expect crmRestKitCreateSpy.calls[3].args[1].ParentAccountId.Id .toBe cloneId      expect crmRestKitCreateSpy.calls[4].args[1].ParentAccountId.Id .toBe cloneId    codepre  p p  pstrongUpdate3strong I think a found the proof that I am facing a racecondition.

Ive pretty much got the whole iPhone App working for the iPad.  The next step I needed to take was to convert my Events Calendar to be a splitview.

The data across the MISO is expected to be meaningless here. I can produce captures for other instructions if necesssary.p  pFrom top to bottomp  ul liMISOli liMOSIli liSSli liSCLKli ul  pEdit 2 Specifically, what Im trying to do is set the accuracy of the UFDC1 with the instruction 0x020A. The last part of that 0A is the accuracy number. After that, I have a while loop where I try to read that accuracy back. The get accuracy instruction is 0x01FF, where FF is a dummy byte sent in order to read back the accuracy number. Therefore when I send 0x01FF, I expect to be reading back 0A somewhere in the data I get sent back from the UFDC1.p  pEdit 3 a hrefhttpimgur.com2Pwmyww relnofollowHerea is a capture of the SPI lines as I send the get accuracy instruction to the UFDC1 for the first time. The blue line second from top is the MOSI, and it is definitely giving the right command 0x01FF. If this were working properly, the UFDC1 should be replying across the MISO with 0A 0b00001010, which is the accuracy number, during the same time as the MOSI transmits FF. Instead I get 1A transmitted back at that time, and I dont believe that A is actually coming from the UFDC1, but just from the set accuracy instruction 0x020A I sent earlier. This is because I have the get accuracy instruction going in a while loop, and the steadystate value that Im reading back is 0x7F00  nothing to do at all with the accuracy number of the UFDC1.p  pThis is what my output looks likep  precodeInitialising SSP0 and SSP1...

That seems to let the SPI controller interact properly with the UFDC.p  pOne problem remaining is that the SPI clocks in random data on the MISO. For instance, I have a while loop where I expect to get back nothing but 0xedff.

Negative 53249 pI started with a default Windows Forms Application in C and all I changed was Progam.cs. From the main function, I changedp  precodeApplication.Runnew Form1 codepre  ptop  precodeApplication.Runnew MyCustomApplicationContext codepre  pWhich refers to a custom class MyCustomApplicationContextApplicationContext that runs my program as a system tray icon instead of a Windows Form. The constructor contains this codep  precodeprivate NotifyIcon trayIcon  new NotifyIcon trayIcon.ContextMenu  new ContextMenu     new MenuItem[]               new MenuItemExit, Exit      codepre  pThis allows the user to right click the icon, giving them a context menu with an Exit option that will run a function that closes out the program.p  pAt the end of the constructor of MyCustomApplicationContext, I call a recursive function in the class called Update which executes a ping function and changes the system tray icon depending on the ping delay.p  pUnfortunately I believe because its recursive, it isnt allowed to run any other code, so the right click context menu doesnt ever show up. Id rather call the Update function through an event, like the System.Timers.Timer Elapsed event. I just dont know how events work or where to put the code.p
Negative 53249 pI am writing a vba macro that checks that word documents are formatted correctly to meet certain specifications. One of the things I have to check for are the left margins of each line  different paragraphs are supposed to have different first indents and hanging indents depending on the context. This should be as simple as checking the style, but unfortunately it is not  some of the documents use styles to change the indents, but others use manual spaces and tabs to position the text correctly. So I need some way to check the actual physical position of the first physical character in each Document.Paragraphs. I have no problem getting a range with the first visible character in the paragraph, but Im not sure about getting the distance from the margin or from the left side of the page  doesnt make a difference because the margins are consistent.p  pI found the Window.GetPoint method, but Im nervous to use it, because that is based on the actual physical location on the screen. This macro is going to be used on different computers, with different versions of word, and Im not sure about how it is affected by other view settings like print layout, zoom, etc. Is there a consistent way to use this method to determine the distance from the marginp  pThe other method would be because all of the documents are in Courier New 12 to look at the firstindent property of the style, and the count manually all of the spaces and tabs but that would need to take into account tabstops. This Im also not sure how to do. I would think that there should be a much simpler way of doing this, but I cant find it, so if anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate any help.p

Negative 53249 pI am writing a script that takes two strings of the format HHMM as inputs.  These strings are times in hours HH and minutes MM.  I would like to display an error message if the user inputs the wrong format for a time, such as HHMMSS if they think the script can interpret seconds as well. I have it set up to accept negative times, so an input like HHMM will be interpreted correctly. An input like HHHMMM with variable hour and minute sizes is also OK, actually any input of the form ss should be accepted since errors like 530 AM are dealt with later.p  pWhat I need is to test that the inputs are of the form string colon string before reading, is this possible  To make the problem clearer, here is code explaining how I read the inputs time1 and time2p  precode[hour1, min1]  strreadtime1, ss, delimiter,  [hour2, min2]  strreadtime2, ss, delimiter,  codepre  pIf time1 and time2 are formatted wrong, strread throws an unhelpful error.

Negative 53249 pAs learning curve exercise, I am using lex and yacc to convert C header files into something that my Prolog compiler can use to call dlls and extract objs from lib files.

While writing the rules in the yacc portion of my project. How do I write a global rule to catch all of the TOKENS that I have not written rules for yet, so that I can progressively work on my project. Writing and testing each rule. The first thing that I want to work on, is to trap the typedefs and write their associations away to a small lookup table so that later when I process the function and parameter lists I can insert the correct PROLOG primitives. Please note. I am not asking how to write a rule to trap the typedefs. This I have a rough idea how to do. I am asking how to have a global catch all for all the other TOKENs that my lexer is returning to the yaccer, while I am developing my project. In the lexer you normally have an empty function call to do nothing with the text that is being read, like.p  precodeLATER          JUNK           WS            n               .                codepre  pWhat is the YACC equivalent.p

Negative 53249 pI have a method that takes an IOrderedQueryable and ExpressionltFuncltT, V which uses as a filter and page records from a SQL database.p  precodevar query  contexBills.AsNoTracking.Wherex gt x.Completetrue.OrderByx gt x.BillID  var reader  new BulkReaderltBillgtquery, x gt x.BillId, 10000 codepre  pthe bulk reader is used extensively throughout the code to page large volumes of records and process them in batches and is defined like thisp  precodepublic BulkReaderIOrderedQueryableltTgt queryable, ExpressionltFuncltT, Objectgtgt selector, int blockSize  1000 codepre  pFor optimisation paging starts at the minimum value found in the table and ends at the maximum value. As there are many millions of records per month in the database using a Skip.Take approach degrades to around 13 seconds a page when you get to to the high millions in the table and processing the whole months data can then take many hours. p  pGiven that there a very few records in the set that are marked as complete  false then just selecting records  [Page Start] AND lt [Page End] works very quickly at about a million records a minute. In some cases you process slightly less than the blockSize passed in but all records between min and max get processed.p  pAs the months progress the minimum value increases so assuming 0 as minimum wastes a lot of SQL calls that return nothing at all.p  pSo what I have to get these values is p  precodevar min  queryable.Selectselector.DefaultIfEmpty0.Min var max  queryable.Selectselector.DefaultIfEmpty0.Max codepre  pWhich produces SQL that looks like thisp  precodeSELECT  [GroupBy1].[A1] AS [C1] FROM  SELECT  MIN[Join1].[A1] AS [A1] FROM  SELECT      CASE WHEN [Project1].[C1] IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE [Project1].[PrintSummaryID] END AS [A1]     FROM    SELECT 1 AS X  AS [SingleRowTable1]     LEFT OUTER JOIN  SELECT          [Extent1].[PrintSummaryID] AS [PrintSummaryID],          cast1 as tinyint AS [C1]         FROM [dbo].[tblPrintSummary] AS [Extent1]  AS [Project1] ON 1  1   AS [Join1]   AS [GroupBy1] GO codepre  pIf I hand code as a test to make calls like thisp  precodevar min  queryable.Minx gtintx.BillID  0 var max  queryable.Maxx gtintx.BillID  0 codepre  pthen the SQL produced is p  precodeSELECT  [GroupBy1].[A1] AS [C1] FROM  SELECT  MIN[Extent1].[PrintSummaryID] AS [A1] FROM [dbo].[tblPrintSummary] AS [Extent1]   AS [GroupBy1] GO codepre  pThe same can be achieved by declaring the following insteadp  precodeExpressionltFuncltBill, intgtgt selector2  x gt x.BillID codepre  pWhich gives the benefit of the simpler and faster SQL execution and allows the code to becomep  precodevar min  queryable.Selectselector2.Min  0 var max  queryable.Selectselector2.Max  0 codepre  pTaking the approach of explicitly redefining all the selectors and providing overrides for them would mean significant duplication and recoding across the entire applicationp  pHow could I take a the original selector and do a conversion to the nullable version equivalent generically rather then having to explicitly code each one. p  precodevar selector2  selector.NullableExpression codepre  pId like to to this as an extension method NullableExpression on ExpressionltFuncltT, V so that I return a ExpressionExpressionltFuncltT, NullableltV and that way I could use it in other locations throughout my code to.p  pIm struggling with how I can convert the V to a Nullable or V in an expression.p

Every time you send data, no matter how small, the radio is powered on for up for 2030 seconds. Every decision you make should be based on minimizing the number of times the radio powers up. Battery life can be dramatically improved by changing the way your apps handle data transfers. Users want their data now, the trick is balancing user experience with transferring data and minimizing power usage. A balance is achieved by apps carefully bundling all repeating and intermittent transfers together and then aggressively prefetching the intermittent transfers.p blockquote  pI would like to modify code.ajaxcode to add an option like doesnt need to be done emright nowem, just do this request when another request is launched.

Negative 53249 pOK. This is my first post ever, and also Im programming my first serious webpage, so this has been quite an experience. I ran into a annoying problem when I was coding a Gallery. p  pCode explained  The first thing I did was get the src directory from the logo of the website. Once he got it, the code proceeds to obtain the length of the directory string, and then go back 2 slashes in the directory to obtain the location of the files ergo, the webpageserver directory, but this works for anyplace you have the code, being the desktop or the server. Once extracted the location, the code proceeds to merge all the location strings into a new variable called locationNew, which now contains 1. the location extracted before, 2. the folder which is the location variable passed in the function, 3. the progresion, which is the number of the image in the folder, and 4. the file type.br  Now, HERE is where it gets interesting. This locationNew string is passed to a function called fileExists which executes the Http request. If it finds the file, it returns true, if not, false.br  When Im working in dreamweaver it works perfectly, but when I use the website on the server, it ALWAYS returns 200, so it returns TRUE, when actually the file doesnt exists, so the gallery goes on forever when it should stop loading pictures when it finds the last picture, 13.png.  p  precodefunction galeriaposicion, locacion       var pho1document.getElementByIdfoto1     var pho2document.getElementByIdfoto2     var pho3document.getElementByIdfoto3     var pho4document.getElementByIdfoto4          var logo  document.getElementByIdlogoImagen         var direccionLogo  logo.src             var longitudString0           var slashes0           longitudStringdireccionLogo.length            var numeroAislado           var blanco                  whileslashes2                        longitudString             ifdireccionLogo.charAtlongitudString                              slashes                                                                          var direccionWhole           var blanco             whilelongitudString gt 0                        direccionWhole  blanco.concatdireccionLogo.charAtlongitudString,direccionWhole             longitudString                               var progresionposicion         var numeroArchivo0         var distanciaLeft72         var imgPho1           whileprogresionposicion4                               var locacionNew  direccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                     var existe  fileExistslocacionNew                    ifexistetrue                                          ifimgPho1                                                  pho1.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                              ifimgPho2                                                  pho2.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                              ifimgPho3                                                  pho3.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                              ifimgPho4                                                  pho4.srcdireccionWholelocacionprogresion.png                                                             else                                          ifimgPho1                                                  pho1.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                              ifimgPho2                                                  pho2.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                              ifimgPho3                                                  pho3.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                              ifimgPho4                                                  pho4.srcdireccionWholelocacion0.png                                                                    imgPho              numeroArchivo             distanciaLeft178             progresion                 function fileExistsurl           ifurl                       var req             ifwindow.XMLHttpRequest              Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE7                 reqnew XMLHttpRequest                          else              IE5, IE6                 reqnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                          req.openGET, url, false             req.send             return req.status200                   else                           return false            codepre  pI was going to include pictures of the gallery but i need 10 reputation to include them.........p  pAnyway, Ill leave the description to give an idea, a very vague idea.p  hr  pThis is how it looks The 1,2,3,4 black squares are actually files this code finds perfectly. p  pand this is how it looks normally when it reaches the end, at file 13.png. The Red Squares are files named 0.png, that the code assigns when it doesnt find the picture of the progresion variable. p  pBUT, when I test the gallery from the server, it looks like this. The code always receive a TRUE in the http request function, so it assigns a false directory to the DIV container, pointing to a 16.png that doesnt exists.p  pIf I click the right black vertical bar, which is another function that obtains the number from the last picture which normally is 0 but now its 16, it goes on pointing to nonexistent pictures.p  pMy theory is that the 404 page setting from the GoDaddy hosting server is messing with the 404 signal and is considering that 404 page as if the picture actually exists and returns a 200 status. But as I said, its just a theory. p  hr  pIf anyone knows this issue or if it happened to you before, please comments, its literally driving me insane.p

My solutions that I can see seem to be writing hardcoded interpretation code that assigns each tag value to an exact field with the textgeneral settings or creating the fields on the fly, which doesnt seem much different from dynamic fields.  I would love to figure out how to get dynamic fields to work as I expect them to.p  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 53249 pIs there any .net IOC container that has threadsafe type registrations  p  pI have many dozens of bindings that are fixed for the life of the application  but there are a few registrations that need to be adjusted on a perthread or perrequest basis.  When the threads of this app are recycled tofrom the thread pool, the small handful of dynamic IOC registrations would be cleared or overwritten as new requests are dispatched. p  pTo clarify, below is Unitybased sample code that combines a WCF service with the idea of a container module or registry. p  precodepublic class AccountServiceRegistry  UnityContainerExtension, IBindingOverride      From UnityContainerExtension     protected override void Initialize               Container.RegisterTypeltIAccountService, AccountServicegt           From IBindingOverride     public void ReInitializeIUnityContainer child, string action, object[] parms          child.RegisterTypeltAccountServicegtnew InjectionPropertylog, new InjectionPropertydao          child.AddNewExtensionltDataAccessRegistrygt          string connectionString  action  GetMoreData  Alpha  Bravo          child.ConfigureltIDataAccessConfiggt.WithConnectionconnectionString       codepre  pIn this sample, the codeAcccountServiceRegistycode method codeInitializecode would be called once for the life of the application, but the codeReInitializecode would be called with each WCF service request.  The codeReInitializecode is given the name of the WCF operation that will execute, along with the parameters that will be supplied.  After codeReInitializecode completes, one last Unity codeBuildUpcode call is made on the service instance, and then the service operation executes.p  pAs the example further illustrates, the info about the service call is used to determine what DB connection string the DataAccess instance will be instantiated with. p  pTo create this behavior, I originally planned on creating a Unity child container for each request that needed unique bindings.  This is why the codeReInitializecode call has a childContainer parameter passed in.  But then I discovered that codeCreateChildContainercode itself does not appear to be thread safe.  Indeed Ive found it difficult to find the threadsafety claims for any of the .net IOC containers except for a hrefhttpscode.google.compautofacwikiConcurrency relnofollowAutofac, which makes it rather cleara.p  pI suspect that a container allowing threadsafe registrations would make use of a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd28718928vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowConcurrentDictionarya or a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combdotnetarchive20130925immutablecollectionsreadyforprimetime.aspx relnofollowimmutable collectionsa.  Well see.p  pOn the other hand, if I absolutely had to avoid this dynamic, multithreaded registration process  I suppose I would make typetodelegate registrations instead of typetotype registrations.  This way the delegate could make a dynamic decision of what to create instead of the binding itself being dynamic.  In that case the prior example code would move all registrations from the codeReInitializecode method into the codeInitializecode method, and the codeIDataAccessConfigcode implementation would change to look like thisp  precodepublic class DataAccessRegistry UnityContainerExtension, IDataAccessConfig      [ThreadStatic]     string connection      protected override void Initialize              Container.RegisterTypeltIDataAccessgtnew InjectionFactoryc gt new DataAccessconnection           public IDataAccessConfig WithConnectionstring connection              this.connection  connection         return this       codepre  pThe key part for the above sample, is the code[ThreadStatic]code which ensures multiple threads can call codeWithConnectioncode safely.p  pBut this doesnt change my question  is there a .net container that has threadsafe registrations  p

Negative 53249 pMy original plan was to use a split view controller to have a table view and a generic view beside it for an iPad app. Then I realized I could not use a split view controller as a child controller. So, Ive been experimenting with using a table view controller instead, and Ive got pretty good results so far. Essentially, Im using the tableviews header view as a container for the various views Ill be using depending on which row is selected. The only unresolved issue is that images for a website are not displayed in the UIWebView the first time it is presented. If I tap another table row that displays a web view, it displays fine. And if I tap the original one again, it displays fine, too.p  pIt doesnt matter which one I tap first. Its always the first one that doesnt display images. Instead of displaying the images, it displays the names of the image files.p  pWhen I tried the analogous thing with a split view controller, I didnt have this problem.p  pAny ideas what I should be looking for Or is there something I need to be doing that I must not be doingp  pIf it matters, the page being loaded is just a thumbnail page on a remote server, created with Irfanviews HTML thumbnail page generator.p  pP.S. After further testing, it is really the very first presentation only that doesnt work as expected. By very first, I mean the first per app session. The codeUIWebviewcode is presented as a subview of the table header. The tableview controller is presented as a popover from a button of another controller that is presented when a user taps an image. Even if I dismiss all these layers of controllers, etc., if I instantiate them again, the codeUIWebViewcode displays properly.p  pThis suggests possibly loading a dummy codeUIWebViewcode before starting, but that seems kludgy.p  pIm getting exactly one call to codewebViewDidStartLoadcode and exactly one call to codewebViewDidFinishLoadcode and no calls to codewebViewdidFailLoadWithErrorcode.p  pKLUDGE The kludge works. Here it isp  pIn my table view controller, I create a boolean property codeURLHasBeenRequestedcode and set it to codeNOcode in viewDidLoad. Then I ask for a reload thusp  precodevoidwebViewDidFinishLoadUIWebView webView     if self.URLHasBeenRequested        On first pass, try a second request.

Negative 53249 pI am making a wizard style script for people to quickly create formulaic slide images from text data files, I have two scripts one to create the imagesas layers from data and one to export the images as PNGs. to make this simple as possible for the user Id like it to export all data and images into the same folder, so far Ive manually saved the psd into the directory that I have the other data files and have the exporter check to see if the document is saved and if it is to saveAs all the images to the same directory, if not it throws a message alerting the user to save the document.p  pHowever this intermittent saving is not ideal, because the user must navigate twice to the same folder if they want to save the images in the same place, so I thought Id make the slide creator script save the presave document before the user has the opportunity to make edits that way when they go to save their changes it will default to the same folder as the text data file.p  pthe problem when I run the script the saveAs works, saves a file, but then going to the export script it throws a message that the document hasnt been saved. Sure enough I look at the title tab and it doesnt have my filename and still has an  beside itp
Negative 53249 pId like to access some files on a SDcard using a modern Android phone e.g. Nexus 5.p  pSince the SDcard slot is missing on modern phones usually, I found a solution in using a USB SDcard adapter.

Negative 53249 pIm using pthreads to try and parallelize Dijkstras pathfinding algorithm, but Im running into a deadlock scenario I cant seem to figure out. The gist of it is that every thread has its own priority queue where it gets work a stdmultiset and a mutex lock corresponding to that queue that is locked whenever it needs to be modified.  p  pEvery node has an owner thread which corresponds to the node ID modulo thread count. If a thread is looking through a nodes neighbors and updates one of their weights label to something lower than it was before, it locks its owners queue and removesreinserts this is to force the set to update its position in the queue. However, this implementation seems to deadlock. I cant tell why though because as far as I can tell, each thread holds only one lock at a time.  p  pEach threads initial queue contains all of its nodes, but every nodes weight besides the source is initialized to ULONGMAX. If a thread is out of work its getting nodes with ULONGMAX weight from the queue it just keeps locking and unlocking until another thread gives it work.  p  precodevoid Dijkstralocalownerworkervoid param   struct threadargs myargs  struct threadargs param    int tid  myargsgttid   stdmultisetltNode ,cmplabelgt Q  myargsgtQ    struct threadargs allargs  struct threadargs paramtid    AdjGraph G  AdjGraph allargs[threadcount].Q   struct Node n, p   int owner   stdsetltEdgegtiterator it   Edge e    pthreadmutexlockampmyargsgtmutex   whileQgtempty     n  Qgtbegin QgteraseQgtbegin     pthreadmutexunlockampmyargsgtmutex      ifngtlabel  ULONGMAX       pthreadmutexlockampmyargsgtmutex       Qgtinsertn       continue          for it  ngtedgesgtbegin it  ngtedgesgtend it       e  it       p  GgtgetNodee.dst       owner  intpgtindex  threadcount       ifpgtlabel gt ngtlabel  e.weight         pthreadmutexlockampallargs[owner].mutex         allargs[owner].Qgterasep         pgtlabel  ngtlabel  e.weight         pgtprev  n         allargs[owner].Qgtinsertpupdate ps position in the PQ         pthreadmutexunlockampallargs[owner].mutex                 pthreadmutexlockampmyargsgtmutex      pthreadmutexunlockampmyargsgtmutex   return NULL  codepre  pHeres the function that spawns the threads.p  precodebool DijkstralocalownerAdjGraph G, struct Node src   GgtsetAllNodeLabelsULONGMAX   struct threadargs args[threadcount1]   srcgtlabel  0   struct Node n   forint i0 iltthreadcount i     args[i].Q  new stdmultisetltNode ,cmplabelgt     args[i].tid  i     pthreadmutexinitampargs[i].mutex,NULL       forunsigned long i  0 i lt Ggtn i     n  GgtgetNodei give all threads their workload in advance     args[ngtindexthreadcount].Qgtinsertn      args[threadcount].Q  stdmultisetltNode ,cmplabelgt G   hacky repackaging of a pointer to prevent use of globals   please note this works and is not the issue.

Negative 53249 pI need a string pool object into which I can repeatedly insert a sequence of chars I use this phrase to mean string without confusing it with stdstring or a C string, obtain a pointer to the sequence, and be guaranteed that the pointer will not become invalidated ifwhen the pool needs to grow.  Using a simple codestdstringcode as the pool wont work, because of the possibility for the string to be reallocated when it outgrows its initial capacity, thus invalidating all previous pointers into it.  p  pThe pool will not grow without bound  there are welldefined points at which I will call a codeclearcode method on it  but I dont want to reserve any maximum capacity on it, either.  It should be able to grow, without moving.p  pOne possibility Im considering is inserting each new sequence of chars into a codeforwardlistltstringgtcode and obtaining codebegingtcstrcode. Another is inserting into an codeunorderedsetltstringgtcode, but Im having a hard time finding out what happens when an unorderedset has to grow.  The third possibility Im considering less enthusiastically is rolling my own chain of 1K buffers into which I concatenate the sequence of chars.  That has the advantage I guess of having the highest performance, which is a requirement for this project.p  pId be interested in hearing how others would recommend approaching this.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strong edited to clarify my use of the phrase sequence of chars to be equivalent to the general notion of a string without implying either stdstring or nullterminated char array.p

Negative 53249 pI keep running into codeInvalidAuthenticityTokencode errors with an app Im working on at the moment. I use rollbar to track all the errors and in each case the user sends an HTTP XCsrfToken Header. The requests are all AJAX requests sent using vanilla jQuery with jqueryujs. Users frequently have multiple tabs open at once  not sure if this could have anything to do with it.p  pIve looked at the source code in rails that validates the authenticity tokens and I cant see any reason they would become invalid unless the session somehow expired.p  pAny ideas as to why I keep running into this issue would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 53249 pI have searched for days on this one, poked around in the modauthkerb source and experimented a lot, to no avail, so Im really hoping that someone can point me in the right direction on this one...p  pIve worked for years with ApacheAuthCookie on apache 1.x and apache 2.x 2.2.x mostly and recently developed a single signon solution using AuthCookie for authz only this time and modauthpubtkt for authentication against an AD back end over LDAP.  It all works great, and now Im looking at adding Kerberos to the mix for Windows users who are logged into the AD domain before launching their web browsers. Thats working keytab generated for my single signon server, which can now validate Kerberos tickets sent to it via users browsers and Apache but I need to make it optional.  That is, I need to set up Apache 2.2.x so that if the Kerberos header isnt there to check, theres no error or challenge created IE, for example, prompts for credentials, which I dont want.p  pIn my SSO CGI code, I basically want to see if ENVREMOTEUSER is populated by modauthkerb and act accordingly if it is, and if it isnt, do what I do now ask for the users creds in a form, authen to an LDAP server and continue that way.p  pI thought that this would workp  precodeltLocation whatevergt    AuthName DualExp    AuthType Kerberos    KrbAuthRealms mumble    KrbServiceName HTTPmumbleblah    Krb5Keytab etcapache2my.krb5tab    KrbMethodNegotiate on    KrbMethodK5Passwd off    KrbLocalUserMapping on    KrbAuthoritative off    require validuser    AuthType SiteNullAuth    PerlAuthenHandler SiteNullAuthgtalways ltLocationgt codepre  pWhere SiteNullAuth is a really simple modperl authen handler that just returns OK always.p  pWith modauthkerbs KrbAuthoritative set to off, it looks like SiteNullAuth is getting called all the time, not just on failure ie. no Kerberos header for modauthkerb, which was the first surprise.  That would be fine if the user, as set by modauthkerb on success, wasnt seemingly unavailble to SiteNullAuth.  Since NullAuth gets called last, I end up with no user set ever.

Negative 53249 pI had a hard time formulating this question, which may be why I havent found a solution Im happy with yet.p  pFurther explanation I have a scheme which I run through with jaxws in 2 different occations but the same version of the library. One is input to my service and the other is the output yes, the same for nowp  pI get the same structure, lets say this is what I getp  precode1st generation package package1 public class Object1     int number     getters and setters   2nd generation package package2 public class Object2     int number     getters and setters  codepre  pHow would I go about to set objects from the 2 classes to eachother Object1  Object2p  pIn my case, the classes are the same name. I havent used reflection before, and from what Ive read it would be a mistake to use it in this particular service due to performance requirements.  If there is some way to modify the classes to implement a common interface, it would probably work.p

Negative 53249 pI have a pretty robust web application implementing the latest Knockout.js binding framework. Many of my observables are computed arrays and there are many computed aggregate totals. The page renderings are as optimized as I could get them, using a variety of different templating methods to display the various groupings of objects. p  pEverything is working great in the latest browsers, but not in IE810.p  pThis issues boils down to a memory consumption problem.p  pIt makes IE use 600MB of memory  just loading it. When we switch views new URLs entirely. There are moments when memory doesnt get released, and it just climbs and climbs until it runs out. Just switching back and forth a few times between these pages, I can make IE use 2GB easily, and this is with IE10 as well. The problem is only worse in IE8.p  pThe code base is simply too large to publish as examples. If anyone has had any experiences in the past with this Id love to hear more about how you went about fixing some of the issues and if there are certain usages which I need to avoid for the sake of compatibility.p  pI am using some mapping features of the new Projections library in addition to common mapping functions and knockout utilities.p  pThanks for reading and any of your thoughts.p

Negative 53249 pI have a problem of efficiency in my project which uses Camel with the a hrefhttpcamel.apache.orgesper.html relnofollowEsper componenta. p  pI have several external datasources feeding information to camel endpoints.

Furthermore, I am not sure if I can use a SEDA endpoint at all, because I believe although I am not completely sure that the syntax for an endpoint like code.tosedaespersessionXconcurrentConsumers10code is invalid for Camel.p  pSo, at this point I am quite lost and I dont know what to do  Is SEDA the solution I am looking for  If yes, how do I integrate it with the Esper endpoint given the syntax problem  Are there any other solutions  Camel components that could fix my problemp

Negative 53249 pSo Ive got a Rail application that is being served up a via ApacheSQL.  The main website sits are www.railswebsite.com but also serves up flat data as JSON through its API.  Now I want to set up an Angular app that lives on the same domain at www.railswebsite.comangularp  pMy question is, would it be possible to just send the user to the rails app login page to set the cookie, redirect them to the angular app, and then just read the cookie within the Angular app to authenticate  p  pIf so, is there an easy method for checking if a logged in state is set via the cookie and then using the ID to call the JSON file from the rails API I have set up  p  pIm very green to Angular so Im not really sure what the best approach would be or if something like this would even be possible.  I figured using the already set cookie from the rails app would makes things a lot easier since Im on the same domain already.  Thanksp

The function checkParameters accepts 2 parameters, array with input parameters that will need to be validate and the other parameter is redirectto for the route where i want to redirect.  I call the function checkParameters inside function authenticate. The problem is, if the validator does not run, it means that some fields are empty, i want to redirect that function. But problem occurs when the function redirects but it does not stop execution, it continues to excecute authentication function, makes api request without parameters. How can i redirect and stop the function, to not execute the rest of the code. I want something similar like thisp  precodeRedirecttoredirecttogtsend die codepre

Negative 53249 pI have an Acl that i am trying to implement on my site which is database driven. I have used this code here a hrefhttpwww.developerfiles.comcreatingaclwithdatabaseinzendframework relnofollowcreating ACL with databasea. I am using a module based structure and this example happens to not be. So i placed everything that is supposed to go in application model, in the core module model. This script authenticates everyone that views the site and if they do not have a account it logs them in as guest. My issue is that it authenticates the user as Guest but i am getting an error on the mapper getbyId, it has the user id as 1 guest why is it returning and error Is it something with the module based structure i am using p  pI tried posting on the site itself but have not gotten an answer yet, it was developed a while ago  blog might be dead.   p  pthank you for your help Updated 644 EST May 2ndp  pI think my problem lies here p  precode    private static function getAuthAdapterloginFieldlogin              dbAdapter  ZendDbTablegetDefaultAdapter         authAdapter  new ZendAuthAdapterDbTabledbAdapter         authAdaptergtsetTableNameusers         gtsetIdentityColumnloginField         gtsetCredentialColumnpassword         gtsetCredentialTreatmentMD5CONCAT,salt         return authAdapter      codepre  pI already have an established data connection through my application.ini and Bootstrap.p  precode    protected function initDatabases          thisgtbootstrapmultidb     resource  thisgtgetPluginResourcemultidb     databases  ZendRegistrygetconfiggtresourcesgtmultidb     foreach databases as name gt adapter              dbadapter  resourcegtgetDbname         ZendRegistrysetname, dbadapter           codepre  pSo now the question would be  How do i change the getAuthAdapter to use what i already havep  pthanks againp  pUpdated 938 EST May 3rdp  pThe above now is not an issue. actually it never was. As i dug further, when i created the Guest User it did not encrypt the password and did not add salt. So now i am logged in but still have same error.  This error comes from not getting the roleid.p  precodeif authgthasIdentity    auth  ZendAuthgetInstance    roleid  authgtgetIdentitygtroleid    echo Role Id  . roleid exit     else       echo No Identity exit     codepre  pThe above returns  Role Id   So i have Identity why can i not get roleid  where roleid is the column name. p  pthanks again. p  pUpdated 1017 May 3 For every ones knowledge. This is fixed. I have not explanation other than it was in some kinda of funk. I cleared the identity and it logged back on as Guest and the site came up. p  pSo problem solved for me. This is a really great script so if you are looking for a data driven ACL dont hesitate to use the link above. p  pthanks p

I couldnt find a way to append the newest tag onto the last one in a loop add the value to the end of the elements. p  pThis is what I currently have as a quick fix to get the program running. p  precodeDocument doc  docBuilder.newDocument     Element rootElement  doc.createElementJAVA     doc.appendChildrootElement      Iterator it  hm.entrySet.iterator     while it.hasNext               Map.Entry entry  Map.Entry it.next         String keyString  Stringentry.getKey         String val  Stringentry.getValue         java.util.ListltStringgt sa  Arrays.asListkeyString.split.

Negative 53249 pI am working on a CRM solution for outlook in c in Visual Studio.  I have added a ribbon in the inspector window that is used for modifying contact information.  The CRM system uses a seperate program determines whether the contact has been edited by checking the contact.User2 field string.  Currently, when an inspector window is opened for a contact, a write event is initialized for that ContactItem and when the user clicks save, contact.User2 is set to true.  This method works perfectly when the information is modified in the full inspector window.  My problem is that when in people view, if the user double clicks a contact, Outlook gives an editable preview of the contacts information.  I need a way to set User2 to true whenever a contacts information is saved, not just when a contact window is opened.p  pI tried the following             foreachOutlook.ContactItem person in searchFolder                              contact  person                 contact.Write  new ItemEvents10WriteEventHandlerWritten             p  precode    private void Writtenref Boolean SavePlease              MessageBox.ShowWritten   contact.FullName         contact.User2  true      codepre  pThe messagebox is for debug purposes.  This event will fire once, but will list the first contact in my lists name, not the person I saved info for. If it is relevant, after an inspector window has been opened for a contact, the write event is initialized and the preview view of the contact being saved then sets User2 to true.  Any help or guidance is appreciated, thank you  Outlook 2013.p

As many of our systems are old and slow I updated this with an animated gif which drastically improved the responsiveness and page scrolling of the browser. p  pI then discovered that the majority of our users, who access the site through a terminal server, have internet explorer animations disabled through a group policy. Therefore they cant see the animating gif. Its hopeless asking the admins to enable this, they just cite performance issues etc. Is there any html code I can use to trick IE into allowing this image to animate If not, what is the best least processor  memory intensive way of displaying an animation if I cant use a gif p

Negative 53249 pIm working in c trying to implement 2 classes that use the same interface. Both classes only require one method each. However the two methods need to be of different types, taking different parameters. I would really like to be able to inherit one single method from the interface and overwrite it in each class as this would be nice and neat the interface is necessary for the program functionality working with dependency injection Unfortunately both classes are also necessary as the email sender class will be used repeatedly in other programs.p  pI have found a solution which ALMOST fits my problem, it is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16131410implementingmethodsfromaninterfacebutwithdifferentparametersImplementing methods from an interface but with different parametersap  pThe difference that I have is that each of my two classes should only call one method.p  pHere is my code as it stands having tried to implement the generics in the previous solutionp  precodeinterface IEmailSenderltTgt       T DoEmail   public class EmailGenerator  IEmailSenderltMailMessagegt       public override MailMessage DoEmailstring emailAddress                MailMessage message  new MailMessage          code to generate email message          return message         public class EmailSender  IEmailSenderltboolgt      public override bool DoEmailMailMessage message              code to send email         return true       codepre  pIdeally Id like my email sender method to be void but I dont mind it returning a boolean if it has to have a return value.p  pHope that makes sense, Im literally just trying to be neat here because currently in order to make it work, I would need to have two methods in my interface and have each class call an empty method.p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 53249 pI have a json file. I am getting all the contents using filegetcontents and putting the content in a variable called js. Then I am appending new data or maybe delete some data from the js variable. Then I am overwriting the data to the json file using fileputcontents. But many user will use it. Is there any way to synchronize it. Like when one user has used filegetcontents, until he overwrites it other users will have to wait. I am thinking something like semaphore. As far as I understand flock will not work since I am not opening the json file to read and write. Please help me. Thanks in advance.p

Ive also got some logging to show me whats going on with the session variables, and thats pretty much showing nothing as well. Theres a passport variable in the cookie info, but its empty.p  pIm guessing that my problem lies in the fact that Im not using the default mechanism of redirecting that passport is supposed to use by default, but so far Ive been unable to figure out what it is exactly. My second guess would be that the cookie and session stuff isnt getting set up properly. The scotch.io tutorial was written for a much older version of express and Ive had to make changes to bring everything up to date.p

Negative 53249 pI have tried presenting a view controller in a popover using the old iOS 7 and new iOS 8 ways, yet when my VC is presented in the popover it has some extra space on the side because its frames size is being set to 13 pt wider. Why p  pstrongMore detailsstrongp  pIt appears fine in the iOS7 simulator when written the old way. p  pI have realized that the 13 pt is probably the size of the arrow when you force the arrow to be Up or Down then it adds the 13 pt to the height instead of the width.p  pI did some further inspection by setting a breakpoint in the codesetFramecode of my view and found that there is a codeUIPopoverPresentationControllercode method codepresentationTransitionWillBegincode which calls codesetFramecode with the bad frame.

Negative 53249 pI am building up a Magento eCommerce website, and importing customer profiles from old one. I am using CSV importer, and this process is way slower than I can imagine. It takes almost 4 seconds for just one customer. So far the process has been running for 6 hours and only 30k customers imported. The CSV file is chunked into several 10M smaller ones. p  pFor now, I am using Amazon Web Services EC2 instance micro for development server. It has 1 vCPU 2.5GHz and 1GiB memory. But I dont think this can be an issue. I increased php memory limit to 1G. p  pIve read an article saying that this speed issues of importing products are very common because of the Magentos EAV database system and the heavy PHP API modules [a hrefhttpswww.byte.nlblogspeedingupmagentoimportsenglish relnofollowSpeeding up Magento Importsa]. It says that Magento sends 450 MySQL queries in order to import one single product. I have also seen a workaround using [a hrefhttpwiki.magmi.orgindex.phptitleMainPage relnofollowMagmia] which tries to bypass Magentos API and insert data directly into MySQL tables. However AFAIK it doesnt seem to import customers, but only products and categories. I dont know if they products and customers are using the same mechanism.p  pI disabled caching management and set the option of index management to manual update. Though customer profiles dont really use these processes.p  pDo you have any suggestion to increase this CSV importing speedp  p[Followup]p  pI have found one of the problem sources, Amazon EC2 T2 instances. They use CPU Credits to control maximum CPU usage. For micro instances, the base CPU performance is limited to 10 of its capacity. I used all of the CPU credits, and the server didnt allow me to use the full CPU. p  pI just checked the importing performance now, and it is importing approximately 2 records per sec. I think this is still too slow, so I will wait more for any other solutions. Perhaps optimizationsp

I give this to my application where I have a factory which will generate or wrap this into some new object for my display purpose with some additional properties.  p  pNow for my search feature of this application to work I also add these objects into a ternary tree based on the name field of each object.  p  pNow this works fine, and I can search as well.  p  pAfter some time lets say 3 hours I get the next set of data, with some objects dropped and some new objects added.   p  pRight now I am simply adding the new set to the tree, and the search still works.  p  pThis sequence will be continued for the full 24 hours and I am fearing that the old references still lie in the tree and it may create a memory leak.  p  pOn every update, for the dropped objects, the real object wrapped by the UI object for these has been made null, but still how will I tell my tree to drop these objects.  p  pThe only option I am having is  p  ul liUse a dual Tree mechanism and drop the old tree when the new one is ready.li liOn every update, clear the tree and create a new one for the current data.li ul  pBut, I just want to know if it is possible to to drop the old objects and add the new objects as and when required without clearing the complete tree  p  pWill weak references be of any help  p  pThanks,br Senp

Negative 53249 pTypically with Browserify, if you want to combine a number of files, you run something like the followingp  precodegulp.taskbuildtests, function      var b  browserify                 entries [.libsomespecs.js, .libsomemorespecs.js]                   b.bundle.pipesourcespecs.js.pipegulp.dest.dist  codepre  pI want to replace entries with a dynamically created filtered list of files, so that instead of having to update the array every time I add a new file I want Browserified, it would do this automatically.p  pTo do this, I started to use gulpfilter to select the files I wish to browserify from the folderp  precodegulp.srclib.js     .pipegulpFilterspecs.js     .pipeconcatspecs.js  codepre  pBut because this returns an asynchronous stream rather than an array, you cant use this inplace of entries. Then I thought that I could concatenate the separate files into the one virtual file, and then pass this into Browserify.

Negative 53249 pFor my portfolio website I am using my name as the logo and I thought why not be a bit more innovative and creative and instead of making my name use my initials and onmousehover have initials expand in a specific order. p  pFor example If I used TTS as the logo and on hover have the TTS Logo expand to Text To Speech and when the mouse is not hovering have it revert to TTS. In my head I would like a typewriter effect where TTS is stationary and onhover have Tstrongextstrong Tstrongostrong Sstrongpeechstrong where the bold and the space are added when hovered. I tried googling this issue in a few different ways and was not able to find any results. If anyone has any suggestions on how I can solve this problem I would greatly appreciate the help. I have used both javascript, and jquery on my website so either would work for me. It is based off of a HTML5 and CSS with very minimal PHP code along with the javascript and jquery aspect. So I should be able to implement most solutions if anyone has any ideas.p

Negative 53249 pJust to make sure I understand the concepts presented in java concurrency in practice.p  pLets say I have the following programp  precodepublic class Stuff     private int x      public Stuffint x         this.xx           public int getXreturn x   public class UseStuff     private Stuff s      public void makeStuffint x         snew Stuffx           public int useStuff         return s.getX       codepre  pIf I let multiple threads to play with this code, then Im not only in trouble because s might be pointing to multiple instances if two or more threads are entering to the makeStuff method, but even if just one thread creates a new Stuff, then an other thread who is just entered to useStuff can return the value 0 predefined int value or the value assigned to x by its constructor.p  pThat all depends on whether the constructor has finished initializing x.p  pSo at this point, to make it thread safe I must do one thing and then I can choose from two different ways.p  pFirst I must make makeStuff atomic, so s will point to one object at a time.p  pThen I either make useStuff synchronized as well which ensures the I get back the Stuff object x var only after its constructor has finished building it, OR i can make Stuffs x final, and by this the JMM makes sure that xs value will only be visible after it has been initialized.p  pDo I understand the importance of final fields in the context of concurrency and JMM p

Negative 53249 pIve been working for the past two or so weeks on a forfun project, a game. As of right now, Ive just gotten to a point where the releases are stable, and there arent any bugs. Except one. And it is very annoying  especially since I have no idea what is happening.p  pEssentially, I use SFMLs isKeyPressed function to check if a key is pressed, and the EventKeyPressed event to check for key releases. p  pbThe bug is that if the player is moving key is held down, and the user moves the mouse, and while the mouse is moving releases the key key is no longer pressed, the player will continue moving, until something explicitly blocks him from doing so. bp  pThis series of events is reproducible, so it shouldnt be my code, but rather, the way SFML processes events.p  pDoes anyone know any good solutions to this problem brAnd somewhat related to this  if a user holds the game window, the game freezes, and Id really like that this didnt happen. brbr If any code is needed, or more details Screenshots, etc, Id be happy to provide. Thank youp

Negative 53249 pI would like to create a simple framework for throwing and catching events in a game. Events could be things like a codeCollisioncode which according to the type can take several arguments note that every Event type may take another amount of arguments, not just two as in the example.p  pI would then like to implement functionsclasses... to deal with a codeCollisioncode, based on polymorphism. This example should illustrate the problemp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt  class Entity   class Player public Entity   class Bomb public Entity  public     bool exploded   class MineSweeper public Entity     For now, I only included Collisions, but I eventually want to extend it to  more types of Events too base class Event, Collision is derived class  void onCollisionPlayer p, Bomb b      if  bgtexploded          stdcout ltlt BOOM         bgtexploded  true        void onCollisionEntity e, Entity f      stdcout ltlt Unhandled collisionn    Possibility for Collision between Minesweeper and Bomb later   class Game  public     stdvectorltEntitygt board   some kind of linear board      Game          board  new Player, new Bomb, new MineSweeper           void mainloop          onCollisionboard[0], board[1]  player and bomb         onCollisionboard[1], board[2]         int main      Game g     g.mainloop  codepre  pNote that I understand perfectly well why the above code doesnt work as intended, I included this example solely to illustrate my problem better.p  pThe above example uses functions for the events, but Im perfectly fine with classes or any other solution that is maintainable.p  pI hope it is clear that I would like C to decide which event handler to use based on the types of the arguments presumably at runtime.p  pstrongMy question How can I do this in Cstrong An example would be appreciated.p  pemnotem my question fix my code pleasep

Negative 53249 pIm attempting to use a python script running on a Heroku app to copy data from a CSV file to a Postgres database the database is attached to said Heroku app. The problem I am encountering is that Heroku does not allow for superuser access to Postgres, and thus the strongCOPY FROM filenamestrong Postgres command cannot be run by my script. I have tried using strongCOPY FROM STDINstrong instead, to no avail. p  pIs there a problem with the code below Or perhaps another way I can achieve the task of copying from a CSV file to my Heroku Postgres database in my script Manually running psql commands in the terminal is not an option since the whole point is to automate the copy process to keep my database up to date without me touching it. p  precodecopysql is a string with the command for copying from the CSV file newvals is the name of a temporary table I will use for the data imported from the CSV file copysql  COPY newvals FROM STDIN FORMAT csv, NULL NULL sqlquery is the SQL string for inserting new data found in the temporary table which is created from the CSV import into the existing Postgres database sqlquery  INSERT INTO desttable SELECT newvals.id, newvals.column1, newvals.column2 FROM newvals LEFT OUTER JOIN desttable ON desttable.id  newvals.id WHERE desttable.id IS NULL  my CSV file is called csvfile and cur is the database cursor using psycopg2 and I have already connected to the db elsewhere in my script cur.executeDROP TABLE IF EXISTS newvals cur.executeCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE newvals AS SELECT  FROM desttable LIMIT 0 cur.copyexpertsqlcopysql,filecsvfile cur.executesqlquery codepre

Negative 53249 pMy CPU has four cores,MAC os. I use 4 threads to calculate an array. But the time of calculating doest being reduced. If I dont use multithread, the time  of calculating is about 52 seconds. But even I use 4 multithreads, or 2 threads, the time doesnt change.p  pI know why this happen now. The problem is that I use clock to calculate the time. It is wrong when it is used in multithread program because this function will multiple the real time based on the num of threads.

Negative 53249 pI need to make several detours to various functions and doing it one by one is just not an option. Im looking for a function that will take a table, ideally, and this table is class. Loop through it and for each key, value pair that is a function make a function pointer with a prefix before the original function name. I have tried several variations to achieve this effect, but they all yield different problems. Some simply will not make detour pointer no matter what you give to them, others make detour pointers but they dont work, and some will overflow the stack or simply not be recognized.p  pI want to know if there is a way, ie rawsets, metatable overrides, constant looping until they do match, etc to make it so the function can get a table or a string that has the same name as the table, thus a loadstring method would work here too and loop through each function and make a working detour pointer...no matter what.p  pI prefer using the selfprefixorigname... syntax [... can be replaced with actual args].p  pHeres 2 variations I have tried with example useage.p  precode 1st Method detours  detours or   function detourobject, class  Class is an extra arg that I would send if for some reason just sending an object didnt work...it was theory ohed     if detours[object] then  Check if the detour already exists...might be worth remaking it especially if the function gets overridden several times in different places         printdetour Previous  .. object ..  detour found, using previous detour         return     end     for name, func in pairsclass and class or loadstringreturn  .. object do          the loadstring method here is used because the argument received is a string of the same name as the table...thus loading it will yield a table         if typefunc  function then             local execute, error  loadstringobject .. .customdetour .. name ..    .. object .. . .. name  This makes the actual pointer             if error then                 printdetour Error  ..

Negative 53249 pI know little about JavaScript but, as with everything I do, Im throwing myself headfirst into some complex code at least emIem think its complex. The code is basically designed to fit as many approx. 300x200 images into a div called supercontainer.

The images will be resized slightly to make them fit in more aesthetically and nr of rows and columns are calculated also. Im not so concerned about how the logic of calculating number, or size, or position of images or boxes works, because I think this is sound.
