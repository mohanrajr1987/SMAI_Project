Or, is it that there is no relationship between the TortoiseSVN client and SVN server versions at all In which case too, compatibility matrix would certainly help.p  pApparently, there are major changes in SVN server version 1.5 and 1.8.

Positive 656 pThis is not a duplicate question. When using tortoise svnsubversion the file system reports that files have changed and upon reviewing the only thing that may have changed will be a tab or a space. There is lots of documentation on using alternative merge tools such as winmerge but altering the actual diff engine. This isnt as much of an issue with cjava as they have inbuilt formatters but without the use of redgate for SQL server this is a nightmare. My new client wants to enforce a standard of never using tabs over spaces. I could write something but it is fraught with complexities.p

Positive 656 pI have a couple of libraries that are built for Linux and windows. The Linux version builds via a codeMakefilecode in the root directory, and the Windows version is a Visual Studio 2010 project that uses the exact same source files. Platformspecific code is handled in a hardware abstraction layer header code.hcode file which handles things like codestrtokscode versus codestrtokrcode, Visual Studios C89 limitations, etc.p  pIn order to reduce the headache my devs have when dealing with SVN, I ran a batch script on a Linux box to convert the line endings for all the source code.ccode, code.hcode, and code.cppcode files to Linux codeLFcode, set the svn property for line endings to native ie codesvn propset eolstylenativecode, and commited all the files in one large commit.p  pNo issues on the Linux side of things, but whenever the Windows users check out the file they are using TortoiseSVN, make changes, and generate the diffpatch, TortoiseSVN complains about inconsistent line endings. I verified with GVim on Windows, and it seems the files all have UNIX style codeLFcode line endings, but the portions of the file that was changed in Visual Studio has Windows style codeCRLFcode line endings. p  pIn Visual Studio, Ive already manually saved the files as Unix Line Ending via the Advanced Save Options dialog, but this setting doesnt appear to persist after SVN commits, which leads me to suspect that no actual file options are saved in the Visual Studio project file code.vcprojcode or solution file code.slncode, but the encoding of the source file itself is just changed, and isnt preserved on our SVN server.p  pHow can I just setandforget line endings for crossplatform projects like this, or get Visual Studio to stop messing up the files It was to my understanding that setting the EOLstyle to native meant that clients check out files in the systems native encoding, and its stored in a preferred format on the SVN server, so I wouldnt have to deal with these issue.p  pThank you.p

Negative 656 pWe have a freezer plugged into a GFCI electrical outlet that likes to pop and turn off on its own every once in a great while.p  pWhat I would like to do is monitor the availability of this electrical outlet. Ideally, Id like to plug in a cheap monitoring device, like a Smarthome or X10 type of device  And when the circuit turns off, the device would trigger some script on an another computer that can send me an email or whatever.p  pI was unable to find anything like this from Smarthome and X10 devices.p  pI am aware that some UPS Uninterruptible Power Supply devices will send some kind of a signal when the power goes out. I think this may be what I need. Do I need to use a RS232 cable Would I need to configure a cheap linux server to do this  Or is there a way one of these devices can send a trigger over ethernet And can it be done without too much expensep  pTo summarize I want an inexpensive solution for something to send me an email when the electrical outlet goes dead.p

Negative 656 pI have a database class which is constructed so that it opens a connection to the database when the first query is run. Should each of the other classes, used for the sites users, groups and so on, create one database object each This makes the classes easy to deploy elsewhere they will only depend on the database class. This will however need me to put the credentials in each class. Another approach which seems less messy for me is create a database object and keep it in a global variable. This reduces the active database connections at the same time as it makes it easier to config the credentials only have to be set once.p  pSomewhere Ive heard that global variables should be avoided.

Negative 656 pI am working on a program that uses Nhibernate to persist objects, and Xml Serialization to import and export data. I cant use the same properties for collections as, for example, Nhibernate needs them to be Ilists, because it has its own implementation of that interface, and I cant Serialize interfaces. But as I need both properties to be synchronized, I thought I could use two different properties for the same Field.

The debugger says that after the Deserialization, the field is not updated null and the Property is empty Count  0.p  pThe obvious solution would be using two unrelated properties, one for each framework, and passing the information manually when needed.

Is this not possible without building a custom model binder  If anyone has a working example, I would greatly appreciate it.  For some reason, I am able to iterate through the child collection and successfully execute TryUpdateModel on the child objects, but when I call it on the parent, the error above is thrown.

I know that most things can be achieved with the STL algorithms or clever template metaprogramming. p  pBut still, for some use cases for example, in an API, if I do not want to be specific about the type of container I get, just about the elements it contains, an interface of the following form would be nicep  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt struct forwarditerable      struct iterator          typedef T  valuetype         typedef Tamp reference         typedef T pointer         virtual reference operator const  0         virtual pointer operatorgt const  0         virtual bool operatorconst iteratoramp const  0         virtual bool operatorconst iteratoramp const  0         virtual operator constiterator const  0         virtual iteratoramp operator  0         virtual iterator  operatorint  0          struct constiterator  ...    similar, but with const references      virtual iterator begin  0     virtual constiterator begin const  0     virtual iterator end  0     virtual constiterator end const  0  codepre  pIf the STL containers implement this class as nonvirtual function, this would, in my opinion, not affect performance if I use the containers directly and not via this interface.

Negative 656 pFirst some background Im using a UIScrollView to make an image visible and zoomable and everything works fine initially, I can view and zoom the image just fine. Im using a UINavigationController to manage all of my various custom view controllers. After the image is displayed, and the back button is clicked, this view controller is popped off the stack, and the previous one appears as expected. At this point, the problem arises. This view controller allows for some image manipulation and saves over the old image, but when I try to redisplay the image in the UIScrollView, it displays the old image and not the newer one, even if its stored correctly on disc. p  pI cant figure out how to get it to reload the image. When back is pressed, I release the UIScrollView and the UIImageView it uses and set both to nil. Its somehow still cached I guess.

Negative 656 pIm writing a graphical URI handler for git links with bash and zenity, and Im using a zenity textinfo dialog to show gits clone output while its running, using FIFO piping.

My aim is to force blocking for the read, and have zenitys text info dialog show all output progressively.delp  pcodegitcode outputs progress messages anything other than the Initialized message on stderr, but the moment I try to pipe stderr to a file or to merge with stdout, the messages disappear.p  pstrongFix attempt 1strongp  pIve tried to write two blocking versions of cats functions in C, bread and bwrite, like thisp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt mainint argc, char argv      int c     for           freopenargv[1], r, stdin         while c  getchar  EOF             putcharc        include ltstdio.hgt mainint argc, char argv      int c     for           freopenargv[1], w, stdout         while c  getchar  EOF             putcharc, fputswriting, stderr       codepre  pThey work nicely because they block and dont quit on EOF, but it hasnt quite solved the problem yet. At the moment, using one, the other, or both, works in theory, but in practice, zenity shows nothing at all now.p  pstrongFix attempt 2strongp  pmvds suggested that using a regular file, in combination with codetail fcode rather than codecatcode, may do this. Surprised at such a simple solution thanks I tried it but unfortunately, only the first line showed up in zenity and nothing else.p  pstrongFix attempt 3strongp  pAfter doing some straceing and inspecting gits source code, I realise that git outputs all its progress information anything past the Initialized message on stderr, and the fact that this is the first line and my assumption that its because of cat quitting early on EOF was a coincidencemisguided assumption git doesnt EOF until the program ends.p  pThe situation seemed to become a lot simpler, as I shouldnt have to change anything from the original code at the start of the question and it should work.

Negative 656 pI am not sure if this is solveable, but I though I will ask anyway.p  pIn my company we deal with massive enrollment camps where small teams of 5 to 10 people go to a village and enroll people. The enrollment involves entering some data, capturing fingerprints and taking a mugshot of the enduser using a webcam. Understandably enrollment is done by external vendors to whom we have outsourced the activity.p  pSince the no of records are overwhelmingly large trying to verify records manually is making the entire process slow. So we have automated as many things as possible except for one thing, which is to check if the photo captured using the webcam is of good quality.p  pI know, Good Quality is a vague term which cannot be translated to a software based solution. However, while trying to define Good Quality to myself, I found this a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiImagequality relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiImagequalityap  pNow, finally coming to my question, what parts of these image quality checks can be automated.p  pNote The photographs will be printed on a smartcard in stampsize. They would barely be 100x125 pixels at 300 DPI.p  pCheers, Raghup

Negative 656 pOK so I have read a whole bunch of articles suggesting tablevalue functions and cross apply give better performance than a scalar udf.

Negative 656 pOk,first post..p  pSo I have this assignment to decrypt cryptograms by hand,but I also wanted to automate the process a little if not all at least a few parts,so i browsed around and found some sed and awk one liners to do some things I wanted done,but not all i wantedneeded.p  pThere are some websites that sort of do what I want, but I really want to just do it in bash for some reason,just because I want to understand it better and such p  pThe script would take a filename as parameter and output another file such as codesolution1code when done.p  precodeif [ e PWD1 ] then  echo 1 exists else   echo 1 doesnt exists    fi codepre  pWould start the script to see if the file in param exists..p  pThen I found this one linerp  precodesed e s.0ng 1  while read cdo echo n c   done codepre  pWhich works fine but I would need to have the number of occurences per letter, I really dont see how to do that.p  pHere is what Im trying to achieve more or less a hrefhttp25yearsofprogramming.comfunciphers.htm relnofollowhttp25yearsofprogramming.comfunciphers.htma for the counting unique letter occurences and such.p  pI then need to put all letters in lowercase.p  pAfter this I see the script doing theses things.. a subscript that scans a dictionary file for certain pattern and size of words the bigger words the better. For example lets say the solution is the word apparel and the crypted word is zxxzgvk is there a regex way to express the pattern that compares those two words and lists the word apparel in a dictionnary file because appa and zxxz are similar patterns and zxxzgvk is of similar length with apparel p  ol lipCan this be part done and is it realistic to view the problem like this or is this just far fetched p  ul liAnother subscript who takes the found letters from the previous output word and that swap letters in the cryptogram.li ulli ol  pThe swapped letters will be in uppercase to differentiate them over time.p  pIll have to figure out then how to proceed to maybe rescan the new found words to see if theyre found in a dictionnary file partly or fully as well,then swap more letters or not.p  ol lipDid anyone see this problem in the past and tried to solve it with the patterns in words like i described it,or is this just too complex pli lipShould I log any of the swaps pli ol  pMaybe just scan through all the crypted words and swap as I go along then do another sweep with having for constraint in the first sweep to not change uppercase lettersactually to use them as more precise patterns..p  pAnyone did some similar scriptprogram in another langage If so which one Maybe I can relate somehow p  pMaybe we can use your insight as to how you thought out your code.p  pI will happily include the cryptograms I have decoded and the one I have yet to decode p  pAgain, the focus of my assignment is not to do this script but just to resolve the cryptograms. But doing scripts or at least trying to see how I would do this script does help me understand a little more how to think in terms of code. Feel free to point me in the right directionsp  pThe cryptogram itself is based on simple alphabetic substitution.p  pI have done a pastebin here with the code to be   a hrefhttppastebin.comUEQDsbPk relnofollowhttppastebin.comUEQDsbPkap  pIn pseudocode the way I see it is p  ul licall program with an input filename in param and optionally a second filenamedictionary  li liverify the input file exists and isnt empty  li liread the files content and echo it on screen  li litransform to lowercase  li liscan through the text and count the amount of each letter to do a frequency analysis  li liask the user what langage is the text supposed to be english default  li liuse the response to specify which letter frequencies to use as a baseline  li liswap letters corresponding to the frequency analysis in uppercase..  li liprint the changed document on screen  li liask the user to swap letters in the crypted textli liif user had given a dictionary file as the second argument  li lithen scan the cipher for words and find the bigger words  li lifind words with a similar pattern some letters repeating letters in the dictionary fileli lilist on screen the results if any  li lioffer to swap the letters corresponding in the cipher   li liprint modified cipher on screen  li liask again to swap letters or find more similar words  li ul  pMore or less it the way I see the script structured.p  ol liDo you see anything that I should add,did i miss somethingli ol  pI hope this revised version is more clear for everyonep

Negative 656 pI know this is really basic stuff but i need to understand whether my understanding of this is correct.p  pSo what i want to do is this.

Both views will be of same size as an codeUIPickerViewcode which is 320px x 216px.p  pWhat i am thinking of to do is create two codeUIViewcodeclasses named labelView and pickerView. I would then create a codeviewControllercode which on codeloadViewcode loads codelabelViewcode then when user double taps the codelabelViewcode i get an event in codelabelViewcode class which is sent to my codeviewControllercode that then can unload codeloadViewcode and load the codepickerViewcode.p  pDoes this sound as the best way to do this  Is there a simpler way  I am also unsure how i route the event from the codelabelViewcode class to the codeviewControllercodeclass.p

Negative 656 pIm trying to figure out the best way to populated the staging database in a data warehouse.  I will have a number of databases identical schema, SQL Server 2005 Standard.

Data in the publisher databases will be modified.  The subscriber database will only be updated by its subscriptions, and therefore does not need to send changes back to any of the publishers.  Publisher databases dont need to update each other.

Negative 656 pI know that normally there are no problems using Git from different OSs to work with the same repositories, but I want to know if this particular scenario would be an exception to that. Do you see any problems working this wayp  pWe have an Ubuntu server with several Git repositories on it. Git is installed on the server and sometimes people will SSH in to gain remote access and use Git that is installed on that server directly through the shell yes I know that is weird and the standard would be to have a local cloned Git repository instead of using the remote Git installation.p  pOn my Windows 7 workstation I am using WebDrive to map a directory from the Ubuntu server as a network drive on my computer even though my computer is on a completely different network. This works over SSH. I want to use the git installation on my Windows 7 computer to work with the files on this drive as if they were local. I will be doing things like cloning from, pulling from, and pushing to repositories that were created and continue to be used by the Git installation from the Ubuntu server.p  pI cant see any reason that this would create any problems that you would not normally run into with the standard use of Git, but I just wanted to make sure I dont want to have a corrupt repository. Also, is there anything I should watch out for when working this wayp  pEDIT My requirements just now changed. I will also need to do direct commits in addition to pulls and pushes using my msysgit to a repository that was created with the Ubuntu git.p

Negative 656 pTwo related applications use a function in a package in several queries to return some data as CSV. The column being selected and concatenated is a CLOB field and can contain HTML, special characters, etc. The applications have few users and so are not heavily used. One is a Flex application that consumes Oracle HTTP services, and the other is an ASP.NET application that uses ODP.NET. The applications are really one integrated application with hyperlinks to each other.p  pYesterday, I received several notifications of a strange error  p  blockquote   pORA01031 insufficient privileges ORA06512p blockquote  pThe line number in the package in the error details indicates that the error was caused by the function being used in the select clause. It would occur when called by either application about 75 of the time.p  pAm I correct that an codeORA06512code occurred in the function that then caused an codeORA01031 insufficient privilege errorcode Unfortunately, codeORA06512code is a very generic error and doesnt tell me anything. And why would it cause an invalid privilege error The Oracle user accounts being used by both applications have the execute privilege on the package that contains the function.p  pRegarding the function... it has been used for about 2 years in production without any issue. Also, when I imported the data to QA yesterday and tested it, no error would occur, no matter how many times I hammered the server with requests. But in production, the error would occur about 75 of the time with exactly the same parameters.p  pThe DBA tried to help me with a trace, but we could not find the error message in the trace files.p  pToday, everything is back to normal in production. Even if I hammer the server with requests the error will stubbornly refuse to occur.p  pWhat caused this very strange behaviour yesterday Do any of the gurus here have any ideasp  pEDIT I just realized one important detail. The column in the table that is being selected and concatenated into CSV by the function is a CLOB.p

Negative 656 pHeres an interesting question to me at least Is it possible to intercept arbitrary property accessors getterssetters in an object, such that I can reroute that request elsewhere, such as to a private member objectp  pId love it if I could make it appear as though my outer object automatically has access to certain inner properties i.e. everything except for a few exceptions of an inner object that the caller doesnt know about, in effect making the outer shell object behave like the inner object, without having to manually create properties that map to each of the inner objects properties.p  pTheres probably a pattern for that, but my guess is it involves manually wiring the outer properties to the inner properties.p

Negative 656 pthis is my first question, but Ive readed StackOverflow for years. Well the thing is that I must concatenate a set of videos MP4 in a particular order, and the last one must loop continuously. Okay, lets try codeAVFoundationcode.p  pIve defined all the elements such as codeAVCompositioncode, codeAVURLAssetcode and codeAVPlayerItemcode. Then I build the codeAVPlayercode and the codeAVPlayerLayercode. Everything is okay and the videos are played in the correct order but... and here comes the problemp  pI can note a tiny flick when the AVPlayer passes from one video to the next one. I can ignore that one, but when codeAVPlayercode reaches codeAVPlayerItemcodes end, and the selector is called for codeAVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTimeNotificationcode, I use seekToTime to move the reading head to the correct and then play it again. Works fine, but a GREAT flick is repeated when using seekToTime and playing again. I cannot allow that.p  pDoes anybody know how to repeat the last asset on AVPlayerItem continuously and without flicksp  pThank you all.p

Negative 656 pthis is my first question here on SO although Ive been lurking for quite a while. Im wondering what the best way is to search through around 350,000 records in a product database. Im rewriting an application that currently searches something like this As soon as you click Enter on the search textbox, the DB is queried and displays 10 records. Then as you navigate through the records with the up and down arrows within the ListView control, it will query for the next 10 records depending on the direction your going. Looking at other questions, I couldnt find any that specifically addressed doing this with the ListView in VS2010. Ive done a little research on the Virtual Mode of the ListView, but figured since its only displaying 10 records at a time, the normal ListView would be fine. Im currently able to display 10 records, but am getting stuck trying to figure out how to keep track of and query for one more record.p  pHas anyone had any experience with this or possibly have some advice Thanksp

Negative 656 h2Overviewh2  pI am using urlopen from the Python 2.7.1 urllib2 package to do a HTTP POST form a Windows XP machine to a remote Apache webserver for instance the builtin web sharing of Mac OS X. The sent data contains some identifier, data and a checksum, if all data is sent the server responds with an acknowledgement. The checksum in the data can be used to check if everything arrived in fine order.p  h2The Problemh2  pUsually this works great, however sometimes the internet connection is bad, often because the client sending the data uses a wifi or 3G connection. This results in internet connection loss for some arbitrary amount time. urlopen contains a timeout option, to make sure that this does not block your program and it can continue.p  pThis is what I want, but the problem is that urlopen does not stop the socket from continuing to send whatever data it still had to send when the timeout occurred. I have tested this with the code that I will show below by trying to send a large bit of data to my laptop, I would see the network activity on both show activity, Id then stop the wireless on the laptop, wait until the function times out, and then reactivate the wireless, and the data transfer would then continue, but the program will not be listening for responses anymore. I even tried to exit the Python interpreter and it would still send data, so control of that is handed over to Windows somehow.p  h2Causesh2  pThe timeout as I understand it works like this It checks for an idle response timebr  a hrefhttpmail.python.orgpipermailpythondev2007March071659.html[PythonDev] Adding socket timeout to urllib2a br If you set the timeout to 3, it will open the connection, start a counter, then try to send the data and wait for a response, if at any point before receiving the response the timer runs out a timeout exception is called. Note that the sending of the data does not seem to count as activity a far as the timeout timer is concerned.br  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2137335urllib2timesoutbutdoesntclosesocketconnectionurllib2 times out but doesn39t close socket connectiona br  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5442291closeurllib2connectionClose urllib2 connectiona p  pApparently it is somewhere stated that when a socket is closeddereferencedgarbage collected it calls its close function which waits for all data to be sent before closing the socket. However there is also a shutdown function, which should stop the socket immediately, preventing any more data to be sent.br  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions409783socketshutdownvssocketclosesocket.shutdown vs socket.closea br  a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarysocket.htmlsocket.socket.closehttpdocs.python.orglibrarysocket.htmlsocket.socket.closea p  h2What I Wanth2  pI want the connection to be shutdown when a timeout occurs. Otherwise my client will not be able to tell if the data was received properly or not and it might try to send it again. Id rather just kill the connection and try again later, knowing that the data was probably not send successfully the server can recognize this if the checksum does not match.p  pHere is part of the code that I used to test this. The try..except parts do not yet work as Id expect, any help there is also appreciated. As I said before I want the program to shutdown the socket as soon as the timeout or any other exception is raised.p  precodefrom urllib import urlencode from urllib2 import urlopen, HTTPError, URLError import socket import sys  class Uploader     def initself         self.URL  http...         self.data  urlencodefakerangerange0,2000000,1         print Data Generated      def uploadself         try             f  urlopenself.URL, self.data, timeout10             returncode  f.read         except URLError, HTTPError, msg             returncode  strmsg         except socket.error             returncode  Socket Timeout         else             returncode  Im here  def main     upobj  Uploader     returncode  upobj.upload      if returncode  100         print Success     else         print Maybe a Fail         print returncode     print The End  if name  main main codepre

Negative 656 pLet me preface this problem with the following strongemIve only tested this using the storage emulator.emstrong SDK 1.5.p  pUsing a quickly built console app and local storage emulator, I created a fail scenario to test how a blob lease behaves upon the application exiting ungracefully. In the Azure production version, it would be in the form of multiple web role instances accessing the single blob and locking it via leases. Ive had web role instances fail out, so I figured this would be a good test scenario.p  pThe app acquires the lease on a particular blob, hits a break point before the lease release and I manually kill the console app. When I rerun the console app and try to acquire a new lease, I get the conflict error 409. This behavior is even exhibited quite some time after the first lease acquisition and ungraceful exit.p  pI know, I know... I should just push it out to the cloud and see what happens, but I havent had the opportunity yet.p  pIs this behavior simply a case of the wacky storage emulator or will Azure behave the same wayp

Negative 656 pI have a couple of node types, policy, quote, customer etc and each of those has a set of actions called that are printed in a menu of links which are coded into the template file.

My question is not a how do I make my code work kind of question, thats already been done. My question is about why the compiler thinks its necessary. For a purely virtual class, shouldnt I be allowed to write something likep  precodeclass DerivedClass  BaseClass   public   DerivedClass  varSOMEVALUE   codepre  pIf the compiler knows that a call to a BaseClass constructor will necessarily be followed by a call to some derived class constructror since an object of abstract type can never be instantiated shouldnt it give us a bit more leewayp  pIs this all a consequence of how C chooses to get around the Diamond problem Even if that was the case, shouldnt the compiler at least somehow allow for the possibility that const member variable of purely virtual functions will be defined in derived classes Is that too complicated or does that mess with the C solution to the Diamond problemp  pThanks for the help everyone.p

Negative 656 pThis is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8106034changesindataandtheireffectonhistoricaldatathis questionap  pBasically I am writing the database and software for a building monitoring system.  The system monitors things like temperature, humidity, pressure of units such as fridges.p  pWhen a report is generated for a particular unit, it has a column for each sensor with the sensor name, with the readings below.p  pIm trying to decide whether it should be the names at the time of the reading, or the name as it stands now.p  pI currently think it should be the latter, because I tend to believe that given the same primary key, the strongmeaningstrong of the data it uniquely identifies should not change even if its attributes do.  So, any name changes should be for correction or clarification only, IMO, almost as if the name itself was the primary key Im all for natural keys but tend not to use the name of something due to length and possible need for spelling correction  in this case though I have a SensorNo field not ID which is unique to the unit it is monitoring.p  pAnyway  this means I can indeed use the current name, and if they change the name of the sensor from perhaps Air to Food, then it should say Food on all report data even if it is showing data from before the change, the idea being this change should mean it was always meant to be Food, not Air  it is a correction.p  pFor none key data such as Upper Limit and Lower Limit the temperature range for instance the stronghistoricalstrong data should be used when reporting, in this case because it shows the temperature range of the sensor at the time of the reading.p  pYou could argue it is similar to changing the fullname of a user it is still the same person, but they may of changed their name, therefore the report history should always show the persons up to date name, otherwise confusion could ensue.p  pMy plan is to allow users to change the name but warn them of the implications first, and state it should only be used for corrections.p  pWhat are peoples thoughts on this  How do you handle this situation  Im interested too in hearing from strongCatcallstrong who anwered the question linked.p  pPlease note this is not a discussion about how historical data is stored, Im already fine with that side of things.p

Negative 656 pIve got an app that uses codeListActivitycode to give users a list of actions.

I tried using codesetContentViewR.layout.loadingcode on codeonPreExecutecode, but it throws a NullPointerException which as far as I have figured out is due to the fact that codeloading.xmlcode is not a ListView whose ID is codeandroid.R.id.listcode.p  pSo what can I do now How can I show that loading screen Is there a way around this pretty annoying situation Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 656 pId like to create a Silverlight 4 or 5 application that can bulkbatch download files from the hosting web server. On the client, the user will be presented with a list of files from which they select one or more of them to download. From that point, Im trying to figure out how this will work. I would like to strongavoidstrong prompting the user multiple times e.g. once for each file. There should be just a single save as prompt, and from there, the download should execute.p  pHere are my initial thoughtsp  pstrong1 Save File in Clientstrongp  pIf there was a way the user could select a drop folder where the files would be downloaded, writing them to disk might not be too difficult. However, Im not aware of any way to do this in Silverlight. Isolated Storage was the first thing that popped into my mind, but it wont be easy for the user to get to that location once the files have been written... As far as I know, theres just the SaveFileDialog, and I certainly dont want to prompt the user for the location and name of each file.p  pstrong2 Download File from Serverstrongp  pIf we could somehow utilize the browsers built in saveopen download capabilities, this would be an easy option. Ive found a few basic articles demonstrating how to do this, but I think our scenario becomes complicated because there are multiple files and the files that the user selects to download in a batch is dynamic. In my mind, I guess Im thinking of creating some type of on the fly ziparchive containing the files the user selects to download and then downloading the zip as a single file. p  pAny thoughts or suggestions on how something like this could be implemented Im sure its possible, but its just new territory for me.p  pThanksp

Negative 656 pI am a happy Emacs user on Mac OS X for almost a year now. The problem is that I experience almost random crashes of Emacs several times. My setup isp  pGNU Emacs 24.0.95.1 x8664appledarwin, NS appleappkit1038.36 [installed as Emacspretest24.0.95universal10.6.8 from a hrefhttpemacsformacosx.combuildshttpemacsformacosx.combuildsa ] on Mac OS X 10.7.3. The reason for Emacs 24 is because of the latest features in Gnus.p  pThe main problem is of course that I cant track down the reasons why Emacs crashes. Sometimes it crashes when I capture a new event in orgmode, today it crashed when I added an attachment to an open email in Gnus per draganddrop  both tasks I frequently do without problems. The only hint I found is a hrefhttpwww.quora.comHowcanIfindthecauseofanEmacscrashonOSXhttpwww.quora.comHowcanIfindthecauseofanEmacscrashonOSXa so it seems I am not alone.p  pAssume Emacs crashed and I reopened it. If I doubleclick a file in Finder to be opened in Emacs, the file doesnt open. I rather get a buffer showing a file I loaded at some previous point in time. If I doubleclick the file in Finder again, it is then opened. I have to do this for every new file I would like to open. The simple solution is that after a crash I open Emacs, close it normally, and open it again. It then runs fine  until the next crash p  pI know this is far too vague to be useful to ask , but I would like to know if this is a problem specific to my setup, specific to the Mac, or Emacs 24. So if anyone experiences similar crashes, it would be good to know. Two linux guys told me that they experience crashes about once a month, so I guess there is room for improvement  p

When mousemove event is triggered, if it moves up and down which is global dragging, Ill make this variable codetruecode. And it will be set codefalsecode when mouseup event is triggered. For local dragging, every time it detects a mousemove event, it will first check this variable to see if it is codetruecode and it will only work when this variable is false. p  pBut it seems that my method didnt work as expected. I found that every time mousemove event is triggered, it will be catched by both global dragging and local dragging callback function immediately. So under this circumstance, the local dragging callback function has already get started before I set this variable in global dragging callback funnction. It didnt work in this way.p  pSo I want to know if someone could provide me with a more solid and reasonable method to solve this Thanks a lot in advance.p

Negative 656 pAt my company, we have been running into some memory problems lately.  One thing we have done is increased the heap size in JRUN, but now we are noticing some side effects.p  pOne of which is a CFX tag that processes images. When we use it, it cannot load the files we give it sometimes. Our current idea is that in order to process images, the whole image must be loaded into memory.  It only seems to throw errors on large files, which would take 200 MB of memory to store the whole thing.p  pWhat I am wanting to know is how Coldfusion handles CFX tag loading and execution.  Since the CFX tag in particular was written in C, I would think that it wouldnt necessarily use the Coldfusion heap as it only stores Java data, and we are not seeing heap spikes when we process something.p  pI guess the major question is how the CFX gets executed does it run as a thread under JRUN, or does a native Windows process get created that runs in its own user space  And, if it does run under JRUN, what memory space does this use when executing, and is there a way to monitor itp

The first time I fork, Id get the child pid and save it as a process group id. Each child that Id create, Id set its group to this pid. Do you guys think thats a good choice Im having trouble with that.p  pMy second idea would be to reset the signal handler to the original one or just call it. If I reraise the signal, the original handler would be able to get it. Id have to reinstall my signal handler after that. Would it be a good choicep  pMy third choice would be using INFO extended signal handler. I believe the pid of the dying process will be available in the info structure. If this is one of mine children, Id call waitpid for that and thats ok. If that is not one of mine, Id call the original signal handler. Would it be a good choicep  pJust one last side question. To be able to call original signal handlers, should I always restore them and reraise the signal or just calling that as a function call is enoughp  pThanks very much for your help.p

Negative 656 pMy company is cursed by a symbiotic partnership turned parasitic.  To get our data from the parasite, we have to use a painfully slow odbc connection.  I did notice recently though that I can get more throughput by running queries in parallel even on the same table.p  pThere is a particularly large table that I want to extract data from and move it into our local table.  Running queries in parallel I can get data faster, but I also imagine that this could cause issues with trying to write data from multiple queries into the same table at once.p  pWhat advice can you give me on how to best handle this situation so that I can take advantage of the increased speed of using queries in parallelp  pEDIT  Ive gotten some great feedback here, but I think I wasnt completely clear on the fact that Im pulling data via a linked server which uses the odbc drivers.  In other words that means I can run normal INSERT statements and I believe that would provide better performance than either SqlBulkCopy or BULK INSERT actually, I dont believe BULK INSERT would even be an option.p

I need to pick the records from the table where Sum of Volume is equal to THRESHOLD1 and then the same for Threshold2. p  pOne way is to add a new Column to the table which has the sum of Volume for the previous records. for example p  pID  CreationDateTime  Volume  SUMp  p1   20072012         10     10p  p2   21072012         12     22p  p3   22072012         7      29p  pand then Select  from temp where Sum  Threshold But the calculation of the sum is not the fastest way.p  pI was wondering if anyone can suggest a better way for doing the above.p  pIm using SQL server 2008 and I can also use CLR if required.p

Negative 656 pI have what I think is a simple project in which I am using Spring to manage JPA and and EclipseLink for my persistence unit. Im using JavaFX for my frontend and I have split my project into the client module, common module and server module.  Im using Maven for my builds.  I have been banging my head against a wall for a few days now trying to figure this out.  I have tried different configurations of persistence units and servlet configurations and nothing seems to work.  And the errors always seem to be very similar something in the transaction manager configuration or usage is suspect.p  pAll help is greatly appreciated.  Im new to this Spring JPA space, so excuse me if the problem isnt defined adequately.p  pHere is my pomp  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance      xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgxsdmaven4.0.0.xsdgt ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt  ltgroupIdgtcom.lamtecltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtNewTrialServerltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt ltpackaginggtwarltpackaginggt  ltnamegtNewTrialServerltnamegt lt Spring Web MVC gt ltbuildgt     ltpluginsgt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavencompilerpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.3.2ltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltsourcegt1.7ltsourcegt                 lttargetgt1.7lttargetgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt     ltpluginsgt ltbuildgt ltrepositoriesgt     ltrepositorygt         ltidgtunknownjarstemprepoltidgt         ltnamegtA temporary repository created by NetBeans for libraries and jars it could not identify.

Negative 656 pI have a custom widget derived from a GtkVBox which depending on state contains a selection of subwidgets. I want all instances of this custom widget to be of the same height and subwidgets to always be placed at the same position inside this custom widget even if some subwidgets are not visible, i.e. if not all subwidgets are shown I want the space where subwidgets would be shown to be taken up and empty.p  pE.g. consider a GtkVBox which may contain up to four buttons, but sometimes only shows the first and the last button. There should be empty vertical space between the first and last button which corresponds to the space the second and third button would take if they were shown, i.e. with placholders of equivalent size in between.p  pAs far as I understand it I have two optionsp  ol lieither I could use a GtkFixed as a container and do all positioning and sizing code myselfli lior I could create fake buttons, get a size requisition from it, and then add a dummy widget, e.g. an empty GtkLayout of equivalent size as a placeolder to the VBoxli ol  pThe second option is rather hackish but saves me from writing quite a bit of code, are there any downsides to it How would you do it and why, any better ideasp

Negative 656 pI have a InvZone class in flash that extends sprite.  The idea is that this class  will create an array of Sprite children, compute and assign x,y,width and height properties to them and then addChild them in rows how many rows and children being specified in the arguments.p  pBoth the sprite invZone and its children invWindow are in the Flash library.  There they have symbols added to provide backgrounds and make sure their initial starting dimension are not 0.p  pMy problem is  the act of adding the children seems to be throwing out the height and width values of the InvZone instance.

Height is not the only value affected  the containing width can be blown out with different variables.  When this occurs, all the InvWindow sprites change size consistently but not the original background symbol from the library.  Ive tried shifting declarations and adding ADDEDTOSTAGE listeners, but there is no change. Can someone hit me with a clue stick, pleasep  pUPDATE To clarify I dont think the childrens edges should exceed the boundaries of the containing sprite  and so AFAIK it shouldnt expand at all. Sanchez has fixed the symptom, but whats the cause of the containing InvZone expanding and stretching the InvWindowsp  pstrongUPDATE2 with solutionstrong Acting on Sanchezs suggestion below to look to see what might be scaling  I realised the background sprite added to invZone in the library to give it a dimension was scaling in unexpected ways, breaking the boundaries.  By adding the background sprite in code rather than in the library, giving it the arguments for the class for h amp w and letting it define invZones dimensions, the problem went away.p

Negative 656 pThis question focuses on finding a perfect solution for an asynchronous image resizing process guided by a cron job  job queue.p  pemImages are getting uploaded and saved in the original size on the server. The resize process picks them up, resizes and saves them in two new sizes. For this job I use Imagemagick with the following setup [nice n 19 convert density 500  . fullpath .  resample  . dpi .   . destFolder . d.jpg]. nice will not prevent a command from using 100 CPU. What it does do is say that if any other process needs CPU, it will get a higher priority than the nice processes. As you see this is just some improvement  because I am sure if users will upload pictures simulataneously the server will definitely crash.emp  pstrongMy intention is to process all images through the server and not locally via Flash or Java. So if I cant get more server CPU amp RAM, I think I need to implement an asynchronous resize job queue through a cron job which gets offered a limited CPU amp Memory usage. While an image is processed, the user gets a thumbnail with the info, your image will be soon available, to stop him from uploading the same image again. Thats my basic idea at the moment.strongp  pI work with a PHP framework on a Debian Linux server for this web application. Any help, guiding tips or information resources for such a cron jobjob queueimplementation ideas are highly appreciatedp  pMany thanks in advancep  pCheersp  pThommyp

If it is 2, the grid is a 2x2 grid. So all the grids are square.p  pThe BeginPosition and EndPosition are shown like this posX,Y.p  pThe function nextStep looks for a valid neigbor of a given position. The values of X and Y have to be between 1 and the grid size. Ive declared 4 different predicates of nextStep X  1, X  1, Y  1 and Y  1.

Negative 656 pI recently hit a problem with a SOAP web service where the WSDL specifies an integer for a particular field, but the XML comes in with an empty element which causes the .NET deserialization logic to throw a FormatException.p  pThe WSDL looks like thisp  precodeltxsdelement minOccurs0 maxOccurs1 nameTransID typexsdint gt codepre  pAnd the SOAP looks like thisp  precodeltTransIDgtltTransIDgt codepre  pThis causes the exception when parsing the response.  The server Im talking to belongs to a vendor so I dont have the option to change it.  Im hacking around this in the short term by redefining the field as a string.p  pMy question is this In trying to diagnose this problem, I pulled out the XML into a file and created my own XmlSerializer to test deserializing using the POCOs generated by the WSDL import.  The XmlSerializer I created parses this XML just fine and produces the parent type as expected.  No exception.  The field value is zero which would be expected.  Why does the SOAP deserializer puke and the plain deserializer I created works finep
Negative 656 pbr  br We have a school project with HTMLPHP, and we need to create a web page.

Negative 656 pIm developing an AR app for android and I need a really accurate position under 1m. The app is pedestrian based outdoors and needs the location in real time. Im aware that the problem is probably a really hard one, but hopefully others have come across a solution to this.p  pIve already looked into Kalman filters and extended Kalman filters, but so far I havent found a solution that I have been able to use or adapt. I think that a kalman filter is probably the direction I need to go.p  pRight now im using the raw gps data to set my location, but this is too inaccurate and can move around or even jump by about 510 meters when the device is standing still in one place.p  pSo my question is while I am using now the raw unfiltered gps data to get a position, how would I need to filter it kalman extended kalman and which sensors would i need to use gps position gps speed accelerometer to get the most possible accurate location pedestrian outdoor location.p  pUPDATE i need to update my question, since its not possible to do what my initial question was, getting a sub 1meter accuracy on tabletphone gps. my question now is how can i apply filtering so that subsequent gps position measurements stay within a manageable distance. e.g. so that when i go 10m north with my device that my gps also measures that i went 10m north 1m 10 from my initial position and not the jumpingmoving around that the gps measures.p

Negative 656 pMy main goal with the program in question is to generate a Google map that shows the location of a specific building. p  pDue to Google limitation reasons, I have generated and stored all latitudes and longitudes for all the buildings that I analyze in a MS SQL databaseit is a real estate web site. Everytime one building is selected then I retreive its corresponding latitud and longitude and store it in two aspLabels. I use a script in Javascript in order to process the latitud and longitud which are passed on via two aspLabels. My problem is that for some reason the LatLng function does not seem to work property and my maps do not show the coordinates that they should. I think I may have a problem with the type of variable that LatLng is expecting. I have tried both, default string that is passed on and converting the variables to real type. Here is the script.

Negative 656 pI have been advised to refrain usage of Reflection. I really wanted to know, is it because Reflection is emexpensiveem If not what is the reason to avoid using it p  pMy current and future projects might as well need to access any given class  members information. As I some times need to list fields amp  Properties  values or declaration name.p  pSo What I would like to know, isp  pstrongHow does Reflection work How does it get to the information a short explanation will dostrongp  pAnd why its not so recommended to use the reflection in application  If you do need to get required information being a field or properties values OR names, could you do it strongnotstrong by using System.Reflection p  pSome background.p  pThe usage in my current projectfor example, is to list out a specific sql server tablecolumns names, or SQL  tables names .p  pI could think of other ways to have it returned as a codeListltstringsgtcode.  p  pstrongIf I really knew why or how bad it isstrong,  to use codereflectioncode, p  p..I could then make a decision, if I really want to avoid it, as I might find an alternative approach in this specific scenario.p  pEither by accessing database not preferable any time I need say list of tables names or I could do it once access the data , then store it in a text file or xml, if I really must avoid reflection.p  pI know of some even more elegant one, too. Thats not the issue though. again this is only an example as there could be many other use cases, you probably know that. p  pupdatep  pthis Question was closed  please help reopen it , and vote reopen belowp  pthanks .p

Negative 656 pI am making a website where users are to like some articles.

This file takes article id and user id and updates the sql database and also adds a node in an xml file related to the user. This is the first time I am doing something for mass usage.p  pI am worried about the server load when too many users call the likeclicked.php file. Please help me, if this method is ok.p  pI am also thinking of an alternative in case the above method fails. I am thinking of making many likeclicked files namely likeclicked1.php, likeclicked2.php ...  to minimize load on a single inode. Is there a method to detect that it is better to call the next likeclicked file. Here we would need to detect how many calls per unit time are coming for the particular file.

Negative 656 pIm having a fairly complicated layout issue that only occurs on Webkit browsers. Have a look at this screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgObG5.jpg altenter image description herep  pFirst, allow me to explain what I am trying to do here. The purpose of this layout is to show a grid of images, with each grid cell being square. The layout is responsive, so on another viewport width, there may be 3 images per row instead of 2. p  pTechnically, the markup is a list of figures, and within each figure is a link, and within the link is the actual image. Pseudo markupp  precodeltulgt ltligtltfiguregtlta hrefgtltimg src width0 height0 gtltagtltfiguregtltligt ltligtltfiguregtlta hrefgtltimg src width0 height0 gtltagtltfiguregtltligt ltulgt codepre  pAs you can see, the innner image does not have any width. This is intentional, because the width is set on the li element, which I use as the image container. In the example viewport as seen in the screenshot, the width of the li element is set to 50.p  pNext, during runtime, I hide the img element alltogether and set its src path as background image on the a element. The purpose of this is to center the image correctly, regardless of the images dimensions or aspect ratio. p  pstrongMajor notestrong I am using boxsizingborderbox on all elements.p  pNow, during this runtime routine I also calculate the height of the li element dynamically in order to enforce it to be square. Let us assume for a moment that the example screenshot has a viewport width of 400 pixels. Since all li elements are set to have a width of 50, they should have a width of 200 pixels. Knowing this, I simply set the height of this li element to 200 pixels as well, making it a square containerp  precode applied to all lis in the list this.heightthis.width codepre  pThis works perfect in every browser I tested, except for Webkit browsers Chrome, Safari. When I output the width of the a or li element before setting it, both the width and the CSS width, nonwebkit browsers will report the exact same width for every a element. When I look at the console in webkit browsers, there are variations in their widths. One a element may be 200px whilst the other is 191px. The actual values and whether it occurs at all depends on the viewport width of the browser so it seems. p  pEither way, the result are the ugly gaps you see in the screenshot. What happened is that due to webkit unexpectedly reporting different width for these a containers although they are all set to 50, the height will also have varieties, causing the gaps.p  pThe big question therefore is why does webkit report incorrect and different widths for a elements that are all set to 50 of the same parent, whilst other browsers dontp  pstrongTheories so farstrongp  pHereby a few things investigated so farp  pI am using inlineblock on the li elements, which is known to cause additional space. I have solved this by removing the whitespace from the markup. Either way, inlineblock is not the issue, since when I change the li elements to float, webkit browsers still show different widths when they shouldnt.p  pAnother theory has to do with the order of loading things, where some claim delaying my image background runtime routine to the window.load event may help. Unfortunately, the result is exactly the same.p  pIm also aware of the difference between .width and .csswidth in jQuery Im using 1.8.2. It does not make a difference, since I output both on the console, and Webkit gets both values wrong. p  pstrongSummarizingstrongp  pSorry for the long explanation, hereby a summary I set a width of 50 or 33.3333, depending on the viewport width on list elements and then retrieve the actual pixel width during runtime. For some mysterious reason, webkit browsers report different widths, allthough all the list elements have the same percentage width.p  pFinally, here is a live link of the issuep  p[removed, due to issue solved and live code changed now]p  pTo reproduce the issue, you have to use a webkit browser and resize your window roughly to that of my example screenshot. It seems to happen at arbitrary viewport widths.p
Negative 656 pThe grid is loaded fine and resizing the columns also work fine with shrinkToFittrue and forceFittrue when the grid doesnt show the vertical scrollbar ie when not many rows are present in the grid.p  pBut when the grids object has more rows, vertical scroll bar appears in the grid. The grids header columns are not in sync with body columns and resizing also continues to be out of sync between the header amp body columns, even with shrinkToFittrue and forceFittrue.p  pFrom my understanding, I think the scrollbars width is also taken into account as btables width when the scroll bar shows which causes the outofsync problem.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9H5IS.png relnofollowScreenshotap  pAny ideas p

Negative 656 pwe are trying to find a good solution for creating a singleton on weblogic. p  pRight now we have an ear that is deployed both in a clustered environment and single server. Within the ear is a singleton that holds some state. Duplicating that state over 2 servers would lead to incorrect behavior. Currently that singleton is only accessed though an MDB that is deployed as max 1. That MDB is listening to a topic. The topic is not distributed which leads to us having it on only one server, but resulting in warnings on the deployment which we dont like.p  pWeve considered a couple of solutions p  ul liWeblogics SingletonService. Works ok, but it works on clusters only leading to issues for single server versions of the application and for developer sandboxes.li liCreating a separate ear for the singleton and surrounding code and deploying it on a separate managed server. That is expected to work as required, but will require a substantial amount of work to decouple our singleton from surrounding code and require us to expose a lot of functionality to remote access.li liMaking singleton stateless removing the singleton requirement. Should work, but again, would require a lot of workli ul  pAre there other ways to resolve the issue Maybe some JMS trickp

Negative 656 pI have to acquire a signal from an external device and simultaneously display a visual stimuli an LCD screen.p  pThe signal is sampled by a BCI device at 512 Hz and it is sent to PC with a Bluetooth connection. While I acquire this signal I have to produce on the screen some visual stimuli. The two operations have to be synchronized because the time component is crucial I need to see the responses of brain to certain stimuli, which blinks at a certain frequency. I made both the acquisition and the stimulation, but I can not put the two things together. I have the same problem in Matlab, and I can not figure it out in C. I do not know what solution could help me parallelism, multithreading or something else, so any advice is welcome.

When building for WP8 you cant compile .c files or use old C syntax code the one where function parameters are specified twice.p  pLibpng is easily compilable under C as it doesnt use old synax code but libz isnt. I havent been able to find a suitable replacement for libz that can compile for these environments.p  pI tried MiniZ which lacks dunno why definitions for functions like inflatereset, then I found no solution to loading pngs alternatively under Windows Phone 8 from native C code you can use WIC on Windows 8 but the library doesnt exist for ARM builds.p  pTheres also this  a hrefhttpsgithub.comdooZIPWinRT relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdooZIPWinRTa but it uses managed classes and is only useful if you want to extract zip files. Previous libz dependent code wont compile and I need it for libpng to compile basically.p  pPlease do not comment if you dont know what these flags mean p  pWindows Store App supportp  pConsume Windows runtime extensionp

Negative 656 pThis is running on SQL Server 2008.p  pAnyway, I have sales data, and I can write a query to get the output to look like thisp  precodeid  Name        Period   Sales 1   Customer X  201301  50 1   Customer X  201302  45 codepre  petc. Currently, after running this data, I am rearranging the data in the code behind so that the final output looks like thisp  precodeid   Name        201301  201302 1    Customer X    50       40 codepre  pThe issues arep  ol liThe date YYYYMM range is an input from the user. li liIf the user selects more outputs like, say, address, and a ton of other possible fields relating to that customer, that information is duplicated in emeveryem line. When youre doing 1015 items per line, over a period of 5 years, for 50000 users, this causes problems with running out of memory, and is also inefficient.li ol  pIve considered pulling only the necessary data the customer id  how theyre joined together, the period, and the sales figure, and then after the fact running a separate query to get the additional data. This doesnt seem like it would be efficient though, but its a possibility.p  pThe other, which is what Im thinking should be the best option, would be to rewrite my query to go ahead and do what my current code behind is doing, and pivot the data together, that way the customer data is never duplicated and Im not moving a lot of unnecessary data around.p  pTo give a better example of what Im working with, lets assume these tablesp  pAddressp  precodeid  HouseNum  Street  Unit  City  State codepre  pCustomerp  precodeid  Name   codepre  pSalesp  precodeid  Period  Sales codepre  pSo I would like to join these tables on the customer id, display all of the address data, assume the user inputs 201201  201212, I can translate that into 201201, 201202 ... 201212 in my code behind to input into the query before it executes, so I have that available.p  pWhat I want it to look like would bep  precodeid  Name  HouseNum  Street    City  State  201201  201202  ...  201212 1   X     100       Main St.  ABC   DEF      30              ...    20 codepre  pno sales data for that customer on 201202  if any of the data is blank I want it to be a blank string , not a NULLp  pI realize I may not be explaining this the best way possible, so just let me know and Ill add more information. Thank youp  pedit oh, one last thing. Would it be possible to add a Min, Max, Avg, amp Total columns to the end, which sum up all of the pivoted data It wouldnt be a big deal to do it on the code behind, but the more sql server can do for me the better, imop  pedit One more, the period is in the tables as 201301 etc, but Id like to rename them to Jan 2013 etc, if its not too complicatedp

Negative 656 pIm using Assimp to load 3D models into my program. Everything has gone dandy so far, except Ive come across a Lightwave object that doesnt seem to make sense. Of course it renders nicely in Lightwave, but in Assimp there are no texture coordinates, no UV coordinates, but textures that end up getting loaded. But that doesnt help  they just sit in memory and never get used because  you guessed it  there are no texture coordinates.p  pI havent found any helpful Assimp pages so far on this. Other models load fine and are properly texturemapped. Is this a problem with Assimpp

Negative 656 pWe have an ASP.NET application that handles user uploaded files. Browser sends a multipart POST request. We have a simple HttpHandler and use HttpRequest.Files to access the uploaded file. It is running on IIS7.5 on Windows 2008 R2.p  pOccasionally, we see an error that the colletion contains 0 files. Upon inspecting HttpRequest.InputStream we see that we have an incomplete POST request. The ContentLength header indicates there should be more data, than there is.p  pWe manage to reproduce it using Fiddler  sending a request with requestBody lt ContentLength.   The application hangs on the first reference to HttpRequest.Params.   Terminate Fiddler, that closes the connection and application resumes. The application logic  as the body is incomplete 0 files.p  pI assume this is a scenario we have to deal with and cant do much about. After all the browser may close connection any time.p  pI wonder if there is some switch that would prevent IIS to handoff incomplete POST request to the application layer i.e. some buffer. This would eliminate some noise in the ApplicationLayer error monitoring.p  pThanks, Piotrp

Negative 656 pIm using codeorgmodecode Emacs 24.3.1, orgmode del7.9.3fdel 8.0.6 for a database of code snippets in different languages so far mainly elisp and python. This works very nice using orgmodebabel, i.e. after creating a code field as explained in a hrefhttporgmode.orgguideWorkingWithSourceCode.html relnofollowthe documentationa I can edit the code using the correct majormode by issueing codeCc code i.e. codeorgeditspecialcode. However, when editing C source snippets such as  p  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodebeginsrc c stdvectorltintgt v 100  stdiota stdbegin v , stdend v , 0   Fill with 0, 1, ..., 99. endsrc codepre  pThe error message   p  pre classlangelisp prettyprintoverridecodebytecode Language mode cmode fails with Buffer Org Src snippets.org[ c ] has no process codepre  pis prined codesnippets.orgcode is the name of the file I use to store the snippets.

I think this might be solved if codeacccmodeclangconfigcode is only executed when Im doing genuine C edits not codeorgmodecode c edits. Any ideas how to solve thisp

For some reason, only setting remove to false seems to work for me, not sure if this is because of subclassing.p  pI am checking for the attr modelid, because it seems that Collections call fetch initially on their own when initialized and set some sort of object I believe another collection as its first model initially.

Negative 656 pThe webapplet I am building is an interactive 3D display of an architectural 3D model with buttons and text input fields overlaid on it that allow users to login. When an awt textfield is used in a Processing sketch it displays and runs correctly when run from the Processing IDE but when the sketch is exported as applet and loaded through any browser all texfields render solid black.p  pThe applet can be seen in action on this video  a hrefhttpsvimeo.com68475579 relnofollowhttpsvimeo.com68475579a and in reality you can experience the problem here when trying to login or create a new user  a hrefhttpwww.boxinacloud.combiac relnofollowhttpwww.boxinacloud.combiacap  pIn general there are few libraries for GUI in Processing such as the controlP5 and I have tried using all of them before resorting to awts TextField. Reason is ControlP5 has the same problem for all its UI components  they render black in a browser. Other libraries G4P, interfascia, etc. either dont have version for Processing 1.51 or dont offer a Textfield class or have issues with displaying the text in legible graphics  probably because of the P3D display mode which is used in my case.p  pUnfortunately Processing 1.5.1 must be used instead of the latest 2.0. This is because PeasyCam library and other specifics to the code that has been written so far are not compatible with Processing 2.0.p  pI am open to suggestions for other TextField classes or any hints as to what might cause the problem of the TextField built in AWT to render black.p  pBelow is the code used to generate the TextFields with awtp  precodeimport java.awt.  textfields Panel dummyPanel  new Panel  voodoo   Panel usernamePanel  new Panel  holder for input field  TextField usernameField  new TextField   Panel passwordPanel  new Panel  holder for input field  TextField passwordField  new TextField   Panel password2Panel  new Panel  holder for input field  TextField password2Field  new TextField   Panel emailPanel  new Panel  holder for input field  TextField emailField  new TextField         give all the containers a layout  setLayoutnew BorderLayout  main container window  usernamePanel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout  passwordPanel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout  password2Panel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout  emailPanel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout   add the containers to the main container    Now we can set the bounds of the text fields  left, top, width, height  int borderSize  100  for calculating size of fields  int inputHeight  20  height of input field  usernamePanel.setBounds618, 85, 100061815, inputHeight  passwordPanel.setBounds618, 135, 100061815, inputHeight  password2Panel.setBounds618, 185, 100061815, inputHeight  emailPanel.setBounds618, 235, 100061815, inputHeight   usernamePanel.setBackgroundnew Color128, 128, 128, 0  passwordPanel.setBackgroundnew Color128, 128, 128, 0  password2Panel.setBackgroundnew Color128, 128, 128, 0  emailPanel.setBackgroundnew Color128, 128, 128, 0   Dont know why this works but it does.

Negative 656 pI have read quite a few answers on this forum, so hopefully I am asking something. Recently we moved to Tomcat 7 and usual procedure is to pick up a war file from Nexus repository, stick it in tomcat webapps dir and start the server and use it. But due to war file artifact name in Nexus being myappwar1.0.war context path in tomcat is not what is expected. I know that this can be configured by context.xml, but I was wondering if there is a way to add  to artifact name that is deployed in Nexus.p  pI tried changing project.build.finalName but it only changes artifact name in target directory, maven deploy plugin still uses artifactId, which is myappwar. So artifact in Nexus ends up being myappwar1.0.war As artifactId in maven has a quite strict structure and  is not allowed there I was wondering what would be the right way of adding  to artifact name, as we are very likely to consider to use parallel deployment, so I am looking for ways to enable this functionality.p  pI guess I could deploy two versions of the same war file to Nexus, one being named slightly differentwith , but then its easier to just rename it and save some space. I wonder was there any plan how would the  would be added to application name, when Parallel naming feature was implemented in Tomcat.p

The trouble is the textarea should display the description for the code entered in the option value, again taken from the database, but without button and so I cant use the post method when I select the codart by the option value, the textarea should automatically show me the corresponding description taken by sql db.

Negative 656 pLets say I have a website with frontend and backend. The website allows users to upload some data ranging from hundreds of MB to GB. How do you effectively upload these datap  ul liThe easiest way would be to upload it from clientbrowser to the frontend server. Then send it via API or something to the backend server which has connected data storage, where well save the data. This would, however, run really slow, because the upload will be twice as big.li liAnother way that occured to me would be to send the data directly from javascript running inside the browser to the backends API. This can be inappropriate when I dont want the backendbackends API to be accessible to public. Its also not good for the architecture if you have fe and be, you probably dont want to comunicate from client to be.li ul  pSo, do you have any ideas Or is there some kind of general way to do this effectively Does it include CDNs Or should I store the data in a database as base64 strings if itd only be few hundreds of MB pre file Thanks.p  pEDIT I just thought of using a Amazon S3 for this. This raises similar question where is the upload to S3 going to happen.

Negative 656 pIs it possible to get the file type using the UI Automation p  pIn a folder if i have multiple files with same name but different extensions, and I have to select a file using the screen coordinates.

Negative 656 pIve got a VB.Net application I inherited that has an annoying issue with the textboxes.p  pThey dont seem to behave in a standard manner. For example, pressing CtrlA with the cursor in them doesnt select all. Mouse wheel wont scroll the box.p  pBut the main issue that I want to get fixed is the paste problem. When I have text on the clipboard, and I paste, the contentc of the box are not appended to. Instead they are overwritten. p  pIts not a case of accidentally having all of the contents selected when I paste. Even when Im very careful to have nothing selected, the contents are overwritten.p  pThis happens with all textboxes in this application. So far Ive browsed through the properties of one of the TextBoxes to see if anything looked related  nothing did. I searched the code to see if a property was set somewhere to account for this  nothing was. And I Googled and checked here but couldnt find a simmilar issue.p  pI dont work in VB often so I might be missing something obvious  but I cant find the answer anywhere.p  pAnd just to see what would happen I just added a new TextBox. It had the same behavior despite my putting it in and not modifying any of its properties or writing any code related to it.p  pBeing able to append text to what is present in these textboxes would be really helpful for the people who use this program.p  pThanks for taking the time to read my question, and for any help you can providep  pI dont know what aditional info might be helpful, so if you need anything let me know.p
Negative 656 pIve got a fairly complicated project, which heavily uses Javas multithreading. In an answer to one of my previous questions I have described an ugly hack, which is supposed to overcome inherent inability to iterate over Javas codeConcurrentHashMapcode in parallel. Although it works, I dont like ugly hacks, and Ive had a lot of trouble trying to introduce proposed proof of concept in the real system. Trying to find an alternative solution I have encountered Scalas codeParHashMapcode, which claims to implement a codeforeachcode method, which seems to operate in parallel. Before I start learning a new language to implement a single feature Id like to ask the followingp  p1 Is codeforeachcode method of Scalas codeParHashMapcode scalablep  p2 Is it simple and straightforward to call Javas code from Scala and vice versa Ill just remind that the code is concurrent and uses generics.p  p3 Is there going to be a performance penalty for switching a part of codebase to Scalap  pFor reference, this is my previous question about parallel iteration of codeConcurrentHashMapcodep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19860217scalablewaytoaccesseveryelementofconcurrenthashmapelementbooleanexacScalable way to access every element of ConcurrentHashMapltElement, Booleangt exactly onceap  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have implemented the proof of concept, in probably very nonidiomatic Scala, but it works just fine.

Negative 656 pI am working on a project for tracking objects with many textures with many color variations.  Unlike normal tracking using color masking, my target object is vastly different since it contains several dominant color distribution.p  pI want to detect the object and start tracking. For tracking there are methods like Kalman Filter but however, to track textured object, I need to track the local keypoints I suppose. If I compute SURF descriptor in every frame, than this will forfeit the use of tracking I thinkmaybe I am wrong here.p  pI feel that I should just use SURF in the first frame to initialised the target object and than thereafter track it. My problem here is how do I track the features of the textured object. I done some research but I seem not to get how to go about solving that.p  pIt would be great if I can get some suggestion or paper links to read and implement it. p

Negative 656 pI am running into a really strange problem.

Negative 656 pI have a closed Bezier Path. It is currently masking a UIView in the normal way, meaning that only the parts of the view that are within the bounds of the path are visible. I have now decided on an aesthetic feature that would be very easy to implement if there were a way to antimask with the same bezier path. What I mean is that now I would like a different UIView, which is currently totally visible outside of the path, to be cut off as soon as it intersects with the Bezier Path.

Negative 656 pI have written a small application to display large pointclouds of vertices of usual size  20m points consisting of position values xyz and colour values RGB.p  pI experianced no issues on a workstation with a Nvidia GTX 670 GPU but have now changed to another workstation with a AMD HD6950 and now large pointclouds are not being displayed.p  pI originally thought that there might be a limit to the number of vertices that the AMD GPU can draw in a single call but after additional testing think that this is not the case.p  pI generated a test pointcloud done with simple for loops larger then the other point clouds and with the same format [vc3xyz amp vec3rgb] and this cloud still displays but not the other large pointcloud from the laser scanner. Looking at the VBO states in CodeXL these are all present and of the correct size 233MB for 20m vec3s so i cannot see where the error might be unless the nondebug pointcloud is obtaining incorrect values from somewhere.p  pIts also worth noting that I have used small pointclouds 30k vertices and they load fine but not the large ones on the AMD computer.p  pAs a sanity check this is the code for generating the debug pointcloudp  precode Holders for position and colour stdvectorltglmvec3gt tposition stdvectorltglmvec3gt tcolour   Reserve memory tposition.reservepointcloudsize tcolour.reservepointcloudsize   Generate Data for int x0 x lt cuberoot x      for int y0 y lt cuberoot y          for int z0 z lt cuberoot z              tposition.pushbackglmvec3x10.0  0.5, y10.0 0.5, z10.0 0.5             tcolour.pushbackglmvec3floatx10.0,floaty10.0,floatz10.0                codepre  pand this is the method for generating the laserscanner pointcloudp  precodepclPointCloudltpclPointXYZRGBNormalgtPtr pointcloud new pclPointCloudltpclPointXYZRGBNormalgt  if pclioloadPCDFilepointcloudpath, pointcloud  1  Loading pointcloud from file path.

Negative 656 pIm having trouble with a programming problem here. Half the trouble is that the problem itself is quite tricky to think about, and the other half is that I cant remember how to find my way around QuickCheck.p  pI know that if you write a function that takes several arguments that have an codeArbitrarycode instance, QuickCheck will let you use that method as a test. What I cant figure out is how to generate new test arguments inside that method.

I vaguely remember QuickCheck having a function somewhere to throw away inputs not satisfying a given condition. The only problem being that it might take an unreasonably number of attempts to satisfy the condition...p  pIs there a way to do this Im staring at the Haddock page, but I cant figure out how to get what I want...p

Negative 656 pI am building a RESTful API where users may create resources on my server using post requests, and later reference them via get requests, etc. One thing Ive had trouble deciding on is what IDs the clients should have. I know that there are many ways to do what Im trying to accomplish, but Id like to go with a design which follows industry conventions and best design practices.p  pShould my API decide on the ID for each newly created resource it would most likely be the primary key for the resource assigned by the database Or should I allow users to assign their own reference numbers to their resourcesp  pIf I do assign a reference number to each new resource, how should this be returned to the client The API has some endpoints which allow for bulk item creation, so I would need to list out all of the newly created resources on every responsep  pIm conflicted because allowing the user to specify their own IDs is obviously a can of worms  Id need to verify each ID hasnt been taken, makes database queries a lot weirder as Id be joining on reference and userID rather than foreign key. On the other hand, if I assign IDs to each resource it requires clients to have to build some type of response parser and forces them to follow my imposed conventions.p

Negative 656 pWhen one clicks on a Matplotlib graph, the coordinates of the current point are normally displayed.p  pHowever, when tick labels are set with codepyplot.ytickscode, for example before a codepyplot.plotcode, nothing is displayed for the label coordinate Matplotlib displays an empty codey code, in this case.  Is there a simple way of having Matplotlib display the tick labels instead ideally without using the event handling machinery, which can probably do thisp

Negative 656 pTo start with,I am pretty new to 3D programming and libgdx. I looked at a few tutorials and I already render the scene I want. I have some 1x1x1 blocks, created with codeModelBuilder.createRectcode for every visible face, so if another block covers a face of this block, there is no rect created for this block. Also the top and bottom rect is not needed, as I can never see them except for the floor. SoIthought, that this is pretty efficient. I also have codeBackface cullingcode enabled and I do codeViewfrustum cullingcode. However, if I look in a direction, where many blocks are in my viewfrustum the FPS go down to 1520. This is still okay for me, as my laptop is over  5 years old and its performance is not the best, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma221069583182091this answera made me think.p  pModelBuilder is used for debug only. Okay, but how should i then create my boxes Why should i create a codeModelcode in a Modeling app like Blender, for simple squares By doing this i couldnt even cull the faces, which are occupied by other blocks. So my question is How can i create and render those boxes the most efficient wayp

So, I am searching for a solution, that I hope all of you can help me with.p  pHow can we do this in other browsers Can I make a plugin that wraps the COM object Keep in mind, the only way to communicate with the PBX software is to use this COMobject. Security is not an issue as this web solution is only used inhouse and we trust the software COMobject. p

Negative 656 pI have to solve a theoretical problem and just want to get feedback about the best pattern  practice to solve this in android.p  pTask An app could have several activities  fragments showing a list of objects. If one object is present in more than one list at the same time, I want to synchronize changes to this object. So e.g. if I delete the object it should disappear in all lists.p  pThe restricts are thatp  ul liI dont know which lists are currently instantiatedli liEvery list has its own object instance. Data is not shared directly between listsli ul  pMy solution so far would be top  ul lidefine a Storage class which provides methods for data accessli licreate a custom Application class and instantiate the Storage class with the application context which is needed for e.g. content provider accessli lithe Storage class defines a Listener where each activity can register itselfli liif an activity modifies an object, which it has to do through the Application Storage, the Storage class sends an event to each activity  fragment registered so they can adopt the changes.li ul  pDoes anyone know a better solution for that And is my solution conform with the android lifecyclep  pThanks a lot for every kind of useful feedbackp

Negative 656 pI have a list where I want to mark the checkedselected row as being sticky to prevent the selected item from scrolling out of the view. I have tried implementing a hrefhttpsgithub.comemilsjolanderStickyListHeaders relnofollowhttpsgithub.comemilsjolanderStickyListHeadersa, but since it is not possible to call codeaddHeadercode after calling codesetAdaptercode, I can not figure out how to do this dynamically if even possible based on when a list item is clicked which is updated in codegetViewcode of a custom adapter adapter.p  pI have also looked at similar libraries, but their implementation seems to be much like the one I have already tried. The author of codeStickyListHeaderscode is for example also the author of another similar library for codeScrollViewcode, but this is also not what I want, since you have to add children of each header item respectively. p  pSo basically, I need a regular ListView where the clicked selected item is made sticky.p

Negative 656 pI have a rather long form where a user has to fill in some sections and leave others blank depending on their circumstances and then I will save the sections to a database. To help visitors stay organized I have utilized jQuery UIs Accordion to divide the form into sections.p  pNow that the form is built Im trying to find a way to display just the sections they filled in so they can print them off. If I simply bring up the form and they try to print it, it will print the accordion sections.p  pRight now Im thinking of getting all the divs that have inputs filled in, combining them, and then sending them off to the DB to be saved so I can call them up later. This seems a little sloppy to me and I would prefer something tidier and that would be considered best practices. If anyone has a better, neater, more efficient way of doing this I would appreciate your input Thanksp

Negative 656 pThis may be annoying and discussed before but I could not find a good reference which would help to set a direction. I have to plan a migration of TopLink 10g Spring 2.5 ORM Native Support to JPA. I need some guidelines steps to follow and plan a successful migration.p  pLet me brief what I have in my technology stack. Primarily, as I mentioned above, application build around Spring 2.5 and Spring 2.5 Native ORM Support of TopLink. Spring 2.5 bundled to support only up to TopLink 10g and if you simply upgrade the TopLink JAR with the latest version it would not work as latest version of TopLink has completely changed the packaging but this still can be tackled by easily find and replace the package names. The main issue is the native api of TopLink ORM in Spring 2.5 which is built around TopLink 10g.p  pThe reason of this migration activity is we cannot upgrade Spring until we migrate datalayer to JPA.p  pPlease share steps if you already achieved something similar in your past or if the above briefing gives you an understanding on the problem you can also drop your opinion on how should I plan this migration.p

Negative 656 pIm sorry if my question isnt too well formulated, Im only now getting started with FFmpeg and Libav. Im not too knowledgable about media formats either, I pretty much learned all I know about the topic this past month. Ive been doing as much research as I can, and have gotten pretty far, but Ive only now gotten to the point where Im almost unsure what my question actually is These are more like observations, but hopefully some of the experts can help me out here.p  pIm trying to transcode Gifs into MP4s using FFmpegs libraries, but Im running into a strange issue when using the H264 Codec. In my transcoding loop, I keep a count of the number of frames that I write out by verifying the return value of avwriteframe. In a particular sample, I count a total of 166 frames written out. If I examine FFmpegs converted file using FFprobe the functionality Im wanting to emulate using my program, a conversion from Gif to MP4, FFmpegs output file also seems to have 166 frames, but when I examine my output with FFprobe, I seem to only have 144 frames. What I find a bit interesting is that if I simply change my codec from H264 to MPEG4, my output appears to have the 166 frames, matching FFmpegs output and my counter. I get very similar results with different Gif files, where my counter of frames written matches FFmpegs outputs frame count, but my output seems to drop some frames. p  pEncoder settingsp  precodeostreamcodeccontextgtcodecid  CODECINUSE  CODECIDH264 or CODECIDMPEG4 ostreamcodeccontextgtpixfmt  AVPIXFMTYUV420P ostreamcodeccontextgtcodectype  AVMEDIATYPEVIDEO ostreamcodeccontextgtflags  CODECFLAGGLOBALHEADER ostreamcodeccontextgtprofile  FFPROFILEMPEG4SIMPLE  ostreamcodeccontextgtgopsize  istreamcodeccontextgtgopsize ostreamcodeccontextgttimebase  istreamcodeccontextgttimebase  ostreamcodeccontextgtwidth   istreamcodeccontextgtwidth   2  2 ostreamcodeccontextgtheight  istreamcodeccontextgtheight  2  2     codepre  pTranscoding loopp  pemIve omitted some errorchecking code and debugging statementsemp  precodeavformatwriteheaderoformatcontext, NULL while avreadframeiformatcontext, amppacket  0       if packet.streamindex  istreamindex               avcodecdecodevideo2istreamcodeccontext, ipicture, ampfullframe, amppacket       if fullframe                  swsscaleimageconversioncontext,                     uint8t const  const  ipicturegtdata,                    ipicturegtlinesize, 0, istreamcodeccontextgtheight,                    opicturegtdata, opicturegtlinesize           opicturegtpts  avrescaleqpacket.pts, istreamcodeccontextgttimebase,                                       ostreamgttimebase           ret  avcodecencodevideo2ostreamcodeccontext, amppacket,                                       opicture, ampgotpacket          if ret                       ret  avwriteframeoformatcontext, amppacket             if ret lt 0                numframeswritten                         avfreepacketamppacket    avinitpacketamppacket  codepre  pIm also having issues with my outputs bitrate.

Negative 656 pI dont know if this is possible, and I dont necessarily need to do it in the way Ive envisioned here so if you have a better idea on how to accomplish the same thing please do tell.p  pI have an enterprise project that contains several assemblies used by other projects. Every time I update the enterprise project, I have to copy over the appropriate assemblies into the SharedDependencies folder for whichever UI project uses them. As you can imagine, it gets frustrating during testing when we forget to copy them over. We cant automatically copy them as a post build event because if we make breaking changes then we dont want all projects using the assembly to automatically get the new version.p  pWhat I think would be ideal is if I could write a prebuild command that would check to see if there is a newer assembly available and throw a warning if there is. Im not sure how I would go about doing that thoughp

Negative 656 pI am trying to simulate sequences in MySql. I have read on SO and elsewhere several suggestions on how to do this.  I believe I am doing it correctly.  I have an update statement that increments a column in my sequence table that looks like thisp  precodequery  UPDATE sequence SET id  LASTINSERTIDid  1 WHERE sequenceid  MySequenceName int rowsUpdated  statement.executeUpdatequery codepre  pThen after a successful update, I retrieve the sequence value via SELECT LASTINSERTID.p  pThis works well until the system is heavily loaded. When heavily loaded, I sometimes get a zero value as the rowsUpdated value. I assume this is because two threads were doing the update at the same time. I figure that each thread is getting the same value for id, incrementing it and then both updating sequenceid with the same value. So, thread 1 would get rowsUpdated to be 1, but since thread 2 is updating with the same value, no change is made and rowsUpdated for thread 2 is 0.p  pI am running MySql version 5.1. My transaction level on the connection is READCOMMITTED. The column sequenceid is the primary key on the table. I am using separate connections for each thread. Oddly, I have several installations of this code that are just as heavily loaded, but not experiencing this issue.  I am considering upgrading the version of MySql at this site, but I havent seen any talk about that being the issue.p  pIs it incorrect to think that the update statement should be locking the table row PRIOR to reading id, incrementing it and doing the updatep

Negative 656 pIm sure some changes been done yesterday by someone else.p  pThe behavior of a stored procedure changed, the procedure copies data from some other tables to a codeMainTablecode one by one and also do some other processes.p  precodeinsert into logTablepart 1 started, getdate  insert into mainTable    select  from table1   insert into logTablepart 2 started, getdate  insert into mainTable    select  from table2  ....... .......  insert into logTablecomplete, getdate codepre  pData inserted used to show up right away in the codeMainTablecode, and in the log table can see each process goes right after data inserted.p  pBut now seems like all data in codeMainTablecode, and codelogTablecode, shows up only after final complete.p  pThere is nothing changed in the procedure but I think p  pIs this kind of transaction settingp  pHow can I set it backp  pThanksp
Negative 656 pIve read Oracles API hundreds of times, read countless articles, both here and elsewhere, and i still cannot resize columns after the jtable becomes visible.brbr As you can deduce, im also trying to set the visibilty of the columns using jcheckboxes.  Using addColumn and removeColumn, as other articles have noted, does not return columns to their original positions.  Ive previously used an additional class to hold column information eg the column itself, its identifier and original index.  This became messy as well the problem of addingremoving data after a columns visibility has been changed.  I noticed the data was not in its correct column. As a result, ive opted for setting the columns minWidth, preferredWidth and maxWidth.brbrp  pNow to my problem, the below code does not adjust the columns width when setColumnVisible is set to true.

I use another jtable to display user selections column1 selected font family, column2 font style, column3 font size, column4 alphabet, column5 digits, column6 punctuation and column7 symbols.brbr The user will be allowed to select which columns are visible.  As ive mentioned though, when the display table is updated, the data is not where its supposed to be.  ie the user chooses to hide columns, digits and symbols and then selects a new fonts, styles and size to be displayed.p

Negative 656 pI am running linuxUbuntu and have been disaponted with the quality of code snippet managers. None work for howwhat I like so I am building my own basic version. I am doing this also for the coding practice.p  pSo I am going to use QT5 and SQLite to run an in application database. From my previous experience with databases if you want to save 2 or 3 pages of text you usally dont want to save it directly to the database. You want to have the text in a file or something else and then have a link or file location stored in the database so it points to the text. p  pIf I go that route should I have a separate file for each code snippet. Seems overkill. Maybe I should have some set maximum file size and as code snippets get added you create a new file and begin to add to that one. If I do that I think I would need to have and offset stored in the DB so it can quickly get to the wanted code snippet. p  pAre there any other architectural ideas for how to store the code so that it would scale if someone had a lot of different code snippets with some of those code snippets being very large Are there other considerations I should be aware ofp

Negative 656 pI have a set of soap APIs which can perform actions like login,logout,keepalive,access other several resources.Inorder to access the other resources,I have to pass a session id which I got from the login api.The session gets time out in 5minutes.

But then when I deployed my app and went to the public ip, it gives me a 403 saying I dont have permission to access  on the server or anything else. What I am confused about is that I got the example one working and so it does not have anything to do with permissions of my home directory like everyone else is saying on stackoverflow.

Negative 656 pI use an external library which operates on large quantities of data. The data is passed in by a raw pointer, plus the length. The library does not claim ownership of the pointer, but invokes a provided callback function with the same two arguments when it is done with the data.p  pThe data gets prepared conveniently by using codestdvectorltTgtcode, and Id rather not give up this convenience. Copying the data is completely out of the question. Thus, I need a way to take over the memory buffer owned by an codestdvectorltTgtcode, and later on deallocate it in the callback.p  pMy current solution looks as followsp  precodestdvectorltTgt input  prepareinput T  data  input.data sizet size  input.size  move the vector to raw storage, to prevent deallocation alignasstdvectorltTgt char temp[sizeofstdvectorltTgt] new temp stdvectorltTgtstdmoveinput  invoke the library libstartProcesingdata, size codepre  pand, in the callback functionp  precodevoid callbackT  data, sizet size      stdallocatorltTgt.deallocatedata, size  codepre  pThis solution works, because the standard allocators codedeallocatecode function ignores its second argument the element count and simply calls codeoperator deletedatacode. If it did not, bad things could happen, as the codesizecode of the input vector might be quite a bit smaller than its codecapacitycode.p  pMy question is is there a reliable wrt. the C standard way of taking over the buffer of codestdvectorcode and releasing it manually at some later timep

Negative 656 pI have a facebook like chat head with some pop up text. I am experience a strange behavior when resizing the view. I have attached an image in hope of making this issue clearerp  pa hrefhttpimgur.comTMJkmiK relnofollowImage to describe problemap  pThe black box represents the size of the relative layout, the red circle is a rounded image and the green box is some text from a message.

The next thing I do is after a couple seconds I change the textview back to gone and this is where I see the issue.p  pInstead of resizing the view back to step 1 as expected it instead resizes to the size of the image but aligned to as far as the text had grown and then quickly but noticeably moves back to the original position.p  pIts sort of a confusing problem to detail so I hope the image makes it a bit better.p  pFrom my code I inflate a layout and then apply some settingsp  precodecontainer  RelativeLayout LayoutInflater.fromthis.inflateR.layout.container, null params  new WindowManager.LayoutParams WindowManager.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, WindowManager.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPEPHONE, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGNOTFOCUSABLE  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGLAYOUTNOLIMITS, PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT params.gravity  Gravity.BOTTOM  Gravity.RIGHT windowManager.addViewcontainer, params codepre  pThe xml for the layout isp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt  ltFrameLayout     androidididtextpreview     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheight40dp     androidlayoutalignTopidchathead     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidbackgrounddrawablebubblebackground     androidvisibilitygonegt      ltTextView         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidellipsizeend         androidgravitycentervertical         androidmaxLines1         androidmaxWidth200dp         androidtextSize16sp gt ltFrameLayoutgt  ltRoundedImageView     androidididchathead     androidlayoutwidth53dp     androidlayoutheight53dp     androidlayouttoRightOfidtextpreview     androidvisibilityinvisible gt ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre

Negative 656 pIm writing a kiosk application in C .net 4.5 where Ill be handling credit card information read from a card reader, and my goal is to prevent malware from being able to analyze memory snapshots to find credit card data.  This will be running on Windows Embedded POSReady 7 x64. p  pThe data never exists outside memory on the kiosk, but not everyone is as careful with details as I am, so Im looking for a compiler flag, or class attribute, etc.. that will automatically encrypt all data space memory, and automatically handle decryption and memory cleanup as necessary.  Are there any libraries or compiler switches that can accomplish this easily p  pMy current solution reads the CC data in clear text from the CC reader device, then immediately encrypts the data and overwrites memory previously occupied by clear text data.  The data is only decrypted for brief moments as its needed for sending to the CC gateway for processing.  My implementation is good, but mistakes happen, and not everyone here is as careful as I am, so an automatic solution such as a compiler switch to encrypt all memory would be best if such a thing exists.  p

And Call the Proxy Methods.p  pEverthing was Working Smooth, until  DOB was needed for a Particular method.p  pWhen this Link was opened in browser we found XML format.p  pcodeltxsdelement nameDOB typexsddate minOccurs0gtcodep  pClearly DOB ask for date datatype. But the Reference.cs holding all the Proxy Components of the WSDL understood it as.p  precodeprivate System.DateTime dOBField  [System.Xml.Serialization.SoapElementAttributeDataTypedate]         public System.DateTime DOB              get                  return this.dOBField                          set                  this.dOBField  value                       codepre  pWe did  little bit of research on Date for C. C is unaware of the Concept of Date. It only understands DateTime.p  pFor Example. if we try parse a string to Date, Lets take todays date 28thJan.p  precodestring today  20150128 DateTime dtToday  DateTime.ParseExacttoday , yyyyMMdd, null.Date codepre  pThe Value of dtToday will be 20150128 120000AM. But we just asked for Date.p  pNow Comes the Real issue Whenever we are trying to Set Date for the DOB proxy property it is type casting it to DateTime something like 20090227 121222PMp  pBut PHP is expecting for something like 20090227. We tried Editing the Reference.cs. It threw Exception at time of Proxy Object initialization.p  pSo Please Anybody guide us some way out.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 656 pThere are a few tutorials and examples online that discuss making a mask for a custom shape dialog.  In C there is a hrefhttpwww.codeprogress.comcpplibrariesqtshowQtExample.phpindex145ampkeyQMainWindowPartialTransparent relnofollowthisa.  For python there is a hrefhttpunlogic.co.uk20110527shapelywindowinpyqt relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpftp.ics.uci.edupubcentos0icscustombuildBUILDPyQtx11gpl4.7.2exampleswidgetsshapedclock.py relnofollowthisa.  p  pI have been trying to use an image as a mask, and based on the c example, as well as the qt documentation, I came up withp  precodeclass myDialogQtGui.QDialog, UiDialog     def initself, parentNone         supermyDialog, self.initparentparent         self.setupUiself          pixmap  QtGui.QPixmapbackgroundMask.png         self.setMaskpixmap.mask         palette  QtGui.QPalette         palette.setBrushQtGui.QPalette.Background,QtGui.QBrushQtGui.QPixmapbackgroundMask.png         self.setWindowFlagsQtCore.Qt.FramelessWindowHint         self.setPalettepalette codepre  pThis sets the background to my png file, but instead of transparency, the transparent parts are black.  As a check p  precodeprint pixmap.hasAlpha print pixmap.hasAlphaChannel codepre  pBoth print to codeTruecode.p  pIf I use only a region such as p  precodemaskedRegion  QtGui.QRegion300  75, 150  75, 75, 75, QtGui.QRegion.Ellipse self.setMaskmaskedRegion codepre  pThe mask works.  p  pHowever, from the Qt Documentation, setMaskp  blockquote   pvoid QPixmapsetMask  const QBitmap amp mask    Sets a mask bitmap. This function merges the mask with the pixmaps   alpha channel. A pixel value of 1 on the mask means the pixmaps pixel   is unchanged a value of 0 means the pixel is transparent. The mask   must have the same size as this pixmap. Setting a null mask resets the   mask, leaving the previously transparent pixels black. The effect of   this function is undefined when the pixmap is being painted on.p blockquote  pThere is no mention of using a QRegion as input for setMask.  It also seems that the transparent pixels black is what happens to me.  However there is no indication of why it is a null mask.  So I tried to find some more information on setMask.p  pIn the QPixmap a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qpixmap.htmlsetMask relnofollowreferenceap  blockquote   pThe hasAlphaChannel returns true if the pixmap has a format that   respects the alpha channel, otherwise returns false. The hasAlpha,   setMask and mask functions are legacy and should not be used. They   are potentially very slow.p blockquote  pThe rest of the Alpha information isp  blockquote   pThe createHeuristicMask function creates and returns a 1bpp   heuristic mask i.e. a QBitmap for this pixmap. It works by selecting   a color from one of the corners and then chipping away pixels of that   color, starting at all the edges. The createMaskFromColor function   creates and returns a mask i.e. a QBitmap for the pixmap based on a   given color.p blockquote  pSo it seems I can replace codemaskcode with codecreateMaskFromColorcode.  However, there is no explanation of how to actually set the mask, as both these new functions just return a mask.  So if I am not supposed to use codesetMaskcode how can I set a maskp  pSince setMask works with a region, I assume my own issue is not solely due to the documentation saying not to use setMask, but my question is what the alternative is, so I can debug using a modern method. p

Negative 656 pImagine you have a message class as part of your online messaging system. A message instance can be viewed, edited and deleted by the sender, or viewed and deleted by the receiver. p  pNotice that both the sender and receiver can interact with the instance, but that some of the same state cant be shared among the sender and the receiver. If the receiver deletes the message, the sender should still be able to access it. Both should be able to read the same message, though, rather than have their own copy. Youll also have things like read receipts, where the other party should see the other sides state.p  pObviously you could have a sender and receiver version of everything, like codeissenderdeletedcode and codeisreceiverdeletedcode. This feels quite hard to work with, so I wasnt sure it was the right approach.p  pMy question is, how could you model this using objectorientated programming I tried searching for a while, but couldnt come across any discussions on the topic.p

Negative 656 pI have a number of large tables in Google BigQuery, containing data to be processed in R. I am running RStudio via Docker on Google Cloud Platform using the Container Engine.p  pI have tested a few routes with a table of 38 million rows three columns with a table size of 862 MB in BigQuery.p  pThe first route I tested was using the R package bigrquery. This option was preferred as data can be directly queried from BigQuery. And dataacquisition can be incorporated in R loops. This option is unfortunately very slow, it takes close to an hour to complete.p  pThe second option I tried was exporting the BigQuery table to a csv file on Google Cloud Storage approx 1 minute, and using the public link to import in Rstudio another 5 minutes. This route entails quite some manual handling, which is at least not desirable. p  pIn Google Cloud Console I noticed VM instances can be granted access to BigQuery. Also, RStudio can be configured to have root access in its Docker container.p  pSo finally my question Is there a way to use this backdoor to enable fast datatransfer from BigQuery into an R dataframe in an automated way Or are there other ways to achieve this goalp  pAny help is highly appreciated p  hr  pEditp  pI have loaded the same table into a MySQL database hosted in Google Cloud SQL, this time it took only about 20 seconds to load the same amount of data. So some kind of translation from BigQuery to SQL is an option too.p

Negative 656 pI have been trying to add a remove button so that it removes a selected row in my tableview. My problem is slightly different from those i have found elsewhere. My problem lies behind the fact that in my application i have used 1 FXML file as the basis of several different interfaces. When i initialize 1 of these and use the functionality of the remove button it removes the tableView rows fine and how it is supposed to. But when i initialize a second interface still using the same FXML and henceforth same variable names it only lets me delete items in the 2nd tableView and not in the first.

Negative 656 pI am using XCode 6.3.2 with compiler Apple LLVM 6.1 for a C project and I am facing the following problemp  pWhen I modify an header file, the .cpp files that codeincludecode that header are not recompiled. As a consequence, if only the .h file has been modified, nothing is recompiled and the old version of the code is run.p  pI can of course clean the entire build ShiftCmdK before compiling but this rather annoying. Is this an expected behavior If not, there is a way to force XCode recompile the implementation files that are dependent on a header file if the latter is modifiedp

Negative 656 pI am trying to find a solution to a very difficult task strongproperly version controlling Wordpressstrong. p  pWordpress allows alot of simplicity by allowing users to update wordpress core file, themes and plugins by simply clicking a button. But what happens when you have that website under version control with something like git As soon as we click that Update Now button, our git repo will be out of sync and therefore defeats the purpose of creating a git repo in the first place. p  pI have been looking into ways to get around this issue and all I was able to find was different ways to structure the Wordpress installation by breaking up components into git submodules. One of the most popular example is the a hrefhttpsgithub.commarkjaquithWordPressSkeleton relnofollowWordpressSkeletona template. p  pAlthough this work to version control each module  component of wordpress, it still does not allow the user to be able to use the automaticupdates button from within Wordpress as that will update the files in production but not commit those changes into your git repo. p  pIn an ideal world, we should be able to version control all the files in one repository and then when we click the Update Now button, it should update our git repo with the modifications automatically. Does anyone know how this can be accomplished p  pOne of the things I was thinking was to create a plugin that would listen for update events and autocommit changes as soon as that hook is triggered. Not sure if this is the best approach. p  pPlease let me know if anyone has a better way I can accomplish this. p

To deal with this I tried adding prevent default and then ended up using return false.p  pThis was great...until I realised that when I was testing typing into input field text boxes I had taken away my ability to put a space whilst typing.p  pWhat I think I need is eitherp  ul liTo undo the prevent default or return false somehow after Ive finished using it although I couldnt figure out how to do this because I needed this function to be available on the whole page.li liStop the spacebar from making the page scroll down when held but still keep its ability to add spaces when typing text.li ul  pReally not sure how to do this.p  pHere is the code I am using for this example  p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classmoogtI am mooltdivgt     ltinputgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode.container       height9000px     .moo      border1px solid black  .red      backgroundred  input      margintop30px  codepre  pSCRIPTp  precodedocument.keydownfunctione      ife.keyCode  32          .moo.addClassred         event.preventDefault         event.stopPropagation         return false          else          .moo.removeClassmoo       document.keyupfunctione      ife.keyCode  32          .moo.removeClassred         event.stopPropagation       codepre  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netsusannalarsen43txyhmf relnofollowDEMO HEREap

Negative 656 pWhen you drag column headings to reorder them in Windows Explorer or drag tabs in Chrome you get a nice animation where the other header buttons shift around to make space.p  pIm trying to replicate that in a header control Im writing.

Negative 656 pI need to read binary data structures as they are flushed to a file in Windows. I dont have control over the program that writes the data, its a blackbox LP model that always writes to a few hardcoded filenames, but I do know it flushes its output periodically. I would like to read this data as its written, from several files at once. I dont have a problem forking a thread for each file, but it would be really convenient if I could use readn and have it block until it reads an ementireem n bytes, or readintod and have it block until the buffer is full. Is this possible to do in Python on Windowsp  pIm having a tough time searching for this because all anyone ever talks about is nonblocking and how to do it.

Negative 656 pHi so I have a protocol called codeDTNavigationControllerDataSourcecode which is defined as leaving out the methodsp  precodeprotocol DTNavigationControllerDataSource NSObjectProtocol codepre  pThen, in my own custom codeUINavigationControllercode subclass I have an instance variable of this protocol as follows.p  precodevar dataSource DTNavigationControllerDataSource codepre  pBasically I need to know when an object becomes the dataSource. i.e The codedataSourcecode property is set. So I can call the dataSource when it is initially set, to setup some state. Ive thought about using KVO however codeNSObjectProtocolcode doesnt define any methods for doing so. Im not sure if this is even possible or if there is an alternative way outside of using KVO to know when the dataSource property inside codeDTNavigationControllercode is set. Ive also tried codedidSetcode and codewillSetcode but Xcode threw errors at me, as I think that is only available for primitives.p

Negative 656 pThere is a screen where the client makes a service call to list the shopping bags of a customer. Then the user can press on each shopping bag to see what is inside. However I want to implement a filtering so that I can show what is inside each shopping bag.

Then the service call would return all the product types within selected date from all shopping bags. What would be the optimum way to implement this assuming 1000s of users might want to carry out such a filtering at once.p

Negative 656 pI am currently creating an Android events app that uses RxJava to wrap an old network layer and cache setup with Observable.create. Im currently stumped as how to approach prefetching data though. Initially I display a list of events which will then open an EventDetail Activity which will fetch the contents of the given event. I want to prefetch some of events contents, but end up making redundant network calls if the event is selected before the prefetch returns and caches. Is there a good way to keep Observablessubscriptions alive over Activity switches A singleton network layer held in the application Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 656 pIt been while since I began studying android development. I am able to make small apps. I have two questionsbr 1.
