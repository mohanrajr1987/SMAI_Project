Id like to calculate the average, max, and min of all the quizes.Id like to create a function for each computation, but I dont know how to pass a particular field of the struct to a given function. here is what I havep  pThe structp  precode struct studentData          char name[30]         int quiz1 int quiz2         int quiz3 int quiz4         int mid1 int mid2         int finalexam       codepre  pthe average functionp  precodedouble calcFAveragestruct studentData record, int reccount      float  sumF,Favg     int k              calculate the score sums             for k0 kltreccount k                              sumF  record[k].finalexam                          Favg  sumFreccount      return Favg     codepre  pin the mainp  precodestruct studentData record[100] calcFAveragerecord,reccount codepre  pThe codereccountcode variable holds the number of records for the struct.

Right now I have an average function for each field which is really a bad way of doing it I think.p
Positive 5569 pI have a program that uses Python tkinter to make radio buttons. I have 3 different variables , and each variable can be selected by selecting one out of many inputs which are specific to each variable meaning there are like 5 inputs per variable, for examplep  pfor examplep  precoderadio1  Radiobuttonsomeframe, textsomevalue, value1, variablethismyvar radio2  Radiobuttonsomeframe, textsomevalue2, value2, variablethismyvar radio3  Radiobuttonsomeframe, textsomevalue3, value3, variablethismyvar codepre  pThen repeat this 2 more times for variablethismyvar2 and variablethismyvar3. p  pI then have a function that will submit the variable values into a form.

Positive 5569 pImagine you have a function in MATLAB of two variables, codefx,ycode. And it was written in a way that codexcode can be a scalar or a 1D array, but codeycode is strictly meant to be a scalar. For an array codexcode the function returns the array of elements of the same length as codexcode.p  pNext, you need to refactor this function to accept both codexcode and codeycode to be 1D arrays of equal length, the value of a function codef[x1,x1],[y1,y2]  [fx1,y1, fx2,y2]code.p  pHow would you do this in the most efficient wayp

Negative 5569 pIm trying hard to find out how to use the file chooser button properly. Reading the reference manual on GtkFileChooserButton, GtkFileChooserDialog and GtkFileChooser didnt help so far. Ive tried connecting to the undocumented signal emfilesetem of GtkFileChooserButton and calling getfilename from here, but it seems to behave quite unreliably. When the user clicks the button and selects a file, it works fine so far.p  pBut, if after clicking on the same button which already has a filename set, the user changes his mind and closes the open file dialog, getfilename returns None a Python type, i write it using pygtk while the file remains set. Even more weird, if i call getfilename on that button later from within another signal handler, the filename returns to what it previously had been set by the user. By the way, only closing the dialog box seems to cause the problem, pressing cancel works just fine.p

Negative 5569 pIs anyone aware of a way to make visual studio completely ignore a file when compiling  I have a C solution that has a foo.config file that isnt really a standard config file  its just a text file.  During compiling VS grabs a hold of the file and bombs.  p  pId like for it to act as though its just a text file.  I do not have the option of changing the name of the file.p  pEDIT Please note that BuildAction does not exclude files from the compiler checking them.  It simply decides if the file is compiled into the assembly, whether its content like a jpg or something, or whether it is a resource file.  For more info a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary0c6xyb6628VS.8029.aspxsee the MSDN pagea.p  pEDIT2 Apparently, if you have a text file that is named foo.config and you have it open while building, VS2005 will pop up an error thinking that the file should be xml.  However, if you close the file, VS2005 will ignore it.p  pSolution Visual Studio validation causes errors if you have a noncompliant file open during build time.  For an example of how to turn this off for HTML, see a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20051123431350.aspxScott Guthries posta.  As Allen mentioned, you should also have the Build Action turned to None.  Unfortunately, this will not stop build errors if you have the file open.p

The lists need not have any common elements at all, and one or both may be empty.  [emClarification You may assume no repetitions of elements.em]p  pThe problem is to produce a sort of diff of the lists, which may be viewed as new list of ordered pairs codex,ycode where codexcode is from codeLcode and codeycode is from codeRcode, with the following propertiesp  ol liIf codexcode appears in both lists, then codex,xcode appears in the result.li liIf codexcode appears in codeLcode, but not in codeRcode, then codex,NULLcode appears in the result.li liIf codeycode appears in codeRcode, but not in codeLcode, then codeNULL,ycode appears in the result.li ol  pand finallyp  ul liThe result list has the same ordering as each of the input lists it shares, roughly speaking, the same ordering property as above with each of the lists individually see example.li ul  h1Examplesh1  precodeL  d R  a,b,c Result  NULL,d, a,NULL, b,NULL, c,NULL  L  a,b,c,d,e   R  b,q,c,d,g,e Result  a,NULL, b,b, NULL,q, c,c, d,d, NULL,g, e,e codepre  pDoes anyone have any good algorithms to solve this  What is the complexityp

Negative 5569 pFor example, I only want 3 records of a certain branch or item.p  pThank you very muchp  pUpdate Thanks for you guys answer. Maybe it is not a good question. I have one framework repo and several projects referencing the framework. I usually keep working on one project and sometimes I need to update the framework. However, I dont want to affect any other projects because of my updates of framework, although I may not have time to update each project agains the framework changes. So the solution I considered was to chech in the framework .dlls in each projects so that every projects can cache a version of dlls and they wont break. However, I dont want my svn to keep a lot of dll checkins, so I come up with the above question..... I just thought I should probably keep a copy of framework source code in each project instead of dlls. Once I decided to use updated framework, I can do a merge to each projects copy of framework. That sounds better.p

Negative 5569 pI work on an app that gets distributed via a single installer containing multiple localizations.  The build process includes a script that updates the .ism string table with translations for each supported language.p  pThis works fine for languages like French and German.  But when testing the installer in, i.e. Japanese, the text shows up as a series of squares.  Its unlikely to be a font problem, since the InstallShieldsupplied strings show up fine only the string table entries are mangled.  So the problem seems to be that the strings are in the wrong encoding.p  pThe .ism is in XML format, with UTF8 declared as its encoding, so I assumed the strings needed to be UTF8 encoded as well.  Do they actually need to use the encoding of the target platform  Is there any concern, then, about targets having different encodings, i.e. Chinese systems using one GBencoding versus another  What is the right thing to do herep  pEdit Using InstallShield 2009, since there is apparently a difference between that and 2010.p

Negative 5569 pThis is more of a design question and my main intention to post here is to get diverse inputs on the problems solution.p  pWhat I want to create is a counter. A counter maybe single valued single char  digit or multivalued. So Ive designed an hierarchy like this read Key  Counter p  precode                              Key                                                                                           SingleValueKey    MultiValueKey   NumericKey   AlphaNumericKey   there could be further mix and match between these types codepre  pNow while designing the MultiValueKey, I thought I could simply use a collection of nSingleValueKey to create a ncharacter counter. For e.g. a 2 digit multivalue counter will use an array of size 2 of SingleValue Numeric counters. What Im eventually planning is a variable length alphanumeric key set, base 64, for short urls. The numeric context is just a simple example.p  pWhat Im stuck at now is the rolling or wrapping of lower order counters into incrementing higher order counters. Foe e.g. for a 2 digit counter, once the units place reaches 9, the next number will be when the units places wraps around to 0 and the tens place is incremented by 1.p  pI have a few areas I need your feedback on how this should be done  p  ol liThe single value counters should throw an exception when its reached its max value Or should it automatically wrap around Or should it allow the user to specify which of these approaches should be taken li liIn case the single counter should throw an exception as I think, there should be a reset method to reset the counter to the start  the caller should handle the exception and call reset before  after it goes on to increment higher order counters. Would this be a good designli liWhen the counter is just initialized  new SingleValueNumericKey  what should be the value of the counter Should it be ready to use, with no value, OR should it be the first value in its value setli liSimilar to the prev question, when the reset method has been called, what should be the value of the counter li ol  pPlease help me with your valuable inputs here. If you have suggestions on the design itself, its more than welcome If I take away something from this thread, Im going to refer to it in my commits  so you will have the credit for the suggestion p  pThanks, br Madhur Tanwanip  pEDIT Added my final use case to clarify Jasons questions for all.p

Using cURL alone no NuSOAP I was able to access the WSDL file and find out the server is redirecting to a different endpoint location ...EWSServices.wsdl.p  pUnfortunately, Ive tried using the NuSOAP librarys cURL ability and setting the same options through NuSOAP, and I am still getting the same generic error message as if NuSOAP is just unable to seeviewaccess the WSDL file. I believe it may still be NTLM Authentication as the cURL version takes a few moments to return NTLM it a multistep handshake process, whereas the NuSOAP client code is immediately returning the error message.p
Negative 5569 pThere have been many situation where I need to have a resizable area. It seems that using a grid and a gridsplitter to resize the columns is a good idea.

Negative 5569 pHey guys.  Im designing a site that uses the Icefaces framework.  Ive been reading a book called Real World Java EE patterns.  Im kind of confused how to layout the pages.  Normally I would have just a POJO class implement serializable for a bean.  This bean would then back each page.  With a single page design Im going to have a bunch of elements on the page.  Datatables, trees, inputs, calendars etc.  Is it normal or best practice to have separate beans for each datatable, calendar, etc or put that all in one bean  Im not sure how to approach this.  Right now each element is a bean and Im using the Inject annotation to have the data table talk to the tree and vise versa.  This creates really bad code and if I put this as a member of the class I will get a circular reference because the data table bean has to inject the calendar and the calendar has to inject the data table.  p  pThanks for any help.p

It was just defined by the user and now he can create content based on this data structure.

It would be pretty neat to define the data structure of an object in a codeyamlcode or codeinicode file and then scaffold its database table, model and CRUD.

Negative 5569 pIve been studying a little about garbage collection, mostly applied to serverside  realtime applications, and Ive started to sketch an algorithm with which it would be possible to have an asynchronous garbage collection system. Since Im starting on this topic now, so I dont know very deeply about gc algorithms, I was wondering about the possible pitfalls of an implementation like that. The algorithm is very crude, and with many undefined parts.p  pHeres how I thought about itp  ul lieach thread has its own heap space to manage, and stores a list of pointers it owns that are in use by other threads With that, garbage collection works totally asynchronous to the running threads, andli liphase 1 start following the threads roots and marking all objects reacheable by them. If we get into another threads space, we stop following this pointer, and mark this pointer as in use on the owner threadli liafter we have marked all regions, we select a region maybe with most dead references as possible, and start copying its live object references to another space. it might be the whole thread heap space, but I think it could be too memoryintensive this operationli licopying starts with setting with CAS a flag which states that the object is being copied. Any mutable action to be performed on this particular object while that flag is set will spin lock until a new address is set by the gc thread. When copying finishes, a new address is set on the old one, and any mutable reference to be performed on the object will be routed to the new objectli liafter updating all references made to those pointers using CAS, the old space is finally freed no new pointers will be updated with the wrong address, since every mutator will first check to see if the reference has changed locationsli ul  pThats itp  pAnyway, Im quite excited with a possible implementation that doesnt stopstheworld, and using only fast spinlocks that apply only to the object being copied. But Id like to know if this is possible to implement, or if there is any possibility of having a dangling pointer somewhere, or memory leaks, or it its inneficient, etc. Any info that will contribute to this will be greatly appreciated p  pIm not at all too sure about how e.g. it would handle circular references from different threads. I think this would be handled naturally since we update all hazard pointers the current gced thread has. There might also be some kind of concurrent access I wasnt considering.p  pThank youp  p EDIT Thanks to Ernests contribution, Im thinking about not using a copying algorithm, but maybe a simple mark amp sweep. Thats because wed need to check every time we access an objects variable if the pointer has been updated. This seems to me a quite big overhead. Doesnt itp

Negative 5569 pSuppose I use a lock hierarchy to avoid deadlock. If I use readerwriter mutexes, how should I think about and use these Do there exist can I think of a distinct reading lock and writing lock in the hierarchy for each readerwriter mutex If yes, this would imply that these two locks could be assigned different levels in the hierarchy. Does using readerwrite mutexes introduce possibilities of deadlock into the hierarchy If yes, how if at all can that be avoided What about upgradeable locks reader locks which can be turned into writer locks without unlocking the mutex firstp  pYes, Ive seen advice to avoid specifically readerwriter mutexes if possible. This is not about whether to use them generally just assume that there existed a problem best solved by readerwriter mutexes. Similarly, do not suggest alternatives to the lock hierarchy just because youd generally favour them. If however combining readerwriter mutexes with lock hierarchies does introduce a possibility of deadlocks, feel free to suggest alterations to the used concepts.p  pIt might be helpful to know that Im thinking about multithreaded programs using the Boost Thread library. The readerwriter mutex class is called sharedmutex there uniquelock is an exclusive writer lock sharedlock is a shared reader lock upgradelock is a reader lock that can temporarily be upgraded to a writer lock.p

Negative 5569 pI am building an Webpage that uses SVG, Canvas and, of course, HTML. The idea of this page is to animate the redrawing of some of svgpaths on the canvas. The paths I like to redraw are annotated with an namespace Attribute, all other paths are just displayed as they are. That is all working fine The performance leak appeared the last two hours while I was adding some content to the page. But at first a little illustration of the page setup img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRvXd7.png altdecription of the page setupp  pThe SVG and the Canvas are both 4000  4000 px wide and lie directly over each other in one container div. Going from one page to another means to tween the upper left edge of this container. This was also working fine since the discussion of inserting text turned in the direction of using html div container, instead of the svg itself. So i inserted a third container div in which all the texts are stored and after svg is loaded they are positioned absolutly. With every div I added the pantween and even the drawing performance decreased to a Point that is just too low. I am searching for way to bring the performance back to a level that is acceptable for the user. One of my ideas is to set text divs to display  none, or visibility  hidden, as long as they are not displayed actually. Another option is to tween only svg and canvas, after this is finished placing the textdivcontainer in one step. But I am currently not sure which solution is better, or if there isnt something much better. So if anybody has an Idea, please let me know.p  pThanks for reading Greetings Philipp  p

But the actual behaviour is even weirder I never see an xhr request go out at all And theres no javascript error It just fails, silently. If I change the url to https, or to a relative path, it works fine, no problem. My question is, why wasnt it TRYING to send out the request before And why didnt it raise an errorp

Im modifying a jquery iframe ajax transport to work without requiring a textarea in the iframe to hold the content when the content isnt html. For the most part it works fine without a textarea, however it ends up mangling any special html characters when you retrieve that text using .innerHTML. One way to avoid the mangling is to get the text using .nodeValue, however that doesnt work when you come across an html element. If you return json that contains an html string for whatever reason, it needs to be able to extract that json string exactly as it was returned within the iframe, meaning leaving all characters intact.p  pFor the purpose of testing, this jsfiddle is enough of a test.

Negative 5569 pIm sure this is another XSLT question with a fairly simple solution but again I havent seen any helpful thread around the net on the topic that I have been able to use. I have an XSLT form containing a bunch of select fields that I need to set to show the data contained within XML from our database, when a query is sent. I am currently using small example codes for the XML and XSL testing. The test XML is as follows p  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltxmlstylesheet typetextxsl hreftest2.xslgt ltrootgt ltradiobuttonsgt     ltradio1gtYltradio1gt     ltblurbgtblahblahblahltblurbgt     lthiddengtNlthiddengt     ltcheck1gtYltcheck1gt     ltselect1gt3ltselect1gt ltradiobuttonsgt ltrootgt codepre  pBelow is the XSLT I am using with this XML. I have set up both the checkboxes and the radio buttons to check themselves dependant upon the data within the XML using xslif commands. The test hidden div also displays dependant on XML data using the same xslif. The input field just displays the XML data it is targeted at.p  precodeltxslstylesheet version1.0 xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransformgt     ltxsloutput methodhtml indentyes omitxmldeclarationno             encodingUTF8gt ltxsltemplate matchgt ltHTMLgt ltBODYgt ltformgt ltxslapplytemplates selectrootgt ltformgt ltBODYgt ltHTMLgt ltxsltemplategt  ltxsltemplate matchrootgt  ltinput typeradio nameradio1 valueY gt ltxslif testradiobuttonsradio1Ygt ltxslattribute namecheckedgtcheckedltxslattributegtltxslifgt ltinputgtRadio Button 1  ltinput typeradio nameradio1 valueN gt ltxslif testradiobuttonsradio1Ngt ltxslattribute namecheckedgtcheckedltxslattributegtltxslifgt ltinputgtRadio Button 2  ltdivgt ltxslif testradiobuttonshiddenNgt ltxslattribute namestylegtdisplaynoneltxslattributegtltxslifgt Yaddah Yaddah Yaddah ltdivgt  ltinput typecheckbox namecheck1 valueYgt ltxslif testradiobuttonscheck1Ygt ltxslattribute namecheckedgtcheckedltxslattributegtltxslifgt ltinputgtCheckbox test  ltlabel forselect1gtselect1ltlabelgt ltselect idselect1 gtltxslvalueof selectradiobuttonsselect1gtltxslvalueofgt   ltoption value1gt1ltoptiongt  ltoption value2gt2ltoptiongt  ltoption value3gt3ltoptiongt  ltoption value4gt4ltoptiongt   ltselectgt   ltbrgtltbrgt  ltbrgt ltinput nameblurb typetext idblurb value.radiobuttonsblurbgtltinputgt ltxsltemplategt ltxslstylesheetgt codepre  pHowever I dont think I can make a select field function correctly using xslif because it is Boolean. I think I could probably write an xslif command for every option which would produce the desired result, however that seems like a very ham handed method of making this work and Im sure there must be a much more elegant solution to this. I also havent had any success making it work using the value method for the input field. p  pFrom the example codes above I would like the select field to show the 3rd option as noted in the XML. Can anyone suggest, or even better give me an example of, how I could code a select field into my XSLT that will behave in the manner described above Any help would be really gratefully receivedp

Negative 5569 pI am writing a Activity tracker for a grails application.  Objective  To Log Usage Hours and browsed pages so that I can analyse logged in users activity pattern.p  pMy current planned solution  Make two tables, One named activity, second browsedpage Activity table will store userid, jsessionid, datecreated, validtill.  and browsedpage will have activityid and browsedurl. The javascript on every pages will be executed for checking mouse activity every 5 minutes, if it detects mousemove, it will make a ajax request to the conroller and the controller logs accordingly.p  pInitially, validtill will be 5 minutes plus the datecreated, which will be updated to be currenttime  5 minutes, if the activity is detected and ajax request is made.p  pMy question  Is this system reliable performance wise I mean, after every 5 minutes, or new page browsed, update is run on activity table to update validtill time. When the application grows and it starts having millions of records, will those updates hamper the performance Can I get some suggestion what can I do to improve my systemp

Negative 5569 pI have been playing with RowWise, ColumnWise and parameter binding to try to find a way to point to a non sequential array of buffers for a VARCHAR column return.p  pThe return could have 10 chars or 8000. I do not want to allocate 8000 x nRows bytes of memory obviously so I have been playing with ways to to this better.p  pThe first obvious way is to allocate a buffer 8000 bytes long and then once SqlFetchO has returned the column length, allocate the correct size for the return and emcopyem it over. Since copy is expensive, I am trying to avoid this.p  pThe next idea I had was to issue two SELECT statements. The first would bep  precodeSELECT DATALENGTHDescription from SpecialOffer WHERE MinQty gt 0 codepre  pI am not sure how expensive this is, but assuming that no data is actually copied from the database, and the 2 byte length field is just read, this could be fast Before executing the second query I can allocate an array with each member having the exact length.p  pIs there any way to get the exact VARCHAR Column length information before the row is retrieved in SQL Serverp  pAlso, is there any way to use specify an pointer to the buffer pointer ie double dereferencing required by ODBC driver. This would allow me to use RowWise binding and an array of pointers to the buffers for example using the second technique.p

Negative 5569 pIm looking for a way to create a unique hash for images in python and php.p  pI thought about using md5 sums for the original file because they can be generated quickly, but when I update EXIF information sometimes the timezone is off it changes the sum and the hash changes.p  pAre there any other ways I can create a hash for these files that will not change when the EXIF info is updated Efficiency is a concern, as I will be creating hashes for 500k 30MB images.p  pMaybe theres a way to create an md5 hash of the image, excluding the EXIF part I believe its written at the beginning of the file Thanks in advance.

Negative 5569 pIm working on putting together a liquid stylesheet and it works wonderful. One thing that Ive noticed is that my browser window in Chrome wont resize below 400px it just gets stuck there and in FF as I scale down it it just stops at around 400px and then pops a horizontal scroll bar.p  pWhen I open the site on my phone it looks perfect at around 320px, so I know it does scale lower than 400px. p  pI was curious if anyone knew if this was a browserdesktop thing or if I should be looking at something other than my CSS. I dont have any minwidth declarations so im not sure what could be causing this.p  pAgain on desktop it scales down to a minwidth of about 400px and stops, but when I open it up on my phone it scales to the size of the phone screen which is roughly 320px... curious why at the very least it wont scale down to the 320px on desktop.p  pedit Also Im not sure if this matters but Opera allows it to scale down to pretty much nothing... So it works with Opera and not in Chrome or FF... any ideasp
Negative 5569 pbr This is the first time that I approach the push notification service and Im little bit confused. I d like to have just some conceptual help, not code.br I need to build an app that should receive and register for different kind of notifications. For instance in my app Id like that users could register for PROMO notifications category and NEWS notifications category, Id like that they could choose which one they want to be notified.br Reading the Apple doc, that was not so clear to me, it seems that once the app device is registered I receive just one token and seems impossible to receive more tokens for different kind of registrationNEWS and PROMO for instance, because the token is related to the app and the device. Is that correctbr The other thing that is not so clear to me is, if a device is registered for a specific notification is it possible to send the notification only to a set o devicesbrbr If nothing of that is offered by Apple Push services do you think that is possible to manage everything like that I register the app device for notification if PROMO  NEWS are selected I get the token I send the token to my server giving also as additional info about the service which the user wants to subscribe The server provider register the token and the kind of subscription PROMO  NEWS Later when I have a notification to push I ask the server all the tokens registered for that specific category and then I send the notification only to those devices registered for that category.p  pbr Thanks for helping me out Im really confused.p

Negative 5569 pQuestion emdoes operand order make any difference when evaluating equality or identity in JavaScriptemp  pIn code, is code0  valuecode faster or more correct than codevalue  0code Note that this question is equally valid for the identity operator, codecode.p  pSince both the equality and identity operators are commutative, I dont believe the operand order  should make a difference in evaluation performance, unless theres some inherent benefit to the leftside literal in the computation of the equality algorithm itself. The only reason I wonder is that I recently used Googles a hrefhttpclosurecompiler.appspot.comClosure Compilera to boil down some JavaScript, and noticed thatp  pcodeif array.length  0 ampamp typeof length  number codep  phad been compiled top  pcodeif0  b.length ampamp number  typeof c code.p  pIn both equality expressionsone loose and one strictClosure has reversed the order of my operands, placing a Number literal and a String literal on the lefthand sides of their respective expressions.p  pThis made me curious.p  pI read through the emEquality Operatorsem section of the a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgpublicationsfilesECMASTEcma262.pdfECMAScript 5.1 Language Specificationa section 11.9, pp. 8082 and found that while the equality algorithms start by examining the lefthand operands first, theres no indication that its faster or better to use a literal as that operand.p  pIs there something about ECMAScripts typechecking that makes examination of literals optimal Could it be some optimization quirk in the Closure compiler Or perhaps an implementation detail in an older version of ECMAScripts equality algorithm which has been nullified in this newer version of the specp

Negative 5569 pI have probably a simple problem to solve but I dont know whats the right approach on that.p  pI have a codediv.notificationcode bar on top of my website that is hidden by default. The bar does get an additional class of either codesuccesscode or codewarningcode that sets it to codedisplayblockcode if needed.p  pSo, there are two cases. Either an output message is rendered directly to the code.notificationcode bar on pageload and it gets a class of codesuccesscode or codewarningcode right with it OR the code.notifcationcode bar is sliding down from top and is fed with json data.p  pAny way, the notification bar should always be visible for 10 seconds and than slide back up.p  pTherefore I wrote two functions that handle this bar.p  precodevar timing  10000 function notificationOutputtype, message      var note  .notification     note.hide     note.find.message.htmlmessage     note.stoptrue,true.slideDown.delaytiming.slideUp   function notificationSlideUpslideUp      var note  .notification      if  slideUp  note.delaytiming.slideUp         else note.stoptrue,true.slideUp  codepre  pSo the codenotificationOutputcode function is triggered from various other functions that return json data and render that into the box. p  pAnd the codenotificationSlideUpcode function is right now called on every page load because in my header I have this p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction         notificationSlideUptrue      ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd there is a reason for that Remember the case where the code.notificationcode is directly set to visible on pageload e.g. when a user logsin on my platform the code.notificationcode bar is immediately visibile and says Welcome Username, youve successfully logged in.p  pI call the codenotifictaionSlideUpcode function in my header to make sure the currently visible code.notificationcode bar will slideUp again after 10 seconds.p  pstrongAnd here occurs the problem strong Somehow this causes the entire notifcation timing and sliding up and down to be confused. So there must happen some queuing of the slidefunctions and or of the delay function, because without the codenote.stoptrue,truecode in the codenotificationOutputcode function the notification wouldnt slideDown immediately if its triggered within the first 10 seconds after the page load. That is because the codenotificationSlideUpcode function has already triggered the slideUp and the delay of the object.p  pAnd the same happens to the delay. If a code.notificationcode is put out within the first 10 seconds the delay timing isnt right because the delay counter already started on pageload.p  pAny idea how to solve that so that it always worksp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  precodevar notificationTimer  function notificationOutputtype, message      var note  .notification     note.hide     note.find.message.htmlmessage      note.stoptrue,true.slideDown      clearTimeoutnotificationTimer     notificationTimer  setTimeoutfunction          note.stoptrue,true.slideUp     , 10000    function notificationSlideUpslideUp      var note  .notification      if  slideUp           clearTimeoutnotificationTimer         notificationTimer  setTimeoutfunction              note.stoptrue,true.slideUp         , 10000      else          note.stoptrue,true.slideUp       codepre

Negative 5569 pIm currently working on a distributed services architecture for a project at work. Essentially, we are managing upwards of 200 machines. Each of these machines has an instance of a service running on them that allows us to interface with the machine in a specific way.p  pAt the center I have a control application which needs to talk to these 200 identical services. I was hoping to use RMI via Spring Remoting to make this happen, allowing me to Autowire my remote service into my Controller and treat it like a local service with exception propagation and maybe in the future propagation of transactions  security context via hooks.p  pThis works great for a single service on a single machine where I can hardcode the remote service in my Spring configuration, but what Im not able to figure out is how to dynamically choose which service aka, which machine I want to talk to at runtime and make that remote service available the Spring way.p  pI would like to be able to configure this dynamically from a database table and use the same table information to do a service lookup, while still taking advantage of dependency injection.p  pI thought of maybe injecting some kind of service manager that could do a service lookup of some sort, but was hoping someone else has managed to solve this or a similar problem elegantly.p  pAn example of a hardcoded, single service instance would be like sop  pThe first XML snippet is on the machine service itself, telling Spring to expose it via RMIp  precodelt Expose DeviceService via RMI gt ltbean classorg.springframework.remoting.rmi.RmiServiceExportergt     ltproperty nameserviceName valueDeviceService gt     ltproperty nameservice refdeviceService gt     ltproperty nameserviceInterface         valuecom.example.service.DeviceService gt     ltproperty nameregistryPort value1199 gt ltbeangt codepre  pThe second XML snippet is on the client control application which lets me access the exposed servicep  precodelt Proxy our remote DeviceService via RMI gt ltbean idremoteDeviceService classorg.springframework.remoting.rmi.RmiProxyFactoryBeangt     ltproperty nameserviceUrl valuermimachineurl1199DeviceServicegt     ltproperty nameserviceInterface valuecom.example.service.DeviceServicegt ltbeangt codepre  pIts that second bit of configuration that Im trying to make dynamic. As you can see, to create this service proxy, I need to know at bean creation time the service URL. The Service URL can be 1 of 200 variations, depending on what machine I want to talk to. The service Im talking to is the same interface, but I wont know which machine until runtime depending on the current request context.p

Negative 5569 pIm having a weird problem saving with Eclipse and MySQL Workbench.  I am using Eclipse Java EE Indigo Service Release 1 and Workbench CE 5.2.24.  My java is version 1.7.001.  I am running on a Windows 764 machine.p  pI have some files on a network drive.  If I edit one in Eclipse and try to save it, I get Save could not be completed with the reason The system cannot find the path specified.  Eclipse can successfully edit other files on the same drive.  Also, another version of Eclipse on a different machine 32 bit Java EE Indigo can edit and save the exact same file that the Eclipse on my laptop cannot save.p  pIf I edit a model using Workbench on the network drive, I can modify the model just fine.  If I try to export the script however, I get the error Could not save file .  Failed to create file .KWLQCW. No such file or directory.  I am trying to overwrite an existing script when I do the export.  Again, using Workbench same version from another machine can make the modification that the Workbench on my laptop fails to.p  pI can edit or change both of these files using other editors with no problem.  In fact, when I change do change them, Eclipse requires me to refresh them, but then cant save after editing them.p  pBoth Eclipse and Workbench work just fine if the files are on my C drive.  All of this was working last week and I cannot think of a configuration change I have made to my machine.  Id be grateful for any advice on debugging this.p

Negative 5569 pI plan to offer my website designs and if someone is interested in an easytomanage blog or just doesnt want to make new html files for new posts on hisher own this simple loginblog system is what I will offer them as an addition. p  pIts main purpose is to enable strongonly onestrong user to log in by providing the password the username cannot be changed and allow himher to edit a few account settings displayed name, avatar, bio or make new pagesposts by just writing new content into the window. This is supposed to be a very simple system with no registration forms  a framework which I want to provide to all clients who would choose to buy my designs.p  pSince the login system is so simple, I dare to say that there is little authentication needed  just the password entry any other forms where the user enters, for example, the content of a new post. So basically, it should have the following functions codetrimcode,codehtmlspecialcharscode,codemysqlstringescapecode, checking for valid characters with a regular expression and a user session strongby the way, is a user session even needed on a site with only one userstrong. What else is needed on such a simple website I was thinking about a selfsigned SSL certificate, however, it causes a security warning.

Everything was working brilliantly on my machine, but when I moved my code to another machine I am getting strange behaviour, which is completely baffling me.

Negative 5569 pFor Linux OS i am developing some kind of learning system. Architecture consists of two main parts, they are generator and parser. Generator is working with help of several slave processes that produce a huge amount of files lets call them raw data. Creating of each file can last hours or milliseconds. Parser is working in another ext. process and must take files that has already fully recorded by generator.  So  the problem is how effective inform parser that certain file is ready for parsing.p  pSo far i see several solutions, they arep  ol lipRename file after done, add extra prefix, for example Dfileoldname. After that parser can get these files via simple list. Drawbacks of this fileoldname must be saved somewhere in memory and plus extra system call on rename. That is crucial because at certain moment the amount of files that generator is creataing can be very large.pli lipChange file permissions after done. Drawbacks  some kind of trick and it likely will produce errors in production system during install, update and support.pli lipUse file locking mechanizm. Drawbacks  can stall parser process.pli ol  pMy question is what is most effective solution  or may be your offer some other solution p

Negative 5569 pI am currently having a very simple problem with capturing the output from a backticked shell command. I apologize that the problem is rather simple. p  pI have some sorted array validruns which I strongknowstrong contains consecutive, duplicate elements. I want to use backticks to echo this array to uniq. I want to capture the STDOUT in an array. I attempt to do so like this.p  precodeuniquevalids  echo validruns  uniq print uniquevalids codepre  pThis print statement yields nothing. For that matter neither does this.p  precodeuniquevalids  echo validruns print uniquevalids codepre  pI know how to use uniq and echo. This seems rather odd to me. I would think this has more to do with perl arrays than proper use of those commands. I have searched around a bit elsewhere, so please dont pelt me with downvotes just because the solution might seem trivial. Thanks again for your time.p  pNOTE on solutions TLPs solution is the most straightforward as far handling the uniq problem. I am being rather flexible, since all responses suggested not making a system call for this problem. If Perls uniq function the same as Unixs uniq then the array ought to remain sorted.p  pJohn Corbetts solution works well if you dont care about a sorted result.p

Negative 5569 pThe answer to this question is probably quite simple  but Im stumped.  p  pI built a slideshow that pulls from this RSS feed a hrefhttpuvmbored.comeventfeedevents relnofollowhttpuvmbored.comeventfeedeventsa and  displays a box for each event, headlined by the Day of the week, Month, and day. Followed by the time of the event and title of the event.  p  pHowever the times were always showing up 4 hours strongBEFOREstrong their time in the RSS feed was set as so a 10pm event was showing up as 6pm. Originally I thought the issue was with the reader I was using to convert the info to HTML  but in checking out the markup in Firefox Ive noticed the same problem. When the browser reads the markup it displays the time incorrectly.  However when you view source and look at the raw markup the times are correct except in 24hr format.p  pSo for examplep  pIn the a hrefhttpuvmbored.comeventfeedevents relnofollowRSS Markupa for Lake Champlain Shipwreck Tours the  is set as Sat, 25 Aug 2012 110000 0000 but Firefox and my slideshow before I took the time out of it is displaying the time as 700AM as opposed to the 1100AM it emshouldem be.p  pAnyone know whats going onp

Negative 5569 pI cant seem to find an almost exact question so I might as well ask away.p  pIs it really a standard practice to send variables from Javascript to PHP Im planning to send array to PHP after some several assessment within Javascript  passing variables here and there...only to be combined again as an array, and as Ive said, will be passed to PHP. Am I missing something I hardly see any tutorials to do this, mostly the other way around  that is, PHP array to Javascript. Makes me think, maybe it just isnt being advised to do Javascript to PHP due to security reasons.p  pSimply put, will sending Javascript array to PHP that will later on be saved to database be dangerous I havent really FULLY read how to do it, just scanned the very few that I could find...json stringify, POST, json encode, json decode. If it is fine to do JS to PHP passing, and since it is related to my question anyway, can someone point me which of those mentioned is best for better security Thanksp

Negative 5569 pAlright, there are 4 instances of a clock inout occuring. Theres a clock in, a clock out for lunch, clock in from lunch, and a final clock out. Its a 24 hour clock, and the time needs to be rounded to the nearest .25 15 minutes at the very end. p  precode   For reference, a is the first clock in hour, b is the clock out for lunch hour     c is the clock in hour from lunch, and d is the final clock out hour     e is the first clock in minute, f is the clock out for lunch minute     g is the clock in from lunch minute, and h is the final clock out minute     So for example, if somebody clocked in at 530, a5 and f30     a clock out for lunch at 1200 gives b12 and g0, etc.     The way this code works in a nutshell is to find the total time elapsed and then     subtract the lunch break time from it.

Negative 5569 pI have a multinode hazelcast cluster.  I need to ensure that when a new value is inserted into a map, only one entrylistenermap store gets invoked.  Unless I am having a brain freeze, hazelcast does not do that by default It would be great if I was wrong about this.  Besides using distributed locks I do not wish to avoid using listenersmap stores on other nodes, are there any other suggestions to ensure that only one listenermap store ends up executing code.  p  pThanksp

Negative 5569 pI am building a webapplication that will be a twitter style onepage app, possibly strongemwithemstrong user authentication. 80 of the interactions happen in the frontend with JavaScript, and with the help of a backend who answers providing data from the db... p  pUntil now my thought was to use Symfony2, plus an MVC framework for the frontend like Backbone or Ember prefer Ember as it seems more documented and in general more organized and easier. p  pWhile I was getting into learning Symfony2, it came to my attention that many of the things that Symfony2 offers are of no use for my app. I dont really need its views as views are going to be templated with Javascript, and I dont really need its routers either as that will be also handled with states with JS on the frontend.. p  pSymfony2 will only be used as a JSONresponding mechanism, I guess doctrine also helps someone whos not primarily a backend guy to do the queries easily, and of course for the Authentication. I guess FORMS are also handled by JavaScript.p  pIve seen lots of other questions regarding Symfony2 and backbone, RESTful, etc. There are many different answers, some say you need a Bundle to create RESTful APIs why  others say you need Bundle for the complete Integration of BackboneSymfony2, others say you just need to query JSON data with Symfony2 and Serialize them and send them back, so nothing special.. p  pSo my question is Seems like Symfony2 is an overkill for this kind of APP. But considering this is an opportunitytolearn project, is it really a problem performancewise, or not playing well with the FrontEnd. And the subquestion to that is, can you provide of any working example on Symfony2 integrated with an onepage webapp Ive seen different elements, but nothing as a whole so I can know what am I trying to achieve codewise.p

Negative 5569 pIm a little confused about the .api file which gets created when using Google Cloud endpoints.  This seems to list all methods and parameters.  It gets auto generated using the Google Plugin for Eclipse or when running endpoints.sh.  The .api file seems to be needed, otherwise a 404 is returned when accessing the API.p  pIf I generate the endpoint class from an Entity class it creates the .api file AND the Endpoint.java file.  My question is if I want to create a custom Endpoint.java file e.g. different parameters, then how do I do this   Am I supposed to update my code then manually modify the .api file, or is there a way to generate just the .api file.p  pOr is Google App Engine saying you can generate the Endpoint with its basic methods and thats all that is possible...  I would have thought that the .api file should be generated based on registered endpoints in web.xml at deployment time or better still just scan for Api annotations at deployment time and build the necessary config then.p  pAlso if youre not using the plugin in Eclipse e.g. youre using Maven some further manual steps are required e.g. updating web.xml.  This is documented in the Generating Client Libraries section of the App Engine website  but this is surely doing more than generating a client library, its creating the necessary deployment config server side too.  I found this confusing.p

Negative 5569 pheres my problemp  p2 angles represented as integer from 0 to 360 or 359 if needed 1 double from 0 to 1, representing the convergence rate.p  pI need to write a function which pulls the angles close together by a factor equal to the convergence rate.p  pFor example, if i have a converge rate of 0.5 and two angles 80 and 40, the output should be a couple of angles 70 and 50 so that they are halfway from the converging angle of 60. Thi is fairly obvious with this configuration but its hard for me to approach the problem in a general case, because im really bad at trigonometry and never worked with angles in my career, so i have no experience. So this function needs to work with any configuration of angles and the problem arise because for example, if the difference is 180, i need to invert the operations because the angles are represented as integers and i must work with sum and subtractionp  pI need to implement it in Scala but feel free to write your suggestion in Java, pseudocode or any other popular language, i hope there wont be issues on translating your code to Scala.p  pThe lighter the solution, the better. p

Negative 5569 pI have a project that contains amongst other things, a Groovy common code module and a separate Grails webapp module.  I made the change from Eclipse to IntelliJ 12.1.2 and it has been a HUGE improvement.  Everything seems to be working much better  for example, when I add fields to a class in the Groovy project, I instantly see them available in the IntelliSense in the Grails project.  Also, another great benefit is that I was finally able to get debugging of the Grails app working in the IDE Hooray for not having to litter the code with print statements everywhere. p  pThe problem that Im having, however, is that it appears that the code that is run when I do a RunRun GrailsFooProj or RunDebug GrailsFooProj is out of sync with the saved code.  For example, I can add a log statement to the code and then try to run it, but it doesnt show up.  Its like its using a cached version of the jarwars. p  pOne thing of note is that for my rundebug configs I had to check the Work offline box of the Maven Settings so that it would not go out to the nexus to pull down jars.  I want it to use the local changes that I have made to the code and not what was published. p  pHow do I get IntelliJ to use the local code changes that I have made when debugging the webapp  I can go to the console and do a codemvn clean installcode on the common code project and it works fine in IntelliJ after that, but I dont want to drop to the console every time I want to debug my app.p

Negative 5569 pI am a college student that was recently interviewed for an internship position. One of the things asked of me was to write a method that took two Strings as input and returned true if the second argument was a substring of the first. The answer I turned in wasnt satisfactory to me, so while I was driving home I thought of the following solution p  precode containsSubstrings1,s2 returns true if the string s2 is contained within s1 public static boolean containsSubstringString s1, String s2       ifs2.length0 ampamp s1null         return true      forint is2.length1ilts1.length1i          ifs2.charAts2.length1  s1.charAti              int ki             forint js2.length jgt0j                         ifs1.charAtk  s2.charAtj1                     j1  exits loop.                 else if j  1                     return true                 else                     k                                 return false  codepre  pThis code basically checks to see if the last character of s2 is equal to the current index of s1 and if so, loops backward through both to see if they match exactly. p  pTwo things I like about this solution are that if s2.length  s1.length, the loop wont execute and the method will just return false and also that it doesnt have to check every character in s1 to find the answer.p  pAre there any improvements I could make in terms of readability, methodology, better programming practices, etc.p

Negative 5569 pIm making a simple developer console for a game Im working on with a friend of mine. Im  working on binding functions to the console, so I have an stdmap containing a string to hold the name well call it by in the console, and my own defined MFP type which is a function pointer that returns a sfString were using SFML and sf is the SFML namespace and takes an sfString as a parameter. All console functions take a sfString and return an sfString.p  pHeres what the code in question looks like is not ALL the codep  precodeinclude ltSFMLSystemString.hppgt using namespace sf  include ltmapgt include ltstringgt using namespace std  class CConsole  public     typedef sfString MFPsfString value    function pointer type      void bindFunctionstring name, MFP func    binds a function     void unbindFunctionstring name    unbinds desired function private     map ltstring, MFPgt functions  codepre  pNow this is all fine and dandy so long as the functions were trying to bind to the console are of the global namespace. But this wont do. Itll be too inefficient to constantly be making global wrapper functions for every single nested function we want to bind to the console.p  pIs it at all possible to make MFP accept function pointers of all namespaces For example, to get the fallowing code to work perfectlyp  precodeinclude console.h    code shown above  Lets also pretend CConsole has an sfStringsfString value method called consoleFunc that returns Hello from the CConsole namespace  sfString globalFuncsfString value       return Hello from the global namespace   int main      CConsole console     consolegtbindFunctionglobal, globalFunc     consolegtbindFunctionCConsole, CConsoleconsoleFunc     return 0  codepre

Negative 5569 pIve been trying to test a bunch of different code to see if this works. I started testing a bunch of simple things, but I ended up resorting to more verbose methods when I saw those didnt work. I believe it will work if I pass the instance of the parent class to the child class, but that can get really messy after firstlevel inheritance and Id definitely prefer to not have to take that route if there are other more efficient alternatives.p  pWhat I have is a function and a variable in the class codeMainParentcode that get inherited by the codeFirstChildcode and codeSecondChildcode classes. Normally, if the variable were to be referenced in the codeFirstChildcode or codeSecondChildcode class, the variable data for both classes would be independent of each other.p  pHowever, what I need it to do is when codeFirstChildcode updates the variable created in the codeMainParentcode class, the changes made by codeFirstChildcode should also be implemented to the variables data inside the codeSecondChildcode class.p  pLike I said, I can easily get it to work if I pass along a variable or instance of the parent class to each child class, but Id like this happen without any parameter passing, because that can get messy after a few levels of inheritance. p  pI can show the code that Ive been working on, but I really dont think that its relevant because Im pretty sure thats just not in the design of PHPs OOP or any OOP that I know of. p  pIs there a simple way to do this that Im overlooking p  pAlso, what about using reference variables I thought about calling an outside function which accepted a reference variable and to just do it that way, but its not a very elegant solution and frankly isnt any simpler than passing an instance of the parent to the child manually.p  pI dont think this is going to be as clean and tidy as I had wanted, but Im really hoping someone will step in and prove me wrong. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5569 pI want to force the preprocessor to do some automatic code generation for me.  I dont need much  just a simple forloop that contains another forloop.[1] p  pIve read all that I can about macro expansion, and no longer giggle when the blue paint comes up.  On a good day I can even explain why one needs multiple layers of macros to generate a function name with token pasting.  Ive actually got the forloop working.  But when it comes to putting a loop within a loop, Im reduced to sprinkling randomly with DEFER, EVAL and OBSTRUCT and hoping for the best.p  pI will not be deterred by calls to reason. I really do want to do this with the standard C preprocessor.  I promise that regardless of outcome, neither I, my employer, nor my heirs will sue you for technological malpractice. I promise I wont allow anyone else to maintain the code, or even view it, without appropriate safety glasses.  Pretend if youd like that Im just asking out of theoretical interest.  Or that my only other option is using M4 for if recursive macros in CPP are kinky, certainly M4 is the whole chicken.  p  pThe best reference material Ive found is a 9yearold Usenet thread  a hrefhttpcomp.std.c.narkive.com5WbJfCofdoublecppexpansion relnofollowhttpcomp.std.c.narkive.com5WbJfCofdoublecppexpansiona p  pIt starts offtopic, is somewhat petty and combative in tone, and is way over my head.

Negative 5569 pLong story short Im working on refactoring an old Android project of mine. Previously, it was using serialization, which was painfully slow and, from what Im reading, a pretty lousy idea in general for Android apps. Im looking for another way to persist both userspecific data as well and readonly data for the application.p  pThere is going to be a good deal of data on both sides and Im not sure if theres a good way to store it. Basically, the app is a small RPG. There are a number of maps that are represented as 2D arrays of Tiles. Each Tile will have a number of attributes, some simple primitives or enums, others additional objects, such as Events, which will also potentially contain various objects, etc. With 400 Tiles in a 20x20 map alone, theres a LOT of data to store. In addition to storing that data, it would need to store a lot of userspecific data, such as which Tiles have been visited, which Events have been successfully run, etc.p  pIve been examining methods of saving this data out and I just cant seem to settle on something. I guess it boils down to XML or JSON vs SQLite. XML or JSON would be more flexible in terms of future changes, which is good as I want flexibility in the data, ie, adding new attributes to existing objects, adding new objects as the need arises, etc. SQLite isnt as easily malleable as you have to change up the schema, perhaps adjust queries and indexes, etc, but I havent really used SQLite in the past, so maybe there are some features that help to simplify that process. However, I would also like fast random access to data to avoid loading everything into memory at once if it can be helped. For example, when moving from one map to another, Id much rather load the next map only when needed rather than having everything held in memory, which is where SQLite would shine as Id be able to directly query the data rather than traversing a JSONXML file to find potentially scattered data, ie, we load the map, but Events and objects contained in the Events may not be unique to that map and could easily lie elsewhere in the file or in another file entirely. However, normalizing the data in SQLite would mean a lot of tables and quite a bit of deconstructingreconstructing of objects.p  pWriting user data would only occur when the user manually saves the game, so write performance is not a big issue.p  pI sometimes have a tendency to overanalyze and get hung up on stuff like this. Maybe neither case is necessarily wrong and Im worrying about things that are infinitesimal. Maybe there are other cases that I havent considered. Ive used Hibernate and have considered something like ORMLite to handle a lot of the database nittygritty, but that would require a lot of retrofitting, likely much more than what I would need to do for other options.p

Negative 5569 pIn my project Im using Angular UIs uirouter for nested views. My layout on a particular record page looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCSFhw.jpg altenter image description herep  pOn first load everything works great, the validation works, the form saves changes to the model etc. The problem arises when you make changes to the form leaving it in an invalid state, then browse to another sub nav link, and then go back again. At this point the previous loaded form had changed the model inherited from the parent view making it invalid, but the new form has loaded with that model believing all its fields to be pristine, and so the form is now in a valid state allowing the user to bypass clientside validation. I cant seem to make the form wake up and validate automatically again unless the user edits a field.p  pOne way I can fix this is to load the model in the nested views controller, so when you click back to the form again from sub nav it loads a fresh model, but I dont feel that this is the right solution especially since on first load both the parent and sub view will both perform a GET for the model.p  pIm a little stuck on this one, any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 5569 pI am dealing with up to N107 x N107 matrices number of nonzero elements is about 6 x N. Those elements are grouped around diagonal. My RAM has 16 Gbt size so I clearly need sparse matrix solver. I run Ubuntu LINUX, and use fortran90 gfortran, or precisely speaking, ratfor90.p  pI have LAPACK, but it doesnt seem to support sparse matrix solving.  am I wrong with that MATLAB must be good, but I dont want to spend much time to get familiar with it the time is pressing. I have oldgold slatec installed and use it for spec. functions does it have sparse matrix routins p  pI hear about ARPACK, but can it be used as a plain solver could it be called from gfortranp  pAny other suggestionp  pThanks,     Alexp

Negative 5569 pHeres the scenariop  pMost of my pages use the CSS from different pages that gets compiled into one big CSS file as per default Rails, no problem there. p  pBut I have a couple of pages that are codeactionscode in a controller which need to use a different CSS page and not the other ones at all. These are just about 3 actions in a controller that otherwise uses the main, default, compiled CSS. p  pIn order to accomplish this, I call a specific layout for the actions that need the separate pagep  precode  format.html  render layout gt doghousetemplate  codepre  pThis codedoghousetemplatecode has this call in it its headp  precode   stylesheetlinktag doghousepage codepre  pThis works fine in Development where pages are compiled on the fly if necessary but in Production, I get the following errorp  precodeActionViewTemplateError doghousepage.css isnt precompiled codepre  pThis is because the codedoghousepage.csscode is strongnotstrong compiled separately, it is compiled into the main application.css file, so of course, it doesnt exist in the codepublicassetscode folder.p  pI should also point out that codedoghouse.csscode is not really a CSS page but rather strongSCSSstrong so I cant just copy it to codepublicassetscode without compilation of some type. p  pMy question is, what is the solution here p  pI cant use the application.css file for these, lets call them doghouse pages, because it messes the styling up and viceversa. p  pIve even tried putting the file into application.rbp  precodeconfig.assets.precompile  w doghousepage.css.scss  codepre  pBut doesnt make a difference. If, on the other hand, I putp  precodeconfig.assets.precompile  w .css  codepre  pI get an error on precompile because of bootstrapaccordion.scss file so I cant do that.p  pIve seen very similar questions here but they tend to apply to using different CSS for a whole controller and nowhere does it specify how not to compile all the pages into one. p  pPlease note that I do strongnotstrong want to separate all the CSS pages that would ostensibly be one solution, just this one separate page. p  pThanks.p

Negative 5569 pWhat Ive read and know about sessions is that they arent really reliable with all that session id hijacking and stuff. So I decided I wont use sessions in my project, Id rather just go with ordinary cookies and hope for the best.p  pSo basically what I have set up is kind of like a session but hopefully will be harder to crack. Unfortunately I seem to be unable to build it hardtocrack. So basically I guess this is more of a security question rather than the choice between cookies or sessions, but I cannot seem to find this in any straight text.p  pWhat am I supposed to hash in the session cookie and how Ive read that hashing algorithms can collide and its just a matter of seconds before an attacker can create a string that would collide, with what is actually in the cookie, when hashed even though it may not be the same. I guess what Im trying to ask is what is the proper way of saving this information in a cookie and actually what information should I store therep  pI know that basically with codehttpOnlycode no attacker should be able to grab a hold of a cookie but I suppose that this project may and probably wont use codeSSLcode so theres the old tapping method available. I know that Im trying to build a skyscraper with sticks and stones here but asking is still worth a shot.p

Negative 5569 pIm trying to add a web setup project for my web services project to make a reasonably complex installation easier for the end user.

Negative 5569 pI hope this is an appropriate question.

Video hosting  for this application, what is the best way to host videos, Is it best to host it on a site like wistia or host it on S3. 2. Youtube is a good option, but Youtube also has the view on youtube option in the player, which redirects the user to youtube, and the link can be shared by the user, since this is a payment model per video, my client fears that the videos may be downloaded without consent or worse, redistributed, causing damage to their IP. 3. What is a good inapp media player for Nokia Asha is there a media player that is crossplatform  4. HTML5 video tag does not work on Asha as of my current test. 5. Should this be a Native Java app or a Web App on Asha, what would you recommend p  pI do not have access to any technical architect who may suggest the mode to take.

Negative 5569 pThe multiple imputation packge codemicecode uses a random number generator which can be set using the codeset.seedcode argument. I am running multiple instances of R i.e. 3 in which the same data are imputed with the same codemicecode arguments, where codeset.seedNAcode which does not specify any seed value.p  pThe three instances of R, however, produce exactly the SAME imputations. I am puzzled by this observation because I thought different instances of R should use different seed values when using codeset.seedNAcode, but it appears they use the same. When I set codeset.seedcode manually, different imputations are produced.p  pMy question is is this plausible or may there be a computer PC windows 7 problem that causes the seeds to be the same, even though I set codeset.seedNAcode. I would welcome any thoughts on this problem.p  pBy the way I use multiple instances of R because the MICE function codeibindcode can be used to combine codemidscode multiply imputed data sets objects. So it saves computing time on systems with multiple cores. This is of course nonsense if the same imputations are produced.p

I dont want to make their own variables and I dont want to create separate lists for each child class.

I thought of IEnumable and Concatting on the new elements, but of course you cant do that when BaseClass is abstract.p  pThe alternative i can think of is using events.

Negative 5569 pI am writing a simple game  Tetris. For the first time in my life Im using functional programming for that goal, as a language I chose Haskell. However, Im tainted with OOP and imperative thinking and scared of unconsciously applying this mindset to my Haskell program.p  pSomewhere in my game, I need to have information about elapsed time Timer and presseddown keys Keyboard. The approach used in SDL lessons translated to Haskell looks like thatp  pMain.hsp  precodedata AppData  AppData      fps  Timer      some other fields       getFPS  MonadState AppData m gt m Timer getFPS  liftM fps get  putFPS  MonadState AppData m gt Timer gt m  putFPS t  modify  s gt s  fps  t   modifyFPSM  MonadState AppData m gt Timer gt m Timer gt m  modifyFPSM act  getFPS gtgt act gtgt putFPS codepre  pTimer.hsp  precodedata Timer  Timer       startTicks  Word32,     pausedTicks  Word32,     paused  Bool,     started  Bool   start  Timer gt IO Timer start timer  SdlTime.getTicks gtgt ticks gt return  timer  startTicksticks, startedTrue,pausedFalse   isStarted  Timer gt Bool isStarted Timer  starteds   s codepre  pAnd then used like that codemodifyFPSM  liftIO . startcode. That makes Timer somewhat pure it is not explicitly a monad, and its functions return IO only because its required to measure time. However, that litters the code outside Timer module with getters and setters.p  pMy approach used in Keyboard.hs isp  precodedata KeyboardState  KeyboardState      keysDown  Set SDLKey,  keys currently down     keysPressed  Set SDLKey  keys pressed since last reset    reset  MonadState KeyboardState m gt m  reset  get gtgt ks gt put kskeysPressed  Data.Set.empty   keyPressed  MonadState KeyboardState m gt SDLKey gt m  keyPressed key  do      ks lt get       let newKeysPressed  Data.Set.insert key  keysPressed ks      let newKeysDown  Data.Set.insert key  keysDown ks      put kskeysPressed  newKeysPressed, keysDown  newKeysDown  keyReleased  MonadState KeyboardState m gt SDLKey gt m  keyReleased key  do      ks lt get       let newKeysDown  Data.Set.delete key  keysDown ks      put kskeysDown  newKeysDown codepre  pThat makes the module selfcontained, but Im afraid that this is my way to express object from OOP in Haskell and ruins the whole point of FP. So my question isp  pWhat is the proper way to do that Or what are the other possibilities to approach such situation And if you notice any other flaws be it design or style problems feel free to point that out. p

Negative 5569 pIm trying to create a cross platform application using MVVMCross and portable class libraries, which interacts with an api and displays some data asynchronously.

I can request my page via jQuery.ajax and my callback works as expected.  However, I do not know how to set things up to handle sessiontimeout or unauthorized access responses.p  pFor example, if a session times out, and I continue to make an Ajax request, Spring Security redirects the call to the login page.  So the response to the ajax request ends up being a login page.  On the client side, I need to be able to know that the user no longer has access to the requested page and take appropriate action  ie redirect the browser to a loginerror page.  The same holds true if the user does not have permissions to access a url.p  pIve found similar posts that relate to how to configure logins via ajax, but am having trouble understanding how to deal with unauthorized requests via ajax.  I presume that in the case of Ajax calls, the server should return a specific Status Code ex 401 unauthorized, etc, and have the JS handle the difference codes, but am not sure wherehow to configure that information.  p  pIve tried looking at the codeAuthenticationFailureHandlercode and codeAuthenticationSuccessHandlercode classes, but they do not seem to even be used in my configuration setting breakpoints in them are not even hit, so Im really at a loss to understand whathowwhere to configure the necessary handlersfiltersetc.p

Negative 5569 pIm sitting in a situation where i have to build a statistics module which can store user related statistical informations.p  pBasically, all thats stored is a event identifier, a datetime object and the amount of times this event has been fired and the id of the object which is being interacted with.p  pIve made similar systems before, but never anything that has to store the amount of informations as this one.p  pMy suggestion would be a simple tabel in the database. etc. statistics containing the following rowsp  ul liid Primary, autoincrementli liamount integerli lievent enum list,click,view,contactli lidatetime datetimeli liobjectid integerli ul  pUsually, this method works fine, enabling me to store statistics about the object in a given timeframe  inserting a new datetime every hour or 15 minutes, so the statistics will update every 15 minute p  pNow, my questions arep  ul liis theres better methods or more optimized    methods of achieving and building a custom statistics module.li lisince this new site will receive massive traffic, how do i go about the paradox that index on object id will cause slower update response timeli liHow do you even achieve live statistics like etc. analytics Is this solely about the server size and processing power Or is there a best practice.li ul  pI hope my questions are understandable, and im looking forward to get wiser on this topic. best regards.

Negative 5569 pI have a UITableViewController in a Storyboard that Im adding as a subview to a lone UIView in a UIViewController, my end goal is to get the UITableView flush up against the status bar so that scrolling goes underneath the status bar not through it with clashes.p  pI have configured the lone UIView to have constraints of 0 on both verticals and horizontals but as demonstrated in the image I believe autolayout is then adding the 20px y offset that I am including in the layout. If I remove the 20px y offset and size the UIView to the whole layout I end up with the clashing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5pB5c.png alt20 offsetp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6AEpn.png altno offsetp

Negative 5569 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pThe issue Im facing is actually related to printing a webpage. The page is almost valid HTML 5 with a few codelttablegtcodes with codecellpaddingcode, and some codeltimggtcodes without codealtcodes etc. I have a print stylesheet that prints nicely in all the browsers we are supposed to support latest Chrome, FF and IE except IE 10.p  pWe have specific requirements about the print layout which is significantly different from the web layout. We cannot use a separate page designed for printing as most of the pages content is generated using lots of inputs from the user within JavaScript. One of our print layout requirements is that the printout be on exactly 3 pages with specific parts on specific pages. Its working in all browsers we are supporting except IE 10.p  pIn IE 10, the print out is 6 pages 3 in all others working with the standard Shrink To Fit setting. Now I could go around writing a separate print stylesheet for IE 10 but that just seems like too much work.p  pWhile playing around with the IE 10 dev tools, I noticed that if I select Quirks Document Mode and then print, it fits nicely in 3 pages. So the simplest solution to my printing problem seems to be to somehow trigger quirks mode in IE 10 but not in IE 11 where it already works.p  pstrongThe actual questionstrongp  pSo the question is, how do I trigger quirks mode in IE 10 without triggering it in IE  10. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryjj67691428vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowThisa MSDN page saysp  blockquote   pIf a page doesnt contain a codeltDOCTYPEgtcode directive, Internet Explorer displays the page in quirks mode by default.p blockquote  pSo I tried doing the following with my doctype declarationp  precodelt[if gt IE 10]gt ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lt[endif]gt codepre  pThat didnt trigger quriks mode in IE 10 for me.

Do I have to capture all the values, or is there a way to just populate the 2nd dropdown without reloading the formp

Negative 5569 pI have two buttons with a custom style in WPF. Right now both buttons are the same color, but I have decided I want to make one button blue. Now my question is do I need to create another style even though the change I want is so simple It seems a little redundant to have to repeat all of the code for one more button just because I want it a different color. p  pWhen I try to override the buttons background color, it removes the applied style from the button. I believe it should be like CSS where you can override an attribute while keeping the others the same, although that isnt the case. I dont need it again so I dont think I need a custom control. Is there any way to simply change the background color without repeating all of the style codep

Negative 5569 pHow could I define trigonometric functions that take arguments in degrees instead of the usual radians, and compute correctly rounded results for these argumentsp  pMultiplying the argument by codeMPI180.0code before passing it to the corresponding function in radians does not work, because codeMPI180.0code is not 180. Section 5.5 of the Handbook of FloatingPoint Arithmetic offers a method to compute the correctly rounded product of the argument by 180, but some arguments will still be such that this product is close to the midpoint between two consecutive representable floats, and then applying even a correctly rounded function in radians can produce the wrong final result.p  pTwo strategies that may work alone or in combination are using higher precision and using the codesinpicode,codecospicode, codetanpicode trigonometric functions from a hrefhttplipforge.enslyon.frfrsdownload.php153crlibm1.0beta3.pdf relnofollowCRlibma, that compute respectively codesinxcode, codecosxcode and codetanxcode.p  pFor the latter strategy, there remains the problem of the division by 180, which is not exact for many arguments.p  pRegarding the higherprecision strategy multiplying the argument by an extendedprecision representation of 180, then applying the extendedprecision function in radians, there may remain a problem with exact cases. The theorem that states that the only rational results of codesincode, codecoscode and codetancode for a rational argument are obtained in code0code only applies to the radian versions. It obviously does not apply to the degree versions, and if for some floatingpoint input x, sindegx is exactly the midpoint between two consecutive representable floatingpoint numbers, then no amount of intermediate precision is enough to guarantee that the final result is correctly rounded.p

For example, in Windows command line, I can do something basic like dir command to see the contents of a directory, but if I do it in C via system command such as p  precodesystemCHDIR CWindowsWindowsSystem32Sysprepampampdir  codepre  pthe directory contents do not get displayed.p  pI am running as builtin administrator and have disabled firewallantivirus on the test computer no network. I have removed inheritance and gave full control to everyone for the specified folder and files and ensured there were no deny entries.p  pI have ran into other potentially similar issues as well. For example, reg query from within system from C works but reg add does not. I removed f and it prompted it to overwrite and I selected yes and it appeared to work but the registry value did not change. If I simply run the batch file it works.p  pThen I tested basic file operations. I tried del command from within system and when it couldnt find the file I thought I should try to not use system methods. I was suggested to try remove andor DeleteFile and both did not work.p  pI created a win32 console empty project for testing. I set release and ran the .exe it created as builtin administrator. Does anyone know why the batch files simply work but I cant get the C code to work p  pPlease help.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 5569 pI am updating a Windows Forms application that was written for Office 2003. It would open Word, populate it with text from the database, create buttons appropriate for the users security roles, and handle button clicks. The old way was with CommandBars. The Word documents created this way were stored as DB Blobs, so they were only ever available via the Forms application. That is the functionality I need, but without CommandBars.p  pNow, we have the Ribbon, Action Panes, VSTO, and OpenXML. I know my way around C, but Im new to all of these technologies.p  pI imagine a solution where I set up a template with the proper buttons on a nice ribbon, and the buttons raise events. If someone just tried to use the template by itself, there would be no data and the events would do nothing. But my Windows Form could create a new document based on the template, populate it with text from the database, hide inappropriate buttons, and handle button click events. Easy peasy.p  pI began by adding a Word 2010 Template project and making a ribbon for it. It looks nice in the debugger. But, I cant create a new document with it from a Console app. Word launches, but the ribbon isnt there. Theres a note in the documentation that If a Microsoft Office Word template has managed code extensions, the project assembly is not called if the template is attached as a global template or loaded from the startup directory of Word. In addition, the document does not recognize the format of a template that is part of an Office solution. I believe this means my template is useless. I cant open Word and make a new document with my template or call the template from another project, so, pointless. p  pAll the MS help has failed me, and mostly leads me in circles. I need some direction. For each piece of the scenario I described, what is the most appropriate modern technology For each technology I need to use, what is the best resource for my situationp

Negative 5569 pI am trying to compute the floatingpoint square root of x using assembly code using the newtonraphson method for first finding the inverse square root 1sqrtx and then multiplying by x to find sqrtx.p  pHowever, I was reading the wikipedia page regarding newtonraphson division and it appears that depending on how you compute Xi1, you will need a different amount of precision in intermediate steps. p  pFrom a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDivisionalgorithmNewton.E2.80.93Raphsondivision relnofollowWikipediaap  blockquote   pFrom a computation point of view the expressions Xi1  Xi    Xi1DXi and Xi1  Xi2DXi are not equivalent. To obtain a   result with a precision of n bits while making use of the second   expression one must compute the product between Xi and 2DXi with   double the required precision 2n bits.

Negative 5569 pIm working on an app which will need to authenticate against multiple OAuth providers, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. etc. Users have to authenticate once and once only and then I want to access every authenticated app and retrieve e.g. the home feed.p  pI am building it in Cordova.  After a lot of Googling, I found out that OAuth2 will be supported on the client side, because it doesnt store a client secret. However, e.g. Twitter is OAuth1, and does not support that.p  pThere are some solutionsp  ul liUse e.g. a hrefhttpwww.oauth.io relnofollowhttpwww.oauth.ioa  Not very keen, because it a costs money and 2 is a maninthemiddle. li liCreate my own man in the  middle, which handles authentication for all my providers I cant find any good guide on the web to create an abstract provider which handles all authentication for HTML5 apps li liDo it client side.

However, it suddenly stopped working, the first call for the requesttoken already fails with a 403.

In order to build the nested hasone relationship, I build an Item in the nestedfields partial so that I can build the hasone Modifier.  This is because rails requires that you explicitly call buildsomething in a hasone relationship usually this is called in the controllers new, but I only want to build once someone has clicked the New Item button. For creating new Invoices, this code works perfectly.  Checking console, I see that the relationship is created and I can verify that the Modifier was created successfully.  p  pHowever, when I go back to edit the invoice, cocoon knows that I already have a modifier, so it calls the partial once to create the necessary fieldsfor my single Modifier.  These fields are empty.  This makes sense though, because as cocoon is rendering that partial, it is building a new Code with a new modifier and setting the fields blank.  I can confirm that is what is occuring because once I have my modifier saved properly, I can go into my partial, remove the two build calls, and view the edit page which properly displays the saved Modifier info just fine.  p  pOf course, now that Ive removed my build calls, the form no longer saves any Modifiers that I create.  So essentially, I need the build calls in there to build new Modifiers, but I cant have them in there if I want to view them.p  pDoes anyone have a solution to this situation  I have found multiple stack overflow questions and none of them resolves this issue.p

Problem is, I need this entity in a controller for validation so making the same database call 2 times is pointless.brbr strongOption 2strongp  precodeModifying QueryUPDATE Account SET passwordpass WHERE usernameusername public void changePasswordParamusernameString username, ParampassString pass codepre  pThis way, only the custom update within Query is executed.brbr I think option 2 is probably better if it comes to performance but option 1 feels more jpalike. Any suggestions appreciated.p

Negative 5569 pI have been researching both the C or Windows API method for creating a codesocketcode, and the .Net method for creating a codesocketcode. My concern is whether the same error codes that are available in Windows sockets are also available in the .Net codeSocketcode class. I have looked at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms74066828VS.8529.aspx relnofollowthis pagea on Windows Sockets Error Codes and also a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.socketerrorvvs.100.aspx relnofollowthis pagea, which describes the error codes for the .Net codeSocketcode class. p  pAfter looking at both of the above pages, it seems that the .Net codeSocketcode class provides just as much in regards to codesocketcode error reporting as the Windows API. I would prefer to use .Net to implement a codeSocketcode due to the fact that I feel it would be easier for me as someone who does not have a wide range of knowledge when it comes to C and network programming. However, this job requires that I be able to report errors of the same granularity as the Windows API.p  pIm trying to be as specific as possible here, but with the information provided, what can you tell me in regards to comparing the two with error codes in mind With my knowledge, I am thinking that the C codeSocketcode class is just as strong in this aspect as the Windows API.p

Negative 5569 p[Note that I asked the wrong question on my first stab at diagnosing this  now corrected.]p  pI have a WPF application with one main window that inherits from Conductor.Collection.OneActive.

This private collection is almost identical to the base.Items collection but not all of the viewmodels are IScreen.p  pEverything works fine and state is maintained when we move from one active item to another. However, there is a bug with the Interaction triggers. When the active item is an IScreen, the triggers fire an extra time per navigation, as if they are being wired up again every time normal triggers do not do this, only the ones from the Interaction library. If the active item is not an IScreen  just inherits from PropertyChangedBase  we do not see this problem, but also we lose the state of the view during navigation.p  pIf you navigate to a view four times, the events will fire four times, five times, five, and so on.p  pThis seems the same a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq2043469981317as this questiona but I cannot use his solution since I do not know what the specific viewmodels are and cannot create public properties for them.p  pMy main window class looks like thisp  precodepublic sealed class MainWindowViewModel  Conductorltobjectgt.Collection.OneActive, IHandleltNavigateToUriMessagegt      public void HandleNavigateToUriMessage message              var ignoredUris  RibbonUri.GetItems.Wheret gt t.SubTabs.Count gt 0.Selectt gt t.Uri          Funcltstring, boolgt isMatch  uri gt uri  message.Uri          if isMatchRibbonUri.BookkeepingBatchView.Uri             GetAndActivateViewModelltBatchPanelViewModelgtmessage                    ...           private T GetAndActivateViewModelltTgtNavigateToUriMessage message where T  class              var vm  GetViewModelltTgtmessage.Uri         ActivateItemvm         return T vm           private object GetViewModelltTgtstring uri where T  class              if viewModelCache.ContainsKeyuri             return viewModelCache[uri]         var vm  viewModelFactory.CreateltTgt         viewModelCache.Adduri, vm         return vm       codepre  pMy MainWindow XAML looks like thisp  precodeltWindow xClassUi.Views.MainWindowView       xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation       xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml       xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006        xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008        dDataContextdDesignInstance TypeviewModelsMainWindowViewModel, IsDesignTimeCreatableFalse       mcIgnorabled       WindowStateMaximized gt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt             ltRowDefinition Height1gt             ltRowDefinitiongt             ltRowDefinition Height1gt             ltRowDefinition Height25gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltContentControl xNameMainRibbon Grid.Row0 Margin0 gt         ltGrid BackgroundFFBBBBBB Grid.Row1 gt         ltContentControl Grid.Row2 xNameActiveItem BackgroundWhite gt         ltGrid  Grid.Row3 BackgroundFFBBBBBBgt         ltContentControl xNameBottomStatusBar Grid.Row4gt     ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pAnd the XAML in the active item view looks like thisp  precodeltDataGrid FocusableTrue FocusVisualStylexNull SelectionModeSingle HeadersVisibilityNone IsReadOnlyTrue GridLinesVisibilityNone AutoGenerateColumnsFalse BackgroundTransparent BorderThickness0  Grid.Row3 Grid.RowSpan2gt             ltiInteraction.Triggersgt                 lteiKeyTrigger KeyLeft FiredOnKeyUp ActiveOnFocusTrue gt                     ltcalActionMessage MethodNameTryCollapseSelectedItemgt                 lteiKeyTriggergt                 lteiKeyTrigger KeyRight FiredOnKeyUp ActiveOnFocusTrue gt                     ltcalActionMessage MethodNameTryExpandSelectedItemgt                 lteiKeyTriggergt             ltiInteraction.Triggersgt  .... codepre

Below are the sample structures of my 3 qml views.p  h1main.qmlh1  precodeNavigationPane      id nav     peekEnabled false   onPopTransitionEnded      console.logPOP PAGE from main     ifpage.objectNamenewProfilePage              I tried to access the function using the homepage id but didnt work       menuScreenPage.reloadView  This doesnt work, shows error unknown symbol menuScreenPage          page.destroy   Page      id mainPage      Container                some code                 onCreationCompleted  Some code and then push to homepage  nav.pushhomePageDefenition.createObject                   codepre  h1homepage.qmlh1  precodePage      id menuScreenPage     objectName menuScreenPage     function reloadView This is the function that is needed to be called on page pop from profile page         some code          Container               some code                Button  a button to push to profile page          idpushButton          horizontalAlignment HorizontalAlignment.Right         verticalAlignment VerticalAlignment.Bottom         onClicked              console.logI was clicked                            nav.pushprofilePageDefinition.createObject                                              codepre  h1profilepage.qmlh1  precodePage       id newProfilePage     objectName newProfilePage     Container               some code                   Button  a button to pop to home page          idpopButton          horizontalAlignment HorizontalAlignment.Right         verticalAlignment VerticalAlignment.Bottom         onClicked              console.logI was clicked                            nav.pop                                                   codepre  pSo is there a way that I can access the function of homepage.qml from main.qml Or is there any other function like onPopTransitionEnded which I can access on homepage.qml itself when I pop from profilepage Please advice.p

Negative 5569 pThis question isnt as philosophical as the title might suggest. Consider the following approach to persistencep  pCommands to perform Operations come in from various Clients. I represent both Operations and Clients as persistent actors. The Clients state is the lastOperationId to pass through. The Operations state is pretty much an FSM of the Operations progress its effectively a Saga, as it then needs to reach out to other systems external to the ActorSystem in order to move through its states.p  pA Reception actor receives the operation command, which contains the client id and operation id. The Reception actor creates or retrieves the Client actor and forwards it the command. The Client actor reads and validates the operation command, persists it, creates an OperationReceived event, updates its own state with the this operation id. Now it needs to create a new Operation actor to manage the new longrunning operation. But here is where I get lost and all the nice examples in the documentation and on the various blogs dont help. Most commentators say that a PersistentActor converts commands to events, and then updates their state. They may also have side effects as long as they are not invoked during replay. So I have two areas of confusionp  ol liIs the creation of an Operation actor in this context equivalent to creating state, or performing a side effect It doesnt seem like a side effect, but at the same time its not changing its own state, but causing a state change in a new child.li liAm I supposed to construct a Command to send to the new Operation actor or will I simply forward it the OperationReceived event li ol  pIf I go with my assumption that creating a child actor is not a side effect, it means I must also create the child when replaying. This in turn would cause the state of the child to be recovered.p  pI hope the underlying question is clear. I feel its a general question, but the best way I can formulate it is by giving a specific example.p  pstrongEditstrong  On reflection, I think that the creation of one persistent actor from another is an act of creating state, albeit outsourced. That means that the event that triggers the creation will trigger that creation on a subsequent replay which will lead to the retrieval of the childs own persisted state. This makes me think that passing the event rather than a wrapping command might be the cleanest thing to do as the same event can be applied to update the state in both parent and child. There should be no need to persist the event as it comes into the child  it has already been persisted in the parent and will replay. p

Negative 5569 pThe problem Im running into is already described at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3750605gettingcreatinganoutlookapplicationinwindows737799453779945GettingCreating an Outlook Application in Windows 7a but I had a very hard time identifying the source of the problem because I happen to be maintaining an old VB6 application at the moment, and the errors that are reported from VB6 applications are not mentioned in that article. Furthermore, Im looking for better solutions.p  pThe problem is that codeCreateObjectOutlook.Applicationcode and codeGetObject,Outlook.Applicationcode are failing with Error 429  ActiveX component cant create object, particularly on Windows 7. The source of the problem turns out to be that if Outlook is already running under a normal user account and an application is running as an administrator not unheard of for old 32bit applications running on Windows 7 wants to access Outlook, the request for an Outlook COM interface hangs for 30 seconds and then fails. It seems to be related to the fact that the requested instance of Outlook and the alreadyrunning instance of Outlook are using different user accounts or privileges.p  pIt would be nice, first of all, if a better error could be reported, and if it could be reported more quickly. Usually the application hangs for 30 seconds before reporting the error. So the first question is, is there any way to detect this condition without waiting 30 secondsp  pNext, is there any way to work around this error so we dont have to care that Outlook might already be running under different credentials when we want to access the Outlook API One thought is turning off UAC so that the old 32bit application is less likely to need to be running as administrator. Is there a better solutionp

We already implemented code to measure the running time of all these algorithms but now we decided that we also want to know how many floating points operations per seconds FLOPS we can perform. Any suggestion of how to measurecount thisp  pHere some background information on the used systemp  precodeprocessor    0 model name   ARMv7 Processor rev 2 v7l Features     swp half thumb fastmult vfp edsp thumbee neon vfpv3 tls vfpd32  CPU implementer  0x41 CPU architecture 7 CPU variant  0x3 CPU part     0xc08 CPU revision     2 codepre  pOur first idea was now to implement a kind of FPO counter which we increment after each floating point operation Arithmetic operations as well as comparison and move operations, but that would mean that we have to insert increment operations all over our code which also slows down the application ... Does anyone know if there is some kind of hardware counter which counts the number of floating point operations or maybe if there exist some kind of performance tool which can be used to monitor our program and measures the number of FPOs. Any suggestions or pointers would be appreciated.p  pHere is the evaluation of the FLOPs for a matrix multiplication by using the counting approach. We first measured the running time than inserted counters for each instruction we were interested in and after that we calculated the number of floating point operations per second. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd1GKJ.png altFloating point operations per second for matrix multiplicationp

Negative 5569 pI want to begin by apologizing for not including any code.  VBScript is completely out of my realm of knowledge and I have been asked to use it for a small program here at work.p  pThe goal  I have been asked to search part of the active directory I am told that it is an OU in our active directory and compare the user that is attempting to login to the computer with the OU.  If that person DOES exist in the specified OU, I need to do something.  If the person DOES NOT exist, I need to do something else.p  pThe specifics  I work at a hospital.  The point of this is to keep nurses from using the laptops designated for the physicians on the floors.  When a nurse badges in to said computer, if the person logging in exists in the Physicians OU which is my OU, then continue with the login, else log the person out which would be to key an F4 in Imprivata.  This being said, we use a program called Imprivata that logs the user in when they swipe their badge.  Imprivata can also perform keystrokes like keying in the users password, clicking buttons, etc.  The Imprivata program allows for code to be written in the background in VBScript, WSH, and I believe JavaScript and then executed when a condition exists a person logging on a computer.  Unfortunately, I know NOTHING about any of these languages.  p  pI have been searching the web and trying different things for a week now with no luck.  In fact, I have even got close to anything working so any help would be greatly appreciated and again I apologize for the lack of code.p

Or introduce a whole new element like they did a lot with HTML5. Something like coderichtextareacodep

The arguments are thus passed between sections of the system via file.p  pI understand that eventlet can be used for the nonblocking IO so that beautiful soup or scrapy can web scrape the info from a lot of sites simultaneously sort of and the multiprocessing library can enable the machine learning  quant algorithms to do the calculations on all the stock data in parallel as separate processes. p  pTo view the predictions, the users would log on to the other part of the system built with Flask which would access the database and display the predictions.p  pI presume that all these libraries and mixed threadsmultiprocessing routines get along with each other Im going to use pythonanywhere.com as the host, and they appear to have quite a few batteries included.

Negative 5569 pI am working on a realtime Linux application which appears to have a priority inversion problem high priority processes are starving when a low priority process starts doing a lot of processing. If I schedule the low priority process as non realtime, then the problem disappears if only this was a sufficient solution.p  pI am using pipes for communication, with processes using codeselectcode to check when data is available. Is this the correct way to do IPC in rtLinux If not, what is I stumbled upon a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman7mqoverview.7.html relnofollowPOSIX message queuesa, and named pipes...p  pI am using the 3.14 kernel with the PREEMPTRT patch.p
Negative 5569 pSo I started yesterday with Android studio. I have a little experience with Java as well and mainly wanted to google my way through the programm I want to write. I stumbled multiple times over stackoverflow and all of the people here really helped me out  so thanks to all of you first of all p  pNow to my actual problem I want to write an app that basically converts data from this website a hrefhttpvplanapp.emabonn.deonline relnofollowhttpvplanapp.emabonn.deonlineap  pI already managed to extract all the needed information and everything else I need working in the background. The thing is, that I am now stuck with the UI, which will be constantly changing, because the website is being dynamically updated.p  pAnyway, Android Studio keeps informing me of multiple errors, mainly because of the layouts. I was trying to fix them all, over about 4 hours, but somehow it all just got worse and more complicated p  pI hope some of you guys would take the time to analyse my really screwed up source code

Negative 5569 pIm working on a project for a client that involves a pretty huge ETL process to move data from MSSQL Server to Postgres.  We are using SSIS 2014 with the ODBC drivers provided on postgresql.org, and have setup an ODBC DSN.  We are only using built in OLEDB Sources and ODBC Destinations, and we are running into an issue that I have not been able to find referenced anywhere else online.p  pThe exact issue is that SSIS seems to open multiple connections for each ODBC destination data flow component, even with connection pooling enabled.  This can result in 50 idle connections being opened, which are not killed until the process is completed.  Previewing data from Visual Studio causes connection leaks as well which will only be killed upon restarting Visual Studio.  We have temporarily resolved this by increasing the maximum connections to 1000, but we are hoping to fix the underlying problem if possible.p  pIve done a decent amount of experimentation, and the issue seems to be SSIS related as opposed to an error in the driver.p  pHas anyone else run into a similar issue and know how to resolve thisp  pEDIT  Thought this wasnt going to be a big issue, but now I realize that ODBC connections are leaking when the SSIS package is run from Integration Services as well.  Ive played with it a bit by making some empty packages and adding only a single ODBC source and also a package which only accesses the database from C script task only the ODBC sourcedestinations are causing leaking and not script components, so it seems like a bug in SSIS and not my script tasks or the postgres driver Op  pAnyone have any idea how to resolve this besides rewriting the whole package to not use ODBC sourcesdestinations or some other weird thing like killing all connections afterwards with a shell scriptp

Negative 5569 pIm trying to get a single column from 2 tables that have nothing to do with each other. I want a single table with a column of links to my favorites, and a column of DISTINCT links to my recent history instead of having 2 separate tables with one column each. Ive tried lots of nested queries, unions, joins, etc but I still have duplicates. I want ALL of my favorites, but not ALL of my history theres thousands of records. So if I use top 10 to filter down history, I might be cutting favorites short as I could have 15. p  pIf I have 15 favorites I want all of those, and if 15 is the number then show top 15 recent with no repeats. Is this ever remotely possible p  precodeselect distinct t1.id, lta hrefrtrimt1.pagename.htmgtrtrimt1.favnameltagt as favorite, lta hrefrtrimt2.screenS.htmgtrtrimt2.screenltagt as recent  from select web2favname.pagename, web2favname.favname, rownumber over partition by null order by select NULL as id       from web2favname       t1 join      select distinct top 20 screen, rownumber over partition by null order by select NULL as id       from usertrace       t2      on t1.id  t2.id codepre  pIm just guessing the top number, but it still shows repeats of the favorites. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commIK7m.png altenter image description herep

Negative 5569 pI have a few Hive tables where some of them are in Avro format and some of them are in plain textfile.

When the button is clicked to be expanded I would like to use codeWebDriverWait.UntilExpectedConditions.ElementExistsBy.Xpathltxpath relative to container WebElementgtcode but I can only figure out how to use an xpath for the entire DOM which may contain any number of these action buttons which are only identifiable by there container type and ID.p  pI have run into other situations where I want to set up a WebDriverWait for xpath relative to a known webelement as well. I am quite new to working with Selenium and C programming for that matter. Thanks for your time and consideration on this question.p

Negative 5569 pIm developing two apps which make use of the same online server to access mysqli databases. Up to a few moments ago they both worked fine, however now theyre both crashing with a null exception when I use a http get request to load data in JSON format from my database.

Negative 5569 pI want to create a dependency injection pattern, where objects are sending themselves to be configured by an external Injector class. The external Injector will look for objects that conform to a certain protocol, and configure attributes for the received object, based on that. p  pI had this pattern implemented in Objective C the init method would call the Injector with parameter self, and then the Injector would call setters for the missing dependencies.p  pIn Swift however, a method needs to receive inout parameters to be able to change their properties, and you cannot send self as an inout parameter for good reason, as I understand.p  pStill, how can I do this in SWIFTp
