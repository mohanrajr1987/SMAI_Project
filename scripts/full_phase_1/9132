Positive 9132 pI have looked everywhere for this answer and cant seem to find anything that works. I am using bootstrap in my navbar, and the navbar collapses when the window is small. When it is collapsed and then opened via the button, the navigation links are centered and each of their respective drop down menus align to the left of the page, so it doesnt function well.

Positive 9132 pBasically, the date and note count are both on the same line, yet the like button isnt. Ive tried floating them all left, displayinline, displayblock and displayinlineblock and nothing has worked. It might be because the like button has too wide a width for it to all fit on one line As wherever I click upon the line, the button turns red to show Ive liked it. Even when I havent clicked the heart. However I have no idea how to stop it doing this, and make it only register when the heart is clicked on. p  precode.entry .perma,.entry .perm      backgroundcolor coloraccents     borderright 3px coloraccents solid    blockIndexPage     ltdiv classpermgt         lta targetblank hrefReblogURLgtTimeAgoltagt          ampnbspampnbsp         lta Target hrefPermalinkgtNoteCountWithLabel ltagt          ampnbspampnbsp LikeButton size14      ltdivgt blockIndexPage  blockPermalinkPage     ltsection classpostnotesgt         blockNoteCount             ltspan classnotecountgt                 lta Target hrefReblogURLgtNoteCountWithLabelltagt,             ltspangt         blockNoteCount         blockContentSource             ltspan classcontentsourcegtLangSource                  lta Target titleSourceTitle hrefSourceURLgtSourceTitleltagt,              ltspangt         blockContentSource         blockRebloggedFrom             ltspan classrebloggedfromgt                 langReblogged from ReblogParentName 2             ltspangt         blockRebloggedFrom         blockNotReblog             blockDate                 ltspan classnotrebloggt                     langPosted TimeAgo                 ltspangt             blockDate         blockNotReblog         blockHasTags,              langTags                  blockTags                     lta hrefTagURLgt Tagltagt                 blockTags         blockHasTags          blockNoteCount             PostNotes         blockNoteCount     ltsectiongt blockPermalinkPage codepre

Positive 9132 pIve added four StackPanes, each with a Rectangle and a Label on them, to the sides of a BorderPane. I want the Labels on the right and left sides to be rotated 90 and 90 degrees, respectively. When I apply such rotations to either the whole StackPanes or just the Labels on them, the rotation apparently does nothing to change the underlying height and width of the nodes, and thus my alignment is off. Is there an easy fix to thisp  pEDIT Since I cant post a screenshot here, what Im seeing is that the 400x400 pane is stretched to fit the width of the two rectangles that is, their width before rotation.

Positive 9132 pI have a C app running on 64 bit Linux. I am planning to pass a simple struct data without virtual function in it from one thread to another thread  in same process via pipe WITHOUT any special consideration of alignment.

And there wont be any plan to pass the data to a different process or remote machine in the future.  p  pI am positive that the code will work as expected. p  pHowever, I like to get opinions from experts of SO on my approach to see if there is any potential issues.  as testing might not disclose them in this case.p

Negative 9132 pIve just started messing around with a hrefhttpjline.sourceforge.netJLinea to parse character input in console mode.

I am not going to use a GUI. The usual InputStream IO in Java in console mode requires you to hit the Enter key first e.g. its buffered input only. Please dont tell me characterbycharacter input in console mode is impossible in Java it isnt. JLine does it using a portable interface with a platformdependent implementation.p  pstrongEdit updatestrong I was able to hack together a helper class to do the blocking IO in a worker thread using JLine for the percharacter IO, warning you have to parse CtrlC yourself amp then communicate via a synchronized queue with an isempty routine.

Negative 9132 pIm using Bazaar for version control, which Im very happy with.  In Bazaar every treeproject in source control is called a branch.p  pCurrently I have a main branch for the actual application, and a dev branch which houses some things like unit tests, as well as the user manual, etc.  This way, both the app and its associated tests are versioned, but separately.p  pHowever, I suspect that the way Im doing it is not the best way.  For example, if I were to create release branches from that main branch, then these release branches would get out of sync with the unit tests, unless I branched those in the same way.p  pCurrently, in order to create a snapshot of the application, I just export all files from that main branch and zip them up, because there is nothing in that branchs tree that isnt part of the app that will get sent to clients.p  pWhat would be a better way to do what Im doing  Should the unit tests go into that same main branch as the app, and if so what is a convenient way to easily create a snapshot ie the equivalent of a daily build which contains only the files that will be distributed with the appp  pemThank you all for your answers.  It was hard to decide whose answer to accept.

Basically, its a List of SelectList objects, just not of the same class name.p  pI imagine you could use reflection to turn the domain object into an interface object.

Negative 9132 pI am looking for a way of easily maintaining a list of Users belonging to a particular Group.br I have thought about using a Picklist, where I have 2 listboxs, the first contains a list of Users the second a list of Users belonging to the Group. There will be buttons to allow the adding and removing of selected Users from the Group. As users are added they move from the left listbox to the right, as they are removed they are move from the right to the list. This is pretty common situation.  p  pDo you know of any examples of doing this in WPF using the MVVM pattern  p  pI am having difficulty understand how the binding may work to my View Model and Business Entities. Especially persisting the data back to the database. I am using stored procedure calls to do the CRUD logic, so I need to keep a list of which Users had been removed so I can delete them.  p  pIs this the best way to perform this functionality or is there a better way. I simply want to pick from a list the list may be large.p

Negative 9132 pIm on the android bandwagon and started going through googles view tutorials. Here is what Im using Eclipse Galileo Android SDK 2.1 Java SDK 6.Something I think.p  pEverything was hunkydory until I hit the grid view tutorial. I got errors all over the place when I started editing the HelloGridview.java File. I thought Id fix it by following through with the next part of the tutorial, creating the ImageAdapter class, but it created more. I realized alot of my issues could be resolved by importing widgets which were not mentioned in the tutorial i.e. android.widget.GridView, .ImageView, .BaseAdapter etc. However, after all the reconciliation suggested by eclipse the files were finally showing no errors. I go to run it as an android app and bam, Your project contains errors. window comes up. There are no errors showing on the files Ive created.

Negative 9132 pI have a script which adds click event handlers to about 500 elements in the page via JQuery .live or .bind not decided which yet, and I am having a JQuery performance issue.  p  pWith a small dataset, I can load the page and as soon as the page has finished loading according to the browser, I can click on something and off we go.  But increase the data set and there is a definite delay between the page load ending and my click being handled, which I can only assume is JQuery still working off attaching the event handlers  the click is handled correctly, so I am assuming it gets queued and then handled.p  pIs there any way to have JQuery wait for the .live to finish before moving on, or in other words handle it synchronously rather than asynchronously if that makes sense  This is so I can put a loading screen up before starting the .live call, and take it down when its done.p  pRegards Moop

Negative 9132 pAs I began writing web applications with asp.net I started with small projects that used a LinqToSQL mapper for database access to a MSSQL Server.br After gaining some expierence I switched into a classic 3 tier with Graphic Layer, Business Layer, Data Layer. The only function of the Data Layer was to provide methods insertupdatedelete without any logic and logic the form of selection methods.p  pOver the time I realized that it would be better not to provide the database classes up to the GUI took some time unfortunately. I switched into using Business classes in the BL that are used for all operations performed by the BL and display by the GUI in the form of getting List from the BL.br A great advantage is that I can provide additional properties that are not represented by the database itself. However, I did that mapping inside the BL myself with methods that mapped the corresponding BL class to the database class.  p  pI guess thats where OR mapper come in handy Until now I havent realized their purpose, but I think I just found it. Ive recently tried out using the new Entity Framework with .net framework 4, but Im only using it like the LinqToSQL DataContext.p  pIs there a way to achieve the mapping automatically If yes, is that something the new Entity Framework provides or do I need to look for a OR Mapper like NHibernatep

The HTML Page calls the callback function and rebuilds the DOM with the results from the JSON.p  pIt thus seems inevitable that using Ajax in this form will result public API just send getResults.php a request with a query and you will get easy to use JSON.p  pIs there anyway to block these Ajax calls This is more acute when setting database entries, and not only retrieving.p  pThanks,p  pJoelp

Negative 9132 pWhat advantages do LL parsers have over LR parsers to warrant their relative popularity in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiComparisonofparsergeneratorstodays parser generator toolsap  pAccording to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLRparserWikipediaa, LR parsing appears to have advantages over LLp  blockquote   pLR parsing can handle a larger range of languages than LL parsing, and is also better at error reporting, i.e. it detects syntactic errors when the input does not conform to the grammar as soon as possible. This is in contrast to an LLk or even worse, an LL parser which may defer error detection to a different branch of the grammar due to backtracking, often making errors harder to localize across disjunctions with long common prefixes.p blockquote  pNote This is not homework. I was just surprised when I found out that Antlr is an LL parser generator despite having LR in its name.p

Negative 9132 pI seem to be getting conflicting advice in the books I read on this functionality. Im wondering if someone could clarify. For example Nicholas Zakas states the function argument has a signature of the format functionmatch, pos, originalText P139  Pro JavaScript for Web Developers 2nd ed  Wroxp  pHe goes on to say When the regular expression has one match, the function gets passed three arguments as above. When there are multiple capture groups, each matched string is passed in as an argument, with the last two positions being the position and originalText...p  pThen we come to Doug Crockfords, JavaScript The Good Parts. P90 He stipulates the syntax again as stringsearcValue,replaceValue searchValue can be a regex  great a match.. if replaceValue is a function, the first parameter is the matched text, then second is capture group 1, the third is capture group 2 and so on.. There is a noticeable difference here. ie. No position argumentp  pI was also looking at an example in Pro JavaScript Design patterns APress P152 that started this whole cross referencing process off. These guys Ross HarmesDustin Diaz, rather unhelpfully specify the replaceValue function with two arguments named a amp b. But it tends to reinforce the notion Doug Crockford describes.p  pCan someone confirm whether the Nicholas Zakas description is indeed a valid option toop

Negative 9132 pIm aware that there probably isnt a perfect solution to my question this sounds like a variation of the knapsack or the bin packing problem, but heres my scenario p  pI want to divide a list of SQL database tables into n lets say 7 roughly equallysized piles so I can spread some maintenance tasks roughly equally across an entire week. p  pLets say I have 100 tables this could be higher or lower, but not likely higher than 5000, ranging from size 1 to size 10,000,000 larger tables are much less common, of course.p  pMy original idea was to sort the tables alphabetically pseudorandomly then walk through from the beginning, moving to the next group when the total exceeds SumSize7. For some databases, this will probably work fine, but if two giant tables are right next to each other, then this makes for very unequal groups. This isnt as unlikely as it sounds, consider two huge tables, AccountHistory and AccountHistoryArchive.p  pAre there any generally accepted techniques for this, that give good results with a variety of source data Id lean toward a simpler technique rather than a more precise grouping if the maintenance runs slightly longer on some days than others, its not emthatem big of deal.p

Im making an openaddressed table with a variant of quadratic hashing, which is backed internally by two arrays, one for keys and one for values.  I dont have the ability to resize though.  The obvious way to do it is to create larger arrays and then hash all of the key, value pairs into the new arrays from the old ones.

Negative 9132 pI am playing around with C and the jQuery UI Dialog box tonight. I have added a dialog div to a user management page that will enable Administrators to edit user information such as address, phone, aspnetdb stuff. When the admin clicks on a row in a grid view, the dialog is activated, but the controls text boxes and drop downs take a few seconds to populate with the information. I would like the dialog to present the users information, allow changes to the controls, allow the administrator to save the data, and then update the grid view which is inside of an update panel.p  pIs there a way through Code Behind and jQuery to only show the dialog box after all of the fields have been filled in by the Datatable dataset xsdp  pThanks in advance for your help.

Negative 9132 pIm just wondering about the performance of the Number class as opposed to, say using generics or even a whole lot of functions to handle primitive types.p  pThe primitive types would clearly be the fastest option I would assume, however if the performance hit is not too huge, it would likely be easier for the coder to just use the Number class or generics rather than making a function that accepts and returns long, double etc.p  pI am about to do a performance benchmark of the 3 options mentioned. Is there anything I should be aware oftry out when doing this, or even better, has someone done this before that they can give me results top

Negative 9132 pI have a python project that takes in two Excel spreadsheets with various data as input, and depending on given parameters in a python run type module, produces several spreadsheets which contain statistical information as outputs.  I have several versions of this project released already to a few clients, but testing to make sure that the input spreadsheets, their parameters in a python module, and their corresponding output spreadsheets are the same is very time consuming because I have a lot of possible parameters that can be used.  Is there a tool or something I can do or use to automate testing for my project to ensure inputs, parameters and outputs of past versions of the project match the latest versionp  pI know that there are many testing modules in python in particular unittest, nose, Scons, doctest etc, but I was wondering if anyone knew of a simpler tool for testing inputs and outputs, or a way to create my own quickly.

I can readily import the printer type library as a component that Im a client of, but Im unsure what I need to do to be the other side of that conversation. I suspect Im looking at something the wrong way but pretty much all the reference material Ive found assumes I want to be a client or that I want to define an entirely new server. Im also a COM newbie so its a little confusing. Ive been playing with XE and D7, and have created a tlb as per the printer control but obviously havent quite been able to get it to fly.p  pCan anyone give me a nudge in the right direction here  p

Negative 9132 pI use a lot of singletons, I have set up many as I call them singleton frameworks.p  pAlso, I like to write the definition of the singleton in the prefix header of my XCode project, so I can use all my singletons in every class with only 1 line of code To me this seems like heaven, but I keep noticing that I have to deal a lot with memory warnings in all of my apps. So I was wondering, does that have anything to do with putting my singleton definitions in the prefix header To me it seems since a singleton is only one instance it doesnt matter at all if you put it in the prefix header or not. Perhaps its more the fact that the 8 different singletons exist at the same time, each of them having different objectsp  pHere is an example of a regular prefix header in my projectsp  precodeImports import Program.h import Category.h import GetSpecs.h import FlurryAPI.h import AdSmallView.h import SoundPlayer.h import ButtonAlert.h import NSViewHelper.h import NSDateHelper.h import NSStringHelper.h import TESTAppDelegate.h import EGORefreshTableHeaderView.h  Singletons define gSpecs [GetSpecs sharedGetSpecs] define bAlert [ButtonAlert sharedButtonAlert] define sPlayer [SoundPlayer sharedSoundPlayer] define adSmallV [AdSmallView sharedAdSmallView] define vHelper [NSViewHelper sharedNSViewHelper] define dateHelper [NSDateHelper sharedNSDateHelper] define nsprefs [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] define strHelper [NSStringHelper sharedNSStringHelper] define pDel TESTAppDelegate [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] codepre  pSo to conclude, I have 2 questions  1. is it bad practice to put singleton definitions in the prefix header 2. can memory issues be caused by this prefix header part or is it more possible its the fact that many different singletons are continuously alivep

Negative 9132 pI have a domain with 2 subdomains like this www.domain.com and secure.domain.com with ssl. www subdomain will be running vbulletin prone to xss attacks and the webservice behind secure subdomain is well, more secure as well as more sensitive to attacks since real money is involved there. domain.com is 301 redirecting to www.domain.com. Now Id like to have a single signon to both of the services without compromising the security of the secure subdomain. It seems to me there are 2 ways of doing thisp  ol lipUsing OpenID and after successful authentication, set cookie domain only to subdomains respectively, example .www.domain.com and .secure.domain.com so that secure.domain.com cookies will not be sent to the attacker in case of an intrusion in www.domain.compli lipOnly enable users to log on from secure.domain.com and set 2 cookies, 1 with .domain.com for seamless authentication to www.domain.com and another cookie to .secure.domain.com to verify that the user has authenticated through secure subdomain.pli ol  pMy understanding is that when it comes to sso across several webapps on a single domain and its subdomains, then running any app on top level domain such as domain.com would be a potential security risk because the app on top level will always be sent all the cookies set by subdomains as well as subdomains will be able to set and receive cookies of the top level domain.p  pstrongThe question is thisstrong Are my assumptions correct or did I miss somethingp

Negative 9132 pI have used Interface Builder in Xcode 4.02 to add two UIPickerViews in a View. They are connected to the same delegate and datasource UIViewController. In my .h file I have also declared UIPickerViews and connected them as reference outlets, as in many examples.  In viewForRow I use the same NSMutable data array of UILabels to return the appropriate values this array was populated in viewDidLoad. p  pHowever, I find that no Label appears in both UIPickerViews at the same time. For example, when the app starts each UIPickerView should show elements 0, 1 and 2. viewForRow is invoked 3 times for each UIPickerView but only the view which invokes viewForRow second will display the first 3 rows. The other UIPickerView is blank. If I scroll the first view down to, say, the 6th element and then back to the first, the view will then show the first 3 elements but the second view the one that did show the first 3 rows now shows nothing. Specifically, no data array element will appear in both UIPickerViews at the same time. p  pIs this expected Should each UIPickerView have its own backing array  if youre using them Arent all these returned views just pointers Its as if each array element can only be displayed pointed to at most once at any time.p  pIf I use two separate data arrays then there appear to be no problems. But it does mean extra memory and extra coding.p  pNote in viewForRow I have code to set the labels sizep  precode    UILabel xx  UILabel [self.array1 objectAtIndexrow]             CGSize rowSize  [thePickerView rowSizeForComponentcomponent]     CGRect labelRect  CGRectMake 0, 0, rowSize.width, rowSize.height     [xx setFramelabelRect] codepre  pThe values set here do not change even when the row later appears to be blank.p

Negative 9132 pWe are developing an MDA platform that has support for Web Services. The user can provide a WSDL in runtime and we generate all the artifacts service interface and implementation for the server, and consumer for the client using JAXWS internally.p  pWe want to add validation on the WSDL document provided by the user. Right now the user has to validate that with an external tool like Oxygen, XMLSpy or a web tool, but we want to add that as a part of our system. A nicetohave feature would be schema validation aswell, including the embedded schemas of the WSDLs.p  pIn JAXWS RI there is support for schema validation in runtime using the SchemaValidation annotation but we havent found any support for WSDL validation.p  pWeve tried to integrate a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgUsingtheWSDLValidatorOutsideofEclipse relnofollowEclipses WSDL validatora but it doesnt seem to work for us.p  pIs there any way of doing this with JAXWS  If not, is there any other validation framework that we can integratep  pThanksp

Negative 9132 pIm running into a situation where I have two levels of polymorphism, one within the other, in a parentchild hierarchy.p  pI think this is best explained by a simple examplep  precode    class Group              public IListltPersongt People  get set            class SpecialGroup  Group              public IListltSpecialPersongt People  get set            class Person       class SpecialPerson  Person  codepre  pSo a Group has a list of Person objects, while a specialized Group SpecialGroup has a specialized list of Person SpecialPerson objects.p  pThis compiles, but I get a warning saying I should use the new keyword on SpecialGroup.People, because it hides the Group.People property.p  pI understand what that means, but perhaps I dont fully comprehend how you would model something like this correctly in C to begin with. Any thoughts on how to model this in a better wayp  pAlso, any idea how this would play with NHibernate Im not sure using the new keyword will cut it, since the Group.People property would already be mapped with a different type. Is there a better way to model this, in a way that is compatible with NHp  hr  pOkay, I thought of a way to model this using genericsp  precode    abstract class AbstractGroupltPersonTypegt         where PersonType  Person              public IListltPersonTypegt People  get set            class Group  AbstractGroupltPersongt           class SpecialGroup  AbstractGroupltSpecialPersongt           class Person       class SpecialPerson  Person  codepre  pI think this does what I want Now Person can share traits with SpecialPerson, but only a SpecialPerson can be added to a SpecialGroup. The AbstractGroup basetype can model the traits common to any Group.p  pNow the question is, will NH blow up if I try to map thisp  hr  pFor the record, it appears some people have successfully used queryover with generic classes  for HQL queries my usecase this is unsupported.p  pAnother approach that occurred to me, is to simply hide the parents implementation of a property, e.g. using the new keyword for an overriding property in a subclass  the following thread discusses why that wont work eitherp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2159427nhibernatetablepersubclassmappingandthenewkeywordNHibernate Table Per Subclass Mapping and the New Keywordap  pConclusion thus far runtime checking and exceptions, as proposed by empi below.p

Negative 9132 pI want to set up a project page on GitHub, so that it acts as a live site.p  pThe site would require an API sid amp token both just long strings of text that, in a selfhosted environment, the user would just add to the config file.p  pIf I host this through GitHub project pages, users will supply their sidtoken through a form. The page with the form will need to be served over SSL so that the sidtoken arent transferred as cleartext. The problem is that GitHub project pages dont allow SSL.p  pSo, if I can find another secure way to take input through a form aside from using SSL, then I can host this whole thing a hosted service through GitHub project pages.p  pThe project would be open source, so I dont expect any sort of encodinghashing scheme to work, since the methods would be public.p  pThe sidtoken are being used in curl calls to an API which emisem sent over SSL. Perhaps theres a way to direct the form input directly to that SSL URL instead of having it go through the nonSSL GitHub project page...p  pAny ideasp

As a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5906026808808this stackoverflow answera suggests a service in a library project may cause problems, I have made the service abstract and inherited it in the subprojects this also lets me use different public keys for each reskin which is desirable.li liThere are plenty of UI elements that need to know if billing is supported as soon as possible.li ol  pConsequently I am calling a function to check if billing is supported from the codeonCreatecode method of the first activity run actually any activity, but a preference will then be written so this should only happen once.p  pIn the Dungeons sample, the code to check if billing is supported tries to bind to the billing service thus from the codeServicecode classp  precodeboolean bindResult  bindService     new IntentConsts.MARKETBILLINGSERVICEACTION,     this,   ServiceConnection.     Context.BINDAUTOCREATE codepre  pthis call is throwing a codeNullPointerExceptioncode.  Ive checked pretty carefully and none of these things are null its occurring emwithinem the function, apparently at line 370 of ContextWrapper.java.p  pBecause of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5771233808808this other stackoverflow answera I wondered if checking billing from codeonCreatecode might be premature but the Dungeons example project, again, calls it from here, so I dont think its this.p  pI am using a much later version of Android 3.1 so that might have an effect, but Id love to know the possible causes of this.  One other thing Eclipse is telling me codecustomIntentcode is null, but its not fully clear what that refers to and Ive not been able to find much about it.p

Negative 9132 pI have an existing Java web application running on Linux using embedded Jetty.  The application is loaded using jsvc, which runs as root, listens on port 443, and relays requests to the Java app, which is run under a less privileged user appname on port 8443.p  pCurrently, the application reads an encryption key from a file well call secrets.properties.  It is writable by root, and readable by appname technically, by members of the appname group.  My preference, however, would be that the file is only readable by root, and that jsvc reads the file and passes the contents of that file or even just a single property to the application.  My goal is that if someone were able to subvert the app and gain system access with the apps appname account, that they couldnt retrieve the key.p  pIs that possible without having the key visible to someone running ps exp

One table per entity, one row per object, active record etc.p  pMy schema uses disjoint subtypes, so multiple tables per entity, and has revision history so edits actually create a new row, but only in one table depending on the fields editedp  pDoes EF cater for this kind of custom behaviour or is it geared toward conventional patterns My understanding is that I create a schema or domain objects, and the database manipulation code is automatically generated.

Negative 9132 pSo I did some research and apparently the storage requirements can increase significantly with key size.p  pIn reality I want to be able to use a long int as my key but this wont be possible as couchdb requires that keys are strings correct  Is there any way to circumvent this p  pBecause my ids look likep  precode id  10209939, ....data here ...   id  10209940, ....data here ...   id  10209941, ....data here ...  codepre  pI would like to keep them numerical to do range queries. But since the storage increases along with key length, my storage will explode. In a sense, these ids represented as strings take many more bytes that they would should they be interpreted as long ints. p  pHas anybody had experience storing documents with a numerical integer as ids  How did you get good storage efficiency given that couchdb understands id as being a string  Can we tell it, no its a long int not a string.p

Negative 9132 pQ1. So I have a webapp project in eclipse Java EE, which already has wsdl2java.xml and the stubs files in place. This was all done using an earlier version of Apache axis. Now in order to get a new wsdl2java.xml from apache axis2 would I have to rebuild everything from the command line and then drop it in to my existing project Would I be executing the wsdl2java jar in the command line designating parameters, destinations and wsdl filesp  pQ2. Now when I had originally tried executing the build file wsdl2java.xml without changing anything I received an error from java relating to ...too many parameters in java method, can not exceed over 255... or something to that fact. Now, will axis2 or jaxws be able to fix that problem p  pand finally...p  pQ3. If I use jaxws can the current stubs that I have, which were built with axis, be replaced by the new jaxws generated stubsp

Negative 9132 pIm coding an alarm clock application, and i would like to know what happens, when I set some alarm with AlarmManager for example at time 259am this is not time of my alarm, this is only time WHEN i set some alarm, and at 300am there will be automatic time change from summer time to winter DST. What happens with my scheduled alarm I found nothing in docs, and its not so easy to test, at least I must change dates and wait few hours...Im not so patient p  pNext problem  I was also curious, what happens with my alarms set with AlarmManager when user changes timezone. This was luckily pretty easy to test, and I found, that android is pretty intelligent and reschedule alarm automatically. So when in my timezone is for example 900 and i set alarm on 1000, and switch timezone 1 hours where actual time is 1000, android reschedule my alarm to 1100, as expected. This is very fine, however, i didnt found also anything in docs...p  pAnybody has more official information Thxp
Negative 9132 pTheres a very strange line spacing bug in iOS5 for iPad If youre using a UITableView within which each UITableViewCell is a custom type that contains a UITextView, then cells containing multiple lines of text from nonAZ languages such as Arabic are dequeued with the wrong line height AFTER the keyboard has been opened in a modal view.p  pemNote While this seems to be a bug in iOS, I am looking to find a workaround so that my app is backwardscompatible with versions of iOS5.emp  pHere is how to replicate the bugp  pstrong1astrong In your storyboard, create a UIViewController create your own subclass, though where you have a UIToolbar and a UITableView.

Negative 9132 pSo, what I want to do is, creating a custom element by using fxml and then add a couple of instances of that element into a container, like GridPane. The new operators does not work for me, because I would like to use the fxml annotator to get access to the element. Cloning would be nice, but it does not work. The FXMLLoader is very slow, when using in a for contruct to add many elements. It would be perfect, if I could write a reference into fxml parentnode, which could be called from the controller. p  pSorry... here in pseudo...p  ppublic class Controller implements Initializable p  precodeFXML private VBox stack  FXML private Button button  FXML private void ChangeKeyEvent event throws IOException           for int i0 ilt10 i         stack.getChildren.addbutton             codepre  pIt is no problem to add THE button to the VBox. But in a forcontruct to add MORE THAN ONE Button it fails. I could use the new operator in the for construct, but I want to know, if this is the only possiblity. I thought there must be another way e.g. to use the FXML annotator to get the button and then duplicate it.p

Negative 9132 pBACKGROUND Im part of a music sharing links TO gsyt on pirating group on facebook. Each day up to 20 members each post a link to a song that they think the community will like, and so we grow in enjoying that genre of music. At the end of the month, we would like to create a list of all the titles of all the songs that we posted each month.p  pPROBLEM Facebook does not offer this ability, it only offers a very light search functionality no subfilters, and even that search only returns the results of a string that  was found in posts. So, ex. search B.B. King will return posts with that string in it, and worse if the post was of that song, but in the post, the user did not comment with B.B.King, the result will not return that link. Fb also does not allow tagging of posts.p  pMESSING AROUND Through using a Chrome plugin called Stylish I able sometimes to hide most elements of a certain class on facebook pages aka custom useragent style and visually collect what I need. Unfortunately this did not work with my example. p  pI did narrow down name of the class of the div whos innerHTML contains the track and artist info I need.p  pGOAL I would like to create a Chrome plugin that will scrape the page for all instances of this div with this class name, and then store its innerHTML content in an array that I can later export. Doing so will allow me to create a full months list and post it as a file in the Facebook groups File tab.p  pPoint me in the right direction and Ill start tinkeringp  pThanks in advance. p
Negative 9132 pI want to provide certain info lets say a state variable  a boolean across processes. The state of this variable is maintained by a service, other apps shall only be able to read it not to modify it.p  pMy first thought was the SharedPreferences but theres a note on the docs stating that SharedPreferences usage is not supported across multiple processes. That leaves me with service messaging, AIDL, intents and ContentProvider.p  pService messaging or AIDL is out of the question because it always has an asynchronous part to it as well as Intents. I also thought of ContentProvider but it seems a little bit exaggeratedbloated just for this.

Obviously writing out 10gb worth of data would take forever and I need a timely approach.  My latest idea was to create a random access file and set the size to 2 gb but it seems that the .setLength function cant handle sizes that large.  Ive also thought about just appending one file to another to get a file large enough but it seems like there is no really good way to do that quickly either.  Any ideas out therep

Negative 9132 pI have a box2d world with the view locked into landscapeLeft.  Im trying to move a body by tilting the phone left or right, which is currently working.  I have problems when the level is started with the phone tilted in landscapeRight.  under this condition the gravity is no longer being applied, and my body which should be moving stands still. I believe this is a friction issue even though both my body to move and platform to move on are both 0 friction, because when I set the restitution of the platform my body is resting on to 1.0 so my body is now bounding a little in place the gravity is applied correctly always. This is not the box2d issue where bodies get stuck on corners of tiles as I only have 1 platform for my body to move on, and it does not move no matter where it is on the platform. here is my acceleration code.p  precode    voidaccelerometerUIAccelerometeraccelerometer didAccelerate UIAccelerationacceleration      if acceleration.x lt 0          b2Vec2 gravityacceleration.y  15, 8         worldgtSetGravitygravity       codepre  phere is my init codep  precode Define the gravity vector.     b2Vec2 gravity     gravity.Set0.0f, 10.0f       Do we want to let bodies sleep      This will speed up the physics simulation     bool doSleep  true       Construct a world object, which will hold and simulate the rigid bodies.     world  new b2Worldgravity, doSleep      worldgtSetContinuousPhysicstrue codepre

Given the lines of the document, the framework will ultimately produce a large object call it codeDocumentcode representing the document.p  pEarly filters in the pipeline will need to operate on a linebyline basis. However, filters further down will need to transform and ultimately produce the codeDocumentcode object.p  pTo implement this, I was thinking of using a filter definition like thisp  precodepublic interface IFilterltin TIn, out TOutgt      TOut ExecuteTIn data  codepre  pAll filters will be registered with a codePipelineManagercode class as opposed to using the linkedlist style approach. Before executing, codePipelineManagercode will verify the integrity of the pipeline to ensure that no filter is given the wrong input type.p  pstrongMy questionstrong Is it architecturally sound to have a pipeline with a changing data type i.e. a good ideap  pP.S. The reason Im implementing my application as a pipeline is because I feel it will be easy for plugin authors to replaceextend existing filters. Just swap out the filter you want to change with a different implementation, and youre set.p

Negative 9132 pI have a lot of data in JSON and want to import it to my db. My problem is, that I have several codeaftercreatecode and codeafterupdatecode methods in my controller, where other stuff is written to the db.p  pSo I was thinking to use the controller for importing the data. I can format my data to be the same format as the params hash. But when I create an instance of the controller, setting the params hash and calling codecreatecode it doesnt find some class variables.p  pThen I tried to force RSpecs controller test to do the work with a post, but I failed there too. Maybe its not possible, or there is even a better option to import data using all the hooks in my controllers.p

Negative 9132 pAn iOS application uses the geofencing for notifying the user about predefined nearby locations. The application is allowed to miss some location the user is not getting a notification about a nearby location, but it is desirable to keep the missing rate low.p  pOne way to implement this would be to start monitoring for significant change locations with codestartMonitoringSignificantLocationChangescode and each time the location change event is fired, look for locations within, let say, 500m radius of the reported location.p  pWhat worries me is the requirement to perform the query for the nearby regions each time the significant location change occurs and it impact on the battery.p  pThe other way to do it would be to register the locations with codestartMonitoringForRegioncode but Apple has put a reasonable limitation on the number of simultaneously tracked regions which is 20 and we have significantly more than 20 locations.

When I preview the site I can see the links to the various css and js files, and all are valid.li ol  pThank you for any help or suggestions you can providep  pstrongCode for Layout.cshtmlstrongp  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt      ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8 gt          ltlink hreffavicon.ico relshortcut icon typeimagexicon gt         ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth gt         lttitlegtTest Sitelttitlegt         RenderSectionhead, required false              ltscriptgt                 jQuery.noConflictfunction                       eislider.eislideshow                         animation center,                         autoplay true,                         slideshowinterval 3000,                         titlesFactor 0                                           ltscriptgt      ltheadgt  ltbody stylebackground FFFgt     ltdiv stylewidth100 background FFFgt         ltdiv classheadergt          lt LogoTitle gt              ltdiv idsitetitlegtlta hrefgt                 ltimg srcContentimglogo.png altMy Site Title gtltagt             ltdivgt                   ltol idmenugt              ltligtlta hrefgtHomeltagt                lt sub menu gt               ltolgt                   ltligtlta hrefgtNivo Sliderltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtEI Sliderltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtFullscreen Sliderltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtStatic Imageltagtltligt               ltolgt               ltligtlt end sub menu gt          ltligtlta hrefgtPagesltagt                lt sub menu gt               ltolgt                      ltligtlta hrefgtMagazineltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtBlogltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtFull Width Pageltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtColumnsltagtltligt               ltolgt         ltligtlt end sub menu gt          ltligtlta hrefgtElementsltagtltligt          ltligtlta hrefgtGalleriesltagt                lt sub menu gt               ltolgt                      ltligtlta hrefgtSimpleltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefHomeHardwaregtFilterableltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtFade Scrollltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtVideoltagtltligt                 ltli classlastgtlta hrefgtPhotoGridltagtltligt               ltolgt         ltligtlt end sub menu gt                 ltligtlta hrefgtContactltagtltligt     ltolgt         ltdivgt        lt END header gt         ltdivgt          RenderSectionpicturecycle, required false      ltdiv idcontainergt          RenderBody      ltdivgt       ltdiv idfootergt      lt First Column gt      ltdiv classonefourthgt         lth3gtUseful Linkslth3gt             ltul classfooterlinksgt                 ltligtlta hrefgtLorem Ipsumltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtEllem Cietltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtCurrivitasltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtSalim Aritultagtltligt             ltulgt     ltdivgt      lt Second Column gt      ltdiv classonefourthgt         lth3gtTermslth3gt             ltul classfooterlinksgt                 ltligtlta hrefgtLorem Ipsumltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtEllem Cietltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtCurrivitasltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtSalim Aritultagtltligt             ltulgt     ltdivgt      lt Third Column gt      ltdiv classonefourthgt         lth3gtInformationlth3gt         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Negative 9132 pWhen we first started developing for android, we had 2 projects  One for the core functionality, other for the business functionality. So far so good, we went through bad times waiting so much time for compilation of XML changes, but life was still quite bearable. After some time, we evolved or not to come with 9 projects. For some projects, we have a test project.  We also have some library projects, for instance, we have two different projects for different versions of android, and we have a shared project for shared configs or controllers. The reason for that is because our application is quite big. When we make some changes on the core project, we usually have to recompile, and clean the workspace with eclipse. Also, we usually have to use the Build Project option a few times for the projects to update their references, the first build hardly compiles everything, we call this in our team COMBO, which is the combination of F5 and CTRLB to compile the projects. All this setup is killing a lot of time and making developers sad, like, a team of 6 developers p  pI know that by this time we should pretty much know all the issues and the best options, but I cant believe the way it is. And after so many time searching and trying to improve, we cant seem to find other solutions to improve development time with android.p  pOur set of tools isp  ul liEclipse 4.2.1 li liADT 21.1.0 li liEclipse Colour Themes for a cute code li liSDK always updatedli ul  pHardwarep  ul liWindows 7 Professional 64 bitsli li8 GB RAMli liIntel Core i53470 3.20GHzli ul  pI would love answers aboutp  ul liCompilation time improvement Did you found any IDE that for YOU it was faster than eclipse Why How was the setup What are the drawbacks of using ADT and how can I improve performance with it, while using multiple projectsli liProject references management, is there any suggestion on how to speed up build Should I put the whole source code in a single project li liAny way to speed up development when you have the device and need to deploy it while testing the applicationli ul

Negative 9132 pI have a tab bar application that displays tableviews in two of the tabs. The tableviews are populated using NSFileManager to read the contents of a plist file stored with user data. One of the tabs displays the complete items, the other tab displays the Incomplete items. As the user selects a row, a page with the details of the item selected is displayed. In the incomplete table there is a button the user can press to move these details from the Incomplete table to a Completed table. The plist is then updated using NSFileManager to change a field detailing if the item is in the complete or the incomplete list for this item.p  pThe problem I have is that the changes are not updated on the two tables just by selecting between the two tabs. The user has to quit the application and start it up again to see the item moved from one table to the other.p  pThe data seems to be updated its just the view that doesnt update.p  pIm new to cocoa so any help at all would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 9132 pI have an answer about how Paypal calculates the fees to apply to each receiver in case of a chained or parallel payment done with the Adaptive Payment API.p  pIs the fee calculated on the total amount payed by the sender In this case each receiver would pay a proportional portion of the total fee. Or is it charged a fee to each amount in which the transaction is split We will work with Spanish fees 3.4  0.35 euros and in this last case Paypal charges would be significantly higher because of the fixed 0.35 euros that would be charged to each transaction. We are mainly worried about the case this also applies to the commission for the marketplace because we would be loosing money in some transactions when our commission would be lower than 0.35 euros.p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comwebappsdeveloperdocsclassicadaptivepaymentsintegrationguideAPIntroThis is the only infoa Ive found and I still didnt understand it. p  pIn the text they do not specify that issue unless I am misunderstanding anything due to I am Spanishspeaking, so I had tried to deduce it with the examples at the end of the text although they pointed that The scenario above is an example only and is not representative of actual PayPal fees. p  pBut it resulted that the scenarios were completely unreal as they charged a higher fee to a secondary receiver that was receiving an amount of 130 than other receiving 150. So it was impossible for me to get any conclusion.p

However, when a template, say itemdelete, is rendered into an routeA, then I click along into routeB, then go back to routeA, I get the error.

Negative 9132 pSo I have a codeUISegmentedControlcode consisting of four tabs. What I need to do is make it so the most recently tapped tab will be remembered throughout the length of the app session. That is, when the app is first started the first codeUISegmentControllercode tab will be selected, then the user clicks the third tab, then the user decides to go to a different view in the app, and then when the user comes back to the view with the codeUISegmentedControlcode the most recentthird in this case tab is still be selected.p  pIve seen that the codeNSUserDefaultscode class is good for saving settings, BUT to my understanding the codeNSUserDefaultscode class saves data in a manner that even when the app is killed and then started it restores the previous settings saved. Which is something that I do not want, I only want the app to save the most recently selected tab for the length of the app session it was selected in.p  pI hope I am making sense, if more informationcodeexplanation is needed please let me know.p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 9132 pDont be intimidated by the length of this post Ive just copied the code from jsfiddlep  pIm trying to fix pins on an image map that fits all screensizes without becoming distorted i.e. maxheight and maxwidth are 100 and Ive managed to get the pins somewhat fixed. However, although the following codein the jsfiddle looks like it works for some sizes, the pins slowly move away from their place as the dimensions of the window change. Have a look if you dont see the change in the fiddle itself, you can try copying and pasting the code onto a texteditor and then opening it on a browser. Resize the browser to a longnarrowstrip or a widenarrowstrip and youll see what I mean p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbKbWf relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netbKbWfap  pThanks to anyone who can help solve this.p  pThe code same as the stuff on the above jsfiddle is posted below HTMLp  precodeltdiv classmapNpinsgt ltmap and pins begin heregt     ltdiv classmapcontainergtltimg class map srchttpwww.placekitten.com1024635gt         ltul class  ulistgt             ltli classpin1gtlta hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPhiladelphiagtltimg srchttpwww.placekitten.com2020gtltagtltligt                 ltli classpin2gtlta hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBostongtltimg srchttpwww.placekitten.com2020gtltagtltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt lt map and pins end here gt ltdivgt     codepre  pCSSp  precode.mapNpins  can be used to  manipulateposition the entire mapNpins block display block  border 2px solid red  .mapcontainer  position relative this is so that later each listelement     i.e. pin can be positioned with respect to the mappicture         i.e. the pins will be able to moveresize with the map textalign center centers map horizontally  .map paddingleft 0.7 misc. image correction maxwidth 100  map image resizes with screen  maxheight 100 map image resizes with screen  .ulist  liststyle none to remove the bullets  .ulist li a  display block position absolute allows each listelement to be controlled          individually, but all with respect to .mapcontainer which             is the first parent that has posrelative   positioning the pins .mapcontainer .ulist .pin1 a  textalign center  border 2px solid orange border color only for recognition left 25 top37  .mapcontainer .ulist .pin2 a  border 2px solid blue border color only for recognition left 35 top47 codepre

Negative 9132 pI ask this as a programming and environment question. Can you testprogram CUDA within a virtual machine accessing the physical GPU cardp  pI am buying a new really nice system to, in part, experiment with basic CUDA programming. The processor will be an Intel i74770 which supports VTd direct IO passthrough OR a i74770K which does not. Will the VTd support allow access to the GPU card from the VMs I have looked at Intel, motherboard mfg. sites, and docs on VMs but did not see an answer to this question.p  pI plan to run Linux as my base operating system on the new development box with virtual machines probably via QEMUKVM to test the software in other environments such as Windows and Mac OS. I other words, I would do the major development on the Linux box and then need to test on a virtual machine running on the same box.p  pBut, will the VM OSs be able to access the GPU card for testingdevelopmentp  p[First asked July 2013]p

Negative 9132 pToday, ive upgraded Sonar from version 3.1.1 to 3.7 and got a problem and spent many hours to solve it.p  pI want to share because i dont know if its Sonar issue or a bad usage of our team...p  pAfter the installation of Sonar 3.7, all my analysis were on failure...p  pThe cause was the Double Checked Locking Checkstyle rule that has been deleted in Checkstyle 5.6 but seemed to be still executed in my analysis.p  pI checked quality profiles in sonar but the rule was not activated for any profile...p  pHowever, the export of the Checkstyle configuration file from the permalink was containing the rulep  pIve tried to create a new profile with a Checkstyle configuration file without the rule, but the export was always the same...p  pSo i asked to my colleague who configured the quality profile the first time ive installed Sonar... and he found the problem in 5min...p  pWhen he configured the profile, he put an entire Checkstyle configuration file containing the rule in the global Java Checkstyle parameters Configuration  Parameters  Java  Checkstyle  Filters. The export of the Checkstyle configuration used for my analysis was the value of the sonar.checkstyle.filters and not a real export of the profile configuration.p  pSo Im wondering if its a Sonar issue or a normal behaviour and a bad usage of our team...p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 9132 pI currently have a process which reads files from AWS S3 and concatenates them using EMR.  The input files have the following format 1 header row and 1 data row. Fields are commaseparated and wrapped in doublequotes.p  pExamplebr headerfield1,headerfield2,headerfield3,...br datafield1,datafield2,datafield3,...p  pThe files vary in size between 90 and 200 bytes.brp  pThe output file has the following formatbr headerfield1,headerfield2,headerfield3,...br file1datafield1,file1datafield2,file1datafield3,...br file2datafield1,file2datafield2,file2datafield3,...br file3datafield1,file3datafield2,file3datafield3,...br ....p  pMy current approach uses a default mapper and a single reducer to concatenate all the data rows and prepend 1 header row at the top of the final output file. Because I want to have a single header row in the output final, I was forced to use only 1 single reducer in my EMR job. This I feel, drastically increases runtime.p  pEarly tests ran great with tens of files.  However, I am trying to scale this application to run for thousands of files with the final goal of concatenating 1 million.p  pMy current process for 1000 files is still running after 30 minutes, which is too long. Do you have any suggestions on where I can improve my application to dramatically improve overall performancep  pthank you.p

Seems like a bad choice, especially since this manifest info is very useful for debugging issues as it is really the only way to verify an enduser is running the correct version of the app short of direct physical inspection onsite. This is especially true of our applet since the jars are allowed to be cached on client systems along with the corresponding JavaScript to access the applet, meaning they could very easily be running the wrong jars after upgradesdowngrades, etc. Not having this info in our logs could lead to large headaches in the future.p  pAny ideas This is especially frustrating since Oracle intends to fix the TrustedLibrary issue anyway, so putting all this investigative work into this may be doing nothing more than wasting my weekend. Grrr....p  pstrongEDITstrong One observation I had was that first jar that ran into the security exception actually had a dependency on a different jar in my app. I thought, maybe the dependent jars manifest should be read in first So I forced the loadorder so that nondependent jars would be loaded first. End result I could see the nondependent jar now threw the security exception first... and there is still a warning.p

I think it has to do with where the sqlite3step is placed.p  pBut I also want some other eyes to look over my code and let me know if I am doing things correctly I could not find an example doing this anywhere so it is a jumble of about six forums posts and Stack Overflow topics I found on the various subjectsp  precodePlanet Data  Delete previous save data dDataGeneratedPlanets, bErrors  if plData.size gt 0      sqlite3execdBase, BEGIN TRANSACTION, NULL, NULL, amperror      sqlStr  Insert Into GeneratedPlanets ID, Name, Affiliation, Disposition, Race, PlayerOwned, IsDestroyed, EKS, PlanetSize, CurrentPop, MaxPop Values ,,,,,,,,,,      if sqlite3preparev2dBase, sqlStr.cstr, sqlStr.size, ampstatement, 0  SQLITEOK              cout ltlt Saving planet data         Save new data         for i  0 i lt plData.size i                      if i  plData.size                              finalizestatement, bErrors                           else                              sqlI1  plData.ati.pID                 sqlS1  plData.ati.pName                 sqlS2  plData.ati.pAffiliation                 sqlS3  plData.ati.pDispo                 sqlS4  plData.ati.pRace                 sqlI2  plData.ati.bIsPOwned                 sqlI3  plData.ati.bIsDestroyed                 sqlF1  plData.ati.pEKS                 sqlF2  plData.ati.pSize                 sqlLLI1  plData.ati.pCPop                 sqlLLI2  plData.ati.pMPop                  find                   temp                    foundAt  sqlS1.findfind                  if foundAt  stringnpos                                      sqlS1.replacefoundAt,1,temp                                   Bind parameters                 sqlite3bindintstatement,1,sqlI1                 sqlite3bindtextstatement,2,sqlS1.cstr,sqlS1.size,SQLITETRANSIENT                 sqlite3bindtextstatement,3,sqlS2.cstr,sqlS2.size,SQLITETRANSIENT                 sqlite3bindtextstatement,4,sqlS3.cstr,sqlS3.size,SQLITETRANSIENT                 sqlite3bindtextstatement,5,sqlS4.cstr,sqlS4.size,SQLITETRANSIENT                 sqlite3bindintstatement,6,sqlI2                 sqlite3bindintstatement,7,sqlI3                 sqlite3binddoublestatement,8,sqlF1                 sqlite3binddoublestatement,9,sqlF2                 sqlite3bindint64statement,10,sqlLLI1                 sqlite3bindint64statement,11,sqlLLI2                  sqlite3stepstatement                  cout ltlt .                                        else              bErrors  true         createBInfo               d.createBReportSQL Code 2,sqlite3errmsgdBase,bLocale  tostringLINE,bTDate,.SCLog.txt               sqlite3execdBase, END TRANSACTION, NULL, NULL, amperror      sFlagsTemp.pushbacksaveFlag     sFlagsTemp.atsFlagsTemp.size1.sfName  GPlanets     sFlagsTemp.atsFlagsTemp.size1.sfValue  1     cout ltlt Done ltlt endl ltlt endl  codepre

Negative 9132 pIm currently deciding between two different approaches for generating HTML with event handlers.  I know both approaches are viable Ive seen both used before, but Im unclear on their respective advantages, and since Ill be stuck with whichever one I pick I was hoping someone might be able to clarify those advantages for me.p  pHeres a simplistic example to explain the idea although my real world cases will of course be more complex.  Lets say we want to have a button that alerts Hello Bob.  The first approach is to use our view logic to generate the HTML, and then rely on a separate, highlevel event handlerp  precodebody.appendltbutton classnameAlert datanameBobgtClick meltbuttongt  body.onclick .nameAlert, functione      alertHello   e.target.dataname  codepre  pThe second approach is to build an element object, bind a handler to it, and then append it to the DOM, all at oncep  precodevar button  ltbuttongtClick meltbutton var name  Bob button.onclick, functione      alertHello   name  body.appendbutton codepre  pThere are some obvious advantages to the latter approach eg. no writing data attributes, all the logic is one place but Im really curious about the nonobvious advantages eg. the first version will perform better if we wind up with a lot of these buttons on the page.  Im strongespeciallystrong interested in maintainability that should be a programmers first priority, right.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 9132 pIn C with passbyvalue, the caller constructs the copy, which the callee uses. In x64 ABI, some arguments are passed in registers. Registers dont have addresses.p  pSo suppose I have the following classp  precodeclass SelfPointer      SelfPointer self     SelfPointer  selfthis   codepre  pOn construction, it takes a pointer to itself. And now I have this functionp  precodefSelfPointer x  codepre  pcodefcode takes a SelfPointer by value, passed in a register by the calling convention. A caller of codefcode would have to create a copy in a register. Thus, the caller would run the constructor on a SelfPointer located in a register. However, registers dont have addresses, so it would be impossible to run the constructor. How is this dilemma resolvedp  pNote the definition of the class is wrong and needs to have a copy ctor instead of a ctor. See Steve Jessops answer for details.p

Negative 9132 pI followed this first comment,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10889747magentocategorynameandimageinstaticblock1089404310894043magento  category name and image in static blocka to create a simple widget to display the category image and title from a static block on a CMS page. It works fine on my local MAMP version of Magento Enterprise 1.13.0.2. Its not working however on the stage  test environment Magento 1.13.1.0. ubuntu.p  pIt doesnt error, its as though its ignoring the template file info.phtml. When I reverted to the default theme I realised I had to copy the template files to the default enterprise folder to get it to work but it did local version. I have made sure that the template folders are in each of the themes, base, enterprise default, MyTheme default which is enterprise default amp MyTheme  MyThemeVariant.p  pThe only setting  configuration that appears to be different between the local and the stage is that pretty urls arent working on the local. I have looked into the htaccess and it still isnt resolved. On both versions the native Category link Widget isnt working but im not sure if that is relevant.p  pI have disabled any extensions turned the cache off and cleared the index. Still nothing.p  pI have been looking for the answer, retracing my steps, altering and changing back any settings I think may be relevant for 3 days now so im well stuck.

Negative 9132 pI have codeUIViewcodes alpha set at .5, and its border color alpha is .5 as well, they are a similar shade of gray, but it shows up as a thicker gray on the outside.  I am guessing this is because the two colors are being mixed together.  Is there a way that instead of just adding a border on top, I can add a border that will displace the pixels underneath itp

Negative 9132 pThis may have been answered somewhere on the web but Ive looked at lots of the examples and I still cant figure it out.p  pI have a sync based service layer boundary e.g. ProcessOrder method. Within this method it performs various functions, a couple of which have async overloads and it makes sense to use these as they wrap IO bound functions.p  pHowever, my confusion is twofold. From what Ive readp  ul liasync code should be async all the way downli liasync marked methods should not return void  this is an edge case for event handlers andbr doesnt handle bubbling up exceptionsli ul  pSo, with example code such as below NB publisher is wrapper for Azure QueueClient that has Async Send methodsp  precodepublic void ProcessOrder       other stuff...      publisher.PublishAsyncnew ItemOrderedEvent              MessageId  Guid.NewGuid,         IsDurable  true,     .Wait  codepre  pDoesnt seem to fit the async all the way down rule, and there are warnings about deadlocks etc. on the web due to thread pool exhaustion at high loads about this pattern, but code such asp  precodepublic async void ProcessOrder       other stuff...     await  publisher.PublishAsyncnew ItemOrderedEvent              MessageId  Guid.NewGuid,         IsDurable  true,       codepre  pBreaks the async marked methods should not return void rule and will not handle exceptions as, from my understanding, there is no Task context to bubble them back from the async method. NB This is a service boundary  the calling code may be UI, in response to an MSMQ message, a web service call etc. so I do not want implementation of the service call to leak higher up. In the current context, IMO, it makes sense for this to be a sync call only.p  pThe publisher method is defined asp  precodepublic async Task PublishAsyncIMessageBusMessage message       do azure stuff     var queue  QueueClient.CreateFromConnectionStringconnectionString, ItemOrdered     await queue.SendAsyncmessage  codepre  pSo my question is... how the heck do you make use of legitimate IO bound async methods within a sync based architecture The typical answer seems to be you cant as suggested by this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23022573callingasyncmethodsfromasynchronouscontextCalling async methods from a synchronous contexta but then I must be missing something as it seems perfectly reasonable to want to offload IO bound work and let the current thread do some other work, in contexts that are not UI based.p

Negative 9132 pIm currently using OpenCVs ORB features extractor and I did notice the strange at least for me way the ORBdescriptor is stored it is basically a BRIEF32 with a modification that is not relevant to my question. As some of you know ORB takes the keypoints extracted using a modified FAST9 circle radius  9 pixels also stores orientation of the keypoint and uses those with a modified BRIEF32 descriptor to store the feature that the keypoint represents.p  pBRIEF ORB version works as follows we take a 31x31 pixels patch represents a feature and create a bunch of random 5x5 pixels test points. Then we take pairs of those points and evaluate their intensities resulting in a binary decision 0 or 1 based on whether the intensity of the first point in the pair is greater or smaller equal than the intensity of the second one. Then we take all those bits and use a basic sumformula to build a binary string of length n for BRIEF32 we have 32 bytes  8  256 bit long binary stringp  pSUM2supi1supbitpairtestp  pwhere the bitpairtest is the bit value that weve calculated from the test for a pair of test points. The final result is something like for a set of binary tests ...,0,1,0,1,1p  p2sup0sup1  2sup1sup1  2sup2sup0  2sup3sup1  2sup4sup0  ...p  pNow the way OpenCVs ORB stores those bitstrings is what is a mystery to me. If we look at the matrix that contains the descriptors for a whole image with each row being a single descriptor for a single keypoint we can see that each descriptor has 32 8bit numbers, which altogether results in those 256 bits  that BRIEF32 uses to store the information. strongI dont understand why we split those 256 bits in 32 bytesstrong. The official documentation a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkdocpytutorialspyfeature2dpybriefpybrief.html relnofollowhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkdocpytutorialspyfeature2dpybriefpybrief.htmla only says that OpenCV stores such descriptors in bytes, however it does not explain why it does that. Ive considered three possibilities without excluding the possibility that some combination of those might be the answerp  ul liSome storage technique that I just cant seeli liSome performance issue with computing Hamming distance for binary string that long 256 bits in our caseli liOptimization on the matching process  the matching basically compares the descriptor of a keypoint from one image to the descriptor of a keypoint in a second image. Because we have binary strings Hamming distance is the obvious choice here. It might be that somehow each of those 32 substrings is compared to their counterparts in the descriptor of the other keypoint in the second image substring at position 0 keypoint X, image 1 with substring at position 0 keypoint Y, image 2. Finally it might be that OpenCV says Okay, we have 80 match rate of the descriptor since approx. 26 of all substring are the same in both descriptors so we have a winner. How ever I was unable to found any evidence to confirm that.li ul  pPS You can read the paper on ORB at a hrefhttpwww.vision.cs.chubu.ac.jpCVRpdfRubleeiccv2011.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.vision.cs.chubu.ac.jpCVRpdfRubleeiccv2011.pdfa and the paper on BRIEF at a hrefhttpcvlabwww.epfl.chlepetitpaperscalondereccv10.pdf relnofollowhttpcvlabwww.epfl.chlepetitpaperscalondereccv10.pdfap

Negative 9132 pIve been experimenting with ES6 generators in Node now for a little while, and theres still one issue that I dont understand.p  pIn regular callback Node, getting a value from a database and doing something else in parallel would look something like thisp  precodefunction executeBoth    db.findvalue, functionresults     console.logresults       doSomethingElseelse, functiondata     console.logdata     codepre  pThis example is totally contrived, but notice that by calling codeexecuteBothcode, codedb.findcode and codedoSomethingElsecode do not wait for each other to finish and Node can just execute both around the same time and the code is nonblocking.p  pHere is a generator example that would attempt to do the same thingp  precodefunction executeBoth    var results  yield db.findvalue   console.logresults    var data  yield doSomethingElseelse   console.logdata  codepre  pI dont understand how the above code avoids the first function from blocking the second. From what Ive read sources below, it seems that the entire generator suspends when it reaches the codeyieldcode keyword. This makes sense for the lines of code that rely on the value returned from that specific codeyieldcode, but doesnt this also mean that codedb.findcode would block codedoSomethingElsecode from executingp  pIt seems like it can be solved by wrapping each codeyieldcodeed value and the following code that relies on them in their own separate generators, then calling those generators from a normal function. Yet if this the most efficient way to create nonblocking code, it would encourage the overusage of many small generator functions with potentially repeating, specialized code. Am I correctly understanding the underlying mechanics of generators If so, what is the workaround for this Thanks in advance.p  pa hrefhttpluisvega.me20140224understandingnodegenerators relnofollowsource onea, a hrefhttpjlongster.com20121005javascriptyield.html relnofollowsource twoa, a hrefhttpwww.sitepoint.comjavascriptgeneratorspreventingcallbackhell relnofollowsource threeap

The only thing I can think of is that the model that is trying to be added also has the same name and Administration.p  pI hope anyone knows a solution to this nagging problem.

Negative 9132 pI have implemented a class including methods which is not supported by builtin Java. However, after some time, this class has become quite large.  Since it includes independent methods like codeprintMapContainer and splitMapContainercode, I thought I should divide class into two or more different, logical, sub classes and add some hierarchy. But, I dont know how to split below class because they dont fit to an codeinheritancecode sort of problem.

Negative 9132 pI need an efficient way of fetching booleans from a texture with openGL. The boolean array will be a huge 3D array, I cant afford wasted space, meaning I cant afford to encode booleans into 1 byte each. p  pRight now my solution is to encode it into a 1D buffer texture consisting of integers. Using bitwise operations in the shader, i can fetch booleans.p  pTheres two performance eating problems with my solution. The index I calculate for the boolean is naturally a 3d coordinate, which means if I want to be efficient and take advantage of hardware, I should use a 3D texture to cut the performance penalty of the 3D  1D index conversion am I  correct in thinking thisp  pThe other problem, not as bad as the above one, is decoding the boolean from the integer fetch.p  pI notice that if i encode the booleans inside of a 3D texture, I would have to do a different but still as costly 3D  1D index conversion anyway strongbecause storing bits inside of an integer is 1D anywaystrong. Basically, it would be like each texel storing a cube of booleans, which you index with a 1D coordinate. Therefore I dont appear to be gaining any performance because of the need to decode things from the 3D texture also.p  pIs my current solution the best option or is there something better Im wondering if any openGL supported compressed image formats would be of use herep

Negative 9132 pI am new to AndroidJava and hoping to get some help on a modification I am trying to make to sample code. I found an example for how to make a simple TCPIP Client here a hrefhttpandroider.blogspot.com201402androidsercerclientexampleclient.html relnofollowhttpandroider.blogspot.com201402androidsercerclientexampleclient.htmla. It works like a charm and I am able to establish a connection with the server. I am trying to modify the code to add buttons that can disconnect from the server, send a data, and display data coming in. p  pI am having trouble with the first modification where pressing the Disconnect Clear in the example button should disconnect the client on my app from the server. Rooting around the code, I figure I will need to use the socket.close command. My problem is that the socket is being created in the onClick for the Connect button and I believe I need to link the socket.close command in the onClick for the Disconnect button to that. How would I go about this Do I place a reference to it in the onClick method for Disconnect button Alternatively, do I place the whole onClick for the Disconnect button inside the onClick for the COnnect button so it would recognize the socket reference Is it just as simple as getting the onClick for Disconnect out of the onCreate Finally, is there a fourth way to do this that I am not even seeing  p  pI realize how basic these questions are but, as I mentioned, I am new to Android and Java so am just trying to move through my first app with advice from the community. The good news is I think that if I can get a grasp on this button and how to reference the socket being created, the others will be much easier to navigate.

Negative 9132 pI have an MVC PHP application based on Zend Framework.  The M includes a Service Layer which wraps a Domain Model.  The domain model does not strictly follow DDD, but is probably not too far off.  I also have a Mapper layer, though I dont think that is relevant for the sake of this question.p  pMy question is, where does the Current User fit  Is it part of my Domain Model  Or part of the Service Layer.p  pCurrently my Domain Model has all kinds of objects, most of which correlate to something in the real world.  I have Users, Organisations, Countries, Industries, etc...  In addition to these obvious objects I also have what I call the Auth object.  It composes a Session object an instance of ZendSession and also a User object representing the currently logged in user, obviously.p  pMy Auth object has all sorts of helpful methods like codelogin, logout, isLoggedIn, isAdmin, isOwnerOfBusinessbusId, isEmployeeOfBusinessbusIdcode, etc.  It seems to work OK, and is easy enough to test, but its different to the other objects in that it stores the state between requests.  So where does it belongp  pTo me it doesnt feel a perfect fit with either the domain model or the service layer, but it does feel more natural in the domain model.p

Negative 9132 pHow do you get the raw descriptor data from a HID device in Windowsp  pBackgroundp  pI need to get the Manufacturer, Product Name, and Serial Number from a HID device in Windows.

However, I KNOW these devices do have the string information in their descriptors because I am able to see it a hrefhttpwww.uwesieber.deusbtreeviewe.html relnofollowusing USBTreeViewa.p  pThe interesting thing is, even for the devices that do return manufacturer and product names, the values Im getting through hid.dll are very different from the values I see using the above tool which gets the raw data from the USB device.p  pFor example, an Xbox 360 controllerp  precodeVia USB Tree View Device Description        Xbox 360 Controller for Windows Language 0x0409           Microsoft Corporation iProduct                  0x02 Language 0x0409           Controller iSerialNumber             0x03 Language 0x0409           0843806  Via hid.dll using HidDGetManufacturerString, HidDGetProductString, and HidDGetSerialNumberString Description               HIDcompliant game controller Product                   Controller XBOX 360 Controller for Windows Manufacturer              FAILS Serial Number             FAILS codepre  pWinUSB is unable to open these devices at all to retrieve this data as they do not use the winusb.sys driver.p  p1 I dont understand why the values returned by the HidD functions do not match the values in the USB descriptor. 2 I cant find any way to access the raw USB descriptor data for a HID device because I cannot access them with WinUSB.p  hr  pEdit 1p  pOkay, so Ive learned a bit more about HID. It seems the data Im getting through hid.dll is driverspecified data, not data coming from the USB device. HID can apply to devices on transports other than USB as well. So thats fine. Ultimately, what I really want to know is how can I get the USB device when I have the HID device and what API do I use for that. Besides WinUSB which doesnt work, the only thing I can find are kernellevel functions IOCTL. I dont know if thats suitable for a normal, non admin application.p

Negative 9132 pWhat do I have to do to allow multiple concurrents IOCTL request in a WDF driver.p  pIm porting a NT style device driver for a simple PCI IO adapter that provides a memory memory mapped address space to a local bus register interface on a piece of externmal equipment. The device also provides an interrupt source to the application indicating status changes and events.p  pThe old driver provided a IOCTL interface to the application that  a. provided a userspace mapped addressspace for the local bus to the application code  b. an IOCTL call to get the status of the next interrupt eventp  pFor the new driver I prefer not to export a userspace mapped address range to the application, but rather serve the readregister and writeregister operations with individual IOCTL calls, however I can not figure out how to allow the driver to process multiple IOCTLs at one time, so that one application thread can wait on the IOCTL call return that provides the next interrupt status and an other thread can still read and write from the register interface. p  pI expected, that if I create a second manual queue for the get interrupt request and forward all the getnextInterrupt request from the default queue to it, I would be able to start a read or write register IOCTL call in an other thread right away while the getnextinterrupt request is pending in the manual dispatch queue. p  pI found out that this is not so, as all IOCTL calls to the driver are blocking until the getnextinterrupt call is being completed. p  pI tried SynchronizationScopeQueue on both the device and the queue objects as well as setting the default queue where all the IOCTLs arrive to parallel mode, without any effect. No matter what I tried, the IOCTls remain serialized. p  pThanks Gary p

As far as I know, I always have to identify the active textfield first in order to scroll the view to a position, where the textfield wont be covered by the keyboard. So Ive defined a classwide variable codeactiveTextField UITextFieldcode which is set to the current textfield within codetextFieldDidBeginEditingtextField UITextFieldcode. em1 I have to admit that this has been just a lucky workaround as the latter method is called before codekeyboardWillShowsender NSNotificationcode so I can make use of the codeactiveTextFieldcodeother solutionsem. In the mentioned keyboardmethod I put the followingp  precodescrollView.setContentOffsetCGPointMakecontentOffsetBefore.x, activeTextField.superview.superview.frame.origin.y  28.0, animated true codepre  pSo right now every textfield gets scrolled to the same position within the screen later I want to include another check whether it is actually necessary to scroll the view but this is not a big thing. p  pLets say I want the view to be scrolled back to its previous position. I could save the current contentOffset within the codetextFieldDidBeginEditingcode but as soon as the user goes to another textfield directly  lets assume he stays in the same row at least  by clicking or tapping the Nextbutton, the codecurrentContentOffsetcode will be overridden again but this time with the new, already offset view value so this approach doesnt work. I couldnt find a place to flag anything either since although the scrollView doesnt change position when switching textfields directly, all other methods are called including keyboardDidHide though it never DID visibly hide  so no spot to put a flag when to rewrite codecurrentContentOffsetcode and when not to.p  pAll this looks like a bit of a mess to me anyway, so does anyone know what practices work and are commonly used by developers In the end I just aim for a smooth user experience in a case where dynamic rows exist with several textfields each. Thanks for sharing your knowledgep
Negative 9132 pIve got a linear type family, i.e. of the formp  precodetype family Foo a type instance Foo T1  T2 type instance Foo T2  T3 ... type instance Foo T9  T10 codepre  pIn my particualr usecase, it is very convenient to define the reverse family codeFooRevcode and then enforce the constraint codeFooRev Foo x  xcodep  precodetype family FooRev a type instance FooRev T10  T9 type instance FooRev T9  T8 ... type instance FooRev T2  T1 codepre  pThe reverse family allows GHC to infer many types that would otherwise be ambiguous due to noninjectivity. It is essentially the same idea that was proposed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16927632925978herea. This solution works pretty well, but it is annoying, programatic, and errorprone to have to define a reverse type family by listing out all the cases. Is there a more generic way to define the reverse of a linear family such as codeFoocode p

Negative 9132 pIm currently studying dynamic programming solutions to Markov Decision Processes. I feel like Ive got a decent grip on VI and PI and the motivation for PI is pretty clear to me converging on the correct state utilities seems like unnecessary work when all we need is the correct policy. However, none of my experiments show PI in a favourable light in terms of runtime. It seems to consistently take longer regardless of the size of the state space and discount factor. p  pThis could be due the implementation  Im using the a hrefhttpburlap.cs.brown.edu relnofollowBURLAPa library, or poor experimentation on my part. However, even the trends dont seem to show a benefit. It should be noted that the BURLAP implementation of PI is actually modified policy iteration which runs a limited VI variant at each iteration. My question to you is do you know of any situations, theoretical or practical, in which modified PI should outperform VIp

Like if user click on product1 than images already in base64 will be attached to the html  tag as shown belowp  precodefor var i  startIndex i lt endIndex i              aImage[imgIndex]  new Image             aImage[imgIndex].src  loadImagei              img.images.pushaImage[imgIndex]             imgIndex  1           imgFront.responsive  true imgFront.speed  0.3 imgFront.frames  imgIndex1 imgFront.reel codepre  pnow, the problem is  the images which I am loading for dataimages is displayed very big in size zoom x4, which obviously does not fit in my img control, but when I use the same base64 image code for displaying directly in img control i.e.  it displayed proper without zooming. Also when I applying these base64images directly in dataimages, it display properly without any zooming.p  palso, after the .reel command the picture doesnt start rotating... like it is starting automatically when page loading.p  pSomeone, please help me urgently...p
Negative 9132 pI recently ported a heavy page to React. Ive kept the html almost identical. The main difference being that, earlier, the server rendered html was directly given to the browser and now, the react rewrite pulls json via a  server side API and uses React to manage the DOM.p  pIve seen heap snapshots for the earlier implementation going up to strong55 MBsstrong. For the same data, the heap snapshot for the React.js implementation comes to around strong100 MBsstrongalmost doublep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVXmjL.png altChrome dev tools heap snapshot screenshotp  pI understand that the json data held in memory will contribute to some increase in the memory consumed. But, when I examined the heap snapshot, I see that around 60 of the retained size is due to some objects whose retaining path contain strongdeleteAllListeners  ....  unmountComponentAtNodestrong . I am trying to understand what that means in terms of reducing the memory used.p  pAlso, could the strongdatareactidstrong attributes added by React to the DOM contribute to a nonnegligible  increase in memory consumption p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28435915getinitialstateclonepropsThis questiona has some more details that might help.p
Negative 9132 pI have a codeListltCollidergt colliderscode which is for a tile map.p  pOne approach that I thought of is to check the full list for all colliders positions, compare to players position, then add closest colliders to a temporary list for faster iteration. Only doing this once every 100ms would decrease performance loss. But Id imagine there are better ways than this, rightp  pIve read a different post on here for collision optimization, and it mentioned using a CPU Budget, which I intend to implement for this and others as well. I have not read about threading yet.p  pShorter question strongHow can I limit the maximum iterations to only the colliders closest to playerstrongp
Negative 9132 pIm currently building a web app for competence analysis based on bibliographic data together with a friend. The project is based on DjangoPython and MongoDB. We use MongoEngine for communication with the database. p  pMy current objective is to import the data set provided by a hrefhttpdblp.unitrier.de relnofollowdblpa into our database. The data is provided as one XML file approx. 1,5 GB. The parsing is done using lxmls iterparse, which works really well, but I cant simply import all data as is. The authors are provided as strings in every object, but we need them as separate objects.br That means I have to extract the authors for each entry, check if there is already a person with that name in the database and create it if it doesnt exist. This means that for every author we need 1 to 2 queries one for checking if the author exists and one for inserting if it doesnt exist.br I think that this is the main reason for our huge performance problems regarding the import we are speaking of 189k publications and 247k authors in about 20 hours. My current idea is to create a certain amount of objects an then inserting them into the database, but obviously not checking if authorspublications already exist will result in duplicate entries.  p  pSimplified classes representing publications, authors and the manytomany relationship between publications and authorsp  precodefrom mongoengine import Document, StringField, ListField, IntField, DateTimeField, ReferenceField   class PublicationDocument     title  StringFieldrequiredTrue, uniquewith[dblpkey]     tags  ListFieldrequiredFalse      meta           allowinheritance True,         indexes [                              fields [title]             ,         ]       class PersonDocument     name  StringFieldrequiredTrue      meta           allowinheritance True,         indexes [                              fields [name]                      ]        class PublicationToPersonDocument     role  StringFieldrequiredTrue, uniquewith[publication, person]     publication  ReferenceFielddocumenttypePublication, requiredTrue     person  ReferenceFielddocumenttypePerson, requiredTrue codepre  pCould it be that defining the indexes in the model is responsible for the miserable performance Another problem I have is that the import and the MongoDB server are running on one PC RAM 8 GB, CPU AMD Phenom II X6 1090T. Could this be affecting the performance I honestly am out if ideas on how to do this import without it taking days. p  pstrongTLDRstrong Do you have any tips regarding the time efficient import of XML files containing objects that reference each other into MongoDB According to the source of the data dblp there are 2,881,343 publications and 1,525,458 authors inside of the dataset.p

The first seekbar has a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 180 while the second seekbar has a minimum of 180 and a maximum of 400.

Negative 9132 pIn my XSLT stylesheet I wish to assign an XML document object to a global variable. The name of the XML document varies so the assignment should be conditional. The names of the different XML documents are as follows screenlabels0.xml, screenlabels1.xml, etc. The number in these names is equal to the value of a parameter uilanguage passed to the stylesheet. As long as I hard code the assignment as follows, this works finep  precodeltxslvariable namescreenlabels selectdocument..xsltscreenlabels1.xmlgt codepre  pLater in the stylesheet I can address nodes from this object via an Xpath starting with screenlabels no need to apply nodeset to it. Any attempt to condionalize this has failed so far.  First I notice that the following code apparently is not equal to the single line of code abovep  precode  ltxslvariable namescreenlabelsgt     ltxslvalueof selectdocument..xsltscreenlabels1.xmlgt   ltxslvariablegt codepre  pIt seems I cannot address this variable the same way, nor after applying nodeset to it. Changing valueof to copyof doesnt seem to help either. A conditional variant to the above using a choose construction then doesnt work either of course. My alternative approach to simply use the uilanguage parameter in the singleline assignment, like below, didnt work either. Anyone any ideas how to do this or have I been sloppy in my testing Your help would be appreciated greatly.p  precodeltxslvariable namescreenlabels selectdocument..xsltscreenlabelsuilanguage.xmlgt codepre

While i know most NoSQL solutions have secondary indexes doesnt this type of querying ability severely limit how many solutions NoSQL is relevant for I usually need this rich querying ability. Another good example would be a bug tracking application. p  pI dont think you want to kick off a map reduce job every time wants to search the database i think this would be analogous to doing table scans most of the time in a traditional relational model. So i would assume there would be a lot of queries where you would have to loop through each entity and look for the criteria you wanted to search for which would probably be slow. I understand you can run nightly map reduce jobs to either analyze the data or to maybe normalize it into a typical relational database structure for reports.p  pNow i can see it being useful for scenarios where you would most likely always have to read all the data anyways. Think of a web server log or maybe an IoT type of app where your collecting massive amounts of data like censor collection and doing nightly analysis.p  pSo is understanding of NoSQL off or is there a limit to the  of scenarios that i works well withp

Negative 9132 pI working with codeRailscode and codePostgresqlcode and Im trying to query my postgres db based on the value of a column. p  pTo put it into perspective, I have an codeEventscode table in postgres and in that table I have some events that are recurring and some that arent based on the column value of coderepeatscode.p  pIf the events recur, then they will have a value of codedailycode, codeweeklycode, codemonthlycode, etc. inside of the coderepeatscode column.  Obviously, if it doesnt recur then the value will be set to codenullcode.p  pI would like to receive only those events that recur in the coderepeatscode column.

Negative 9132 pIm trying to save codegobcodeencoded data in a file on disk as a simple datastore. However, when I open it next time the gob encoder just ignores whatever data is already in the file, and starts over sending definitions of already sent formats before sending data. Seeing that codegob.Encodercode takes an codeio.Writercode, rather than an codeio.ReadWritercode, this makes sense. The encoder has no idea whats in the file, because it cannot read from it.p  pThis is, however, quite inefficient. Its also unnecessarily hard to parse, since you have to reset the decoder each time the encoder restarted when writing to the file, since the gob type ids mightve changed.p  pHow can I continue to write to the end of a file containing gob data Do I have to create a new file, moving all data over so the gob encoder knows what types it already sent, or is there a way for me to tell the encoder what types it should know about already, or some other way I need it to work across software restarts.p

Negative 9132 pI feel that the issue Im having is due to how things are suppose to be configured which Im not sure of how that is to be.p  pWhen running an executable .jar file on our dev systems we are setting via System.setProperty the location of the keystore and truststore. This works as we are able to communicate to the database server and get the data.p  pWhen running an executable .jar file on our production systems we are NOT able to set via System.setProperty the location of the keystore and truststore. This is apparent when debugging is on and shows 1. Nothing for our keystore and 2. The wrong location for the truststore so we are NOT able to communicate to the database server.p  pI have been trying to set the value via the java code as well as passing the values on the call to the jar itself, i.e. codejava jar Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorepathkeystorecode etc.p  pCan someone provide any possible things I should be looking into Ive also been looking into the java.policy and java.security files but both have virtually nothing in them and we have nobody in house to go to for an answer.p  p update  On the production system using the debug there is nothing set for the keystore location and the truststore path appears to be pointing to some other location.p
Negative 9132 pI am struggling to get my head around a clean way to have strongly typed reusable form fields or question types in MVC.p  pThe idea is that I want a number of reusable question types that can be dropped in multiple Views and just have values passed to them to render the field correctly.p  pFor example, I would have one DropdownMenu partial that I can render in my View every time I need a dropdown menu and pass it the option values etc that it needs to render the individual question.p  pThe problem is, I want to take advantage of MVCs Model binding and validation using HTML Helpers to render the fields. This is fine, but when trying to put this into a Partial View to be reused, I need the model property bound to the field to be dynamic. The issue with Partials is that they either inherit the parent Views Model or a Model that you specify but this means they can only be used for that property.p  pSay I have a ViewModel that has a property called TestQuestion and I want to render a textbox menu for it. I have a Partial called TextBox and in this there is a field likep  precodeHtml.TextBoxForm gt m.TestQuestion codepre  pThis will work fine for this question, but if I want to use TextBox for another property such as TestQuestionTwo, m  m.TestQuestion will not work. How do I give it dynamic properties to render using Html helpersp  pIs this possible with Partial Views or should I be using EditorTemplates I tried looking into this but cant get my head around whether they can support it either.p  pThanks in advance,p  pAaronp

Negative 9132 pThis is not really a question as I have already resolved my problem.  I am just passing along what I found and what I did about it.p  pMySQL allows parameter SQLMODE to be set to multiple values in the my.cnf file.  However, Amazon RDS allows only one value, whether you use their browserbased console or their CLI tools.p  pI have found a perhaps not perfect solution to the problem of not being able to set SQLMODE to multiple values. In my procedure below, I show what my settings are. You may choose whatever values you think are pertinent to your environment.p  p1 In your parm group, set SQLMODE  TRADITIONAL or which ever one value is your highest priorityp  p2 In your parm group, set initconnect to SET SESSION sqlmode  TRADITIONAL,IGNORESPACE,NOENGINESUBSTITUTION,ONLYFULLGROUPBYp  pNow when a client logs into the database, their session SQLMODE should be set to all values passed in by the initconnect string. In my case, this equates to IGNORESPACE, ONLYFULLGROUPBY, STRICTTRANSTABLES, STRICTALLTABLES, NOZEROINDATE, NOZERODATE, ERRORFORDIVISIONBYZERO, TRADITIONAL, NOAUTOCREATEUSER, NOENGINESUBSTITUTIONp  pCaveat Editing the initconnect value after setting it involved cutnpaste.  However, I found that trying to delete an initconnect value after setting it is a big hassle, so be careful in working with it. The hassle To delete an initconnect value after setting it required that I create a new parm group from scratch, set all values except initconnect to what the original parm group had, delete the original parm group, then rename the new group with the old name.  This was true with both Firefox and Chrome.  I also could not delete the value using the CLI tool aws rds modifydbparametergroup.p  pAlthough not really part of this post, if anyone responds with how to deleteresetnullout initconnect without the kind of hassle I describe above, that would be great.p  pUPDATEp  pNever mind.  I have discovered that an initconnect setting on RDS will NOT survive a database reboot. Therefore, the solution I offered above does not work.p  pAlso, since one cannot remove delete an initconnect setting through the console why not, one can remove it by using the strongaws rds resetdbparametergroupstrong CLI command rather than rebuilding the whole parameter group like I described before.p  pI am VERY disappointed that Amazon RDSp  ul liDoes not allow multiple SQLMODE values.li liDoes not allow us to delete an initconnect setting through the console.li ul

Negative 9132 pIve done some Googling for each of my issues but havent found exactly the results as I wanted. Things I need to be done doesnt probably include any macrosVBA skills, just basic knowledge of Excel.p  pNow to my spreadsheet. Im a Dota 2 player and I like statistics. I like it that much that Id like to keep track of my achievements and results. Only problem is that the game tracker sucks and to get great information in web you have to pay for it, so I decided its time for me to create my own spreadsheet to track my skills.p  pI dont know which place is the best to share my spreadsheet but I uploaded it to Estonian uploading host, link is a hrefhttpwww.upload.eefiles4804247coolerMMR.xlsx.html relnofollowherea. I will also provide with pictures so you dont have to download anything.p  pThis is what it looks like in generalp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHPP2m.png altenter image description herep  pProblem number 1 The left table, or column has 1000 rows. In web design its possible to make elements fixed depending on the scroll, Id like to use similar feature here. If the table gets scrolled down, the right table area with games, bonus and graph will get scrolled down with it.p  pProblem number 2 Average MMR. Id like to show average MMR after each entry depending on the first entries. Right now theres avg MMR for J4J8. The calculation for J8 looks like this codeAVERAGEC4C8code. For J7 it looks like this codeAVERAGEC4C7code. Id like to do this for all my 1000 rows, but I dont want to type it out. If I try to drag down from the corner, it will continue with C5C8, C6C9 etc so it changes the starting pointp  pProblem number 3 Under longestGame theres currently Date and Hero. This should show the Date and Hero of which the longest game occurred. I tried to do this with LOOKUP function but it required table to be in ascending order, which I dont want. For current, 44,22, there should be Storm Spirit and 14.06.2015.p  pProblem number 4 Graph. Id like to display three series on graph  MMR, average MMR and game length time. The problem is, that MMR and average MMR will be in the numbers on 30007000 but the game length will only be probably in timeframe 200012000. Maybe its possible to add two sets of values to the Y axis or maybe set Time series maximum 20000 and minimum 000 and create graph according to this. Im really stupid making graphs and I havent figured out a clever way yet.p  pProblem number 5 Graph again. Right now I have to set the series for the graph. Ive currently set it to C4C54 so 50 rows. Id like it to move around a bit and by that I mean that if there happens to be C55th game then the graph would start from C5C55 and move along so itll count 50 last games. p

Negative 9132 pI am using Xcode 7 Beta 2 on my Mac. I recently downloaded IOS 8.4 on my iPhone 6. IOS 8.4 was the public release strongNOTstrong 8.4 Beta. When I plug in my iPhone into my Mac to download it to my phone, but next to my iPhone section it says emiPhone unavailableem. The deployment target is IOS 8.4. I suspect that this has something to do with the Xcode 7 Beta 2 not being supported with my newly update IOS 8.4 iPhone 6. And I had update a previous version of my app onto my phone when it was running on IOS 8.3. Could someone confirm my belief or help me solve this problem. Thanksp

Negative 9132 pIm trying to recreate the index slider as you see in some apps, most obviously the standard Contacts app in Android. Currently Im generating a list of items, and Im generating a side index that adds a unique alpha letter corresponding to the first letter of each list item. Ive successfully added an codeonClickListenercode to each letter in the sideindex, and Ive tried using an codeonTouchListenercode to them. I feel like I should be using the codeonTouchListenercode on the LinearLayout that holds the entire list, instead of the TextView that holds just a single alpha value, however when I try this I run into errors.p  pThe strongactivitymain.xmlstrong file has a parent LinearLayout, with a ListView and another LinearLayout as children. The ListView displays a list of items, and the child LinearLayout will host an index of of list items. This is supposed to mimic how the Contacts app does theirs strongsideindexitem.xmlstrong just has a single TextView that holds a single letter as an index.
