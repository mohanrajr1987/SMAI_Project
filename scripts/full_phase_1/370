Positive 370 pSo Im writing a Class for an object with several properties that I dont want a user to have to initialize all at once, but all of these attributes are essential to the abstraction and function my class provides i.e. Ideally, a user shouldnt experience an AttributeError. I wrote an stronginitstrong function that accepts these properties as either a dictionary, arguments, or both, and sets any attributes not initialized by the user to None.p  precode class Thing  properties  set[attr1, attr2, attr3, attr4, attr5, somedict, somelist, someotherlist]  def initself, arghash, kwargs        Set allowed attributes from a dict       for dictionary in arghash           for key in dictionary               if key in Thing.properties                   setattrself, key, dictionary[key]        Set allowed attributes from arguments       for key in kwargs           if key in Thing.properties               setattrself, key, kwargs[key]        Set remaining attributes to None       for prop in Thing.properties           if not hasattrself, prop               setattrself, prop, None codepre  pIve done this with a set called properties, which has every attribute I want initialized in each instance of my class. Users cant set attributes that are not in the set, and every property in the set becomes an attribute, even if the value is None. This is more or less the behavior I am looking for, but JediVim does not recognize that these are attributes of each instance, and so autocomplete does not find matches for any of these. p  pIs there an elegant way to get this or similar behavior and have JediVim recognize my attributes Or is there a reason I should not have my class behave this way Any advice would be wonderful, and please let me know if there is a better way to phrase this question or if anything is unclear.p

Positive 370 pIm working on a plugin to allow bracket completion I know its available, its more of a learning exercise.  To properly implement it, I need to add to the backspace mapping.  However, as its an important key, Id rather keep the existing functionality and just add to it rather than reimplementing the functionality.  The steps would basically be when in insert mode and press backspace, execute the original backspace key, then check for some conditions and maybe remove more characters.p  pIve tried something like codeimap ltbackspacegt ltbackspacegtltcallfuncheregtcode, but that doesnt seem to work.

DUSECLANGCOMPLETER,   THIS IS IMPORTANT Without a stdltsomethinggt flag, clang wont know which  language to use when compiling headers. So it will guess. Badly. So C  headers will be compiled as C headers. You dont want that so ALWAYS specify  a stdltsomethinggt.  For a C project, you would set this to something like c99 instead of  c99. stdc99,  ...and the same thing goes for the magic x option which specifies the  language that the files to be compiled are written in. This is mostly  relevant for c headers. x, c, isystem, ..BoostParts, isystem,  This path will only work on OS X, but extra paths that dont exist are not  harmful SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkHeaders, isystem, ..llvminclude, isystem, ..llvmtoolsclanginclude, I, ., I, .ClangCompleter, isystem, .testsgmockgtest, isystem, .testsgmockgtestinclude, isystem, .testsgmock, isystem, .testsgmockinclude, ]    Set this to the absolute path to the folder NOT the file containing the  compilecommands.json file to use that instead of flags.

I have a category2.subcategory4.view file which in theory replaces the index.view file displaying the posts within the subcategory with the formatting of my choosing this part is working.p  pWhat isnt working, and I cant figure out is when I go to localhostcategory2subcategory4post1 to view the post, it is also using the category2.subcategory4.view to try to display the contents of the post. But since the .view file was setup to display a list of posts it isnt going to display properly. What the expected behavior is for it to use post.view to render the post.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpgraffiticms.comoldsupportdesignersmakinguseofviews relnofollowhttpgraffiticms.comoldsupportdesignersmakinguseofviewsa category2.subcategory4.view should override index.view and it doesnt say anything about it overriding post.view.p  pIve tried every naming schema I can think of, and if I change the category it always seems to override my post.view aswell. Any help is appreciated.p
Negative 370 pIve been asked to develop a new application that will work along side the existing one. Both application will wait for a barcode reader input. I dont want our operator to scan a barcode twice once for the existing application 16bit  clipper, no sources and once for the new application. To solves this issue Ive decided to use a lowlevel keyboard hook written in Delphi. It looks perfect since 2 applications will need the barcode reader input and that my application will not be focused the most of the time.p  pMy lowlevel keyboard hook is well working when my application is focused. For example, if I enter into a TEdit control and then if I scan my barcode p  ul lithe awaited characters will be displayed in the TEdit control 0290BDIJ.li lithe lowlevel hook will get all characters  , then 0, then 2 and so on.li ul  pThings are getting worse when my application is no more focused  if I open notepad and then if I scan my barcode p  ul lithe awaited characters will be displayed in notepad 0290BDIJ.li lithe lowlevel hook will get wrongs characters  bdij li ul  pIt looks like the Keyboard state is no taken in account  It looks like the Shift, Ctrl or even Alt keys are no more taken in account.On my french keyboard p  ul li  CTRL  ALT  li li0  SHIFT   li li2  SHIFT  li li...li ul  pDoes anyone now how to solve this problem  Am I doing it the wrong way should I use windows messages instead .

Negative 370 pIve imported a bunch of users into my Active Directory with some custom fields.  Then I did a profile import from Active Directory to Sharepoint with all the custom fields and regular fields.  After this, I needed each user to be in a site collection with a MySite set up for them.  I did that by writing some code that ensured the user existed and then checked the profile attribute personalspace to see if a MySite had been created.  Everything worked great until some of the users needed to login from outside the network.p  pId like to get rid of the windows authentication popup that a user would get if they hit from outside the network or havent added the site to their trusted zone in IE.  Ive extended my web application to create an internet zone.  Then I edited the web.config of the internet site to do active directory forms authentication, along with editing the Central Administrators web.config so that it can see the data source.  This is all well and good, the user can login through a nice interface.  The only problem is that now the user is detached from their user profile.  Essentially Sharepoint views a windows authentication user and a forms authenticated user as two separate users.  p  pIs there a way to link the profiles  Do I have to write a custom membership provider to log a user in and then link them up to their windows account  Is there a way to log a user in from the internet web app and then spoof their windows credentials and pass it to the intranet  Do I need to recreate all the user profiles based on the forms authentication data sourcep

Negative 370 pIm working on the admin section of a site using Kohana. Ive created a admin subfolder within the views folder to store admin views.

At this point, the template file is identical to the template file in the views folder that I successfully used to create much of the front end so its not there. Also, an important fact to note, when I use the template file in the views folder for the front end it loads the page correctly. p  pThat leads me to believe it has something to do with the template file being located in a sub folder. That puzzles me though because I successfully load another view file from the same viewsadmin folder. That file doesnt contain any variables though, so maybe thats why it loads.p  pIve triedp  precode thisgttemplate  Viewfactorythisgttemplate codepre  pTo load the new template file also, but it returns an error that the view must be called before rendering. I think thats due to auto render being on, but I want it on.p  pAny ideas would be a big help. Obviously, I could move the file out of the admin folder and rename it, but thats not really going to help me learn whats going on.p

This results in huge numbers potentially  100k of small queries.p  pOur current approach is to use ActiveMQ with ActiveMessaging.  Each of our users is pushed onto a queue as a different message.  Then, the consumer pulls the user off the queue, queries Salesforce.com, and processes the results.  But this approach gives us horrible performance.  Within a single poller process, we can only process a single user at a time.  So, the Salesforce.com queries become serialized.  Unless we run literally hundreds of poller processes, we cant come anywhere close to saturating the server running poller.p  pWere looking at EventMachine as an alternative.  It has the advantage of allowing us to kickoff large numbers of Salesforce.com queries concurrently within a single EventMachine process.  So, we get great parallelism and utilization of our server.p  pBut there are two problems with EventMachine.  1 We lose the reliable message delivery we had with ActiveMQActiveMessaging.  2 We cant easily restart our EventMachines periodically to lessen the impact of memory growth.  For example, with ActiveMessaging, we have a cron job that restarts the poller once per day, and this can be done without worrying about losing any messages.  But with EventMachine, if we restart the process, we could literally lose hundreds of messages that were in progress.  The only way I can see around this is to build a persistancereliable delivery layer on top of EventMachine.p  pDoes anyone have a better approach  Whats the best way to reliably execute large numbers of asynchronous IObound operationsp

Negative 370 pSo in a recent project a small internal tool, I want to experiment with emnotem using an ORM tool which we typically use in all our projects. The reason is that I particularly arent a fan of them specially in complex projects with complex object hierarchies and relationships. Using an ORM it becomes difficult to debug performance issues and other issues arising from a lot of things that the ORM library might do under the covers to optimize.p  pSo I was thinking of a way to lazy load certain properties of objects when I dont have the help of an ORM tool. Suppose an examplep  precodeclass Student  private ListltCoursegt courses  public ListltCoursegt getCourses ... public void setCoursesListltCoursegt courses ...  codepre  pSo in this case we put courses lazily. So I want a way to differentiate between a scenario in which the courses has not been loaded from the database and when courses is actually null even after fetching from the DB.p  pWhat are the typical ways in which I can achieve it. I was thinking that probably associate a special empty object of type Course denoting that actually no data exists in the DB. And the java emnullem would mean that the data is not fetched from the DB. But this would break abstraction a bit in the sense that the getter for such emlazyem properties need to make the decision to accessing the DAO to getting the data.p
Negative 370 pIm trying to monitor the CPU usage of a process Ive been updating to do a bit more work. However reading the procpidstat file, the jiffie counts of utime,stime, etc of the process will not increase. It is definately doing some work, I can see it with strace etc.p  pThe amount of work the process is doing is relatively tiny reads procstat 10 times per second, does a scanf, a few adddeletes, and updates some shared memory. Is it possible that an amount of work can be so low that it does not manage to increment the jiffie count Does a process have to hold onto the processor for a complete jiffie in order to increment the countp  pAny thoughts would be most appreciatedp  pCheers Joe.p

Negative 370 pWhich Java synchronization construct is likely to provide the best  performance for a concurrent, iterative processing scenario with a fixed number of threads like the one outlined below After experimenting  on my own for a while using ExecutorService and CyclicBarrier and being somewhat surprised by the results, I would be grateful for some  expert advice and maybe some new ideas. Existing questions here do  not seem to focus primarily on performance, hence this new one.  Thanks in advance p  pThe core of the app is a simple iterative data processing algorithm, parallelized to the spread the computational load across 8 cores on a Mac Pro, running OS X 10.6 and Java 1.6.007. The data to be processed is split into 8 blocks and each block is fed to a Runnable to be executed  by one of a fixed number of threads. Parallelizing the algorithm was fairly straightforward, and it functionally works as desired, but its performance is not yet what I think it could be. The app seems to spend a lot of time in system calls synchronizing, so after some profiling I wonder whether I selected the most appropriate synchronization mechanisms.p  pA key requirement of the algorithm is that it needs to proceed in  stages, so the threads need to sync up at the end of each stage.  The main thread prepares the work very low overhead, passes it to  the threads, lets them work on it, then proceeds when all threads  are done, rearranges the work again very low overhead and repeats  the cycle. The machine is dedicated to this task, Garbage Collection is minimized by using perthread pools of preallocated items, and the number of threads can be fixed no incoming requests or the like, just one thread per CPU core.p  h2V1  ExecutorServiceh2  pMy first implementation used an ExecutorService with 8 worker threads. The program creates 8 tasks holding the work and then lets them work on it, roughly like thisp  precode create one thread per CPU executorService  Executors.newFixedThreadPool 8  ...  now process data in cycles while ...       package data into 8 work items     ...       create one Callable task per work item     ...       submit the Callables to the worker threads     executorService.invokeAll taskList   codepre  pThis works well functionally it does what it should, and for very large work items indeed all 8 CPUs become highly loaded, as much as the processing algorithm would be expected to allow some work items will finish faster than others, then idle. However, as the work items become smaller and this is not really under the programs control, the user CPU load shrinks dramaticallyp  precodeblocksize  system  user  cyclessec 256k        1.8    85     1.30 64k         2.5    77     5.6 16k         4      64     22.5 4096        8      56     86 1024       13      38     227 256        17      19     420 64         19      17     948 16         19      13     1626 codepre  pLegend   block size  size of the work item  computational steps   system  system load, as shown in OS X Activity Monitor red bar   user  user load, as shown in OS X Activity Monitor green bar   cyclessec  iterations through the main while loop, more is betterp  pThe primary area of concern here is the high percentage of time spent in the system, which appears to be driven by thread synchronization calls. As expected, for smaller work items, ExecutorService.invokeAll will require relatively more effort to sync up the threads versus the amount of work being performed in each thread. But since ExecutorService is more generic than it would need to be for this use case it can queue tasks for threads if there are more tasks than cores, I though maybe there would be a leaner synchronization construct.p  h2V2  CyclicBarrierh2  pThe next implementation used a CyclicBarrier to sync up the threads before receiving work and after completing it, roughly as followsp  precodemain       create the barrier     barrier  new CyclicBarrier 8  1        create Runable for thread, tell it about the barrier     Runnable task  new WorkerThreadRunnable barrier        start the threads     for int i  0 i lt 8 i                create one thread per core         new Thread task .start           while ...            tell threads about the work         ...           N threads  this will call await, then system proceeds         barrier.await           ... now worker threads work on the work...           wait for worker threads to finish         barrier.await        class WorkerThreadRunnable implements Runnable      CyclicBarrier barrier      WorkerThreadRunnable CyclicBarrier barrier   this.barrier  barrier       public void run              while true                        wait for work             barrier.await               do the work             ...               wait for everyone else to finish             barrier.await                codepre  pAgain, this works well functionally it does what it should, and for very large work items indeed all 8 CPUs become highly loaded, as before.

Negative 370 pI have an opensource application on the Android market.  It seems to work fine for me with over 1,000 active installs, I have to presume that it works for most people.p  pI recently got a a hrefhttpcode.google.companddaavenissuesdetailid21 relnofollowbug reporta that indicated a problem for at least three users on Samsung phones Intercept and Captivate.  I have been unable to reproduce the problem on my ADP2 and on the emulator.p  pIn order to get enough data to diagnose the problem, I first tried to add logging and then I asked users to submit logs via a hrefhttpwww.appbrain.comappcom.xtralogic.android.logcollector relnofollowLog Collectora.  Each time a user tried to send the log there were four attempts, it was truncated and I did not get any useful data.p  pI then added a hrefhttpacra.googlecode.com relnofollowACRAa to the project in an attempt to get information, but I dont seem to be able to automatically detect the bug in order to send a report.p  pSince I dont have a Samsung phone and I cant reproduce it on anything where I could connect with the debugger, I am mostly out of ideas.  The only idea I have left is to add a button to the UI to generate a report.p  pAre there any other approaches to suggestp  pstrongUpdatestrong since people are asking for more specifics essentially, the app reads in text files from the assets and puts them with some preprocessing into a TextView in a ScrollView.  The data is prgressively added to a SpannableStringBuffer and then that is passed to TextViews setText function.  Depending on the options chosen, the text displayed is between 15k115k.  On phones with this issue, only part of the text is displayed.  The cutoff point depends on the options, but seems to be somewhere between 17k18k.p  pACRA sends a report for all uncaught exceptions and puts them into a Google FormSpreadsheet.  Ive gotten reports from my emulator and from my phone, so I know that end works.  Actually, Ive often found it faster to debug from the stack trace in that report than to attach the debugger to the process.p  pPhone specs I have exercised the app on emulators running 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, and 2.2.  My phone is ADP2 the developer version of the MyTouch, but Ive installed a a hrefhttpwww.cyanogenmod.com relnofollowthirdparty ROMa to jump up to Froyo 2.2.  I am unaware of an emulator specifically for the Samsung OS build, although that would be quite helpful here.p  pSince the expected text length is constant, I emshouldem be able to detect if it is read correctly or not.  I added checks at the end of my text processing, but those never triggered, indicating that the problem was not with reading the file.  I then tried adding checks to onPostCreate and onPostResume, but those did not fail either.  It seems that the UI thread had not yet actually run at that point, though.p  pIve now done 6 private APK versions attached to the bug in the bug tracker.  I frankly am surprised that any users are still trying them.  This latest version has a button to force a bug report  that will only be called after the UI thread has laid out the screen.  Hopefully that will give me enough variable information to point me in the right direction.p

Negative 370 pOur project is a content management system supporting several dozen of our websites.  The development group started off small and in one location, and we dealt with a fairly standard codingdeployment strategy.p  pWe coded off of trunk and insisted on a clean trunk.  Every few days we would tag trunk and deploy to the test server.  If all worked out, wed deploy to Production and move on.p  pThat worked well for a while until the team grew.  We frequently faced situations where the revision that was tagged had problems that needed to be fixed before going to Production.  While the developer responsible was working on those fixes, we had other developers committing changes to trunk.  Once the original developers fixes were complete, the new commits that were added would have to go along for the ride, further delaying the build because now theres additional validation that needs to be done.p  pIn an attempt to rectify this, we created a separate trunk used strictly for releases.  People would work in the main trunk, and then ask the project manager or development lead to merge their changes into the release trunk.p  pThis worked for a while until the team got even bigger and more disjoint.  We have teams of 35 people working in 4 geographic locations  some on the same components, others on different components with different priorities and release schedules.  This was pretty much a fulltime job and became a nightmare for the person managing the builds.p  pIn an attempt to work around that, we started creating release branches off of whatever the latest Production tag was.  People would commit to there ONLY what is ready to be tested and go to Production.  Others would commit to trunk until it was their turn to merge.  That took the burden of merging and resolving conflicts off of the build manager and on to the person owning the code.p  pThis worked for about a week until we started having to do several high priority emergency releases.  This effectively  meant that we wouldp  ol liCreate a branch off of the latest Production tagli liAdd the emergency stuff to that branchli liTag that branch and release to Productionli liMerge all of the changes that were made in that branch into the regular release branch that is sitting in QA.li ol  pThis is every day.  Sometimes twice a day.p  pIve tried to relate this a bit to an open source project where there are developers all over the place who dont even know each other and they still seem to get by... but that comparison falls apart when new stable, tested, productionworthy builds are expected for public consumption several times a week or day.  If Firefoxs daily build is a buggy mess, for example, at least users can go back to a previous version or use the latest stable release.  Thats not the case for our users.  If our release is not perfect, they cant work.p  pBackstory completed, I now pose the questionp  pGiven an environment where...p  ol liDevelopers are all over the place and working on different components.li liChanges to some components can wait a week before being released, others cant wait even a day.li liThe application is missioncritical and changes must be tested and stable before being released.li ol  p... what suggestions or alternative workflows can you recommend to promote a saner process where the majority of the burden is not on one personp

Negative 370 pI am developing a Java web application that will run on a secure intranet and does not require a user login. The application does, however, keep conversational state in an codeHttpSessioncode. User input is not persisted to the database until they explicitly click a save button at some stage in the conversation. Until then, their input is retained in the codeHttpSessioncode object. If their session expires, the user must be directed to a page that informs them of the session expiry.  p  pThis is working fine except for a problem with the redirect. When a user allows their session to sit idle for longer than the time defined in codeltsessiontimeoutgtcode, the session expires as expected. However, my attempt to redirect the user to a simple Your session has expired page seems to have backfired. The redirect works alright, but unless the user closes all the open browser windows on their desktop not just the ones that were open to my web app page they will continue being redirected to the session expired page forever.  p  pHere are my constraintsp  ul liClient workstations use Internet Explorer.

I think the pseudorandom data should be good enough for a salt with 10000 iterations of PBKDF2.p  pHowever, where do I take my initialization vector from Is it OK if I take some semirandom data time  random and SHA that, say, 10000 times Should I take arc4random with a seed taken from randomp  pDo I even need an IV if I effectively never use the same key twice the salt is recomputed every time the stored data is changed Whats the best way to deal with situations like thesep  pEdit Just a single user me, owning the IPod, encryption algorithm AESCBC 256 bit. The file just stores a siteaccountpassword list for various websites. It is rarely modified whenever I create a new account on a website, when that happens a new salt and a new IV is generated.p

Negative 370 pI am trying to create a Django webapp that utilizes the Twitter Streaming API via the tweepy.Stream function.  I am having a difficult time conceptualizing the proper implementation.p  pThe simplest functionality I would like to have is to count the number of tweets containing a hashtag in real time.  So I would open a stream, filtering by keywords, every time a new tweet comes over the connection i increment a counter.  That counter is then displayed on a webpage and updated with AJAX or otherwise.p  pThe problem is that the tweepy.Stream function must be continuously running and connected to twitter thats the point. How can I have this stream running in the background of a Django app while incrementing counters that can be displayed in near real timep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 370 pstrongI am looking for recommendations on displaying times in a web application in a time zone other than the users current time zone.strong  p  pWe store our datestimes in UTCGMT in the database, so it is not an issue to format the time for UTCGMT or the users current time zone.  However, in other situations we need to display the time from the point of view of an arbitrary time zone i.e. every datetime on this page is in Eastern, regardless of whether or not the user is in West Coast, Central, Eastern, etc..  p  pIn the past we have stored offsets or time zone info, then done the calculations in server code in .Net or else we have done some clientside manipulations in javascript that I would prefer to avoid, since it all becomes very dependent on javascript and the users browser.  Id like to know the best way to do this in a more clientsideMVC type application.p  pHere is an examplep  ol liDate stored in db 1302790667 Thu, 14 Apr 2011 141747 GMTli liConverted date displayed for a client in Central time zone Thu Apr 14 091747 2011li liDate I actually want to display, always in Eastern time zone Thu Apr 14 101747 2011li ol  pIn the above example, its easy to get the time in UTC 1 or the users current time zone 2 but it is more difficult to get 3.  My options seem to bep  ol liStore offsets or time zones in the db and do calculations on the client  this is what weve done in the past with .Net but it seems even messier in client side code is the path we are currently trying to avoid.li liDo the conversion on the server and send down a full date for display to the client  client receives a string Thu Apr 14 101747 2011.

Negative 370 pIm using SimpleURLConnections example to implement multipartformdata POST request using bound pair of streams. It works great in Simulator and on iPhone 3GSiPhone 4.p  pWhen I try it on iPhone 3G running 3.1.3 no data gets sent to the server. NSURLConnection just keeps hanging until it times out.

Negative 370 pIm working on creating a dashboard. I have started to refactor the application so methods relating to querying the database are generic or dynamic.p  pIm fairly new to the concept of generics and still an amateur programmer but I have done some searching and I have tried to come up with a solution. The problem is not really building the query string in a dynamic way. Im fine with concatenating string literals and variables, I dont really need anything more complex. The bigger issue for me is when I create this query, getting back the data and assigning it to the correct variables in a dynamic way.p  pLets say I have a table of defects, another for test cases and another for test runs.

Negative 370 pWell, there isnt much example code for this. Im writing a game loop and Im running into a snag. At first I attempted to create a schedule for the loop as this was listed under best practices as the way it should be done. My frame rate is 60 fps, and the loop was also running at an interval of 60 fps. I quickly noticed however that the interval time is little more than a suggestion, and the actual rate that the function is updating is highly erratic, ranging between 15 and 65 fps. This led to jumps in objects updating, even when their update distance was regulated as a function of time. Once updating dropped below 20 fps it became highly apparent when it updated and was quite ugly.p  pI then tried to create my own thread so that I could more closely regulate the update rate. With this method I was able to almost precisely regulate my updating rate. With this all movement and animations were smooth. The issue with this method is that cocos2d clearly doesnt support multithreading well as I periodically see screen tearing. Also, if my update rate doesnt precisely match my draw rate I see jumps. I believe this is due to the draw method firing in in the middle of my update loop, a common problem with multithreading.p  pThe two ways I can think of to solve this problem are to find some way to closely regulate the firing rate of the scheduler, or to find a way to lock the drawing code until I can finish my update. Ive been looking for quite some time for any examples on how to do either of these, and have met with no success. If anyone out there has a clearer idea of how to handle this kind of a situation I would be very appreciative of some advice. Im just too used to C and having things happen at the rate I tell them to. If you need me to post any additional information, just ask Thanks in advance for any assistance.p

Negative 370 pGood morning everyone,p  pI have a question about J2EE framework. p  psince ASP.net 3.5 mvc add a new feature strongRoutesstrong do we have similar function in j2ee p  phere is some text about this feature in asp.net3.5p  pRoutes are a new feature in .NET 3.5 SP1, and ASP.NET MVC uses this feature to give controller classes the capability to respond to requests. ASP.NET MVC uses RESTlike URLs Representational State Transfer that are cleaner than regular ASP.NET web application URLs. Here are examples of such URLsp  precodeproductsshow881 customerslist loginregister codepre  pAs you can see, RESTlike URLs tend to be clean, simple, and dont expose .aspx files directly on the server. Although you can have directly addressed .aspx pages in ASP.NET MVC applications, this is not the main idea.p  pThrough developerdefined routes, the ASP.NET MVC application can direct requests to controllers. Routes are defined once for the entire ASP.NET application, so the Global.asax file is the logical place to define these. In fact, if you take a look at the default Global.asax.cs file in an ASP.NET MVC application, you will see a method called RegisterRoutes defined. This method is called from the ApplicationStart method, and implemented like thisp  precodepublic static void RegisterRoutesRouteCollection routes     routes.IgnoreRouteresource.axdpathInfo    routes.MapRoute       Default,       controlleractionid,       new  controller  Home,          action  Index,          id         codepre  pBy default, a route called Default is defined with three parts controller, action, and finally an ID separated by slashes. When a request arrives at the MVC application, the URL is parsed according to this definition. For instance, given the request for productsshow881, this would be parsed so that the controller parameter would have the value of products, the action parameter would be show, and finally the id would be 881.p

The list is in the form ofp  precode Djfsid  LJflsdflsdf  fjlsdlf  fsdf  .  .  . codepre  pThere are no real consistancies so optomizing the list by removing duplicates or checking for is one entry a substring of another entry wont do much.p  pI basically want to OS walk down a directory, open a file, check for the signature, close and move on.p  pTo speed things up I will break the list up into 50n different sublists where N is the number of cores and have a thread do work on a few entries of the list.p  pWould using a giant regex codere.searchentry1entry2entry3....entryK, FILECONTENTScode or a giant codefor i in xrange0,NUMSUBENTRIES...if subentry[i] in FILECONTENTS...code be better offp  pAlso is this a good way to multithread  This is unix so multiple threads can work on the same file at the same time.  Will disk access basically bottelneck me to the point where multithreading is uselessp

It seems that Google Chrome has updated from strong12.xxstrong to strong13.0.782.107mstrong and now, all of a sudden, CSS3 properties with codewebkitcode prefixes has stopped working, and elements which have this property applied to them just doesnt show anymore.

Negative 370 pI recently discovered the linker option Bsymbolicfunctions in GNU ldp  precodeBsymbolic   When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the    definition within the shared library, if any. Normally, it is possible    for a program linked against a shared library to override the definition    within the shared library.     This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared libraries.  Bsymbolicfunctions   When creating a shared library, bind references to global function symbols    to the definition within the shared library, if any.      This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared libraries. codepre  pThis seems to be the inverse of the GCC option codefvisibilityhiddencode, in that instead of preventing the export of the referenced function to other shared objects, it prevents libraryinternal references to that function from being bound to an an exported function of a different shared object. I informed myself that codeBsymbolicfunctionscode will prevent the creation of PLT entries for the functions, which is a nice side effect.p  ol lipBut I was wondering whether there is perhaps a finergrained control over this, like overwriting codeBsymboliccode for individual function definitions of a library. pli lipShould I be aware of any pitfalls of using codeBsymbolicfunctionscode I plan to only use that, because the codeBsymboliccode will break exceptions, I think it will make it so that references to typeinfo objects are not unified, I think. pli ol  pThanksp

Negative 370 pIm thinking about good approaches to develop web software. Spring is great for JDBC stuff but it also has a nice feature for autocompleting faulty forms, nice backing beans for prefilling forms and so on.p  pNow I started with JSF and it seems more correct than Spring for doing MVC. I like the xhtml approaches, including templates, defining these webflows in the facesconfig.xml and so on. p  pBut there is no clear separation  of concerns because both frameworks can work with forms, and I am pretty sure you will have to make your mind up if Faces or Spring shall make the forms. Im tending towards JSF but Im missing these nifty error handling and prefilling features.p  pCan JSF do these things also Im new to JSF so Im not sure how mighty it is.p

Negative 370 pI know that rich text boxes in HTML is a bit of a minefield, but Im hoping this particular situation wont be too tricky. I want a text box which the user cant format, but through scripting I can have it add some light formatting to so a textarea wont work.p  pMy first thought was that I could use a codecontentEditablecode, and if the user doesnt have a toolbar, they cant do much, but theres still the Ctrl  B, Ctrl  I, etc combinations. So I did thisp  precodectrlHandler  function event      event.preventDefault   this.keydownfunction event      if event.ctrlKey          this.bindkeypress, ctrlHandler       this.keyupfunction event      if event.ctrlKey          this.unbindkeypress, ctrlHandler       codepre  pSo when the Ctrl key is pressed codekeydowncode an event handler is bound to keypress which prevents the default and when its released the event handler is unbound. Clever, eh Id work out how to handle cutcopypaste etc combinations later. With this, the event handler gets bound correctly, but codeevent.preventDefaultcode doesnt actually prevent the default The text gets made bolditalicunderlined exactly as if Id done nothing. The formatting change seems to happen before the event fires. Using codekeydowncode or codekeyupcode instead of codekeypresscode doesnt work either. Can anyone think of another cross browser approach, or how to make this one workp

Negative 370 pLooking for some advice on how to proceed here.p  pI am trying to do some integration testing on wcf services that call other wcf services. I want to make sure that they are configured correctly between one another. We are currently using spring.net and Nhibernate. What I am not sure about is how to check that the database is getting updated without actually saving anything to the database.p  pI have both msmq and wshttp services that I am trying to test here. I am familiar with transactions, as we use them in spring, but I have no idea how to setup my tests to rollback the transaction in a service that is not being tested directly by the integration test. p  pRight now the only option I have come up with is using a test database and test data, but it seems like there has to be a better solution than this. p
Negative 370 pWhat Im trying to achieve is to use htaccess to only allow requests coming in from the same server, but do so by using available variables and not specify the IP. The goal is to be able to run cron jobs and ajax requests to the files in the respective folder, but return a 404 page if tried to access directly.p  pHeres what I have so farp  precodeOptions MultiViews FollowSymLinks   RewriteEngine On     RewriteCond REMOTEADDR SERVERADDR[NC]   RewriteRule . error404.html [L,R404]   codepre  pThis works fine for ajax. It works for cronjobs too if the server happens to use the same outgoing IP, but if the servers outgoing IP is different from the IP of the site, obviously it will fail and return 404 because codeREMOTEADDRcode is different from codeSERVERADDRcode. One solution would be to see what the outgoing IP is for that server and add it as another exception. However Im looking for a more reusable solution. I tried using regex to match only the first part of the IPs but Im having no luck with that. Dont really know how to go about this. Basically with regex what Im trying to achieve is this lets assumep  precodeREMOTEADDR  192.322.122.50   SERVERADDR  192.322.122.1   codepre  pThese are the 2 variables I need to find a valid comparison expression for. This expression would return true if the first part of the IPs is identical.p  pAnother way would be to specify the range that is allowed, but I dont know what the wanted range is. I know its the first part if the codeSERVERADDRcode variable, but I dont know how to tell the server what I mean Dp  pHopefully I wasnt too confusing. Ultimately what Im looking for is a way to determine whether a request is coming from the same server as the site this is on. And it has to be achieved through the .htaccess file. Why Because the protected folder also contains files other than php scripts, so the alternative would be to serve all of those dynamically and use PHP for all the conditions. Using a plain htaccess command would be much more elegant. I just hope there is a way to do this.p

Negative 370 pi have a small problem where my mandelbrot set is represented as a heightmap matrix, when every cell contains the number of iterations it took a single point to reach infinity or less.br in the end a 3d model is printed. my problem appears when i zoom rapidly and i begin to see that the entire set floatsbecause the number of iterations gets higher for each pixel.br is there a way to force the model to stay on 0 y axis but still let it grow as each point gets different number of iterations  p  pive tried to find the point which requires the smallest amount of iterationsand basically the lowest point in the set and subtracts it from all points but that didnt work.since num of iterations changes every zoom process it made the set jump from value 5 to 100 for example.  p

Negative 370 pIn the product I am building for Mac OSX,I need to support 10.5,10.6 and 10.7.  I am using NSTextView as an editor. I use it to display both text and images.

Negative 370 pIm just getting started with the Delphi Spring Framework and was wondering whether the current version of the DI container somehow allows delegating the construction to a factory method without specifying an implementing typep  pE.g. something similar to thisp  precodeGlobalContainer   .RegisterFactoryltISomeObjectgt     function ISomeObject      begin        Result  CreateComObjectCLASSSomeObject as ISomeObject      end   .ImplementsltISomeObjectgt   could probably be implied from the above   .AsSingletonPerThread codepre  pAs you can see, my specific use case is the instantiation of COM objects. In that case the class implementing the interface Im interested in is not part of my application but I am still able to create instances by calling codeCreateComObjectcode  codeCoCreateInstancecode. However, it seems Im out of luck as registrations in the Container always appear to be bound to an actual implementing class.p  pAssuming this isnt possible as such at the moment, how would you experts out there address this Would you create a wrapper class or dummy class or would you simply keep COM objects out of the DI container and simply instantiate them via codeCreateComObjectcodep

Negative 370 pWhat is the difference between a public abstract class with a public constructor, and a public class with a protected constructor.  We dont have any functions that are abstract in our abstract class, but we want programmers to only be capable of creating objects that extend that class.p  pBoth scenarios compile and work, however I dont understand which would be better to use in what scenario.  I have been brought up to understand that although you cannot instantiate an abstract class directly only through a non abstract child class, the abstract class should normally contain abstract functions that are required to be implemented by the children of that class.p  pWouldnt having a protected constructor in a public class signify that instantiation of this class is not possible this is the only constructor we have.p

Negative 370 pIn a child activity, I record some audio using MediaRecorder and have two buttons The first one will start recording and second one is going back to its parent activity. However every time I hit go back button, it takes a long time to return to main activitys view. My code inside go back buttons callback isp  precodepublic void onClickView arg0                  if arg0.getId  R.id.startRecord                      StartRecording                    else if arg0.getId  R.id.goBack                 ifmediaRecordernull                          mediaRecorder.stop              mediaRecorder.release              mediaRecorder  null                    this.finish              codepre  pThe parent activitys codeonCreatecode method only initiate several buttons and set listener methods to them. I really cannot figure out why go back action will take a long time. A phenomenon worthy to mention is that if I dont record first but hit go back button first, it goes back really quick to the parent activity. The long responding time only happens after I record some audio. I do upload the recorded audio however I put the uploading in a codeAsyncTaskcode task and I can get feedback when uploading work is done. After I see the feedback, and even wait for some time, the go back button still takes a long time to bring me back to main activity. Anyone has advices on this Thanksp

Negative 370 pThis is the weirdest thing Ive ever faced.

CollectionView filters and orders properly, and the View works as expected. Except when I bind it to a ListView.ItemsSource property strongit just behaves as if it didnt implemented codeINotifyCollectionChangedcodestrong. Nobody listens to the CollectionChanged event checked with the debugger and strongthe UI doesnt update with new elements addedstrong. But if I add some items and then set the ItemsSource property, the UI updates. Just as if it were a normal, nonobservable list. p  pDoes anybody know what can be happening here Ive tried deleting the codeIObservableCollectioncode interface, so codeFilteredSortedCollectioncode just implemented codeIReadOnlyListltTgtcode and codeINotifyCollectionChangedcode directly, but it didnt worked.p

Im having a very hard time understanding the coding of disjoint sets, I figured I try a way Im more familiar with.p  pAny help with where to store the values and compare and organize them would be great. Links to places where I read info on this would help. Ive read a lot over the past few days.

Negative 370 pIm deploying my Rails 3 app to a subdirectory codesapacode of my hosting service. To hit the codesapacode subdirectory, I added a scope to coderoutes.rbcode, but this left the application looking in codeassetscode which is not part of my app for .js and .css instead of codesapaassetscode Id have been quite happy with codeassetscode, but for some reason, it doesnt do that. Therefore Im using both a codescopecode statement in my coderoutes.rbcode and a codeconfig.assets.prefixcode in my codeapplication.rbcode.p  pUnfortunately, this causes my coderake assetsprecompilecode to build into codepublicsapaassetscode instead of just into codepublicassetscode. I can copy the files to the right location and everything works, but Id love for someone to tell me a better way one must exist, right.

Negative 370 pIm thinking of doing an image processing app for android as my senior year project.

SqlDatareader has no public constructor. As far as I can tell I cannot write any tests using that class as I cannot instantiate it without making a legitimate call to a database using SqlCommand. Even trying to create an interface of a SqlDataReaderWrapper will no help me as the problem is the same. I am not trying to write an integration test making actual calls to a DB and so the DataReader seems impossible to test as is. My question is, is there anything i can do, to put values into a SqlDataReader in this situationp

Negative 370 pI have got a bit of an issue and was wondering if there is a way to have my cake and eat it.p  pCurrently I have a Repository and Query style pattern for how I am using Linq2Sql, however I have got one issue and I cannot see a nice way to solve it. Here is an example of the problemp  precodevar someDataMapper  new SomeDataMapper var someDataQuery  new GetSomeDataQuery var results  SomeRepository.HybridQuerysomeDataQuery                             .Wherex gt x.SomeColumn  1  x.SomeColumn  2                             .OrderByDescendingx gt x.SomeOtherColumn                             .Selectx gt someDataMapper.Mapx  return results.Wherex gt x.SomeMappedColumn  SomeType codepre  pThe main bits to pay attention to here are Mapper, Query, Repository and then the final where clause. I am doing this as part of a larger refactor, and we found that there were ALOT of similar queries which were getting slightly different result sets back but then mapping them the same way to a domain specific model. So take for example getting back a codetblcarcode and then mapping it to a codeCarcode object. So a mapper basically takes one type and spits out another, so exactly the same as what would normally happen in the selectp  precode Non mapped version selectx gt new Car       Id  x.Id,     Name  x.Name,     Owner  x.FirstName  x.Surname    Mapped version selectx gt carMapper.Mapx codepre  pSo the car mapper is more reusable on all areas which do similar queries returning same end results but doing different bits along the way. However I keep getting the error saying that Map is not able to be converted to SQL, which is fine as I dont want it to be, however I understand that as it is in an expression tree it would try to convert it.p  precodeMethod SomeData MapSomeTable has no supported translation to SQL. codepre  pFinally the object that is returned and mapped is passed further up the stack for other objects to use, which make use of Linq to SQLs composition abilities to add additional criteria to the query then finally ToList or itterate on the data returned, however they filter based on the mapped model, not the original table model, which I believe is perfectly fine as answered in a previous questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13623344linq2sqlpointofretrievingdataLinq2Sql point of retrieving dataap  pSo to sum it up, can I use my mapping pattern as shown without it trying to convert that single part to SQLp

Negative 370 pI have almost finished my iPhone app, which revolves around social networking. I have come across an issue... Each value which is printed, friends, friend requests etc are printed onto a website, from a SQL Database, and then the iPhone reads this and renders it into a UILabel via echo.

I have tried putting some validation on the webpage for example bobvalidatejoshvalidatejohnvalidate but I dont know how to get the iPhone to detect the validate and print the values inbetween in onto an individual label. I hope im making sense Thanks in advancep

Negative 370 h3Edith3  pI forgot to add initially, but the really big requirement is that this need to be deliverable as an .exe. Im using PyInstaller now to crunch everything down to an executable, but I have no idea how everything fits together when you start involving multiple programming languages. p  hr  pI have a small gui which I wrote using Python and wxWidgets. The real core of the program, being that it is CPU and Network intensive, I spawn in a new process using the multiprocessing module. That way the gui stays responsive, and the second process it free to run in its own memoryprocessor space. Finally, I use a thread with a codeMultiprocess.Queuecode to handle communication between the gui, itself, and the process. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhE36G.png altenter image description herep  pNow, the problem is that Python is just a touch to slow to handle the main functionality. So I quickly prototyped the build in Java, and Im getting around a 60 increase in speed. So, for the core logic, I want to port everything to Java. p  pHowever, Ive put in a emtonem of work into the Gui with Python and WX, so I dont want to rewrite that aspect in Java. So, my question is, how would I go about combining these two separate systems p  pThe extent of the communication is, for the most part, issuing start and stop commands. The rest is tiny updates that get fed back to the gui just to let the user know what its currently working on. p  pHopefully that all makes sense p

The user can edit an existing company through that view.p  pMy question is  How do I incorporate the modified data Should I modify the existing, retrieved Company entity object, or should I create a new instance that contains the new datap  pThe former would save creation of a new instance, and a possible copying of unmodified data. However, it means exposing setters for each field of the Company. This goes against reducing mutability.p  pThe latter option would create one new instance, and might involve copying unmodified data. However, it will save me from exposing setters, thus encouraging immutability.p  pWhich one is recommendedp  pAlso, does Deferred Binding  Reflection or Serialization require all gettersetters to be present In that case, my question becomes moot, as I will have to provide them anyways.p  pEDIT  I am using GWTRPC for communication with server.p

Im passing it the value to return JSON.p  pHowever, emon strongsomestrong client machines, the response comes back as HTMLem, regardless, and therefore I get a deserialization error invalid JSON string.

Negative 370 pIm curious about the benefits and tradeoffs of using numpy a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocnumpyreferenceufuncs.html relnofollowufuncsa vs. the builtin operators vs. the function versions of the builtin operators.p  pIm curious about all ufuncs.  Maybe there are times when some are more useful than others.  However, Ill use codeltcode for my examples just for simplicity.p  pThere are several ways to filter a numpy array by a single number to get a boolean array.  Each form gives the same results, but is there a preferred timeplace to use one over the other  This example Im comparing an array against a single number, so all 3 will work.p  pConsider all examples using the following arrayp  precodegtgtgt x  numpy.arange0, 10000 gtgtgt x array[   0,    1,    2, ..., 9997, 9998, 9999] codepre  h2lt operatorh2  precodegtgtgt x lt 5000 array[ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtypebool gtgtgt timeit x lt 5000 100000 loops, best of 3 15.3 us per loop codepre  h2operator.lth2  precodegtgtgt import operator gtgtgt operator.ltx, 5000 array[ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtypebool gtgtgt timeit operator.ltx, 5000 100000 loops, best of 3 15.3 us per loop codepre  h2numpy.lessh2  precodegtgtgt numpy.lessx, 5000 array[ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtypebool gtgtgt timeit numpy.lessx, 5000 100000 loops, best of 3 15 us per loop codepre  pNote that all of them achieve pretty much the equivalent performance and exactly the same results.  Im guessing that all of these calls actually end up in the same function anyway since codeltcode and codeoperator.ltcode both map to codeltcode on a numpy array, which is probably implemented using codenumpy.lesscode or the equivalentp  pSo, which is more idiomatic and preferredp

Negative 370 pNew to r and was hoping to find an elegant way of solving what seems like a simple problem.  The context of the problem is as follows I am running regressions for a set of companies at rolling periods of time.  I am storing the summary of each regression in a list of lists.  So, for examplep  pcoderesults[[i]][[t]]  summarylmyxcode, where codeycode and codexcode are the associated vectors for company codeicode at time codetcode. I would like to extract matrices like codesigmacode from coderesultscode such thatp  precodesigma[i,t]  results [[i]] [[t]]sigma codepre  pClearly I can do this with nested loops, but it seems that there must be a simple way of extracting this matrix in one step with something like lapply, sapply, etc. I have seen similar problems answered throughout the web and this blog, but have not been able to correctly adapt them to this problem.  Another twist is some of the entries in results are Null, which happens when there is insufficient data for a specific company at a specific time to run the regression.p  pAny help or direction would be much appreciated.p

Negative 370 pIm using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworking relnofollowAFNetworkinga library, which is excellent, however Im having trouble keeping track of operations in the NSOperationQueue.  I am adding NSOperation objects to the NSOperationQueue, and I need to keep track of progress  so update a UIProgressView to show how far the queue is to completion and then also execute a block of code once the queue is complete.p  pIve tried KVO  using the answer here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1049001getnotificationwhennsoperationqueuefinishesalltasksGet notification when NSOperationQueue finishes all tasksa however I come across the problem elaborated on the second answer down there where sometimes operations in the queue may complete fast enough to temporarily decrement the operationCount property to 0  which then cause issues with the code in the accepted answer  i.e. prematurely execute the code to be executed after all objects in the queue have finished and progress tracking will not be accurate as a result.p  pA variation Ive tried is checking for operationCount  0 in the success block of each NSOperation that I add to the NSOperationQueue and then executing code based on that, e.g.p  precode    [AFImageRequestOperation imgRequest  [AFImageRequestOperation imageRequestOperationWithRequesturlRequest successUIImage image        Process image amp save              ifoperationQ.operationCount  0                execute completion of Queue code here                          else                 track progress of the queue here and update UIProgressView                  ] codepre  pHowever, I come up with the same issue as I do with KVO.p  pIve thought about using GCD with a dispatch queue using a completion block  so asynchronously dispatch an NSOperationQueue and then execute the completion block but that doesnt solve my issue with regard to keeping track of the queue progress to update UIProgressView.p  pAlso not used p  pcodeAFHttpClient enqueueBatchOfHTTPRequestOperationsNSArray  progressBlockNSUInteger numberOfFinishedOperations, NSUInteger totalNumberOfOperationsprogressBlock completionBlockNSArray operationscompletionBlockcode p  psince my images are coming from a few different URLs rather than one base url.p  pAny suggestions or pointers will be appreciated.  Thanks.p  pstrongJust a final updatestrongp  pSolved this issue using the AFHTTPClient enqueueBatchOfHTTPRequestOperations in the end with the help of Matt see accepted answer and note the comments as well.p  pI did come across another solution that does not make use of AFHTTPClient but just NSOperationQueue on its own.  Ive included this as well in case its of any use to anyone, but if youre using the AFNetworking Library Id recommend the accepted answer since its most elegant and easy to implement.p

Negative 370 pAfter researching here and other sites, I cannot seem to find an answer that helps me solve my problem or helps me move forward. I may not be using the correct terminology in my search. The info I find seems to focus on autosizing for portrait versus landscape views of the iPhone or iPad, but not so much on vertical respacing between the 3.5 and 4 form factors.p  pI have laid out an example single view in Xcode 4.6.2 to fit nicely on the iPhone Retina 3.5 form factor screen, but when I click to apply the Retina 4 form factor there is an empty space near the bottom. I would have expected all the view items to space out vertically to give a similar pleasant layout. I have tried different constraint setting, even setting the vertical spacings to  on the view items.p  pYour help is very much appreciatedp  pI tried to post screen shot of each of the form factors but my reputation is to low.p
Negative 370 pI am developing a responsive web app which will output links to different businesses a hrefhttpsplus.google.comappbasiclocal relnofollowhttpsplus.google.comappbasiclocala  pages.

This worked, however, when the strongteetimesfrommysqlstrong was SELECTed from my MYSQL database, it only took the most recently booked tee time only one and excluded that....the rest got ignored or simply were never fetched, not sure....so it doesnt work if there is more than one booked tee time which there is obviously going to be more than that....my question is how do I exclude a time if they equal any of times in the database.p  precodefor istartHour i lt endHour i      for j  0 j lt 55 j5              timepre  i..strpadj, 2, 0, STRPADLEFT         time  .timepre . .day.                    timeformatedforcosmetic  dategi a, strtotimetime         timeformatedformysql  dateYmd His, strtotimetime           if time  teetimesfrommysql             time                     else             time  ltoption value . timeformatedformysql . gt.timeformatedforcosmetic .ltoptiongt                  echo time       codepre  h1THIS IS MY MYSQL FETCH ALSOh1  precodeteetimesfrommysql    sql  SELECT  FROM teetimes query  mysqliquerydbconx, sql whilerow  mysqlifetchassocquery     teetimesfrommysql  row[datetime]     teetimesfrommysql   dateGi njy, strtotimeteetimesfrommysql       codepre

They will then search again for more items and perform the same  all the time building their collection. p  pOnce they are happy with the collection they have created they move to the publish page where I need to output the contents of the collection into a template of the users choice. p  pThe main problems I am facing is being able to add the post IDs and modified meta to local storage  DOM  COOKIE etc, some advice on the best solution would be great. p  pI have searched high and low and I cannot find anything that does this without getting bogged down in useless ecommerce features. p  pMany thanks p

Negative 370 pIm trying to annotate a Flot.js chart based on a hrefhttpwww.flotcharts.orgflotexamplesannotatingindex.html relnofollowthisa example, this is done by adding an absolutelypositioned div which floats over the canvas, which is fine when you have a single chart with a fixed width and static content.

Negative 370 pSo, here is the situation. I have a base class SSSAdEnabledTableViewController with a XIB file that has a contentView inside the main view and and tableView inside that view. The base class is being used to renderhide ads. p  pI then have numerous subclasses that inherit from that base class. Most work fine with regard to the table view except for those that need a nonstandard table cell in this case, SSSDataEntryTableCell. p  pIf I try to register the nib for that custom table cell in my subclasss viewDidLoad after calling super, it does not work and my table view data source and delegate are returning nil cells. However, if I register the NIB before calling super, it seems to work just fine. p  pThe question I have is if this is bad practice and is indicative that I am doing something wrong that in turn is causing the need to do this.p  pThe relevant code snippets are belowp  pBase Class  SSSAdEnabledTableViewControllerp  precodeinterface SSSAdEnabledEditTableViewController  UIViewController ltADBannerViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegategt       the data table     UITableView tableView       our inner view to showhide ads     UIView contentView       our ad banner     ADBannerView bannerView    property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet UIView contentView property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet UITableView tableView property nonatomic, retain ADBannerView bannerView   end codepre  pAnd its viewDidLoad methodp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]            set the appropriate background color          UIColor clr  nil       if  [[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom]  UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad               clr  kSSSDefaultBackgroundColor           else              clr  [UIColor groupTableViewBackgroundColor]            [[self view] setBackgroundColorclr]       [tableView setAutoresizesSubviewsYES]       codepre  pHere is one of the subclassess viewDidLoad methodp  precode voidviewDidLoad       Load the NIB file for our custom cell  do this before [super viewDidLoad]     UINib nib  [UINib nibWithNibNamekSSSDataEntryTableCell bundlenil]        Register the NIB which contains the cell     [tableView registerNibnib forCellReuseIdentifierkSSSDataEntryTableCell]       [super viewDidLoad]       ... does some other stuff not relevant to the question at hand ...  codepre  pSo, if I call [super viewDidLoad] first, it appears the code is calling the UITableView methods for cellForRowAtIndexPath BEFORE the NIB is registered and is failing. With it before the call, it appears to work just fine.p  pIs this the correct way to do this or I am I doing it wrongp  pThanksp

Negative 370 pMy IP address is 172.20.35.3, Im trying codenmap sn 172.20.35.100code and monitoring the traffic using wireshark. The ping is successful, however wireshark only shows a DNS query request sent from 172.20.35.3 to the DNS server and the DNS replies with no such name Monitoring the traffic on my target IP address shows no incoming frames.

Negative 370 pIm using the Android AChartEngine 1.1.0 DialChart for an internal company app used for realtime data visualization. Im updating a DialChart frequently at about 10Hz by applying set on the CategorySeries attached to the Dial and then calling repaint.p  pFor the most part, things seem to be working great. However, Ive noticed that when and only when I set the visual type to DialRenderer.Type.NEEDLE and also set the DialRenderer.setScale to something other than 1, the needle sometimes flickers and disappears momentarily in an intermittent fashion while being updated.p  pIf I set the visual type to ARROW or dont call setScale, I dont observe this behavior.p  pIs this a known bug in AChartEngine Are there better practices I could use to avoid this problemp  pThanksp

It doesnt take long, but Id like to just write a quick program that copies a template query definition, changes the name of the developer, and saves a copy of it. It would be especially useful when we decide to add a column to the query. Currently I have to manually modify 20 queries definitions.

Negative 370 pIm trying to statically link the cilk library to my program, in order to be able to run the executable on environments that dont have the cilk libraries installed since it is not so common.p  pHere is the best I could come up withp  precodecilkc Ofast Wextra pedantic fwholeprogram flto msse4.2 m64 lm mtunegeneric funrollloops finlinefunctions ffastmath lpthread lz DUSEGCC Wc,stdc99 Wc,pipe DUSEFILE32API usrlocalliblibcilk.a usrlocallibcilklibcilkrt0.a srcall.c srcCilkSearch.cilk codepre  pAs stated, i manually link libcilk.a and libcilkrt0.a to prevent gcc to link to the shared libraries.  This makes the program size increase from 266Kb to 344Kb, which makes me think the static linking succeeded.p  pSadly, though, when i inspect with otool the dependencies of my executable, i getp  precodebinhayabusa usrliblibz.1.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.5 usrlocalliblibcilk.0.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0 usrliblibSystem.B.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0 optlocallibgcc47libgccs.1.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0 codepre  pI understand zlib and gcc, which i didnt statically link yet. But why is the libcilk.0.dylib dependency still there if i manually linked to libcilk.ap  pI also actually try to run the program on another computer, but at startup the program terminates complaining that usrlocalliblibcilk.0.dylib cannot be loaded.p  pSo my question is, explicitly specifying the .a to gcc is not enough to drop the specified library dependency  What else should I do to have my libcilk linked statically and not loaded at runtimep  pI already know about the static option, but i dont want every library including system ones to be statically linked, I only want the cilk library to be statically linked.br Is this possible at allp

Negative 370 pI am using CR 2008. That version allows the use dynamic parameters instead of static parameter. Using that type of parameter will direct CR to go inside the tableview and display what is resided inside the database for us to select the datainformation for filtering. That is nice and convenient feature but each time I run the report, I was prompted with server name, user name and password. The user name is the name of the schema and its related password. Those credentials are not supposed to be disclosed to users. p  pHave anyone come across the same issue and how do you stop CR report from asking for these credentials It did not ask when I switch to static parameters... the prompt only shows up when dynamic parameters are used.p  pThanksp

Negative 370 pI am to develop a Joomla 3.1 Template. The template should consist of a static header and footer, as well as multiple pages, all of which need their own styling. Further, the client would like to be able to add events to a specific listings page.

However, I am now running into some problemsp  pHow would I approach the content section Ideally, a page would consist of multiple, editable sections. The client would be able to edit said sections in the backend without having to deal with or accidentally changing the layout or styling of the page itself.

Even google only got me so far basic structure, index.php, templateDetails.xml and so forth. Are there any other resources I may have missed or do I really need to refer to other templates most of which, obviously, arent free and use vardump all the timep  pWriting this, I just realized that I could theoretically build a template for every single page but ... that surely cant be right, rightp  pIf someone could provide a basic outline or at least tell me how you personally would tackle a project like this, itd be very much appreciated.p  pAll the best p  pEditp  pI just found some video tutorials but since my bandwidth is limited, I cannot watch them.

Negative 370 pI recently upgraded from 2005 to 2012 about 10 months.  When I first started using SSMS2012 it worked great was able to open multiple windows in a particular database.  For about that last 23 months SSMS hangs when I try to open more than 1 query window or open a file.  It is random but happens a majority of the time.  I have been able to interrupt the hang a few times.  When I interrupt it I get the login screen and it sits there trying to log in apparently unsuccessfully.  If I cancel the login and try it again with the same entries it connects just fine and things are great, but I have to do this for every window and I cannot often break into that screen before it stops responding. p  pI have searched extensively and have not found an answer to this problem.  It only appears to be happening to a particular instance.  The instance does not show any signs of issues, has been rebooted and configuration checked for inconsistencies, etc.  I am at a loss.  If anyone has experienced this and has been able to resolve it I would appreciate a response.p  pAgain this is a fresh install of 2012 standard with 2005 imported databases.  All indications show that it is working fine.  compatibility level for a majority of the databases are still 90, until I can clear them for 11 with the software they house.  I have a test environment with the restored versions on a different server and no issues result from that instance  I can open up multiples without incident.  My belief is it is something with that particular instance, but I am not sure where else to look. p  pThank you in advance.p

Ideally this would be PHP only, but Id also like answers involving AJAX if you can be specific about how I should implement the code.p

Negative 370 pConsider the following use case, that Im trying to implement. Im using Flask, FlaskSQLAlchemy to store user data in a SQLite db, and FlaskAdmin, for its File Admin feature.p  pThe flow is like this when a user logs in, hes taken to the admin modules index view. But when he logs in, his username is added to the path used when the FileAdmin class is initialized  the idea is to have user directories, which are created by a simple shell command when the user registers. So if the root path defined in Flask is files, and my username is rudimk, then the path that should be used when initializing the file admin should be filesrudimk. p  pThe thing is, when the app starts up, there is no session, no user logged in  but the file admin is initialized, with the default path, which, in our case, is files. When a user does log in, there is no way to reinitialize the file admin class, since it is outside the request context. I looked at getbasepath from the flaskadmin docs, but I havent been able to figure out how itd be useful here.p  pMuch appreciated. Thanksp  pEDIT  Added some code I was working in.

Negative 370 pThis is a followup question to a question I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20223962pythonoperationsonallelementsofanarraywithoutaloopherea, but its a very different question, so I thought I would post it separately.p  pI have a Python script which reads an very large array, and I needed to optimize an operation on each element see referenced SO question. I now need to split the output array into two separate arrays.p  pI have the codep  precodeoutput  [True if lenelementinarray  2 else False for elementinarray in masterlist] codepre  pwhich outputs an array of length codelenmasterlistcode consisting of True or False, depending on if the length of codeelementinarraycode is odd or even. My problem is that I need to split codemasterlistcode into two arrays one array containing the codeelementinarraycodes that correspond to the codeTruecode elements in codeoutputcode and another containing the codeelementinarraycodes corresponding to the codeFalsecode elements in codeoutputcode.p  pThis can clearly be done with traditional array operators such as codeappendcode, but I need this to be as optimized and as fast as possible. I have many millions of elements in my codemasterlistcode, so is there a way to accomplish this without directly looping through codemasterlistcode and using codeappendcode to create two new arrays.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 370 pI am writing a small program in java which is prompting some messages at the console and expects some user input from it.

How do i manage to make my program open a cmdwindow on startupp
Negative 370 pI am writing a framework that calls into code written by other people the framework plays Monopoly and calls into player AIs. The AIs tell the framework what to do in the return values of function calls. p  pI would like to check the types of the return values to make sure that they wont blow up my framework code.p  pFor examplep  precodeinstructions  player.sellhouses  Process the instructions... codepre  pIn this example I am expecting the player to return a list of tuples, such asp  precode[Square.BOWSTREET, 2, Square.MARLBOROUGHSTREET, 2, Square.VINESTREET, 1] codepre  pIs there a simplish way to validate what the AI returns to me Im imagining something like thisp  precode    instructions  player.sellhouses     if not typecheckinstructions, [str, int]          Data was not valid... codepre  pI dont just want to check that the returned data is a list. I want to check that it is a list of a specific type. In the example, it is a list of tuples where each tuple holds a string and an integer.p  pIve seen that a lot of the Python typechecking questions get the answer type checking is evil. If so, what should I be doing in this case There doesnt seem to be anything stopping the AI code from returning absolutely anything, and I have to be able to validate or cope with it in some way.p  hr  pEdit I could check this by hand by writing a function. For codeinstructionscode above it could be something like thisp  precodedef isvalidinstructions     if not isinstanceinstructions, list return False     for item in instructions         if not isinstanceitem, tuple return False         if lenitem  2 return False         if not isinstanceitem[0], str return False         if not isinstanceitem[1], int return False     return True codepre  pBut in this case, I would have to write a similarly complex validation function for each type of value I need to validate. So Im wondering if a more generic validation function or library exists where I can give it an expression like code[str, int]code and it will validate against it without having to do the work by hand.p

Negative 370 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqHP4X.gif altenter image description herep  pemFigure 1  Working Demoemp  pIm running a winforms application and I have implemented a status  progress TreeView. It can display the status by icon and progress of a possibly hierarchical set of tasks to accomplish. My question is not about how to implement the TreeView control itself. Ive got that part covered. The TreeView is merely the way the background work is going to status  progress itself to the user.p  pI have a set of methods that I want to run on not the main UI thread. They need to run in order. They are steps in a larger process. I could organize them into a hierarchy that would make a nice tree structure.p  pEach of these methods will be represented by a node in the tree. I probably got the idea for this method of visualization from the old Sql Server DTS status panel. I still like that idea.p  pI want to know when each method finishes and its outcome, and possibly a few textual statuses along the way. I also want a general mechanism that I can use to bubble up progress. I will use those to do an owner drawn progress bar in the TreeView on the node that corresponds to that method.p  pIve read up some on multithreading, and also on the Task class, but dont really understand it fully. And I dont care if the solution uses that or not. But maybe that would be more elegant I dont know.

Negative 370 pI have seen quite a lot of instances where the term Web Services amp Service Oriented Architecture  SOA, have been used interchangeably.   But, I am sure a lot of you would agree that they are just not the same, where SOA is way beyond and a lot more than just Web Services   p  pNevertheless, going to my questions, being a small company that we are as of now, we have this new business to provide a bunch of web services  to external clients other companies. So, I have the following questions in mind, in this regard  p  p1 Should we just concentrate on developing these bunch of web services Java, Spring and deploying them independently and deliver to the clients to begin with, or should we also consider bringing them all together and providing means for web service governance by using SOA infrastructures like Mule ESB, Apache ServiceMix, etc.   p  p2 Is it a lot easier and less resourceintensive effortwise and moneywise to consider SOA infrastructure right from the beginning or is it going to be almost the same even if we defer it to sometime later I just want to make sure that we do not overengineer and so I am not sure if SOA is an overkill or it really worth the time and investment, from the beginning  p  p3 Do SOA infrastructures offer better performance with High Scalability and Low Latency, as compared to deploying the web services independently just like any web application I sometimes wonder that doesnt all this additional infrastructure for SOA add to latency  p  p4 I have heard of several SOA infrastructures like Apache ServiceMix and Mule ESB, which I guess are opensource while there are other licensed solutions like the Oracle SOA suite, and IBM DataPower. Are they all equally good or is there any best choice I also wonder if ESBService Bus is a part of every SOA infrastructure or is it something different  p  p5 Do you have any other suggestionstips for me to consider as an WebServices and SOA Evangelist   p  p6 Does SpringIntegration provide any means for SOA Can you please direct me to some examples  p

Negative 370 pSo we are told that StringBuilder should be used when you are doing more than a few operations on a string Ive heard as low as three. Therefore we should replace thisp  precodestring s   foreach var item in items  where items is IEnumerableltstringgt     s  item codepre  pWith thisp  precodestring s  new StringBuilderitems.ToString codepre  pI assume that internally StringBuilder holds references to each Appended string, combining then on request. Lets compare this to the HybridDictionary, that uses a LinkedList for the first 10 elements, then swaps to a HashTable when the list grows more then 10. As we can see the same kind of pattern is here, small number of references  linkedList, else make ever increasing blocks of arrays.p  pLets look at how a List works. Start off with a list size internal default is 4. Add elements to the internal array, if the array is full, make a new array of double the size of the current array, copy the current arrays elements across, then add the new element and make the new array the current array.p  pCan you see my confusion as to the performance benefits For all elements besides strings, we make new arrays, copy old values and add the new value. But for strings thats bad because we know that a  b makes a new string reference from the two old references, a and b.p  pHope my question isnt too confusing. Why does there seem to be a double standard between string concatenation and array concatenation I know strings are arrays of charsp  pstrongStringstrong Making new references is badp  pstrongT  where T  Stringstrong Making new references is goodp  pemEditem Maybe what Im really asking here, is when does making new, bigger arrays and copying the old values across, start being faster than have references to randomly places objects all over the heapp  pemDouble editem By faster I mean reading, writing and finding variables, not inserting or removing i.e. LinkedList would kickass at inserting for example, but I dont care about that.p  pemFinal editem I dont care about StringBuilder, Im interested in the trade off in time taken to copy data from one part of the heap to another for cache alignments, vs just taking the cache misses from teh cpu and have references all over the heap. When does one become faster then the otherp

Negative 370 pI have a table which has a column named Permissionbinary8 whose every bit represents a specific operation permission.

Negative 370 pI have a dll and I even have the header files for the dll, but I dont have the implementation neither the lib file for the dll.

I suppose it can be solved both ways, but I dont know how.p  pWhen I overwrite my code.fadecode class with the below, my fading does not speed upp  precode.fade     opacity 0    webkittransition opacity 0.01s linear       moztransition opacity 0.01s linear        mstransition opacity 0.01s linear         otransition opacity 0.01s linear            transition opacity 0.01s linear  codepre  pIf I increased to e.g. code3.00scode, it slows down though...p  pIt seems like code.fadecode has to do with the process of adding backdrop. I wish to speed up the process of the modal traveling from the top of the screen to its final position. This process happens after the backdrop is added.p

Negative 370 pIve created a model that has mainly a nested array of custom objects for use in a splitview both UITableViews todo list type app. The left master is the lists of lists and the right detail is the lists  Some other variables are kept in some of the classes like isSelected, isExpanded...p  pAll of these classes implement NSCopying protocol. When I make a copy of a master list item and change the copys name that works, but if I change anything in the detail list item belonging to that master list item, it changes in both the copy and the original. So I guess my question is how do I create a deep copy of a master list item. I thought by making them all implement NSCopying protocol it would automatically do this.

Negative 370 pProbably on any OS it is possible to compile CC standard library statically or dynamically. On Windows I prefer static builds always, because it helps to avoid dll hell problem with different versions of libraries installed or not installed on specific Windows version, edition and service pack, etc. Static linking makes software more portable and less dependent on what end user did with his operating system I even saw examples when end user could make codeSHIFTDELcode on some DLLs in codesystem32code, he couldnt explain why, or when users claim that my app contains virus because it tried to download dynamically linked prerequisites from official Microsoft website... So, on Windows static linking is usually better than dynamic one in my experience. However, I am new to Linux, so can anyone share his experience My question is strongwhat kind of linking dynamic or static is preffered on Linux if we ignore the fact that dynamic one allows to save memory amp hard drive space and if we plan to distribute software with automated install programstrong hard drive space and memory are cheap enough now, so there are not reason to sacrifice hours of working time required to create really good and portable installer to win some megabytes of RAM or hard drive space. Are there any Linuxspecific issues with dynamicstatic linkingp

Negative 370 pIn our project raven costs many time for create and send message to Sentry. We checked out many time costs for create data about frames, but we dont need data about all frames often. Is it possible and how create data about not all frames just about last 23 frames before frame with exception or error and send it into sentry by raven. Or may be possible create dependency full stack  partly stack on message level i.e. in critical or exception or error level send full stack and in debug or warning levels just part of frames.p

Negative 370 pWe have a C code base that runs under Linux and has done so for quite some time.  As a result, some of the application code has POSIX calls scattered throughout.  New code tries to use boost where possible, but there are still many select clockgettime mmap and other calls in various places.p  pOn the other side of the world, another department is a Windows CE shop and has been for a long time were both in the industrial embedded space.  Said department wishes to use a portion of our code base, and I would like to work out the scope of what needs to be done to port.p  pNote this is all backend work  there is no GUI to speak of.p  pWithin Linux, the code is quite portable x86, x64, PowerPC and ARM are all targets, but clearly there will be some work porting to CE.

Negative 370 pThis is a very basic question I ran into when drawing with AS. Lets say I have the following code.p  precodeg.lineStyle20, 0xff0000, 1, false g.moveTo10, 10 g.lineTo210, 10    codepre  pBecause the line thickness is 20. This will actually draw a line as a rectangle from 0,0 to 220, 20. i.e. thickness2 will get added in each dimension.p  pI wanted to know if 1. This is correct or I got it wrong 2. So every time we need to draw line where we dont want it to be bound within something e.g. drawing an inside border we need to take this into account so the line would not go outside a particular an area. Is that also correctp

Annoying for breakpoints and stuff, so I resize it, debug, and...li liWhen I leave debug mode and go back to debug, the layout go back to what it was... except the separation which moved as wellli liAnd last but not least, if I close Visual Studio and open it again, my two file views are now expanded on both screens, separated horizontally emlt this one is new, I had never seen that beforeem.li ul  pEvery time I go to debug mode, or go back to design, I would resize it to fit my two screens. And then it would shift again at the next debug. After some time it shifts with a smaller amount of pixels. Then, it just stops shifting, as if it learned that it shouldnt change. Until at some point, it goes back to normal and forces me to resize again.p  pI tried to use addons such as strongPerspectivesstrong or strongLayout O Ramastrong , but they didnt keep any information about the two Code windows. No matter how I was saving them lets say, one would be 20 of the left screen, and the other would expand on 2 screens, it would ANYWAY go back to the strange, shifted layout. I also tried strongVisual Studio Productivity Power Toolstrong and its terrible. If I dock a code tab as a Window on my second screen, and dock for example the Find Results on it, it would be separated or reorganized every time I switch to DebugDesignp  pHas anyone experienced that yet Am I the only one feeling that my Visual Studio is a pet who will learn how to do his own layout as time goesp  pThank youp  pAlso, as an image is always better than a description, here are a few screenshotsp  pstrongHere, the normal, regular layout, with the red line being where my screens stop.

Negative 370 pI have an input array, which is a masked array.br When I check the mean, I get a nonsensical number less than the reported minimum valuep  pSo, raw array codenumpy.meanA lt numpy.minAcode. Note codeA.dtypecode returns codefloat32code.p  pFIX codeA3A.astypefloatcode. A3 is still a masked array, but now the mean lies between the minimum and the maximum, so I have some faith its correct Now for some reason codeA3.dtypecode is codefloat64code. Why Why did that change it, and why is it correct at 64 bit and wildly incorrect at 32 bitp  pCan anyone shed any light on why I emneededem to recast the array to accurately calculate the mean with or without numpy, it turns out.p  pEDIT Im using a 64bit system, so yes, thats why recasting changed it to 64bit. It turns out I didnt have this problem if I subsetted the data extracting from netCDF input using codenetCDF4 Datasetcode, smaller arrays did not produce this problem  therefore its caused by overflow, so switching to 64bit prevented the problem.br So Im still not clear on why it would have initially loaded as float32, but I guess it aims to conserve space even if it is a 64bit system. The array itself is code1872x128x256code, with nonmasked values around 300, which it turns out is enough to cause overflow p
Negative 370 pIm in the process of trying to determing if what Im seeing is solvable via code or is a bug in GridView Using Visual Studio 2012 PreimumSQL Server 2012  Patched to Current Standards with .NET 4.5 4.0 used in code.  Using Microsofts AdventureWorks2012 for dB information.p  pI have a GridView that sits inside of a panel the SQL Data is solid and works as I want it which has a Frozen Header with all the column names from  the database.  When the page loads, everything behaves as I want it.  However, when I go into edit mode the formatting that I set in non editing mode is gone and the panel that holds the GridView doesnt stretch out to fillshow the entire data and chops off a significant portion of the gridview. p  pI should also note the Freeze Pane still operates as normal. However, with the parts of the GridView that are cut off in edit mode this defeats the purpose of 1 the GridView and 2 the Freeze Pane.  I spent the better part of yesterday trying to figure out how I could apply the editing from initial page load to GridView editing mode.  I shouldnt have to do this but its something that needs to be done.  Ive been looking over the OnRowEditing Method as a possible answer as well as looking over the ASP options for GridView and Panel.  Ive even looked over the CSS to see if theres a solution but Im stumped.p  pWhat Im hoping to accomplish is to have the formatting that I like when the page loads stay uniform when the GridView goes into edit mode.  p  pHeres a sample of what Im seeing note how the GridView in the pane slidesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com10zti.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTBupa.jpg altenter image description herep  pYes, this is a sandbox database but what Im seeing on my actual code is more information being cut off than this on the end.p  pIm trying to learn this so some pointers on the theory behind this would be great as well.

Negative 370 pCurrently, this is more of a thought experiment.p  pSo, Im trying to write a recursive function, very basicp  precodeomnom ltfunction a.vector, n      if SOME.FUN a.vector          n ltn 1         omnom a.vector[1], n       return n   codepre  pThe function codeomnomcode takes a vector and a count variable and returns the number of elements in the vector i.e., codeomnomcode does the same thing as codelengthcode. It does this recursively by checking some condition  if its codeTRUEcode the function will add code1code to n and call itself with a reduced vector and the current state of codencode.p  pMy question What could I use for codeSOME.FUNcode I tried codeis.nullcode but if codeomnomcode has gobbled up all elements, codea.vectorcode will be codeinteger0code  which is not codeNULLcode. codea.vectorcode will be empty but I dont know any function which checks for emptiness. Similarly, codeinteger0 FALSEcode will return codelogical0code  which is, by the way, not codeFALSEcode, just like codeinteger0 TRUEcode. p  pEdit The type of data, Im trying to process is something along the lines ofp  precodea.vector ltc bla, 1010, yadayadayada codepre  pOf course, I could use codelengtha.vector 0code but that would be kind of pointless. Then again, the whole purpose of the function might seem pointless. Im trying to see what works and now that I did, Im wondering if or why there is no function which checks for emptiness. Also, since Im no programmer, I have no clue how I would even go about checking for emptiness.p

Negative 370 pI have recently finished solving the interesting codeHackerRankcode problem titled Conways Game Of Life. The problem statement is as followsp  blockquote   pGame of Life is a cellular automaton game devised by the British Mathematician John Horton Conway. The original game is a zero player   game. The evolution of it depends entirely on its input. p      pGame of life takes place on a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid will be   in one of the two possible states,p      pALIVE DEAD The birth or death of the cells is based on the following   rules.p      pA cell switches from DEAD to ALIVE if its surrounded exactly by 3   living cells. A cell remains alive if its surrounded by 2 or 3 living   cells. A cell switches from being ALIVE to DEAD if its surrounded by   more than 3 living cells because of over population. A cell switches   from being ALIVE to DEAD if its surrounded by less than 2 cells   because of under population. Each cell is surrounded by 8 cells, 4 on   its sides and 4 on its corners. Cells at the extreme corners have only   3 neighbors and the cells at the extreme right, left, top and bottom   of the board have 5 neighboring cells. The rules mentioned above   applies for these cells as well. p      pThis version of Game of Life takes place of a 29x29 grid, the top left   cell is 0,0 and the bottom right cell is 28,28. Its indexed as   row,column like arrays in Computer Science. Two players play against   each other. What differs this game from the original is that a cell   has 2 states when its ALIVE. The two states beingp      pWHITE BLACK The first rule differs.p      pWhen a cell switches from being DEAD to ALIVE, it assumes the color of   the majority of the 3 cells. Since 3 is odd, majority always exists.   Rest of the rules follow the original version of the game.  Initially,   all the cells are in DEAD state. The first player plays WHITE and the   second player plays BLACK. Each player take turns to switch one DEAD   cell to ALIVE state. The ALIVE cell takes the color assigned to the   player. This goes on till each player has placed 40 cells of their   respective colors on the grid. The game then starts. The alive cells   of the maximum color at the end of 500 life cycles wins the gamep      pInput Formatp      pThe 1st player is represented by the character w ascii value 119 and   the 2nd player is represented by the character b ascii value 98.   First line of the input represents the character of the player. 29   lines follow. Each line has 29 characters without any spaces between   them. Alive cells are represented by their respective characters and   the dead cells are represented by  ascii value 45.p      pOutputp      pOutput is 2 single spaced integers which indicates the position the   cell which needs to be switched from DEAD to ALIVE.p blockquote  pThere is a sample input and sample output, along with more details, at the official problem site here a hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesconway relnofollowhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesconwayap  pI was wondering what algorithms other hackers used. Im right now right around the bottom of the list  any other perspective would be extremely useful. p

Negative 370 pstrongHeres the scenariostrongp  pI am using Nicecast on OS X to encode an MP3 stream from microphone input, and sending it to an Ubuntu computer running Icecast2 streaming server. The streaming server is connected just to my LAN not the internet via WiFi router. The stream is listened to by iOS devices, Android devices, Windows Phones, Windows computers, Mac computers, etc. most use VLC. p  pThe stronglatencystrong from the microphone pickup to the audio playing through the clients speakers is about strong12 secondsstrong. This is ok for my application.p  pHowever, when there is network congestion or the clients CPU is busy doing something else, or any number of reasons, the stream stops breaks for a few seconds, then when all is back to normal, Icecast sends a blast of data to get caught back up to real time again. The clients buffer receives this blast of data and stores it as it should and starts playing again where it left off which is also good, because it means no audio content was lost or missed, which is what I need for my application. But now the stronglatencystrong is about strong45 secondsstrong.p  pstrongI need to keep the delay to around 12 secondsstrong. So I thought if I could just speed up the playback to 1.5x, for example, after a few seconds, wed be back to the 12 second latency.  In other words, if buffer has x amount of data in it, playback at 1.0x speed. If buffer reaches y amount of data or more, playback at 1.5x speed until buffer is back to x amount of data. A kind of strongdynamic playback speedstrong is there a better or correct name for this.p  pSo, my questionsp  ol listrongCould I use VLC client to provide this solutionstrongli listrongAre there other stream clients that could handle this wellstrong especially ones that work on multiple platformsli listrongOr are there other streaming platforms that handle this automatically, or with a little configurationstrongli ol  pAny thoughts amp comments would be much appreciated Thanksp

If it does, I would like to return the control itself as an object as the function value that is passed to the rest of the program.p  pHeres my workp  precode Public Function getcontrolTypeOptional ByVal controlString As String  , Optional ByVal parentCtrl As Control  Nothing As System.Object     Dim returnValue As System.Object     If parentCtrl Is Nothing Then         parentCtrl  MainModelForm     End If     For Each ctrl As Control In parentCtrl.Controls         If ctrl.HasChildren Then             getcontrolTypecontrolString, ctrl         End If         If ctrl.Name  controlString Then             returnValue  ctrl.Name             Return returnValue         End If     Next     Return Cant find control End Function codepre  pThe issue Im running into is that the program executes correctly to the point of assigning the returnValue to the ctrl.Name, and then it executes the Return statement and then goes to the End Function. From there though, the code doesnt actually exit the function and instead jumps back to the getcontrolTypecontrolString, ctrl line. Im sure there has to be something off with my iteration computers are only as smart as you tell them to be, but I dont understand why it would go to the End Function line and then jump back into the code p  pThanks for any and all help p

Negative 370 pAfter nearly six hours of trial and error, I am unable to come up with a solution for my problem  I have built this before, but lack access to old files to see what I did, and have been in a different career path for years now and unfortunately my skill has faded a bit. p  pI am setting up a website to chronicle my time at sea for work, and it will have  a header that is 150px tall and 100 wide  a nav bar that is 30px tall and 100 wide  an aside that is 250px wide and stretches fully between the nav bar and footer, regardless of how little content there is in it  an article div, that will be to the right of the aside that fills the remaining space left over depending on how wide the viewport is  a footer that is at least to the bottom of the page if the content does not fill the viewport, or if the text flows beyond the limits of the viewport, it will be below that. I do not want an always visible footer. p  pI am using HTML5 and CSS3 along with ASP.net 4.5. p  pI currently have the header, navigation, and article working the way I want. However, I am not sure how to approach the aside and footer. p  pI want the footer to be at the bottom of the page. Obviously, if I have a page without much text on it, it will be halfway up the browser screen, and that, as we all know, looks amateur and ridiculous. So I would like it to be at the bottom of the screen, like a normal webpage. And while I am at it, I would also like my aside to fill the 250px wide strip on the left hand of the browser window regardless of how much content is in it too, all the way to the footer so it looks more complete. p  pNow, as I pointed out, for the last six hours I have been plugging away and have made some serious headway with this, but these two issues I just cant seem to get ironed out. I have used this forum for help, and have exhausted nearly everything without success. Its frustrating to know I have done this numerous times before in just a few minutes, but here I am at 4 am. p  pHere is the CSSp  precode           margin 0  body       margin 0px auto     height 100   form, html      height 100   header      margin 0px auto      backgroundcolor 1041a2     backgroundimage url..ImagesheaderHCJ.png     backgroundrepeat norepeat     backgroundpositionx right     height 150px     position relative   logo      margin 0px auto     float left     height 150px     width 150px     backgroundimage url..ImagesusmmSeal130.png     backgroundrepeat norepeat     backgroundposition center    title      margin 0px auto     color white     position absolute     bottom 45px     paddingleft 150px   title h1      margin 0px auto     fontfamily Arial     textshadow 5px 5px 5px black   title h2      margin 0px auto     fontfamily Arial     textshadow 5px 5px 5px black   nav      backgroundimage url..Imagesnav.png     fontfamily Arial     color white     backgroundrepeat repeatx     height 30px     width 100     lineheight 30px     margin 0px auto    content       margin 0px auto     height 100   aside       margin 180px 0px 80px 0px auto     float left     width 250px     backgroundcolor gray     height 100   article      margin 0px auto     paddingleft 250px     minheight 100   footer      height80px     background black     clear both  codepre  pand here is my HTMLp  precodeltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt         ltheadergt             ltdiv idlogogt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idtitlegt              ltdivgt         ltheadergt         ltnavgt          ltnavgt         ltdiv idcontentgt             ltasidegt                 Vessel data             ltasidegt             ltarticlegt                 ltaspContentPlaceHolder IDContentPlaceHolder1 runatservergt                 ltaspContentPlaceHoldergt             ltarticlegt         ltdivgt         ltfootergt          ltfootergt     ltformgt ltbodygt codepre  pp  pThank you all so much for your feedback. p  pEDIT I am very close to a solution. I have modified my code so that the aside and article are contained in a div, and set the aside to minheight of 100, after making changes to the form, html, and body elements. It now is expanded to 100 percent of the viewport, with one problem. It LITERALLY is 100 the height of the viewport RATHER than 100 of the height of the container div. The headernav bar occupy 180px at the top of the page, and the footer occupies 80px at the bottom. The page will scroll 240 px regardless of the size of the viewport. My initial fix for that was to add margin 180px 0px 80px 0px auto. This however, did not solve the problem. Code above is edited to reflect changes. p

Negative 370 pI am wondering what the standard layoutformat is for an ObjectiveC interface .h file. I know what components are present within this file, but I have seen them laid out in many different ways. p  pA lot of the components of an interface file are pretty obvious like the codeimportcode, codeclasscode, etc. But for something like the codeprotocolcode and codeinterfacecode declarations it can be different. I have seen people declare a new protocol above the interface declaration with its implementation of methods belowp  precodeprotocol MyNewClassDelegate  interface MyNewClass  UIViewController   Properties and Methods  end  protocol MyNewClassDelegate ltNSObjectgt   voidmethod  end codepre  pThe other way that Ive seen it is by just having the entire codeprotocolcode declaration and implementation above the codeinterfacecode statement. So itd be something like thisp  precodeprotocol MyNewClassDelegate ltNSObjectgt   voidmethod  end  interface MyNewClass  UIViewController  Properties and Methods  end codepre  pI have also seen it setup where one protocol is declared and implemented above the interface while another one is also declared and implemented below. p  pMy question is which one is preferred or is a standard in the industry Is there some kind of way you organize it based around what its functionality accomplishes p

Negative 370 pI need to write code which inserts instructions into a method at a specified position. The way that I specify the position is by providing the number of the instruction immediately before it. The idea is to visit all instructions until the number of the instruction equals the specified number so the first instruction is the 0th instruction, the next instruction is the first instruction, etc., which, at that point, the instructions that I want to inject will be injected. The problem is that there is no generic visit instruction method in the codeMethodVisitorcode class it only has methods for visiting specific type of instructions, so I cannot figure out an elegant way of visiting the emnthem instruction. Here is what I came up with parts left out for brevityp  precodeprivate int counter  0  Override public void visitIincInsnint arg0, int arg1      super.visitIincInsnarg0, arg1     if checkInstruction              insertInstructions        Override public void visitInsnint arg0      super.visitInsnarg0     if checkInstruction              insertInstructions        Override public void visitIntInsnint arg0, int arg1      super.visitIntInsnarg0, arg1     if checkInstruction              insertInstructions         And continue, implementing every method which visits a specific type of instruction.   private boolean checkInstruction      return counter  instructionNumber  codepre  pThe problem I have with this solution is that it repeats a lot of code, and requires me to implement a bunch of methods whose purpose I have no intention of modifying. Plus, if new types of instructions are added, I would have to modify this code again just to implement that specific type of instruction.p  pDoes anyone have a better solutionp

Negative 370 pstrongemEconometric Backgroudemstrongp  pFama Macbeth regression refers to a procedure to run regression for panel data where there are N different individuals and each individual corresponds to multiple periods T, e.g. day, months,year. So in total there are N x T obs. Notice its OK if the panel data is not balanced. p  pThe Fama Macbeth regression is to first run regression for each period crosssectinally, i.e. pool N individuals together in a given period t. And do this for t1,...T. So in total T regressions are run. Then we have a time series of coefficients for each independent variable. Then we can perform hypothesis test using the time series of coefficients. Usually we take the average as the final coefficients of each independent variable. And we use tstats to test significance.p  pstrongemMy Problememstrongp  pMy problem is to implement this in pandas. From the source code of pandas, I noticed there is a procedure called codefamamacbethcode. But I cant find any documentation about this. p  pThe operation can be easily done through codegroupbycode as well. Currently I am doing thisp  precodedef fmregdata,formula     return smf.olsformula,datadata.fit.params[1]  resdf.groupbydate.applyfmreg,retvar1 codepre  pThis works, coderescode is a Series which is indexed by codedatecode and the values of Series are codeparams[1]code, which is the coefficient of codevar1code. But now I want to have more independent variables, I need to extract the coefficients of all these independent variables, but I cant figure that out. I tried thisp  precodedef fmregdata,formula     return smf.olsformula,datadata.fit.params  resdf.groupbydate.applyfmreg,retvar1var2var3 codepre  pThis wont work. The desired result is that coderescode is a dataframe indexed by codedatecode, and each column of the dataframe should contain the coefficients of each variable codeinterceptcode, codevar1code, codevar2code and codevar3code.p  pI also checked with codestatsmodelscode, they dont have such builtin procedure as well.p  pAnd is there any package that can produce publicationquality regression tables Like codeoutreg2code in Stata and codetexregcode in R Thanks for your help p

As I am about to start the application, have a doubt on how to change the theme of an application on the fly or with minimum changes involved so that I can use the same app with different themes for different client.p  pPlease let me know is there a configuration or common place available to updatechange the theme of an entire application at any moment during the development.p  pEDIT sorry to confuse a bit, the question is with how to switch between the themes provided by default by jquery mobile like a, b, c, d and e without doing any or much code change.p  pThanks.p

Negative 370 pI am actually looking to do a couple things on a page. I need certain text fields to update every so often and pull information I have stored in a database. I am using PHP within javascript to test or JS in PHP. I want these fields to update without users refreshing the page. I have looked at a few examples of people asking similar questions, but I dont understand how to implement it for my needs.

Under some circumstance which I have not been able to pinpoint, handleTap stops getting called for the subview, and the parents handleTap gets called instead.  However, even though handleTap stops getting called, touchesBegan and touchedEnded continue to get called for the subview.  I have ensured that the UITapGestureRecognizer is still in the subviews gestureRecognizers array.  I have also ensured that the userInteractionEnabled property for the subview is YES.  Is there some known condition or state of the UIView where we would expect this behaviorp

Cloning seems to fail in part because the target structure appears to be a mix of object and array, but moreover because what are claimed to be clones generally maintain references to the original data, meaning changes to one are reflected in the other.

The hover events for the CSS are loaded just fine, but click on the tab does nothing. However, if I click one tab and nothing happens, I can click on the next and it will work fine. Similarly, if I click anywhere in the main content frame first and then on a tab, it will always fire the event handler.p  pWeve noticed this problem happening almost entirely when we try to direct to the tabbed page from the parent frame we have a quicksearch up there and we use a Response.Redirect to load the iframe with the tab page. Ive tried redirecting this quicksearch to a landing page inside the iframe that then uses a Response.Redirect to get us to the tab page, but it ends up with the same results. When were clicking on a hyperlink from inside the iframe Targetself, that works just fine.p  pThis issue doesnt happen in Firefox, Chrome, or IE7, but it does in IE9.p  pDoes anybody have any thoughts, ideas, known bugs that Im missing, anything like thatp
Negative 370 pHaving a 1bit black amp white halftone image as input, I need to extract the angle used for positioning the dots, as shown in the example belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combRZpa.png altHalftone screen with detected imagesp  pMy intented approach is to identify all isolated areas below a certain threshold I can assume all dots are in a 20x20 area and make a list of all center points of these dots. The second step is to run a Hough transform on these specific points to find the interesting angles. The main problem is that this seems to generate quite a lot of points, making the Hough transform i slow and ii giving false positives, which need filtering out in turn.p  pI cant help but have the feeling that I am overcomplicating things and I am overlooking a simple elegant solution to this problem. Any ideas or approaches that I may have overlookedp

Negative 370 pOne of the most powerful things about VB is ability to loop through objects in a collection WITHOUT referring to the index  codefor eachcode loop.p  pI find it very useful only want to remove objects from a collection.p  pWhen doing removing objects from a predefined such as rows on a spread sheet the code is simpler if I use indexing and start at the largest and work back to the first. Step 1 with an iterator otherwise requires an offset as the For each moves the enumerator pointer back to the previous object once the active one is deletedp  peg.p  precodeFor intA  10 to 1 step 1       ...

Negative 370 pEDIT The problem was that my View Models were not public, so the bindings were not found. For some reason they need to be public in Silverlight, even though private view models work for WPF.

Negative 370 pI understand that a LINQ provider is the thing that transforms the actual LINQ query into a SQL query or whatever. It does so by traversing the AST of the LINQ query, and rendering an appropriate SQL query. So far, so good.p  pNow I can imagine that this works for simple C code, such asp  precodewhere person.Age gt 18 codepre  pwhich can be mostly directly translated to SQL. But what if I provide arbitrary complex C code, such asp  precodewhere person.Name.StartsWithperson.Age lt 25  X  Y codepre  pThere is no equivalent to this in SQL, so what does the LINQ provider do in such a casep

Negative 370 pIm getting very confused about whether C marshals COM objects between threads.  To this end I have an application which is loading a set of files in a task parallel fashion.  Im using the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive201004079990421.aspx relnofollowStaTaskScehdulera to load the files using the COM object.  Once the COM object is loaded I am storing the object in a central list.p  pI then later try to perform some processing on this data, again using the STATaskScheduler.

I receive an exception as followsp  precodeAn unhandled exception of type System.Runtime.InteropServices.InvalidComObjectException occurred in MadCat.exe  Additional information COM object that has been separated from its underlying RCW cannot be used codepre  pNow my understanding is that I receive this error because the object hasnt been marshalled into the new thread.  I thought this was something C does for youp  pHow can I create an apartment threaded COM object in one thread and then use it from another threadp  pAm I barking up the wrong tree here Should I not even be using the Sta apartment for my threads  I can guarantee that the object is never access from multiple threads simultaneously.  Any thoughts much appreciated.p  pstrongemEditemstrong  The COM object is defined as followsp  precode[     coclass,     threading apartment ,     viprogid [Namespace.Class] ,     progid [Namespace.Class].6 ,     version 6.0 ,     uuid GUIDC[Class] ,     helpstring [Class] Class  ] codepre  pSo by my understanding this is an apartment threaded object, right  Ive just tried using a modified task scheduler that doesnt set the apartment state MTA by default.

And I need to build the TableViewCell from the storyboard easy to visualize. I am stuck with the storyboard part. How do I place a TableViewCell on the storyboard without a TableView to place it in I had an idea, I tried it, but it didnt work. Here is what I did. I placed a nevertobeused TableViewController in the storyboard whose sole purpose is to hold my CustomTableViewCell. Then in code I subclass TableViewCell and use IBOutlet to link the subviews of the storyboard TableViewCell to my CustomTableViewCell . And then I used my cell as codeCustomTableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier forIndexPathindexPath]code. This didnt work. The tableView remained blank. And my guess for the failure is that codeCustomTableViewCellcode does not belong to the codetableViewcode being dequeued from.pli lipI need the UISearchBar to always stay inside the NavigationBar. But so far codeself.searchDisplayController.displaysSearchBarInNavigationBar  YEScode is not doing it. When I first start the app the searchBar is inside the NavigationBar.

All of my code works fine for the most part, Im just not sure how I can transition my ofstream variable from the main, into my binary operators since I cant pass them.p  pOne idea I had was to make all arithmetic operators have no cout statements im still new to classes and overloading operators, is it generally not recommended to include cinout statements within overloaded binary operators  And make all cout statements in an output function that could accept the ostream variable as an arguement.   p  pEDITp  pMy apologies, I should have been a little more clear.p  pMy program has to write everything that the user sees on screen from input to output to the file, not just the results.p

Negative 370 pI am currently working on a build script for a system using powershell 2.0 and MSBuild. The basic idea is that our librarian can double click and build it in its various configurations. Unfortunately, for contract reasons, we have to configure the project with preprocessor directives and some configurations require several different constants to be defined, which we do by using powershell to generate a command such asp  precodemsbuild.exe thing.sln pDefineConstantsFOOBAR tRebuild codepre  pThat works fine and dandy until it hits a vb project this thing is a monolithic mass of vb, c, c and C. Than I get an error likep  blockquote   pFOO     BAR is not valid Character is not validp blockquote  pI am assuming it has to do with VB.NET liking its preprocessor constants colon separated rather than semi colon seperated. My questions isare then Is there a language agnostic at least VBCCC agnostic way to define these preprocessor constants through DefineConstants  If so, how would I go about itp

Negative 370 pI am fresh to C from Java, and am currently in the process of figuring things out. I need some advice on something that I am implementing its for a simulation, and will essentially be a bunch of methods for translating between real time and simulation time e.g. one of them will allow the user to specify a duration in simulation time, and the method will return the equivalent value in real time. There will also be a single field, which will be the length of a simulated day in real time  seconds.p  pI can think of a few ways to implement thisp  ol liEverything that uses these methods which in turn use that variable will descend from a single superclass. So, I could use a namespace to hold the methods and make the day length variable a field of the superclass.li liMake the day length variable global and use a namespace to hold the methodsli liHave a utility class, as I probably would in Java if I had toli ol  pWhat do you think is the best option If anyone can think of a better option than the ones listed here that would be welcome, too  Id love to learn more about C.p

Negative 370 pI apologize in advance if this has been asked before but unfortunately I cant seem to find an answer  maybe I used the wrong terms while searching.p  pHowever. I am building a very simple website to display my portfolio and I decided to put a fixed sidebar on the left and the main contents scrolling on the right.

Negative 370 pThe sp is used to add an additional unit to an existing customer. There are three tables used.

Negative 370 pIve hit a brick wall. I have the view file  codeheader.phpcode that I want to use on all pages of a site. In this file I want to output codetotalitemscode, the value of which is the same as codetotalitemscode in my codegetTotalItemscode method that I have in a controller codeItemscode.

I understand this is down to the set up of my URL routing e.g. codelocalhostsomemvcprojectcontrolleractionparam1param2param3code etc and that I have not created a controller called header per say. But how can I access codetotalitemscode or for that matter any other variable from codeItemscode codegetTotalItemscode for a view that is essentially unrelated. p  pThe only thing close to a work around I have is loading codeItemsModelcode in each controller every time I wish to include header.php otherwise codetotalitemscode is an undefined variable.

Negative 370 pIm using R to fit a separate ANOVA model for each column of a matrix, using codestatsaovcode.

Negative 370 pI am having a Batch program Program to insert  update  query Database schedule using Java Timer to trigger one time a day.  This Batch program runs in two different servers in apache tomcat. p  pNow My problem is that Java Timer API triggering the job parallely in both the servers, due to which my program getting executed twice, hence I am getting same record processed twice, with different Primary Key.p  pI need to make sure that my program triggers only once, that triggering should be happening dynamically irrespective of servers. Once one Batch is started others should not get started or other should not get processed.p  pHere,  Tomcat is hosted in two servers each has same application deployed in it I am having one Database which is shared by both the servers.p  pJava and spring is used.p  pNeed suggestion  help in solution for the above problem.p

I saw the ShareJS project, and their attempts to support rich text collaboration on the browser on codecontenteditablescode elements. Nowhere in ShareJS I see any attempt to use CRDT for that. p  pWe also know that Google Docs is using OT and its working pretty well for realtime edition of rich documents. Is Googles choice of using OT because CRDT was not very known at that time Or would it be a good choice today toop  pIm also interested to hear about other use cases too, like using these algorithms on databases. Riak seems to use CRDT. Can OT be used to sync nodes of a database too and be an alternative to PaxosZabRaftp

Negative 370 pI have a requirement to display an error page in my JSF application when certain HTTP errors or Java exceptions are encountered and provide the user with a form on the error page which they can use to report the error as a possible bug. At the same time I need ensure that the error page is only displayed in response to a real application error and not as a result of the user accessing the error page directly by typing in the URL and potentially submitting spurious bug reports.p  pI have tried locating the error pages in WEBINF which prevents the user from accessing the page directly, however the HTTP post method on the form fails when the user tries to submit the bug report.p  pA quick search on StackOverflow shows that there are several similar questions, however none of them relate to the use case I am trying to meet. The closest question I have found is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10994666howtodetectwhetheruserhavereachedapagebyjsfnavigationruleredirectoHow to detect whether user have reached a page by JSF navigation rule redirect or by typing the URLa which suggests checking the referer request header but says that overzealous proxyfirewallsecurity software can hide the referer header so I dont believe this is the correct solution for this requirement.p  pIn summary my question is.... What is the best way to ensure that an error page which contains a form is only displayed when a real application error has occurred and not due to the user typing in the URLp  pNote This question is following on from another question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26681640isitpossibletosubmitaformthathasbeenrenderedfromajsfpagelocationIs it possible to submit a form that has been rendered from a JSF page location in WEBINFa I asked on StackOverflow but I didnt get any answers, so Im hoping that by not constraining the question as I did previously I might get some responses.p

Negative 370 pFor a website were working on, we had a pretty complex design to support. So, we chose the strategy where all content on each page is made up of components. Authors can insert various components such as a heading, rich text block, images, etc, allowing them flexibility in laying out pages. This was the only away we could support the complex design that was created.p  pThis set up is working well except when it comes to versioning and search. When pages are versioned, the components on the page are not. When items are indexed for search, the components on the pages are not being indexed as part of the page. We think we may be able to solve the search issue with a  custom search index, but the versioning issue seems much more complex. p  pHas anyone else faced these issues or have thoughts on solutions Were on Sitecore 7.5.p

Negative 370 pIm new to working in Android, and Im not sure if I wrote myself into a corner or if Im just not seeing the solution either is likely. I have an intentservice which sets repeating alarms based on those times a user saves. When the alarms go off, the intention is to display a notification that if the user taps on will send off an implied intent for a maps app and fills out the Start and End points with addresses the user saves, so they can run a search and check their commute times.p  pMy question is that Im unsure how to write the onHandleIntent method so that the implied map intent with the correct Start and End points packaged in the extras, based on which alarm is being sent. Does it have to do with the request codes set in pending intents, or is it as simple as creating two notifications in their own if blocks, checking for intent extras Again, Im unsure and would appreciate some help.

Negative 370 pI come along with an a bit curious question. I dont have much experience with large projects with lots of files in C, C, C, D...p  pSo I wondered about a professional solution when building up bigger projects. Obviously there is no general solution to do that.. To explain what I mean lets take a look at Java for examplep  pAssuming that you wrote a lot of source files in Java. Once you have finished you compile all that sources to .class files into a folder named like the package of the sources. All the files interact with each other. To finish your project you create a .jar file of all your .class files and configfiles and youre done. Just to simplify.p  pSo my question is What is a common solution when building GUI applications with C or C on windows Is there one .exe file and a lot of .dll files in a folder Or are all files compiled to .exe and work fine together due to namespaces for example Is there a way to create an executable archive of all files What is a common way to build up GUI applications with lots of frames Is there anyp  pI hope all that questions make my problem become more clearly. I hope you can guess what I mean.p  pThanks for any helpp

Has anybody got a solutionp  pBelow is a simplified version of my code.p  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodelt[if mso]gtltgt lttable idshowonmobile  cellpadding0 cellspacing0  style width 0  maxheight 0  overflow hidden  float left  visibility hidden  displaynone  lineheight0gt          lttrgt             lttd idshowonmobile             classbottomnav             width650             stylewidth 0             maxheight 0             overflow hidden             float left             visibility hidden             displaynone             lineheight0gt             lttable             idshowonmobile             classbottomnav             cellpadding0             cellspacing0             width100             stylewidth 0             maxheight 0             overflow hidden             float left             visibility hidden             displaynone             lineheight0gt              lttrgt                 lttd classnav1 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolor4A6175gtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                 lttd classnav2 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolor4A6175gtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                 lttd classnav3 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolor4A6175gtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                  lttd classnav4 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolor4A6175gtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                  lttd classnav5 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolor4A6175gtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                 lttd classnav6 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolor4A6175gtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                 lttd classnav7 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolorffffffgtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt                 lttd classnav8 aligncenter stylepadding 15px 6px fontfamily arial,sansserif fontsize 12px fontweight bold backgroundcolorffffffgtlta href title styletextdecorationnone color ffffffgtltagtlttdgt              lttrgt            lttablegtlttdgt          lttrgt        lttablegt       ltlt[endif]gt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode    [idshowonmobile]          displayblock important         visibility visible important         width  auto important         maxheight inherit important         overflow  visible important         float  none important               Mobile Bottom Nav        td[classbottomnav]          padding 0px 0          td[classbottomnav] td          display block         float left         padding 0 important         width 50          td[classbottomnav] a          display block         padding 30px 0         background 4A6175         fontsize15px      codepre

Negative 370 pIve looked around a bit but havent found a definitive answer to this.p  pPresently I like to develop new web site features in Drupal but I think this is relevant to other web development projects where all the code and supporting images are wrapped up into a branch that is dedicated to the particular feature.  This is so I can easily deploy the work to staging environments for review before deployment to the production environment.  From various sources Ive read it seems like putting images into the repository is generally not advisable yet I dont really see an alternative that doesnt involve a lot of extra legwork. Basically my current philosophy is everything thats involved in the frontend gets committed and resources like PDFs and other binaries that are not involved with the actual operation of the site are maintained in an ignored directory, which I sync as needed with rsync or FTP.p  pAm I missing some feature of Git that would solve this or is this just what web developers that use Git do  accept that images get maintained in the repositoryp  pRelated to this but sort of a different question when I commit an image but then subsequently delete it in a future commit is its bulk still an irreversible part of the repositorys historyp  pThanksp

Negative 370 pAs far as I understood the Akka documentation, an Akka ActorSystem contains its own thread pool to execute actors. I use Akka in a Java application that also uses Java8 futures the latter are executed by the ForkJoinPool.commonPool. So, actors and futures use different pools, which may defeat certain assumptions hidden in the two schedulers e.g. the Akka scheduler might assume that futures are run on the Akka pool. Could this create any performance problemsp

Negative 370 pSo Ive got a video playing on large displays 1200px and the opacity reduced on it so that the background color of the container div shows through. Question is, how can I hide the background image at large displays so that you can see it peeking through the semi opaque video p  pI tried using the desktop large min1200px media query to target the div and overwrite the background image with backgroundimagenone and its not working. I even tried switching it to a new image at desktop large thats not working eitherp  pAny suggestions Thanks in advance.

Negative 370 pI apologize for the rather vague title, I couldnt think of a good way to describe this issue.

The problem is its not doing that, in the example above if I input those the final result would be 2229, even though it should be 2329. I cant think of a better way to describe it, but Ive been staring at this code for an hour trying to figure out whats wrong with it, and being a beginner I cant quite figure it out.p

Negative 370 pI am using Jersey 1.19 to implement a rest api and Jackson to provide JSON support. My resource entities are deeply nested and I want to flatten them out before sending them over. I also want to provide support for filtering based on query params. Example codeGET users1234code returns the whole user resource while codeGET users1234filterusername,emailcode will return the user resource with only the given fields included. p  pThe approach I have currently taken is a subclass of codeJsonSerializercode which flattens the hierarchy, but cannot handle parameter based filtering as it is independent of the requestresponse cycle. Google search pointed me to codeMessageBodyWritercode. Looks like what I need but the a hrefhttpsjersey.java.netapidocs1.19jerseyjavaxwsrsextMessageBodyWriter.htmlwriteToT,20java.lang.Class,20java.lang.reflect.Type,20java.lang.annotation.Annotation[],20javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType,20javax.ws.rs.core.MultivaluedMap,20java.io.OutputStream relnofollowwriteTo methoda which handles the serializing doesnt take any parameter that would let me access the request, and hence the query params. So I am confused how to access those params in this method.p  pAny ideas are welcomep

As you see, loop should go on until there are no more intervals left in the collection, but there is a problem. In the beginning of each iteration an interval gets removed from collection and in the end some number of intervals might get added back into same collection. p  pProblem is, that while one thread is inside the loop the collection might become empty, so other threads that are trying to enter the loop wont be able to do that and will finish their work prematurely, even though collection emmightem be filled with values after the first thread will finish the iteration. I want the thread count to remain constant or not more than some number n until all work is really finished. p  pThat means that no threads are currently working in the loop and there are no elements left in the collection. What are possible ways of accomplishing that Any ideas are welcomed.p  pOne way to solve this problem in my specific case is to give every thread a different piece of the original collection. But after one thread would finish its work it wouldnt be used by the program anymore, even though it could help other threads with their calculations, so I dont like this solution, because its important to utilize all cores of the machine in my problem.p  pThis is the simplest minimal working example I could come up with.

Work is finished after no intervals are left. Also, I should be able to limit number of threads that are doing this work with some number n. The actual program looks for a maximum value of some function by dividing the intervals and throwing away the parts of those intervals that cant contain the maximum value using some rules, but this shouldnt really be relevant to my problem.p

Since Im relatively new to programming, Im not too sure how to go about this. This is what I had actually tried in the printQueens part of the codep  precodepublic static void printQueensint[] q      int N  q.length     for int i  0 i lt N i          for int j  0 j lt N j              if q[i]  j                 int[] rowPos  new int[1j]                 System.out.printArrays.toStringrowPos                    System.out.println           System.out.println  codepre  pAs you can see, under the if statement I made a new array I hoped would contain the row numbers in which the queens were in, then I wanted to print that out as a string. I am getting errors on this, though, and I have no idea why. I know the output Im trying to get isnt going to look like x,y,z, for instance, but Im just trying to print the rows where the Queens are at this point, then worry about the commas and parentheses later. However, if you can help me with any of that, it would be great. Heres how the errors looked likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYdlfk.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comYdlfk.pngp  pEDIT I made the necessary changes, but now my output looks like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comiiPtO.png relnofollow1ap  pNot sure why its printing it based on the number of rows the arrays has.

Negative 370 pI have a package with about 40 data flow tasks from flat files to Teradata tables, each with exec SQL tasks in their onPostExecute events, and I need to add new exec SQL tasks before each data flow task to look up the path to the source flat file and store it in a variable for the connection instead of having the path hardcoded.

It asked about creating a new connection manager, which I didnt want to do.  I tried promoted my existing connection manager to the project level.

In my interpretation at line codeONEcode I define a variant datatype that can take different values with codesqlite3 code among them. At lines codeTHREEcode I define codePythoncode stuff responsible for converting variables and passing them between codeCcode and codePythoncode. However, I get into trouble when I try to use this module in codePythoncode. I do it likep  precodegtgtgt import corm gtgtgt c  corm.ORM...initialization parameters... gtgtgt r  c.Connect  ERROR ...

Negative 370 pShort question Should I put logic, such as a navigation, into a template, to make life easierp  pI should also say that its not just a simple navigation, with some ifelses. Its a more complicated navigation that takes specific categories and gets the links.p  hr  pLong questionp  pIm using Redaxo, a CMS, which uses templates and modules to build a site. You create an article, then select a template for it, and fill it with modules.p  pIm now having a decision problem, because of a use case we are having. We have multiple about 100 articles, that use the same template and are divided into four categories. Every article should have the four top level categories as a navigation.p  pHowever, we use the same navigation style somewhere else. Thats why I built a module, that you insert into the articles to generate such a navigation.p  pHowever, the people in our company dont want to insert this module into every article, because this means a lot of work and asked me if I can put this directly into the template. However, as Ive learned, I should split logic from the view.p  pIn my case, my understanding is thatp  pClasses  Modelbr Modules  Controllerbr Templates  Viewsp  pWould that be correct If yes, then would it not be bad practice to put the logic for a navigation into the template, just to make it easierp
