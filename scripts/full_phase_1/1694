Positive 1694 pIm trying to create a before insert trigger in MySql, where I want several statements to be executed. Basically what Im trying to accomplish is thisp  pI have several 1015 inputs being fed into the Db on a set time interval Lets call these RVALUE1 to RVALUE4. Before they are inserted, the average from the last 60 entries are calculated and put in AVGVALUE1 to AVGVALUE4. This works fine when being put in a trigger by itself.p  pIm also looking to remove any entries where the values are zero, by means of moving them to a secondary table and removing it from the main table. This is done by a insert into followed by a delete.p  pThe thing is, these two well, three operations work fine by themselves when put in triggers, but not when put together. What happens is that the Db is refusing to accept any inputs, and once I remove the trigger the data resumes coming in. p  pIve also tried separating them byp  blockquote   ul   liAverage calculation before, move and delete in an after insert trigger. li   liAverage calculation and move before, delete operation in an before insert trigger on the secondary table.li   liPutting the move and delete part into a procedure, and calling it after the average calculation.li   liPutting the average calculation in an before insert trigger on maintable, the move from maintable to maintabledump in an after insert trigger on maintable, and the delete in an after insert trigger on maintabledump. Data kept coming in with these three active, but once I added a zero value  the data flow stopped.li   ul blockquote  pSame results on all these.p  pAny ideas See below for the trigger code.p  precodeDELIMITER   CREATE TRIGGER beforeinsert BEFORE INSERT ON maintable FOR EACH ROW  BEGIN  SET new.AVGVALUE1  SELECT avgRVALUE1 FROM  SELECT RVALUE1 from maintable ORDER BY DateTime DESC LIMIT 60 as VALUE1A, new.AVGVALUE2  SELECT avgRVALUE2 FROM  SELECT RVALUE2 from maintable ORDER BY DateTime DESC LIMIT 60 as VALUE2A, new.AVGVALUE3  SELECT avgRVALUE3 FROM  SELECT RVALUE3 from maintable ORDER BY DateTime DESC LIMIT 60 as VALUE3A, new.AVGVALUE4  SELECT avgRVALUE4 FROM  SELECT RVALUE4 from maintable ORDER BY DateTime DESC LIMIT 60 as VALUE4A  INSERT INTO maintabledump SELECT  FROM maintable WHERE RVALUE1  0 OR RVALUE2  0 OR RVALUE3  0 OR RVALUE4  0  DELETE FROM maintable WHERE RVALUE1  0 OR RVALUE2  0 OR RVALUE3  0 OR RVALUE4  0  END  DELIMITER  codepre  pEdit I put the select and delete in a procedure, and then called this procedure using a scheduled event that fires of in an interval that corresponds with the interval of the data input, and this works.

Positive 1694 pI have two SQL Server tables,p  ul lithe first one is populated by a web service li liand the second one is used by a software that our company uses for the customer registries. li ul  pRight now I have a stored procedure, scheduled in a SQL Server Agent job, which takes all new entries from the table 1, prepares them and inserts them into a table 2. p  pThis job runs once a day and works fine. But I need to do this more often. The web service is not used so often  but I need to do an insert in table 2 every time a person uses the web service. p  pFirst, I planned to schedule the existing job every 2 minutes, just to check if there are any new rows. But I am not sure if thats OK for performance of the server p  pThen I thought about SQL Server triggers which I havent use before. I wrote an after insert trigger to start the existing SQL Server job but, then the web service stopped working. The web service checks the unique email address. p  pIf I understood triggers right, the trigger will generate a new inserted table, so every time a user wants to register in the web service and the trigger is active, the user gets the error message the email address is already in use. p  pI cant change the structure of tables or the logic of the web service. I have to adapt the data from table 1 to fit into table 2 so I cant use replication either. p  pI would appreciate if you could give me some ideas, how to solve the problem with the trigger or if theres another solution I could usep  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1694 pa hrefhttpwiki.python.orgmoinPythonDecoratorLibrarySmartdeprecationwarnings.28withvalidfilenames.2Clinenumbers.2Cetc..29Ive seen decoratorsa that let you mark a function a deprecated so that a warning is given whenever that function is used.

However, I have drop privileges. I am really confused and I cant seem to find a solution that works for me.p  pThanks to you in advance.p  pSOLUTIONp  pAs Steve mentioned below, Oracle security model is weird in that it needs to know explicitly somewhere in the procedure what kind of privileges to use. The way to let Oracle know that is to use AUTHID keyword in the CREATE OR REPLACE statement. If you want the same level of privileges as the creator of the procedure, you use AUTHID DEFINER. If you want Oracle to use the privileges of the user currently running the stored procedure, you want to use AUTHID CURRENTUSER. The procedure declaration looks as followsp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE uspdropTableschema VARCHAR, tblToDrop VARCHAR  AUTHID CURRENTUSER IS BEGIN   DECLARE vcnt NUMBER   BEGIN     SELECT COUNT        INTO vcnt        FROM alltables       WHERE owner  schema        AND tablename  tblToDrop       IF vcnt gt 0 THEN          EXECUTE IMMEDIATEDROP TABLE someschema.sometable PURGE      END IF    END END codepre  pThank you everyone for responding.

If Element inherits Width then it is forced to implement the getWidth and setWidth methods. So adding an attribute implies an automatic update of Elements interface.li liI originally named these classes AttributeController, WidthController and HeightController, but I found them too verbose. You could say that my Element is an Attribute controller. Ok, thats lame, but not untrueli liFurther proof the definitions of Width and Height do not contain any data members. The Element class actually emhasem them. The Width and Height classes only provide the interfaces. So its more of a emcandoem relationship.li ul

Negative 1694 pHi  I have a pretty straight forward data binding question from the side of writing data bindable controls that has me confused.p  pLooking at the .NET source code, it seems that most data binding is abstracted via the DataBinder.GetPropertyValue method.  This method takes an object and a property name, and the method will find the value via a TypeDescriptor or reflection or whatever.  This works great on an IListSource such as DataSet, however I cant get it working with an XmlNode object.  I know that you can bind an XmlNodeList to a data source in ASP.NET, so I would expect this to work.  Heres the codep  precodeclass Program     static void Mainstring[] args           XmlDocument doc  new XmlDocument       doc.LoadData.xml       IEnumerable list  doc.SelectNodesDataRow        foreach object item in list                 object val  DataBinder.GetPropertyValueitem, Number Expect to see 1, 2 and 3             codepre  pAnd Data.xml isp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt ltDatagt    ltRow Number1 gt    ltRow Number2 gt    ltRow Number3 gt ltDatagt codepre  pWhen I call GetPropertyValue, I get this exceptionp  pDataBinding System.Xml.XmlElement does not contain a property with the name Number.p  pIn my Data Binding loop, I just want to loop through any IEnumerable  I dont want to special case the XmlNode type.  Controls such as DropdownList will special case IListSource and do some conversions, however other IEnumerables look like theyre treated as is.  Thanksp
Negative 1694 pI have actually two questions but they are kind of related so here they go as one...p  pHow to ensure garbage collection of tree nodes that are not currently displayed using TreeViewerSWT.VIRTUAL and ILazeTreeContentProvider If a node has 5000 children, once they are displayed by the viewer they are never let go, hence Out of Memory Error if your tree has great number of nodes and leafs and not big enough heap size. Is there some kind of a best practice how to avoid memory leakages, caused by never closed view holding a treeviewer with great amounts of data hundreds of thousands objects or even millions Perhaps maybe there is some callback interface which allow greater flexibility with viewercontent provider elementsp  pIs it possible to combine deffered DeferredTreeContentManager AND lazy ILazyTreeContentProvider loading for a single TreeViewerSWT.VIRTUAL As much as I understand by looking at examples and APIs, it is only possible to use either one at a given time but not both in conjunction ,e.g. , fetch ONLY the visible children for a given node AND fetch them in a separate thread using Job API. What bothers me is that Deferred approach loads ALL children. Although in a different thread, you It still load all elements even though only a minimal subset are displayed at once.p  pI can provide code examples to my questions if required...p  pI am currently struggling with those myself so If I manage to come up with something in the meantime I will gladly share it here.p  pThanksp  pRegards, Svilenp

Negative 1694 pThe ContentProvider doc says to make ONE entry in the AndroidManifest for your ContentProvider class. If your class supports multiple subtables then there must be one CONTENTURI constant declared for each. How You cant do that unless you subclass for each subtable. Why not just have multiple providersp  pDo you implement the subtable providers as descendants With multiple subtables, there is still only ONE ContentProvider class p  pAs you can see, Im confused by the documentation. It readsp  blockquote   pDefine a public static final Uri named   CONTENTURI. This is the string that   represents the full content URI that   your content provider handles. You   must define a unique string for this   value. The best solution is to use the   fullyqualified class name of the   content provider made lowercase. So,   for example, the URI for a   TransportationProvider class could be   defined as followsp blockquote  precodepublic static final Uri CONTENTURI                  Uri.parsecontentcom.example.codelab.transporationprovider codepre  pIf the provider has subtables, also define CONTENTURI constants for each of the subtables.

Negative 1694 pIm working on a project where we use Hibernate and JBoss 5.1. We need our entity classes to be mapped to Oracle tables that follow a certain naming convention. Id like to avoid having to specify each table and column name in annotations. Therefore, Im currently considering implementing a custom implementation of codeorg.hibernate.cfg.NamingStrategycode.p  pThe SQL naming conventions require the name of columns to have a suffix that is equivalent to a prefix of the table name. If there is a table T100RESOURCE, the ID column would have to be named RESIDT100.p  pIn order to implement this in a codeNamingStrategycode, the implementation would have to maintain state, i.e. the current class name it is creating the mappings for. It would rely on Hibernatep  ul lito always call codeclassToTableNamecode before codepropertyToColumnNamecodeli liand to determine all column names by calling  codepropertyToColumnNamecode before the next call to codeclassToTableNamecodeli ul  pIs it safe to do that or are there situations where Hibernate will mix things up I am not thinking of problems through multiple threads here which can be solved by keeping the last class name in a codeThreadLocalcode but also of Hibernate deliberately calling this out of order in certain circumstances. For example Hibernate asking for mappings of three properties of class A, then one of class B, then again more attributes of class A.p

Clearly the assignees are on the task object and not on the workflow object.  I added the assignees aspect to the startstate task so that it could hold them after I had a problem initially they were not there and possibly they are still sitting there, but the startstate has ended before I even get control back from the web script not that it would help if it wasnt ended, I need it to be in In Editing as the startstate is only used to log that the workflow was started.  p  ppIt has always confused me that the properties that I need to set on each task need to be requested before the task is entered when you choose a transition you must provide the data for the next task before you can actually move to the next task as you have to validate that you have all of the required data emfirstem and then signal the transition.  However, the code to start the workflow is asynchronous and therefore does not return either the started workflow or the current task which in my case would be In Editing.  So, either way you cannot set variables such as bpmassignees and bpmdueDate.  p  ppI wonder if this is the problem with the user task list.  Im setting the assignees in the property list, but maybe those assignees are going to the startstate task and are not getting passed to the In Editing taskp  ppNote that this emisem my first jBPM workflow, so please dont assume I know what Im doing.  If you see something that looks off, it probably is and I just dont know it.p  ppThanks in advance for any advice or help,p

Negative 1694 pAt the moment I have some PHP which sets a single variable based on the value of other independent variables in a linear format, like sop  precoderesult  0  if var1  X    result  10   if var2 lt 10    result  15  elseif var2 gt 50    result  50    more of the same codepre  pHowever, Id like to be able to express these rules in a less programminglike way, mainly so that someone who doesnt know how to program can addedit rules, and also because I might want to use the same rules in a Python or Perl script, without having to maintain copies in multiple languages.

Negative 1694 pI have an application using Fluent NHibernate on the server side to configure the database. Fluent uses Lazyloading as default, but I explicitly disabled this as this gave me problems when sending the objects to the client side. Obviously the client cant load the objects lazily as it doesnt have access to the database. p  pNow I try reenabling Lazyloading for parts of my datamodel as there are some parts where I only want to return toplevel objects to the client. However, they dont seem to be Lazyloaded. Why p  pWhat I did to disable LazyLoading was adding codeNot.LazyLoadingcode in the mapping object, and on references in the mapping. Now removing this doesnt seem to have effect. Debugging I see all the referenced objects, and I also get them all on the client side. However, the codeNHibernateUtil.IsInitializedmyObjectFromDb.SomeReferencecode correctly says false at the same time. So how do I ensure that the objects are lazyloaded getting a object missing its references back to the client Any ideas what I might got wrong p  pI have a few classes very simplified example.. p  precodepublic class Customer      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual string Name  get set      public virtual IListltOrdergt Orders  get set    public class Order      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual IListltItemgt Items  get set    public class Item      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual string Name  get set   codepre  pSimple mappings  using default LazyLoading p  precodepublic class CustomerMapping  ClassMapltCustomergt      public CustomerMapping              Idc gt c.Id         Mapc gt c.Name         HasManyc gt c.Orders        public class OrderMapping  ClassMapltOrdergt      public OrderMapping              Idc gt c.Id         HasManyc gt c.Items        public class ItemMapping  ClassMapltItemgt      public ItemMapping              Idc gt c.Id         Mapc gt c.Name       codepre  pAnd I fetch it straight forward with a codeSession.LoadltCustomergtidcode  returning the result over my REST service directly without accessing the object such that the lazy references are loaded. Both right after the Load and on the object returned to the server side the references are loaded. How can I prevent this p

Negative 1694 pI want to know if it is possible to use the same index file for an entity in two applications. Let me be more specificp  pWe have an online Application with a frondend for the users and an application for the backend tasks  administrator interface. Both are running on the same JBOSS AS. Both Applications are using the same database, so they are using the same entities. Of course the package names are not the same in both applications for the entities.p  pSo this is our usecase A user should be able to search via the frondend. The user is only allowed to see results which are tagged with visible. This tagging happens in our admin interface, so the index for the frontend should be updated every time an entity is tagged as visible in the backend.p  pOf course both applications do have the same index root folder. In my index folder there are 2 index files p  pde.x.x.admin.model.Product de.x.x.frondend.model.Productp  pHow to merge this via Hibernate Search Configuration I just did not get it via the documentation...p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 1694 pIm reading a book on WCF and author debates about pros of using messagelevel security over using transportlevel security.

In other words, if a message   must travel through an intermediary   before reaching its destination, there   is no way to ensure that transport   security has been enabled for the step   after the intermediary unless that   interme diary is fully controlled by   the original service provider. If   that security is not faithfully   reproduced, the data may be   compromised downstream. p      pstrongMessage securitystrong focuses on ensuring the integrity and privacy of   individ ual messages, without regard   for the network. Through mechanisms   such as encryption and signing via   public and private keys, the message   will be protected even if sent over an   unprotected transport such as plain   HTTP.p blockquote  pa p  blockquote   pIf that security is not faithfully   reproduced, the data may be   compromised downstream.p blockquote  pTrue, but assuming two systems communicating use SSL and thus certificates, then the data they exchange cant be decrypted by intermediary, but instead it can only be altered, which the receiver will notice and thus reject the packetp  pb Anyways, as far as I understand the above quote, it is implying that if two systems establish a SSL connection, and if intermediary system codeScode has SSL enabled and if codeScode is also owned by a hacker, then codeScode  aka hacker  wont be able to intercept SSL traffic travelling through it But if codeScode doesnt have SSL enabled, then hacker will be able to intercept SSL traffic That doesnt make sensep  pcp  blockquote   pMessage security focuses on ensuring the integrity and privacy of individ   ual messages, without regard for the network.

Negative 1694 pI am an experienced Visual Studio developer who has recently taken on an OSX 10.6 project a C server project with no UI.p  pI have been successfully debugging the application using the XCode debugger setting breakpoints, etc. for months, including debugging the source code for various static libraries that are linked into the final executable program.p  pHowever, tonight I was required to debug with breakpoints a DYLIB that is also built from our source code, but that is linked dynamically at runtime with the application the name of the DYLIB is read from an .ini file by the main application.p  pUnfortunately, the usual method I use of debugging the application rightclicking the custom executable and selecting Debug with Breakpoints, though it does successfully run the debugger and allow me to debug the application along with its statically linked libraries, exhibits the following undesired behavior when I attempt to hit a breakpoint in the source code for the DYLIBp  p The XCode debugger reports that the breakpoint was hit in the sense that I see the function and line number in the status bar at the bottom of the XCode windows along with an indication that this is a gdb message, and the application halts execution.  However, there is no stack trace, no variables, nothing  just a completely empty debugger window.  The buttons to to step over, step into, etc, are disabled.  No editor window appears in the debugger and hence no visual indication that the debugger has stopped on the line indicated.  Opening the file by hand does not reveal the debugger hitting the line.p  pUnfortunately, this is useless for me as far as my attempts to debug the DYLIB.p  pI have hunted far and wide tonight researching and attempting to find a way for the XCode debugger to successfully hit breakpoints in a meaningful way in the source code for this dynamically linked DYLIB.  I have of course done a number of cleanrebuilds.  I have made certain that load symbols lazily is unchecked and then cleanedrebuilt.  I have restarted, and I have also deleted the build directory and rebuilt.  I also deleted the userspecific files in the .xcodeproj package.  Note also that I am of course building and running all code, including the DYLIB code, in Development mode with all optimizations off, and generating debug symbols for all.  However, my attempts have been unsuccessful.  Nor can I find so much as a single mention of this problem on internet forums.p  pAny help in instructing me how to use XCode to successfully debug a DYLIB that is linked to my application would be appreciated.p  pThanks, Dan.p

Negative 1694 pI have an EJB, and a web service using it. I would now like to write a simple TCP server as an alternative to the webservice, but I dont want to rewrite the logic in the EJB and the database layer beneath it. p  pSo I wrote a simple TCP server as a singleton and annotated it Startup. The application works but it also seems to kill the JBoss administration console aswell as produce a slew of timeout exceptions. I suspect the cause is the infinite while loop I have in the server bean, which is required to accept incoming connections. Is there a way around this or is simply a bad idea to have an EJB as the serverp  pI guess the alternative is to write a standalone java app and use a remote interface on my business logic EJB, though it seems a bit of a hassle....p

Negative 1694 pI tried to run a sample Preon application on Android 2.1 without luck. I wonder if running a Preon application on Android is even possible.

Think JAXB or Hibernate, but then for binary encoded data written by Wilfred Springer.p  hr  pBelow are my finding when trying to run a simple application that uses Preon in Androidp  pPreon has a dependency on Pecia.

Negative 1694 pI have looked around SO and the web for quite some time now and I am struggling to find any information for how to setup my C project for unit tests.p  pI started on the NUnit main site a hrefhttpwww.nunit.orghttpwww.nunit.orga, the download includes a GUI to run your unit tests, sounds mint.  Only when I try and point the GUI to my .exe, I get an error immediately saying that NUnit is not designed to be run with this framework.  That got me thinking that maybe NUnit doesnt work with .net 4.  Apparently it does, plenty of people online seem to state that they are running NUnit unit tests with .net 4 .... of course they dont seem to go on to say how.p  pClicking around google I found what appears to be one of the core members of the NUnit development is a dude called Charlie Poole.  I found he had a launchpad here a hrefhttpslaunchpad.netnunitxtphttpslaunchpad.netnunitxtpa.  The version numbers are newer than on the main NUnit site.  When I downloaded the project however, it is just the codebase and solution for the NUnit framework with no GUI.  There is a command line runner included but I really need something visual.p  pWe do have jetbrains teamcity as a BMS so I am now going down the path of maybe trying to integrate NUnit into the build pipeline somehow.  If anyone can shed any light on how they got NUnit working with an express edition of c that would be wonderfully helpful.p  pEdit  I have the teamcity BMS running the tests now, so that part is no longer a problem.  However, waiting for the build each time just to find a NullException error or something doesnt really cut it.  I have to get the GUI runner working.  I found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions930438nunitisntrunningvisualstudio2010codeNUnit isn39t running Visual Studio 2010 codea but even that isnt fixing it for me.

Negative 1694 pI know there are many posts out there about the differences between these two patterns, but there are a few things that I cannot find.p  pFrom what I have been reading, I see that the factory method pattern allows you to define how to create a single concrete product but hiding the implementation from the client as they will see a generic product. My first question is about the abstract factory. Is its role to allow you to create families of concrete objects in that can depend on what specific factory you use rather than just a single concrete object Does the abstract factory only return one very large object or many objects depending on what methods you callp  pMy final 2 questions are about a single quote that I cannot fully understand that I have seen in numerous placesp  p One difference between the two is thatp  blockquote   pwith the Abstract Factory pattern, a   class delegates the responsibility of   object instantiation to another object   via composition whereas the Factory   Method pattern uses inheritance and   relies on a subclass to handle the   desired object instantiation.p blockquote  pMy understanding is that the factory method pattern has a Creator interface that will make the ConcreteCreator be in charge of knowing which ConcreteProduct to instantiate. Is this what it means by using inheritance to handle object instantiationp  pNow with regards to that quote, how exactly does the Abstract Factory pattern delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to another object via composition What does this mean It looks like the Abstract Factory pattern also uses inheritance to do the construction process as well in my eyes, but then again I am still learning about these patterns.p  pAny help especially with the last question of mine would be greatly appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 1694 pI hoping someone will be able to help me, as Im at a loss as to what is causing the problem. Our website has a contact us form, with fields for name, email, kid name, kid ID, amp message.p  pWhen the form submits, the server side php code validates the form fields, amp if all is good, uses the built in php mail function to send 2 emails.p  pEmail 1 goes to an inbox on a hosted exchange server containing the values in the form fields.p  pEmail 2 goes to the person submitting the form saying thanks  well get back to you shortly.p  pFor email 1, the From, ReplyTo, amp ReturnPath headers are set to the email entered in the form, amp the To param in the mail function is the email address of the inbox of the hosted exchange server.p  pFor email 2, the From, ReplyTo, amp ReturnPath headers are set to the email address of the inbox on the hosted exchange server, amp the To param in the mail function is the email address entered in the form.p  pThe websites host has the MX, PTR, SPF, amp TXT records set up properly to allow emails to be sent to amp from the email address of the inbox of the hosted exchange server. The websites host uses QMail as the SMTP service that actually sends the emails, amp in all tests, QMail is receiving a success when sending both email 1 amp 2.  There is no error issued by the mail function.p  pLocal tests were done with IE8, Chrome, amp FF3.6.17.  The code was not changed between tests showing this problem.p  pIn all test cases, email 2 back to the person submitting the form is sent just fine. Email 1, on the other hand, is only intermittently working.  The general pattern is that the 1st time the contact form is used with each distinct email address in the form, the email is sent fine, amp the headers amp to are correct.p  pThe 2nd time the contact form is used with a previously used email address in the form, the To param is set to the email address in the form, the headers are all blank, amp in spite of the To email address being incorrect, the email p  pis not received. The websites hosts support staff may have found another potential symptom, which is that after clearing cookies, all the email 2s got through ok.  However, the page does not use any cookies in relation to the form. Lastly, I tried again a while 30 mins after email 2s werent getting through, then another try worked, after which the email 2s screwed up as described above again.p  pIs there a known bug with phps mail function along these lines  Is there a maximum frequency at which mail can be used Im at a loss as to why the code sometimes works, amp sometimes doesnt.  The websites hosts staff are at a loss, as well. Trying to google this issue seems to turn up forums of people saying to use different modules Swift Mailer, PHPMailer, Pear Mail, etc., but as the website is live, Im wary that rebuilding the automated emailing code will p  pintroduce errors beyond the one described above.p  p... edited 6jun11 ...p  psorry, didnt know I could edit my post...p  pHeres the most pertinent codep  precodefunction UserToSiteEmail name, fromEmail, message, kidID, kidName       subject  Face of Kinder  contact us     headers  GetEmailHeadersfromEmail     imageFilename  constantURLROOT.kidimages.kidgtImageFilename     profileUrl  constantURLROOT.profile.phpk.kidgtKidID     body  filegetcontentsEmailTemplatesContactUs.html     body  strreplaceFromName,name,body     body  strreplaceFromEmail,fromEmail,body     body  strreplaceKidName,kidName,body     body  strreplaceKidID,kidID,body     body  strreplaceMessage,message,body     body  strreplaceSiteRoot,constantURLROOT,body     return mailconstantFROMEMAIL,subject,body,headers   function GetEmailHeaders fromEmail       headers  From Face of Kinder lt . fromEmail . gt .

This is even though the same code correctly put the forms email into the header, amp the email inboxs address in the To field on the 1st submitting of the form per browser.p  pI can add the HTML side of the form if needed, but in terms of its process, after the form is submitted back to itself, after validating amp emailing, the php redirects to a thanks page.  Im not certain how GET amp POST variables would persist after the thank you page, as the only way back to the page is to click the link for the contact form again.

Negative 1694 pAssume a table that may look like thisp  precodeuserId INT foreign key to a users table profileId INT foreign key to a profiles table value INT codepre  pSay that in this table preferences for users are saved. The preference should be loaded according to the current user and the profile that the current user has selected. That means that the combination of codeuserIdcode and codeprofileIdcode is unique and can be used as a composite primary key.p  pBut then I want to add the ability to also save a default value that should be used if no value for a specific codeprofileIdcode is save in the database. My first idea would be to set the codeprofileIdcode column to nullable and say that the row that has null as codeprofileIdcode contains the default value. But then I cant use a composite primary key that involves this table, because a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions386040whatswrongwithnullablecolumnsincompositeprimarykeysnullable columns cant be part of a primary keya.p  pSo whats the best way to work around this Just drop the primary key completely and go without primary key Generate an identity column as primary key that I never need Create a dummy profile to link to in the profile table Create a separate table for default values which is the only option that guarantees that no codeuserIdcode has multiple default valuesp  pUpdate I thought about Dmitrys answer but after all it has the drawback that I cant even create a unique constraint on the two columns userId and profileId MySQL will allow duplicate values if profileId is null and DB2 will refuse to even create a unique constraint on a nullable column. So with Dmitrys solution I will have to live without this consistency check of the DB. Is that acceptable Or is that not acceptable after all consistency checks are a major feature of relational DBs.

Negative 1694 pI have been learning managed pointers lately and ran into the following scenario.p  pI am implementing a modelcontroller class for a game view. My view, will render things in the model. Pretty straight forward. In my main function, I instantiate all three like thisp  precodeRenderModel m m.AddItemrect  rect gets added just fine, its an entity derivee RenderView v v.SetModelm codepre  pMy render view class is pretty straightforwardp  precodeclass RenderView  public explicit RenderView RenderView  void Update  void SetModelRenderModelamp model  private  disable RenderViewconst RenderViewamp other RenderViewamp operatorconst RenderViewamp other   private members boostscopedptrltRenderModelgt model  codepre  pThe implementation for setView is pretty standardp  precodevoid RenderViewSetModelRenderModelamp model      model.resetampmodel  codepre  pThe key to this is, the view stores a model in a smart pointer. However in main, the model was allocated on the stack. When the program exits, the memory gets deleted twice. This makes sense. My current understanding tells me that anything which gets stored in a smartptr of any kind should not have been allocated on the stack. p  pAfter all the above setup, my question is simple how do I dictate that a parameter was not allocated on the stack Is accepting a smart pointer as a parameter the only solution Even then I could not ensure that someone using my view class could not do something incorrect such asp  precode If I implemented SetModel this way void RenderViewSetModelconst stdsharedptrltRenderModelgtamp model      model.resetampmodel   RenderModel m RenderView v stdsharedptrltRenderModelgt ptrampm  create a sharedptr from a stackobject. v.SetModelptr codepre

Negative 1694 pstrongProblem A Service called PdService is not found during execution when I send an Intent to bind it from an Activity.strongp  pstrong[Edit Solution]strongp  pI am not crystal clear on the issues surrounding the solution, however a solution has been found.  When I export the JAR of my main project which is linked to an Android library project, I choose the option to include the library project in the JAR as well.  This fixed the problem.  p  pNow, its strange because the source code from the linked project was clearly making it into the JAR even before this, it just was not being found by the Android runtime.  But for some reason explicitly including the entire linked project has fixed this issue.  Its also an unfortunate workaround because I now have to include far more content in my JAR than I want to, but for now the problem is resolved.p  pstrong[Original Problem Details]strongp  pstrongDetailsstrongp  ul liThe app is an strongAIR for Androidstrong app .SWF  OTHERSTUFF  .APKli liThe java code including PdService has been packaged in an strongAIR Native Extensionstrong .aneli liThe Intent for PdService occurs within our custom strongFREContextstrong see AIR Native Extensions which we have called PdContext, specifically in a method called init.li liFor completeness, I have included the  tag for PdService in both the extensions Android manifest, as well as the AIR applications application.xml file.li liThe package name of the extension is strongcom.nichemobile.pd.pdextensionstrongli liThe class path of PdService is strongorg.puredata.android.service.PdServicestrongli liThe ID of the enduser application AIR ID is strongcom.nichemobile.pdextension.testappstrongli ul  pI have tried a number of combinations of Intents including thisActivity is a reference to the executing Activityp  precodebindIntent.setClassNamethisActivity, org.puredata.android.service.PDService bindIntent.setClassNamethisActivity, .org.puredata.android.service.PDService bindIntent.setClassNamethisActivity, ..org.puredata.android.service.PDService bindIntent.setClassNameorg.puredata.android.service, .org.puredata.android.service.PDService bindIntent.setClassNameorg.puredata.android.service, org.puredata.android.service.PDService bindIntent.setClassName, org.puredata.android.service.PDService bindIntent.setClassName., org.puredata.android.service.PDService codepre  pEach Intent results in a runtime error claiming the service is not found.

These groups should be stored in a way that given any member of the group, you can fetch other members of the group with high efficiency. p  pSo given this initial set code[a,b1,b2,c1,c2,c3]code the result structure should be something like code[a,[b1,b2],[c1,c2,c3]]code and Fetchb should return code[b1,b2]code.p  pIs there a specific data structure andor algorithm for this purposep  pEDIT b1 and b2 are not actual strings, theyre indicating that the 2 belong to the same group. Otherwise a Trie would be a perfect fit.p

Negative 1694 pI am wondering what is the best way, given a TreeSet of Date objects, to tell if these dates are daily or monthly. Note the set of daily dates will not have dates for weekends or bank holidays. The set of monthly dates will have monthend dates. The set of dates will span a few years. p  pThe only way I can presently think of is to take the first 12 dates from the set and inspect each dates month. If a month is found more than once in succession then this is likely to be a set of daily dates. If not then it can be assumed that its a set of monthly dates.p  pWhilst this seems like it should work I cant think of any edgecases that it would miss I was wondering if there were a more elegant solution I would imagine some sort of data structure a tree that uses a comparator based on month and year. Then if a subtree of this collection contained more than one node then I could assume they were daily dates. Im not sure if this way would warrant the extra code or if theres a better solution available. Thanks for any help you can give me.p

Negative 1694 pI have an application where I have a main viewmodel whose view contains a tabcontrol, where each tab has its own view and viewmodel and possibly more of them. I believe this is a pretty common design. Now, I want to open new tabs by instantiating new viewmodels and adding them to the collection of workspaces by firing commands from controls inside those tabs. The problem is that the command is received by the inner viewmodel, that controls the tab, not the outer one that controls the tabcontrol. What would be the best practice to do this All the solutions I can think of are kind of hacky giving the viewmodel a reference to its parent viewmodel, subscribing to a childs event from the parent.... I am assuming there is a nice solution for this.p  pFor example, from a list of entities view, clicking the new button or selecting a row should open another tab with an entity details type of view. However, the command will be received by the list of entities views viewmodel, to whom the tab is bound, and not the list of workspaces viewmodel to whom the tabcontrol is bound.p

Ive read somewhere that python reportlab can make styled tables with alignments and so on, so that could be a good start, but reportlab generates PDF. Of course, if that is just a step between it is also acceptable if I could do the PDF  img conversion on my machine.

Negative 1694 pI know that virtually anything is possible with CSS, but Im a bit stumped on how to achieve this layout model.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2uqcS.gif altmodel of my desired layoutp  pIll let the image do most of the talking. Two columns, both fixed width and centered in the browser to begin with. Im stumped as to how to make the main column expand fluidly as screen size allows.  I can give the main column a minwidth as the baseline, but how can it expand fluidly to fill the remaining right hand portion of the browser viewport  Allthewhile the layout should stay centered.p  pIm the type who likes to experiment until I figure something out, but Im not sure where to even begin here. Would negative margins, maxwidth  values, minwidth px values, and overflowhidden be a place to beginp  pI guess what Im asking is, has anyone achieved this layout in the past  Is there a way to achieve it that doesnt seem too ducttaped together  Hopefully Im missing something obviousp  pAny help, tips, or relevant links are greatly appreciated Thanksp

I am not trying to get other people to do my work for me, however for a rookie it is pretty much impossible to crack what a particular tool is supposed to do, where it starts and where another ends. Especially because of the functional overlap between the tools. I am not located in Silicon Valley encircled by sages who could initiate me into the secrets and the publicly available documentation is of no use.p  pstrongFinal Editstrong Although I wasnt really thinking about replacing virtualenv with Buildout when starting this question. But while doing my research I realized something I always knew, but just didnt come to me in total clarity. There are many ways about Python packaging and deployment automation. There are also many tools which can help you get the stuff done. However while there is significant functional overlap between the tools, the toolchain is ever evolving and thus far there is no clear standard best practice. The distribution toolchain arms race is still in full heat and no clear victor has emerged yet. This may be confusing to us noobs, who expect that most of shit in Python just works. What I was after distutilssetuptools  pip  virtualenv in a Buildout fashion or even semi integrated with Buildout certainly is dooable, but it just doesnt make much sense, not because its not possible  but because nobody does it. If you need this level of sophistication, then you need to commit. Personally I have decided to leave virtualenv behind for this project and embrace Buildout.p

Negative 1694 pIve searched on this for a while but none seem to be quite relevant enough.p  pBasically, I have a csv file that is extracted from a program. I wrote a quick python program to convert the csv file to an sql file so I can import it into the database. I then import the .sql file using the windows command prompt to my remote MySQL server. p  pI have some pound signs  in some of the fields in my database. In the csv file, they are showing as , in the resulting sql file after conversion they are showing as  because of my use of re.escape  Im actually thinking this may be the reason The python code that writes this to the file is  for row in csvReader     ...other stuff...     sqlfile.writere.escaperow[6].p  pAfter the file is imported, I view the tables and the pound signs are now showing as  in the tables, and when the contents is shown on the website using php to query. The database Server connection collation is utf8generalci and Im connecting to the remote server with thiscommand mysql hostHOST userUSER passwordPASS defaultcharactersetutf8 DATABASENAME lt filetoimport.sqlp  pChanging the character encoding on firefox made no difference, as expected  whatever is happening seems to be when the sql dump is imported.p  pBeing honest, Im not really completely sure I understand how the whole character set things work, Ive never really had to try and fix a problem like this before so Im not really sure what else to try. Any help or even a point in the right direction to search, as my searches so far doesnt seem to be helping me p  pThank youp

Negative 1694 pIm working on an old website that used to be hosted on an Apple server. When it was migrated into a new Linux server it stopped working. Im pretty sure its because all the MySQL queries used in the php scripts have different case combinations for the table names I dont know why the original developers didnt follow any conventions when they created the table names or the php scripts and it didnt matter because both Mac and Windows MySQL servers are case insensitive by default when it comes to this. However, Linux is not.p  pIs there a way to change the Linux default on MySQL so it becomes case insensitive and it works like Mac or Windows Ive been looking but havent found any answers that dont involve changing either the scripts or the table names or both. The website must have been generated using some CMS so there are dozens upon dozens of pages and include files with multiple queries in each and hundreds of tables. I began trying to implement this type of solution in the smartest way I could think of but if I touch the table names then other currently working pages stop working Im trying to avoid breaking the site further.p  pThere was a system variable lowercasetablenames in the MySQL Server console in Webmin in the Linux server that I read could be changed from 0 to 1 to tackle this issue, but Webmin wont let me change it because its a readonly variable.p  pYoud think this would be an easily problem to solve, but so far Im losing hope. Im hoping someones got an answer that maybe eludes me at the moment.p

Negative 1694 pIm trying to create a central event dispatching system using kind of an Observer pattern for my small RPG project, and I need advice on how best to represent event data. p  pIll have an EventManager that registers listener classes for different event types defined in a static enum such as EventInputKeyPressed or EventGameActorMoved. It will store events in a queue and dispatch them to the corresponding listeners, which will each have a method handleEventEvent e or something. p  pEach event will be an object of type Event, which holds data such as its event type.p  pMy question is, since the nature of the event data differs considerably between event types, how should this data be represented Im not yet sure exactly what types of events I will want to create in the future, so I want this to be as flexible as possible. For example, an event could trigger other events if certain conditions are true ie. when the player pressed the action key, a door opens if the player is in a certain location and has a key. Is XML or scripts a good choice Another way I can think of is to create a custom class for every general event, like ActorEvent or MenuEvent, but that seems really inefficient and inflexible. Also, since some objects such as Character only need to know very specific events like when the w key is pressed, I figure they dont need to be notified when other keys like h are pressed. Is it viable to create event types that specific or is there a better way ie. EventInputKeyPressedWp  pThanksp

Negative 1694 pI have 2D hydraulic data, which are multigigabyte text files containing depth and velocity information for each point in a grid, broken up into time steps. Each timestep contains a depthvelocity value for every point in the grid. So you could follow one point through each timestep and see how its depthvelocity changes. I want to read in this data one timestep at a time, calculating various things  the maximum depth a grid cell achieves, max velocity, the number of the first timestep where water is more than 2 feet deep, etc. The results of each of these calculations will be a grid  max depth at each point, etc.p  pSo far, this sounds like the Decorator pattern. However, Im not sure how to get the results out of the various calculations  each calculation produces a different grid. I would have to keep references to each decorator after I create it in order to extract the results from it, or else add a codegetResultscode method that returns a map of different results, etc, neither of which sound ideal.p  pAnother option is the Strategy pattern. Each calculation is a different algorithm that operates on a time step current depthvelocity and the results of previous rounds max depth so far, max velocity so far, etc. However, these previous results are different for each computation  which means either the algorithm classes become stateful, or it becomes the callers job to keep track of previous results and feed them in. I also dislike the Strategy pattern because the behavior of looping over the timesteps becomes the callers responsibility  Id like to just give the calculator an iterator over the timesteps fetching them from the disk as needed and have it produce the results it needs.p  pAdditional constraintsp  ul liInput is large and being read from disk, so iterating exactly once, by time step, is the only practical methodli liGrids are large, so calculations should be done in place as much as possibleli ul

The result was that the SQL was a bit jumbled up to the point it contained syntax errors in comparison to when using a standard foreach loop, therefore my gut feeling is that TPL is not suited to performing tasks where the data must appear in a particular order.p  pstrongQuestion 2.strongp  pemDoes the TPL automatically make use of multicore architectures of must I provision anything prior to executionemp  pMy reason for asking this relates back to an eariler question I asked relating to performance profiling of TPL operations. An answer to the question enlightened me to the fact that TPL is not always more efficient than a standard serial loop as the application may not have access to multiple cores, and therefore the overhead of creating additional threads and loops would create a performance decrease in comparison to a standard serial loop.p

Negative 1694 pI have a situation where I am loading many tab pages, but the tab pages need to have a collection of controls on them when theyre loaded.p  pThe way I worked around this was to create a new control  CustomTab  UserControl. This gave me access to the designer, but in order to configure a tab I still had to drag out a TabControl. So with the tab control out, I configure a single tab with all the controls I need along with a lot of user control and database logic. Then I include a method that returns the TabPage control.p  pSo in my main application, I have a normal TabControl set up on the form. Anytime I need a new tab, in the code I first make an instance of my CustomTab, then add the tab to the forms TabControl via my CustomTabs return method.p  pHow bad of a  design is this It seems a little strange having an entire TabControl to just host the tab even though the control is never used, but it just makes designing new tabs such a breeze have a template user control set up I just copy and start designing the tab.p  pAm I wasting any significant amount of resources And is there a more efficient way this could be done that would still allow me to design the tabsp  pBest Regards, John W.p

Negative 1694 pIm trying to integrate a RequireJS setup on my frontend generated  administered by Yeoman, with the Laravel PHP framework on the backend. Everything is golden except the concatenation part of the build step in Yeoman  r.js for my javascript files.p  pMy problem in a nutshell the r.js build step in Yeoman looks for an index.html file with the HTML comments like codelt buildjs scriptsamdapp.js gtcode around the RequireJS script tag, which kicks off the optimisation and concatenation routine in the RequireJS optimiser. However Im using the Laravel framework, so there is no index.html, since it is generated dynamically.p  pIve managed to make the process work by doing an ugly hack and adding in an index.html in the app directory file, that just has p  precodelt buildjs scriptsamdapp.js gt ltscript datamainscriptsmain srcscriptsvendorrequire.jsgtltscriptgt lt endbuild gt codepre  pWhich lets Yeoman  r.js find an index.html file with the appropriate tags and filepath, do all its awesome concatenation of my AMD modules and output it into a dist directory.p  pOnly this is a horrible hack, and Im sure there is a much simpler of achieving the same end. I assume it has to do with editing the Gruntfile containing the Yeoman build settings to reflect the info above. Im just not sure how p  pAnyone with some experience integrating Yeoman  RequireJS setup, with a backend framework might help I imagine this question applies equally to rails as well.p

Negative 1694 pIn my process i have created 10 threads and will use those threads till my application is alive. Each thread will perform some file input and output operation every time. So the problem is every time thread start executing then my process virtual memory is getting increased.  My analysis is that when one file input output task is allowcated to the thread then the file will be loaded to thread address space when thread start to copy the file and after copy is completed then the thread address space will not be cleared as still the thread is not exited. So if i once again assign another task to the thread then the new file will be loaded to the thread address space.p  pHence the main process virtual memory address space will be increase. SO Please correct me if i am wrong and also help to know this has some problem if the process run for log time.p

Negative 1694 pI have a page with several divisions.  The first 3 take up the entire width of the page from the top down 170px.

I could easily be searching in the wrong way though. p  pThis is homework.p
Negative 1694 pI Have two commands in my eclipse plugin. Upload and Run. They can be invoked by the user one after another. So it only makes sense to invoke Run after the upload command is done.p  pSince the upload command possibly takes some time it will schedule a WorkspaceJob for actual execution. And returns right after it scheduled the job.p  pWhat i like to do know is to add another command called Upload and Run which suprisingly is supposed to first upload and then run the selection. Therefore it must be notified when the codeWorkspaceJobcode started in the Upload command has finished.p  pSo id like to parameterize the command with an additional codeIJobChangeListenercode which it will add when the codeWorkspaceJobcode is scheduled.p  pUnfortunately it seems to me like its only possible to pass Strings as parameters to a command or Objects that can be converted to Strings easily. However a Listener like this cannot be passed as a String.p  ul liHow can i provide the command with such an Listener Objectli liIs there maybe an other way of providing the Listener Object to the Command other than passing it as a prameter that i didnt think ofli ul

Negative 1694 pI am looking at a piece of code where theres a cstyle cast that puzzles me.p  pI am fairly familiar with casting, but this one I really cant grasp. So, here it is I have two classes, say Base and Derived, but Derived does not add any methodattribute. Basically its just a particular case of Base when one of its attributes call it MblockSize is fixed to 1 however, none of the methods requires a particular implementation nor there is an extension of functionalities. The benefit of such Derived class is not the point of this thread. Lets assume the developers had their good reasons for this.p  pAnyway, in the piece of code Im looking something like this happensp  precodevoid fooconst Derivedamp d... [...] Base b fooDerivedamp b codepre  pSo, the developers casted the base object into a reference to a derived one. In my understanding, downcasting is done if the concrete type of the castee b is indeed Derived. Which is not the case here.p  pHowever, this is cstyle cast, so the compiler is trying a whole bunch of casts and I dont know which one it eventually works.p  pSo, questionsp  ul li1 what casting is the compiler doing Im assuming a reinterpretcast maybeli li2 would staticcastlt Derivedamp b work as wellli li3 if class Derived added some methodsattributes not used in foo, would this still workli li4 is the key point that foo does not use any functionality of Derived that is not already in Baseli ul  pI hope the question is clear.

Negative 1694 pIm working on an iOSapp where one of the features is scanning QRcodes. For this Im using the excellent library, ZBar. The scanning works fine and is generally really quick. However when you use smaller QRcodes it takes a bit longer to scan, mostly due to the fact that the autofocus needs some time to adjust. I was experimenting and noticed that the focus could be locked using the following codep  precodeAVCaptureDevice cameraDevice  readerView.device if [cameraDevice lockForConfigurationnil]       [cameraDevice setFocusModeAVCaptureFocusModeLocked]      [cameraDevice unlockForConfiguration]  codepre  pWhen this code is used after a successful scan, the coming scans are really quick. That made me wonder, could I somehow lock the focus before even scanning one code The app will only scan rather small QRcodes so there will never be a need for focusing on something far away. Sure, I could implement something like tap to focus, but preferably I would like to avoid that extra step. Is there a way to achieve this Or are there maybe another way of speeding things up when dealing with smaller QRcodesp  p Alexanderp

set in the call to codeRegisterOnEventBrokercode, where the code attempts to unregister any objects registered on the event broker. It fails because the event broker scope has been disposed, presumably because the parent service has been disposed. As far as I am aware, Ninject will only call OnDeactivation delegates for objects with lifetimes other than Transient scope, so why this doesnt work when the parent service is registered in codeRequestScopecode confuses me. Transient scope is not sufficient for the parent service because Im experiencing memory leaks because of this issue.p  pIm starting to wonder if this is a bug in the EventBroker extension.p

Negative 1694 pI am really struggling with an Eclipse project where Tomcat is giving me timeout.

Negative 1694 pI have an apache webserver which I have setup a website using flask using modwsgi. I am having a couple of issues which may or may not be related.p  ol lipWith every call to a certain page which runs a function performing heavy computation that takes over 2 seconds, the memory increases about 20 megabytes. My server starts out with about 350megabytes consumed by everything on the machine. The server has a total of 3,620megabytes shown in htop. After I reload this page many times, the total memory used by the server eventually starts topping out around 2,400 megabytes and stops increasing as much. After it gets to this level I havent been able to get it consume enough memory to go into swap after hundreds of page reloads. Is this by design of flask or apache or python To me, if there were some kind of caching mechanism, it didnt seem like memory accumulation would happen if the same URL is called every time. If I restart apache, the memory is released.pli lipSometimes calls to this page result in called functions erroring out, even though they are all read only calls not writing any data to the disk and the query string is the same for every page.pli lipI have another page calling another function which does much less computation, when called concurrently with other pages running on the web server, randomly errors out or the result an image comes back unexpectedly.pli ol  pCould issues 2 and 3 be related to issue 1 Could issues 2 and 3 be due to bad programming somehow or bad memory in the machine I am able to reproduce the randomness by loading the same URL in about 40 firefox tabs and then choosing the reload all tabs option.p  pWhat more information should be provided to get a better answerp  pI have tried placingp  precodeimport gc gc.collect codepre  pinto my code.p  pI do havep  precode    WSGIDaemonProcess website userwwwdata groupwwwdata processes2 threads2 homewebwebsite     WSGIScriptAlias  webwebsitewebsite.wsgi     ltDirectory webwebsitegt             WSGIProcessGroup website             WSGIScriptReloading On             WSGIApplicationGroup GLOBAL             Order deny,allow             Allow from all     ltDirectorygt codepre  pin my etcapache2sitesavailabledefault file. It doesnt seem like the memory should grow that much if there are only a total of 4 threads being created, should therep  pUPDATEp  pIf I set processes1 threads4, then the seemingly random issues occur all the time when two requests are placed at once. One I set processes4 threads1, then the seemingly random issues dont happen. The rise in memory is still occurring though, and actually will now rise all the way to the max RAM of the system and start swapping.p  pUPDATEp  pAlthough I havent gotten this runaway RAM consumption issue resolved, I didnt have problems for several months with my current application. Apparently it wasnt too popular, and after several days or so, apache may have been clearing out the RAM automatically or something.p  pNow, Ive made another application, which is fairly unrelated to the previous one. The previous application was generating about 1 megapixel images using matplotlib. My new application is generating 20 megapixel images and 1 megapixel images using matplotlib. The problem is monumentally larger now when 20 megapixel images are generated with the new application.

Below is a basic function that I made to eliminatereproduce the problem, interactively in ipython.p  precodedef BigComputation     import cStringIO     import matplotlib     matplotlib.useAgg     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      larger figure size causes more RAM to be used when savefig is run.     this function also uses some RAM that is never released automatically     if plt.closeall is never run, but it is a small amount,     so it is hard to tell unless run BigComputation thousands of times.     TheFigureplt.figurefigsize250,8      fileoutput  cStringIO.StringIO      causes lots of RAM to be used, and never released automatically     TheFigure.savefigfileoutput      releases all the RAM that is never released automatically     plt.closeall      return None codepre  pThe trick to getting rid of the RAM leak is to runp  precodeplt.closeall codepre  pwithin BigComputation, otherwise, BigComputation will just keep accumulating RAM every time the function is called. I dont know if I am just using matplotlib inappropriately or have bad coding technique, but I really would think that once BigComputation returns, it should release all the memory except any global objects or the objects it returned. It seems to me like matplotlib must be creating some global variables in an inappropriate way, because I have no idea what they are named.p  pI guess where my question stands now is why do I need plt.closeall I also need to try the suggestions of Graham Dumpleton in order to further diagnose my apache configuration to see why I need to set threads1 in apache to get the random errors to go away.p
Negative 1694 pThe interaction between Path and Paths seems simple enough. You get a Path object using Paths get method. You can then use Paths methodsp  precode    Path p  Paths.getCdirectoryfilename.txt     p.getFilename     p.getRoot     p.getParent     etc. codepre  pWhats confusing me is the fact that the Java documentation describes Path as being an interface. Normally speaking, an interface is just a collection of method signatures which you need to implement in any class which declares that it uses it via the implements keyword.p  pHowever, in the case of Path, theres no implements keyword used and you dont implement the methods. Theyre already predefined.p  pIve obviously got the wrong end of the stick somewhere. Can someone please explain what Ive misunderstoodp

I have a user control NavigationNenu with 4 user control NavigationItems on them, and essentially the NavigationItem is thisp  precodeltdiv classdivnavImagegt     ltaspImage IDnavImage runatserver ImageUrlltthis.DefaultImageUrl gt CssClassimagenavImage gt     ltdiv iddivIconText runatservergt   ltdivgt codepre  pwith this code behindp  precodePrivate ReadOnly Property NavImageElementId As String     Get         Return navImage.GetUniqueIDRelativeToMe.Parent.Parent.ToString.Replacec, c     End Get End Property  ltPersistenceModePersistenceMode.InnerPropertygt Public Property DefaultImageUrl As String  ltPersistenceModePersistenceMode.InnerPropertygt Public Property HoverImageUrl As String  ltPersistenceModePersistenceMode.InnerPropertygt Public Property IconText As String  Protected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load      navImage.Attributes.Addonmouseover, updateImageToHover  NavImageElementId       navImage.Attributes.Addonmouseout, updateImageToDefault  NavImageElementId       navImage.ImageUrl   amp DefaultImageUrl     divIconText.InnerText  IconText  End Sub codepre  pand the html for the nav menup  precodelt Control Languagevb AutoEventWireupfalse CodeBehindNavigationMenu.ascx.vb Inherits[internal stuff] gt lt Register SrcUserControlsCommonNavigationItem.ascx TagNamenavItem TagPrefixucNavItem gt  ltucNavItemnavItem IDhome DefaultImageUrlResourceshomedefault.png HoverImageUrlResourceshomehover.png IconTexthome runatserver gt ltucNavItemnavItem IDideas DefaultImageUrlResourcesideasdefault.png HoverImageUrlResourcesideashover.png IconTextideas runatserver gt ltucNavItemnavItem IDdata DefaultImageUrlResourcesdatadefault.png HoverImageUrlResourcesdatahover.png IconTextdata runatserver gt ltucNavItemnavItem IDsolutions DefaultImageUrlResourcessolutionsdefault.png HoverImageUrlResourcessolutionshover.png IconTextsolutions runatserver gt codepre  pThe javascript has fluctuated a bit and I dont really have a working copy right now, but the best result I was able to achieve so far was on mouse over the icon would change to the proper image, but only of the last item in the navigation menu ie item 1 would change to the hover over icon for item 4 when moused over, so it feels like some kind of scoping or instance issue though Im not entirely sure that those kind of issues exist in asp.netJShtml land.p  pSo, is there something different that needs done when working with JS and a repeated user control Is there some other way I should be going about what Im attempting to achieve Ive tried a bit of jquery also, but the samples Ive worked with havent really done anything, so Im probably setting something up incorrectly there.p  pAny advice to point me in the right directionp  pThanks in advance.p  pEDITp  pforgot to point out  the reason Im not doing a simple swap in the page load on    navImage.Attributes.Addonmouseover, updateImageToHover  NavImageElementId  p  pis because I want the image to change when the text is rolled over as well, and after I implement the JS swap, I will apply the solution to the text as well but a solution which applies to the outer div would be most welcome as well.p  pEDIT 2p  pJS that produces bad resultsp  precode function updateImageToHoverfullName      var hoverImageUrl   lt HoverImageUrlgt     var navImage  document.getElementByIdfullName.id     navImage.src  hoverImageUrl  codepre

Negative 1694 pI have recently completed a data layer for a PHP application. In my data layer I have various methods for executing different sql tasks such as selects, inserts, deletes, etc. Coming from a .NET background, I practice opening connections, doing whatever with the connection, and closing them. p  pIn a recent code review, I was questioned about this practice, and a colleague stated it was best to leave connections open for the life of the application. Their reasoning is that openingclosing connections is time consuming. My argument is that leaving them open is resource consuming. Following is a code sample from the data layer that executes a select query. I am fairly new to PHP so I dont really have a response for the critique.

Though I have tried various methods to fix this problem I still get the random errors. p  pAdditionally the only way to access the db is only by the Adminer wp plugin after I login to wordpress and via mysql command line. Adminer will not let me login if I use it as php script out of wordpress. I use mysql 5.5 with nginx 1.4.1 and php5fpm with unix socket. p  pStrangely enough the posts are not shown immediately after publish also after the migration. MySQL logs are always empty. The only workaround I found was that I had to manually restart the mysql daemon after the error in order to temporarily fix it until the next random error. p  pIn my mysql user passwords I include symbols. Is this somehow affecting the behaviour of the mysql server or the database connection Should I try to repair the database Any suggestionsp

Negative 1694 pI have a bit of a messy situation that I am hoping someone can offer a solution for. So please bare with me while I offer a bit of background.  Basically I am using javascript to communicate with a third party service.  As part of their authentication process they need the multipartform body of the post message including an image to be encrypted in md5, this is added to a string including the date, and a few other things and then a HMAcSHA1 run on it.  So in the end they have the multipart body, the date and the authentication hash in order to authenticate and then read the image.p  pThis works fine for all mobile devices except for windowsPhone .. I know, a problem with IE... who would have thought.  their httpwebrequest does not include a Date header .. so no authentication.  This means that I have to go native for windows phone and use the newly released httpclient code in C.  Now I am a C noob so this is possibly where the easy solution is.  I have gotten the authentication to work by passing pretty much everything to c and just doing the post using c but they cannot read the body because the only way I have found to send the boundary is when defining the content as multipartformDatacontent and sending the content that way changes the body so the authentication failes.p  pmy javascript is something likep  precodevar boundary  ThIsIstHebouNdaRY var part1Array  [] var part1  boundary  rn     ContentDisposition formdata nameimagern     ContentType imagejpgrn     rn var part3Array  [] var part3  rn  boundary  forvar p10 p1ltpart1.length p1     part1Array.pushpart1.charCodeAtp1  forvar p30 p3ltpart3.length p3     part3Array.pushpart3.charCodeAtp3  var bodyContent  part1Array.concatimageArray,part3Array  hash this  var authMessage  bodyContentHash n contentType n todayString n pathandstuff  hmac sha1 base64 codepre  pand the c isp  precodeHttpClient client  new HttpClient HttpRequestMessage request  new HttpRequestMessageHttpMethod.Post, path  request.Headers.Date  DateTime.ParseExacttodaydate, ddd, dd MMM yyyy HHmmss GMT, new CultureInfoenUS, DateTimeStyles.AssumeUniversal request.Headers.AddAccept, applicationjson charsetutf8 request.Headers.AddAuthorization, auth  byte[] body  Convert.FromBase64StringbodyData request.Content  new ByteArrayContentbody request.Content.Headers.ContentType  new MediaTypeHeaderValuemultipartformdata request.Content.Headers.Addboundary, ThIsIstHebouNdaRY  HttpResponseMessage response  client.SendAsyncrequest.Result string resultCode  response.StatusCode.ToString string responseBodyAsText  await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync codepre  pThis pretty much works.. the body content is correct as are the headers .. all except the content type header which should bep  precoderequest.Content.Headers.ContentType  new MediaTypeHeaderValuemultipartformdata, boundaryThIsIstHebouNdaRY codepre  pExcept that this throws a System.FormatException error. any help appreciated.p

Negative 1694 pShort version In Lotus Notes, is it possible to replace the design of a template with the design of a regular database I tried to make the database a template, so it would show up in the emReplace designem dialog, but it does not.p  pLong version Lets say I have a template called NewsTemplate.ntf on my dev. server which replicates to staging and prod. servers on demand. I do all development work in a database DevNews.nsf on the dev. server, which enables me to easily test the application in the web browser during development. When I want to deploy changes, this starts with manually copypasting changes from DevNews.nsf to NewsTemplate.ntf. Yuck... I can use the comparison tool in Domino Designer to compare the two and copy changes file by file, but this feels overly cumbersome. What I want to do is simply to replace the design of NewsTemplate.ntf with that of DevNews.nsf.p  pIn the emReplace designem dialog only templates are listed, so it seems I have to make DevNews.nsf a template to do this. I checked the emDatabase file is a master templateem checkbox in emApplication propertiesem and entered the template name DevNewsTemplate. However, it still does not show up in the list of templates in the emReplace designem dialog. I notice the database still has the file extension emnsfem. Is this the problem Is there some other approach I should rather be taking to copy design changes from News.nsf to NewsTemplate.ntfp  pBonus question 1 Can a template contain documents and work just like a database, only it is also a template which is used to distribute design to other templatesdatabasesp  pBonus question 2 a hrefhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenterdomhelpv8r0index.jsptopiccom.ibm.designer.domino.main.docHABOUTMAKINGANDDISTRIBUTINGDESIGNCHANGES.html relnofollowThis sitea mentions templates and master templates, but it does not really explain what the difference between them is. What is the difference between a template and a master template How do I make a template How do I make a master templatep  pstrongEditstrongp  pLets say instead of the single News.nsf database on the dev. server, there are two development databases called News1.nsf and News2.nsf, because there are two developers who need their own database to work in. Each developer has his News.nsf which resides on the dev. server synchronized with an ondiskproject on his own PC, which is under source control with Git. The two developers git repos keep in synch by pushing topulling from a central Git repo, so News1.nsf and News2.nsf are indirectly synchronized via this Git repo.p  pEach developer needs to be able to copy changes from his News.nsf to NewsTemplate.ntf. The solution suggested by Panu Haaramo using emRefresh designem requires me to set NewsTemplate.ntf to inherit design from DevNewsTemplate, which is the master template name I set for News1.nsf. Obviously I cannot use the same master template name for News2.nsf, since it resides on the same dev. server as News1.nsf. How can I interchangeably copy design from either News1.nsf or News2.nsf to NewsTemplate.ntfp  pThis figure should help with clarificationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV7VYH.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1694 pOk so for school I have to currently make a program that can handle Rational number arithmetic. I have this part of my code completely done but a secondary part of the assignment is to create two custom exception classes. The first exception class was easy to create and was just a null object handling class. But the class I cant figure out is the custom divide by zero class. The problem is that we have specific parameters for the class which arep  precodeClass  DivideByZeroException Constructors  DivideByZeroException, DivideByZeroException Rational rational Instance Fields  Rational rational  Public Methods  Rational getRational  String getMessage  override codepre  pThe issue Im having is that I dont have a any idea why its necessary to Override getMessage when the class must extend RunTimeException thus enabling the supermessage call. Here is the source code for the class which can throw the exceptions and the class that should handle them.

Negative 1694 pIve been experimenting with breezejs lately and was considering using it for a number of projects both personal and at work since I love it. I know all the rage right now is with Single Page Apps and I get it, but lets say you didnt want to introduce a new routing framework and were comfortable just using .NET MVCs default routing engine. You will lose the client side caching capabilities of breezes entity manager for the Metadata and other entities every time there is a POSTRedirect. p  pOne of the issues is we have a large set of Metadata .5mb coming down for each request made. Now if there any additional requests on the client side before redirect then that metadata is cached and everything is fine. Im trying to avoid the need to download the metadata for each view in addition to static lists that I would also cache in the entity manager. I know the metadata could be optimized by making smaller object graphs but lets not focus on that.p  pThe one thing I came up with is to store the metadata in localStorage then retrieve it on page load. p  precodefunction exportMetadata     var metadata  emanager.metadataStore.exportMetadata    window.localStorage.setItemsomename, metadata  function importMetadata     var metadata  window.localStorage.getItemsomename    var mstore  new breeze.MetadataStore    mstore.importMetadatametadataFromStorage    manager.metadataStore  mstore  codepre  pWhile this works and will work for static lists with different syntax it feels hacky and seems to go against how the library was meant to be used. I cant help but think that BreezeJS is coupled to the SPA architecture to utilized all of its features as written. Maybe Im thinking about it the wrong way Are there any suggestions or examples of how to use BreezeJS outside a SPAp

It would be great to have some sort of a switch in app config to use one or the other.  I know that is possible to have both in the same app you can have Mongo config and JPA config. Usually it is done to store different domain objects one type stored and retrieved from Mongo and the other one is stored and retrieved relational database. In these types of projects there are two domain models that serve corresponding persistence mechanisms. p  pIs there a way to have some sort of an abstract data model, two implementation for it and config switch that will either use MongoDB or Postgres  p

After noticing how it doesnt work in IE on my WP8 device a Lumia 822, I began googling the issue, and it seems to be a pretty well known issue. So the solution I found, and tried, came from herep  pa hrefhttptimkadlec.com201301windowsphone8anddevicewidth relnofollowhttptimkadlec.com201301windowsphone8anddevicewidthap  pIt seems pretty straightforward, in that I add the five lines to the top of my CSSp  precodewebkitviewportwidthdevicewidth mozviewportwidthdevicewidth msviewportwidthdevicewidth oviewportwidthdevicewidth viewportwidthdevicewidth codepre  pAnd then add some JS to detect the IE Mobile browser from the UA. I have two issues with thatp  pFirst  When I codealertcode my user agent string, I get the following from my WP8 devicep  blockquote   pMozilla4.0 compatible MSIE 7.0Windows Phone OS 7.0 Trident3.1IEMobile7.0NOKIA Lumia 822p blockquote  pAccording to the article above, and a hrefhttpjonathanstark.comblogwindowsphone8useragentstring relnofollowstrongthis articlestronga, it should be IEMobile10.0 instead. Any ideas on why mine is different This appears to be the strongWindows Phone 7 user agent stringstrong. Why would my WP8 device show thatp  pBecause of that difference, I had to change the JS to match 7.0 instead of 10, otherwise the codeifcode condition would never be met. p  pSo, even still, with my code above, nothing happens, and my screen loads white on my WP8 device. Can anyone see what Im doing wrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIt appears the JS was throwing an errorp  blockquote   pUnexpected call to method or property accessp blockquote  pSo I found a solution for that, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions436710elementappendchildchokesinieherea p  precodeif navigator.userAgent.matchIEMobile7.0      var s  document.createElementstyle    s.setAttributetype, textcss    var cssText  msviewportwidthautoimportant    ifs.styleSheet   IE does it this way     s.styleSheet.cssText  cssText     else   everyone else does it this way     s.appendChilddocument.createTextNodecssText      document.getElementsByTagNamehead[0].appendChilds   codepre  pBut, even now that the code executes successfully, my media queries are still ignored and I still see a white page load.

Negative 1694 pI am currently using Clang on the latests OSX to build a static library in C11 and came across something that seems odd to me.p  pI have class C that inherits from A and B. A is used as a public interface for the users of the class and B is used as an abstract implementation, holding methods that are common to all instances of A. I come from the Java world so Im treating A as an interface and B as an abstract class.p  pIn class C I have a method that is inherited from B that calls two private methods defined in C. And herein lies the weirdness. If I implement the inherited method like thisp  precodebool EPubParserisCorrectFileType    bool hascorrectfiletype  false   bool iscompressedfile  thisgtisCompressedFile   if thisgthasRightExtension ampamp iscompressedfile      hascorrectfiletype  true       if hascorrectfiletype      LOGDEBUGltlt Has correct file type.  ltlt endl    else      LOGDEBUGltlt Does not have correct file type.  ltlt endl      return hascorrectfiletype  codepre  peverything works fine. I can see log statements in codethisgtisCompressedFilecode being called. If I remove the temporary variable codeiscompressedfilecode and call codethisgtisCompressedFilecode directly in the condition, they dont get called. Its as if the method doesnt exist.p  pAm I missing something about C Is this a Clang bug Is my Java background tripping me upp

I think in order to use a group by clause the query would have to be based off the purchase table but I need the query to use the contact table so that all contacts are listed with their total purchase amounts and other relevant client data. Is there any way to do this within one queryp  pTo further clarifyp  pThis query is being generated as part of a search engine. An example of why a query like this would be done is if a user wanted to generate a contact list of lastnames starting with A with purchases of a specific item or as in this example of purchases for a specific date.  So that in general the query would have to generate a list of all contacts and their data with possible search criteria on the type of contact such as all lastnames starting with A etc. and the query can also include search criteria on the purchase table such as the date of the purchase and whether the purchase was for specific items etc.p  pI am trying to add in the option to also list the sum of the purchases for the contact however that sum has to be limited to the search criteria for the purchase table as well and not the sum of all the contacts purchases.p

Negative 1694 pI need to show a pop up in chrome extension.Presently the pop up is showing in a new window    when the extension icon is clicked.What I need is that when I click on the extension a popup window should be seen just below the extension icon.Just like this a hrefhttpdeveloper.chrome.comextensionsgetstarted.html.please relnofollowhttpdeveloper.chrome.comextensionsgetstarted.html.pleasea check the pop up in this link.My pop up windowuserinfo.html asks for a login with username and password.When the user enters both username and passwrd, and logins,the pop up should be closed and when the user again clicks on extension icon,it should navigate to a website. How can I do this Here is my background.jsp  precodechrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListenerfunctiontab  iflocalStorage.username chrome.browserAction.setPopup     popup userinfo.html    codepre  pelse     navigate to website      In this way,i show my pop up.When the user clicks on the icon for the first time after installation the pop up appears.otherwise it navigates to a website.Now my problem is that when i click twice on the icon only,the pop up appears.second problem is that,after i enter name and pwd and clicks login the pop up closes,which is fine..when i clicked again on icon actually it should navigate to the website,but in my code it again shows pop up.When I reload the extension,it works correctly.why is it like thatplease help me. There is a file named userinfo.html,which should be shown as a pop up.How can I do thisPlease help me.p

Negative 1694 pI am developing a Qt5 server application and I am using the QAMQP library. What I want to do is the followingp  ul liAnother server should send a message whenever something about a user should changeli liMy server, which is distributed among multiple machines and has multiple processes per machine needs to be notified about these updatesli ul  pThe thing is, I am not sure about the architecture that I should build. I just know that whenever something about some user changes, the server needs to send a message to the RabbitMQ broker and all my processes that are interested in updates for that particular user should get the message. But should I create one queue per process, and bind it with a separate exchange for each user Or maybe create in each process a separate queue for each user and bind that somehow to some exchange. Fanout exchanges come to mind, and one queue per process, I am just not sure about the queueexchange relations even though Ive spent quiet some time trying to figure it out.p  pstrongUpdate, in order to clarify things and write about the progressstrongp  pI have a distributed application that needs to be notified for product changes. Those changes happen often and are tracked by another platform. I want to get those updates in my application. In order to achieve that, each one of my application instances creates its own queue. Then, whenever an instance is interested in updates for a particular product it creates an exchange for that product and binds it to the queue, like thisp  precodeExchange type  direct Exchange name  productupdate Routing key    PRODUCTCODE codepre  pWhere PRODUCTCODE is a string that represents the code of the product. In the platform that track the changes, I just publish messages with the corresponding exchanges.p  pThe problem comes when i need to unsubscribe for a product update. I am using the QAMQP library, and in the destructor of the QAMQPExchange theres an unconditional remove call. When that function is called I am getting error in the RabbitMQ log, which looks like thisp  precodeERROR REPORT 28Jan2014084135  connection lt0.937.0gt, channel 7  soft error amqperror,preconditionfailed,             exchange productupdate in vhost testapp in use,             exchange.delete codepre  pI am not sure how to properly unsubscribe. I know from the RabbitMQ web interface that I have only one exchange productupdate which has bindings to multiple queues with difference routing keys. I can see that the call to remove in QAMQP tries to delete the exchange, but since its used by my other processes, its still in use and cannot be removed, which I beleive is ok. But what should I do to delete the exchange object that I created Should I first unbind it from the queue I believe that i should be able to delete the object without calling remove, but I may be mistaken or I may doing it wrong.p  pAlso, if theres a better pattern for what I am trying to accomplish, please advice.p  pHeres some sample code, per request.p  precodeProductUpdaterProductUpdaterQObject parent  QObjectparent      mClient  new QAMQPClientthis     mClientgtsetAutoReconnecttrue     mClientgtopenmConnStr     connectmClient, SIGNALconnected, this, SLOTamqpconnected   void ProductUpdateramqpconnected      mQueue  mClientgtcreateQueue      connectmQueue, SIGNALdeclared,   this, SLOTamqpqueuedeclared     connectmQueue, SIGNALmessageReceivedQAMQPQueue,                this, SLOTmessagereceivedQAMQPQueue      mQueuegtsetNoAckfalse     mQueuegtdeclareQString, QAMQPQueueQueueOptionsQAMQPQueueAutoDelete   void ProductUpdateramqpqueuedeclared      mQueuegtconsume   void ProductUpdateramqpexchangedeclared      QAMQPExchange exchange  qobjectcastltQAMQPExchangegtsender     if mKeys.containsexchange         mQueuegtbindexchange, mKeys.valueexchange   void ProductUpdatermessagereceivedQAMQPQueue queue      while queuegthasMessage              const QAMQPMessagePtr message  queuegtgetMessage         processMessagemessage          if queuegtnoAck             queuegtackmessage        bool ProductUpdatersubscribeconst QStringamp productId      if mClient         return false      foreach const QStringamp id, mSubscriptions          if id  productId             return true  already subscribed           QAMQPExchange exchange  mClientgtcreateExchangeproductupdate     mSubscriptions.insertproductId, exchange     connectexchange, SIGNALdeclared, this, SLOTamqpexchangedeclared     exchangegtdeclareQStringLiteraldirect      return true   void ProductUpdaterunsubscribeconst QStringamp productId      if mSubscriptions.containsproductId         return      QAMQPExchange exchange  mSubscriptions.takeproductId      if exchange           This may even be unnecessary...         mQueuegtunbindexchange, productId           This will produce an error in the RabbitMQ log          But if exchange isnt destroyed, we have a memory leak          if we do exchangegtdeleteLater itll also produce an error...          exchangegtremove       codepre

The class shown above is intended to run tasks periodically in the main thread. In the do stuff comment theres actually code that updates a codeTextViewcode with a value passed to the codeMyRunnablecode constructor. The activity cancels the current runnable and starts a new one when certain intents are received. Despite the current runnable is always requested to cancel itself before the new one is created, sometimes it is being left running along with the new one, so the text view is showing alternating values. This is not the intended behavior.p  pI thought if the runnable was currently running in the main thread, it would run until completion, and then other runnables or event handlers would be taken out of the queue and executed if needed, but no pending event or runnable could be half executed.p  pThere are two kinds of tasks running in the main thread that are related to the problemp  ul liR1 The codeMyRunnablecode selfscheduling task. Runs and then it selfposts itself again with a delay of 1s.li liR2 The event handlers that request cancellation of the current codeMyRunnablecode instance and create a new R1. These happen randomly and are executed only once.li ul  pIve contemplated two scenarios. The first onep  ol liR1 is already running in the main thread.li liR2 arrives and is enqueued in the main thread.li liR1 finishes running and posts itself again.li liR2 runs and removes callbacks for R1.li liR1 should never run again.li ol  pAnd the second onep  ol liR1 is not running but is scheduled.li liR2 arrives and removes callbacks for R1.li liR1 should never run again.li ol  pTheoretically, if theres no preemtion, and theres only a single thread, how comes sometimes there are two R1s in the main threadp
Negative 1694 pWe are using LibCurl for our SetTop Box applications. It is used in multithreaded environment and we may open multiple curl handles at the same time but we close it as soon as the download is done. p  pIt seems like while opening the curl handle no matter how much we download, curl allocates some memory which increases as the number of curl handle increases I tested a scenario with 100 threads  where about 30Mb of memory is allocated in advance. as soon as we call curleasyinitthere is jump in the memory which is not deallocated after the handle is destroyedp  pIn our applications, For example one curl handle may be just used to see if the server is up or not  but even this is costing us memory.p  pMemory is very critical in our scenario. So, we do not want curl to cache that much of memory in advance.p  pIs there any suggestions that can help us to reduce the memory cached by curlp

They dont actually represent a row or columnp  pHowever, this does not work the way it used to. What Im trying to do is to have two rows of 66 width columns above each other, and then next to them, a larger single 33 width column to the right of them. Instead, Ive got the the first two sections on one line, taking up a total of 66 width so each section is 33 width, and then the next section ends up underneath it.p  pIdeally, I want to use the flex code, so that I can use up all available space, but Im still new to it, and dont know my way around it very well. The problem with using percentage widths is that even after whitespace removal, things still break to the next line when zoomed in enough, and I think that the flex method is more elegant and modern anyway.p

Negative 1694 pIm designing a program that Id like to be able to notice when a user clicks on a link to or on a certain set of websites to download and process a file from that website without the user having to go through the sites interface, download the file with their browser, and feed it into the program.p  pIve seen similar programs do this, but they work by replacing the codehttpcode prefix in the URL with something custom that the browser knows to send to the program. That isnt an option here the site already exists, and I dont have control over it.p  pThe next solution that springs to mind is a browser plugin, but thats an awfully inelegant way of implementing this it forces the user to use a certain set of browsers if he wants to use my program, and requires me to write and indeed learn how to write plugins for whatever browsers I want to support. What might work is a Greasemonkey script that implements the solution above, but thats still pretty hackish and requires the user to download and install stuff he doesnt really want.p  pThe third solution I can think of is setting the program up as a proxy like some ransomware programs do, but that would be an incredibly nasty hack. Id rather my program not completely screw over the users internet connection if theres a problem, nor do I want it to have to run all the time.p  pOne more solution I can think of is more of a compromise at least in Windows the user ought to be able to click and drag the link into the program window and have it extract the link that way. That is a pretty elegant way to do things, and Ill probably implement it as a fallback, but Im not sure how it would work under MacOS and its not quite the oneclick solution I was going for the entire point of this program is that it can be used with an absolute minimum of actual user interaction.p  pThe language I intend to implement this in is Python 3.3. Anyone have any better ideas p

Negative 1694 pI want to build kind of an automatic system to update some race results for a championship. I have an automated spreadsheet were all the results are shown but it takes me a lot to update all of them so I was wondering if it would be possible to make a form in order to update them more easily.p  pIn the form I will enter the driver name and the number o points he won on a race. The championship has 4 races each month so yea, my question is if you guys know a way to update an existing data stored in a spreadsheet using a form. Lets say that in the first race, the driver X won 10 points. I will insert this data in a form and then call it from the spreadsheet to show it up, thats right. The problem comes when I want to update the second race results and so on. If the driver X gets on the second race 12 points, is there a way to update the previous 10 points of that driver and put 22 points instead Or can I add the second race result to the first one automatically I mean, if I insert on the form the second race results can it look for the driver X entry and add this points to the ones that it previously had. Dunno if its possible or not.p  pMaybe I can do it in another way. Any help will be much appreciated Thanks.p

Negative 1694 pI have process A that runs every 5 minutes and needs to write something in table EventLog. This works all day long but at night there is another process B starting that needs to delete a lot of old data from this table. The table has millions of rows blobs included and many related tables deletion by cascade so process B runs up to 45 minutes. While process B is running I get a lot of deadlock warnings for process A and I want to get rid of these.p  pThe easy option would be Dont run process A when process B is running but there must be a better approach. I am using EntityFramework 6 and TransactionScope in both processes. I didnt find out how to set priority or something like that on my processes. Is this possiblep  pstrongEDITstrong I forgot to say that I am already using one delete transaction per record, not one transaction for all records. Inside loop I create new DBContext and TransactionScope, so each record has its own transaction. My problem is that deleting a record still takes some time because of the related BLOBs and data in other related tables lets say about 5 sec. per row. I still get deadlock situations when deleting process B crosses with inserting process A.p

Negative 1694 pI am new to access and creating a few Access Database based applications for our startup and have used this forum extensively to get solutions whenever I get stuck. p  pThis is my first post here, because I am stuck at one point, for which I could find the solution, but I think there could be a better solution for that. p  pstrongOur requirement strongp  pWe have few suppliers and we want to generate a monthly report of purchases from each supplier during the month and export to excel. I think the solution is to create a parameter query where I can pass the value of the supplier ID, Month and Year. The list of supplier keeps changing and is stored in a separate table. So, basically, I should be able to sequentially read the supplier ID from that table and pass as a parameter to my query to generate the report for that supplier. p  pstrongThe closest solutionsstrong that I found for my requirement was on which are similar in nature  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16336025exportingrecordsettospreadsheet2195546021955460Exporting Recordset to Spreadsheetap  pa hrefhttpanswers.microsoft.comenusofficeforumoffice2010customizefilteringaqueryusedbydocmdtransferspreadsheet06d8a16ccece4f0389dc89d240436693 relnofollowhttpanswers.microsoft.comenusofficeforumoffice2010customizefilteringaqueryusedbydocmdtransferspreadsheet06d8a16ccece4f0389dc89d240436693ap  pstrongWhy I think there could be a better solution strongp  pIn the suggested solution, we are creating multiple queries and deleting these.

Negative 1694 pI am wanting to make an applet for practice, and my goal is to make a program that displays seven rectangles with info inside of each one. I would also like the cards to display in a random order.p  pAfter the cards are displayed, the user should be able to click on the card, and then the card should be removed from the options and be displayed beneath them, in the order that you click them. This may sound confusing, but I basically want the user to be able to prioritize or sort the info cards.p  pFor example, if the cards had dates on them, the user could sort them in order from past to present.p  pMy first idea was to draw rectangles on the screen and get the mouse click x and y to see if the user clicked that card, but Im sure that there is another way that doesnt have to be that complicated.p  pIm sorry that I dont have decent code to post, I would rather not post my messy version. I can update this with code later.p  pIm wondering what the best solution would be, because I would like to learn as much as I can from this project.p

Negative 1694 pI have some popover with a table inside. Table contains default cells with some titles codecell[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier someIdentifier]code no accessories.p  pNow i need to make popover as small as possible and do not clip text no ellipsis. Height is not a problem it is easy to fetch. I have problem with width. Previously I just measured the size of texts from table code[text sizeWithFont font].widthcode by selecting  the longest and added 20 points to result width and it was ok. Now in iOS7 this fails since cell is bit different and ellipsis is shown for the longest text.p  pIs there a good way to detect table table cell width Ive tried with code[cell sizeToFit someBigSize]code but this always returns codewidth320code. Ive tried this hoping that I will become resistant to iOS changes.p  pOr is there a specification about table cells and its layout text margins and so on, I didnt managed to find anything useful.p  pWorst case scenario I could manually figure out what is proper value to be added to maximum text width, but I prefer some documentation for that.p

Negative 1694 pI am trying to illustrate the effects of inlining a function on a basic C example. I have been doing this using Visual Studio 2012 but the problem is when I go to look at the inlined code the releasemode doesnt allow me to see the assembly in the Disassembly window. When I output the assembly file the assembly is really not readable and doesnt look vaguely correct.p  pI was wondering either somebody knows a solution to the Visual Studio Disassembly release mode problem, or is there another idea where I could see the inlined assembly very easily like the VS Disassembly window in debug mode.p

Im developing a simple app and routing all urls with the exception of a few through the main index.php page.  so for example mysite.comtest goes goes to index.php, then determines in php what the url is and loads the appropriate page.  p  pMy issue is that I need to exclude email verifications, or other potential future exceptions from this rule.  An example of an email verification link is a hrefhttpmyrul.comphploginadvancedregister.phpid2ampverificationcode relnofollowhttpmyrul.comphploginadvancedregister.phpid2ampverificationcodea..... etc.   p  pSo... is there a way to exclude a url from the rewrite rules that starts with certain characters. php would do the trick in this case.p  pMy current rewrite conditions are p  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteCond 1 index.phpampregister.phpphp cssimagesjavascriptrobots.txtfavicon.ico RewriteRule . index.php1 [L] codepre

Negative 1694 pExcel 2013. I plotted two different dependent variables yvalue versus their shared fixed variable xaxis. This used to be easy for me with prior Excel versions. But the only success Ive had so far with the Windows 365 version of Excel is to get bars shown for one variable and the much preferable markers for the other. Most of the questions Ive found in here seem to use VBA or additional software programs which I am certain, for what i want, to be unnecessary. Will someone please tell me the easy Excel 2013 procedure for doing this And please reassure me that when I learn how to use those new offtotheside areas and icons, that I will once again love graphing capabilities of Excel.p

As adobe managed to integrate flash with android browser, there should be a possibility to access NFC from browser also. p  pDid google allow flash through via backdoor As I understand that it is a huge security risk for web browser to access device hardware, but I think it can be donep  pAnyone of you have some knowledge to share with mep  pI have written android app to communicate with NFC but now I would like to access it via browser.p

Negative 1694 pI am trying to write a program that will solve a maze using a class and a tree.  I am trying to use a class to represent the maze the design will be entered using cin, and the class contains a struct as a private member.p  pThis struct contains two ints for the x and y coordinate of the position and an array with 3 spaces that will hold three pointers to other structs.p  pIn the constructor function for my class, I am trying to set all the pointers in the array to NULL to start off.  The program compiles fine, but when I get to the constructor the program gives me a segmentation fault.  Here is some relevant codep  precodeconst int POSSIBLEBRANCHES  3 at any point the path can split in 3 ways  struct PathNode      int xcoord     int ycoord     PathList branches[POSSIBLEBRANCHES]  typedef PathNode PathList  class Maze      private         PathList initialpos     public         Maze  codepre  pAnd the constructorp  precodeMazeMaze       cout ltlt entered constructor ltlt endl      for int i  0 i lt POSSIBLEBRANCHES i                 initialposgtbranches[i]  NULL         codepre  pI get the entered constructor phrase printed out, but the program stops immediately afterwards.  I am assuming it is some silly problem with my pointer syntax, but I have been unable to locate the problem.p  pAs I understand it the  operator dereferences the pointer to the PathNode struct, so now we have access to the members like xcoord, ycoord, and branches.  The [] operator gets to each index of the branches array.  And because it is an array of pointers to PathNodes, setting them as NULL should be fine.  Where is the flaw in my reasoningp  pEdit  Solved.  See the answer marked as best.p

It all works just fine.p  pThe problem I have is after every logoffreboot, the SSH agent does not automatically add the my keys because, it seems, it only looks for the default named keys, as stated by GitHug at a hrefhttpshelp.github.comarticleserrorpermissiondeniedpublickeymakesureyouhaveakeythatisbeingused relnofollowError Permission denied public key Make sure you have a key that is being useda.p  pIs there a way to define what keys the SSH agent should automatically add upon loading or will I have to manually add them each time Possibly create a script that opens upon logon and adds them.p

Negative 1694 pRecently Ive been working with Three.js in order to render 3D scenes in WebGL. As a fallback, Ive also maintained versions using Threes CanvasRenderer that, while they do not have as many polygons, lighting techniques, or effects, can still run in browsers that do not have WebGL capability and can also run in Safari if the user refuses to enable WebGL themselves.p  pHowever, today I realized that compatibility is not merely a question of whether or not the users browser supports WebGL, but also whether the users hardware is even rigorous enough to perfectly render WebGL in the first place i.e. run at 60 fps. While there is a lot of data out there illustrating what percentage of the population uses which web browser, I had trouble finding distributions of users who are running computers more than capable of running WebGL. p  pWhat exactly is the percentage of the population that  assuming they are using a WebGL capable web browser  can run your average WebGL page at 60 fps And if it is a large amount of the population who struggle with rendering in WebGL, what would be the best way to detect such shortcomings in hardware A javascript solution would be ideal since we are already working with Three in that language.p  pIt is very possible that I may be misunderstanding the situation as this does not seem to be a widely discussed issue in the world of WebGL development. If such is the case please let me know so I may better understand how to work with Three in the future.p

For the sake of maintaining old links, this structure needs to  stay intact. However, the site also has custom post types in a resources section of the site that are now showing up as domainname.comblogresourcescustomposttype. I would like to change domainname.comblogresources to just domainname.comresourcesp  pI have tried a few different ReWrite rules that I found on this site, the latest being RewriteRule blogresources.  resources1  [R] but with no luck. If anyone is able to provide a working solution that would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1694 pMy problem is quite generic I know that I have a JavaScript issue somewhere. Now I dont know how to start searching where the problem could be. Usually I use the Firefox builtin or the Firebug Debugger. I know how to use it in general. But what I dont know is where to start. Where should I set breakpoints I often have this kind of problem.p  pAs an example which is my current problem I have a page with an unordered list. Every second list item is empty for some reason. I can see that the page gets loaded with proper list items. But then some JavaScript seems to add those empty items. Its a Yii application that inserts some JavaScript directly into the HTML but let the browser also load jquery.js, bootstrap.js and yii.js. I havent added any own JavaScript.p  pNow, as I said, I dont know where to start to find the problem. It might be that I have done something wrong with some configuration. But it could also be bug. I just want to figure it out somehow.p  pWith my current issue, the best would be to have a breakpoint on a function like onInsertEmptyListItemToCounfuseDeveloper ...p  pI dont want a solution to my current issue. Id like to know in general, where and how to start finding JavaScript related problems. Especially, with thirdparty JS. With some applications CMS, shops,... there are sometimes a lot of JS files. This makes it more worser.p  pI hope this question is answerable and you can provide some experiences.p

Negative 1694 pI have a Windows application that is written in C. I have a vector of strings that I need to pass to a python Script for processing. I know how to embed python in C with simple type but I am looking at how to create a python object equivalent to a vector of string. I am looking at something likep  precodefor sizet i  0 i lt myvector.size i      PyUnicodeFromString.appendmyvector[i]  codepre  por maybep  precodefor sizet i  0 i lt myvector.size i      pValue  PyUnicodeFromStringmyvector[i]     pyTupleSetItemmyvector.size, i, pValue  codepre  pThe vector will hardly ever get very large 100 items max I would say. At the moment I am just saving a text file and I have the python script opening it and processing it which is obviously not very good but it tells me that everything else works as planned. The processing from the Python script produce 4 values per item3 strings and 1 integerlong. I also need to return this the the main C program and I have no idea how to go about that. EDIT After reviewing the possible options, I am thinking of a list of lists since dictionaries are not ordered and require more parsing operations should do the trick but I dont know how I would go about decoding this back inside the C program again for now this is done with file writingreading so I know it works. If anyone has done this, can you please provide small code snippets so I can adapt it to my needs. I should also mention that I cannot use the boost libraryand preferably no SWIG either  so, basically done in Python CAPI. All examples I have seen talks about subprocesses or NumPy which I do not believe maybe incorrectly apply to my case.p

Negative 1694 pI have been working with a GitHuboffered package UIAComWrapper for about 4 months now.p  pI have come to learn a lot about it, and its limitations.p  pI have also learned that I need to be resourceful on my own, because there is very little documentation andor forums that discuss issues on this package.p  pThe class within the package I have used the most is AutomationElement.  Please do not confuse this with Microsofts version.  Think of these as actionable text boxes in a browser, like search fields, or form textboxes name, address, etc  p  pAutomationElement is provided an event handler for when one of its objects receives focus.  That tests nicely.  However, nowhere in this package can I find a reliable way to handle when the same AutomationElement loses focus.p  pI wont be able to submit code examples.  This question is an SOS to those who have had the misfortune of working with UIAComWrapper.  p

Negative 1694 pI have a set of C DLLs that have already been builttheyve gone through the process of setting the version numbers in AssemblyInfo.cs, theyve been formally built by our configuration management team, and theyve been archived off where they belong so we dont lose the built DLLs.p  pNow I have to take a collection of these DLLs and package them up into a couple umbrellas, and these umbrellas can have different versions. For examplep  precodeCollection1 v1.0  Collection1 v1.1  Collection2 v1.0      MyDll1.dll v1.0   MyDll1.dll v1.0   MyDll1.dll v1.0 MyDll2.dll v1.1   MyDll2.dll v1.2   MyDll4.dll v1.0 MyDll3.dll v1.2   MyDll3.dll v1.2   MyDll5.dll v1.1 codepre  pLooking through each DLLs properties, I already see its usual fields, including File version and Product version set to its respective version number.p  pWhat I would like to do is to capture the collection name and version number somewhere in order to show which collection it belonged to when it was packaged up. Again, the DLLs are already built, so I cant add anything to AssemblyInfo.cs now.p  pIdeally, this would be another property that shows up on the DLLs Details tab, and it would be something that I can inject into a DLL using some tool, but Im not familiar with any Windows API calls that can addmodify these properties.p  pKeep in mind this is for internal releases of these DLLs so we can keep track of what we have installed ourselves during development the ones that will be packaged and released for real would be the pristine ones formally built and wont have any properties added into them.p  pEDIT Thirdparty tools will be difficult to use if it doesnt come with Windows or Visual Studio, then it would be strongly preferred if its something that can be written very quickly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1694 pIm trying to study for an upcoming data structures exam and am having a little trouble understanding this practice question. I apologize if it seems a little homeworkish, but I could really use some clarification on these concepts. The question is belowp  pConsider two binary search trees A and B. BST A has m nodes, and BST B has n nodes. Assume m is much greater than n. We wish to find the intersection of values from the two trees i.e., we wish to identify all values in BST A which are also found in BST B. Give the most efficient answer in each case. a We will perform an inorder traversal of BST A, and for each value we will perform a search in BST B for that value. What is the worstcase running time of this approachp  pb We will perform an inorder traversal of BST A, dumping the values into a list. We will do the same for BST B. Then we will find the intersection of the two lists. What is the worstcase running time3p  pNow assume A and B are AVL trees.p  pc We will perform an inorder traversal of AVL tree A, and for each value we will perform a search in AVL tree B for that value. What is the worstcase running time of this approachp  pd We will perform an inorder traversal of AVL tree A, dumping the values into a list. We will do the same for AVL tree B. Then we will find the intersection of the two lists. What is the worstcase running timep  pI think these should be relatively straightforward answers, but I feel like my solutions are too simple and Im wondering if anybody can propose a better solution.p  pA  Would this simply be Om  n worst case runtime I cant think of anything else, since the worst case search for a BST is On time.p  pB  This one is a little tricky. I believe you could create two iterators for the two lists and determine the intersections in Omn time by traversing the two trees once and then iterating through both sorted lists once, but Im also unsure if this is the most efficient way.p  pC  Similar to A, except  OMlogn  runtime because AVL tree worst case runtime is logn instead of n. p  pD  This one really has me stumped, I cant think of any reason why it would be different than B.p  pAny help would be appreciated on understanding this exercise I find complexity analysis really interesting, but also quite confusing at times when I consider all the what ifs when trying to calculate stuff.p

Im looking for a data structure preferably in java that can hold these stronglist of pairs in each rowstrong in a keyvalue pair fashion.p  pGoals and Assumptions p  ol liInput Key will be unique  there wont be any duplicate key, so hash code might be used in design if it helps constant lookups, no need to handle hash code collisionsli liValue should be accessible in constant time by passing key as inputli liNo of pairs in a line is always same so no need to bother about dynamic re  size of the data structureli liwell be accessing one row at time using key and get the corresponding valueli ol  pNote  Im already aware of HashMap and its internal implementation in java. Im just trying to avoid the structural overhead for this particular type of data set  p  pThe intent is to get the value of any attribute in a given row in a constant time by passing key. Ill be dealing with ONLY ONE row at a time and I want to get the value of say attr1 in that row and if its true do something. Hope this makes it clear.p  pIve only two ideas p  ol liUsing HashMap is the most obvious solutionli lipHaving a list of     Pair objects with key,value as instance variables and do a binary     search in the sorted list which is Ologn  some time for the     equals checkp  pIm looking if theres a better way than this  Any ideas  thoughts on this pli ol

Negative 1694 pI am using protobufnet to serializedeserialize my objects in my game.p  pMy game is similar to Simcity, and simulates your cities growth. I store this simulation data and load it up again every time the user starts the game. p  pAll works fine, but I would like to reduce the size of my save files. I will be grossly simplifying my code here but I just want to try and get the question across as clearly as I can...p  pEvery building in the city stores some metadata which describes the type of building it is  what mesh to use to render it, residential capacity, etc. I defined a whole bunch of these StructureDefinitions in my editor. When the game starts, the game manager loads a list of these predefined StructureDefinitions and the simulation will assign a definition to buildings that spawn in the city. So the buildings merely hold a reference to their StructureDefinitions.p  pEvery structure definition has a unique ID value, which is just an integer. Instead of serializing the StructureDefinition for every building when the game saves, itd be enough to just store the structure definitions ID value. Then, when my object is being deserialized, I take this ID value and request the actual StructureDefinition object from the game manager. All we need to serialize is this single integer. Here is what my class might look likep  precodepublic class Structure      public StructureDefinition Definition  codepre  pStructureDefintion has a public ID member codeDefinition.IDcode There is also a static DataLibrary class which will return the correct StructureDefintion if you call the following static function p  precodeDataLibrary.GetStructureDefinitionint ID codepre  pIve got everything I need here for it to work the way I want, I just dont know how to do it with Protobuf, or if it is even possible.p

Negative 1694 pIve run into an issue that only seems to a problem in Safari. I have an overlay that is set to codedisplaynonecode in its css. When the user clicks submit I want the overlay to show until processing is finished. I did this initially by just binding this to the buttons codeonclick...code function in jquery. This worked just fine except in Safari. Safari wants to execute the submit before the calls in the click. So, based on some other things I found I instead put this all on the submit event for the form instead of the click and used a timeout object set to 0. Like thisp  precodetcmishopcartcheckout.submitfunction     var showOverlay  functionprocessingoverlay.cssdisplay,block      setTimeoutshowOverlay,0  codepre  pThis, again, works in all other browsers except Safari.

Negative 1694 pI have a project, were I define some classes to be called in different environments, so I have multiple test tasks, which contain this test.

Negative 1694 pI know there is a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualMobileHIGLaunchImages.html relnofollowHIGa about launch images, and the primary and only purpose of an launch image is to give users the impression that  app is fast and responsive.p  pBut this is more usual for applications weather application for example, not for the games. Every game almost always has splash screen and thats how things should be in the games or thats just me .p  pIn many games it can be seen that launch image is used as a splash screen, or promotional material for showing things like logos... So what would be a proper way for a game to have a splash screen Is it better to follow the HIG and make an screenshot of user interface without elements, just background so that user really have an impression that app is loaded instantly and after launch image is removed, to show a splash screen Or as another option, to use launch image as a splash screenlike in many gamesp  pThere is a problem when using launch image as a splash screen because on newer devices loading time take just about second or less and I think that some kind of delaying launch image is not a good solution. So what is the preferred way to having a splash screen before game starts, what do you guys recommendp

Negative 1694 pIm pretty new to Cuda and Thrust, but my impression was that Thrust, when used well, is supposed to offer better performance than naively written Cuda kernels. Am I using Thrust in a suboptimal way Below is a complete, minimal example that takes an array codeucode of length codeN2code, and for each codeicode between code1code and codeNcode computes the average code0.5u[i1]  u[i1]code and puts the result in codeuNew[i]code. codeuNew[0]code is set to codeu[0]code and codeu[N1]code is set to codeu[N1]code so that the boundary terms dont change. The code performs this averaging a large number of times to get reasonable times for timing tests. On my hardware, the Thrust computation takes roughly twice as long as the naive code. Is there a way to improve my Thrust codep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltthrustdevicevector.hgt include ltboosttimer.hppgt include ltthrustdevicemalloc.hgt  typedef double numtype  template lttypename Tgt class NeighborAverageFunctor int N public NeighborAverageFunctorint N N  N  template lttypename Tuplegt host device void operatorTuple t T uL  thrustgetlt0gtt T uR  thrustgetlt1gtt  thrustgetlt2gtt  0.5uL  uR   int getN return N    template lttypename Tgt void thrustsweepthrustdeviceptrltTgt u, thrustdeviceptrltTgt uNew, NeighborAverageFunctorltTgtamp op int N  op.getN thrustforeachthrustmakezipiteratorthrustmaketupleu, u  2, uNew  1, thrustmakezipiteratorthrustmaketupleu  N, u  N2, uNew  N1, op  Propagate boundary values without changing them uNew[0]  u[0] uNew[N1]  u[N1]    template lttypename Tgt global void initializationkernelint n, T u const int i  blockIdx.x  blockDim.x  threadIdx.x ifi lt n2 ifi  0 u[i]  1.0  else u[i]  0.0     template lttypename Tgt global void sweepkernelint n, T, T u, T uNew const int i  blockDim.x  blockIdx.x  threadIdx.x if i gt 1 ampamp i lt n1 uNew[i]  0.5u[i1]  u[i1]  else ifi  0  i  n1 uNew[i]  u[i]    int mainvoid int sweeps  2000 int N  40962048 numtype h  1.0N numtype hSquared  powh, 2  NeighborAverageFunctorltnumtypegt opN  thrustdeviceptrltnumtypegt ud  thrustdevicemallocltnumtypegtN2 thrustdeviceptrltnumtypegt uNewd  thrustdevicemallocltnumtypegtN2 thrustdeviceptrltnumtypegt uTempd  thrustfillud, ud  N2, 0.0 ud[0]  1.0  boosttimertimer timer1  forint k  0 k lt sweeps k thrustsweepltnumtypegtud, uNewd, op uTempd  ud ud  uNewd uNewd  uTempd   double thrusttime  timer1.elapsed  thrusthostvectorltnumtypegt uhN2 thrustcopyud, ud  N2, uh.begin forint i  0 i lt 10 i stdcout ltlt uh[i] ltlt    stdcout ltlt stdendl  thrustdevicefreeud thrustdevicefreeuNewd  numtype  urawd,  uNewrawd,  uTemprawd cudaMallocampurawd, N2sizeofnumtype cudaMallocampuNewrawd, N2sizeofnumtype  numtype  urawh  numtypemallocN2sizeofnumtype  int blocksize  256 int gridsize  N2  blocksize  1  blocksize  initializationkernelltnumtypegtltltltgridsize, blocksizegtgtgtN, urawd  boosttimertimer timer2  forint k  0 k lt sweeps k sweepkernelltnumtypegtltltltgridsize, blocksizegtgtgtN2, hSquared, urawd, uNewrawd uTemprawd  urawd urawd  uNewrawd uNewrawd  uTemprawd   double rawtime  timer2.elapsed  cudaMemcpyurawh, urawd, N2sizeofnumtype, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost  forint i  0 i lt 10 i stdcout ltlt urawh[i] ltlt    stdcout ltlt stdendl  stdcout ltlt Thrust  ltlt thrusttime ltlt  s ltlt stdendl stdcout ltlt Raw  ltlt rawtime ltlt  s ltlt stdendl  freeurawh  cudaFreeurawd cudaFreeuNewrawd  return 0 codepre div div p

Negative 1694 pI have 4 variables, each in triplicates, and I need to find the average for each triplicate, in each row, and on top of that find minimum and maximum for each 5th row, in order to plot error bars. Here is an example with two variablesp  precode  x  a1  a2  a3  b1  b2  b3 220   2   7  71  28  53  31 221   5  13  85  33  51  34 codepre  pSo I need the average of a1a3 when x220, and so on, and then I need minimum and maximum for row 1, row 6 and so on. I assume I need to do this in order to get the data I need to make error bars, but I am new to R, so there might be a better way.p

Negative 1694 pOur team is working on a location based application android amp web in which employees provide services to people also termed as Lovedone. Employees have our app installed on their android phones which keeps updating their current location to web. Employee gets appointments and they visit the lovedones at specific times. Employee when reach the loved ones place, they, through the app, select Arrival option. When they are done with the lovedone, they selects Departure option. We found out that there are chances that employee can forget to select Departure option, therefore we have added a condition on web that when a lovedone is in arrival state and employee is found away at some threshold distance, we send him notification whether they forgot to Departure or its the part of their service. Then employe selects whatever the reason is.  At very first stage, we found out that if employe selects arrival outside of that threshold distance area, it would send them notification which we dont want, so we added a boolean which only gets true when employee enters the specified zone. Now when system gets employee location, first it checks whether the employee was able to get into the zone once, if yes then it checks if employee is out of the distance threshold. If we look it this way, it looks simple and correct but we are facing a big issue here. Let me explain that now......Although my question is getting longer and longer but I want to explain it well so that you experts have idea what is happening in system. while checking for in zone check, we are sending employee location as source and lovedone as destination but for outside zone check threshold check we have to set lovedone as source and employee as destination and I guess you all know why this is. Now let me tell you the real issue. In most of the cases, where there are separate roads for incoming and outgoing traffic, switching the source and destinations between in zone and outside check results in big differences in distances. Now as the employee enters the zone, enterzone is set to true and on  very next location update, it will send outside zone msg as the distance from lovedone to employee would be much greater than the threshold value. p  pWe are stuck here. Dont know how to resolve this issue. Can anybody suggest some workaround for this I have posted a rough sketch which may be helpful. p  pWe are using Google Distance Matrix API to calculate distances. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMDBrQ.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 1694 pi have a few divs on my index page, though i am having problems with sending form data i have in a div i am using for a suggestion box. p  pThe suggestion box by itself works fine, it sends the data to thankyou.php located in root directory which inserts the data in the database and displays a thank you message before it redirects back to the index page.

Negative 1694 pcodeAVPlayercode has a property called coderatecode that is meant to control the playback rate. code1.0code is normal speed while values like code2.0code or code5.0code should playback at 2x and 5x respectively. p  pWhenever I set a playback rate value higher than code1.0code say code10.0code, the playback is very choppy and it looks like a large number of frames are getting dropped as the player cant keep up. p  pHowever, the same values in QuickTime Player with the same movie, produce smooth playback for rates of code2x, 5x, 10x, 30x and 60xcode as reported by the QuickTime Player. p  pI created a test OS X application that contains nothing more than an codeAVPlayerViewcode and two buttons for setting the playback rate. A rate of code1.0code works as expected, but a rate of code10.0code produces very choppy playback. p  pHowever, the codeAVPlayerViewcode has an odd quirk in that if you mouseclick on the playback timeline to seek to another location while its playing at 10x and choppy, then the codeAVPlayerViewcode will fix the playback and the movie will be played smoothly at 10x. All it took was clicking on the playback timeline. p  pDoes anyone know how to get smooth playback for rates other than 1x Its obviously not a hardware problem or a file size problem because both QuickTime Player and AVPlayerView can do it. p  pstrongAttemptsstrongp  pThis a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6630356questiona suggests that it might be an audio issue and indeed both QuickTime Player and AVPlayerView mute the audio when forwarding but all attempts on my part to either disable all audio tracks, mute all tracks or change the audio pitch algorithm did not seem to make a difference. Playback was still choppy even when there was no audio present. p  pIve also tried stopping playback and then calling codeprerollAtRatecompletionHandlercode with the new rate but that doesnt make a difference either. p  pWhat is it that QuickTime Player and AVPlayerView are doing that allows for smooth movie playback at rates of 10x, 30x or even 60x p

Negative 1694 pIve been using dplyr for a bit locally and Ive found it a very powerful tool. One thing that gets showcased in a lot of the intro talks Ive found is how you can use it to operate on a database table to only work with the data you want via its aggregation functions, codesummarizecode, codemutatecode, etc. I understand how it translates those into sql statements, but not so much other operations.p  pFor example, if I wanted to work on a database table as a codetblcode, and I wanted to run a function on the result of my pipeline through codedocode, such as codeglmcode, would codeglmcode be transported to the database somehow to be run there, or is the data necessarily downloaded in whatever reduced form and then codeglmcode is run locally p  pDepending on the size of the table in question, this is an important distinction. Thanksp

Negative 1694 pHow do you get around the scenario where the TestFixture you are trying to define needs to reference types that do not have a noarg constructorp  pIm trying to test an interface that has multiple implementations. From the NUnit documentation it showed how this could be setup with generics like this where I can define multiple implementation typesp  precode[TestFixturetypeofImpl1MyInterface] [TestFixturetypeofImpl2MyInterface] [TestFixturetypeofImpl3MyInterface] public class TesterOfIMyInterfaceltTgt where T  IMyInterface, new       public IMyInterface impl      [SetUp]     public void CreateIMyInterfaceImpl          impl  new T       codepre  pThe problem arises because Impl1MyInterface, Impl2MyInterface, etc do not have noarg constructors so when NUnit tries to discover the available test cases I get this error and the tests do not show up in VSp  blockquote   pException System.ArgumentException, Exception thrown discovering tests   in XYZ.dllp blockquote  pIs there a way to work around this It doesnt make sense to define noarg constructors because my code needs those values to work.p

I have since updated my database again and republished to find the same result.p  pstrongThe last changes I made to the databasestrong were to add some custom user permissions to one of my database entities. The definitions of these UserPermissions can be seen in my previous post here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30756374settingdefaultvaluesforcomplexpropertiesbackfillingdatabasenoredirect1comment4956734830756374Setting default values for Complex Properties  Backfilling databasea p  pWhen updating the database I got a warningp  blockquote   pThe value of the complex property Permissions on entity of type Organisation is null.

Negative 1694 pIve been working on an animatronic shooting gallery using a Raspberry Pi B and an Arduino Mega. Overall, things are going well except for one detail. Im having trouble keeping the motor movements in sync with sound. p  pFor example, say I got this talking pig. You hit the target and the pig says Hey, Kid Watch were youre pointing that thing Youll put your eye out or something like that. Problem is, the motors making the pig move cant keep up with the audio. They lag behind, getting out of sync with the audio. The longer the routine, the further they fall behind. Whats more, it doesnt lag behind at a consistent rate. It seems to depend on what else the computer is doing at the time. For example, I had Audacity running at the same time as my program was running, and there was noticeably more lag then when my program was the only program running. I also notice a slight difference in lag between running my program in IDLE vs running from terminal.p  pSome of my targets are more sensitive to synchronization than others, for example, if I had a rocket that went up to a whooshing sound, its not really an issue if the motor moves a little faster or slower, but mouth movements look terrible if theyre off by more than maybe a tenth of a second.p  pTo control my motors, I use a pickled list of tuples each containing 0 time in ms after beginning of routine for the position signal to be sent, 1 the number of the motor for the signal to be sent to, and 2 the position of the motor. The main program loops through all the targets and gives each a chance to see if it is time for it to send the next motor position command.p  pHere is my current codep  precodeimport time import pygame.mixer import os import cPickle as pickle import RPi.GPIO as GPIO from AdafruitPWMServoDriver import PWM  GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BOARD chanlist  [17,18] GPIO.setupchanlist, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP GPIO.addeventdetect17, GPIO.FALLING GPIO.addeventdetect18, GPIO.FALLING   pygame.mixer.initchannels1, frequency22050 pygame.mixer.setnumchannels10 pwm  PWM0x40 pwm.setPWMFreq60  gameon  1  class Bot     def initself, folder, servopins          self.startExecute  0         self.finishExecute  0          self.folder  folder  name of folder containing routine sound and motor position data         self.servoPins  servopins list of servo motor pins for this bot         self.IRpin  IRpin         self.startTime  0  start time of curent routine in ms. begins at 0ms         self.counter  0 next frame of routine to be executed         self.isRunning  0 1 if bot is running a a routine 0 if not target inactive if 1         self.routine  0  position of current routine in self.routines         self.numRoutines  0          self.sounds  [] list containing sound objects for routines.

The arduino is connected to a couple of potentiometers connected to 5V and ground, with the signal voltage coming from the middle terminal into an analog input. The arduino converts this analog value to a motor position in degrees, and sends that over the serial port to the PC that saves it in a tuple along with the motor number, and time that the byte was received, appends the tuple to a list, then at the end of the program, saves it in a pkl file. I will provide that code if somebody really wants to see it, but I dont believe the problem lies within the data produced by this process.p  pIf you have any suggestions about how I could fix this code to make it work, that would be the preferable solution, because the solution Im contemplating now seems like it might just be one massive PITA.p  pIm thinking that I could use one audio channel say, the left channel for my audio, then in the other channel, I could have sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes with each frequency being assigned to a specific motor. Say for example I have this one motor that moves a mouth. This motor will have an assigned frequency of 1000 Hz. Whenever the mouth needs to be open, there will be a 1000 Hz sine wave in the motor control channel. I would use an Arduino Mega to detect that sine wave, and send the PWM signal to the motor to move to a certain position. The position emmayem even be determined by the amplitude of the sine wave. To make things a little simpler, I could just have 3 positions for the mouth, closed no signal, open a little small amplitude signal, and open a little more larger amplitude signal.p  pAll of this would be done using this FFT library a hrefhttpwiki.openmusiclabs.comwikiArduinoFFT relnofollowhttpwiki.openmusiclabs.comwikiArduinoFFTap  pI would need to build a circuit to convert the AC signal from the RPi to a 05V signal. I have found this circuit a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comcQ68q.png relnofollowherea that looks like it plausibly might work, assuming I can find a way to cleanly amplify the signal from the RPi to  2.5V. a hrefhttpelectronics.stackexchange.comquestions148085fftbeatdetectioncircuitSourceap  pOther than that, I dont know how difficult or effective it would be to implement this solution. For one, Im not sure if I can send PWM signals to the motors and run the FFT library at the same time, and Ive never worked with this library, or had any experience with FFT at all.p  pMy fallback solution is to design the shooting gallery so that it is less dependent on synchronization. This would involve such compromises such as just making the mouth open and close at a steady rate rather than trying to make it move in sync with audio, and keeping triggered routines short lt 5 secondsp  pOkay, problem defined, now on to specific questionsp  pWhat can I do to make the current version of the program work without having to resort to analyzing a bunch of sine waves using FFTp  pFailing that, any suggestions on the input circuit What could I use to cleanly amplify the RPi signal to  2.5V, and will the circuit I linked to actually work to convert that signal to a 0V5V signal readable by an Arduino analog inputp  pWill using the FFT library interfere with sending the PWM signals to the motorsp  pHow much of a PITA will it be to extract usable data from a bunch of sine waves using FFTp  pThe documentation for the FFT library is a little lacking, How do I set the range of frequencies to analyze I see that it starts at 0 HzDC, but whats the high end Can I set that I only need maybe 30 usable bins. What frequencies should I use to get the clearest signals Im guessing I dont want to use the highest and lowest, because the lowest would take longer to detect, and the highest will be more distorted due to the poor quality of the audio coming out of the RPi. Should I set it to 64 bins and use the middle 30 And again, how do I determine the center frequency of each binp

But as shown in the earlier output 2  block other THREAD follows 3 block other THREAD statement at strongPoint firststrong .This shows that the dispatchsync function didnt make the queue wait. How is that possible .Please ask me any another other infomration if needed.p  pstrongEDIT 1 strong I am putting the text of the well known book here to explain my point . The book is iOS 7 Programming cookbook. Text follows For any task that doesnt involve the UI, you can use global concurrent queues in GCD. These allow either synchronous or asynchronous execution. But synchronous execution does not mean your program waits for the code to finish before continuing. strongIt simply means that the concurrent queue will wait until your task has finished before it continues to the next block of code on the queue. When you put a block object on a concurrent queue, your own program always continues right away without waiting for the queue to execute the code.strong This is because concurrent queues, as their name implies, run their code on threads other than the main thread.p  pAs the bold text says that the concurrent queue would wait UNTIL my task is finished before continuing with the next block. My block printing 2  block other THREAD should be allowed to finish before 3 block other THREAD starts, but that is not the case my  2 block other THREAD is printed again intermingling with 3 block other THREAD statement when in fact my all 2 block other THREAD should be allowed to get completed and then 3 block other THREAD should follow.

Negative 1694 pI understand that attempting to link objectslibraries that were compiled with different Visual C toolset versions will result in failure as was described here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19575747errorlnk2038mismatchdetectedformscvervalue1600doesntmatchvaluerror LNK2038 mismatch detected for 39MSCVER39 value 39160039 doesn39t match value 39170039 in CppFile1.obja.p  pHowever, when working with the 2010 DirectX SDK there is seemingly no problem with linking to these old libraries eg. d3d11.lib, etc. even if we use VC121315. p  pWhy is it that we can link to these old DirectX libraries but not ones created by earlier versions of VC. Also, if not VC, what was used to compile these DirectX libraries in the first placep
Negative 1694 pI have the following Problem I have a codeListviewcode, where each item is a custom Control DisruptionIcon, that shows an Icon, depending on the properties that are set for the custom Control. The Icon can have one shape out of many here in the example just None and Square. The Problem is now, if I scroll down in the codeListViewcode and after that back up, the Icons are wrong.

If I replace the codeListViewcode with an codeItemsControlcode wraped in a codeScrollViewercode, the Problem does not exists, but is uses much more Memory and needs more time to load. Additionally if you uncomment the codeTextBlockcode, that is added as a comment in the codeMainPage.xamlcode, you see in every line the correct ID, but the wrong Image as shown in the screenhots.p  pstrongEditstrong If I place any Control in a codeScrollViewercode, then it is slow, but works. It also works, if I put the whole Code of the DisruptionIcon.xaml directly to the place in the MainPage, where the DirutpionIcon is referenced.p
Negative 1694 pI am looking for a methodology of how to deploy applications, websites and web services from codeDEVcode to codeITGcode and codePROcode. I am not referring only to files included in the projects, but also settings from codeIIScode, filesfolders permissions, etc.p  pFor example, this weekend we had to deploy a new application from codeITGcode to codePROcode, and codePRO AppPoolcode was set to run code.NET 2.0code from previous version. It took us sometime to realize what was going on, leading of course to a longer downtime than expected.p  pCurrently we are using codeVS 2013code, codeC 4.xcode, codeIIS 8.xcode and codeTFS 2013code. The question here is, if there is a way to deploy an application with a single click. Is codeMSBuildcode suitable for this task I have no experience on codeMSBuildcode, I just found some stuff while Googling, and I am wondering if I need to go deeper. Can TFS read those settings from the source machine and copy them on the target somehow Is there any other tool than can complete this task We would like to stay inside Microsofts circle, however if something else does exactly that, we might consider it.p

Negative 1694 pIm developing a simple event driven application in C11 based on the publishsubscribe pattern. Classes have one or more codeonWhateverEventcode method invoked by the event loop inversion of control. Since the application is in fact a firmware, where code size is critical and flexibility is not of high priority, the subscribe part is a simple table with event ids and associated handlers.p  pHeres a very simplified code of the ideap  precodeinclude ltfunctionalgt  enum Events      EVTIMERTICK,     EVBUTTONPRESSED   struct Button      void onTickint event   publish EVBUTTONPRESSED     struct Menu      void onButtonPressedint event   publish EVSOMETHINGELSE     Button button1 Button button2 Menu mainMenu  stdpairltint, stdfunctionltvoidintgtgt dispatchTable[]       EVTIMERTICK, stdbindampButtononTick, ampbutton1, stdplaceholders1 ,     EVTIMERTICK, stdbindampButtononTick, ampbutton2, stdplaceholders1 ,     EVBUTTONPRESSED, stdbindampMenuonButtonPressed, ampmainMenu, stdplaceholders1    int mainvoid       while1          int event  EVTIMERTICK  msgQueue.getEventBlocking         for autoamp a  dispatchTable              if event  a.first                  a.secondevent                codepre  pThis compiles and runs fine with a desktop compiler, and codestdfunctionltvoidintgtgt fn  stdbindampSomeClassonSomething, ampsomeInstance, stdplaceholders1code elegantly implements type erasure so the event dispatch table can hold handlers of different classes, thus different types.p  pThe problem comes with the embedded compiler AVRGCC 4.8.3 which supports C11, but theres no Standard C Library no codeltfunctionalgtcode header. I was thinking how can I recreate the above behavior with compiler features only. I evaluated a few options, but there are objections for each by the compiler or mep  ol lipCreate an interface with a codevirtual void HandleronEventint eventcode method, and derive codeButtoncode and codeMenucode from it. The dispatch table can hold interface pointers, and virtual method calls do the rest. This is the most simple approach but I dont like the idea of limiting the number of event handler methods to one per class with doing local ifelse event dispatch, and having the overhead of a virtual method call per event.pli lipMy second idea still contains a virtual method call, but has no restrictions on the codeButtoncode and codeMenucode class. Its a virtual method call based typeerasure with functorsp  precodestruct FunctBase      virtual void operatorint event  0   templatelttypename Tgt struct Funct  public FunctBase      T pobj                 instance ptr     void Tpmfnint    mem fun ptr     FunctT pobj, void Tpmfnint  pobjpobj, pmfnpmfn       void operatorint ev override          pobjgtpmfnev       codepre  pcodeFunctcode can hold instance and method pointers, and the dispatch table can be constructed of codeFunctBasecode pointers. This way table is as flexible as with functionbind can hold any class type and any number of handlers per class. My only problem that it still contains 1 virtual method call per event, its just moved to the functor.pli lipMy third idea is a simple hack converting method pointers to function pointersp  precodetypedef void Pfnvoid, int Pfn pfn1  reinterpretcastltPfngtampButtononTick Pfn pfn2  reinterpretcastltPfngtampMenuonButtonPressed codepre  pAs far as I know this is Undefined Behavior and indeed makes the compiler emit a big fat warning. Its based on the assumption that c methods have an implicit 1st argument pointing to codethiscode. Nonetheless it works, its lightweight no virtual calls, and its flexible.pli ol  pSo my question Is it possible to do something like option 3 in clean C way I know theres a void based typeerasure technique opposed to virtual method call in option 2, but I dont know how to implement it. Looking at desktop version with stdbind also gives me the impression that it binds the first implicit argument to be the instance pointer, but maybe thats just the syntax.p

Instead of it calling to get default data, I want to define it to get my custom data... So in my case, I want to define a method getDevice that puts that data in the database column DEVICE. My database table will not be for logging logger messages, it will be for logging a device and its value and timestamp to later present to a trending graph.p  pI hope this makes some sense...p

Negative 1694 pIve been reading some links and posts regarding using parent and child codeNSManagedObjectContextcode in codeCore Datacode, but the example scenarios Ive found deal with simply editing the attributes of a certain object in the parent context, and then pushing changes to the parent context.p  pThe scenario I need to handle is a bit complex and Im not sure how to manage itp  pI have a set of managed objects in the default context the one that is provided in codeAppDelegatecode in the main queue. My app periodically call web services to check if there are updates for those objects. I want to do perform these updates in a separated thread to avoid blocking de UI, so, when its time to call de services to ask for updates, I do thisp  precode    let bundle  NSBundle.mainBundle     let modelURL  bundle.URLForResourceMyApp, withExtension momd     let model  NSManagedObjectModelcontentsOfURL modelURL      let psc  NSPersistentStoreCoordinatormanagedObjectModel model      let privateContext  NSManagedObjectContextconcurrencyType NSManagedObjectContextConcurrencyType.PrivateQueueConcurrencyType     privateContext.persistentStoreCoordinator  psc      let documentsURL  CoreDataHelper.applicationDocumentsDirectory     let storeURL  documentsURL.URLByAppendingPathComponentMyApp.sqlite      let options  [NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption true]      var error NSError  nil     let store NSPersistentStore  psc.addPersistentStoreWithTypeNSSQLiteStoreType, configuration nil, URL storeURL, options options, error amperror codepre  pThat is, I create a new context in a private queue and with its own new persistent store coordinator and persistent store.p  pOnce I have my private context, I request the updates to servicesp  precode[privateContext performBlockAndWait           Call services          Create new objects in this private context with          the data in services responses     ] codepre  pEverything ok at this point. I have an old set of objects in my main context, and a new set of objects in the private context.

Here it is not the user who edits the objects, so I need to avoid blocking the UI, and furthermore Im not just modifying objects information, but deleting and adding new objects if needed.p  pI have some questions regarding parentchild contextsp  ol liCan a child context be in a private queue and the parent context in the main queueli liIve read somewhere something about setting a merge policy, but I didnt find examples of its use, maybe is not necessary to set a merge policy when usen parentchild contexts When would they be set Where can I find an example or tutorialli liIf I set my private context as child of the main context, and I save the child private context, will the objects in private context replace the objects in the main context as I want including deleting the objects that are no longer present in the private context and the new ones... I mean... does the whole child context replace the whole parent contextli liWould it be better to save the private context without being a child of the main one, and then clearing and refetching all the new data in the main contextli ol  pI need help to understand how this works and which is the best way to manage my scenario.p  pThanks in advance.p  pList itemp

Negative 1694 pOk so this has been a tough one, I have been researching and trying to butcher previous codes together to get this to work but the last time I truly did any code was PASCAL...so here it goes, I have reports ran daily in the morning, the reports from the previous day are still in the root directory source. So I need to grab only the newest files and move them from sourcecreports to targetcreports2 . While moving these files I need to remove the date tag at the end of each of the filenames ex ReportMMDDYYYY.example PresentationMMDDYYYY.example etc. etc. to just Report.example Presentation.example. I am trying to make this an daily automated process..I would greatly appreciate any help with this. Thanks ahead of timep

Negative 1694 pI want to sort some numberstring combination but the sorting will be based on the number from that combination. Can you suggest an optimal solutionp  pSay my strings are br12 Masdf br4 Oasd br44 Twer brand so on. The sorting will be based on the numbers like 12, 4, 44 and after the sorting I have to show the full alphanumeric strings.p  pAs the program will run on thousands of data I dont want to split the string and compare the number on each iteration. My plan is to extract the numbers and take those in an array and then sort the array. After sorting done, I want to put back the numbers with associated strings and keep those in a string array to show. It should be done in C. Algorithms should be applied  Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, etc.p

The same certificates that work on my website.p  pPostfix main.cfp  precodesmtpdbanner  myhostname ESMTP mailname DebianGNU biff  no  appenddotmydomain  no  readmedirectory  no  smtpdtlscertfileetcpostfixSSLprivates.cert smtpdtlskeyfileetcpostfixSSLprivate.key smtpdtlsCAfileetcpostfixSSLprivateRoot.cert smtpdusetlsyes smtpdtlsauthonly  yes smtpdtlsloglevel  3  smtpsaslauthenableyes smtpsaslpasswordmapshashetcpostfixmysqlvirtualmailboxmaps.cf smtpsaslmechanismfilter  digestmd5 smtpsaslsecurityoptions  smtpdsasltype  dovecot smtpdsaslpath  privateauth smtpdsaslauthenable  yes  smtphostlookup  native  smtpdrecipientrestrictions          permitsaslauthenticated,         permitmynetworks,         rejectunauthdestination        rejectunknownreverseclienthostname  myhostname  Harry aliasmaps  hashetcaliases aliasdatabase  hashetcaliases myorigin  etcmailname mydestination  example.nl, Harry, localhost.localdomain, localhost, mydestination  localhost, 127.0.0.1 relayhost   mynetworks  127.0.0.08, x.x.x.x mailboxsizelimit  0 recipientdelimiter   inetinterfaces  all inetprotocols  ipv4  virtualtransport  lmtpunixprivatedovecotlmtp  virtualmailboxdomains  mysqletcpostfixmysqlvirtualmailboxdomains.cf virtualmailboxmaps  mysqletcpostfixmysqlvirtualmailboxmaps.cf virtualaliasmaps  mysqletcpostfixmysqlvirtualaliasmaps.cf codepre  pPostfix master.cfp  precode copy made in smae folder for backup .orig    service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command  args                yes   yes   yes   never 100   smtp      inet  n                                   smtpd submission inet n                                   smtpd   o syslognamepostfixsubmission   o smtpdtlssecuritylevelencrypt   o smtpdsaslauthenableyes   o smtpdclientrestrictionspermitsaslauthenticated,reject   o miltermacrodaemonnameORIGINATING smtps     inet  n                                   smtpd   o syslognamepostfixsmtps   o smtpdtlswrappermodeyes   o smtpdsaslauthenableyes   o smtpdclientrestrictionspermitsaslauthenticated,reject   o miltermacrodaemonnameORIGINATING pickup    fifo  n                     60      1       pickup cleanup   unix  n                            0       cleanup qmgr      fifo  n              n       300     1       qmgr tlsmgr    unix                       1000   1       tlsmgr rewrite   unix                                     trivialrewrite bounce    unix                              0       bounce defer     unix                              0       bounce trace     unix                              0       bounce verify    unix                              1       verify flush     unix  n                     1000   0       flush proxymap  unix                n                     proxymap proxywrite unix               n              1       proxymap smtp      unix                                     smtp relay     unix                                     smtp showq     unix  n                                   showq error     unix                                     error retry     unix                                     error discard   unix                                     discard local     unix         n       n                     local virtual   unix         n       n                     virtual lmtp      unix                                     lmtp anvil     unix                              1       anvil scache    unix                              1       scache maildrop  unix         n       n                     pipe   flagsDRhu uservmail argvusrbinmaildrop d recipient uucp      unix         n       n                     pipe   flagsFqhu useruucp argvuux r n z asender  nexthoprmail recipient ifmail    unix         n       n                     pipe   flagsF userftn argvusrlibifmailifmail r nexthop recipient bsmtp     unix         n       n                     pipe   flagsFq. userbsmtp argvusrlibbsmtpbsmtp tnexthop fsender recipient scalemailbackend unix         n       n              2       pipe   flagsR userscalemail argvusrlibscalemailbinscalemailstore nexthop user extension mailman   unix         n       n                     pipe   flagsFR userlist argvusrlibmailmanbinpostfixtomailman.py   nexthop user codepre  pOutlook works fine and the SSL is accepted but with Postman Wordpressp  precodeSSLacceptSSLv3 flush data Oct  2 075213 Harry postfixsmtpssmtpd[23113] read from B80F69D0 [B80FBFC3] 5 bytes gt 5 0x5 Oct  2 075213 Harry postfixsmtpssmtpd[23113] 0000 15 03 03 00 02                                   .....

Negative 1694 pI currently have an array looking like thisp  precodeArray      [7] gt Array                      [49] gt              [41] gt                [8] gt Array                      [70] gt              [69] gt                [105] gt      [9] gt      [10] gt   codepre  pNow, I need each to work with each key, but I struggle getting those through a foreach loop, because there is no values. I have been trying to use arraykeys, but that disregards multidimensional keys. Is there a way I can assign the keys as the values as well, to have a structure like thisp  precodeArray      [7] gt Array                      [49] gt 49             [41] gt 41               [8] gt Array                      [70] gt 70             [69] gt 69               [105] gt 105     [9] gt 9     [10] gt 10  codepre  pThis way I could use a foreach to get the values of each key. I dont know if this is the easiest way, but I would love to get some hints into the right direction. Thanksp
Negative 1694 pI use actually SQLserver to store transactionnal data. We need now use a milions rows of historical data tick data in milisecond for 1000 stocksp  pSQL Server isnt design for this. I have tick data in CSV format, but I cant stay with this format. I need compute VWAP, Participation, TWAP, Price, SMA, RSI, ... and a lot of others indicator.p  pAfter this I need do a backtest on this data.p  pIm not interrested by real time storage, only fast accessreadcompute.p  pAll application is in .NET.p  pKDB is free in 32bit, InfluxDB, TeaFilesHDF5, MongoDB, ..., others p  pThanks for your helpp
