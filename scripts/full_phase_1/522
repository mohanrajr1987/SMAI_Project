Positive 522 pI have an Excel 2010 data file with over 200 variables columns, and over 1,000 records rows, each identified with a unique id number.

Therefore, I need to produce a matrix that will show me the numberpercent of same values between each record and all other records e.g., record 1 and record 2 share 75 equal values, record 1 and record 3 share 57 equal values, record 2 and record 3 share 45 equal values, etc..  I have a few workarounds, but they take hours and dont produce a simple matrix.  I dont care about the difference between the values  just whether they are equal or not.

Positive 522 pI have worked on several projects now where I have been stumped by MS Excel and MS Access where I cannot use VBA to manipulate objects whilst in design view. They are very simple tasks such as changing the name of the labels on a userform in MS Excel or adding new textboxes to a report in MS Access but they seem to be impossible as any macro will only be used upon activation of said userform or report and so everything is just done in runtime.p  pTo focus on one, In MS Excel I want to be able to run a code which will go through all the labels on my userform and rename them from Label1, Label2, etc... to Lbl1, Lbl2, etc... for instance but I cannot just click a button to run a macro on the design of the userform which would run through all the labels and change their names. If I am able to do this then I can be much more efficent with the rest of my runtime code. Without it, I have the option of renaming every single label I have but there are near 100 labels and I want to do this through VBA as I already can see that it would be very useful to know how to run code in design view of these Visual Basic elements.p  pPlease could you advise whether it is possible to manipulate these VB objects in design viewp

Negative 522 pIm writing a .NET web application in which administrators can customize the various data entry forms presented to their users.  There are about half a dozen different field types that admins can create and customize i.e. text, numeric, dropdown, file upload.  All fields share a set of base attributesbehaviors is the field required Will it have a default field value.  There are also a series of field specific attributesbehaviors i.e dropdown has a data source attribute, but text field does not.   Im leaving out many other characteristics of the problem domain for simplicitys sake. p  pThe class hierarchy is straightforward An abstract superclass that encapsulates common behaviorsattributes and about half a dozen concrete subclasses that deal with field specific stuff.p  pEach field type is rendered i.e. mapped to as a specific type of .NET server control, all of which derive from System.Web.UI.Control.  p  pI created the following code to map values between the field domain objects and their corresponding UI controlp  precodepublic static void BindControl control, IListltDocumentFieldBasegt fieldBaseList       foreach DocumentFieldBase fieldBase in fields              if typeof DocumentFieldText.IsInstanceOfTypefieldBase                 TextBox textbox  TextBox control                 textbox.Text  fieldBase as DocumentFieldText.GetValue                           if typeof DocumentFieldDropDown.IsInstanceOfTypefieldBase                 DropDown dropDown DropDown control                 dropDown.Text  fieldBase as DocumentFieldSelectOne.GetValue.Text                 dropDown.DataSource fieldBase as  DocumentFieldSelectOne.DataSource                 dropDown.Id fieldBase as DocumentFieldSelectOne.GetValue.Id                           more if statements left out for brevity         codepre  pI want to ditch those ungodly if statements that perform type checking.  The approach I was shooting for was to create a method overload for each combination of fieldcontrol using subclass typing. For examplep  precodepublic static void BindTextBox control, DocumentFieldText fieldText  some implementation code  public static void BindDropDown control, DocumentFieldDropDown fieldDropDown  some implementation code  codepre  pI was hoping that I could then rely on .NET to call the appropriate overload at strongruntimestrong using the specific subclass being used  For examplep  precodeforeach DocumentFieldBase field in fields   Control control  FindControlfield.Identifier   Bindcontrol, field  codepre  pUnfortunately, the compiler chokes when I try this     Argument 1 cannot convert from System.Web.UI.Control to TextBox.p  pIf I have to cast the first argument to TextBox, Im back to performing type checking myself and defeats the whole purpose of this exercise.p  pIs what Im trying to achieve a possible and b a good ideap

Negative 522 pIm trying to find an efficient deterministic way of allocating a 32bit handle in such a way that it will operate indefinitely. A simple incrementing counter will not work because it will eventually loop around.

Though itll end up in an SQLite database I cant just brute force test each key after loop around for example...p  pI think what I need is some sort of range tree that knows about all previously allocated handles populating this on start up is fine.

Thanks.p  pAs David pointed out in his answer the syntax isp  precodeselect   from loan cross join borrower codepre  pEven though I was not aware of the above syntax I still think its inconsistent. Having the cross join keyword in addition to allowing inner join without a join condition would be fine. A cross join is in fact an inner join without a join condition, why not express it as an inner join without the join condition p

It looks like the most basic example code.p  pIs is possible that the cells are not instantiated with the nib file I have them on the same level before the tabula view in the nib file. I tried to move them after the table view, but it did not make any difference.p  pAre table cells in some way special Do I need to set some flag or some property on them in the nib file I was under the impression that all classes views, windows, controllers  listed in a nib file are simply instantiated and linked using the provided connections.p  pCould it possibly be some memory issue The cell properties in my controller are not defined in any special way.p

Negative 522 pIm working on a framework that Im trying to type as strongly as I possibly can.  Im working within PHP and taking some of the ideas that I like from C and trying to utilize them within this framework.  Im creating a Collection class that is a collection of domain entitiesobjects.  Its kinda modeled after the codeListltTgtcode object in .Net.p  pIve run into an obstacle that is preventing me from typing this class.  If I have a UserCollection, it should only allow User objects into it.  If I have a PostCollection, it should only allow Post objects.p  pAll Collections in this framework need to have certain basic functions, such as add, remove, iterate.  I created an interface, but found that I couldnt do the followingp  precodeinterface ICollection  public function addobj  class PostCollection implements ICollection  public function addPost obj   codepre  pThis broke its compliance with the interface.  But I cant have the interface strongly typed because then all Collections are of the same type.  So I attempted the followingp  precodeinterface ICollection  public function addobj  abstract class Collection implements ICollection  const type  null  class PostCollection extends Collection   const type  Post  public function addobj    ifobj instanceof selftype     throw new UhOhException       codepre  pWhen I attempt to run this code, I get codesyntax error, unexpected TSTRING, expecting TVARIABLE or code on the codeinstanceofcode statement.  A little research into the issue and it looks like the root of the cause is that codeobj instanceof selfcode is valid to test against the class.  It appears that PHP doesnt process the entire codeselftypecode constant statement in the expression.  Adding parentheses around the codeselftypecode variable threw an error regarding an unexpected .p  pAn obvious workaround is to not make the codetypecode variable a constant.  The expression codeobj instanceof thisgttypecode works just fine if codetypecode is declared as a variable, of course.p  pIm hoping that theres a way to avoid that, as Id like to define the value as a constant to avoid any possible change in the variable later.  Any thoughts on how I can achieve this, or have I take PHP to its limit in this regard  Is there a way of escaping or encapsulating codeselfthiscode so that PHP wont die when processing itp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Based on the feedback below, I thought of something to try  the code below works  Can anyone think of 1 a reason not to do this, 2 a reason this wont ultimately work, or 3 a better way to pull this offp  precodeinterface ICollection  public function addobj  abstract class Collection  const type  null protected type  selftype  class PostCollection extends Collection   const type  Post  public function addobj    ifobj instanceof thisgttype     throw new UhOhException       codepre  pstrongUPDATE 2strong After putting the code above into production, it turns out it doesnt work.  I have no idea how it worked when I tested it, but it doesnt work at all.  Im stuck with using a codeprotectedcode variable, I think.p

Negative 522 pi was wondering if anyone knows how yelp determines what restaurants are open now im developing a similar application using htmljavascriptphp. i was going to have a column in my database for each day, with comma separated hours written in 2243 format 1043 pm. so for example if a restaurant is open for lunch and dinner it might be 1100,1400,1700,2200. then id check using js if the current time falls in one of the ranges for the current day. id also like to be able to determine if a restaurant is open tonight, open late, etc. for those i guess id check whether the open range overlaps with certain ranges.p  pis there a better way to do this particularly, how to store the hours in the database and then determine if they overlap with a given set of hours.p  pthanks.p

Only problem now is that I cant figure out how to pass the credentials to my web service now that it is in its own jar. Before I had access to a menu to set up the TokenGenerator and CallbackHandler. Now, I dont have access to those menus as the client is not in the dynamic web project. So now I have a disconnect and it of course fails when trying to run it on the server.p  pThere has to be a way to do this. I should be able to generate a client jar and pass it what it needs.

Negative 522 pIm trying to debug a webapp using Apache Camel from Eclipse and while Im tracing into I arrive at a point where Eclipse says that no source file is available and I can see bytecode shown in Eclipse where usually I see sourcecode but apparently I cannot advance into that bytecode I try F6  Step Over but nothing happens anyway not that it would have been that useful compared to source code.p  pSo how are you supposed to trace into such a beastp  pIm wondering if all these codegeneratingcodeintercepting layers arent creating more problems than theyre trying to solve.

I just want to trace a program that is using Apache Camel and I realize that things quickly gets very messy basically you kinda lose your tracing ability because you jump from your Java source code to something.  p
Negative 522 pSo my most basic question here is stronghow do you build TCP interfaces into your Java EE applicationsstrong Instead of interacting with a legacy EIS, I need to interact with a block of TCPIP ports. Ideally, Id like a messagedriven bean to have its onMessage method invoked by an incoming TCP request and also be able to respond back over the same connection.p  pJCA seems general enough to be capable of something like this within a Java EE environment. Would developing a custom connector be the appropriate technique for integrating inboundoutbound TCP interfaces in a Java enterprise ecosystemp  hr  pAs far as what Ive tried so far were currently utilizing a lifecycle module which starts by kicking off a number of TCP listeners this invokes a messagedriven bean which calls a business method, and it all returns over the same TCP stream. This is actually working alright, but the lifecycle support in my application server Glassfish feels like it has been added as an afterthought. So, JCA seems like a firstclass solution to this sort of problem and it seems to enable us to communicate over TCP.p  pHowever, from the initial research weve conducted, it does seem like the connector architecture is targeted towards legacy information systems, not generalized TCP communication. So, my question could be rendered are people using custom JCAs to integrate TCPIP into their Java EE applications  or is there a better technique for accepting TCP connections from my EJBsp

Negative 522 pI have a table with 8 columns. And the 3rd and 4th columns may have very long texts in it. This situation creates a horizontal scroll. What I want is that I want every column to have a fixed size. And I dont want the text inside columns to be wrapped and also dont want to have scroll bar. So if a column has a very long string for example abcdefghijklmnop it should show as much as possible without wrapping and without creating a scroll. So the text seen on the table may be somethintg like abcdefgp  pActually I am triyng to do this in Eclipse BIRT. But it would be adequate if I can learn how to make this in html and css. Than I can adopt it to BIRT. By the way I dont want to check the size of the text with javascript.p

Presumably clicking it again will hide it. However, when the event that gives the clicked div its new class categoryact, the function to hide it is also triggered. The result of course is that the first click, to show the submenu, appears to do nothing. Of course we know its actually firing the other one.p  pCan someone tell me why its triggering the hide functionality, and a possible way to fix it Or damn, a way to write this simpler. Theres a lot of addremoveClass going on.  p  pThanks. p

Negative 522 pI have a search in solr that is returning about 1500 documents. These documents are basically products. For example, I have a bunch of womens shoes in my dataset. My dataset has a wide variety of shoes for women, but it also has some very similar results, for instance, size 11 womens nike trainers, size 10 womens nike trainers, etc... Now, when I search for womens shoes, solr scoring causes a certain set of these results to bubble to the top that are all very similar.. For instance, all the colors of one particular shoe model might come to the top. They are definitely different products, but I would prefer to get a wider variety of results than just every color of nike trainer shoes.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions Note, I dont want to eliminate all the individually colored products. When someone searches for blue womens nike trainers, I want them to get the blue model as the top result. Im using the dismax query as my main query. What I would like to do is basically boost on some kind of uniqueness of name compared to other results factor. p

Negative 522 pI created a some javascriptjquery code to filter an html table.  The filter works by assigning two classes to the rows show and hide depending on the value of certain cells and then using CSS to hide the rows with the hide class.  The filter works perfectly.  However, when I apply the filter, somehow the table row height keeps changing usually the height increases significantly   2 or 3 times the desired height.  I have no idea why this is happening. My code is a few hundred lines so I dont think it would be worth pasting here.  And I have no idea which sections of my code are causing the problem or whether the issue is with the javascriptjquery or external css file.p  pCan anyone offer some suggestions for how I can best debug this problemp  pEDIT In addition to the row height increasing the main problem, the column width also shrinks a little when the filter is applied.p  pUPDATE I solved the problem at least for the changing row heights. It was related to a CSS setting where I set the height of the table body.  Thanks to the suggestions below, I used Firebug to inspect everything more closely.  I found a feature in Firebug that allows you to turn onoff CSS properties, as well as delete DOM elements.  By using those features, I was able to isolate the on CSS property that was causing the problems.  Thanks for the input everyone.p

Negative 522 pIm working with an application that uses JBPM 3.1 and MySQL.  The core problem is that there are processes instances with variables that contain an older version of an external, nonJBPM codeSerializablecode class.  When the main application is upgraded, these processes instances cause an exception to be thrown by JBPM since the SUID of a specific class instance has changed in the main application.p  pI believe I have a method for fixing the deserialization process using the technique described in the followingp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions795470howtodeserializeanobjectpersitedinadbnowwhentheobecthasdifferentseHow to deserialize an object persited in a db now when the obect has different serialVersionUIDap  pHowever, my problem is figuring out where in MySQL JBPM stores process instance variables, so I can write a program that can interate over all the variables for all instances, an reserialize the variables so the offending class will have the new SUID, so JBPM can operate against the processes.p  pMy initial looking at the JBPM tables, it appears that the JBPMBYTEARRAY andor JBPMBYTEBLOCK may be the tables to operate against.  However, Im unsure how to proceed.  Im guessing each process variable is stored in a wrapping container class.  Is that class codeorg.jbpm.context.exe.VariableInstancecode  Or is it something elsep  pI figure if I have the proper jar files in the class path, and I know what the main class instance is that JBPM uses to store process variables in MySQL, I can deserialize the class which will fix the SUID problem with the embedded problem class instance, and reserialize the class back.  Since JBPM documentation does mention stuff about converters, Im unsure if I have to replicate the conversion process JPBM does when deserializing, or if standard java deserialization is enough.p

What would be an appropriate data structure for thisp  pa balanced binary search tree as done in C STL associative data structures like set,mapp  porp  pa trie on stringsp  pstrongSome complexity analysisstrong in a balanced bst, time would be log nm   comparing 2 string takes Om time character by characterp  pin trie, if at each node, we could branch out in O1 time, we can find using Om, but the assumption that at each node, we can branch in O1 time is not valid. at each node, max possible branches would be 26. if we want O1 at a node, we will keep a short array indexible on characters at each node. This will blowup the space. After a few levels in the trie, branching will reduce, so its better to keep a linked list of next node characters and pointers.p  pwhat looks more practical any other tradeoffs p  pThanks,p

For example, one of these apps started to fail every request by throwing an ImportError insidep  precodefrom django.contrib.gis.maps.google import GMarker, GEvent codepre  pWe collected codestracecode output and the relevant chunk is below absolute path replaced with DIR for brevity and protecting the guilty.p  precodestat64DIRdjangocontribgismapsgoogleGMarker, 0xf699ce3c  1 ENOENT No such file or directory openDIRdjangocontribgismapsgoogleGMarker.so, ORDONLYOLARGEFILE  1 ENOENT No such file or directory openDIRdjangocontribgismapsgoogleGMarkermodule.so, ORDONLYOLARGEFILE  1 ENOENT No such file or directory openDIRdjangocontribgismapsgoogleGMarker.py, ORDONLYOLARGEFILE  1 ENOENT No such file or directory openDIRdjangocontribgismapsgoogleGMarker.pyc, ORDONLYOLARGEFILE  1 ENOENT No such file or directory codepre  pand once again the same thing sGMarkerGEventp  pAfter restarting the process everything runs smoothly, also runningp  precodepython c from django.contrib.gis.maps.google import GMarker codepre  pproduces no errors.p  pThe GMarker and GEvent classes are actually defined in codedjango.contrib.gis.maps.google.overlayscode and imported in code...mapsgoogleinit.pycodep  precodefrom django.contrib.gis.maps.google.gmap import GoogleMap, GoogleMapSet from django.contrib.gis.maps.google.overlays import GEvent, GIcon, GMarker, GPolygon, GPolyline from django.contrib.gis.maps.google.zoom import GoogleZoom codepre  pso its fully expected that loading GMarker.py et al. will fail. It seems that Python has somehow forgotten about codeinit.pycode and its namespace.p  pThe apps are relatively hightraffic and it is conceivable though not certain that they might have exceeded their VM limits and recovered almostgracefully. Also, at least in two cases the app had earlier problems leading to a crash  SIGSEGV in one case, and err... something else in the other.

Negative 522 pIm trying to use MVVM for the first time.  I have a Windows Phone app Mango, which has a model class, a view model class, and a view xaml page.  I have controls textboxes bound to the VM, and the VM is bound to the Model.  p  pBoth the model and the view model implement codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode.  The implementation Im using is copied, so that I could use it to try to figure out what Im doing with INPC.  Here is the code that is listed in both classesp  precodepublic event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged  private void NotifyPropertyChangedString info     if PropertyChanged  null           PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgsinfo      codepre  pI have one property in the Model class that can be either set manually from a textbox or calculated by changing one of the other properties.  Lets call that one Result.  p  pIf I change one of the other properties, and step through, INPC is invoked in both the changed property and the recalculated property in the Model class, although codePropertyChangedcode is codenullcode, so that portion of the code is skipped.  Then in the VM, the property that was changed steps through that class INPC as part of the set accessor, and this time codePropertyChangedcode is not codenullcode, so the codePropertyChangedcode method is invoked.  For the codeResultcode property, however, INPC is not raised that property doesnt have INPC invoked by the other propertys set accessor.  p  pHere is one of the properties in the Model, which is not the calculated propertyp  precodepublic int AgeSetting     get           return intGetValueOrDefaultAgeSettingKeyName, AgeSettingDefault        set           AddOrUpdateValueAgeSettingKeyName, value       Calculate      codepre  pHere is the property of the Calculated value in the Model.p  precodepublic int PointsSetting     get           return intGetValueOrDefaultPointsSettingKeyName, PointsSettingDefault        set           AddOrUpdateValuePointsSettingKeyName, value      codepre  pFrom the ViewModel, here are both propertiesp  precodepublic int Age     get           return person.AgeSetting        set           person.AgeSetting  value       NotifyPropertyChangedAge        public int PointsAllowed     get           return person.PointsSetting        set           person.PointsSetting  value       NotifyPropertyChangedPointsAllowed      codepre  pHaving never done this before, I was expecting that INPC should bubble up from the model class, to the VM class, to the UI.

I just dont know how to get from the calculated value in the model, to the view model, and up to the view.  p  pThank you for any suggestions.p

However, I want contentwise comparison. That means that if content is added or removed that will cause everything after the change to be shiffted, then I do not want the shifted content to be considered as changed.p  pOne option is to extract the text from the pdf files and then doing a text comparison using an algorithm like the one proposed by Eugene W.

Negative 522 pI was doing a little job for a friend of mine in ASP Since his server runs IIS I usually script websites in PHP therefor im not that well known in ASP. Yet the job was simple so i took it on. What he wanted was a form page where he could insert andor edit existing form elements, and a ASP page wich renders them and send the result to an email. All this works great within my script. The only problem is, that it does not order the form elements as their seen on the forms html page, it is somehow mixing them.

Negative 522 pI am maintaining a large wordpress site and I am attempting to troubleshoot an unrelated problem by adding trace statements in the code which are nothing more than calls to errorlog. In brief my server setup is a file server which shares out the websites document root via nfs. There are 2 web servers which are running nginxapcphpfpm. I am editing the php files directly on the file server and when I view the files from the web servers i can see my changes however when I tail the error log i can observe that my changes are not immediately reflected. I continue to see old trace statements as if I hadnt made the change at all.p  pMy running theory is that the code is getting cached either in apc duh or in a clientside nfs cache unlikely since i can see the edits with vi. I try to mitigate this by flushing the apc cache using a script which runs apcclearcache. Additionally I have restarted nginx as well as phpfpm hoping that something will flush the old cached php code. None of these methods have worked and I must resort to waiting up to an hour or more before i see my code changes reflected in the logs.p  pThe website I am troubleshooting is fairly high traffic so remounting the nfs share is not really an option for me. My assumption is that the apc opcode cache is not actually clearing but I have been watching the stats with apc.php and I do see what looks like the cache being rebuilt after i run my flush script. Ive been at this for a couple days and troubleshooting a simple problem has turned into a huge headache. Can anyone provide any ideas of other things to look at or try to make my code changes more immediatep

Negative 522 pNote the tag strongVBAstrong, not VB6, not VB.NET. p  pThis is specific to VBA in MS Access. Ive built a collection of methods in an module I call Enumerable.

The following does NOT workp  precodeDebug.Print RunReplace, Input, In, Out codepre  pIt throws runtime error 430 Class does not support Automation or does not support expected interface. This is expected, because the documentation states that Application.Run only works for userdefined methods.p  pVBA does have an AddressOf operator, but that only works when passing function pointers to external API functions function pointers created using AddressOf are not consumable in VBA.

Negative 522 pIm building a basic calculator app. The calculator is already fully functional with basic features.

Negative 522 pIm developing a small game with pyglet. One centerpiece is, of course, drawing coloured rectangels.

As the error occurs somewhere deep in the event loop, I cannot easily track down which position update causes it. Honestly, Im stumped. Thus Ill braindump what I have found out and hope for some kind psychic.p  pIve tried it out on Windows 7 32 bit I may get around to try it on Ubuntu 11.10 soon with Python 3.2.2, with a pyglet revision 043180b64260 pulled from Goggle Code and built from source, the 1.1.4 release is harder to install as it doesnt run 2to3 automatically, though it appears to be equally py3kready.

Negative 522 pI am implementing a basic board game in Java and that I am having difficulty deciding the pros and cons of in solving. I am already successfully making use of the Command Pattern to enable undo functionality in the game, and originally intended to implement game savingloading by serializing the entire set of game model objects. p  pHowever I realised that as the game is a board game with no random elements involved and always initialising with the same state, I could implement saveload functionality by simply serializing the object containing the command stack and the commands themselves up to that point, and then reexecute all of the commands in order to bring the game up to the saved position.p  pMy current design does not allow me to do this, as my Commands hold references to the object instances that form my boards tiles and pieces, which I believe is best OO practice. That would mean I would also have to serialise those model objects, which would defeat the purpose of just serialising the commands and executing them. My question is whether having the commands just hold the integer locations of the boards tiles would be considered bad practice.p  pRelevant portion of my Command class codep  precodeprivate GameController controller private Tile sourceTile private Tile[] route  public MoveCommandGameController controller, Tile sourceTile, Tile... route      this.controller  controller     this.sourceTile  sourceTile     this.route  route   Override public void execute      controller.executeMovesourceTile, route  codepre  pI intend to change the Tile references into references to a new serializable class called TileLocation or something to that effect, which will hold an X and Y integer so that the board can find the tiles.p

Negative 522 pI have a problem where I have to find the distance, or ticks, from one location on a lock to the other.  For example, assuming a combination lock with numbers 0  39, I want to move from 38 to 10, and get 12, which is the number of ticks it takes to get from 38 to 10.  This can be set up as 38  x mod 40  10, except that there isnt any way to isolate the x because of the modulus operation.  Can anyone think of a way to create a simple formula to find that there are 12 ticks between 38 and 10.  I know how to do it using conditional branching, but I would prefer to use a formula if possible.p

Negative 522 pIm using TeamCity 7 as CI Server, and Id have to test several Web Application plugins, mainly written with PHP. Im familiar with ANT and Unit, but I have an issue to solve to properly test a plugin, my idea would be the followingp  ol liCleanup the testing environment.li liInstall a clean copy of the Web Application which will host the plugin.li liInstall the plugin.li liEnable the plugin.li liRun the tests.li ol  pObviously, running the tests on an installed environment is the easy part. Most tests are fired by directly calling plugins classes methods, yet the framework must be configured, even with minimal settings, to allow calling its bootstrap file and perform due initialization. I tried running the tests in an environment I prepared manually, and they run as expected.p  pThe issue is now automating the installation of the standard Web Application, and, most importantly, its configuration. The basic steps are the followingp  ol liUnzip framework somewhere done.li liCreate a Database done.li liCreate a Database User ans assign it propert privileges done.li liRun Web Applications setup.li ol  pThe tricky part is that not all Web Application implement a command line interface, such as emdrushem for Drupal, hence I came out with two possible ways to complete the installationp  pstrongSimulate manual installation via CURLstrongp  ul liTake note of the installation steps and the forms that need to be filled.li liPOST data to each of the forms using CURL.li ul  pI tried this method, still manually, with acceptable results. The Web Application gets installed as expected, and it can be used.br However, this requires a Web Server where the application can run. As far as I know, TeamCity Agents work in their own, random named directories and anything installed in them cannot be accessed via HTTP requests.p  pstrongBackupRestorestrong  p  ul liManually preinstall a Web Application and configure its basic settings.li liZip the Applications directory and a backup of its database.li liBefore running the tests, unzip the directory in Agents working directory.li liRestore the backedup database. The application will now be configured.li ul  pThis method is a bit rough, but it doesnt require a Web Server to be running. Although the Web Application wont be able to server HTTP requests, that doesnt necessarily matter, as the tests will be run against plugins classes.p  pThis method has two major drawbacks, thoughp  ul liTests involving interaction with the Web Application e.g. hooks, event handlers, and so on cant be run.li liSince the Web Application and its database are preconfigured, their parameters will be the same at every run. Therefore, it wouldnt be possible to run two Agents at the same time, for example to test two different plugins.li ul  pIm now wondering if theres a better solution, as both the above look less than optimal to me.p  pPlease note that, although Im using TeamCity, the CI Server itself should not be a big deal, as Im running everything with ANT. Therefore, any suggestion, even related to another CI Serverm, will be welcome I know Hudson, CruiseControl and BuildMaster, I can adapt a concept easily. Thanks.p

Negative 522 pFor example, Im developing a gem, and while Im developing, I use codeprycode instead of IRB, and codedebuggercode for debugging.

Negative 522 pWe are developping a GWT 2.4 application using Maven. Due to the problem described a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitissuesdetailid6809 relnofollowherea we tried to switch to GWT 2.5. We also switched to version 2.5 for mavengwtplugin from org.codehaus.mojo. We had no problems with this arrangement I mean running and debugging the GWT 2.5 application  using goals gwtrun and gwtdebug until we decided to build a new war. For this we are using mavenwarplugin version 2.3. To our surprise the war file building runs out of memory no matter how much memory we allow in the vm arguments  we increased those until the limit of the physical memory about 4 GB but to no result. The combination of goals we use to build our war is compile gwtcompile warwar, the sources are compiled correctly, but then the building process does not create even the first permutation as it runs out of memory.  If we go back to version 2.4 both for gwt and mavengwtplugin the war is built correctly with no other changes. Has anyone been faced with this problem before Any suggestions for a proper solution that would allow us to build a 2.5 gwt war would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 522 pMore often than not we need loops like thisp  precodedo       Type valueGetCurrentValue      Processvalue whileconditionvalue codepre  pUnfortunately this will not compile, because codevaluecodes scope ends at codecode.

For one, I like declaring things locally. And second, this is a problem if value is not assignable or defaultconstructible, but only copyconstructible.p  pSo, my question has two sides. First, Id like to know if there was a particular reasondifficulty in extending the do whiles scope to the final condition as well just as the scope of variables declared in for loop includes the body of the for loop despite it physically being outside of the braces. And if you believe that the answer to my first question is Its just the way it is. Dont ask why questions. then Id like to know if there are idioms that can help write dowhile loops similar to the ones in my example but without the downsides I mentioned. p  pHope the questions are clear.p

There is no pattern to the direction the vertices will walk along the edge of the polygon, it could go clockwise or counterclockwise around the polygon.

The second can only be solved by running a codePointInPolycode check on each point, which would make this solution much heavier than I want it to be.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Iterating each pixel in the entire image and applying a codePointInPolycode check to each is also unacceptable it would be even slower than the above algorithm.p

But when Iserver sent the request to the jsp page, the controls in the form are getting reset to their original value. But I dont want to override the users input after the request was made. One way to achieve this is to take value of the property for each control in the form when request is made and then set them again while responding. Actually there are a large number of controls in my form, taking values of each doesnt seem efficient.p  pSo is there some other way to keep the form in the jsp file unchanged while responding to the client.p

I would like to have an ever changing list of, say 50 songs for purchase.p  pThe docs Paypal has are pretty crummy IMO.

Negative 522 pI need to find a way to tell the C compiler of my program that a certain structure is the same as the other structure they are identical in definition. I figured casting would be decent enough, but maybe its not a good ideap  pThe reason that I am not just using one struct is because the structs are defined in very heavy framework classes and I have a lot of different classes of my own importing the class that requires the use of the structure in its code.hcode.p  pSo, how can I tell the compiler that codeStruct Acode can be used for a function requiring codeStruct Bcode, given that they are identical, if it is even possiblep  hr  pTo make this very specific, in my case, I have a singleton that is accessed and utilized by around 14 classes. Some of the functions in the singleton work alongside the other classes and provide resources and data for their specific imports. One of which is the MapKit framework. There are a number of structs within the MapKit framework that I have been utilizing especially MKUserLocation.h, but will import a number of other classes and add on a lot to the definition.p  pA specific example for me is using CLLocationCoordinate2D, which I have had to recreate in my singleton so that not all 14 classes import from the MapKit framework. It just seems excessive.p  pI know how to make this all work, but there should be a good solution to this other than casting or importing to everything.p

Negative 522 pIve been working on a bitmap loader, with the main goal to do nothing more than parse the data properly and render it in OpenGL. Im at the point where I need to draw the pixels on an xy i.e., pixel by pixel basis at least, this is what I think I need to do as far as rendering is concerned. Ive already bound the texture object and called codeglTexImage2D...code. p  pCurrently, what Im having trouble with is the pixel by pixel algorithm. p  pAs far as I understand it, bitmap aka DIB files store strongcolor datastrong in what is known as the strongpixel arraystrong. Each row of pixels consists of codexcode amount of bytes, with each pixel holding a byte count divisible either by 4  32 bits per pixel , 3  24 bits per pixel , 2  16 bits per pixel , or 1  8 bits per pixel . p  pstrongI think need to loop through the pixels while at the same time calculating the right offset within the pixel array, which is relative to its pixel xy coordinate. Is this true, though If not, what should I dostrong Im honestly slightly confused as to whether or not, despite doing what was directed to me in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq14187783763053this question I asked sometime agoa, this approach is correct. p  pI assume that going about it on a pixel by pixel basis is the right approach, mainly because  rendering a quad with codeglVertexcode and codeglTexCoordcode produced nothing more than a grayed out rectangle at the time I thought the OpenGL would handle this by itself, hence why attempting that in the first place.p  pI should also note that, while my question displays OpenGL 3.1 shaders, I moved to SDL 1.2  so I could just use immediate mode for the time being until I got the right algorithms implemented, and then switch back to modern GL.p  hr  pThe test image Im parsingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8ZInZ.png altbitmap imagep  pIts data output pastebinned due to its very long length a hrefhttppastebin.com6RVhAVRq relnofollowhttppastebin.com6RVhAVRqap  pstrongAnd The Codestrongp  precodevoid RRenderTexturePixByPix texturebmpt const data, const vec3 center         glBindTexture GLTEXTURE2D, datagttexbufid       glBegin GLPOINTS               const unsigned width   datagtimgdatagtwidth   unsigned int  center[ VECX ]         const unsigned height  datagtimgdatagtheight   unsigned int  center[ VECY ]          const unsigned bytecount     GetByteCount datagtimgdatagtbpp           const unsigned char pixels  datagtimgdatagtpixels          unsigned coloroffset  0         unsigned xpixel          for  xpixel  center[ VECX ] xpixel lt width xpixel                       unsigned ypixel              for  ypixel  center[ VECY ] ypixel lt height ypixel                                          const bool docolorupdate  true lt replace true with a condition which checks to see if the color needs to be updated.              if  docolorupdate                               glColor3fv pixels  coloroffset                            coloroffset  bytecount                   glEnd      glBindTexture GLTEXTURE2D, 0   codepre

Negative 522 pEven though it does not have much documentation I can find on the subject I know that in mediaelement.js you can change the skin of the audio player or modify the CSS to create your own skin. I am running into a problem where I cant even get the default mediaelement.js skin to replace the browser player therefore I cant modify the default CSS to my styling needs. And when I try to use the player.changeSkin method which mediaelement.js uses on their site it halts the program. I am including the skin CSS as well as the other required mediaelement.js files, at least to the best of my knowledge, and they player works fine until I try to change the skin. I am using this code to stream audio and you can find a working version last working upload before trying to skin the player at a hrefhttpescapetodenton.comradiocompactplayer.htmlhttpescapetodenton.comradiocompactplayer.htmla.

Negative 522 pI have a set of points which form some curve, see picture. This curve consists of straight and curved sections and I do not know exactly where they start or end. In the presented picture I know at least five pieces two straight sections, one section with a constant radius, two other types of curves. I want to be able to recognise those sections, to separate them from each other and to work with them as with separate curves. p  pUpdate.p  pIn my opinion splines would not work in the way I want, and not surely Besier. I was thinking about Nonlinear Least Squares but was not sure if it suits this case. If I am able to separate the parts, then I can use Linear Least Squares for straights and some nonlinear for other parts. Otherwise, I need some universal method which will work for all types of curves 1, 2 and 3 power.p  pPlease share your thoughts. Thank you. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUATly.png altthe curvep

Negative 522 pI want to query a database for a column name to find the table without knowing the table name there are a huge number of tablesp  pI am working with a huge database at the moment and trying to find where, based on CFML code and the URL of the problematic page, a website is retrieving information from. I am new to ColdFusion however I can see that the URL contains a few ID references with column names. Some I have been able to find easily and others, I have no idea as the column names are quite vague e.g. NTASKID.p  pMy plan is to try to query the database using the column name but Google has presented me queries which require knowing the table name which I do not have. I guess those examples may have been more useful for denormalised tables.p  pIf someone knows such a query it would be great.

Negative 522 pIve inherited a Zend Framework web application that is neither objectoriented nor wellwritten in many respects, and it came with zero tests.  So while I appreciate the value of unit tests, and will write them as I add or rewrite code, functional tests with code coverage seems like the best place to start.  It also makes a great learning tool for understanding how the application works.  This is Zend Framework 1.11, and Matthew Weier OPhinney has stated that ZendTest only works with PHPUnit up through 3.4.  So I installed the latest 3.4.15.  Ive verified that I can extend ZendTestPHPUnitControllerTestCase and do unit testing on controllers that way.p  pFor functional testing through Selenium, I had some trouble getting code coverage to work.  In fact I doubted that it was technically feasible to get coverage data given the way that the Selenium server works, but with help from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11270527doesphpunitseleniumcodecoveragework12297192Does PHPUnitSelenium Code Coverage Worka and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11270527doesphpunitseleniumcodecoverageworkDoes PHPUnitSelenium Code Coverage Worka I finally got it working with my application.  Its great being able to see what parts of the code are hit by different requestsp  pBut the problem Im now seeing is that the code handling POST requests doesnt seem to get reported.p  pFor example in a controller I have a contactAction method with code like thisp  precodethisgtviewgtform  form  if thisgtgetRequestgtisPost     if formgtisValidthisgtgetRequestgtgetPost       values  formgtgetValues codepre  pThis is for a Contact Us form.  In a Selenium test I open the url, type the message, click the submit button, and wait for the page load.  When I run the test I can see this happen in the browser, and receive the email with the message that was typed by selenium, so Im certain that the form was posted with valid data, and that the second two lines did execute.  But in the coverage report, the first two lines are green, and the second two are orange.p  pI instrumented both the prepend.php and append.php scripts to log the following informationp  precode     File  . FILE .  REQUESTMETHOD  . SERVER[REQUESTMETHOD] . n .      REQUESTURI  . SERVER[REQUESTURI] . n .      COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  . printrissetCOOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID], 1 . n .      GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  . printrissetGET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID], 1 . n .      POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  . printrissetPOST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID], 1 . n . codepre  pOne odd thing is that only the prepend script ever gets logged, never the append script.  I have no idea why, but it doesnt seem to affect the coverage data for GET requests at least.  The only thing Ive seen that might explain it is if the Zend MVC app ends with an exit  Does that make sensep  pHere is what gets logged for the contact us interactionp  precodeFile Cxampphtdocsmyapppublicprepend.php REQUESTMETHOD GET REQUESTURI indexcontact COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID] 1 GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  extensionloadedxdebug 1  File Cxampphtdocsmyapppublicprepend.php REQUESTMETHOD GET REQUESTURI indexcontact COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID] 1 GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  extensionloadedxdebug 1  File Cxampphtdocsmyapppublicprepend.php REQUESTMETHOD POST REQUESTURI indexcontact COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID] 1 GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  extensionloadedxdebug 1  File Cxampphtdocsmyapppublicprepend.php REQUESTMETHOD GET REQUESTURI defaultindexcontact COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID] 1 GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  extensionloadedxdebug 1  File Cxampphtdocsmyapppublicprepend.php REQUESTMETHOD GET REQUESTURI defaultindexcontact COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID] 1 GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  extensionloadedxdebug 1  File Cxampphtdocsmyapppublicprepend.php REQUESTMETHOD GET REQUESTURI phpunitcoverage.phpPHPUNITSELENIUMTESTIDa85030b0bcdb0460bfb17a83a373d6b5 COOKIE[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  GET[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID] 1 POST[PHPUNITSELENIUMTESTID]  extensionloadedxdebug 1 codepre  pAs you can see, the GET requests get logged twice, and the POST only once.  Perhaps that is related to the fact that only the GET requests seem to get covered while the POSTS dont  But I really dont understand this behavior in several ways, and Im at a loss for what to do to help figure it out.p  pAnybody got any ideas either about why Im not getting coverage for the POST requests, or what the next step might be to track it downp

Negative 522 pIve got some issues with development and deployment of a sharepoint app. The App is going to be an App Part in a SharePoint site.p  pOne issue is, that the app provider hosted is not high trusted, although I went through the msdn tutorial how to create a high trusted app with certificate etc. Everytime I deploy the app, I get the error The specified application identifier is invalid or does not exist.p  pThe second issue is, that the App uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. The problem is, that I can only manipulate the DOM of the App Part. But I want to manipulate the DOM of the SharePoint site itself, and all DOMs laying in it all other Web or App Parts included in the Site.p  pIs this possiblep  pFor example, in the App I want to manipulate the Menu of the SharePoint Site this wayp  precodedocument.getElementByIdzz15RootAspMenu. do something codepre  pThis way I could add Menupoints. But I have no access to zz15RootAspMenu because its in the outer DOM.p  pCould it be possible, that the solution to the first issue leads to the solution of the second p  pThe App is currently running on the SharePoint Machine on localhost. Im working with a Remote Desktop so the App is running on the SharePoint Server but is called via localhost from there If the App is deployed correctly, could it be that only then the App is imported correctly into the Site and then I can access its DOMp

Negative 522 pSuppose I have a dictionary p  precode15, 25, 45 codepre  pIs there a data structure such that if I add the keyvalue pair code35code, to have it entered in the dictionary so that the keys are in sorted order i.e. p  precode15, 25, 35, 45 codepre  pI am aware of the codecollections.OrderedDictcode, but this only keeps the keys in the order in which they were added which isnt sufficient for me currently. p  pI dont want to have to use a normal dictionary codedic  code, then have to use codesorteddic[0]code to grab the smallest key. Id rather have codesorteddict[0]code type function.br The reason for this is that if I use a normal dictionary, I will have to call the sort multiple times, as I am continuously adding pairs to my dictionary.p  pEDIT I should have mentioned, its not only the smallest and largest keys I care about, I will also need to print this dictionary at regular intervals as well...p

Negative 522 pI have been scouting the web for a pdf editing tool for quite some time now. And it would therefore be nice with some suggestionsrecommendations to the problem.p  pI have read a bunch of other topics around StackOverflow, but havent quite been able to find a full solution yet. p  pstrongThe casestrong  I have an application written in phpjavascript on a linux server and recently it has become a requirement for my customers that they are able to edit Pdf documents direct in the browser. The functions i need are primarily the ability to make annotations and to draw on the PDF. That means. They load an already uploaded PDFdocument and edits it and then saves it in PDFformat again. All done within the browser. p  pThe second requirement is that the program must save pdf document in PDFformat again, since i have an Ipad app with all of this functionality, and i need them to play nicely together. It is therefore not an option to save an image of html of something like that.p  pI read a comment suggesting the Zend framework, and it did sound quite useful. However i have developed my own platform from the ground, and therefore my second question is, if it is possible to embed only the PDFtool from Zend or something p  pThank you in advance.p  pps. If i missed a simular subject that answers exactly this, please let me know and ill delete again. p

Negative 522 pA a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBasicblock relnofollowstrongBasic Blockstronga is an assembly snippet with only one entrance point and one exit point the Wikipedia link also has a more rigorous definition. Many compiler optimization passes rely on the compiler breaking the users code down into basic blocks before giving them to the optimizer.p  pIm curious to know what nonlocal effects can affect performance of a basic block itself. By nonlocal effects I mean how code outside the basic block run before it may affect its running time, or how where the code is laid out in memory may affect it. This is a bit more restrictive than worrying about performance of arbitrary programs with looping, branching, etc. p  pOff the top of my head cache use by other parts of the program, both memory and instruction cache, seems like the biggest possible nonlocal effect. Also the state of the pipeline setup by previously executed instructions or earlier instructions currently in flight. Im interested in x86x8664 specifically but effects on other architectures seem worth knowing too. Are there other nonlocal effectsp

Negative 522 pI have a singlepage web app that uses Knockout.js 2.2.1 to display information streaming from a server using socket.io, although I dont think that matters.  This app also contains a large data table, which is created from a JSON object using Knockouts codeforeachcode bindings.  The table is big, but not enormous 20 columns and 200 rows or so.p  pSince the table is large, it can be openedclosed by the user by clicking buttons.  The data codelttablegtcode is placed inside a codeltdivgtcode element that I can hideshow using jQuerys code.hidecode and code.showcode methods which essentially work by setting and clearing CSS codedisplay nonecode on the codeltdivgtcode.p  pAll of this functionality works.  However, I notice that after closing hiding the big data table, Chromes CPU usage jumps  all the way to 100 if the Knockoutgenerated table is big enough.  Whats more interesting is that this emonlyem happens after the user has clicked somewhere inside the codeltdivgtcode element that contains the table when it is shown.  When the table is hidden and CPU usage is high, clicking somewhere else on the page will return CPU usage back to normal.  The process will repeat at will.p  pAnother possibly useful note if I stop the streaming data from the server this problem doesnt happen or, its not noticeable in the CPU usage.  There is a single Knockout view model on this page, which manages both the streaming data from the server and the creation of this data table from a JSON object.  The two sets of data are otherwise completely separate  none of the changing data is displayed in the table, and the table contains no event bindings back to the view model.  Its as if the streaming data update of the Knockout model is causing work on the data table even though none of the streaming data is bound to the table.  emAndem it does this only when the table is emnotem displayedp  pstrongQuick summarystrongp  ul liWeb app uses Knockout to render a large data table when the page is loaded.li liThis table is hidden with code.hidecode at startup in codedocument.readycode, but is displayed using code.showcode, after clicking a button, and can be hidden againli liIf the mouse is clicked inside the data table, CPU usage in Chrome will jump to 100 after the table is hidden again.li liClicking anything else on the page will bring the CPU usage back to normal.li ul  pstrongOther relevant informationstrongp  ul liThe Chrome JavaScript profiler shows the high CPU usage, but its categorized simply as program time.li liNeither IE10 nor Firefox 20 on Windows show this problem.li ul  pAny ideas whats going on here, or suggestions for additional troubleshootingp  pstrongjsFiddlestrongp  pExample here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCTYMv6httpjsfiddle.netCTYMv6ap  pLook at CPU usage after loading the fiddle, it should be low.  Click Show Table, then click somewhere inside the div that pops up gray background.  Then click Hide Table  CPU usage will increase significantly.  Then click anywhere else white background, and CPU will return to normal.p
Negative 522 pThis problem has annoyed me for years, and Im wondering if anyone has had a solution. The problem is that in C mode, it seems like emacs cant decide if the  codeltcode operator is less than or begin template parameters, which messes up the autoindent feature. Consider something like thisp  precodebool foo    return X lt Y ampamp              Y lt Z  codepre  pThat Y is way over to the right and if I run codecsetoffsetcode with codeCc Cocode on the line with codeY lt Zcode, it tells me that the current line offset is codetemplateargscontcode. The worst part is that any code below this, including other functions, will have totally screwed up tabbing. Usually I just carefully manually space the beginning of the next function.p  pEDIT To confirm, the following code indents correctlyp  precodebool foo    return X  Y ampamp     Y  Z  codepre  pEDIT 2 I have some custom style and offset stuff, but even starting emacs with q to ignore my .emacs file shows the same problem. Im currently using versionp  precodeGNU Emacs 24.1.1 x8664appledarwin, NS appleappkit1038.36  of 20120610 on bob.porkrind.org codepre  pOn mac OS X 10.8 but Im sure Ive seen the same problem on ubuntu, but Id have to go double check versions.p  pHas anyone found a solution to this Corey discovered that adding parens codeX lt Ycode is a workaround.p
Negative 522 pIm a junior programmer and I know the basics of pascal and c. I made a Tic Tac Toe game with PlayerComputer and the game is all finished.p  pThe computer generates a random place where the Os go on the table and thats not good.p  pI thought that i should multiple procedures that check every winning position and the computer should else try to block the players Xs or to make a winning position, BUT this would have been lots of time lost cause all of the ifs.p  pThen I thought of a simpler version with some kind of ifs but it would still have been taking lots of time to do.p  pThen i thought deeper What about a findfour game How in the earth someone would manage to check every space available and how it wouldve been possible that someone could make a function that checks absolutely any winning or progress of playercomputer position, Oh and wait, thats not ALL, what if the player is doing some tricks so he blocks the computer How would the computer know that For sure, that would take ages to program. And I am not talking about something that seems more impossible Chess.p  pSo here I am, asking myself that there SHOULD be a way more simpler way the computer should search and solve some problems than tons of ifs. p  pIn this case, if any of you know any way of solving this, how can i manage to make the simplest procedure to block and beat the player in a TicTacToe gamep  pIf someone wants to check my code or use it a hrefhttppastebin.comjhyUn7d1 relnofollowhttppastebin.comjhyUn7d1ap

Negative 522 pI suspect that this relates to having managedcode DLL projects in the solution, since in VS2010 the menuitem was also missing unless I manually unloaded all managedcode projects from the solution.p  pIn VS2012 though, I now have many more managed DLLs in the solution not by personal choice, so I am hoping that there might be a way to enable Apply Code Changes even with managed DLLs in the solution.p  pI have set my local debugging mode to Native Only and also edited the Edit and Continue options under Debug  Options and Settings... to enable native Edit and Continue, but still I get no Apply Code Changes icon under the Debug menu.p  pIf I manually add the Apply Code Changes button to a toolbar, it remains continually disabled.p  pPlease can anyone offer any hints and tips as to how I might get this to work, or do I simply have to unload all managedcode projects from the solutionp  pSupposing that I do have to unload the managedcode projects, is there a straightforward way to maintain two different sets of solution options so that I can quickly decide whether I wish to mount all projects or nativeonlyp
Negative 522 pGot a questions about finding a string in a list using Python. First I open my Excelfile using xlrd, and make a list of one column. This column are all the communities I want to use. Next I have another file with communities and I only want to use those communities that are present in the excelfile I opened before. Shortly, I do a piece with the following codep  precodeimport xlrd book  xlrd.openworkbookCUsersYannickDesktopMASTERPROEFBestandenLAMBITExcelFilesFromAANTWERPCORRECT.xls sh  book.sheetbyindex0 gemeente  CELLES rl  sh.colvalues4,startrowx1 print rl if gemeente in rl     print OK codepre  pBut it gives a problem. It prints OK, what means that CELLES is linked with  a community called COURCELLES in the list I know because CELLES is not in the list. Thus when python searches the list for CELLES, it gives a positive match with COURCELLES. Does anyone has an idea how to search for 100  identical matches So that CELLES never get linked with COURCELLES, just because ema part of the stringem is identicalp

Negative 522 pOkay, well, this is my first time working with encryption on a project. I am using my hosting provider for SSL, but I also want to encrypt portions of the database that are sensitive. For this, I was told to use OpenSSL. I am testing it on my localhost WAMP, and have installed OpenSSL and turned on the PHP and Apache SSL mods. Okay, so ive been following tutorials and, using several suggested methods, have been able to generate the public key and store it as a file. For some reason, I cant seem to generate the private key. I will post two versions of code that ive triedp  precode generate private key privateKey  opensslpkeynewarray     privatekeybits gt 1024,     privatekeytype gt OPENSSLKEYTYPERSA,   write private key to file opensslpkeyexporttofileprivateKey, private.key  generate public key from private key publicKey  opensslpkeygetdetailsprivateKey  write public key to file fileputcontentspublic.key, publicKey[key]  clear key echo privateKey  gt codepre  pThis generates a public.key file, but provides me the warnings opensslpkeyexporttofile cannot get key from parameter 1 and  opensslpkeygetdetails expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean.p  pI also tried an alternative methodp  precodeconfig  array     config gt Ewampbinapacheapache2.2.22confopenssl.cnf,     digestalg gt sha512,     privatekeybits gt 1024,     privatekeytype gt OPENSSLKEYTYPERSA,    Create the private and public key res  opensslpkeynewconfig   Extract the private key from res to privKey opensslpkeyexportres, privKey, NULL echo Private Key .privKey  Extract the public key from res to pubKey pubKey  opensslpkeygetdetailsres pubKey  pubKey[key] echo Public Key .pubKey data  plaintext data goes here echo Data .data  Encrypt the data to encrypted using the public key opensslpublicencryptdata, encrypted, pubKey echo Encrypted .encrypted  Decrypt the data using the private key and store the results in decrypted opensslprivatedecryptencrypted, decrypted, privKey  echo Decrypted .decrypted codepre  pThis was supposed to echo everything, unfortunately my result was a blank private key, a fine public key, plaintext, and encrypted text, and an error when trying to decrypt opensslprivatedecrypt key parameter is not a valid private keyp  pClearly, im having a problem with private key creation. Ive searched the internet thoroughly and havent been able to fix it, even though Ive implemented simple code that seems to work for everyone else.p  pThanks in advance, Elie Zeitounip
Negative 522 pI have a dense scatter plot where I want to control the order of the points being plotted, since using an codealphacode does not work  basically, there is a minority of points that I want to be plotted on top. It sounds like the only way to control this z order of points in ggplot2 is to use layers. I have the followingp  precodedf lt data.framexrnorm10000,yrnorm10000 dfg lt c1 df[500,]g lt cspecial df[600,]g lt cspecial2 ggplotdf  geompointaesxx, yy, colourg codepre  pThis displays a nice legend for the value in the codegcode column. Here the points with the values special, special2 happen to be plotted on top of the rest of the points but many times this is not true and in that case I tried breaking up the dataframe into layers, plotting each layer one by one to ensure I get the order of pointsp  precodedf1 lt df[dfg  special,] df2 lt df[dfg  special2,] df3 lt df[dfg  1,]  plot layer by layer p lt ggplot  geompointaesstringxx,yy, datadf1, colorred p lt p  geompointaesstringxx, yy, datadf2, colorgreen p lt p  geompointaesstringxx, yy, datadf3, colorblue codepre  pthis works but then no legend is shown unlike in the first case where df is plotted with just codecolourgcode. how can I get the legend to showp  pand also, is there a simpler way to do this The original call is perfect except the layering issue. Is there no way to tell ggplot the order, e.g.p  precodeggplotdf  geompointaesxx, yy, colourg, orderc1, special, special2 codepre  pto denote that it should first plot all the points with codegcode value code1code, then all the points with codegcode value codespecialcode, etc.  Breaking up the dataframe into separate one and using layers and then specifying the legend manually is a huge pain just to control the order of points plotted. In the simple first call, ggplot also takes care of the colors for you which is very nice. thanks.p  pps i am using rpy2 to make these plots but i showed R since the translation is usually straightforward to rpy2, but rpy2 solutions would be even better.p
Negative 522 pI recently acquired a new position and found that they had no Version Control.  p  pIll be spending most of my time in Visual Studio, and in the past Ive used preinstalled by previous companies AnkhSVN and Visual SVN, and they all used Visual SVN as their SVN.p  pI would like to continue using either AnkhSVN or VisualSVN plugins for Visual Studio.  Im trying to do this on the cheap, and Ive had a little TortoiseSVN experience so I thought about going that way.  p  pQuestion If I install TortoiseSVN to a network drive, can I use AnkhSVN andor VisualSVN Visual Studio plugins with it   What other alternatives do you suggest if notp  pIm very comfortable using any number of SVN repositories, but I have heretofore never had to actually set one up for use with Visual Studio.p  pThanksp
Negative 522 pI have a situation whereby I would like to create a query against an entity using EclipsLink JPA, I require 5 fields from this entity of which it has many. 2 of those fields are joined OneToMany relationships. I only require 2 primitive fields from each of the joins.p  pWhat is the most efficient way to do thisp  pIve considered a number of possiblities, batch reading seems the best bet based on what I have read however I believe this will only work if I retrieve the full entity i.e. SELECT a FROM Entity a... and the reason I dont want to do this is I have LOB and BLOB types that will eat dangerously into the memory.p  pJoinfetch is another but the entity has 10 joined tables and I dont want to duplicate all of this data.p  pI have been using fetch groups a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgEclipseLinkExamplesJPAAttributeGroup relnofollowhttpwiki.eclipse.orgEclipseLinkExamplesJPAAttributeGroupa and specifying the fields I want which causes cached lazing loading. This is workable and the memory footprint is better. The issue is though when I do entity.getCollection it must do a single SQL statement for each call and this is where I feel it is inefficient. If I could do SELECT a.Field, a.Field2 from Entity A using some form of batching or joinfetching or better still apply this to my fetch group this would be best I would imagine but not sure if I could ensure that it would not load all related tables and only give me the ones I want.p  pHelpthoughts would be much appreciated.p

Negative 522 pI am trying to create a simple app which uses a main view and has a smaller subview within it. I need to have buttons in the subview and I am having trouble getting the connections for the buttons to work. I have done the followingp  ul liCreate a new Viewbased project, which gave me the ViewController.h amp .m, the MainStoryboard.storyboard and the AppDelegate.h amp .m.li liCreate the subView using NewFile  ObjectiveC Class  then naming it subView1 and making it a subclass of UIViewController and checking the with xib check box.li liThis gave me the subView1.h amp.m files and the subView1.xib.li liI then resized the subView in the xib, by setting its size to FreeForm in the attributes inspector and then specifying the width to 280 and height to 300 in the size inspector. I also change the background colour to differentiate it from the main view.li liI then dragged a UIButton into the subView and connected it as an IBAction which i named clickButton1 to the subView1.h file using touchupinside.li liFor testing purposes only i then used a simple NSLog to check the functionality of the button which i placed in the subView.m file as followsli ul  blockquote   pIBActionclickButton1idsender p      pNSLogIt Workedp      pp blockquote  ul liIn my ViewController.m file in the viewDidLoad i then added the following code to add the subview to the main viewli ul  blockquote   psubView1 sv1  [[subView1 alloc]init]p      psv1.view.frame  CGRectMake20,120,280,300p      p[self.view addSubview sv1.view]p blockquote  pThis all worked fine, and when i run the app i get the main view and the subview appear as expected. The problem is when i click on the button which is located in the subview it crashes with the following errorp  blockquote   pThread1EXCBADACCESScode1, address0xe00000008p blockquote  pFrom what i have read i believe this may have something to do with how I am adding the subview and the fact that I am using ARC. Something about once the subview is added it is automatically released and therefore all buttonsconnections etc within the subview are lost.p  pSo my two questions are 1 Am i missing something silly here and is there an easy fix and 2 Is this an appropriate way to create an app which uses subviews with buttons within them or is there a better way Thanks to anyone who takes the time to answerp

When someone requests things codeXcode, codeYcode and codeZcode, I want to look through all the packages, some of which contain more than one item, and give the user the combination of packages that will cover their things and have the minimal price.p  pFor example, I might suggest code[X, Y, Z, Q]code for 10, since code[X, Y, Z]code costs 11. Since these are prices, I cant use the greedy weighted set cover algorithm, because two people getting the same thing for different prices would be bad.p  pHowever, I havent been able to find a paper or anything detailing an optimal algorithm for the weighted set cover problem. Can someone help with an implementation Im using Python, a paper, or even a highlevel description of how it worksp  pThe packages I have are in the hundreds, and the things are 56, so running time isnt really an issue.p  pThanksp

Negative 522 pIm new to grunt.  Im coming from rails and getting into angular.  From what I can see grunt usemin can replace codeltscript src...gtcode between build directives and replace that with a single minified js during grunt build.  Thats great for deployment.  p  pHowever whenever I add new angular controllers during development, I also have to remember to add them to my index.html.  Thats a hassle, and the same goes for if I move my feature folders around, I have to change all my src paths in index.html.  p  pIt would be nice if in development, grunt would watch all my codesrc.jscode and automatically add them all to index.html for me... similar to rails asset pipeline and asset manifest that just does requiretree when youre developing.

Negative 522 pWE have enterprise 2010 on a set of servers 3 front ends, tons of RAM.  We use IE9 exclusively.  The issue is that sometimes the same web based InfoPath form opens very fast and sometimes opens very slow.  By slow I mean one time the form might take up to 1 or 2 minutes by fast I mean the same form opening in a couple of  seconds.   This has nothing to do with the design of the form other than larger more complex forms take more minutes to open than smaller less complex forms but all forms open so slow as to be unacceptable to the user.  They can open both fast or slow within  the same minute.  On our 2007 server they open just fine.  Originally we didnt have this issue.  I dont know whether it was an update, IE 9 or what.  Any suggestions on what it might be or how we might diagnose this issue are welcome.  thanks davep

Negative 522 pI am working on a graph which basically contains at least 150 nodes using D3 Javascript.

Negative 522 pIm doing a bunch of MPIIsend calls to a number of processes to distribute some data. On each call, Im storing the resulting MPIRequest in an array. After all the MPIIsend calls are made, I do a MPIWaitall on the requests.p  pThe order of the messages is important, i.e. I want each process to receive the messages in the same order that Ive sent them. This is because for each piece of data Im sending, Im also distributing some metadata with it, using a separate MPIIsend call. I think this is a bad idea, but I dont know of an alternative. Clearly, the metadata must arrive prior to the data, so I need the FIFO guarantee. Is this the case for what Im doingp  pI dont care about different processes receiving data in different order, Im only interested in individual processes getting the data in the right order. Is this documented anywhere Im using the MPICH2 implementation.p  pI want to distribute an array of doubles with some data associated to it, but the tag is too limited.p

Negative 522 pWhen is a class with no methods poor designp  pFrom what Ive read, a class with no methods i.e. no behaviors AKA dumb class is poor design, with the exception of Data Transfer Objects DTOs.  This is due to the purpose of DTOs being to reduce the overhead when transferring data to a remote interface a hrefhttpwww.martinfowler.comblikiLocalDTO.htmlLocal DTOa.  There appears to be some debate on DTOs and Plain Old Class Object a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions725348pocovsdto725365725365 titlePOCO vs DTOPOCO VS DTOa and debate going further to anemic design a hrefhttpwww.martinfowler.comblikiAnemicDomainModel.htmlAnemic Model Domaina.p  pSo, where the dumb class in question is a local object i.e. not for transferring data are you generally better to refactor the attributes of the dumb class and implement them as a collection e.g. Dictionary  To quote Bill K a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions783198howcaniwritedaosforresourceswithextensiblepropertiesHow can i write DAOs for resources with extensible propertiesa, Where you would have used an object, use a hashtable. For your attribute names use keys, for the attribute values, use the value in the hashtable.p  pMy thinking when designing this dumb class was that of composition.  Another class is composed of multiple dumb class objects i.e. a collection of dumb class objects.  Was my thinking wrong  If I am to implement the dumb class as a collection, I would have a collection of a collection of attributes.  p  pI am of the understanding collections of collections of collections etc. is also poor design.  Is there some guiding principle to balance these apparent choices of poor designp  pAs always any insight or guidance is appreciated.p  pRegards Shannonp

Negative 522 pFrom what I can tell, the SO community is divided on whether declaring a function codenoexceptcode enables meaningful compiler optimizations that would not otherwise be possible.  Im talking specifically about emcompilerem optimizations, not library implementation optimizations based on codemoveifnoexceptcode. For purposes of this question, lets assume that codenoexceptcode does make meaningful codegeneration optimizations possible. With that assumption, does it make sense to declare codeinlinecode functions codenoexceptcode Assuming such functions are actually inlined, this would seem to require that compilers generate the equivalent of a codetrycode block around the code resulting from the codeinlinecode function at the call site, because if an exception arises in that region, codeterminatecode must be called. Without codenoexceptcode, that codetrycode block would seem to be unnecessary.p  pMy original interest was in whether it made sense to declare Lambda functions codenoexceptcode, given that they are implicitly codeinlinecode, but then I realized that the same issues arise for any codeinlinecode function, not just Lambdas.p

Negative 522 pIf you open up the timer app on your iPad, you get this beautiful grey circle that slowly turns red as you come closer to time running out. Id like to learn to mimic this.

Negative 522 pIm building a LIDAR simulator in OpenGL. This means that the fragment shader returns the length of the light vector the distance in place of one of the color channels, normalized by the distance to the far plane so itll be between 0 and 1.

Alpha is unused, but I keep it at 1.p  pHeres my test object, which happens to be a rockp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comth7oi.png altenter image description herep  pI then write the pixel data to a file and load it into a point cloud visualizer one point per pixel  basically the default.

It doesnt show up initially with the default histogram because the density of the planes is pretty high. But when I set the breaks to about 60, I get thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaO751.png altDensity plot of distances about 60 breaks.p  pIve tried shrinking the distance between the near and far planes, in case it was a precision issue. First I was doing 11000, and now Im at 1500. It may have decreased the distance between planes, but I cant tell, because it means the camera has to be closer to the object.p  pIs there something Im missing Does this have to do with the fact that I disabled antialiasing Antialiasing was causing even worse periodic artifacts, but between the camera and the object instead.

Negative 522 pI am trying to secure my RESTful WebApi service with ssl and client authentication using client certificates.p  pTo test I have generated a self signed certificate and placed in the local machine, trusted root certification authorities folder and i have generated a server and client certificates. Standard https to the server works without issue.p  pHowever I have some code in the server to validate the certificate, this never gets called when I connect using my test client which supplies my client certificate and the test client is returned a 403 Forbidden status.p  pThis imples the server is failing my certificate before it reaches my validation code. However if i fire up fiddler it knows a client certificate is required and asks me to supply one to My DocumentsFiddler2.

But if we want to answer many such queries for the same codeDcode and different codeMcode, we might be able to make it faster by preprocessing codeDcode into some smarter data structure.p  pWe could toss all of codeDcode into a hashtable and iterate over all possible subsets of codeMcode, looking each up in the hashtable, but thats codeO2Mcode. Fine for small codeMcode, not so fine for medium to large codeMcode.p  pIs it possible to do this in polynomial time in codeMcode Or maybe to reduce a known NPcomplete problem to this one, to prove that its impossible to be fastp  pEdit I just realized that in the worst case, we need to output all of codeDcode, so codeDcode is still going to appear in the time complexity. So lets assume that the size of the output is bounded by some constant.p

Negative 522 pI am trying to tune my application, and maybe speed it up a little bit. Im using hibernate as my JPA implementation, and I have an entity called Product. It consists of a name, description, id, and an image, represented as a byte[] in the class definition.p  pOn the web tier side, I have a servletProductServlet whose GET method goes out and retrieves a List of all Product objects from the database, puts them in the request as an attribute, and forwards off to a JSP, where the products are displayed in a table. p  pIn order to display the images, based on some advice I found on displaying byte[] data as an image in a JSP I have a separate servletImageServlet whose GET method returns a JPG encoded image of the product whose ID is passed in.p  pMy question is, is there a way I can have the imagebyte[] be lazy loaded, so that when I make the initial request to my ProductServlet, the List of products returned do not have the imagebyte[] attribute retrieved until I explicitly call product.getImage Im assuming thats how lazy load works. p  pThat way, the initial call to the backend database to get the List of products is quicker, since all the byte[] data is not returned, and then when I only get the byte[] image portion when I need to get the imagesusing the ImageServlet.p  pI tried to set the lazy fetch attribute on my byte[] image attribute, but it said that was not allowed, Im guessing because its a standard Java class, and not an abstract class that I defined myself.p

Negative 522 pI am trying to develop an Active Appearance model using the VOSM package a hrefhttpwww.visionopen.comdownloadsopensourcesoftwarevosm relnofollowhttpwww.visionopen.comdownloadsopensourcesoftwarevosma. Im on Ubuntu 13.10 64b and use OpenCV2.4.8, Boost1.55 and VOSM0.33.p  pI have successfully trained the model using facial databases, and have the trained data stored in a subfolder. When I try to test the AAM fitting on some test images, there are no saved files, but the terminal output indicates the fitting process has completed properly.p  pCommand codetestsmfitting o traineddata t AAMBASIC i imagestest2 r true s truecodep  poutputp  precodedetection times  5 Average Interation Times  0 Averaget Detection time in ms  0 codepre  pThere are output folders created named after the .jpg files, but they are empty. How do I solve thisp
Negative 522 pI know this is a simple question, but I just cant seem to figure out what Im doing wrong. Im supposed to write a program that is like a lottery. One array contains 5 random numbers, and the other contains 5 numbers selected by the user. I use bubble sort to organize the numbers, and then try comparing the two arrays. When I run the program it always says the user is a winner, even if they didnt even get a single number correct. Ive tried for loops, while loops, ifelse, and I dont know where im going wrong. If you could please show me where im going wrong, or at least lead me in the right directionp  precodeint main       Variables     int winningNumbers[5]       int numbersToPlay[5]       bool winner  true      stdrandomdevice rd  obtain a random number from hardware     stdmt19937 engrd  seed the generator     stduniformintdistributionltgt distr1, 40  define the range      for int i  0 i lt 5 i              winningNumbers[i]  distreng       generate random lotto numbers       sort lotto numbers low to high     bubbleSortwinningNumbers       prompt user to select numbers to play     cout ltlt Input 5 numbers [140]      for int i  0 i lt 5 i              cin gtgt numbersToPlay[i]            sort played numbers     bubbleSortnumbersToPlay       check for winner     int index  0     while index lt 5              if numbersToPlay[index]  winningNumbers[index]                      winner  true             index                  else                      winner  false             break                    if winner  true         cout ltlt Winner ltlt endl     else         cout ltlt Not a winner... ltlt endl  return 0  codepre
Negative 522 pSo Im having trouble with an application Ive been working on and I only saw one other post with the 1 error and doesnt seem to help me with what is going on.  We have an items tab that when you click on a consignor, it should display the items and it does, but it spits out this error and sometimes doesnt update.p  pErrorp  precode   Exception in thread

Negative 522 pIm currently using composer to manage my projects dependencies on my development environment and it works wonders, however Im a bit lost when I deploy to production because many of my projects share quite a few of dependencies Symfony, Doctrine, log4php ... and I feel silly uploading them over and over and over again. Is there any way to configure symphony to use a central destination or something like thatp  pI already tried changing the destination directory to a shared directory, and tried configuring a couple of projects there, but composer deletes unused packages.p

Negative 522 pSo I have this weird problem that is bugging me for a few days now. Im making a new theme for a magento shop, the design asks me to create a different layout for the main category page and a sub category page. p  pThe normal way of doing this is to create or use a other layout in the backoffice Catalog  Manage Categories  ...  Custom Design  Page Layout. However, the subcategory page keeps using the layout set in the main category. Use Parent Category Settings is off on the main category, however this option is not available in the sub category. I tried using the normal layouts to start with, main category on 1 column, sub category on 2 column, but it just keeps loading the 1 column on the sub category page. I also tried setting a default layout in a local.xml file and keeping the page layout option empty for the sub category, that doesnt work either.p  pSome other info, Im using Magento 1.9 with the new RWD theme as base. Hoping someone can help me with this.p
Negative 522 pI am trying to make one activity that will have a specific text and image based on what button was clicked in the previous activity. The first activity is a page with a bunch of different image buttons of different aquatic plants. Depending on which image button is clicked, I want the text and image of the next activity to be a description of the plant and a picture of it. p  pThe question I have is how do I let the plant information activity know which button was clicked so that it knows which text and image to displayp  pA generic answer will work so I dont think youll need any of my code, but if you feel you need it, then Ill post it.p

Active and working are the buttons of the menu but not the ones shown in the main view.p  precodepublic class MyActivity extends Activity   DBAdapter db  new DBAdapterthis Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymy     if savedInstanceState  null          getFragmentManager.beginTransaction                 .addR.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment                 .commit          getWindow.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON      try          String destPath  datadata  getPackageName  databasesWizardDB         File f  new FiledestPath         if f.exists              CopyDBgetBaseContext.getAssets.openWizardDB,                     new FileOutputStreamdestPath               catch FileNotFoundException e          e.printStackTrace      catch IOException e          e.printStackTrace          new LongOperation.execute  codepre  pAnd the Activity that is opened by the menup  precode       package com.example.frank.myapplication             import android.app.Activity         import android.content.Intent         import android.database.Cursor         import android.os.Bundle         import android.view.KeyEvent         import android.view.Menu         import android.view.MenuItem         import android.view.View         import android.view.WindowManager         import android.widget.AdapterView         import android.widget.ArrayAdapter         import android.widget.Button         import android.widget.EditText         import android.widget.ListAdapter         import android.widget.ListView         import android.widget.TextView         import android.widget.Toast             import org.w3c.dom.Text             import java.util.ArrayList         import java.util.List  public class showgames extends Activity       private ListltStringgt listSpielId      DBAdapter db  new DBAdapterthis          Override          protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              getWindow.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON             super.onCreatesavedInstanceState             setContentViewR.layout.showgames             Intent EingabeName  getIntent             Intent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP              String[] favoriteTVShows             ListltStringgt list  new ArrayListltStringgt             listSpielId  new ArrayListltStringgt             db.open             Cursor cdb.getAllRecords             if c.moveToFirst                              do                      String Beendet                     String Ort                     if c.getInt91 BeendetgetStringR.string.beendet else     BeendetgetStringR.string.offen                      if c.getString10  null ampamp c.getString10.isEmpty                          Ortc.getString10                                            android.text.format.DateFormat.formatdd.MM.yyyy hhmm, c.getLong2                     String Spielandroid.text.format.DateFormat.formatdd.M.yy kmm,c.getLong2  Ortc.getString3 c.getString4 c.getString5 c.getString6 c.getString7 c.getString8Beendet                     list.addSpiel                     listSpielId.addc.getString0                   while c.moveToNext              else                   TextView Zuruecksetzen1  TextView findViewByIdR.id.Spieleanzeigen                 Zuruecksetzen1.setTextgetStringR.string.Spielwaehlenleer                 Button ButtonLoeschen  Button findViewByIdR.id.ButtonDatenloeschen                 ButtonLoeschen.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE                            String[] favoriteTVShows  Pushing Daisies, Better Off Ted,                     Twin Peaks, Freaks and Geeks, Orphan Black, Walking Dead,                     Breaking Bad, The 400, Alphas, Life on Mars,Pushing Daisies, Better Off Ted,                     Twin Peaks, Freaks and Geeks, Orphan Black, Walking Dead,                     Breaking Bad, The 400, Alphas, Life on Mars               The ListAdapter acts as a bridge between the data and each ListItem              You fill the ListView with a ListAdapter.

Negative 522 pId like to create an app that can temporarily swap the XYZ device sensors axes such as the gyroscope, compass, accelerometer, etc. i.e. make the device believe that X axis is Z, north is south, right is left, up is down, etc....

Negative 522 pI am working on a program which exhaustively searches a large number of permutations and runs a test on each one to accumulate stats based on the category each item qualifies for.p  pThe search input is generated on the fly using a method which returns an IEnumerable with a yield return so its not accumulating the entire dataset at once, rather, its generating it as its consumed.p  pThis works just fine for smallish search spaces but when I get into the hundreds of billions of records to check the process of generating the test cases almost immediately exhausts the 16GB of RAM on my machine and just starts thrashing the computer with page faults before any processing can begin.p  pWhat appears to be happening is that the Parallel.ForEach is greedily attempting to enumerate the entire input set before starting to process anything.p  pSo, my question is, how do I limit the rate at which the Parallel.ForEach requests input data from my test case generatorp  pIve tried using the ChunkPartitioner in the a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comParExtSamples relnofollowSamples for Parallel Programming with the .NET Frameworka with the idea that maybe the ForEach would stop asking for more partitions when it had fully saturated the thread pool with work but that does not appear to be the case.p  pI have tried searching all over the internet for an explanation of how Parallel.ForEach consumes input and ways I can influence this process but I cant find anything other than ways to partition the input set.p  pAm I just approaching this problem wrong  Is there an alternative pattern that would work better for this type of problemp

Negative 522 pI have written some VBA code to take data from an extract called Master Plan, and populate it into a sheet caleld Master Plan extract, the code then inserts a column which contains a formula that finds entries that it wants to keep or delete as not all the entries are needed.  The code below does the trick, but it takes a very long time to complete, and sometimes even manages to hang excel all together.  p  pI suspect it has something to do with the excessive conditional looping as it mostly hangs on the loops where I have added commentary.

I know that the Invoke method is executed synchronously so the main thread pauses while its being invoked and that if I use BeginInvoke the main thread can continue, but the fact real problem is that the dispatcher never executes the code and thats why everything halts. If I use BeginInvoke I will get problems later on when I try to set the progressbar to a value that is larger than the maximum. p  pIve tried different dispatcher priorities. I have a feeling that something is up with my parameter, but i really cant understand what.  p  pAny help greatly appreciated, because Im going out of my mindp  pEdit for some reason after I fiddled with DispatcherPriority everthing started working.  I am even back to ivoking the dispatcher without that argument and it still works.  Any ideas why this could be happening are still very welcome since I dont know why it works now and not before and this makes me feel that the code is realy unreliable. p

Negative 522 pIm having a hard time getting the right duration and the exact framerate in Jcodec. p  pMy situation is I have a app that shows an array of bitmaps, wherein the user can change its frame rate like 1fps, 5fps, 32fps, all I did was 1000fps. so 1fps will show 1 bitmap every 1 second, 2fps 2bitmap and so on, in short the user is the one that supplies the frame rate.I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20221836androidjcodechowtosetframeratethisa but I cant get the right formula to it. p  pAnd another thing, about the duration. What if I want 1fps and I have 16 bitmaps. JCodec should produce a 16 seconds video. p  pHow can I achieve that lets say that the bitmaps will be dynamic. Base on what I understand, Jcodec relies on hard coded duration. not by the number of frames it has encoded and converted to MP4. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 522 pTLDR Should the server return just HTTP codes that the client uses to construct error messages, or should the server return an error model to the client with the error message already in itp  pFull versionp  pIm working on a RESTbased web application with jQuery, and my team routinely goes back and forth on this question. If an error occurs on the server, I see two primary options to output an error to the userp  ol liThe client makes an AJAX call to the server, which results in an error in server code. The error is caught, and the server returns a specific HTTP code to the client. In the AJAX error handler, the client switches on specific error codes, and displays a friendly error depending on the code encountered. Thered obviously be a default error as well if no expected code is encountered.li liThe client makes an AJAX call to the server, which results in an error in server code. The error is caught, and the server constructs an error model to be returned in the client. When constructing the model, in addition to other pieces of pertinent information, the server includes a friendly error message. In the AJAX error handler, the client reads the error model and prints out the error message it finds.li ol  pPrimary difference between the two is where the error message displayed to the user originates. Whats the best practice Is one of these options it, or is there something different entirelyp  pThanks.p

Negative 522 pI am very new to Python, very new to the Twitter API, and not sure which Ive messed up here which is making it hard to research a solution. p  pIve made a simple twitter bot which queries the mentionstimeline, and responds to atreplies with one of a predetermined list of responses sorry in advance for the emojis. The problem is that every time it runs it responds to all the most recent atreplies, whether or not theyve already been replied to. p  pIve tried to get round this by writing the most recent mention ID the bot has replied to to a file, and passing that value to the sinceID of the mentionstimeline the next time the script is run. As far as I understand, the bot should then only see tweets it hasnt responded to, but instead it sees the most recent atreplies, including those its already replied to. p  pI get the same results whether or not I increment the mention ID by 1 before running the query  I thought maybe sinceID was inclusive, but it appears to make no difference. Essentially sinceID seems to have zero effect on what the query returns. p  pIm not sure what to do  I dont know if the problem is in how Ive passed the value to the Twitter API, or if theres an error in my code.

I have no problem using them in most cases but for some reason it outputs an integer value to the editText when I mix Strings with an integer for example if I dop  precodeeditText.setTextR.string.xplays  j codepre  pwhich I want to display X Plays 3 to the GUI however it displays a large integer to the GUI. If I do this without j which is an integer it is fine.p  precodeeditText.setTextR.string.xplays codepre  pThis just displays the string X Plays . p  pSo the problem is obviously trying to concatenate  an integer with an R.string but I dont know how to work around this. I have tried using stringBuilder and adding in empty strings  around the R.string and integer but similar results are returned. How can I fix thisp

Negative 522 pI have to admit that I didnt have the luck to use JPA, so If my question will sound weird please dont blame me. AFAIK Hibernate seems to be a wide spread implementation of JPA. The question is Are there any cases where importing Hibernate can be avoided My boss said that we havent to overhead our project with external things and could implement the necessary features of JPA ourselves. But almost everybody says that reinventing the wheel is just senseless and recommend to use ready implementations of JPA. Now Im a bit confused and dont know what is the best way to go.p

Negative 522 pIm new to Java and Android development, but have programming experience in other areas, e.g. C. Having read Herb Schildts Java A Beginners Guide, 6th Edition, i noticed that Java, as a language, has some serious flaws to my taste, for example, it doesnt provide a convenient support of the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization relnofollowRAIIa idiom, and the Oracles approach to that problem via the trywithresources statement is not supported by the official development tools from Google. And while some syntactic sugar such as lambdas could be enabled with help of some 3rd party tools, Androids version of Java is still far behind what Oracle offers.p  pOn the other hand, there exist tools like the a hrefhttpgroovy.codehaus.org relnofollowGroovya programming language, which promises virtually the same possibilities as what Java developers have, but in a better and more convenient way. Moreover, it now officially supports development for Android and requires JVM 1.6, which supposedly means that even the most recent features of Groovy could be used on any version of Android.p  pNow, given all the above, the question is is there anything bad about skipping Java and using Groovy as a primary Android development tool I want to emphasize that its not a question about subjective matters and tastes. Its more like does using Java for Android development bring any unique knowledge or experience thats otherwise impossible to acquire when using any other programming languagep  pJust to make sure i understand the possible drawbacks of using a 3rd party instrument instead of the canonical one, i.e. more chance to encounter bugs not related to Android, getting used to tools and techniques that may not be used by other Android developers, possible job search difficulties etc. Its something i could accept if Groovy delivers on its promise to be better than Java in almost any aspect. emBut is there any aspect that makes using Java for Android development absolutely crucial and irreplaceableemp  pThanksp

Negative 522 pSo this is the third time Ive tried to upload the same binary to iTunes Connect, the only major difference I tweaked a couple of small things being that Ive added the iAd Framework AND the GoogleAdMobs framework.p  pIts all working perfectly both on my simulator and on my Phone. The ads show up exactly at the point I want them to show up. First, Apple rejected my update because they couldnt locate the ads. So I sent them a video, pictures and a thorough description of how to find the ads.  They just rejected it now because apparently p  precodePLA 3.3.12  We found that your app uses the iOS Advertising Identifier but does not include ad functionality.  codepre  pEven though Im pretty certain Google AdMobs does use the AdIdentifier, nop  pThis is how I do it in my viewDidLoad, I put thisp  precode    ifmodeHorsLigne  NO     requestingAd  NO     [self showFullScreenAd]     admobInterstitial  [[GADInterstitial alloc] init]     admobInterstitial.adUnitID  MY ID     GADRequest request  [GADRequest request]     request.testDevices  [ GADSIMULATORID ]     [admobInterstitial loadRequestrequest]  codepre  pThen, I have thisp  precodevoidshowFullScreenAd  if requestingAd  NO      interstitial  [[ADInterstitialAd alloc] init]     interstitial.delegate  self     NSLogAd Request     requestingAd  YES  codepre  pp  precodevoidinterstitialAdADInterstitialAd interstitialAd didFailWithErrorNSError error      requestingAd  NO     NSLogAd didFailWithERROR     NSLog, error     if [admobInterstitial isReady]          [admobInterstitial presentFromRootViewControllerself]       codepre  pThe point being that if the iAD call fails, it loads the AdMob interstitial.p  pAm I doing something wrong Its all working perfectly on my Phone and on the simulator yet the app keeps on getting rejected..p  pThanks a lotp
Negative 522 pI am trying to understand when to use the virtual DOM concept and when not to. After reading the following answer on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma281994794584825httpstackoverflow.coma281994794584825a I have got an impression that the virtual DOM is to be used only when we want to refresh the entire DOM tree. Is that true p  pBecause take the following code snippetp  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt ltdiv idagtHelloltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pNow if I want to replace the content of the codedivcode with say emWorldem. I would write something likep  precodedocument.getElementByIda.innerHTML  World codepre  pIn this mirrors typical AJAX scenarios where only part of the page is refreshed. How would the virtual DOM help me in this case  Anyways I am targeting a specific element or set of elements, so what difference does it make that whether I am using a virtual DOM or the real DOM  p

Negative 522 pIve been researching popup menus see a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms647626vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms647626vvs.85.aspxa and a bit confused at what they are behind the scenes.p  pThey act partially like windows, but look like controls. For instance, they pop up above other elements, steal focus, and can go outside their parent container which makes me think they are a type of window. But they pass back an HMENU handle instead of a window handle, and they have no title bar, nor handles, nor show up in the task bar.p  pIf they are a type of control, how can they go outside their parent windowp  pIf they are a type of window, can I use windowspecific functions on them or if they are a control in a new window, is there a way to get a win handle to that new windowp  pCan I get the location of the popup menu for another applicationp

Negative 522 pI am facing a problem while developing my program. I have a codeQAbstractListModelcode which contain a codeboolecode property, and I want to be able to pass that value to my QML file containing a codeCheckBoxcode.p  pI found a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions23860270bindingcheckboxcheckedpropertywithacobjectqpropertythis question on StackOverflowa covering the same problem. I am facing the exact same problem but the question and answer cover the case where the property is sent to the qml through a codeQPROPERTYcode whereas I use a codeQAbstractListmodelcode. I have overridden the codesetDatacode, codedatacode and codeflagscode methods and all works fine but I have a button that checkuncheck all my codeCheckBoxcodees and if the user directly check one of them that one will not be editable through my checkuncheck button.p  pSo basically, I want to know how to set up a bidirectional binding using a codeQAbstractListModelcode instead of a codeQPROPERTYcode.p  pThank you.p

Negative 522 pSo heres the thing. I recently updated a web project to use nuget for its dependencies, which in turn updated all of those dependencies to the latest versions.p  pQuite a task as there were some breaking changes, but I have the thing running locally perfectly.p  pWe use TeamCity to pull the solution from bitbucket and deploy it the the local iis folder on a development staging server.p  pAfter a build, the website seems very poorly, first off it complainsp  blockquote   pCould not load file or assembly   fileCwebDev.Pegfect.Presentationbinmscorlib.dll or one of   its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an   incorrect format.p blockquote  pWhich is strange since my local copy does not have a copy of mscorlib in its web bin folder. Should be using the GAC If I remove the dll, I get a new error some NHibernate issue complaining about reflection. I havent pursued that since it all seems environmental.p  pIf I copy my local bin folder over the server web bin, it starts to run ok albeit extremely slowly relative to how it used to.p  pSo, the question what have you tried  i am currently installing VS 2012 onto the server and will try building the project from source directly. I am also considering updating TeamCity from v7 to v9.p  pI could also try to reinstall IIS8.0 on the server.p  pThese are desperate, blind shots in the dark. What would you tryp  pFWIW the project is targeting .NET 4.5.1 ANY CPUp
Negative 522 pI have a client application that consumes a number of web services through SSLTLSTunnels. I am trying to test handling and support for specific SSLTLS versions and possible fallbacks.p  pIs there a lightweight tool which lets me set up a secure endpoint for which I can set the supported versions and ciphersuites manually in a config file for example. I have been testing the WS functionality in SoapUI, but it does not offer to set the versions or ciphersuites for accepted SSLTLS connections, therefore I am trying to test the tunnel by itself with another tool.p  pe.g.  my client is set to TLS 1.0 with ONLY [TLSECDHERSAWITHAES128CBCSHA] mock server accepts only TLS 1.1 and higher expected result handshake failurep  pAny feedback is appreciatedp
Negative 522 pI have a registration form where the user adds their codepostcodecode and by sending a codeGETcode request to an API, I receive and show the codeaddresscode in the fields below.p  pMy problem is that I am currently using codeonchange getAddressthis.valuecode in the formtag itself however I would like to implement it using a jQuery event handler. This is how my code within the codeltscriptgtcode tag at the bottom of the page looks like p  precodevar getAddress  functionpostcode      .ajax         url lt getaddressurl gt,         dataType script,         type GET,         data  postcode postcode       document.readyfunction      dooo     this.onchange, input, dooo     var p  inputjobseekerpostcode     this.onchange, inputjobseekerpostcode, getAddressp.val   codepre  pThe codedoocode function is declared in my .js files and the event handler managing it works like a charm. However I dont manage to get the postcode thingsecond event handler in the code to run. What I have figured out is that the value of the field is not properly retreived, as no matter what I fill in, I get a codefailed responsecode from the API  the codevaluecode that I am passing is codecode. p  pFYI the codedoocode function implements a codejQuery UIcode progress bar which loads based on how many fields are filled in.p

Negative 522 pso here is my predicament i cannot seem to find this anywhere on the internet. My question is simple. I am creating a game app for android. The game will generate random circles on the screen that a user can click on then once the user does click on one of these random circles an action will occur. This is just like the function of the button, but different because the whole circle will be able to be clicked. I will post the random number generator that generates the circles. This is not the main class this is a separate class that extends view. I have attempted to do this below in the onTouchEvent method, but now i get errors in the logcat i have posted those below as well a long with the main class. please i feel as if i am very close to finding a solution to this problem. if anyone could tell me what i am doing wrong in this class that would be very helpful thanks everyonep  precodepublic class DrawingView extends View     public

Negative 522 pSay if you have a 2 identical arrays of n elements say with numbers from 1 to 10. You randomly pick an item from each array and check if they match. For one iteration the right match can be 10,10 or 3,3 as it randomly changes every time. Since both the arrays have 10 elements, getting the right match overall is very infrequent, if you pick a random number from each array. So each time, a specific weight can be assigned to the right match to increase this frequency. My question is how much weight do you assign the right match so it is more frequent but still seems random enough How do you decide thisp
Negative 522 pThis is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma120298101247334this questiona. If you review the accepted answer to that post, youll see that it does work, for that scenario. Well, now my scenario has changed and Im yet again stuck with this.p  pIm trying to figure out how to have this random with same start slide work if the slide images were not surrounded by codehrefcode tags.p  pFortunately, the structure skitter allows for is more flexible than it used to be. We can now simply leave out the codehrefcode tags and just use the codeimgcode, but in doing so, that kills the hackmod from the previous post. p  pSo, is there a way to use this [initial] magic in a class or some other way that wouldnt interfere with any other featuresp  pImportant note I also discovered that the replace option in this hackmod to get rid of the initial out of the link does not work any more in the newer versions. So though the function of having a constant slide be the start and the rest random does work, but if you try to utilize that slide as a link to anything, the link has the [initial] in it, which thusly kills the link.p  pIm using Skitter version 4.2.3 and jQuery 2.1.1.p  pIdeally, this feature could be more flexible and not rely on, nor interfere with, the codehrefcode option.p

Negative 522 pLink to the problem can be found stronga hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengestaxicabdriversproblemhereastrongp  blockquote   pProblem Statementp      pBurger Town is a city that consists of N special junctions and N1   pathways. There is exactly one shortest path between each pair of   junctions. Junction i is located at xi,yi and the distance between   two junctions i,j is defined by the Taxicab geometry.p      pTim has recently afforded a taxicab to work as a taxicab driver. His   vehicle was very cheap, but has a very big flaw. It can only drive H   units horizontally and V units vertically before refueling.p      pIf a customer wants to be brought from a junction i to another   junction j, then this car is only capable of driving the route, iff   the sum of horizontal distances and the sum of vertical distances on   this path are less than or equal to H and V respectively.p      pAlso, there is a unique path between any two junctions.p      pNow he has thoughts about returning the vehicle back to the seller.   But he first wants to know, if its even worth it. Thats why he wants   to know the number of unordered pairs i,j such that it is not   possible to drive a customer from junction i to junction j.p      pConstraintsp      p2  N  105p      p0  H,V  1014p      p0  xi,yi  109p blockquote  pI have solved this problem with recursion.

Negative 522 pAngular 2 is coming pretty soon. And I was wandering if there is already some good naming convention for new componentslibraries that are being created. p  pFor angular version 1 things have been called as codengsomethingcode or modules were called codeangularlibrarynamecode. Is the naming going to stay the same I think there should be some convention to avoid any confusion with old modules.p  pMaybe this question could serve as a good reference point for future naming guide of angular 2 libraries.p

Negative 522 pI was writing simple app for data deletion in db with some command line interface. As it got bigger, I decided to split it into two maven submodules one cli, one for db operations. Everything worked properly with one codeapplicationContextcode loaded within codeMaincode method. p  pAfter change, I left at least I would like to the spring only in the db module. This module has one public interface with four implementations. If it will be included into other project, I do not want to manually load the application context of that db module in other one not sure if it is even possible. I simply want to have a codejarcode which could be used on the go  just add to the pom.xml and thats all. On the other hand I do not know how to initialize this context within submodule. Is it possible, or should I ask, is my pattern a good one p  pI know there exists codeContextConfigurationcode annotation, but according to the documentation it is for integration tests.p

Negative 522 pSo what my code does right now is it creates a deck of cards using an emulated stack since I could not figure out how to implement a real stack in c.The cards are then shuffled, and then the deck is split in half and passed to two players, p1 and p2. Then the user is allowed a peek at p1s cards, which are numbered from 1 to 26, and the user can select a number from 1 to 26 to choose that card and put it into play.p  pI basically have to have code that goes through p1s cards, sees if the card you chose is equal to a card in p1s stack of cards, and if theyre equal, then I need to set that element equal to NULL. Only problem is p1s array consists of chars and ints because it is an array of structs. Otherwise, setting things to NULL would not be a problem.p  pAfter I get that specific element that you chose equal to NULL, I then have to push all of the elements after that NULL element, one space forward, so something likep  precodep1[x]  p1[x1]  codepre  pHere is the beginning of my code where the struct is and where main isp  precodestruct Card   char suit[10]   int number   void playGameCard p1[], Card p2[] void fillDeckCard deck void fillPlayerDeckCard deck[], Card p1[], Card p2[] void printDeckCard deck[], Card p1[], Card p2[] void shuffleDeckCard deck void throwCardCard p1[], Card p2[], Card p1cardsThrown[], Card p2cardsThrown[] string toStringCard p1[], Card p2[], Card p1New[], Card p2New[]  int main int argc, char argv[]    Card deck[52]    Card p1[26]    Card p2[26]    Card p1New[26]    Card p2New[26]    Card p1cardsThrown[26]    Card p2cardsThrown[26]    fillDeckdeck    shuffleDeckdeck    fillPlayerDeckdeck, p1, p2    printDeckdeck, p1, p2    throwCardp1, p2, p1cardsThrown, p2cardsThrown    playGamep1, p2, p1cardsThrown, p2cardsThrown    codepre  pAnd here is the problem code, my throwCard functionp  precodevoid throwCardCard p1[], Card p2[], Card p1cardsThrown[], Card p2cardsThrown[]    printfnWhich of your cards would you like to playn    int i  0    fori i lt 26 i       printfd d of sn, i, p1[i].number, p1[i].suit        int cardNumber    cin gtgt cardNumber    printfYou chose d the d of s, cardNumber, p1[cardNumber].number, p1[cardNumber].suit      HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING    check which card was thrown, then move that card out of array    forint x  0 xlt26 x       ifp1[cardNumber].number  p1[x].number          ifp1[cardNumber].suit  p1[x].suit             p1[cardNumber].number  NULL             p1[cardNumber].suit  NULL             forint y  x y lt 26 y                ifp1[y].number  NULL                   ifp1[y].suit  NULL                      p1[y]  p1[y  1]                      printfThis is P1s new deck                      printfd d of sn, x, p1[x].number, p1[x].suit                                                                          codepre  pAnd here are the exact errors I am receivingp  precodeEgyptianRatScrew3.cpp In function void throwCardCard, Card, Card, Card EgyptianRatScrew3.cpp5433 error invalid array assignment           ifp1[cardNumber].suit  p1[x].suit                                   EgyptianRatScrew3.cpp5535 warning converting to nonpointer type int from NULL [Wconversionnull]              p1[cardNumber].number  NULL                                     EgyptianRatScrew3.cpp5633 error incompatible types in assignment of long long int to char [10]              p1[cardNumber].suit  NULL                                   EgyptianRatScrew3.cpp5832 warning converting to nonpointer type int from NULL [Wconversionnull]                 ifp1[y].number  NULL                                  EgyptianRatScrew3.cpp5933 error incompatible types in assignment of long long int to char [10]                    ifp1[y].suit  NULL                                   codepre

Negative 522 pI have been coding in Flash for a while, though I havent worked a whole lot on AIR Mobile yet.

Negative 522 pI have a fairly simple jaxrs application running on wildfly 9. It makes use of resteasy multipart form. It runs 100. Now I am trying to run the same application with wildfly swarm, but get a javax.ws.rs.NotSupportedException Could not find message body reader for type .... multipartformdata on execute of the resource post operation. This as far as I understand is the resteasymultipartprovider. In my pom I have the wildflyswarmweldjaxrs fraction. Is this not suppose to take care of the multipart features If not how do I get it included in the swarm fat jarpackage I have tried including the resteasymultipartprovider as a compile dependency, but this breaks the swarm application and it refuses to startboot. Or have I missed something elsep
Negative 522 pCurrently I have CASTVariable AS varchar230. p  pI would like to add minimum and maximum precision. For example, the integers to the left of the decimal point in 1234567.89 should have a minimum of 1 but a maximum of five so the extra integers would be trimmed. In addition, Id like to do the same for scale  the decimals to the right, by setting a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of four. These numbers are just examples, the numbers will be updated dynamically.p  pFrom what Ive read I would have to set precision and scale somehow within typename in CAST, but Im not certain how to do that with multiple minimum and maximum of each. Im an Oracle noob, so Id appreciate any helpp

Something that seemed relevant that I picked from LogCat is below p  precode0729 143105.835 WSystem.err17696 java.lang.NullPointerException Attempt to invoke interface method java.lang.reflect.Type[]   java.lang.reflect.ParameterizedType.getActualTypeArguments on a null object reference 0729 143105.835 WSystem.err17696    at com.google.api.client.util.Types.java.lang.reflect.ParameterizedType getSuperParameterizedTypejava.lang.reflect.Type,   java.lang.ClassTypes.java      boolean isAssignableToOrFromjava.lang.Class,java.lang.ClassTypes.java      java.lang.Object newInstancejava.lang.ClassTypes.java     IllegalArgumentException handleExceptionForNewInstancejava.lang.Exception,java.lang.ClassTypes.java     boolean isArrayjava.lang.reflect.TypeTypes.java     java.lang.Class getRawClassjava.lang.reflect.ParameterizedTypeTypes.java     reflect.Type getBoundjava.lang.reflect.WildcardTypeTypes.java     resolveTypeVariablejava.util.List,java.lang.reflect.TypeVariableTypes.java     Class getRawArrayComponentTypejava.util.List,java.lang.reflect.TypeTypes.java     reflect.Type getActualParameterAtPositionjava.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.Class,intTypes.java     Iterable iterableOfjava.lang.ObjectTypes.java     Object toArrayjava.util.Collection,java.lang.ClassTypes.java 0729 143105.836 WSystem.err17696    at com.google.api.client.util.Types.java.lang.reflect.Type getIterableParameterjava.lang.reflect.TypeTypes.java 0729 143105.836 WSystem.err17696    at com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders.com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders cloneHttpHeaders.java     setjava.lang.String,java.lang.ObjectHttpHeaders.java     setAcceptEncodingjava.lang.StringHttpHeaders.java     setAuthorizationjava.util.ListHttpHeaders.java     setContentLengthjava.lang.LongHttpHeaders.java     void addHeaderjava.util.logging.Logger,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.lang.StringBuilder,com.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpRequest,java.lang.String,java.lang.Object,java.io.WriterHttpHeaders.java     java.lang.String toStringValuejava.lang.ObjectHttpHeaders.java     void serializeHeaderscom.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.util.logging.Logger,com.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpRequestHttpHeaders.java     serializeHeadersForMultipartRequestscom.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.util.logging.Logger,java.io.WriterHttpHeaders.java     com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.util.logging.Logger,com.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpRequest,java.io.WriterHttpHeaders.java     fromHttpResponsecom.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpResponse,java.lang.StringBuilderHttpHeaders.java     fromHttpHeaderscom.google.api.client.http.HttpHeadersHttpHeaders.java     parseHeaderjava.lang.String,java.lang.String,com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeadersParseHeaderStateHttpHeaders.java     java.lang.Object parseValuejava.lang.reflect.Type,java.util.List,java.lang.StringHttpHeaders.java 0729 143105.836 WSystem.err17696    at com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders.com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders cloneHttpHeaders.java     setjava.lang.String,java.lang.ObjectHttpHeaders.java     setAcceptEncodingjava.lang.StringHttpHeaders.java     setAuthorizationjava.util.ListHttpHeaders.java     setContentLengthjava.lang.LongHttpHeaders.java     void addHeaderjava.util.logging.Logger,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.lang.StringBuilder,com.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpRequest,java.lang.String,java.lang.Object,java.io.WriterHttpHeaders.java     java.lang.String toStringValuejava.lang.ObjectHttpHeaders.java     void serializeHeaderscom.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.util.logging.Logger,com.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpRequestHttpHeaders.java     serializeHeadersForMultipartRequestscom.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.util.logging.Logger,java.io.WriterHttpHeaders.java     com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.lang.StringBuilder,java.util.logging.Logger,com.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpRequest,java.io.WriterHttpHeaders.java     fromHttpResponsecom.google.api.client.http.LowLevelHttpResponse,java.lang.StringBuilderHttpHeaders.java     fromHttpHeaderscom.google.api.client.http.HttpHeadersHttpHeaders.java     parseHeaderjava.lang.String,java.lang.String,com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeadersParseHeaderStateHttpHeaders.java     java.lang.Object parseValuejava.lang.reflect.Type,java.util.List,java.lang.StringHttpHeaders.java 0729 143105.836 WSystem.err17696    at com.google.api.client.http.HttpResponse.void ltinitgtcom.google.api.client.http.HttpRequest,com.google.api.client.http.

Negative 522 pI have jQuery Validator plugin and I need to have some AJAX validation method. First of all, I tried to use emremoteem, but as I understand it always sends the elements value and uses elements name. But what if I need some other parameter name instead of elements name This method can be applied to different form elements by class and I need to be sure that I will always send the same parameter with elements value. So, if I will have something like thisp  precodeltinput namezip1 classzip gt ltinput namezip2 classzip gt codepre  pand rule config like thisp  precoderemote httpexample.com codepre  pthen AJAX calls will be like strongexample.comzip1valuestrong and strongexample.comzip2valuestrong, while I need to have a specific parameter name.p  pAnother thing is I need to process the response and Im not sure how to do that with emremoteem.p  pSo currently Im thinking about creating custom method instead of using emremoteem, which will do an AJAX call with parameter name I want, then process the response and set the validation status.p  pIs there a better solutionp

Negative 522 pI am creating a gem that has to work with any possible combination of how the attributes on a Table would be configured  the specific case Im using it for is Feedback, so well use that in this examplep  pGiven the following itemp  precodeFeedback    id gt 1,   comments gt Works well,   recommendations gt Change this one thing  codepre  pI would have to extract the data as codeid 1, comments Works Well, recommendations Change this one thingcode, which if I know the particular fields Im dealing with is a no brainer.

Ive tried converting the item to a Hash, using the toparams method on it, and other typical tricks for grabbing both the keys and values in keyvalue pairs, but to no avail.p  pThanksp
