Positive 1603 pI have been researching how to perform URL rewrites on Tomcat 8 and keep running into the same two suggestions.p  p1 Use Tuckey URLRewriteFilter. 2 Run Apache on top of Tomcat to use modrewrite.p  pIn regards to the former, URLRewriteFilter doesnt appear to have any documentation about how to configure in a Java format as opposed to XML. My Spring MVC application does not make use of a web.xml file  all configuration is done via Java classes  and so Im not in a position to configure with XML. p  pIs there any way to configure in this way or are there any good alternatives other than trying to run Apache on top of Tomcatp  pFor example, is there a way to achieve this in Java as opposed to XMLp  precodeltfiltergt    ltfilternamegtUrlRewriteFilterltfilternamegt    ltfilterclassgtorg.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.UrlRewriteFilterltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtUrlRewriteFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt     ltdispatchergtREQUESTltdispatchergt     ltdispatchergtFORWARDltdispatchergt ltfiltermappinggt codepre

Positive 1603 pI need a docker container with Tomcat and ActiveMQ. I managed to do this with the usage of supervisord, and the container is working perfectly and all. But then I thought that the concept is bad, since I dont want to lose my activeMQ messages when I deploy a new war in Tomcat.  So I made 2 containers and linked them, one for activemq and one for tomcat.  I can see that tomcat is linked to activemq, but the deployed war in tomcat does nothing with activeMQ.p  pMy question is any tips how can I check why arent they communicating, even if the containers are linked, environments created and so onp  pAlso if someone could link a git hub repo where somebody is using tomcat with activemq linked from 2 different containersp  pAlso if some of you knows a good practice bloog, related to usage of activemq in docker, I am worried about the lost messages when recreating a container.p  pFrom my point of view a docker container is something which should be able to be build from an image in the exact same state. With active MQ this is a bit more tricky, I dont know exactly where does activemq save on the disk the messages, and if a shared volume will fix the persistence problem with docker. On the other hand you dont redeploy that often a container with activemq, but what if it will happen, host restart  destroying all containers.. what are the safety measuresp

Positive 1603 pMy company has a project with customer that we have to integrate OpenAM to current web Java app.p  pBasically, we have a Java web app run by Tomcat. The user authentication and authorization is check at the web app. Now we use OpenAm to handle all those things. So when we request a url on browser, it will redirect to OpenAm to check authentication and authorization. If successfully, it will redirect back to web app with user uid user id inside request header. The web app take the uid and get all user information from web app database.p  pWe use IIS web server, so we install IISconnector to connect IIS and Tomcat. And we also install IIS7 Web Policy Agency to connect IIS and OpenAm. And we have 2 big problems 1. After setup IIS, IIS7 Web Policy Agency, OpenAM, when we request a url, it cannot redirect to OpenAm to check authen and autho. The environment is Windows 7, IIS7 and IIS7 Web Policy Agency. 2. When we change to Apache instead of IIS, we install Apache Web Agency Policy, when request a url, it redirect to OpenAm, after login to OpenAM it redirect back to the Web App, but inside header, itve just have codeiplanetDirectorycode token in cookie, and dont have codeuidcode info in header.p  pTomorrow we will setup the development environment again, so i will give detail about the setting and the log.p  pThanks you a lot.p  pOpenAM a hrefhttpopenam.forgerock.orgdocs.html relnofollowenter link description hereap

We bolted on some new functionality recently and found that when we change the SQL Provider from SQLOLEDB.1 to SQLNCLI.1 some code that is trying to retrieve data from a table via a stored procedure fails.p  pThe table in question is pretty straightforward and was created via the following scriptp  precodeSET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO CREATE TABLE [dbo].[UAllergenText]     [TableKey] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [GroupKey] [int] NOT NULL,     [Description] [nvarchar]150 NOT NULL,     [LanguageEnum] [int] NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKUAllergenText] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED      [TableKey] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF,     IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY]  GO ALTER TABLE [dbo].[UAllergenText]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT  FKUAllergenTextUBaseFoodGroupInfo] FOREIGN KEY[GroupKey] REFERENCES [dbo].[UBaseFoodGroupInfo] [GroupKey] GO ALTER TABLE [dbo].[UAllergenText] CHECK CONSTRAINT  FKUAllergenTextUBaseFoodGroupInfo] codepre  pBascially four columns, with TableKey being an identity column and everything else is populated via the following scriptp  precodeINSERT INTO UAllergenText GroupKey, Description, LanguageEnum VALUES 401, Egg, 1 codepre  pwith a long list of other INSERT INTOs that follow the one above.  Some of the rows inserted have special characters like accent marks above letters in their descriptions.  I had originally thought that the inclusion of the special characters was part of the problem but if I completely clear out the table and then repopulate it with just the single INSERT INTO from above that has no special characters, it still fails.p  pSo I moved on...p  pThe data in this table is then accessed via the following codep  precodestdwstring wSPName  SPGETALLERGENDESC variantt  vtEmpty1 DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND, VTERROR variantt  vtEmpty2DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND, VTERROR  CommandPtr pCmd  daxLayerCDataAccessGetSPCommandpConn, wSPName  pCmdgtParametersgtAppendpCmdgtCreateParameterintGroupKey, adInteger, adParamInput, 0, varianttlongnGroupKey pCmdgtParametersgtAppendpCmdgtCreateParameterintLangaugeEnum, adInteger, adParamInput, 0, varianttintlanguage  RecordsetPtr pRS  pCmdgtExecuteampvtEmpty1, ampvtEmpty2, adCmdStoredProc              stdwstring wSQL  Lselect Description from UAllergenText WHERE GroupKey  401 AND LanguageEnum  1 RecordsetPtr pRS  daxLayerCRecordsetAccessGetRecordsetPtrpConn,wSQL  if pRSgtGetRecordCount gt 0      stdwstring wDescField  LDescription     daxLayerCRecordsetAccessGetFieldpRS, wDescField, nameString     else      nameString    codepre  pThe daxLayer is a third party data access library the application is using, though we have the source to it some of which will be seen below.

If the application creates a new row in that table and retrieves that row via stored procedure, it also works correctly unless you include a special character in the description in which case it correctly saves the row but blows up again in the exact same way as above upon retrieval of that row.p  pSo to summarize, if I can, rows put into the table via the INSERT script ALWAYS blow up the app when they are accessed by stored procedure regardless of whether they contain any special characters.  Rows put into the table from within the application by the user at runtime are retrieved correctly via stored procedure UNLESS they contain a special character in the Description, at which point they blow up the app.  If you access any of the rows in the table by using SQL from the code at runtime instead of the stored procedure it works whether there is a special character in the Description or not.p  pAny light that can be shed on this will be greatly appreciated, and I thank you in advance.p

Negative 1603 pWe are trying to emulate a POS keyboard in order to integrate an application with an existing Point of Sale application.p  pWe ran across this software a hrefhttpwww.fabulatech.comvirtualserialportkit.html relnofollowVirtual Serial Port Kitap  pIt basically creates a virtual serial port pair so that data send to COM1 can come out of COM4 and vice versa.  This allows our application to send data through COM4 to appear to the POS application that it is talking to a keyboard on COM1.p  pPretty ingenious, but it seems there is some kind of signalling going on that we are not able to replicate with the .Net System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class...p  pFrom what we can tell from serial port monitoring programs, this is how the startup sequence worksp  ol li8 byte Command sent to keyboardli liKeyboard beepsli liSome kind of signal is sent from the keyboardli liSecond 8 byte command is sent to keyboard, triggered by the signalli liKeyboard replies with device and version informationli ol  pWhen using our virtual serial port, we cannot figure out how to replicate the signal sent from the keyboard.

We have gotten a cable to run from the POS PC to another and can see data coming across to emulate the keyboard.  Now our problem is that we cant figure out how to signal that the keyboard is ready to recieve data as the top answer mentions. It appears that the POS application sends the command to beep an waits up to 3 seconds waiting for a signal.  So it times out when talking to our application, but not when talking to the real keyboardp  pHow can we do this with the SerialPort class  We already set DtrEnable and RtsEnable to true, do we need to set something else  Or do we have to use a lower level serial port pinvoke to accomplish thisp  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  precodeport.RtsEnabled  false Thread.Sleep1000 port.RtsEnabled  true codepre  pThis makes the POS application think the keyboard is plugged in, which makes sense.

Negative 1603 pstrongQuestion Summarystrongp  pIs there a better method than the one posted below to implement the databasecreation stage of an automated deploymentp  pstrongBackgroundRequirementsstrongp  ul lipI am in the process of attempting to develop a coherent database version control process using an approach similar to a hrefhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20080131versioningdatabasesthebaseline.aspx relnofollowthis onea.  This question is specifically about the embaselineem, which includes physically creating the database.pli lipThe plan  for now  is to implement a simple commandline tool in .NET to apply both the baseline and change scripts.  I want the tool to be generic we have several independent transactional databases, and therefore would like all scripts to be external, including database creation.pli lipThe test environments may not be a perfect replica of production physical file locations and sizes may need to be quite different.pli ul  pstrongCurrent Ideastrong What Im looking for feedback onp  pBasically a template system.  Use a simple codestring.Replacecode on a script like the followingp  precodeCREATE DATABASE [DBNAME] ON PRIMARY      NAME  NMyDBData,     FILENAME  NPRIMARYFILENAME,     SIZE  PRIMARYSIZEKB,     MAXSIZE  UNLIMITED,     FILEGROWTH  5 , FILEGROUP [FGMyDBIndex]      NAME  NMyDBIndex,     FILENAME  NINDEXFILENAME,     SIZE  INDEXSIZEKB,     MAXSIZE  UNLIMITED,     FILEGROWTH  5 ,  more filegroups ... LOG ON       NAME  NMyDBLog,     FILENAME  NLOGFILENAME,     SIZE  LOGSIZEKB,      etc.  GO  ALTER DATABASE [DBNAME] SET COMPATIBILITYLEVEL  100 GO   more ALTER DATABASE stuff ... codepre  pObviously, the tokens to be replaced are the ones like codeDBNAMEcode and codeLOGFILESIZEcode.  The values for these would be taken from commandline parameters or perhaps from an external file.p  pstrongProblems I see with this approachstrongp  ul lipThe script bills itself as a TSQL script but is in fact invalid TSQL.  It forces you to either use the deployment tool or perform a tedious manual searchandreplace.pli lipThere is no way to run it with default values.  Worse, it provides no indication of what a good default value would be.pli lipIt feels flimsy.  It seems like it would be possible to alter the script in such a way that it is still valid SQL or at least, as valid as it presently is but still break the deployment tool.  The lack of any escaping, for one, is concerning.  And template parameters within literal strings make my skin crawl.pli ul  pstrongOther possibilities that Ive consideredstrongp  ul lipConstruct a dynamic SQL script to be executed with codespexecutesqlcode.  This would provide the benefit of true parameters as opposed to a naive template, but would make the script incredibly cumbersome to write, test, and maintain, especially if we ever decide to take a new baseline which we might  its a big database.pli lipUse SSMS template parameters.  This decouples it nicely from the deployment tool but also makes it difficult to integrate with the deployment tool  kind of ties it to SSMS.pli lipEmbed the script in the deployment tool.  That way nobody can mess around with it, and its clear that the script is merely a template that must be processed.  Default values can be embedded somewhere close to the script.  The main, huge disadvantage is that the deployment tool becomes applicationspecific and might require code changes for something that really shouldnt require a code change.pli lipGenerate the entire script dynamically off an external, humanreadable file, like YAML.  At first this idea emseemedem very elegant, but eventually it started sinking in that I might be reinventing the wheel.  emEverythingem about the database would have to be included in the file, so does this really offer any advantage over manually modifying a plainvanilla SQL script or even creating the database manually through SSMSpli ul  pNone of these options seem quite right.  What I want is something thats emindependentem just as code is theoretically independent of the environment you use to build it, but also emreadableem no SQL within SQL, and emselfexplanatoryem clearly identifies what settings are needed and what good defaults might be.p  pAre there any methods that will achieve everything Im trying to achieve  Or am I just being too picky or looking at the problem the wrong wayp  pP.S. I am strongnotstrong presently looking for commercial, standalone, 3rdparty tools that will perform this task for me.  Now I have two problems.p

Negative 1603 pI have a codeJDialogcode that takes a name from the user. Behind the codeJDialogcode, is an applet. I dont want the user to access that applet until he has entered the name. I tried codeJDialog.setAlwaysOnToptruecode, but the applet throws an codeAccessExceptioncode error. So what I did was keep a while loop that will execute codeJDialog.setVisibletruecode till the codeJtextFieldcodeinput for user name is empty . But for some reason this works really slow, meaning the codeJDialogcode  loads, but it takes time to focus on the codeJTextFieldcode and even when the user types his name, it comes really slow... like one character in 2 seconds... Is there any other way for me to force the user to enter the name before accessing the appletp

Negative 1603 pThis is a followup question to the one I posted last week a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3065528ajaxactionlinkisnotpostingAjax.ActionLink not Postinga.  I did finally get it to Post, and it properly calls my Delete action and deletes the record.  The Delete method returns a RedirectToActionList so that the new data set minus the deleted record is relisted.  Except that what actually happens is  NOTHING.  The listing doesnt change. And Im pretty sure I know why calling Ajax.ActionLink returns an Ajax result which is only supposed to replace a designated element the UpdateTargetId option parameter in the document.  And since I havent designated any, it doesnt replace anything, even though its a whole fresh page.p  pMy question is, what do I pass to the AjaxOption.UpdateTargetId to get it to wipe the whole page and reload with the new result, just as though Html.ActionLink had been called recalling that the only reason for using Ajax.ActionLink was that I wanted the method invoked with a POST instead of a GET And since this page uses a Master Page, I dont have the option of just putting an ID on the body element.p

What Im attempting to do is have a single table with all the achievements and their base information name and description. Using that table and polymorphic associations, I want to link to other tables that will contain the criteria for completing that achievement, e.g. the WeightAchievement table will have the weight required and exercise id.  Then, a users progress will be stored in a UserProgress model, where it links to the actual Achievement as opposed to WeightAchievement.p  pThe reason I need the criteria in separate tables is because the criteria will vary wildly between different types of achievements and will be added dynamically afterwards, which is why Im not creating a separate model for each achievement.  p  pDoes this even make sense  Should I just merge the Achievement table with the specific type of achievement like WeightAchievement so the table is name, description, weightrequired, exerciseid, then when a user queries the achievements, in my code I simply search all the achievements e.g. WeightAchievement, EnduranceAchievement, RepAchievement, etcp

Id like to go from utf8 stdstring to stdwstring and back without losing information.p  pI think there may be some limitations with locales on Windows, but Im not particularly concerned about them. As long as the answer works on Linux and has no dependencies beyond libstdc i.e. no boost dependency, Im happy.p  pLinks to background information appreciated.p  pNOTE There seems to be some confusion. More than one char can represent a single character in UTF8, so functions that do not account for this when converting from wchart to char will not work.p

These attributes will vary from one webcontrol to another, and cannot be set globally in the codeltheadgtcode or codeltbodygtcode sections. For example, I might have two of my webcontrols on a single page, each with different CSS attributes set for all of their childimages.p  pAs a last resort, I can piece together a dynamic CSS class generator for these controls  but that would be a giant pain, with really sloppy results. Namely, each webcontrol would generate their own CSS class, write it in the codeheadcode or codebodycode sections somehow, all while making sure that multiple webcontrols arent using the same name for their CSS classes. Like I said, a giant sloppy mess  hence Id love to be able to cram all this information into the attribute tags for the individual controls, so they dont step on eachothers toes.p

Negative 1603 pWe are going to migrate an application to have it support Unicode and have to choose between unicode character set for the whole database, or unicode columns stored in N[VAR]CHAR2.p  pWe know that we will no more have the possibility of indexing column contents with Oracle Text if we choose NVARCHAR2, because Oracle Text can only index columns based on the CHAR type.p  pApart that, is it likely that other major differences arise when harvesting from Oracle possibilitiesp  pAlso, is it likely that some new features are added in newer versions of Oracle, but only supporting either CHAR columns or NCHAR columns but not bothp  pThank you for your answers.p  h3Note following Justins answerh3  pThank you for your answer. I will discuss your points, applied to our casep  pOur application is usually alone on the Oracle database and takes care of the data itself. Other software that connect to the database are limited to Toad, Tora or SQL developer.p  pWe also use SQLLoader and SQLPlus to communicate with the database for basic statements or to upgrade between versions of the product. We have not heard of any specific problem with all those software regarding NVARCHAR2.p  pWe are also not aware that database administrators among our customers would like to use other tools on the database that could not support data on NVARCHAR2 and we are not really concerned whether their tools might disrupt, after all they are skilled in their job and may find other tools if necessary.p  pYour last two points are more insightful for our case. We do not use many builtin packages from Oracle but it still happens. We will explore that problem.p  pCould we also expect performance breakage if our application that is compiled under Visual C, that uses codewchartcode to store UTF16, has to perform encoding conversions on all processed datap

As you know most a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd14520328vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowWindows GDIa works with codeHWNDcode to render graphics on screen, that is why I pass codeplayerHandlecode to codeProxPlayercode methods, as you can see above yourself. Window Forms codeUserControlcode defines a public property called codeHandlecode of type codeIntPtrcode which is equivalent to codeHWNDcode, so I pass that to codeProxyPlayercode methods. It solved my problem. But Silverlights codeUserControlcode doesnt have any such property. p  pSo my question basically is, how would I get handle to my silverlight control Because without it, I cannot call APIs from codePlayer.dllcode.

So please suggest me solution that fits in with my requirementp  pstrongNotestrong Assume that my silverlight application will always run on Microsoft Windows.

Negative 1603 pWhen one takes a nonlocalized XIB file in Xcode, and makes it localizable, it automatically adds the default regionlocalization to the XIB file, e.g. en or English. This actually emmovesem the XIB file into the emen.lprojem or emEnglish.lprojem directories. If the XIB file is in a version control system such as SVN, SVN starts to freak out because the file was not moved within the version control system, and it thinks that it is missing. What to do Is there a way to have Xcode move the XIB files in a version controlfriendly way, or do I need to move the files with the SVN commandprompt in Terminalp

Negative 1603 pI would like to create a dummy application for connecting my Android phone to my latop and printing out messages through the browser. Imagine twitter without any of the functionalityp  pFrom my thinking I will be using the followingp  pClient  Android Phone, application  Server  Latop, tomcat, servlet, browserp  pThe idea is the application will use WiFi to establish communication between the phone and the laptop, is it required for the android application to specify the use of the phones 3g or WiFi connection in the code. Would sockets be an appropriate choice for establishing a connection How would I go about defining the server to remain open and active looking for incoming connections from a mobile device with which to output the text communicated via a browser.p  pI am so vauge but I am assuming I would need to create the Android Application first, open a connection to the IP and Port of the laptop using a socket connection. Using buffer reader and printwriter communicate a users inputed text from the Android application to a servlet on the server side. Within the server a simple out.print to the browser should sufficep  pAny thoughts, guidance would be greatp

Negative 1603 pWe are development an announcement mechanism that works in such way  Users are nested attributes under an announcement.  Users emails are entered in the new announcement form as the nested attributes.  Would like to work this way  When the announcement is saved, it needs to search users email w current users emails, if found,  then deposit this announcement into that users profile and the user will be notified via email.  If NOT, then a new user account is created and an email is sent for the user to claim his account. When creating a new announcement, the rails saves all attributes tied wnested attributes this is great except when the users email already exists.  Since only users email is used to created the Users account, how can we implement password later on or auto create password to allow user to change later on  We are using devise for authentication.

Negative 1603 pI noticed I dont get any compiler errors when I accidentally forget to return from a function that is supposed to return a reference. I wrote some small tests to see what actually happens and I got more confused than anything.p  precodestruct Foo      int x      Foo          x  3        Foo foo  new Foo  Fooamp testbool flag      if flag         return foo  codepre  pIf emtestem doesnt explicitly return a value, I will still get something returned. However the emFooem object that is returned is not initialized using the default constructor mdash thats because emxem is different from 3 in the nonexplicitly returned value.p  pWhat is actually happening when you dont return a reference If this is a feature, is it safe to use it as a means to return dummy objects in case errors occur, as opposed to returning a null pointer.

Negative 1603 pI need some help with converting a python windows service using py2exe.p  pLet me explain the problem. I have a python service, which works, no problems here. I used py2exe to turn it into an executable file. I tested it by replacing the python version of the service with this one and it works with no problems too. p  pBut when I move the exe version of the service to another computer, it will register with the service manager but wont start with the error The system cannot find the file specified. The missing file is one of the modules Ive written.p  pI played with this a bit and went back to the machine where I used py2exe and where the exe version of the service works. I removed everything python related, everything py2exe created but the dist folder, everything I could think of that was related with the python version of the service. The exe version still worked altho I removed, amongst others, the very files that were supposedly missing on the other machine.p  pTried a bunch of different things but cant get the exe version to work. If any of you guys have any ideas, Id really appreciate it. p  pP.S I do have the c runtime installed on the target machine. You cant register the service without it and as I said, I can register it, it just wont run. p

Negative 1603 pI have an app that streams music using AudioStreamer class by Matt Gallagher. This works fine as a background process except I want to be able to skip to the next song once the stream is finished. Unfortunately this part doesnt work.

Negative 1603 pI just recently ran into some trouble setting up a fully automated nightly build  testing  deployment environment. To explain the setup in short. We use Mercurial as source control system and TeamCity as build server. It currently only has one build agent on a separate machine to keep things simple.p  pThe idea is as follows each night a TeamCity build runs. Pulls latest from Mercurial repository, runs a build, runs unit tests, deploys to test server, runs acceptance tests on build agent against freshly deployed test server and if all of that passes deploys the lot to a staging server. Ive got everything working except for acceptance tests. These are done with SpecFlow and WatiN. Everyhting runs nicely on development machines Windows 7 32 bit. However when I try to run the acceptance tests NUnit in TeamCity the runner reports fail beacuse of step [Browser].ContainsTextbrowserText. All steps up to that ran correctly and if I replicate the steps in the same browser on build agent got full admin access I can see the text being present. So to my best knowledge the test should pass.p  pI found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions679347watininvisualstudio2008secondtestmethodfailsstackoverflow threada that got me thinking I may be doing somwthing wrong with how I keep the browser instance around. To explain I have a set of common steps such as when I click X button or when I enter text X into field Y and the one with an issue then then I am shown X. Because Im making as much as possible of tests reusable Ive also generalized a requiresbrowser scenario requirement which is then defined like thisp  precode[BeforeScenariorequiresbrowser] public void RequiresBrowserBeforeFeature      Settings.MakeNewIeInstanceVisible  false     ScenarioContext.Current.SetltBrowsergtnew IEtrue   [AfterScenariorequiresbrowser] public void RequiresBrowserAfterFeature      ScenarioContext.Current.GetltBrowsergt.Close     ScenarioContext.Current.GetltBrowsergt.Dispose  codepre  pand then the common stepp  precode[ThenI am shown .] public void ThenIAmShownstring text      Assert.IsTrueScenarioContext.Current.GetltBrowsergt.ContainsTexttext  codepre  pFrom this I can define other common steps that enter text into text boxes, click buttons and so on. All this works perfectly on development environment, running in visual studio 2010 [as administrator].p  pAm I wrong in thinking that ScenarioContext should be preserved until the test is finishedp  pWhat Ive tried so farp  ol lipConfiguring build agent service to run as local system SYSTEM.

Negative 1603 pIm using the MD5 algorithm to hash the key for an ondisk hash table I know its questionable whether this is the best algorithm to use for this, but Im going with it for now. The problem is generalizable to any algorithm that produces a byte array. My problem is this p  pThe size of the hash code determines the number of combinations buckets in the hash table. Since MD5 is 128 bit, there are a huge number of combinations  3.4e38 which is way too big for my purpose. So what I want to do is pick off the first n bits of the byte array that MD5 produces, and convert those into a long or ulong value. Since MD5 produces a byte array, it would be easy to do if I wanted an integral number of bytes, but this leads to too big a jump in the number of combinations. Im finding the single bit version to be a lot trickier. p  pGoal p  precoden  10   I.e. I want 210 combinations long pos  someFcnbyte[] key, n codepre  pwhere key is the value being hashed, and n is the number of bits of the MD5 result I want to use. Pos, then, will be an integer from 0 to 1023 in the case of n  10. If n  11, the code will be from 0 to 2111  2027, etc. Has to be somewhat fastefficient. p  pDoesnt seem that hard but its eluding me. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks. p

Negative 1603 pGCC typically yields this warning when the proper header file is not included.  This link  a hrefhttpwww.networktheory.co.ukdocsgccintrogccintro19.html relnofollowwww.networktheory.co.ukdocsgccintrogccintro19.htmla says that because the function declaration is implicit rather than explicitly declared via a header the wrong argument types could actually be passed to the function, yielding incorrect results.  I dont understand this.  Does this mean the compiler generates code that pushes something, of the machines word size, onto the stack for the callee to consume, and hopes for the best  p  pDetail is appreciated.p

Negative 1603 pIs there any difference between AsyncSync being fired up from Activity or IntentServicep  pIm building an app which downloads and uploads files via http. I use custom notification layout with progress bar for each transfer. I choose between doing transfers in parallel or putting them into queue which option would you recommend.p  pFor the option with queue I use an IntentService, so Android framework takes care of putting tasks into a queue for me. For having them in parallel I use AsyncTasks. But I fire them up from IntentService could be Service as well  is there any point doing so IntentService is terminated right after it executes AsyncTask, so the AsyncTask runs without any parent.p  pWhat if I fired up those AsyncTask from Activity, go to the homescreen and system decided to close this Activity Can it do that Will the AsyncTask survive itp  pWhat would be the preferred approach for this casep

Negative 1603 pIm using mysql with django 1.3 and I have posts stored in a database.  The posts are stored for a certain amount of time, say 7 days.  How can I delete a post when the duration7 days is up  Im not asking how to delete, but more how to determine when to deletep  pI dont know if this is a good way of doing things, but one way Im considering doing this is when the user looks up a postquery sent and the duration is up, the post is deleted.  Also, when I do a search or browse and a list of posts if pulled from the database, Ill go through the list and delete the posts over the time limit.  What worries me about this implementation is when I pull a list, say ten posts, and 9 are over the time limit, I would have to get another list, and if there are posts over the limit in that list, I would have to get more .... etc. So one query could lead to a lot of queries and ultimately be very inefficient.  So is there a better way to do thisp  pOr maybe a whole better way of implementing thisp  pSo basically, how can I implement a system so that a user will never see a post that is past its durationp  pNot sure if I worded everything correctly, Im really confused on how to do this efficiently.p

Negative 1603 pI was reading a piece of code from the XStreamingReader library which seems like a really cool solution for being able to execute LINQ queries over XML documents but without loading the actual document into the memory like in an XDocument object and was wondering about the followingp  precodepublic IEnumerableltXElementgt Elements      using var reader  readerFactory              reader.MoveToContent         MoveToNextElementreader         while reader.EOF                      yield return XElement.Loadreader.ReadSubtree             MoveToNextFollowingreader                 public IEnumerableltXElementgt ElementsXName name      return Elements.Wherex gt x.Name  name  codepre  pRegarding the 2nd method codeElementsXNamecode  The method first calls Elements, and then use codeWherecode to filter its results, but im kind of intrigued about the order of executions in here since Elements contains a yield statement. From what I understand  Executing Elements returns an IEnumerable collection, this collection physically does not contain any items YET.  Where is executed on that collection, behind the scene theres a loop which iterates through every item, new items are Loaded on the fly, since yield is being used.  All items which matched the Where statement are returned as an IEnumerable collection, and are PHYSICALLY IN that collection.p  pFirst, am I correct with the above assumption Second, in case im right  what if I wanted to return a yielded collection rather than returning a collection which is filled up physically with all the filtered data  Im asking this because it loses the entire purpose of NOT reading an entire matching block into the memory, but iterating one matching element at a time...p

Negative 1603 pI made a set of XMLRPC clientserver programs in python and set up a little method for authenticating my clients. However, after coding pretty much the whole thing, I realized that once a client was authenticated, the flag I had set for it was global in my class i.e. as long as one client is authenticated, all clients are authenticated. I dont know why, but I was under the impression that whenever SimpleXMLRPCServer was connected to by a client, it would create a new set of variables in my program. p  pBasically the way its set up now isp  precodeclass someclass     authenticateself, username, pass         do something here         ifcheckforauthenticationusername, pass              self.authenticatedTrue     otheractionself, vars         if authenticated             do whatever         else             return Not authorized.  serverSimpleXMLRPCServer.SimpleXMLRPCServer0.0.0.0, 8000 server.registerinstancesomeclass server.serveforever codepre  pI need either a way to hack this into what I am looking for i.e. the authenticated flag needs to be set for each client that connects, or another protocol that can do this more easily. After some searching I have been looking at twisted, but since this is already written, Id rather modify it than have to rewrite it. I know for now I could just always get the username and password from the client, but in the intrest of resources having to authenticate on every request and saving bandwidth which some of my clients have in very limited quantities, Id rather not do that.p  pAlso, this is my first time trying to secure something like thisand I am not trained in internet security, so if I am overlooking some glaring error in my logic, please tell me. Basically, I cant have someone sending me fake variables in otheractionsp

Negative 1603 pIm working on an invoicing system, and am using a codeDataGridcode for item entry. I want users to be able to enter the quantities in different units e.g. inches, feet, meters and for that entered quantity to be converted to the items stocking units. My first thought was to implement an codeIMultiValueConvertercode, but Ive been trying since yesterday and cannot figure it out.p  pMy Convert method works for sure, I have actually taken the body, stuck it in another method and tested its output. My program is crashing in the codeConvertBackcode method, Im new to C and Ive never seen anyone actually implement that method, so Im wondering why Its forcing me to implement it Im guessing its because my Quantity binding is not oneway, but I actually need the converted value to go back to the source objects Quantity property.p  pI dont really have a problem implementing the codeConvertBackcode method, but the value parameter that is passed to the method is the value the user entered, and not the converted value, why is that Should it not be the converted value, for that reason I cant really figure out how to go backwards, because I only have access to what the user is entering, and not the desired units in that method.p  pI realize my understanding of converters is probably way off, but if someone can help me understand where my thinkings off here, Id appreciate that as well as any potential workaroundssolutions for my problem.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1603 pIm working on a project for an academic institution and I need advice on the best way to approach this problem. Its been a long time since I did any traditional application development close to five years.p  pThe college administration recently revised the colleges academic standards policy. Previously, the administration only had three status codes, so this wasnt as big of an issue. However, the new policy has six status codesp  ol liGood Standingli liAcademic Concernli liAcademic Intervention 1li liOneTerm Dismissalli liAcademic Intervention 2li liFourTerm Dismissalli ol  pFrom here on, Ill differentiate between GPA for the term by saying termGPA and cumulative GPA by saying cumGPA. If a students strongtermGPAstrong falls below 2.0, and that causes hisher strongcumGPAstrong to also fall below 2.0, heshe gets placed on Academic Concern. Once on Academic Concern, one of three things can happen to students in following terms. Theyp  ol liReturn to good standing if their termGPA and cumGPA rise above 2.0.li liStay in the current status if their termGPA is above 2.0, but their cumGPA stays below 2.0.li liMove to the next status if both their termGPA and cumGPA are below 2.0.li ol  pNormally, I would approach this process by writing a console application that processed each student iteratively and building the status codes as I go. However, were handling at least 8000 students, and in most cases around 12,500 students per term.p  pAdditionally, this policy has to be applied retroactively over an asyetunspecified period of time since former students could return to the college and would then be subject to the new policys restrictions, and once I include a student in the data set, I have to go back through that students entire history with the college. Im conservatively guessing that Ill go through at least a million student records and calculating each students termGPA and rolling cumGPA.p  pQuestionsp  ol liIs there any way handle this problem in SQL and avoid using a cursorli liAssuming the answer to 1. is No How should I structure a console application Should I create a large collection and process a few thousand students at a time before writing to the database, or update the database after each I process each studentli liAm I making way too big of a deal about thisli ol  pThanks in advance for any insight and advice.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong Based on comments to answers here, I shouldve provided more information about the data structures and the way Im calculating the GPAs.p  pI cant use the precalculated cumGPA values in our database  I need the students cumGPA at the end of each progressive term, like so note I made up the GPA values belowp  precodeID      TermID  CumGpa  TermGPA TermNumber PolicyCode 123545  09102  2.08   2.08      1         GoodStanding 123545  09103  1.94   0.00      2         AcademicConcern 123545  09104  1.75   1.00      3         AcademicIntervention 123545  10112  1.88   2.07      4         AcademicIntervention 123545  10114  2.15   2.40      5         GoodStanding 123545  11121  2.30   2.86      6         GoodStanding codepre  pThe problem is that each subsequent terms status code could depend on the previous terms status code  Good Standing is actually the only one that doesnt.p  pAs far as I know, that means that I would have to use a cursor in SQL to get each students most current status code, which is not something Im interested in, as I work for a cashstrapped college that has precisely three database servers one for testing, and two servers with the same data on them were in the process of moving to SQL Server 2008 R2.p

Negative 1603 pHow do I delete files which have been deleted from the Repo but have not been deleted locally yetp  pEssentially, Im writing a strongbuild scriptstrong in powershell that needs to get the most uptodate changes from the repo and checkout, but there might be files which were deleted from the repo which havent yet been deleted from my local checkout. I mean, one solution is to just delete everything and do a clean checkout, but thats rather expensive and would take a long time. I could also do a svn status and look for anything with a D and delete them locally, but thats rather tedious. Id like to also just overwrite any conflicts and force the checkout for files which need to be merged.p  pIs there some simple command like revert or a checkout switch that Im missing p  hr  pstrongEdit There are actually two different cases that I need to handlestrongp  pstrongPart Astrong In one section, I need to leave anything modified in the working copy alone and just checkout the changes that arent conflicts or merged. I need this to never abort, meaning that I just want to throw away anything that has a problem and keep the workinglocal copy.p  pI was thinking of using codesvn update accept minefull forcecode emNoteem This is on the root directory and not individual filesp  pstrongPart Bstrong In the other section, I want to overwrite any changes and delete files which were deleted in the repo. p  pI was thinking of using codesvn update accept theirsfull forcecode emNoteem This is on the root directory and not individual files p  pWould this work Or is force or accept not what I want to be usingp  hr  pMy main concern with using update is that it will abort the entire process if theres a problem, wont it What does force do with svn update It also doesnt delete unversioned items.p  pRevert isnt exactly what I need either, is it It doesnt delete any of my unversioned items.p  pAlso, doesnt checkout just do the same thing as update if there are already local files It would be much simpler to just use checkout in the case where nothing exists yet. The problem is that I cannot specify the accept parameter with svn checkout. I suppose I could test if the folder exists and then do a checkout or an update accordingly.p

Negative 1603 pHi I have the following problem Im storing strings and a corresponding list of integer values in an codeMultiValueMapltString, Integergtcode Im storing about 13 000 000 million strings and one string can have up to 500 or more values. For every single value i will have random access on the Map. So worst case are 13 000 000 500 put calls. Now the speed of the map is good but the memory overhead gets quite high. A codeMultiValueMapltString, Integergtcode is nothing else then a codeHashMapTreeMapltString, ltArrayListltIntegergtgtcode. Both HashMap and TreeMap have quite a lot of memory Overhead. I wont be modifying the map once it is done, but I need it to be fast and as small as possible for random access in a program. Im storing it on disk and loading it on start, the serialized map file takes up about 600mb but in memory its about 3gbp  pthe most memory efficient thing would be, to store the String in sorted string array and have a corresponding two dimensional int array for values. So access would be a binary search on the string array and getting the corresponding values.p  pNow I have three ways to get therep  ol lipI use a sorted MultivalueMap TreeMap for the creation phase to store everything.After Im finished with getting all values, I get the string array by calling codemap.keyset.toArraynew String[0]code Make a two dimensional int array and get all the values from the multivaluemap. Pro Its easy to implement, It is still fast during creation.  Con It takes up even more memory during the copying from Map to Arrays.pli lipI use Arrays or maybe ArrayLists from the start and store everything in there Pro least memory overhead. Con this would be enormously slow because i would have to sortcopy the Array every time a add a new Key, Also i would need to implement my own propably even slower sorting to keep the corresponding int array in the same order like the strings. Hard to implementpli lipI use Arrays and a MultivalueMap as buffer. After the program finished 10 or 20 of the creation phase, I will add the values to the Arrays and keep them in order, then start a new Map. Pro Propably still fast enough and memory efficient enough. Con Hard to implement.pli ol  pNone of these solutions really feel right to me. Do you know any other solutions to this problem, maybe a memory efficient MultiValueMap implementation p  pI know I could be using a database so dont bother posting it as an answer. I want to know how i could do this without using a database.p

Negative 1603 pI am working on an application in which getting data back to a serial process as fast as possible is important, but there can be multiple sources to get that data from. As well, sometimes one source is faster than the other, but you dont know which source that will be. I am using ContinueWhenAny....Wait to await the first Task to end in order to continue and return out of the calling method. However, I need to check the validity of the data first, and only then return or if all Tasks have finished and none of them have valid data. Right now my code will return even invalid data if thats the Task that finishes first.p  pIs there a way to do something like ContinueWhenAny but only when the Task.Result meets a certain condition, otherwise wait for the next tasketc.. until the last task finishesp  pAs well, I need to make sure after one result is valid, that the other threads Cancel out. This part is already working fine.p  pCurrently, my code looks like this stripped of exception handling, just the nuts and boltsp  precode        ResultObject result  null         var tokenSource  new CancellationTokenSource         var tasks  listOfSources                 .Selecti gt Task.Factory.StartNew                      gt                                                      i.CancellationToken  tokenSource.Token                             Database Call                             return i.getDatainputparameters                         , tokenSource.Token          Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAny                 tasks.ToArray,                 firstCompleted gt                                              This is the result I need to validate before setting and canceling the other threads                         result  firstCompleted.Result                         tokenSource.Cancel                     .Wait         return result codepre  pAny ideas I dont want to use ContinueWhenAll since if the first call takes 2 seconds and the second takes 10 seconds, I want to get back to the serial process in 2 seconds if the first call returns valid data, otherwise wait 10 seconds, hope that result has valid data, and only return invalid data if all Tasks have completed and return an invalid result.p  p UPDATE  Thanks zmbq for the great idea. The updated working code is below and fulfills all my requirements. One caveat however, the difference between this code and the previous code is that this code will return a null result if none of the Tasks produce a valid result, rather than the previous code which returns the invalid result itself. It wouldnt be difficult to change this version to do so too, but Im perfectly content returning a null in that case for my purposes.p  precode        ResultObject result  null         var tokenSource  new CancellationTokenSource         var tasks  listOfSources                 .Selecti gt Task.Factory.StartNew                      gt                                                      i.CancellationToken  tokenSource.Token                             Database Call                             return i.getDatainputparameters                         , tokenSource.Token.ToArray          result  GetFirstValidResulttokenSource,tasks          return result      private ResultObject GetFirstValidResultCancellationTokenSource tokenSource, TaskltResultObjectgt[] tasks              ResultObject result  null         Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAny             tasks,             firstCompleted gt                                      var testResult  firstCompleted.Result                     iftestResult  null ampamp testResult.IsValid                                              result  testResult                         tokenSource.Cancel                                          else                                              var remainingTasks  tasks.Exceptnew[]firstCompleted.ToArray                         ifremainingTasks.Any                                                      result  GetFirstValidResulttokenSource, remainingTasks                                                                .Wait         return result      codepre

However, if the hidden div isnt visible, then when it is made visible, its background color is still white. The reason for this seems to be because Im changing the property that is used in a with binding that wraps the hidden cell. It seems when you change the property bound with with, it resets the style for its subitems.p  pIf that makes no sense, do this on the jsFiddle. Click the button, then click the Click to open cell. Notice that item 2 isnt highlighted. Click the button again and itll be highlighted. Now click the Click to open cell again, notice that item 2 is no longer highlighted. Now remove the line that sets someProperty in the show function and repeat the experiment. item 1 is now highlighted correctly regardless of whether or not it was visible when you click the color cells buttonp  pIs this by design Is there a way to work around it so that changing a property used by with doesnt reset the stylep

Negative 1603 pThere have been many questions regarding request scoped management in unit tests and mainly answer is to do not test the scope management, as its a Spring Framework task and it should take care that it works properly.

Negative 1603 pI am creating an Android game and have come across a problem. It is a simple Pong style game where a bat is moved left or right to block a ball. However I am trying to control the bat via a UDP connection. I have my server set up on my Android code and then a separate Java class for the client. At the minute I can only send strings or longs from the client to server. What I am trying to achieve is, on the client while it is waiting for an input if I press the left or right arrows then it will get this data, convert it to bytes and then send it to the server. The server should then receive the data as a key press so that the bat image of the game will move in the appropriate direction. If anyone has any idea how to do this it would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 1603 pSometimes, I want to use luapushstring in places after I allocated some resources which I would need to cleanup in case of failure. However, as the documentation seems to imply, luapush functions can always end up with an out of memory exception.

Negative 1603 pwhat is the best practice of distributing binaries from a github project p  pI can think ofp  ul liCreate a bin folder in your project where you keep a copy of the binaries.  However, github is meant to store source code and not binaries Storing large and  regularly changing binaries may be expensive qua diskspace and bandwidthli liUpload a copy of the binaries to the a hrefhttppages.github.comgithub pagesa of the  project, or use a separate web site for hosting your binaries.  However, that is not always feasible, and requires more handwork to keep the binaries up to date, I rather want to have the binaries updated automatically or with a single action. li ul

Negative 1603 pi have created a php code which compresses mp3 while uploaded to 32kbps bit rate i have referred this threadp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4628221howtocompressorconverttolowqualitymp3filefromphpHow to compress or convert to low quality Mp3 file from PHPap  pused this codep  precodeexecffmpeg i inputfile.mp3 ab 24000 outputfile.mp3  codepre  pbut the problem is i cant compress more than 32kbps .my code instruct to compress upto 24kbps but after execution i can see the output file is 32kbps. can anyone tell what should i do so that i can compress more than 32kbps .or is there any limitation of ffmpeg p
Negative 1603 pI want to know if there is a way to set the Datepicker on disabled and still preserve the month navigation with the nextprev arrows in the calendarp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1603 pI have a scrollview in my app and the second I scroll to the last page of my scrollview I get segued to tableviewcontroller.p  pBut in order to achieve paging like animation when jumping from scrollview to tableview controller I extended UIStoryboardSegue class and implemented perform method like this p  precode void perform      UIViewController src  UIViewController  self.sourceViewController     UIViewController dst  UIViewController  self.destinationViewController      src.view.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 0     dst.view.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation320, 0      [UIView animateWithDuration0.3                      animations                          [src presentModalViewControllerdst animatedNO]                          src.view.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation320, 0                          dst.view.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 0                            ]  codepre  pAnd it works like a charm when user is in UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait orientation.

Negative 1603 pI am trying to make a CSS based nav bar that converts a ULLI list including sub ULLI lists that display on hover into a horizontal nav bar and a sub horizontal nav bar.  My current implementation see picture works except the sub list is using positionabsolute to get its position below the hovered element.  I believe that is the source of my problem, as the absolute positioned sub menu doesnt respect the edges of the container, so if the browser gets too small it bleeds off the edge of the container while the top level menu wraps.  The other problem im having is that it doesnt expand the page vertically when the top level menu wraps, so even though its taking up more space the paragraph following doesnt move down and gets overlapped.p  pDoes anybody have any CSS tips or know of any good examples of a menu like the one Im trying to makep  pLink to image a hrefhttpi47.tinypic.com288tbn7.png relnofollowhttpi47.tinypic.com288tbn7.pngap

If we need to transfer some commits from develop to production  we merge trunk and master branch.p  pMaybe there are other ways to transfer and control changes to production server Or use a different version control systemp

Negative 1603 pThe new codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode implemented in ASP.NET MVC4 allows easy, builtin support for two popular OpenID providers Google and Yahoo and three OAuth providers Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter. p  pThe providers implemented in a hrefhttpsgithub.comDotNetOpenAuthDotNetOpenAuthtreemastersrcDotNetOpenAuth.AspNetClientscodeDotNetOpenAuth.AspNet.Clientscodea for use with the codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode all use static URLs for their identity services  that is, all users use the same wellknown URL to access the provider. The users OpenID identifiers are separate from the URL used to access the identity service.p  pFor example, Googles OpenID service URL is codehttpswww.google.comaccountso8idcode for all users.p  pThis works with the codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode in MVC4, where the URL of the identity provider needs to be known, constant, and registered at the time your MVC app starts up.p  pThe problem is, other OpenID providers commonly use the users unique OpenID identifier as the URL to access the identity service.p  pFor example, AOL and WordPress use codehttpsopenid.aol.comusernamecode and codehttpsusername.wordpress.comcode, respectively.p  pIf you replace the codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode with your own implementation of an codeExtendedMembershipProvidercode, then you can roll your own provider implementations, but then it doesnt work with the MVC4 codeAccountcode controller outofthebox.p  pHow does one implement a new OpenID Relying Party using the codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode, when the provider uses unique identifiers with the username in the URLp

Have also explored analytical functions such as rank... my bag of tricks is empty.p  pAny ideasp  pbr  strongClarificationstrongp  pThe reason I dont want the extra records in the root list is because I only want one group of results for each user.  I.E., if Bob Smith has had four accounts during his career here people come and go frequently, as employees andor contractors, I want to work with a set of accounts that all belonged to Bob Smith.p  pIf Bob came here as an contractor, converted to an employee, left, came back as a contractor in another country, and leftreturned to a legal org that is now in our SAP system, his account renamechain might look likep  precodeBob Smith  CONTRACTOR       US0T0001  gt  US001101  given a new ID as an employee Bob Smith  EMPLOYEE         US001101  gt  EB0T0001  contractor ID for  the UK Bob Smith  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T000T                no rename performed Bob Smith  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                currentlyactive ID codepre  pIn the above example, the four accounts are linked by either a codenewuseridcode field that was set when the user was renamed or through having the same SAP ID.p  pBecause HR frequently fails to follow the business process, returning users may end up with any of those four ID being restored to them.  I have to analyze all the IDs for Bob Smith and say Bob Smith can only have TE110001 restored, and kick back an error if they try to restore something else.  I have to do it for 90,000 records.p  pThe first column, Bob Smith, is just an identifier to the group of associated accounts.  In my original example, Im using the root User ID as the identifier e.g. US0T0001.  If I use firstlast names to identify users, I end up with collisions.p  pSo Bob Smith would look like thisp  precodeUS0T0001  1  CONTRACTOR       US0T0001  gt  US001101  given a new ID as an employee US0T0001  2  EMPLOYEE         US001101  gt  EB0T0001  contractor ID for  the UK US0T0001  3  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T0001                no rename performed US0T0001  4  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                currentlyactive ID codepre  p... where 1, 2, 3, 4 are the levels in the heirarchy.  p  pSince US0T0001, US001101, EB0T0001, and TE110001 are all accounted for, I dont want another group for them.  But the results I have now have those accounts listed in multiple groups  p  precodeUS001101  1  EMPLOYEE         US001101  gt  EB0T0001   US001101  2  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T0001                 US001101  3  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                 EB0T0001  1  CONTRACTOR  SAP001   EB0T0001                EB0T0001  2  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                  US001101  1  EMPLOYEE    SAP001   TE110001                  codepre  pThis causes two problemsp  ol liWhen I query the results for a User ID, I get hits from multiple groupsli liEach group will report a different expected user ID for Bob Smith.li ol  pbr  You asked for an expanded set of records... here are some actual datap  precode NumRootUsers tells me how many accounts are associated with a user.

In my example, I found where the object was being referenced, thus preventing its collection, but that was not reported by the script.p  pTherefore, the basic premise of this question is somewhat flawed.p  pstrongThe backgoundstrongp  pI am working on enhancing the scripting engine in the game a hrefhttpbitfighter.org relnofollowBitfightera.  I am not convinced that memory is being released properly.  So I constructed a test, in the form of the script below.  p  pIt prints 3 columns of userdatas.  Column 1 is a userdata I expect to be used nowhere else, and should therefore be destroyed by the collectgarbage function.  Columns 2 and 3 are objects I do not believe should be collected, because I am keeping a handle on them. p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThe userdata in column 1 never varies, so I suspect it is not being collected cols. 2 and 3 behave as expected.  To further clarify the situation, I am using the luatraverse script mentioned in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7166124findallreferencestoanobjectinluathis problema, which seems to confirm that there is only one reference to obj100, which is that stored in obj100 itself.

I have 3 frames loginFrame, adminFrame, nonAdminFrame.. loginFrame  to login which starts nonAdminFrame where the add deleting songs are taken careof The login is being handled as I have data folder where .txt files are used to write user objects which has the song info type linked lists. The way i login I look into the data folder and see if there is .txt file named user1.txt file and it will load up all data into nonadminFrame... The problem is login is not working properly as it as references to older nonAdminFrame where the previous user data is still present...p  pI have 3 classes or 3 JFrames. The mainclass is loginFrame. I get the login info and see if the user is admin or nonadmin and then show the admin or nonadminFrame by creating a new adminFrame object or nonAdminFrame object and i set loginFrame.setVisiblefalse The problem is with nonAdminFrame where the all itunes library stuff happens. I have JTree to show all the songs for that user and once the clicks logout I dispose of the nonAdmin frame using frame.dispose but if I login again with a different again creating a nonadminFrame object I see old users data in the JTree that the problem...p

Negative 1603 pI have been asked to add functionality and fix known bugs on a web appphp, jquery, html that hits a MySQL database.  I noticed that several admin pages were not updating properly. Specifically, the text that was being entered was being cut off at around 20 characters.  After doing some checking on the code, the database routines, and the database field to make sure there were no character limitsthe field was declared VARCHAR60 I believe, I decided to see what would happen if I changed the field to type TEXT.  And it started working  p  pSo that problem is fixed, however, I then read that type TEXT is depreciated and it is recommended to use type VARCHAR.  So the question is, do I just leave it as type TEXT and not worry about it, or do I work on getting it to work as VARCHAR, and does anyone know why VARCHAR is acting upp

Negative 1603 pIm working on creating a Gantt chart primarily using D3.js a hrefhttpjsbin.comuzipin4 relnofollowlinka to the functioning example. The Gantt chart has vertical gridlines to separate each individual day column the columns on the right in the picture below, and the whole codetablecode has horizontal gridlines which separates each rowproject. Heres an example of the generated chartp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comT5bhSFd.png altAn example generated Gantt chartp  pIn order to drastically cut down on the number of elements that are created and improve performance, instead of creating a table cell for each projectdate address which would create coderows  dayscode elements, I opted to simply draw those vertical gridlines using one absolutely positioned codedivcode in the header cell for each day. For example, in the picture, the code30code, code31code, code1code, etc. cells each have an absolutely positioned codedivcode whose height Ive manually set to the full height of the table. The structure of the chart is like sop  precodelttablegt     lttrgtlttd colspan5gtlttdgtlttdgt20121230 to ...lttdgt ... lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtEst.

Ideally, Id like to be able to set the height of codediv.backgroundcode to code100code in reference to the height of the full table itself, without having to use JavaScript, although if its absolutely necessaryimpossible to avoid, I will concede. This problem is most relevantnoticeable once you begin to add or remove project rows to simulate this, I just decreased the height of the codedivcodes in the picture belowp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comj9QpKdt.png altImproper gridlinesp  pThe relevant styles for the classes in the code above arep  ul licodediv.innercode  codeposition relative width 19pxcodeli licodediv.backgroundcode  codeposition absolute top 1px left 1px right 1px lineheight 24pxcodeli ul  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comuzipin4 relnofollowAgain, heres a functioning example of the charts HTML and CSSa JSBin. My attempts at solutions so far have included setting the codepositioncode of the codetablecode to coderelativecode and various similar things. Ive even considered setting the height to something absurd like code9999pxcode and setting codeoverflowy hiddencode on the table but Id prefer a cleaner solution if there is one.p
Negative 1603 pAs a developer, Im trying to make my classes more modular and reusable.  One of the areas where Ive run into problems is when I design a class to work with entity framework entities.p  pFor example, I might create a shopping cart class, whos role is to act as a container for products, discounts, and other things related to checkout.  It exposes methods to get the cart total, and enforce some business rules related to what a cart can and cant do.p  pI might create and entityframework entity thats a Product and make my shopping cart accept this entity.  However convenient this seems, it creates an unwanted dependency on the Product class in the project that Im using the shopping cart in.  If I wanted to reuse that shopping cart into another project, the Product entity wouldnt necessarily be the same.p  pHow can I elegantly decouple my shopping cart class from entity framework in a way that isnt going to cause architectural problems down the roadp  pIve thought of creating an interface IProduct that has the related properties and methods that the shopping card would need and then make my entity class an instance of IProduct.p  pBasically, Im looking for a good design pattern to decouple my classes from a projects local domain entities, whatever form they might take..p  pstrongHeres what I ended up going with a generic shopping cart where T is IProduct.

Am I overcomplicating it  Would it be better practice to just refresh the system variables with an SQL select every page viewp

Negative 1603 pGood eveningmorning everyone, p  pbefore posting this issue, ive been sending my objects with a traditional way from the client side  aspx page  to a WCF data service, the approch ive been using was to convert all attributes to a string and send them after joining them, and in the server side i split the string chain and i construct my object and store it. now by working i found that this method is no longer udapted to what im planing to do and it will take me much time. so ive decided to find a way of serializing my xpo objects and send them to the service. been browsing google before coming up to SOF but i didnt find a good tutorial for someone not much familiar with serialization mechanism. p  pplease give me some track to a solution which will reduce lot of time. p  pi think its a good point to descibe the architecture of my project p  pi have a asp web application which contains some pages, and in the server side i have a wcf data service5.0 which contains all my methods, im using XPO as a ORM and all my objects inherit from xpobject. p  pThank you in advance and by the way i want to thank the modsadminsmembers of SOF for their work helping dummiesintermediate and even experts. p
Negative 1603 pThis is my first time posting in stackoverflow, so I hope Im doing everything right in terms of site etiquette. I am in a beginning programming class Python, and my current assignment is to calculate the molecular weight of a compound of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, given a user input. It can be anything from C2 to C8H19O2, and so on. p  pI have my code and I keep getting an error I am unfamiliar with. Essentially what I am trying to do is have the code read the input compound character by character determining if it is a molecule or not. Then, it reads the character to the right of the previous character to determine if that is a number of another compound. If it is a different compound, then the previous single compound is added to a running tally of whichever molecule it was total. if it is a number, then it will read the next character to the right to once again determine if it is a number or character. If it is a number, it multiplies the previous character number by 10 and then adds the next one, and so on, until it reaches the next characterC123H2 would be 101  2 followed by 1012  3, and then it would add 123 Carbons to the running tally. Once our runny tallies are complete, then that number is multiplied by the molecular weight of one of each. I keep getting an index error that says my list index is out of range.

Negative 1603 pI have written a library doesnt matter what it does, which obviously has its header file. Now, I want to hide private elements of that header file, so if I provide my library to somebody, heshe should only see public members preferably no class definition, nothing other than function definitions. One way would be creating Cstyle header, which will contain some kind of init method which will be used to create an instance of the actual class of library and the user will have to pass a pointer of that object to every function to do the job. p  pIs it a good practicep  pAre there any other publicly accepted ways of doing something like thatp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1603 pI am automating a process for my work and am trying to address some issues that will occur in the future. Part of my process is to import different spreadsheets, look for employee names and then find out who their manager is. The problem I am faced with is that people are known as different names on different systems. For example, somebody named Donald Donaldson may be called Don Donaldson on the System, but has his full name on the employee list. Alternatively, Dave Davidison is David Davidson on the system.p  pThis occurs a number of times as some people appear 2 times on the System list and will slow down the entire process while my colleagues manually fix the issues. To address this, I created 3 tablesDynamic Named Ranges on my Data Tab. Each table sample found below had a different purpose a list of wrong names names, a list of replacement names Rep and alist of the names extracted from the System Compare. I want to look through the Compare list to see if there are any instances of names appearing. If it finds an instance then it will replace the name with the correct onep  pI feel that I am very close to achieving what needs done, but I lack that moment of brilliance to help me burst through.p  pemstrongMy Approachemstrongp  pI have 3 Dynamic Named Ranges range length will change depending on what is extracted from the other files and I have stored them as 3 dynamic arrays for that very reason. My code is looping through each element in Names, each in Rep and each in Compare. If the value in Compare z is equal to the value in Names x then we change the value of it to what is in Rep so z  y The problem with that is that only the value of z changes, and not the corresponding value in my array. i.e. Don Donaldson is the 3rd element in Compare. I find a match so Z changed from Don Donaldson to Donald Donaldson. Compare3, however, remains Don Donaldson.p  pI have tried making a 4th dynamic array, and and using ReDim to increase the length of it with every iteration. With every match myArrindex is equal to y, and after the loop a 4th named range TestRange is set to the value of this array, this approach does not work either.p  pIs anyone able to help me How do I change the value of an element in an Array compare and also how do I output this new array to a named range p  pMy Code and a sample of my data is shown below.p  pPleas help.

Negative 1603 pWere making an iOS racing game with the app engine as backend. However in late June something strange happened I just now got back from my vacation, hence Im posting now.p  pThe client posts scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a putget. But in late June, for a couple hours, old data was returned to the client. It happened for a while but then the data fixed itself. p  pHowever this still got us into trouble as on score submission we check that the server only has one highscore per player, but this app engine bug caused the server to have multiple scores for some players. p  pSo what happened was Player A submits score, Player B submits score, data got reverted to when only Player A existed, Player B submits new score it gets stored as server doesnt see a player B, server fixes data problem and now we have to Player B.p  pHow should you go about if you want to be able to rely on the app engines backend This could be a deal breaker.p  pstrongTo be more specific As requested in the commentsstrongp  pI was simplyfying what we were doing a bit.

Negative 1603 pAs far as I can tell, there are essentially three different kinds of closure in Ruby methods, procs and lambdas.

The database has to store the lt br  tags on save... it seems that textareas use newlines n and returns r instead so the conversion between these lt br , n and r is becoming a bit of an issue for me.  p  pIs there a proper way to handle this between multiple browsers  Perhaps it might be easier to just use textareas the whole time and forget about the divs  Its when I try to move the content between a div and a textarea and then back to a div, funky things start to happen with the spacing.p  pstrongMore Detail Editstrongp  pIf the user clicks edit and turns the original div into a textarea, they start making changes and click done, but decide to cancel editing and revert to the old content instead. The textarea turns back into a div and the old content stored in a hidden div replaces what the user had written. Hence the back and forth of content.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pGreat feedback, thanks all  Id prefer not to use the whtiespace css as this needs to work on websites that have been developed already and would require edits on all of the divs holding the content on every page.  lt br s must be saved in the database.p

Negative 1603 pI have been doing a lot of different research on this and from what I have found out, tryparse and parse does not exist for strings. So I am looking for an alternative for this.p  pI have 7 different textboxes and when the button is clicked I need it to check the textboxes the variable is a string and if the textbox is empty, I want it to completley skip it. If there is a string in the textbox, I want it to add it to a list. It doesnt have to be a list, I would prefer a list but I am not going to be picky Pretty much the best possible way.

I have never used a list before and this is the first time, and I am not completely understanding the out keyword. Every time I do a search, nothing comes up besides saying if textbox1.Text   but that isnt showing how to skip the textbox. p  pAlso, using the above code, and another list that looks identical to that, except the textboxes are identical and the name is different, I get an error saying I am using an undeclared variable when using this code at the end of the above codep  precodeif ListGrades.Count gt 0 ampamp ListCredits.Count gt 0     AverageGrade  ListGrades.Sum  ListCredits.Sum codepre  pDo I have to add an else statement on to that When I do it works, but I am not sure what I could add so the end result would not get messed up.p  pIf you guys need any more information, please let me know.

Negative 1603 pI am trying to create an algorithm to sort out the most relevant data for a specific userid.p  pI imagine my end result to be an array with KEY as the found USERID and the VALUE to be the number of times the specific USERID has been found in the different rows.p  pSo, I need to look through different rows in different tables and look for where CURRENTUSERID lets say id 30 exists, and then find the RECIEVERID, that is the user which was communicated to. This is pretty hard to explain, but lets take an examplep  ul liI have a table called eduposts, which contains wallposts and comments to theese. The are different values in this table, but the ones we should focus on is postauthor and postreciever. We then have to look for all the rows where postauthor equals 30 the test example just needs to be the current users id and then print out the postreciever IDS. This would be easy enough with a single query, but lets say we have to find data in 5 or 10 different tables, that 10 different queries, which is a lot.li liWe also have a table called edufolowers. There we have to look for where followauthor equals 30 the test example just needs to be the current users id, and then print out the followuser ID. Again, to find out who the current user have interest in.li ul  pI image the final mysqlfetch to look something like thisp  precodeuserid gt 25 timesfound gt 5 userid gt 11 timesfound gt 3 userid gt 95 timesfound gt 1 codepre  petc.p  pCan this be done using a single query, maybe using JOIN And even maybe count the results IN the query, so I dont have to do this manually in the PHP code.p  pOr should I create a mysqlquery for every table I wish to get data from, and then manage the data afterwards using PHP This sounds like the easiest way to me, but also the most inefficient relating to script optimization.p  pI have tried out with the following testquery p  precodeSELECT     u.userid AS userid,     f.followuser AS useridfollow,     p.postreciever AS useridposts FROM     eduposts u LEFT JOIN edufollowers f ON f.followauthor  30 LEFT JOIN eduposts p ON p.postauthor  30 ampamp p.postreciever  30 WHERE      u.userid  30 GROUP BY     f.followid, p.postid codepre  pBut the problem is that it outputs unexcepted results, and also I will have different values to look for, fx userid not really needed, as we already know that it is 30, useridfollow, useridposts, and so on.p  pI hope you understand my question, and please let me know, if you need additional information. p  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 1603 pIve been following the JBoss Picketlink 2.5.x a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgpicketlink2latestreferencehtmlch03.htmld5e498 relnofollowdocumentation found herea in an attempt to create a custom codeUsercode model for authenticating to my application.  My app is a typical JavaEE 6 application deployed on JBoss EAP 6.2.  Ive been able to successfully create the custom codeUsercode model class and am able to persist a user with no problem.  I see my custom attributes reflected in the database as expected.  My custom codeUsercode model looks like thisp  precodepublic class ExtendedUser extends User       private static final long serialVersionUID  9132382669181464122L      AttributeProperty     private String uniqueIdentifier  null    ...   codepre  p...and the code to create a new user account looks like thisp  precodeExtendedUser u  new ExtendedUserusername u.setFirstNamefirstName u.setLastNamelastName u.setEmailemailAddress u.setUniqueIdentifierUUID.randomUUID.toString  idm.addu idm.updateCredentialu, new Passwordpassword codepre  pAdditionally, I have a custom Entity model for the user account that looks like thisp  precodeEntityname  UserAccount Tablename  tbluseraccount, uniqueConstraints   UniqueConstraintcolumnNames   email   IdentityManaged ExtendedUser.class, Agent.class  public class UserAccountBean extends BaseAccountIdentityBean implements         IdentifiedDomainEntity       private static final long serialVersionUID  537779599507513418L         ltsnip... irrelevant fields...gt      Columnlength  ValidationConstants.UUIDLEN, unique  true     Unique     Lengthmax  ValidationConstants.UUIDLEN     Indexname  idxuseraccountuniqueid     AttributeValuename  uniqueIdentifier      NotEmpty     private String uniqueIdentifier  null    ... codepre  pI see the codeuniqueIdentifiercode attribute being populated in the database table as expected.  However, whenever I attempt to authenticate using a user created this way, the authentication fails.  Every time.  Is there something else I need to do to make use of my custom codeUsercode object  Do I have to specify it somewhere when creating my codeIdentitycode or codeIdentityManagercode instances  My authentication code is relatively simple and looks like thisp  precodeInject private DefaultLoginCredentials loginCredentials  null      ...          loginCredentials.setUserIdloginName     loginCredentials.setPasswordpassword      AuthenticationResult result  identity.login     if logger.isDebugEnabled          logger.debugauthenticateString, String, String  AuthenticationResult result  result NONNLS1      codepre  pAs I mentioned, this code fails every time.  Ive done the sanity check of doublechecking passwords, and I know they are correct.  I dont see any exceptions or errors written to the logs, so Im unsure what the problem could be.  The code works just fine if I use the standard codeUsercode object provided by the Picketlink library, even if I use the same Entity for the backend database.  It only fails when using codeExtendedUsercode, so Im sure Im missing something on my end.  Any advicep  pstrongUPDATEstrong  It appears that Picketlink 2.6.0 adds a bit more logging.  Ive upgraded and it still fails, but now I see the following error messagesp  precode144123,133 DEBUG [org.picketlink.idm.credential] httplocalhost127.0.0.190803 Starting validation for credentials [class org.picketlink.idm.credential.UsernamePasswordCredentials][org.picketlink.idm.credential.UsernamePasswordCredentials56370e07] using identity store [org.picketlink.idm.jpa.internal.JPAIdentityStore22ef0c6c] and credential handler [org.picketlink.idm.credential.handler.PasswordCredentialHandler387a19c9]. 144123,134 DEBUG [org.picketlink.idm.credential] httplocalhost127.0.0.190803 PLIDM001003 Trying to find account [user64] using default account type [class org.picketlink.idm.model.basic.User] with property [loginName]. 144123,136 DEBUG [org.picketlink.idm.credential] httplocalhost127.0.0.190803 PLIDM001003 Trying to find account [user64] using default account type [class org.picketlink.idm.model.basic.Agent] with property [loginName]. 144123,138 DEBUG [org.picketlink.idm.credential] httplocalhost127.0.0.190803 Account NOT FOUND for credentials [class org.picketlink.idm.credential.UsernamePasswordCredentials][org.picketlink.idm.credential.UsernamePasswordCredentials56370e07]. codepre  pSo, its clear that Picketlink is trying to use the standard codeUsercode object for authentication, rather than my custom object.  That said, how can I tell Picketlink to use my custom codeExtendedUsercode object for authenticatingp

Negative 1603 pIn my code I have an arbitrary number of processes exchanging some parts of their local vectors. The local vectors are vectors of pairs and for this reason Ive been using an MPI derived datatype. In principle I dont know how many elements each process sends to the others and for this reason I also have to send the size of the buffer. In particular, each process exchanges data with the process with rank myrank1 and with the process with rank myrank1. In case of process 0 instead of myrank1 it exchanges with process with rank commsize1. And as well in case of process commsize1 instead of myrank1 it exchanges with process with rank 0.

All representing different countriesp  pSo now I have a bunch of values stored as doubles that I need to sort in descending order.  I know I could just put the doubles into an array and sort it, but I will lose the name of the country associated to each value.

I would appreciate it if someone could at least point me in the right direction.p  pThe output needs to Display the countries name and its score in descending order.p

Whats worse, many people think that anemic objects are real objects,   and thus completely miss the point of what objectoriented design is   all about. In an anemic domain design, business logic is typically   implemented in separate classes which transform the state of the   domain objects. Fowler calls such external classes transaction   scripts. This pattern is a common approach in Java applications,   possibly encouraged by technologies such as early versions of EJBs   Entity Beans, as well as in .NET applications following the   ThreeLayered Services Application architecture where such objects   fall into the category of Business Entities although Business   Entities can also contain behaviorp blockquote  ul lia hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDatatransferobject relnofollowDTO Data Transfer Objectali ul  blockquote   pThe difference between data transfer objects and business objects or   data access objects is that a DTO does not have any behavior except   for storage and retrieval of its own data accessors and mutators.

Negative 1603 pIve got a Qt app that needs to call an expensive nonQt function e.g. to unzip a 200MB zip file, and since Im calling that function from the mainGUI thread, the Qt GUI freezes up until the operation completes i.e. sometimes for 510 seconds.p  pI know that one way to avoid that problem would be to call the expensive function from a separate thread, but since there isnt much the user can do until the unzip completes anyway, that seems like overkill.  I cant add processEvents calls into the expensive function itself, since that function is part of a nonQtaware codebase and I dont want to add a Qt dependency to it.p  pThe only thing I want to change, then, is to have a little Please wait type message appear during the time that the GUI is blocked, so that the user doesnt think that his mouse click was ignored.p  pI currently do that like thisp  precodeBusySplashWidget  splash  new BusySplashWidgetPlease wait, this splashgtshow qAppgtprocessEvents  make sure that the splash is actually visible at this point ReadGiantZipFile     this can take a long time to return delete splash codepre  pThis works 95 of the time, but occasionally the splash widget doesnt appear, or it appears only as a grey rectangle and the Please wait text is not visible.p  pMy question is, is there some other call besides qAppprocessEvents that I should also do to guarantee that the splash widget becomes fully visible before the lengthy operation commences  I suppose I could call qAppprocessEvents over and over again for 100mS, or something, to convince Qt that Im really serious about this, but Id like to avoid voodoobased programming if possible p  pIn case it matters, here is how I implemented my BusySplashWidget constructorp  precodeBusySplashWidget  BusySplashWidgetconst QString amp t, QWidget  parent  QSplashScreenparent     const int margin  5    QFontMetrics fm  fontMetrics    QRect r0,0,marginfm.widthtmargin, marginfm.ascentfm.descent1margin    QPixmap pmr.width, r.height    pm.fillwhite      these braces ensure that QPainter executes before setPixmap              QPainter pamppm       p.setPenblack       p.drawTextr, QtAlignCenter, t       p.drawRectQRect0,0,r.width1,r.height1        setPixmappm  codepre

Negative 1603 pI downloaded the samples from OpenCV for Android and let them run in eclipse on a real device Nexus 7. They all work fine, but when Im looking at the LogCat log, I see ca 20 errors displayed for each frame. The log is filled with them. Although all the samples work, this irritates me and makes it hard to debug the code. p  pHere a screenshot of the log img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCbitJ.png altscreenshot of logcat while running android OpenCV samplesp  pDoes anyone know where these errors come from and what they mean Should I worry about them, if no can I somehow hide them if yes what to dop  pAnother question I get, when running the JavaCameraView idle Sample CameraPreview only 15fps max. This is few, isnt it Or is this always like this when using OpenCV with Java over JNI instead of cp  pThanks in advance for any hints Isap
Negative 1603 pI am writing an emacs major mode for an in house scripting language. I am trying to set up font lock regexps for macros used by a preprocessing tool, which are of the form codeVNAMEcode. I want to match both the entire macro, and any later usages of the variable name. i.e. both codeVNAMEcode and codeVNAMEcode should be matched.p  pI have successfully matched the entire preprocessor macro withp  precode... .   .fontlockpreprocessorface ... codepre  pI have attempted to then also match the variable name by defining the letters inside the parenthesis as a group and then attempting to match the groupp  precode... .1   .fontlockpreprocessorface ... codepre  pbut I dont get any matches for group 1. Is this an allowable use of group references or do I have a syntax errorp
Negative 1603 pThe last few days I was trying to set a mavendevelopment environment up. Were using TeamCity for the CI, SonarQube for analysis and SonaType Nexus for the repository management.p  pTeamCity and SonarQube are working like a charm  The nexus however gives us lots of trouble.p  pThis kind of set up is nothing special, Ive done it several times now. This time however, I got a very weird bug TeamCity is able to deploy artifacts to the nexus, but gives an codeorg.apache.maven.wagon.authorization.AuthorizationException Not authorized , ReasonPhraseUnauthorized.code error when reading dependencies from the nexus.p  pI even tried changing the user that TeamCity uses from codedeploymentcode to codeadmincode, same issue. chown returned the correct values as well owned by the buildagent user.p  pI seriously have no clue what could cause this issue, I already tried reinstalling the nexus 3 times, even added the admin role to the deployment user  no change whatsoever.p  pThe settings.xml the buildagent user uses has the following content passwords marked with XXXp  pp  precodeltserversgt     lt This is the username password used to access the nexus repository gt     ltservergt          ltidgtcentralltidgt          ltusernamegtdeploymentltusernamegt          ltpasswordgtXXXltpasswordgt      ltservergt     ltservergt          ltidgtrnreleasesltidgt          ltusernamegtdeploymentltusernamegt          ltpasswordgtXXXltpasswordgt      ltservergt     ltservergt          ltidgtrnsnapshotsltidgt          ltusernamegtdeploymentltusernamegt          ltpasswordgtXXXltpasswordgt      ltservergt ltserversgt  ltmirrorsgt     ltmirrorgt       ltThis sends everything else to public gt       ltidgtnexusltidgt       ltmirrorOfgtcentralltmirrorOfgt       lturlgthttpbuild.example.com8301contentgroupspubliclturlgt     ltmirrorgt ltmirrorsgt  ltprofilesgt     ltprofilegt         ltidgtnexusltidgt         ltEnable snapshots for the built in central repo to direct gt         ltall requests to nexus via the mirror gt         ltrepositoriesgt             ltrepositorygt                 ltidgtcentralltidgt                 lturlgthttpcentrallturlgt                 ltreleasesgtltenabledgttrueltenabledgtltreleasesgt                 ltsnapshotsgtltenabledgttrueltenabledgtltsnapshotsgt             ltrepositorygt         ltrepositoriesgt         ltpluginRepositoriesgt             ltpluginRepositorygt                 ltidgtcentralltidgt                 lturlgthttpcentrallturlgt                 ltreleasesgtltenabledgttrueltenabledgtltreleasesgt                 ltsnapshotsgtltenabledgttrueltenabledgtltsnapshotsgt             ltpluginRepositorygt         ltpluginRepositoriesgt     ltprofilegt ltprofilesgt  ltactiveProfilesgt     ltactiveProfilegtnexusltactiveProfilegt ltactiveProfilesgt codepre  pp  pFor your information The build log from TeamCity states that the settings are getting read correctly as well, so thats not the cause either.p  pI really would like to fix this asap, since we have developers waiting to continue on their projects and we dont want to give out the url if its not secured, we have private projects running on the CI.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEditstrong So I now even tried installing artifactory  and I still have the same issue.

Negative 1603 pI have added the NugetCoapp package for Expat a hrefhttpsgithub.comcoapppackagesexpat relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcoapppackagesexpata to my Visual C 2012 project. The project is using the Unicode charset and I finally found where I configure the Expat build rules Project properties  Configuration Properties  Referenced Packages  expat. I have set the UTFwidth property there to utf16. This is working, ie codeXMLCharcode becomes codewchartcode during compilation. However, it seems that the redistributable package which contains the DLLs is not affected by this setting, because it copies libexpat.dll instead of libexpatw.dll to the output directory. If I manually copy the correct DLL, my programme is running as expected.p  pHow do I fix the build process to copy the right version of the DLLp

Negative 1603 pAlright, this query will not run and returns a data type mismatch error. This error did not start until I attempted to join two tables within the subquery in the WHERE clause. p  pThe two tables I am attempting to join are the exact two tables that are joined in the primary query. Each table contains a column, CRD Number. In one table, it is stored as text, in the other, it is stored as number. This is why I have used the CStr function to cast the numerical column as a textual column. This worked beautifully for the primary query thank Stack Overflow but when I attempted to do the same exact join in the subquery, I received the data type mismatch error. p  pHere is a picture, with a small arrow and text box to highlight the area which I 99 sure believe is causing the problem. Again, the problem only arose when I attempted to join these two tables in the subquery. If the join is removed, the query will run. Although the subquery will not return the correct results, thus making my primary query useless p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3Y7JJ.jpg altMy issuep  pAll my Access DBs are set to accept Standard TSQL syntax, so I will also tag this as TSQLp

Negative 1603 pIm working on an app which needs to store many bitmap images in memory. No surprise, that codeOutOfMemoryErrorcode is often caught on some devices, when bitmap collection becomes too big. And I need to avoid this somehow.p  pSaying briefly, I need a kind of collection which will behave a kind of strongadd items one by one, until adding next item would cause OutOfMemoryErrorstrong, but Im not experienced enough to find a proper approach. I believe, some sort of weakreference collection should be implemented.p  pI like codeWeakHashMapcode, but there is one crucial problem with it  I cannot control how items will be discarded. In my app, bitmaps are added in order of priority the most important bitmaps, that should be stored as long as possible, go first. codeWeakHashMapcode, as I understand, doesnt provide such prioritization. p  pAny working approaches or ideasp  pemP. S. This question is not about bitmap optimization. Imagine, there are some big objects instead of bitmaps, that cannot be compressed or optimized. The question is about strongstoring items in memory directly controlling their priority, such that objects with low priority can be GCd quickly or not added at allstrong.emp  hr  pP. P. S. So far, I discovered two possible solutionsp  p1 dividing a collection in 2 parts, such that first, more prioritized, will contain emitems themselvesem i. e. strong references, and second will contain emsoft referencesem. Control of adding can be processed using codeRuntime.getRuntime.maxMemorycode and code.totalMemorycodewhen totalMemory occupied by the heap exceeds some  of maxMemory, adding new items into collection should be prohibitedp  p2 using a collection of soft references and track items codefinalizecodewhen it is invoked i. e. corresponding object is going to be picked by GC, return this item as a soft reference back to the collection and replace another itemwith least priorityby phantom reference. Theoretically, this would give more strict priority control, but Im not sure how it will behave in practice.p

Ive poked around in the AngularJS and Bootstrap API pages, but Im honestly not a very strong web developer, so JS isnt really my strong suit.p  pWould anyone be able to point me into the right direction to learn how to accomplish these actions Thank youp  p[EDIT] I thought it would be helpful to post a portion of my code that attempts to at least load these progress bars on page load. The following is from the pages code.html.erbcode filep  precodeltdiv idactivethreadsgt         lt activethreads.each do  activethread  gt             ltdiv classprogress progressstriped activegt                 ltdiv classprogressbar  roleprogressbar ariavaluenowlt activethread.progress gt ariavaluemin0 ariavaluemax100 stylewidth 45gt                     ltspan classsronlygtlt activethread.tos gtltspangt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     lt end gt ltdivgt codepre  phere, codeactivethreadscode is an Array maintained in another .rb file, which includes, as it implies, a list of all of the active threads. These threads are added to the array when created, and removed from it just before they terminate. This code doesnt work no progress bars load, and I can verify there are entries in codeactivethreadscode. Im not sure whats wrong.p

Negative 1603 pstrongDirect Questionstrong p  pWhat are best practices for design of database tables for storing urls configured on a page.p  pstrongOur use casestrongp  pWe had a design discussion and were unable to conclude on a what is the correct design. We  are writing a page with URLs embedded in a table. So the page looks likep  precode ....contentsome text...  a     b     c     d  text  url   url   url  text  url   url   url  text  url   url   url  ....contentsome text... codepre  pThe idea is to make these urls configured in database so that url changes does not need a deployment every time it url changes.p  pemEDITem codea,b,c,dcode are table headers. While the content under section codeacode will be a normal text the content under codeb,c,dcode will be hyperlinks.p  pGiven all this what should the table design for this structure. We considered two schemasp  precodea,burl,curl,durl   dependent on table design. advantage written code would                            be very simple and would not be dependent on the number                             of entries in the table.a simple for loop would                             suffice for presentation logic. Disadvantage if table                            changes in future, this table is doomed.                            EDITgta,b,c,d are place holders to represent that content                            represent the headers of table. id, url      advantage Generic enough to encompass any url.                disadvantage This would require presentation layer changes in                 case of new addition of new row.                EDITgtid is just a number to identify this url and would be used to                 refer while identifying this from presentation layer. codepre  pWe were unable to conclude which one of this is better to go with as each have its own tradeoffuntil we have missed something. Or none of this is good.p  pWe are using a NoSql Store and Jsp to write the frontendpresentation logic.p  pEDIT The following can be the type of changes that can happen to the tablep  ol liaddition of a new rowfrequent.li liremoval of an existing rowfrequent.li liOrder of columns can changebut rare.li liNumber of columns changevery rare, do not think ever happened but can happen.li liChange of underlying URLinherently supported in both designs, so not important.li ol  pThe main concern here is maintenance overheadboth in presentation and backend perspective  that will be caused by any one of the design considered.p  pEDIT2p  pSo this project is only about writing front end for the already existing services. We do not have to deal much with so called application state. But on a certain webpage there were a few URLsembedded in the table which I mentioned and business requirement was not to deploy this piece of code every time someone has pus a change requestlike change of existing url which is the most frequent type of change. So all the information on URLs is to be moved to a database and is to be queried on page loador may be preload so that we do not screw the performance of page from the webpage. Now this discussion was about designing a appropriate table for this use.p

Negative 1603 pIve got two Win32 programs program A, a web interface, and program B, a worker program, that operate on a collection of files.  Program A tells program B to perform an operation on a set of files, program B does it, and signals to program A that its done.p  pNow, heres the situation there might be multiple program As and program Bs on different computers, accessing files stored on a network share.  I need to ensure that only one program B is accessing a set of files at a time.p  pI could do it using lock files, but those have issues such as not going away if the owning process crashes that Id need to deal with.  I dont think I can use traditional file locking, since my architecture requires program A to control the locking while program B accesses the files.  Is there a solution Im not seeing, such as a networkwide mutexp

Though if I can save some of my time Id rather not if someone else has been able to solve this issue permanently.p  pstrongUpdate as of October 23,2014strongp  pThis issue is still occurring despite attempting the answers below. I have created a logging plugin to hopefully help track the frequency of the out of stock messages and hopefully help correlate the message with any actions taken place on the website. Its currently customized to this specific website, but Im working on a version to share with you all so that even if I cant find the answer, someone can.p

Negative 1603 pI have 103 data frames with 7 variables and more than 1000 rows. I want to find the number of occurrences of a pair of two columns of one data frame in other 102 data frames. In other words, how many times codecV1,V2code together two columns of a data frame together can be seen in other 102 data frames. p  pIve already written a code, but it is very slow p  pI put all 103 data frames in a list and convert it to a data frame. Then make a for loop to read each data frame one by one. and in each loop i have another for loop to search for each row of the data frame in that list p  pThe main part of the codes is as followsp  precode    fori in file          inputltread.tablei           forj in 11000             df1lt data.tableinput[j,c1,3]              countltmergedf1,dt, cV1, V3 dt is a data frame includes all 103 data frames             df1[count]ltnrowcount              codepre  pIn this way, I can count how many times set of V1 and V3 of a data frame, comes in other data frames. But obtaining the whole results needs more than 50 days p  pI wonder if anyone can help me with a faster way to obtain my desired results.p  hr  pExample of the data frames just 5 variable are considered herep  precode V1    V2  V3   V4  V5   1     Q0  abc  34  3  1     Q0  abd  31  9  1     Q0  bac  32  3  1     Q0  cba  56  0  2     Q0  zxc  37  3  2     Q0  fgc  30  3  2     Q0  ghc  36  3 codepre  pIn fact, I want to find out how many times each value of V3 comes in other data frames but because V3 and V1 are dependent. I must consider V1 in my search as well. So, I have to see how many times codecV1,V3code comes in other data frames. For example 1,abc together or 1, abd. p  pdt has the same structure as the data frames but it includes all data from all data frames that I have p

Negative 1603 pI cant quite understand how to achieve what I want. Im trying to load a random image in to an image view from the drawables folder. I do this by grabbing a reference to all the drawables and placing the id into an int array. I than randomly choose a number between zero and the max array length and populate the imageview with that image. p  pThe problem occurs when I rotate the screen too much, rather when too many random images have been loaded into memory im guessing, because an out of memory exception is thrown. p  pI have tried to recycle the after usage, but if I pull that image back up again i get a trying to reuse recycled bitmap error.p  pQuestions Activityp  precodepackage com.example.hiphoptrivia  import org.json.JSONArray import org.json.JSONException import org.json.JSONObject  import android.graphics.Bitmap import android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawable import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity import android.os.Bundle import android.util.Log import android.util.SparseArray import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.widget.Button import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.ImageView import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast  public class QuestionsActivity extends ActionBarActivity       private JSONObject dataBase  null     private JSONArray triviaQuestions  null     private int currentQuestion  0, currentDrawable     setup random question images     private int[] questionImages  new int[] R.drawable.boswellcheomural, R.drawable.buddha, R.drawable.dq,     R.drawable.equipment, R.drawable.graffiti, R.drawable.hugeimage, R.drawable.rappers, R.drawable.spraypaint,     R.drawable.wza      private static final String FILENAME  questiondata.txt     private static final String TAGQUESTION  Question     private static final String TAGANSWER  Answer     private static final String TAGINFO  Info     private static final String TAGTRIVIA  Trivia       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityquestions         createData         createQuestion         buttonSetup            Override     protected void onDestroy          super.onDestroy          ImageView imageView  ImageViewfindViewByIdR.id.randomImage         Drawable drawable  imageView.getDrawable         if drawable instanceof BitmapDrawable              BitmapDrawable bitmapDrawable  BitmapDrawable drawable             Bitmap bitmap  bitmapDrawable.getBitmap             bitmap.recycle             bitmap  null                    Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu           Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.questions, menu         return true           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item           Handle action bar item clicks here.

Negative 1603 pSo I used Kinect to obtain some depth images and they are now saved. So if I want to process this depth image to get the Z value i.e. the distance from the object to the Kinect how should I do thatp  pI have been doing some research online and found out that I need to be saving the image as a 16bit depth image for the depth values to be stored instead of an 8 bit depth image which can only store up to 256 values. based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6323676savekinectdepthimageinmatlabrq1Save Kinect depth image in Matlabap  pBut I still do not quite understand the image I am getting. When I use imread and uses the data cursor to look at the individual pixels, I only obtain the XY coordinates and an Index value. the index value does not seem to represent the distance in mm.p  pCan anyone clear this part for me please. Thanks.p

Negative 1603 pI have defined my own project nature in eclipse. This project has a specific file. For this file type I want to disable copy paste. I have already removed copy and Paste options from context menu of the file by using eclipse ActivityPattern binding. But, still the user can do CtrlC and CtrlV from keyboard to achieve the same. Is there any way I can disable these predefined key bindings in eclipse. I would like to define such a functionality in my plugin.xml. Please help.  p
Negative 1603 pI am currently trying to set up a portfolio site, and I added over 20 PNG images for my portfolio that are sized Natural 640x375 px. My site resizes each of them to 278x163px. p  pThey look absolutely awesome on the site right now, but I want to resize each of them to the exact dimension needed to decrease page load. Whenever I try to resize them, they get extremely blurry I tried using Photoshop, as well as many other online tools to resize PNGs.p  pHelp would be much appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 1603 pI am attempting to connect to Google API which requires OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Negative 1603 pI used to execute a script that at the end would distribute an email using Microsoft Outlook and a custom form. I found a website that told you how to create a custom form, insert some VBA script into it and then create a an application link that you could double click to send the email. You would then add a small line of code to a already existing python script that would execute the application and therefore send the email automatically. However, the other day I had my IT department upgrade my Microsoft Office suite from 32bit to 64bit and I can no longer send the email. Whenever I execute the script a popup window shows up saying that the file cannot be located. p  pI modified the code attempting to open another file instead and it works, meaning that the issue is with Microsoft Outlook solely. Please let me know if there is a way I can work around this without having to revert back to 32bit Microsoft Office since the upgrade is going to help me in other ways.

Negative 1603 pI am working with a database that was handed down to me. It has approximately 25 tables, and a very buggy query system that hasnt worked correctly for a while. I figured, instead of trying to bug test the existing code, Id just start over from scratch. I want to say before I get into it, Im not asking anyone to build the code for me. Im not that lazy, all I want to know is, what would be the best way to lay out the code The existing query uses JOIN to combine the results of all the tables in one variable, and spits it into the query. I have been told in other questions displaying this code, that its just too much, and far too many bugs to try to single out what is causing the break.p  pWhat would be the most efficient way to query these tables that reference each otherp  pExample Person chooses car year, make, model. PHP then gathers that information, and queries the SQL database to find what parts have matching year, vehicle ids, and parts compatible. It then uses those results to pull parts that have matching car model ids, OR vehicle idsbecause the database was built very sloppily, and compares all the different tables to produce Parts, descriptions, prices, part number, sku number, any retailer notes, wheelbase, drivetrain compatibility, etc.p  pIve been working on this for two weeks, and Im approaching my deadline with little to no progress. Im about to scrap their database, and just do data entry for a week, and rebuild their mess if it would be easier, but if I can use the existing pile of crap theyve given me, and save some time, I would prefer it.p  pWould it be easier to do a couple queries and compare the results, then use those results to query for more results, and do it step by step like that, or is one huge query comparing everything at once more efficientp  pShould I use JOIN and pull all the tables at once and compare, or pass the input into individual variables, and pass the PHP into javascript on the client side to save server load Would it be simpler to break the code up so I can identify the breaking points, or would using one long string decrease query time, and server loads This is a very complex question, but I just want to make sure there arent too many responses asking for clarification on trivial areas. Im mainly seeking the best advice possible on how to handle this complicated situation.p

Negative 1603 pI have OpenSearchServer OSS set up on my local web server. I see that there is a Search Cache that the application automatically applies. Unfortunately, this means that when I make requests using the following URL a hrefhttpexample.comrendererusefilecrawlampnamedefaultfileampqueryblue relnofollowhttpexample.comrendererusefilecrawlampnamedefaultfileampquerybluea, it just searches and returns results from a previous query. It wont find matches for current query blue. This does not seem to be a consistent problem. I noticed that after flushing the Search Cache, it then started working as it should be. But, I think that this is going to become an issue for me often. I do not want to have to flush the Search Cache. I just want to turn it off. Help Thanksp

Negative 1603 psince I think many of us dont have the same edition of Introduction to algorithms of Prof. Cormen et al., Im gonna write the Lemma and my question in the following.p  pEdmondsKarpAlgorithmp  pLemma 26.7 in 3rd edition in 2nd it may be Lemma 26.8 If the EdmondsKarp algorithm is run on a flow network GV,E with source s and sink t, then for all vertices v in Vs,t, the shortestpath distance  dfs,v in the residual network Gf increases monotonically with each flow augmentationp  pProof First, suppose that for some vertex v in Vs,t, there is a flow augmentation that causes the shortestpath distance from s to v to decrease, then we will derive a contradiction. Let f be the flow just before the first augmentation that decreases some shortestpath distance, and let f be the flow just afterward. Let v be the vertex with the minimum dfs,v, whose distance was decreased by the augmentation, so that dfs,v lt dfs,v. Let  p  s  u  u  be a shortest path from s to v in Gf, so that u,v in Ef andp  pdfs,u  dfs,v  1.             26.12p  pBecause of how we chose v, we know that the distance of vertex u from soruce s did not decrease, i.e.p  pdfs,u  dfs,u.                 26.13p  p...p  pMy question is I dont really understand the phrasep  pemBecause of how we chose v, we know that the distance of vertex u from soruce s did not decrease, i.e. dfs,u  dfs,u.                 26.13emp  pHow does the way we chose v affect the property that the distance of vertex u from s did not decrease  How can I derive the equation 26.13. p  pWe know, u is a vertex on the path s,v and u,v is also a part in s,v. Why can s,u not decrease as wellp  pThank you all for your help.p

Negative 1603 pI am trying to make an arcade game for my school project. The basic idea is to do all the math and drawing in other thread than the main, and to use the main thread only for input routines. Drawing is done by a procedure saved in an external unit, and is done by creating a bitmap, then drawing parts of the environment on the bitmap and finally dawing the bitmap on the main forms canvas. When I finished the drawing procedure, I tried to run it from the main thread, and managed to make everythink work as expected except for the fact that the whole application window was frozen, but since the main thread was working without stopping, sommething like that was expected. Then i tried to put the procedure in other thread, and it stopped working it didnt draw a single thing despite debug routines reporting that the procedure was repeatedly executed. After a few added and then deleted debug routnes, it started to work for no apparent reason, but not reliably. in about 80 of cases it runs smoothly, but in the rest it stops after ten to thirty frames, sometimes even not draving some of the environment parts in the last frame where it gets stuck.p  pThe important part of the main form unit looks like thisp  precodeprocedure TForm1.Button1ClickSender TObject  begin runningnot running if running then AppTheard.Createfalse end  Procedure AppTheard.execute  begin  form1.Button1.Captionrunning  while running do begin view.nextframe end  form1.Button1.Captionno longer running  end codepre  pand the nextframe procedure in the other unit looks like thisp  precode     Camera  class  ownerTform  focusGravityAffected  WallsPBlankLevel  CreepsMonsterList  FrameRateCap,lastframeinteger  BackgroundTBitmap  plochaTBitmap  RelativePosY,RelativePosXinteger  constructor createownerTform focusGravityAffected WallsPBlankLevel CreepsMonsterList FrameRateCapinteger backgroundTBitmap  procedure nextframe end         procedure camera.nextframe  var i,i1,top,topinfield, left,leftinfield integer     procedure Repair       some unimportant math here    Procedure vykreslicovec    begin    if co is gravityaffected then     plocha.Canvas.Drawco.PositionXfieldsizeGravityaffectedco.PosInFieldXLeftfieldsizeleftinfieldco.getImgPosX,      co.PositionYfieldsizeGravityaffectedco.PosInFieldYtopfieldsizetopinfieldco.getImgPosY,      co.image    else      plocha.Canvas.Drawco.PositionXfieldsizeLeftfieldsizeleftinfieldco.getImgPosX,      co.PositionYfieldsizetopfieldsizetopinfieldco.getImgPosY,      co.image    end   begin     some more unimportant math    vykreslifocus                                                     For i Left1 to left2plocha.Width div fieldsize do                                                         vykreslen zd    For i1 Top1 to top2plocha.Height div fieldsize do     if ilt Walls.LevelSizeX and i1lt Walls.LevelSizeY and igt0 and i1gt0 and walls.IsZedi,i1 then      begin vykresliwalls.GiveZedi,i1end    while absgettickcount mod highwordlastframe lt 1000 div FrameRateCap do sleep1    lastframegettickcount mod high word    owner.Canvas.Drawfieldsize,fieldsize,plocha        end codepre  pCan someone please tell me what am I doing wrongp

Negative 1603 pI have a web service I am trying to call from Java.  The XSD for the service defines a field as an xsdbase64Binary.  I am using maven jaxb2 plugin to generate Java artifacts.

SoapUI displays the data perfectly not encoded.  Watching the wire with wireshark I can also see the non encoded data.  My question is, how do I grab this data as a string in Java  I want to take this data and later write it into a file.  p  pResponse looks something like this Service Agreement,Interval Start Time,Interval End Time,Quantity,Unit of Measure .... etc.p  pRelevant bit of XSD p  pRelevant bit of generated javabr protected byte[] greenDocp  pIn my client java code I have been trying every possible combination of new Stringbyte[], new Stringbyte[], charset, Base64 decoding, etc. and I just cannot seem to get the data correctly.

Negative 1603 pWhen Im in a rush and want to code some straightforward functionality, the C, Visual Studio intellisense autocomplete is a very useful tool. However, there are some autogenerated code, that do not fit my codestyle. For example, when create a property, the default code isp  precode    public int MyProperty  get set  codepre  pThe code that would fit my style, when I add the public accessibility to the field later, is something likep  precode    public int MyProperty               get                            set                         codepre  pI understand, that there is a empropfullem keyword, that generates a private field for the property and a best practice is the actual generated code for the empropem keyword if you define public property. But I was wondering if there is way to define a complete to define an autocomplete keyword for intellisense. I fear that the answer is no. But, is there a wayp
Negative 1603 pIm using MapBox to plot points of interest that is submitted through a user generated form built on rails. Currently the user enters a address, then the address has its Lat and Lng calculated through a gem geocoder.

Negative 1603 pIm having trouble deciding the best route to take for the layout I want for my application.  My thought is to have something very similar to Google Nows layout where its a list of different types of cardviews that scroll with the entire page.

And the 3rd which can have n cards which all scroll with the page.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgH5sJ.png altMy app layout Every element in the 3rd card type will respond to a click event, which will launch a new fragment, and a long press event which I would like to eventually make the items actionable to both remove and rearrange certain elements.p  pProblem is, I dont know the best practice to achieve my desired layout. Should I do it with my RecyclerViews adapter using different ViewHolders  Going down that route seems like it would get messy pretty quick.

I can do it in my application multiple times, if I leave stdout alone, and it works.   I can get the stdout into my application, but it seems to go outofsync with the output from the hcitool.p  pHeres what I have written so farp  precodestdstring checkBluetoothPresencestdstring searchForMAC      int pipeOut[2]     pidt pid     char btRtnVal[255]        pipe2pipeOut, OCLOEXEC       Both threads will share a pipe  input from child, output to parent     switchpidfork          case 1    cout ltlt fork failed ltlt endl                 exit1     case 0      Child thread                 close1                Close stdout                 closepipeOut[0]       Close the output end of pipeOut                 dup2pipeOut[1], 1     Redirect stdout to pipeOut input                 closepipeOut[1]                 execlusrbinhcitool, hcitool, name, searchForMAC.cstr, charNULL     default     Parent thread                 close0                Close stdin                 closepipeOut[1]       Close the input to pipeOut                 dup2pipeOut[0], 0     Redirect stdin to the pipeOut output                 closepipeOut[0]                 waitpidpid, NULL, 0                 cin.getlinebtRtnVal, sizeofbtRtnVal1          return btRtnVal   codepre  pBasically, as it stands it will get the name of my bluetooth device correctly if it is detected, and return it.  That will work multiple times in a row my main function calls this every 15 seconds.  If I then turn bluetooth off on my device, it returns an empty string which is what I want.  After that point though, if I turn bluetooth back on again, it never works again.  It emshouldem detect it  it works on the command line, but not here.  Ive tried this with all of the pipe  dup2  close commands removed, and it works perfectly via stdout.  So I assume my problem lies with my pipe  dup2  close commands somewhere.  Ive tried a lot of variations this is just the latest, but cant get it to work.p  pI suspect its something to do with the redirecting of stdout not being correctly reset somewhere, but Ive read and tried dozens of combinations Ive found online and cant get any to work.  Any suggestions would be really appreciated  this has been driving me mad for hoursp  pMaybe the basic question is does anyone have a good, comprehensive example of redirecting the output from a shell command, reading it, then resetting everything so that when I call the same command a few seconds later it still worksp

It   may not be supported by all database platforms nor is it a requirement   to be supported by all persistence providers. Therefore, applications   that want to enable query timeouts must be prepared for three   scenarios.p      pThe first is that the property is silently ignored and has no effect.p      pThe second is that the property is enabled and any select, update, or   delete operation that runs longer than the specified timeout value is   aborted, and a QueryTimeoutException is thrown. This exception may be   handled and will not cause any active transaction to be marked for   rollback.p      pThe third scenario is that the property is enabled, but in doing so   the database forces a transaction rollback when the timeout is   exceeded. In this case, a PersistenceException will be thrown and the   transaction marked for rollback. In general, if enabled the   application should be written to handle the QueryTimeoutException, but   should not fail if the timeout is exceeded and the exception is not   thrown.p blockquote  pDoes anyone knows any other method to specify a timeout on a TypedQuery p  pOr how can I make this hint workingp  pThanksp  pstrongEDIT Oracle 11.2.0.4.0 and PostgreSql 9.2.9  with JPA 2.1  Hibernatestrongp

Negative 1603 pso I have this question. I have to write an algorithm in the most efficient way lowest runtime that receives 2 numbers, N and K. 5 lt N lt 100000, and K  0. After that, it receives N positive integers List of numbers, then it prints how many sub series not necessarily continues in a condition that in each sub series there are at least 2 numbers, and each number in the sub series is smaller by K of the following number in the same sub series.p  pFor example N6, K5. And the list of numbers 1 6 8 11 12 20. The print is 17. 17 sub seriesp  p6 1,  8 6 1,  11 8 6 1,  12 11 8 6 1,  12 8 6 1,  11 6 1,  12 11 6 1,p  p8 6,  11 8 6,  12 11 8 6,  12 8 6,  11 6,  12 11 6,p  p11 8,  12 11 8,  12 8,p  p12 11.p  pFrom right to left smallest to biggest It will only print 17 the number of them.

It was messy and complicated, i believe that theres some kind of a trick that Im missing.. Sorry for my bad english and if i didnt explain something properly.

Is there some error in my code, like Im not covering all possible combinations, or is there most likely an error in the hash value given to me p  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt include md5.hFile was sourced from httpwww.zedwood.comarticlecppmd5function  using namespace std  const int numPossibleChar  36 const string givenHash  ad2ad129385e4b2ba3b477378bc1d9b6 long count0make sure I go through all combinations  const char  charOptions[numPossibleChar]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,                             L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V,                             W, X, Y, Z, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,                             8, 9, 0    int main         for int i 0 iltnumPossibleChar i               string guess1  charOptions[i]         string guessHash  md5guess1         if md5guess1givenHash                      cout ltltmatch, password is ltlt guess1ltltendl             return 0                  coutltltguess1ltltendl         count         for int j0 jltnumPossibleChar j                      string guess2guess1charOptions[j]             if md5guess2givenHash                              cout ltltmatch, password is ltlt guess2ltltendl                 return 0                          count             forint k0 kltnumPossibleChar k                              string guess3guess2charOptions[k]                 if md5guess3 givenHash                                      cout ltltmatch, password is ltlt guess3ltltendl                     return 0                                  count                 forint l0 lltnumPossibleChar l                                      string guess4guess3charOptions[l]                     if md5guess4 givenHash                                              cout ltltmatch, password is ltlt guess4ltltendl                         return 0                                          count                     forint m0 mltnumPossibleChar m                                              string guess5guess4charOptions[m]                         if md5guess4givenHash                                                      cout ltltmatch, password is ltlt guess5ltltendl                             return 0                                                  count                         forint n0 nltnumPossibleChar n                                                      string guess6guess5charOptions[n]                             if md5guess6givenHash                                                              cout ltltmatch, password is ltlt guess6ltltendl                                 return 0                                                          count                                                                                                 cout ltlt Count ltltcountltltendl         return 0  codepre  pAnd no, I dont actually have what the final value of count is.

Negative 1603 pI would like to create a class that inherits and acts as a double but is also a handle. For examplep  precodea      myHandleDoubleClass    Instance of my handle double. a.val  1                        Set value of a to 1. b      a                         Assign b to the value of a                                   but, b is a double, not object gtgt b  b       1 codepre  pnow if I change the value of a for example set codea.val  2code then codebcode should also change so that it has the same value or more correctly both a and b are in effect pointers to the same value. p  pIs this possible in Matlab somehowp  pEDIT To further clarify, these handle objects should later on be used as normal doubles and need to act as such for access operations for example codebacode, codebaindcode etc. without having to explicitly access the value property its ok to use the property field to set the value, codea.val  1code. The purpose is to have an double object that is used in many places other objects, including patches and you only have to change the value in one place and all other references update automatically due to the handle property.p  pEXAMPLEp  pOne application would be something like this, crate a patch with vertices of my double classp  precodef  [1 2 3] v  myDoubles  patch faces, f, vertices, v   v.values  updateValues drawnow codepre  pso whenever I change the values at one point, the patch also updates its values without having to explicitly go in and change the vertices field.p
Negative 1603 pWhile testing our site on different devices we found a problem on recent Android versions. There is a bug with textures under the page, where the content ends actually there is no any content where appears the bug. The bug appears only when the height of the page zoomed out is smaller then the screen of a device. Previous Android versions 4.1 etc show there just white space as Apple and Windows mobile devices also do, but 4.4 and later randomly repeats some portions of the site. We tried different viewport metatag options as well as different height100 and minheight100 tricks in CSS with no result.

Negative 1603 pSo Im having this weird issue with Ruby. I created a class called codePathcode that has codestartnodecode and codeendnodecode. Then I created an empty array called codepathscode and added codePathcode objects. When I docodeputs pathscode it prints the list of start nodes and end nodes.

Im not allowed to access codestartnodecode and codeendnodecode of each path inside codepathscode. Heres the basic structure of my codep  precodepath  Path.newstartnode, endnode paths.pushpath  ... puts paths.tos  prints list of paths and each path consists of startnode and endnode  below lines of code prints the addresses paths.each do path     puts path.tos end codepre  pAre we allowed to create objects and add them to an array in Ruby If so, what am I doing wrong here.

So, when building an App with node and express how should I handle the data users, posts, whatever,...p  pI tried to do a whole lot of reading, but Im not having ema clear bigpictureem at which point one layer of abstraction ends and where the next exactly starts. I mean I understand that expressJs is a webFrameWork that sits on the node webserver running on a V8engine, however I am a bit confused of what the final app code should be architectured do I kind of have intermixed nodeJs code with expressJs code in a single app.js Or should I have specific files which require express and another one for the database which does not require itp  pSo now you understand what I mean with strongWhere does express come into node.js What does it do for me which I dont get from pure node and what should I not expect from itstrong p  pMaybe my whole confusion comes because the whole thing is javascript and you dont have like these explicit languagebarriers which make things a bit more obvious Im thinking about the LAMPstack for instance. Or is this exactly the way Im supposed to think about javascript in general Like the only thing which you actually get is a javascriptinterpreter and everything else is lib that we can include and and expressJs simply has nodeJs as a dependency Im really sorry for being so fuzzy.

Negative 1603 pTrying to solve an issue where there is a significant amount of latency on outgoing messages that seems to be related to the socket flush behaviour. Ive been taking packet captures of outgoing FIX messages from a quickfixj initiator to an acceptor. p  pTo summarise the environment, the java intiator makes a socket connection to a server socket on another server. Both servers are running Redhat Enterprise Linux 5.10. The MSS from a netstat on the interfaces is 0. The MTU of the NICs are all 1500 inifinite I believe for the loopback interface. On the application side the messages are encoded into a byte array by quickfixj and written to the socket. The socket is configured with TCPNODELAY enabled. p  pI am almost sure I can eliminate the application as the cause of the latency, as when the acceptor the ServerSocket is run on the same server as the Initiator using the loopback interface, there is no sender latency.

And 2 the measure of latency Im measuring here is the Sending Time set by the message before its encoded, and the packet capture time Time. The packet capture is being done on the same server as the Initiator that is sending the data. For a packet capture of 10,000 packets there is no great difference between SendingTime and Time when using loopback. For this reason I think I can eliminate the application as the cause of the sending latency.p  pWhen the acceptor is moved to another server on the LAN, the sending latency starts to get worse on packets that are greater than the MTU size.

This would be expected as disabling Nagles algorithm will be causing a PUSH to be set on these smaller packets. When the packet size is bigger than the MSS  a packet size of 1514 in this case  the difference between the time the packet is captured and the SendingTime has jumped to 35ms. p  pIt doesnt seem likely that this 35ms latency is caused by the application encoding the messages, as large packet size messages were sent in lt1ms on the loopback interface. The capture also takes place on the sender side, so it doesnt seem that the MTU segmentation that can be the cause either. The most likely reason seems to me that because there is no PUSH flag set  as the packet is larger than the MSS  then the socket andor TCP stack at the OS level is not deciding to flush it until 35ms later. The test acceptor on the other server is not a slow consumer and is on the same LAN, so ACKs are timely.p  pCan anyone give any pointers as to what could cause this socket sending latency for  MSS packets Against a real counterparty in the US this sender latency reaches as high as 300ms. I thought if a packet size was greater than the MSS then it would be sent immediately regardless of previous ACKS as long as the socket buffer size was not exceeded. Netstat generally shows 0 socket q and wind sizes and the issue seems to occur on all  MSS packets, even from startup. This looks like the socket is deciding not to flush immediately for some reason, but unsure what factors could cause that.p  pEdit As pointed out by EJP, there is no flush in linux. The socket send puts the data in the linux kernals network buffers as I understand it. And it seems for these nonpush packets, the kernel is waiting for the ack from the previous packet before it delivers it. This isnt what Id expect, in TCP Id expect the packet to still be delivered until the socket buffers filled up. p

Negative 1603 pIm building a web app that will offer the user N number of modules. These modules are self contained UI components that offer the user discreet functionality. p  pMy question is what the best approach to this scheme is when using Express and Jade. In the past I would have leverage AJAX heavily and render DIVs based on the circumstances manually.  However, since Jade renders everything at once, Im not entirely clear on what the correct approach is in this situation.p  pIdeally each module is its own route and when a user clicks on a given TAB that route is loaded into the associated container and sits there awaiting additional interaction from the user which is handled via AJAX. Then if the user clicks on a different TAB assuming that tab hasnt been loaded yet it follows the same pattern and loads its route as well.p  pIdeally these routes can behave independently if loaded directly into the browser but might also have some global dependencies that they could communicate with in the larger template into which they are being loaded.p

Negative 1603 pI have a JFrame and a JDialog. The latter simply contains a JTextArea. Windows 7 gives now the possiblity to resize a window to the half of the screen by pushing it against the right or the left edge. This works fine with the JFrame window. However, the JDialog window does not react to it, though it is manually resizable. I suppose it is closely connected with the missing maximizeminimize function of JDialogs. On the other hand, creating a JFrame as subframe is not recommmended.

Negative 1603 pI have two Jetsons and I wish to send data to one another using java. I am able to send data to one of the jetsons and read from the port with no problem but when it comes to the other way around, the jetson that is supposed to send a specific data, just ends up sending random data over and over. p  pI opened up putty to see what was being sent without the java program running and I just get these random lines and occasional characters.  I am using the pins 65 RX and 68 TX on the IO expansion header.they were working fine and then all of a sudden random data was being sent. When I opened putty I changed the baud rate to 115200 and then after closing it, the system froze. I rebooted and then it started to work normally again but today I was writing some code using threads so that one of the Jetsons could continously listen to its RX port, after multiple failes, the same thing happened againthe other jetson keeps sending random data. I did a loopback test on the Jetson that was sending the random data, and I was able to echo back my own input from the keyboard. Then when I connected the wire back to the other Jetsons RX, random data was still being sent.p  pThe Jetsons loopback test are a success but when connecting to each other, thats when the problem occurs.Can someone help me outp

Negative 1603 pI have a JavaFX BubbleChart in my visualization and I need to be able to createdisplay text within each bubble of the chart. In my visualization, I have numerous XYChart.Series with only 1 bubble per series. For each series, I do series.setNamexxxx where xxxx  unique series name and I need to be able to display that series name inside the bubble.p  pI already have implemented a Tooltip mouseover event for the Bubble Chart that displays the series name, but I need to also have the text visible inside the bubble without requiring a mouseover. p  pFor the sake of having code to work against, here is a basic example with 5 series.

Negative 1603 pI want to understand the usage of BARs in the PCIe Root Complex. The PCIe Root Complex is already a part of the CPU as a peripheral to it. And the CPU register spaces is easily accessible. CPU has register to access its various peripheral link PCIe controller, DIMM Controller, USB Controllers etc.  So in this case what is the usage of BAR inside the PCIe RC Config space p  pSecondly I want to understand how the PCIe RC is setup during enumeration with the proper memory windows.  For example lets say I have a PCIe device EP directly connected to the RC. And in the Config space of EP programmed with some address X with some size s. So basically, any readwrite from the CPU to the window of X and X s, should go to the PCIe EP. But this should go through the PCIe RC. Now how the RC knows that it should it should translate the CPU readwrite to that memory window into PCIe transaction to the EP  How does the RC is configured to do that  Are there any standardized register in PCIe RC where this information is kept p  pSGp

Negative 1603 pI have a system built of many modules that use AJAX to do POSTs and GETs.

Negative 1603 pThis is my JSON variable.p  pvar myObj  A B C 1  p  pI have a variable dynKey whose value is dynamically set to the JSON key. For example it could be A or A.B or A.B.C the later 2 signifying nested keyp  pdynKey  A.B.Cp  pso I tried myObj[dynKey] and obviously it does not work as it creates a new key named A.B.C. How can I access a nested key with a variablep  pThanksp
