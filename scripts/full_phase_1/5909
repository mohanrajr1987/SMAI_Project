Positive 5909 pI want to implement a realtime system in which events are triggered at known times.  I could use System.Timers.Timer, and at the end of each event calculate when the next event happens and go into a sleep mode until it occurs some milliseconds later.p  pThe question is, is this the only option I have available or is there a way for events to Trigger after a known time, without starting hundreds of Timersp  pThe reason for the question is, while I expect each event to execute very quickly, its possible that an events start  duration will exceed the next events start, and I dont want that.  Therefore, whatever you suggest has to be independent of the code that executes.p
Positive 5909 pIm aware that return values from codesetTimeoutcode and codesetIntervalcode are unique within a given DOM at least for timers running at that moment, but once one of these timers finishes or is cancelled is the same number ever reused What about for example codesetTimeoutcode outputting a number which codesetIntervalcode has already given, or similarp  pMy instinct is that I can rely on them never being reused. Otherwise Id feel the need to clear variables pointing to a timer identifier as soon as the timer ends or I cancel it, lest some other code attempt to cancel it later when it is pointing to an unrelated timer which has by chance been assigned the same identifier.p  pAssuming they are not supposed to be reused, are there any browsers which misbehavep

Positive 5909 pGood evening fellas,p  pI am having some problems with a Countdown timer. My app should do the following, it starts and checks if there exists one file with one date on it, if so it calculates the difference between today and that future date and initializes a timer counting down the seconds until that date in the way X days Y hours Z minutes S seconds. If theres no file, then the user can select one date with the botton, the program will store it in the file and set the countdown. There is also one Delete Button which allows to delete the date and choice another. This delete button should cancel the timer so it stops counting.p  pFor some unknown reason the timer does not stop when I cancel it. Apart from that my timer is ticking properly but the difference is 2 seconds instead of one... so it would show 40 38 36... instead of 40 39 38...p  pAnd lastly, its storing the picked date twice instead of one...p  pIf someone could take a look at my code I would really appreacite, I am a newbie in Android and I have been the whole afternoon struggling with this without result... p  pThe DatePicker code is from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma18672134herea, I dont like taking credit from things that arent mine.p  pThanks in advance.p  precodepublic class NextVisit extends Activity implements DatePickerFragment.TheListener protected Vibrator vibrate protected int SECONDSINADAY  24  60  60 protected String filePath   protected SimpleDateFormat formatter  new SimpleDateFormatyyyyMMdd final long[] pattern  0, 1000, 500, 1000, 500, 1000, 500, 1000  CountDownTimer timer  null String dateString    Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitynextvisit     final TextView label  TextView findViewByIdR.id.label     final TextView countdown  TextView findViewByIdR.id.timevisit     final Button bDate  Button findViewByIdR.id.datebutton     final Button bDelete  Button findViewByIdR.id.deletebutton     File dir  new FilegetFilesDir, loveApp     ifdir.exists         dir.mkdirs     final File f   new FilegetFilesDirloveApplovedate.txt     filePath  f.getAbsolutePath     vibrate  Vibrator getSystemServiceVIBRATORSERVICE     bDelete.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              iff.exists                 f.delete                 System.out.printlnFile deleted successfully                 bDate.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE                 label.setTextR.string.nextvisit1                 timer.cancel                 countdown.setText                 System.out.printlnI cancelled the timer                  bDelete.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE                 bDate.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener                      public void onClickView v                          DialogFragment picker  new DatePickerFragment                         bDelete.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE                         bDate.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE                         picker.showgetFragmentManager, datePicker                                                                        iff.exists         System.out.printlnFile exists         bDate.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE         label.setTextgetStringR.string.label         try             BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew FileReaderf             dateString  br.readLine             br.close             System.out.printlnDate dateString             Date finalDate  formatter.parsedateString             setCountdownfinalDate         catchException e             e.printStackTrace             label.setTextERROR               else         System.out.printlnFile DOES NOT EXIST         bDelete.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE Removing the delete date button         bDate.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener              public void onClickView v                  DialogFragment picker  new DatePickerFragment                 bDelete.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE                 bDate.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE                 picker.showgetFragmentManager, datePicker                          public void setCountdownDate finishDate     long end  finishDate.getTime     final TextView countdown  TextView  findViewByIdR.id.timevisit     timer  new CountDownTimerend, 1000         Override         public void onTicklong millisUntilFinished              long now  Calendar.getInstanceLocale.GERMANY.getTimeInMillis1000             long diff   millisUntilFinished  now             long diffSec  diff  1000              long days  diffSec  SECONDSINADAY             long secondsDay  diffSec  SECONDSINADAY             long seconds  secondsDay  60             long minutes  secondsDay  60  60             long hours  secondsDay  3600             countdown.setTextdays  days,  hours  hours, minutes  m, seconds  s remaining                   Override         public void onFinish              countdown.setTextdone             vibrate.vibratepattern,1              .start      Override public void returnDateString date      dateString  date     TextView label  TextView findViewByIdR.id.label     label.setTextR.string.label     BufferedWriter bw     try          bw  new BufferedWriternew FileWriternew FilefilePath         bw.writedateString         bw.close         System.out.printlnSaved the file, date is  dateString         Date finishDate  formatter.parsedate         setCountdownfinishDate      catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace        codepre

Positive 5909 pI have found a couple of answers for this question, but they are not very helpful. I am trying to create an app that has a running stopwatch timer in each cell of a tableview, using standard subtitle cells. The timer name is displayed in the textfield and the running timer is displayed in the subtitle. Each cell needs to display a different time format seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years. The calculation of the time elapsed since the timer was started is done each time the timer expires, and the result is put into the cells subtitle. The code works fine as long as only one timer is used. However, if a second timer is started, the running timer in the first cell is reset to zero. I believe this is because I am saving a pointer to the cell dequeued at cellForRowAtIndexPath and using this pointer to populate the cell when the timer expires. This probably violates MVC. However, as my view controller delegate implements the protocol, I have to return a cell when the tableview requests it, and I cant do that until the timer expires so that I can update the subtitle in the cell. I dont see any way to do this without saving a pointer to the cell containing the output of the running timer. I am new to iOS development but I have written this project both programmatically and recently using a storyboard and get the same results. The code for the view controller is below. Note that the item.timerType is set from another view controller that is segued in the storyboard with the data passed back to the main view controller. That part works ok.p  pThanks for any helpp  precode       timerItem.h   LifeLogger    Created by Nelson Capes on 92415.   Copyright  2015 Nelson Capes.

Positive 5909 pMy boss wants a PHP countdown from a particular date with jquery.p  pTo explain, lets say the end date is 101515. He wants there to a counter that starts with data from a PHP server and then counts down with jquery. The data needs to start with PHP so users dont manipulate their time settings on their computer. The format needs to be in days, hours, minutes, seconds. Once the counter is equal to zero, a value needs to be sent to the server to communicate the contest has been ended.p

When the one timer is working on the click of button to other timer will not start on again clicking the start button. 2. And when i come back to the activity and click the stop button the timer should stop.p  pHere is my codep  precodepublic class GPSTrackingActivity extends Activity   Timer timer TimerTask timerTask    final Handler handler  new Handler   GPSTracker class GPStracker gps double longitude, latitude Button showLocation1,timerstopped,starttimer  protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState   super.onCreatesavedInstanceState  setContentViewR.layout.activitygpstracking  showLocation1  Button findViewByIdR.id.showlocation1    show location button click event  showLocation1.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView arg0                       create class object              create class object             gps  new GPStrackerGPSTrackingActivity.this               check if GPS enabled                  ifgps.canGetLocation                  double latitude  gps.getLatitude                 double longitude  gps.getLongitude                   n is for new line                 Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Your Location is  nLat   latitude  nLong   longitude, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                 else                  cant get location                  GPS or Network is not enabled                  Ask user to enable GPSnetwork in settings                 gps.showSettingsAlert                              starttimer Button findViewByIdR.id.starttimer    stop showing location button click event  starttimer.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView arg0                                create class object             startTimer              Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Your tracking is now started  , Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                  timerstopped Button findViewByIdR.id.timerstopped    stop showing location button click event  timerstopped.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener             Override         public void onClickView arg0              timer.cancel             timerTask.cancel               Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Your tracking is now stopped  , Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                    public void startTimer               set a new Timer                  timer  new Timer            initialize the TimerTasks job                 gpsmethod                    schedule the timer, after the first 1000ms the TimerTask will run every min              timer.scheduletimerTask, 1000, 10000              public void gpsmethod      timerTasknew TimerTask           Override         public void run               TODO Autogenerated method stub             handler.postnew Runnable                   Override                 public void run                       TODO Autogenerated method stub                     GPStracker gps  new GPStrackerGPSTrackingActivity.this                     call your function for getting lat n lon                      double latitude  gps.getLatitude                    double longitude  gps.getLongitude                     Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Your Location is  nLat   latitude  nLong   longitude, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                                codepre
Positive 5909 pI have a windows service that I coded last week, its intention is to run a timer that checks periodically if the date has changed, if so it kicks off a method to get objects from our SQL server and if they match the current date it sends them off to another service that processes the payment.

The next step my tutorial says is to build and then it should create a MyService.exe however when I search through my solutions files and folders I cant find this exe so Im not sure why this isnt being created on build Am I going about this the wrong way Should I be kicking this off with Windows Task Scheduler or should I create an installer and install it on our server to run in the background consistently Thanks for any information or helpp

And it will trigger an PropertyChanged event. As I said, when doing it this way, inside an buttonpress event, the style does actually change .  But when I initialize the timer inside the codeMainWindowcode function. It will give a lot of errors.p  pI actually have another Timer which gets initialized inside an button press event, and this timer is able to change the style.p  pSo, the timer cant change the style when its inside the Initializer of the window. But it can change the style when the timer is initialized inside a button press event. p  pAnyone a solution on how to change the style.p

Positive 5909 pIn codejavax.swing.Timercode, we are allowed to set the emtime intervalem as suchp  precodeint delay  1000    update every 1000 millisecond Timer t  new Timerdelay, listener codepre  pWith the above, I will expect the time delay between each interval to be code1000code millisecond. However I when I use it in a Swing application, the delay for each interval is code1014 to 1015code.p  pWhen I set the delay to code1code. The tested delay is code15 to 16code milliseconds per interval.p  hr  pI have 2 question with regards to the above Timer behaviourp  pstrongQ1strong What is causing the additional code14 to 15code milliseconds being added to my interval Is it the overhead needed to run the Swing applicationp  pstrongQ2strong Will the time delay be guaranteed as what we have stated in the Timer constructor or codetimer.setDelaycode I ask this because I know the delay in codeThread.sleepdelaycode is not guaranteed, and it varies with a range.

Negative 5909 pWe currently have developed an application using WCF. Our clients make connections to different WCF servicehosts located on the server, and the servicehosts return the data from the DB that the clients need. Standard model. However, this current design has all of our WCF data in app.config files both on the client side as well as the servicehost side. We want to make this more dynamic, and have moved all of the data, including the endpoints, the contracts, and the bindings, into the DB.p  pNow the question is how do we retrieve this data, and access it properly. Weve got the design working where we have one defined endpoint in a config file, and using that endpoint, we can make a call to it to get the rest of the endpoint information that we need i.e. all of the bindings, contracts and different endpoints that it used to have defined in its app.config. This is the case on both the client side as well as the servicehost side.p  pThe issue that Im now struggling with is how do I code against these dynamic endpoints When the client makes a call to the servicehost, it not only is making simple calls to the servicehost, but retrieving and passing back objects for the servicehost to process as needed. For example, on form load we may retrieve the object with all of the currently defined settings from the DB, and then the user does whatever on the fornm, and we then pass back the updated object to the servicehost. We can do that now because in Visual Studio 2008 weve added all of the service references, which has autogenerated the methods and objects that can be called and retrieved from the servicehosts. If we go to a dynamic endpoint connection, how do we get this data during the development phasep  pIve developed a similar application in the past in .NET 2.0 using .NET remoting, where we were passing the object back and forth, and the client and server both used the same object definition class to know about the object. Im not sure how we would go about doing this with WCF.p

Only 10 or so controls are in fact in view, the rest are not the codeFlowLayoutPanel.AutoScrollcode is set to codetruecode. As a result, it tries to retrieve thumbnails for all the images and that takes a long time.pli lipAdding the codeUserControlcode objects to the codeFlowLayoutPanelcode takes a somewhat long time, about 23 seconds.

Negative 5909 pI have a codeUITableViewcode with some empty sections. Id like the user to be able to move a row into them using the standard edit mode controls. The only way I can do it so far is to have a dummy row in my empty sections and try to hide it by using codetableViewheightForRowAtIndexPathcode to give the dummy row a height of zero. This seems to leave it as a 1pixel row.

Frequently we need to change the DSV associated to a particular SDML, but we only found its reference in one place the Data Source View Name property availabe through the VS properties pane of the sdml file.p  pWe found absolutly no reference to it anywhere else, not even in the sdml xml code view. But, strangly enough, VS asks to check out the sdml file when we change that Data Source View Name property ... then makes no change to the checked out file.p  pFinally, when we close the project and reopen it, VS forgets that property setting. This behavior points to some kind of inmemoryonly saving location for that setting ... p  pAre we missing something or does anybody noticed similar behaviorp  pThanks. Bruno Lopesp

Negative 5909 pSay that I have a web user control that has several drop down lists in it. They are all set to AutoPostBack  true, BUT each SelectedIndexChanged event handler in my control will firechain the other SelectedIndexChanged handlers I have defined for the other DDLs. This means that when the user changes a single DDL, the event handlers are chainedfired for several other DDLs. The logic for which events are chained is very complicated, data driven, and can change depending on which list was actually changed by the user. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine which event handler would fire last.p  pFrom the pages point of view, I want to subscribe to a single SelectionChanged Event on the user control that will only fire one time per postback and not until all of the  event handlers have fired. I dont care which event handlers have fired, only that the state of the control as a whole has changed.p  pIm using C 3.5ASP.NET 2.0VisualStudio 2008p  pHow can I go about doing thisp  pEDIT Moved clarification into original description. I think the fact that I specified AutoPostBacktrue without specifying that chaining was happening was misleading. I apologize for the confusion. p

Negative 5909 pCurrently our .NET application constructs XML data in memory that we persist to a SQL Server database. The XElement object is converted to a string using ToString and then stored in a varcharMAX column in the DB. We dindt want to use the SQL XML datatype as we didnt need any validation and SQL doesnt need to query the XML at any stage.p  pAlthough this implementation works fine, we want to reduce the size of the database by compressing the XML before storing it, and decompressing it after retrieving it. Does anyone have any sample code for compressing an XElement object and decompressing would be great too Also, what changes would I need to make to the data type of the database column so that we can fully take advantage of this compressionp  pI have investigated again the XML datatype SQL Server 2005 offers, and the validation overhead it offers is too high for us to consider using it. Also, although it does compress the XML somewhat, it doesnt as much compression as the .NET DeflateStream class.p  pI have tested the DeflateStream class by writing the XML we use to disk, and then saving the comrpessed version as a new file. The results are great, a 16kb file goes down to a 3kb file, so its jsut a case of getting this to work in memory and saving the resulting data to the DB. Does anyone have any sample code to do the compression, and should I change the varcahrMAX colum to type to maybe varbinaryp  pThanks in advancep

If I dont specify all of the columns in the EntityMapping an exception is thrown in the call to getResultList.p  pMy question is this Is it possible to only specify the columns in the EntityMapping that are selected in the query rather than having to specify all from the entities p

This means most of the time the file read wont go near the disk, but will read the portion of the file from the system cache.p  pBeing able to concurrently access this file will significantly improve performance of certain algorithms in my code.p  pSo, there are two questions herep  ol liIs it possible for windows to concurrently access the same file from different threadsli liIf so, how do you provide this ability Ive tried creating the temp file and opening the file again to provide two file handles, but the second open does not succeed.li ol  pHeres the createp  precodeFFileSystem  CreateFilePCharFFileName,                           GENERICREAD  GENERICWRITE,                           FILESHAREREAD  FILESHAREWRITE,                           nil,                           CREATEALWAYS,                           FILEATTRIBUTENORMAL OR                           FILEFLAGRANDOMACCESS OR                           FILEATTRIBUTETEMPORARY OR                           FILEFLAGDELETEONCLOSE,                           0 codepre  pHeres the second openp  precodeFFileSystem2  CreateFilePCharFFileName,                           GENERICREAD,                           FILESHAREREAD,                           nil,                           OPENEXISTING,                           FILEATTRIBUTENORMAL OR                           FILEFLAGRANDOMACCESS OR                           FILEATTRIBUTETEMPORARY OR                           FILEFLAGDELETEONCLOSE,                           0 codepre  pIve tried various combinations of the flags with no success so far. The second file open always fails, with messages to the affect that the file cannot be accessed as it is in use by another process.p  pEdit p  pOK, some more information I was hoping to not get lost in the weeds here...p  pThe process in question is a Win32 server process running on WinXP 64. Its maintaining large spatial databases and would like to keep as much of the spatial database as possible in memory in an L1L2 cache structure. L1 already exists. L2 exists as a temporary file that stays in the windows system cache its somewhat of a dirty trick, but gets around win32 memory limitations somewhat. Win64 means I can have lots of memory used by the system cache so memory used to hold the L2 cache does count towards process memory.p  pMultiple potentially many threads want to concurrently access information contained in the  L2 cache. Currently, access is serialised, which means one thread gets to read its data while most or the rest of the threads are blocked pending completion of that operation.p  pThe L2 cache file does get written to, but Im happy to globally serialiseinterleave read and write type operations as long as I can perform concurrent reads.p  pIm aware there are nasty potential thread concurrency issues, and Im aware there are dozens of ways to skin this cat in other contexts. I have this particular context, and Im trying to determine if there is a way to permit concurrent thread read access within the file and within the same process.p  pAnother approach I have considered would be two split the L2 cache into multiple temporary files, where each file serialises thread access the way the current single L2 cache file does.p  pAnd yes, this somewhat desparate approach is because 64 bit Delphi wont be with us any time soon p  pThanks, Raymond.p

Negative 5909 pEDIT  not getting much input on this so heres the skinny.  Im posting keyboard events to a PSN.  I then switch to another window, post some more events this time tat session level and switch back to the first window.  When I start posting to the PSN again, nothing happens.  Until I move the mouse or scroll wheel.  Why would this be the case and how can I work around it if not fix itp  pORIGINAL  If I set up a loop that posts some keyboard events to a PSN, I find that it works fine except for when first launched.  The event only seems to post when i do something with the mouse manually  even just moving it slightly.  Heres the details, if they help.p  pAn external application has a list box of text lines, which I am reading by posting copy commands and checking the pasteboard.  Unfortunately this is my only way to get this text.p  pSometimes, the application pulls focus away from the list, which I can detect.  When this happens, the most reliable way to return focus is by sending a mouse event to click on a text field directly above the list, then send a tab keyboard event to shift the focus onto the list.p  pSo at launch, the loop runs fine, scrolling down the list and copying the text.  When focus is shifted away, its is detected fine, and the events are sent to move focus back to the list.  But nothing seems to happen.  The loop continues detecting that focus has changed, but the events only work once I move the mouse.  Or even just use the scroll wheel.  Strange.p  pOnce this has happened the first time, it works fine  each time focus moves, the PSN events switch it back without me having to do anything at all.p  pHeres the code that runs in the loop  verified as workingp  precode    copy to pasteboard  CMDV e3  CGEventCreateKeyboardEventNULL, CGKeyCode8, true CGEventSetFlagse3, kCGEventFlagMaskCommand CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e3 CFReleasee3 e4  CGEventCreateKeyboardEventNULL, CGKeyCode8, false CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e4 CFReleasee4  move cursor down e1  CGEventCreateKeyboardEventNULL, CGKeyCode125, true CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e1 CFReleasee1 e2  CGEventCreateKeyboardEventNULL, CGKeyCode125, false CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e2 CFReleasee2 codepre  pAnd heres where I switch focus, also working except when first requiredp  precode    click in text input box  point is derived earlier e6  CGEventCreateMouseEventNULL, kCGEventLeftMouseDown, point, 0 CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e6 CFReleasee6 e7  CGEventCreateMouseEventNULL, kCGEventLeftMouseUp, point, 0 CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e7 CFReleasee7  press tab key to move to chat log table CGEventRef e  CGEventCreateKeyboardEventNULL, CGKeyCode48, true CGEventPostkCGSessionEventTap, e CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e CFReleasee CGEventRef e11  CGEventCreateKeyboardEventNULL, CGKeyCode48, false CGEventPostToPSNamppsn, e11 CFReleasee11  codepre

Negative 5909 pI would like to force a user to complete some additional information once they have created and account and have validated their email address.  For now, this additional information is simple first name, last name.  Once a user logs in, I am going to redirect them to an additional information page to complete this information.  Im just wondering what the best way is to ensure that this information is completed.  The only thing I can think of is to store some type of flag in the session, but I would have to look at it for every single get of a view right  I cant think of any other way to do this, since I would need to check every page get, but maybe a base controller or something would be best  Im really looking for best practices here.

Negative 5909 pIm struggling to figure out how to compare MySQL dates with current system time using perl.p  pI have a script that runs on a cron job that will send notification if the current system datetime is past the datetime of a returned recordp  pAn application displays a table viewp  precodeEventId    Device        Location  CC 123    something     BFE TT 456    anotherthing  BFE codepre  pHow the script works is it finds values in the field EventID, parses the type CC, TT, etc from the ID the numeric portion.  The ID is a Unique ID in another databasetable which contains an end time field. EventID itself is not Unique and may have duplicate items in the table. Sub routines for each type exist since each type has a different database andor table.p  pThe goal is that the script runs every minute and toggles the value of Expired.

Negative 5909 pI am going to develop a WCF service that connects backend system with two ecommerce websites. Backend system sits behind the internet as opposed to other components. Each website has a SQL database with identical schema. The backend system acting as inventory master will be the service consumer and will be pushing product data to each website database through this service. The question is how to determine where to store the data Say I use entity framework as data access layer. The service data access will then have to use one or the other connection string to store data pushed by the backend consumer. Another option would be to include a parameter to every contract operation and service code will then decide where to store the data. Last option I can think of is to deploy two instances of the service alternatively define two service endpoints but since the transport is abstracted this may not be quite possible and let consumer call the correct endpoint. Can you please advise which if any solution is correct and most efficient requiring to write least code and providing simplest deployment process Also should I use http or net.tcp bindings in my scenariop

Negative 5909 pIm trying to render a 3D ribbon using a single 3D cubic Bzier curve to describe it the width of the ribbon is some constant.

Negative 5909 pLets say I have an enum class  codeConfigElementcode which has some members like codeGENERALCONFIGGeneral Configurationcode, codeTRANSITTIMESTransit timescode.p  pAll of these config elements individual classes, implement a common interface codeConfigElementOPcode, for examplep  precodepublic class TransitTimesOp implements ConfigElementsOp     implementation of interface methods  codepre  pThese individual classes define a certain behaviour which is particular to them.p  pNow, the controller of the application just gets the particular codeConfigElementcode, and then with the help of a factory, finds out the class which has the corresponding behaviour and uses it accordingly.p  pCurrently, my factory is just a static map between the codeConfigElementcode and its behaviour class, like p  precodepublic static MapltConfigElement, ConfigElementsOpgt ConfigElementBehaviourMap       new HashMapltConfigElement, ConfigElementsOpgt  ConfigElementBehaviourMap.putConfigElement.TRANSITTIMES, TransitTimesOp.class ... codepre  pI have two concerns with thisp  ol lipIs this the correct design for the factory Seems messier to me, as addition of any new element and behaviour would require changes in multiple places and the miss to include it in this static map, would be silently ignored by the compiler.pli lipLets say we go with this design of the factory static map, is there any way of enforcing that any new class defined for a config element, makes an entry into this map. And any such miss, would be a compile time error.pli ol  pUsage can be described in the following way   Various controllers will require a different behavioural map of this enum. So, lets say  UI controller will have one map which states how to display a particular ConfigElement, Serializer will have another map at its disposal, which is a map between the ConfigElement and its particular serializer.  Particular controllers when in work will get the corresponding behaviour for a ConfigElement from their map and use it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5909 pIve implemented a GUI system heavily inspired by WPFs Measure and Arrange layout system for a game. Although it works fine with DockPanels and StackPanels, Ive recently needed to use WrapPanels. I discovered that, in its present state, my GUI system cannot support wrapping because I would need to know the maximum available size based on the ancestors, and my measurement is currently done without that information. p  pIve checked the WPF documentation and found out that their codeMeasurecode method takes a size constraint as a parameter codeSize MeasureSize availableSizecode. This puzzles me. From my understanding of it, WPF first does measurement from the leaves to the root and then the arrangement from the root to the leaves. However, in this instance, the available size from the ancestors is needed while in the measurement phase. This seems contradictory to me as the size of the ancestors depend on the size of their descendants.p  pHow does WPF provide this codeavailableSizecode value in the measurement passp

From time to time, I go to the DUnit test application to add some tests and run existing one.p  pSome test code generates exceptions which are handled by the application, but displayed multiple time by the Delphi Debugger as Im used to running the test application using the kbdF9kbd shortcut like I do with standard application this is not very handy in that case.p  pI know about the kbdSHIFTkbdkbdCTRLkbdkbdF9kbd shortcut to run without debugging and thats great when I strongrememberstrong to use it but I often find myself hitting kbdF9kbd, then grunting, then closing the test application, then hitting kbdSHIFTkbdkbdCTRLkbdkbdF9kbd. What a lost of time.p  pSo my question is there a better way  Can I define some settings or use some expert to make that particular application run without debugging by default  Surely Im not the only one having this issue.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 5909 pIm new to web development and have started using JSONP and Googles Feed API to get the RSS articles using client side javascript.

I hope its not as bad as having to download the web pages html and looking for gif and png links.p  pAny helps is appreciatedp

Negative 5909 pIve just upgraded to IntelliJ IDEA 10, and it has started doing something extremely annoying.  While writing documentation in a .txt file it has started giving me word suggestions as I type.  This is, instead of helping, just irritating me while also consuming system resources.  I havent been able to find a way to turn this off in the Settings window.  Perhaps theres a way of telling Idea not to do this for certain file types or in code commentsp  pCheers,p  pRp

Negative 5909 pIs there a way to find the width of text in Javascript jQuery is used, so happy to take advantage of any functions they provide for a hidden elementp  pI want to have a graph of nodes.  Each node has text inside and I want the nodes to have a width that accommodates the text up to a limit.  So I essentially create hidden codeltdivgtcodes with some html inside.  Then I use jQuery to display those codeltdivgtcodes on the graph at the right spots.  Its important that I know the correct width ahead of time so I can construct the graph properly.p  pstrongemUPDATEemstrong Just to clarify, I need to know how wide some text is while its hidden.  Blender gave an answer below, Im hoping theres a less tricky wayp

Negative 5909 pIm trying to rotate an image in Python using PIL and having the expand argument to true. It seems that when the background of my image is black, the resulting image saved as a bmp will be a lot smaller than if I have a white background for my image, and then I replace the black due to expand with white. In either case, my original image is always of two colors, and right now i need the file size to be small, since Im putting these images on an embedded device. p  pAny ideas if i can force rotate to fill in another color when expanding or if there is another way to rotate my picture in order to make it smallp
Negative 5909 pIve set up a Django project in which i create random points.

If i readout the values they are not connected anymore and sorting x would mix up the point set.

I know its Java, and were not into the whole brevity thing, but thats a little much. Not to mention the jars are up to 700KB.p  pAnyway, enough ranting, I wanted to see what kind of experiences people have had with other HTTP client librariesp  pThe ones Im aware of are a hrefhttpdocs.codehaus.orgdisplayJETTYJettyHTTPClientJettya, a hrefhttphotpotato.biasedbit.comhotpotatoa, and a hrefhttpsgithub.comsonatypeasynchttpclientAsyncHttpClienta.p  pThis is for serverside use, Im mostly interested in performance for many concurrent gets and large file transfers.p  pAny recommendationsp  pPS I know the venerable HttpClient 3.1 is still there, but Id like to use something thats supported.p  h3Updateh3  poleg this is what the docs suggestp  precode    HttpClient httpclient  new DefaultHttpClient     try          HttpGet httpget  new HttpGethttpwww.apache.org         HttpResponse response  httpclient.executehttpget         HttpEntity entity  response.getEntity         if entity  null              InputStream instream  entity.getContent             try                  instream.read              catch IOException ex                  throw ex              catch RuntimeException ex                  httpget.abort                 throw ex              finally                  try  instream.close  catch Exception ignore                             finally          httpclient.getConnectionManager.shutdown      codepre  pI still get unexpected errors when consuming entity content when using codeThreadSafeClientConnManagercode. Im sure its my fault, but at this point I dont really want to have to figure it out.p  pHey, I dont mean to disparage anyones work here, but Ive been making a goodfaith effort to use HttpComponents since 4.0 came out and its just not working for me.p

Negative 5909 pIve created a toast style activity window class that I can add very simply by creating an instance of the class, then initiating it with the nib toastView.xib and adding it as a subview to the current view.p  pWhat I want to do is simplify this so that I only have to initiate the instance. Then, to conserve memory, Id like it to only add the subview when I pop up the toast. Currently, I do this with one of two methods, but for simplicity just assume it is codevoidloadWithLabelNSString labelStringcode When this happens, I think the current View Controller must pass the toastView the current main view. Based on this view, I would like the toastView class to add itself as a subview, so I have to do less work to implement this toast window in View Controllers further down the line. If you guys have any suggestions that would be most welcome Sorry about the verbosity, its kind of confusing p  pThanks in advancep  pemSummary of the desired behavioremp  pemMy current View Controller call it currentView allocates and initializes an instance of toastView class call it toast. When the toast is needed, currentView sends something like code[toast loadToastInViewself.view]code after which codetoastcode inserts itself into codecurrentView.viewcode at index 0. After a set time or on method call, codetoastcode releases its view from its superView, currentView until its called upon again.emp

Negative 5909 pIve been looking into this for a while and have been unable to find a concrete solution.p  pIm trying to detect when a user has started using their internet 3G, Wifi.

I am not simply looking to see if a connection is available.p  pOne solution that Ive been thinking would be to create my own intent but Ive been unable to find any good documentation on how to create your own intent filter.  most tutorials Ive seen say to usespecify your own Intent, but neglect to say how to create the intent Because of this, Im assuming its something simple that people dont feel is worth mentioning.p  pThe idea behind using an intent was so that I could trigger code to execute on the event that the user is using the internet, not just connected to it.

Negative 5909 pIs there any FireFox plugin which acts the same as IE8 developer tools in a way that it has an option to switch from different modes or versions p  pI had many issues when installing different versions of FireFox in just one machine. I now have 3.0, 3.6, 4.0.1 and 5.0.1 of FF but I got a problem regarding addons, it seems like they share just one location where addons are in. p  pIf I open FF 3.0, since some addons are latest version for 4.0.1 and are not compatible with FF 3.0, it will disable them, then when I go back to the later version, addons which was disabled by the older FF will be gone. p  pAnyway my platform is Windows 7 32bit.p

Negative 5909 pTLDR Im using jQuery code.csscode to set the background color of an element, but I need to preserve csss codehovercode functionality.p  hr  pI am using a hrefhttpwww.marghoobsuleman.comjqueryimagedropdown relnofollowa jQuery plugina to enable imbedding images into a set of dropdowns. It does this by changing the dropdown options into a series of nested codedivcode and codeacode elements with a good amount of additional styling. On my site, these dropdowns are used for selecting elements to customize the appearance of a products preview before customers make their purchase. The images added are thumbnails of the selections available to the customer.p  pThat all works great, except that one of the customization options includes partiallytransparent images of black, gold, and silver that are overlaid atop another customization. Basically no background color works to get them all to show up, so we are using jQuery to set the background color of the overlaid component to match the color of the item selected for the background component. Some will not show up well, but those will also show up poorly in the preview and in the final product, so it is fine if they look bad.p  pAll of that works using this codep  precodefunction changeSelectionid, selection, color       other unrelated code      update color of overlay to match background selection     if id  SelectBackground          update background color         SelectOverlaytitle.cssbackgroundcolor, color         SelectOverlaychild gt a.cssbackgroundcolor, color         SelectOverlaychild gt a.selected.cssbackgroundcolor, 66CCFF          update text color  white for dark backgrounds black for light         if color.substring1, 2 gt 1 ampamp color.substring1, 2 lt 7              SelectInsigniatitle.csscolor, FFFFFF             SelectInsigniachild gt a.csscolor, FFFFFF          else              SelectInsigniatitle.csscolor, 000000             SelectInsigniachild gt a.csscolor, 000000             SelectInsigniachild gt a.selected.csscolor, FFFFFF                codepre  pThe problem, however, is that after applying these changes, the codeSelectOverlay ahovercode css no longer fires to provide the customer with visual feedback about which selection they are currently over.p  pI briefly considered applying the changes through swapping out css classes instead of calling code.csscode but that becomes problematic when you consider the potential for dozens of different background colors, each of which is pulled dynamically from the database.p  pSo...what can I do to preserve the codeSelectOverlay ahovercode effects after changing the background color in jQueryp

If I put the get and set methods for fido in it clears up. The second error occurs with  synthesize fido. It says property must be declared in the implementation. Everything is copied correctly out of the book and near as I can tell, it looks just like all the other uses of property and synthesize I have looked at. Anyone have any ideas on what I am missing or doing wrongp  pXcode 4.1 automatically creates a delegate class which I usually ignore if I am not working on delegates. I created my own class for the KVC exercise and just added the propertysynthesize declarations to it with appropriate modifications and got the errors. I just put the propertysynthesize declarations into the delegate class, moved my IBAction code to the appropriate places, redid the bindings, and erased the class I created and everything worked fine. Do propertysynthesize declarations need to be treated like delegate materialp

Negative 5909 pIm developing an app that mainly uses the German language. Because of that, I would like to have the iOS Simulator to be set to German language by default. If I start the iOS Simulator having the language of MacOS set to German, the Menu language of the Simulator is German, but the language inside the simulated iOS is English. I know, that I can change the language within the simulated iOS. But thats not what Im looking for, because after a reset of the simulator I have to set the language again, and also changing the simulated language seems to be very buggy in iOS 4.2 frequently leading to hard crashes of MacOS.p  pIs there a way maybe via the command line to permanently change the default language of the simulator p  pMany thanks in advance.p

He replied by stating that its common practice to serve different CSS strongemandstrong different markupsem depending on the device width.p  pThis approach still seems a bit strange to me, because if youre willing to rewrite your whole HTML markup you might as well use the same grid system 16 for instance and just change all your code.gridxcode classes to code.gridx2code to accommodate smaller screens... Rightp  pThe adapt.js approach seems easier to implement and manage, but I can spot a few caveats too how will an image or snippet of text fit nicely inside a codegrid3code class Being that its width can range from codeautocode, to code220pxcode to even code610pxcode in the a hrefhttpadapt.960.gsassetscss2520.css2520.cssa variantp  pSo, what is the current best practice regarding responsive web design and grid systems And should CSS media queries affect the grid column widths As it is, Im inclined to believe that the best approach might be to serve a single markup and stylesheet and let the browser do its rendering  scaling.p  pIm pretty green at this, so any help is appreciated  thanks.p

Negative 5909 pSorry for the badly worded title, and I would also like to apologize in advance if my explanation is lackluster. My knowledge of JavaScript and Ajax stuff isnt really that great.p  pAnyway, so, what I am trying to do is display a list of items using PHP, and then when an item is clicked, a popup will be displayed basically asking if the users want to add the items to the DB its essentially importing from one DB to another. Part of the popup is a drop down list that contains possible parents for the imported items. So, if you are importing a project called Vista, you might place it in the parent category OS. p  pIn order to make the drop down, an ajax request must be made, and the back end PHP replies with a JSON object which contains all elements that need to be included in the drop down. p  pSo, as a test to see if the AJAX connection works, I just arbitrarily place a button on the window like sop  precodeltdiv aligncenter onclicktestgtTEST BUTTON ltdivgt   codepre  pand have a JS function called codetestcodep  precodefunction test     var url  index.phpmodulegetlist     Code to send post request with a callback to function test2  codepre  pand a function test2p  precodefunction test2data     if data         alertdata.Project[0].id          else          alertERROR       codepre  pNote The PHP code returns a JSON object and one of the subobject thingies is called Project which is an associate array with fields like id and name. p  pThe above works. The alert box shows a number that corresponds to a project id.p  pBut, we want to have a popup that contains the list So, we get some html like thisp  precodelttd aligncenter onclickcollectionRandomName, RandomDescriptiongtProject 1lttdgt codepre  pNote I am passing the values for the item Name and Description to a JS function called collection.p  precodefunction collectionname, description     test     Stuff that creates the popup, creates a form in the popup, and populates the form  with default valuesname and description.      Following Stuff is used to make the drop down.     var tempdata  new Arraynew Array     tempdata[0][name]  json.Project[0].name     tempdata[0][value]  json.Project[0].id     This function creates the Select list, it requires a name, default value, and     a multidimensional array like the one defined above.     var pacolist  createSelectcollectionlist,,tempdata       Append the elements together and add a save button.  codepre  pTo try and get this to work, I declared a global variable called json at the top of the page. I changed the codealertdata.Project[0].idcode in test2 to codejson  datacode But, it didnt work. p  pI get an codeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property Project of undefinedcode error when I click to open the popup. p  pI changed the test2 method to be like this insteadp  precodefunction test2data       ifdata           return data              else           Code from the original test function to send post request to PHP with           a callback to test2.        codepre  pand in the codecollectioncode function, I added this codevar json  test2code,No global json but that did not work either.p  pSorry for the long winded question, but basically, I open a function, the function needs to call another function that sends a post request and the data received by the request needs to be used by the original function. How do I do this p  pI think this is just a time issue. As in the request takes a while, and in the mean time, the original function has already moved on.p  pEDIT Found a solution. I think it was a timing issue. In order to fix it. I made the page html call a function that stored the name and description as global variables. This function then made the post request with a callback to a different function. This different function then used the data the JSON object it received and passed it along with the global name and description to the codecollectioncode function mentioned earlier. p

I should a hrefhttpwww.jguru.comfaqview.jspEID740 relnofollowusea request chaining.

Whether servletA should now it should redirect to servletB, or some, dont know supervising object should do the job.li liIf we are storing everything in request attributes, as Strings, in case we need to parametrize servletB call regarding to data weve get in servletA, we have to provide some tedious serializingdeserializing work.  li ul  pSo, my question is  strongwhat is the best approach to add data to JSP page from several different sourcesstrong.      p  pExcuse me if these questions sound stupid to seasoned JSP developer, the fact is java world is really, really huge and mature, so it is not always easy to find out the truth.  p

Negative 5909 pI need to get the frontmost address of a complete object even if what I have happens to be a subobject.p  pThe current version of my experimental smart pointer can only compare locations of a complete object and one of its subobjects. It is simply storing their addresses and their sizes in bytes and see if they overlap. The problem lies in comparing two subobjects of a complete object in the case of multiple inheritance. Since these subobjects will not overlap each other they wont be recognized as belonging to the same object. This would require the offset to the head of the complete object from the subobject to gain the address of the complete object for comparison.p  pNote that this comparison has nothing to do with accessing or destructing the objects. Its only to map handles to an object, no matter what the sub type of the handle is. The handle itself is responsible for holding the type and disposing of it once no more references to the same object exist.p  pIs it possible to hijack the vtable in order to get the offset to the complete object Ive been unable to find a standard function that allows you to do this. My assumption is that abusing the vtable is highly implementation dependent and will most likely not be reusable on another compiler. Using typeid on an object manages to work out what the complete object is given a subobject, so I believe its possible to achieve.

Negative 5909 pI need a way to know when an event loop has started and when it is about to exit. I am trying to synchronize between threads and there is hard to resolve race condition involving codeisRunningcode at the times when the loop starts and when it exits.p  pI believe for starting I can simply post an event since it will be queued and dispatched once it starts. But for exiting Im not sure how to handle it. I need some kind of event that will happen just prior to the loop completing.p  pIs there any way to accomplish thisp  hr  pThe reason I need this is for posting events to the thread. I have a function, a cleanup function in particular, say codecleanupObjectcode. This function can be called from any thread and is expected to do cleanup on the object. These objects are owned by a thread with an event loop. If this event loop is running this codecleanupObjectcode request has to be processed as an event in that event loop. If the event loop is not running then the cleanup has to be handled differently this happens during shutdown.p  pThe race exists because codeisRunningcode has no synchronization I can use, so while it said true when I called it, it may not longer be running the instant after. I need to know whethere the event I post to the loop will be processed or not, because if it will not be processed I must do cleanup in a different fashion.p

I noticed that if my fling from right to left is short but of course bigger than the SWIPEMINDISTANCE it always work, but for example if my flings size is almost 34 screen it sometimes behaves incorrect. Another interesting thing, it always works on emulator, the problem is detected on phone. Any one had this problem p

Negative 5909 p Hi Folks,BR First of all sorry, this is going to be a moderately long post.So, please have the patience to read it through. p  p Here, I am going to put down some concepts which I have learned while skimming through some articles on lockfree programming and present my doubts on that learning.BR Also, the discussion is on NIX multiprocessor platform. p  p Starting by saying that LOCKLESS  BLOCKLESS as it is said that the system of threads as a whole makes progress because a CASDCAS can only fail if some thread has made progress.BR So, we can say that, here in case of blocking on a mutex, we are spinningwaiting on a condition The CAS while loop for eg.. BR BR pre Quest1  How would spinning on a while loop be more efficient than blocking on aBR mutex BR Quest2  A good design employing mutexes also ensure that system progresses, soBR isnt that BLOCKLESS too by definition pre p  p As an answer to Question 1, one would argue that the blocking may go into kernel wait and there may be context switches which may be costly. Any further clarity on it would be appreciated. p  p Okay, assuming that after getting the answer for first 2 question I will be convinced to think that lockfree is really fast and real time when the atomic operations to be done bare not bigtime consumingb.BR pre Quest3  So, isnt lockfree something like spinlock  If yes, why cant we use BRpthread spin lock  pre p  p Going ahead, in most of the literature available on net, one would see an implementation of atomic operation like thisBR pre asm volatilelocknxadd X  0,1                                                                           rresult,mT ipAddress                                                                        0iaddValue                                                                                          memory   What does this mean  Memory Fencing  pre pre Quest4  Does memory in the above assemble mean memory fencing  If yes, BRdoesnt that take around 100 cycles to implement  BR Quest5  Doesnt the lock instruction here assert that the operation is beingBR done on a shared resource, thus other threads are blocking here  BRAs far as I know BR this question is not valid for the more or less recent Intel multi proc archBR as the locking is done on cache lines. pre p  p Thanks in advance. p

Negative 5909 pI have a locally packaged plugin that isnt available from any update server I built and exported it from source code, using Eclipse.

Negative 5909 pI am a selfthought newbie programmer and I am working on my first web application  a website on which users can register, log in, and then post things into a database or search the database.p  pI am currently at about 150 files, and have learned a lot in the process. My coding skills have gone though the roof compared to what they were before.p  pNow I am at a point where I am a little stuck. I know there are still many security issues with my site I know what to do to fix them, also I realized that I used a depreciated function the old PHP mySQL API and I have just discovered a much better way to handle post data. Also I noticed, that my website is starting to get kind of slow, and I think there are a couple of places where I could condense my code. p  pI have tried to keep my code neat, organized and well structured. However, some files have gotten a little out of hand as I added to them. One of my worst files is 550 lines long, other files I am having trouble figuring out what exactly I was doing...p  pI am torn back and forth between the idea of rewriting everything from scratch and trying to fix those issues, which I know about.p  pI feel like I might be able to do a much better job, doing it all over from the beginning after all I have gained so much experience since I started. At the other hand I am sure itll take FOREVER, even though I might be able to just copy and paste a few sections.p  pLike I said, there are many new features and techniques I have learned, which I could now implement, to improve the site  but I am also afraid that a couple months down the road I might have issues like that coming up again, and find myself in the same position of debating whether or not to rewrite the code.p  pSo my question to the experienced programmers is  Would it be a good idea for a newbie to rewrite the code from scratch  Or will every programmer find themselves in this position after a while of programming, that everything seems like it might need a makeoverp  pI did read this article a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1064403whentorewriteacodebasefromscratchWhen to rewrite a code base from scratcha but I feel like my question comes from a different perspective.

Negative 5909 pI have a situation where I need to return a single collection of objects from mongo, but need to use two queries to get the results. The order of these results is important because they are paginated.p  pHeres the first query listings based on a category and a price rangep  precodemylistings  MoListing.wherecriteriaa codepre  pThe second query needs to use the results of the first query as a filter. So something like p  precodeeverythingelse  MoListing.wherecriteriab codepre  pThen union the resultsp  precodemylistings ltlt everythingelse codepre  pAnd finally, return paginated resultsp  precodemylistings.page1.per25 codepre  pIt seems that part of my issue is that mongo queries are not executed until they are needed. Is there a way for me to trigger the execution of a query at a given point Or is there another approach I should take in building this result setp  pstrongUpdate with more infostrongp  pThe behavior Im seeing is that what gets returned is just the results in codelistingscode. I have also confirmed that codeeverythingelsecode does contain the expected records 48 records in mylistings, 52 in everythingelse as expected.p  pWhen applying code.allcode to my queries as mentioned in the comments, no impact is made. A codeputs listings.inspectcode results inp  precode105700 web.1       ltMongoidCriteria 105700 web.1     selector pricegtgtegt25, ltegt75, 105700 web.1     options  , 105700 web.1     class    MoListing, 105700 web.1     embedded falsegt codepre  pHowever, codelistings.countcode does result in code48code. Am I just missing some stupid simple way of merging these results And once I do have the results in one collection, how will this impact the pagination functions that follow. Im using codekaminaricode for pagination.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pPer an answer below and my own trial and error, Ive found toa to be a solution, but not an ideal one. This does functionp  precodemerge the results together as an Array results  listings.toa  everythingelse.toa codepre  pThis causes the pagination via Kaminari to have to change as we are no longer working with mongo criteria, but instead, a standard Array. Heres the new pagination methodp  precodeKaminari.paginatearrayresults.pagepage.perperpage codepre  pWorking with a small dataset of 100 records, this is fine and dandy  54msp  precodedebugsuccesstrue,prerenderduration54.808775999999995,overallduration86.36554100000001,count25,paginationtotalpages4,currentpage1 codepre  pHowever, using a larger dataset Im seeing significantly slower times when using the .toa method to combine these. Although the examples are not exactly apples to apples, this large of a difference points to the issue being with toa returning everything, forcing Kaminari to work with a lot more actual datap  pMy results without toa, simply returning all records with criteria applied  15msp  precodedebugsuccesstrue,prerenderduration15.107164,overallduration18.267599,count25,paginationtotalpages81,currentpage1 codepre  pMy results with toa, merging two resultsets  415msp  precodedebugsuccesstrue,prerenderduration415.258199,overallduration450.66537800000003,count25,paginationtotalpages81,currentpage1 codepre  pTo summarize, this is not a valid option. Returning each dataset individually takes lt15ms even with a large dataset, so I think what I need to accomplish is a way to merge the criteria together so that a single query is run against Mongo, allowing pagination to happen on the db, where it should be.p  pIn SQL I would do something roughly likep  precodeselect    from   listings where   field  blah union all select    from   listings where   field ltgt blah codepre  pIs it possible to do this in Mongop

Negative 5909 pI have a class with a a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevrefmodelsfieldsimagefield relnofollowDjango ImageFielda and I have been struggling to decide between two alternatives for storing that fields codeuploadtocode function.

Negative 5909 pWe are creating a REST service that will return a stream of an image in a given dimension. We are requesting the image name and the final type and max dimension.

Negative 5909 pI have a relatively simple question and I hope to get an answer on it.p  pImagine I have a static library in iOS say MyLibrary.ap  pIn this library say there is some .m file which calls codeimport SomeHeaderWhichDoesNotYetExist.hcode  however the thing is that, when the codeimport SomeHeaderWhichDoesNotYetExist.hcode is called, the SomeHeaderWhichDoesNotYetExist.h may not necessarily exist in the project as suggested also by its title. e.g.,p  precodeifdef something import SomeHeaderWhichDoesNotYetExist.h endif codepre  pWhen someone strongusesstrong the Mylibrary.a  heshe may then, stronglaterstrong implement the SomeHeaderWhichDoesNotYetExist.h, and we want the MyLibrary.a to be able to automatically use it as specified in the code above.

Negative 5909 pI got stuck trying to answer this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13806958explainingoddbehaviorinjavascriptExplaining odd behavior in javascripta. While researching, I found that event handlers assigned directly to host objects present a strange behavior they can be accessed as properties of the object, but somehow they dont appear to be actual properties.p  pFor example, if I define a variable on the global scope, it looks like any other property of codewindowcodep  precodevar foo  foo console.logObject.getOwnPropertyDescriptorwindow, foo  Object value foo, writable true, enumerable true, configurable false  codepre  pI get the same output if I just assign to codewindow.foocode, or if I create an implied global but then [[Configurable]] would be codetruecode, for known reasons and, of course, that wouldnt work on strict mode. However, if I try to add an event handler by assigning to codewindow.onsomethingcode, I cant read that property with codeObject.getOwnPropertyDescriptorcode although its still accessible under codewindow.onsomethingcodep  precodewindow.onresize  function onresizee      console.logrsz, e  console.logwindow.onresize  function onresize... console.logObject.getOwnPropertyDescriptorwindow, onresize  undefined codepre  pHow do browsers deal with event handlers assigned like that I suspect the answer to this is also the answer to that other question.p

However, at some point while I was working on it, it changed from capturing 5megapixel 43 images to capturing 1920x1080 169 images. I cant find anywhere that the aspect ratio is specified, and I didnt change any of the code relating to the configuration of the camera, capture sessions, or capture connection. Why did my camera start taking 169 photosp  pstrongUpdatestrong I just reran Apples original sample code, and it appears that it is also saving 169 images captured directly from the video. It is quite possible that I was insane before, or I took a test shot with Camera.app and was looking at that. So my real question is, how do I show a live feed from the camera on the screen while Im shooting, and take a fullresolution photo. I cant use codeUIImagePickerControllercode, because I need to be able to overlay things on top of the live camera feed.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I was able to solve this by throwing out the AVCapture code I was using. It turns out that UIImagePickerController does what I needed. I didnt realize you could overlay custom controls  I thought it took over the whole screen until you were done taking a picture.p
Negative 5909 pI need to develop an iterator over a filesystem subtree in Java. The state of the filesystem might change while the iteration is still in progress e.g. new folders and files get created and deleted. The iterator should therefore first capture a snapshot of the hierarchy e.g. crawl the tree and save the names of all files found to a list and then iterate over the snapshot.p  pstrongI am wondering if it is a good idea or not to put the code to create the cache into the iterators constructor.strong An alternative would be to designate a speciall method for that named codeinitcode.p  pThe size and depth of the iterated subtree might get quite large and the caching will therefore be time consuming. Moreover, it might throw IOExceptions I am still not sure if it is good design practice to throw exceptions from constructors in Java.p  pOn the other hand, creating a dedicated method to initialize the iterator would mean the client code could not use the iterator as simply an implementation of the Iterator interface.p  pThe client code would also be responsible for calling the init method prior to the traversal. I could have the codehasNextcodecodenextcode methods first make sure that the iterator has been initialized and if not, call the codeinitcode method from within them. But that would mean the first call to these methods would be significantly slower than the next ones without any reasons visible from the client side.p

Negative 5909 pIm trying to work out a way of doing pseudo 3d, distorting textures with the javascript canvas.p  pThe best method for my needs so far has been to use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDisplacementmapping relnofollowdisplacement mapsa which Im largely following from a hrefhttpwww.soundstep.comblog20120425javascriptdisplacementmapping relnofollowthis tutorial and source code examplea.p  pThe basic principle is to use the channel level RGBA from a selected pixel in the displacement map then applying a pixel shifting algorithm... all good so far.p  pThe problem is that this method of shifting the texture images pixels is very binary and renders a slightly jagged edge due to the fact that  its simply shifting full pixels.p  pWhen compared to PhotoShop or some of the a hrefhttpwww.imagemagick.orgUsagemappingdisplacementmaps relnofollowImageMagick examples herea the javascript method looks much less realistic.

Negative 5909 pI have the stored procedure below that I need help on.  Its purpose is to find differences between a staging DB and the production DB.  When it finds the difference, the stored procedure will update the production DB with the correct information.  The problem is that sometimes there is more than one difference between the DBs.  The stored procedure can only handle one difference between the DBs at a time.  I want the stored procedure to be able to handle as many differences as it finds.  If it can only handle one difference at a time, the stored procedure would need to be running continually.

Negative 5909 pI recently resurrected an old project which uses CUDAOpenGL interop.  When I was originally working with it, Im not sure if I ever ran a Debug configuration I probably only ran in Release.p  pThis time around I attempted to run in Debug, only to have the program appear to hang.  First, I narrowed down the hang to the first codecudaMalloccode call.  So I set up a much simpler test project with one codecudaMalloccode call using some fake data.  Running this in Debug worked like a charm.p  pFrom there, I decided to figure out at what point in the initialization of my program codecudaMalloccode would fail.  Slowly moving a test allocation deeper into the program revealed that the hang would occur if the allocation was placed after GLUTs window creation, codeglutCreateWindowcode.  However, a little further investigation revealed that the program wasnt really hanging the malloc was just taking an unusually long time.  In Release, its a noticable hitch, something like one second as opposed to instantaneous if occurring before the codeglutCreateWindowcode call.  In Debug, the allocation is also instantaneous before the window creation, but takes longer than one minute after.p  pI decided to confirm this pattern in my simple test project, but things just got stranger.  Initializing a GLUT window in my test project emdidntem affect the performance of codecudaMalloccode.  What emdidem end up dropping the performance was pulling the code.cucode files from my original project into my test project.  Note one of these code.cucode files is around 1500 lines not sure if this comes into play.p  pSo, to recap, the conditions under which I see a severe drop in performance of codecudaMalloccode arep  ol liIt comes after a codeglutCreateWindowcode call.li liIt occurs in a project with other, potentially large, code.cucode files being compiled.li ol  pIve narrowed this down about as far as I think I can, but dont really know what to do from here.  Why might this be happening  Perhaps this would not be a problem if I was using something other than GLUTp  pIm running on 64bit Windows 7 using CUDA version 4.1.p  pUpdate I made some quick edits to use GLFW instead of GLUT, and am seeing the same pattern.  Prior to window creation  fast allocation, afterwards  slow.p

Negative 5909 pThis is a simple game I am attempting to write, its not however, turning out to be as efficient as expected... Heres my objective.  The array is not working correctly and the overall logic is incomplete.  The objective is if the sum of the dice on that first roll was 2, 3, or 12, you told the player that heshe lost if the sum was 7 or 11, you told the player heshe had won if the first roll was any other number 4,5,6,8,9,10, the player was told that heshe must roll again. Now extend that program as follows  if the player was told to roll again after the first roll if it was a 4,5,6,8,9,10, save that number, call it the point. Now continue rolling until one of two things happen  if the player rolls a 7 before rolling the point number again, the player loses and the turn is over if the player matches the point before a 7 is rolled the player wins and the turn is over. If any number besides a 7 or the point is rolled nothing happens and the player just keeps rolling. Tell the player if they won or lost, the results of each roll, and how many rolls it took to get the result.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZzH6d.png altenter image description herep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltctimegt  using namespace std  int main      int die1,          die2,          sum,          point,         rollChoice     static int rollCount      int rolls  new int[]      rollCount1     point0      srandtime0      coutltltEnter 1 to roll      cingtgtrollChoice      ifrollChoice1               for int i0 iltINTMAX i                      die1rand10             die2rand10              sumdie1die2              rolls[sum]              ifrolls[i]  2  rolls[i]  3  rolls[i]  12                              coutltltnYou have lostltltendl                  rollCount                  coutltltn                 cingtgtrollChoice                           else ifrolls[i]  7  rolls[i]  11                              coutltltnYou have wonltltendl                  rollCount                  coutltltn                 cingtgtrollChoice                          else ifrolls[i]  4  rolls[i]  5  rolls[i]  6  rolls[i]  8  rolls[i]  9  rolls[i]  10                              coutltltnYou have lost, roll again.                  pointrolls[i]                  coutltltn                 cingtgtrollChoice                  rollCount                  ifrollCount7                                      forint i0 ilt7 i                                              coutltltnRoll ltltiltlt. ltltrolls[i]                                                                       cin.get     cin.get      return 0  codepre  pp
Negative 5909 pThe issue of iOS not persisting localStorageWebSQL databases has been discussed frequently here and on other sites. The problem I am having is that the workarounds are so varied and have evolved over time. I have found 2 different PhoneGap plugins which use the native SQLite API, a plugin that periodically copies the SQL database to the documents directory,and even suggested settings in a  Xcode .plist file that can be used to specify the location of SQL database. Its confusing because Im not sure which solution applies best to the current point in time iOS 6 and Cordova 2.4. Is this built in to Cordova now or do I still need a plugin. If so, which plugin What about the setting the database location in an Xcode config file.  Any help is deeply appreciatedp

Negative 5909 pIm implementing a special case of an immutable dictionary, which for convenience implements codeIEnumerableltKeyValuePairltFoo, Bargtgtcode. Operations that would ordinarily modify the dictionary should instead return a new instance.p  pSo far so good. But when I try to write a fluentstyle unit test for the class, I find that neither of the two fluent assertion libraries Ive tried a hrefhttpsgithub.comerichexterShouldShoulda and a hrefhttpfluentassertions.codeplex.comFluent Assertionsa supports the codeNotBeSameAscode operation on objects that implement codeIEnumerablecode  not unless you first cast them to codeObjectcode.p  pWhen I first ran into this, with Should, I assumed that it was just a hole in the framework, but when I saw that Fluent Assertions had the same hole, it made my think that since Im a relative newcomer to C I might be missing something conceptual about C collections  the author of Should a hrefhttpsgithub.comerichexterShouldissues1implied as mucha when I filed an issue.p  pObviously there are other ways to test this  cast to codeObjectcode and use codeNotBeSameAscode, just use codeObject.ReferenceEqualscode, whatever  but if theres a good reason not to, Id like to know what that is.p
Negative 5909 pI have two content types in a Drupal 7.20 environment which embed views or blocks.  When I allow those content types in search results, the results page goes sideways whenever those content types are represented in the result set the pager shows a different number of total pages from one results page to the next, or disappears entirely after I hit Next , fewer than 10 results show per page yet theres a pager..., etc., etc.p  pIf I disallow those content types via Custom Search, I dont see any problems with pagination, etc.p  pWhat I have noticed is that the actual viewsblocks get executed when the search results page is constructed  its not merely a matter of hits being found in the searchindex table.p  pAnybody know how to address this problemp  pIve searched through stackoverflow, and issues for Search and Custom Search on Drupal.org  no joy.p  pThanks in advance,  Leep  p[Edit fixed a couple of typos...] [31713 Edit The problem turns out to be due to the pager for the view or block that is included in the search result set.  If the view is in the result set, but doesnt have a pager, there is no problem.  My solution, therefore, is to detect that Im on a search results page in hookviewsqueryalter by looking at the request URI and setp  precodeviewgtitemsperpage  0  codepre  pwhich effectively gets rid of the views pager.p

Negative 5909 pHeres the scenario  I have multiple developers on an asp.net mvc 4 project.  Each developer has a local database.  The source control system is TFS at a hrefhttptfs.visualstudio.com relnofollowhttptfs.visualstudio.coma.  Were using Azure websites to host the site.  We have also configured Azure websites for continuous deployment.p  pThe source control system could be git, mercurial, TFS, etc.  Honestly, I dont think it matters. p  pMy question is how to accomplish these three thingsp  ol liEach developer has hisher own connection strings locally without them being in source controlli liAzure has its own connection strings without it being in source controlli liSource Control doesnt show any connection informationli liThe ability for each developer to F5 and rundebugtest the app locally.li ol  pWe accomplished 1 by adding our individual connection strings to our machine.config so that theres no conflict between developer workstation setups.p  pI originally removed the connectionstrings section from web.config.  In the Azure website using the management portal, under Configure, I configured the connection strings, and after watching a Scott Hanselman video was under the impression that these would be dynamagically merged into my web.config upon deployment, but that doesnt appear to happen.  Whenever I go to any page that hits the db, I get an error saying cant find the connection string or some other db error related to the connectionp  pIf I put the Azure connection string directly in web.config,  Things work on Azure, but then the connection details are in source control visible to everybody.  p  pAfter reading some more posts from Scott and David Ebbo it seems that I could put a blank connection string in web.config with the correct name and then Azure will overwrite the values correctly.  I would then have to have the developers put their connection strings in their web.debug.config and then install the Slow Cheetah plugin so that they could F5 and test locally.  They would also have to not check in the web.debug.config into source control.  Not that easy with TFS  This seems like a seriously burdensome kludge, thats bound to fail somewhere along the line.p  pI have to believe that this isnt that rare of a problem.  How do other teams accomplish thisp

Negative 5909 pI am relatively new to CSS and yet I seem to have got the language reasonably well for a newbie. However, whilst many of the tutorials I have read often warn about organising and structuring your stylesheet properly and I can certainly see why now I have created some rather long stylesheets myself I cant for the life of me find any info about a standardised format for a styleheet or a logical pattern for layout that makes later human reading easy.p  pFor example, do I create a commentbracketed section for each geographical section of my page header, row1, row2, article1 etc and keep all styles for that section within those comment borders The problem seems when I have styles that get reused in other sections  and putting them under a section for pagewide styles then negates the purpose of grouping them by section at all. Likewise, structuring my stylesheet by grouping based on text styles, layout styles etc seems even more confusing.p  pIs there a good practice I know this sounds dumb but it seems no matter what you do with HTML and CSS somebody is ready to tell you its wrong, bad practice or unsemantic and Im left confused. I want my code to be a good example of my work in case an employer wants to check it in future.p

Negative 5909 pIm putting together a WinForms utility in c which allows admins to query and perform actions in bulk on computers within my work environment. Ive started to create a few mock projects to present to my superiors. p  pThe utility displays ap  ol lilist of computers in a datagridview name, uptime, operating system, location, etcli lilist of actionsqueries that can be performed on selected computersli ol  pThe actions and queries will need to update rows in the Computer datagridview with their results. The user needs to be able to sort the columns in the datagridview and filter the rows based on computer locations.p  pMy Computers datagridview is populated as follows Datagridview  BindingSource  DataSet  Local Databasep  pWhen the Util is first run, the list of computers is read from an Active Directory group and inserted in to the Local Database. The computers DataTable is then populated based on a query from the Database. The BindingSource is then bound to the DataTable and the datagridview is bound to the BindingSource to display to the user.p  pWhen an Action is run on a selection of computers, the results are added to the Computers Datatable which is reflected in the Datagridview and also commited to the SQLCEDatabase.p  pWhen a user selects a different location from a list of locations a SQL query is run to repopulate the datatable with the results from the local database.p  pThe Util has no requirement to save any of the data that is collected, in fact, when the Util is first run it deletes all records from the local database and starts fresh.p  pI think I may have gone overkill with my design and would appreciate some advice on better a way to put it all together. Would I be better off scrapping the Local Database and keeping all the data in memory via a BindingList or other type of list Would this still allow me to filter the datagridview based on queries and allow sortingp  pApologies if this post is long and convoluted, but I dont know how to put it any other way.p
Negative 5909 pIm trying to find a similar approach to Qunits assertions in Python.

These are only shown when an assertion fails.p  precodeclass TestSequenceFunctionsunittest.TestCase     def testchoiceself         seq  range10         element  random.choiceseq         self.assertTrueelement in seq, msgElement not found in sequence codepre  pThe end result of the Qunit is that there is much clearer transcript which could be compared against a spec document.p  pI realise that in Python, a similar approach would be achieved by perhaps say writingp  precodedef testchoiceensureelementexistsinsequenceself codepre  pIts not the same though. The output isnt presented in a nice way, and test lifecycle then performs setup and teardown for each label you want to use, which isnt necessarily what you want.p  pThere might be a library out there which takes this approach, so perhaps this issue is already solved. Neither the python unittest library or pytest appear to work in this fashion though.p

On any other machine, the application crashes immediately upon start.p  pIve positively ruled out any issues regarding .NET installation in the client machine by packing the application in an installer which installs the proper version of .NET if need be.p  pAs of now, my thoughts are that I am handling packing my two COM references incorrectly or that the application is dying from a security exception.p  pThe application utilizes the COM Excel reference as well as one other COM reference that any client running my app will have installed on their machine. I have attempted to both distribute the application relying on Visual Studio to work magic and pull needed references, and also to force the references to CopyLocal. Isolating the references failed, but Im not sure if that is necessary or not.p  pDoes anyone have any clues as to what the issue could be Dont hesitate to ask me for clarification on anything.p

So something like thisp  precodeapp.config[provide, functionprovide    provide.decoratorngClickDirective, [delegate, functiondelegate       Trigger Google Analytics tracking here     return delegate   ] ] codepre  pBut this wont work as decorators are fired on instantiation, not when the expression in the directive is met.

Negative 5909 pIve just started studying Spring, and Im trying to make a web application. I have some common UI elements such as footer, header, sidebar and also want to add dynamic blocks, i.e. widgets. What widgets to include need to be chosen in Java code, not JSP template.p  pAnd thats where Im stuck. Every controller returns its own view  codemain.jspcode which includes some static and dynamic blocksp  precode ltjspinclude pagehead.jsp gt        ltcforEach itemsviewList varviewNamegt                  ltjspinclude pageviewName.jsp gt         ltcforEachgt ... codepre  pIn controler Im passing view list and object that will be used as widget to modelp  precode ...  views.addmoduleOne.getViewName  views.addmoduleTwo.getViewName  model.addAllAttributesmoduleOne.getAttr    model.addAllAttributesmoduleTwo.getAttr    model.addAttributeIModule.VIEWLIST, views  passing all views that will be included into main.jsp  ...  return main codepre  pBut it doesnt work because when I use codejspinclude pagecode model parameters do not pass to includee. Also I cant codeinclude filecode because in that case I wont be able to use variables and I would need to know which view to pass at compile time.p  pOf course if theres no solution, Ill have to hardcode all possible widget views in codemain.jspcode and switch between themp  precode   switchi      case 1            include filewidget1.jsp           break     case 2          include filewidget2.jsp         break       ...                          codepre  pWhich is obviously not flexible.p  pSo, the questions arep  ol liIs there any way to solve the problem of passing model to include views without using  codeinclude filecode and make my widgets working li liIs there some better way to implement such widgets structureli ol  pThank you p

Negative 5909 pI recently switched to using Android ndkr9 and am having some difficulty with my app that seems to be related to compiler optimization.

When I do this, count is 1 and my app works correctly.  However if I comment out the GDebugLog line and make NO other changes, when I run my app, it no longer works.  In the function GTouchEventsGetCount, I also am logging what it is returning and the value is always correctly 1.  Also, I log the return from the call to the function above i.e. GetTouchPos.  When the GDebugLog line is present, the logged return value is the correct value 1.  However when I comment out the GDebugLog call, the logged return value is a seemingly random number, which looks suspiciously like an uninitialized variable. p  pNote that this all works with our without the GDebugLog line when I was using r8b.  Also note that if I turn optimization off, this code works perfectly using r9 whether the debugging line is present or not.  Also note that this behavior only presents itself when compiling for the ARM processor.  The version I build for x86 works without problem.p  pAm I doing something questionable here that is causing the optimizer to generate incorrect codep  pCan anyone shed some light on what might be happening p  pThanks.p

Negative 5909 pI am recently doing some studies on numerical algorithms in C. Therefore I did some experiments in search for the most suitable math library for .NET. One thing I do very often is to evaluate objective functions, which usually are functions that take a vector as input and returns a vector as output. I compared the implementations of the same objective function in ILNumerics, system array and Math.NET. The syntax of ILNumerics really makes it stand out because it resembles that of MatLab and R for lengthy mathematical formulas. However, I discovered that for the same number of evaluations, ILNumerics seems to be taking much longer than either system array of Math.NET. Below is the code I used to compare.

Negative 5909 pIm implementing my own java treeset. I think the underlying data structure is a BST and each node in the tree contains Object type data field. However, I stuck at how to compare two Object type data using natural ordering comparator. Is there a compareTo function that compares two objects and return the value of their natural ordering Im also thinking using hashcode as index key for each node and do comparison based on that. But it seems that distinct object might have same hashcode. Any advice is appreciated.p

Negative 5909 pI am trying to calculate a fairly complicated function, say func  involving several additions, substractions, multiplications, divisions and trigonometric functions, of several twodimensional arrays in fortran. The calculation is massively parrallel, in that each func is independent over its row and column location. Each of the matrices is many gigabytes in size, and there are about a dozen of them as arguments.p  pI would like to make use of Intel MKL functions invoking mklparallel, in particular VML functions to add, subtract, divide etc. My question is how can I render a complicated functional expression such as, p  pe.g. funcx,y,z  xycoszxx where x,y,z are 2d arrays of several GBp  pin terms of VML functions but using more familiar binary operators. You see my problem requires, in principle, converting all the binary operators, such as  and  into binary functions taking arguments as vaddx,y. Of course this would be very cumbersome and unsightly for large expressions. Is there a way to overload the binary arithmetic operators such as , to preferentially use MKLVML versions in fortran. An example would be nice Thanksp

Negative 5909 pIm trying to design a simple and reliable masterslaves protocol for a 2wires RS485 bus.p  pAll the nodes on the bus have a unique address. One node is the master that is the only node that is able to start communications. All other nodes cant send anything until the master sends a request to them.p  pI was thinking on simple requestresponse protocol the master sends a request to a slave and wait for its answer. After that, M sends a request to another slave. Three scenarios could happen.p  ol liBoth frames request and response are correctly received by the destination and the transaction ends with no problem.li liThe request from the master isnt received by the slave checksum error. After a timeout, the master sends again the request. No problem.li liThe response from the slave isnt received by the master checksum error. After a timeout, the master could send again the request.li ol  pIMHO, the last scenario is problematic.  The slave isnt able to understand if the second request is exactly the same of the first, so it processes the request two times. What happens if the request is move the motor two steps, give me if a switch is pressend since last request, toggle a relay, and so onp  pI think the simplest requestresponse protocol cant work well, except if the application level knows the limitations of the protocol and avoids requests that are dangerous if transmitted two times.p  pHave you some good simple and reliable protocol to suggest I dont want to reinvent the wheel.p

Negative 5909 pFirst off, I am new at testing, so this may be a dumb question.  I am currently creating unit tests for my classes.  I have one property that depending on a nullable property will send off a new Comment object to the database. Usually with unit testing I would just make sure an object got sent to my Mock Service, and call it good.  However, would it not make more sense to test the values on the Comment Object to make sure it is going down the correct path, instead of just assuming it did. Here is a sample of the code I am testingp  precodeif DeliveryDate  null     AddPartHistoryDelivery Date Changed from   DateTimeDeliveryDate.ToShortDateString   to   DateTimevalue.ToShortDateString  else     AddPartHistoryDelivered Date of   DateTimevalue.ToShortDateString   was added.  codepre  pThe codeAddPartHistorycode function sends the Comment object which holds the text in a Property called Entry to the database or to a Mock Service during test, and stores it in a Property called codeNewPartHistorycode.  And here is the code that I believe may be more of an integration testp  precodevm.DeliveryDate  DateTime.UtcNow Assert.AreEqualDelivered Date of   DateTimevm.DeliveryDate.ToShortDateString   was added., vm.NewPartHistory.Entry  OldDeliveryDate  vm.DeliveryDate vm.DeliveryDate  DateTime.UtcNow Assert.AreEqualDelivery Date Changed from   DateTimeOldDeliveryDate.ToShortDateString   to   DateTimevm.DeliveryDate.ToShortDateString, vm.NewPartHistory.Entry codepre  pSo, back to the question, should I leave this code in the unit test, or move to integration test.p  h1Updateh1  pSince there was a lot of talk about my codeAddPartHistorycode Method, here it is. It simply fills out the standard data for a codePartHistorycode which is always the same, adds the Entry, and then updates a codeListviewcode with new datap  precodeprivate void AddPartHistorystring historyText     NewPartHistory  new CdaService.PartHistory    NewPartHistory.EnteredBy  User.Current.UID    NewPartHistory.Entry  historyText    NewPartHistory.EntryDate  DateTime.UtcNow    NewPartHistory.PartId  ThisPart.Id    webService.InsertNewPartHistory    GetPartHistory  codepre

Negative 5909 pWhen I run my app in the simulator at some point the UI becomes completely unresponsive table view doesnt scroll, buttons dont react, etc.p  pI know that in general this is the result of locking up the main thread which is responsible for handling the UI but all heavy load is happening asynchronously as far as I can tell.p  pIve looked at the CPU meter and all threads seem to be at 0. Oddly enough, if I try to profile using instruments then the UI doesnt get locked up. I also didnt notice anything odd in instruments, CPU usage seems to be normallow and the time profiler doesnt seem to show any odd behavior.p  pstrongMy general question isstrong What are some other reasons why the UI would become unresponsive even if the CPU load is 0 What are the best ways to debug this kind of thingp  pstrongMore specificallystrong The details of the app are probably too complex for this particular question, but just for some contextp  ul liIm using AFIncrementalStore  CoreDatali liThe UI unresponsiveness only happens when I try to fetch multiple relationships via the   incremental store delegate.li liDuring this time there doesnt seem to be any network activity that I can tell. I can monitor logs on my server and nothing seems to be hitting it during that time.li liAs mentioned above, when running with instrumentsprofiling the UI doesnt lock up.li liIm testing this with a single view controller using a fetched results controller to pull the data.li ul  pMy best guess is that theres a deadlock happening somewhere on the main thread, which is why the CPU load reports 0 but still the UI is unresponsive. I have no idea how to debug this however. This could either be something deep in CoreData land or could be something in one of the 3rd party AFclasses. Ive sprinkled breakpoints all over the place and none of them get hit.p  pIve been scratching my head for a few hours now. Without getting into details about my particular apps implementation, I was hoping to get some general debugging tips for this sort of problem.

Negative 5909 pIm using an own framework for generate inputs, validate them and run a set of solutions over them to check if they are all the same. You can check that framework on a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgdanielmaxxjudgetools relnofollowhttpsbitbucket.orgdanielmaxxjudgetoolsa.p  pBy now it works OK, but Im looking for a better way to define validators rather than using complex regular expressions. Im thinking on using some sort of language for input specification, easier to write and much more legible. For those who dont know ACMICPC input standar, its something likep  precode2 3 8 3 abc def ghi 4 8 44 6 6 2 45 96 20 21 4 64 14 6 66 78 12 codepre  pWhere that could be interpreted as There will be a line with an integer N indicating the number of players. Next line will contain N integers indicating players ages. Next line will contain an integer M indicating the possible names to pick, then, next line will contain M alphanumeric strings separated by spaces. Finally, a line with an integer K will indicate the relation matrix. Following K lines will contain K integers of the matrixs aij element.p  pSince reading that input can be programmed, I wonder if there is some library or utility preferably in Python to create data validators from descriptions of the input data in a non programmatic way.p  pAny suggestion will be welcome  p

Negative 5909 pIm using .net HttpClient but this may be a more general question about HTTP I want to allow users to upload large files, from sometimes slow and unreliable mobile connections. If the upload doesnt start within, say, 20 seconds, theres probably a connection problem, so the app should take appropriate action eg give up for now and try again later. But if the upload starts, it might take several minutes to complete. In this case I dont want a timeout to interrupt it. I then only want to give up and throw an error if the upload progress speed slows to a crawl.p  pSo it seems like I want two timeout conditions  a 20 second timeout for the initial connection, and a 10 minute or preferably dynamically computed timeout for upload completion.p  pIs there a way to do this HttpClient.Timeout seems to set a limit on the entire upload, not just the initial connection.p  pIm using HttpClient.PutAsync, and Im monitoring progress by overriding HttpContent.SerializeToStreamAsync.

But in the answer there, it is mentioned to assign the controller as a strong property to mainviewcontroller. But I dont want to use this by creating a property and assigning. Just simply call it on add button click and get the callbacks, just like we use UIActionSheet or UIAlertView.p  pOne more note is that, in my codeClickOnAddcode method, if I remove my custom class and add UIActionSheet itself there, then the callbacks are working fine. Im expecting the same behaviour using my class. How that can be done p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5909 pIm developing an article system that uses categories and child categories. p  pBasically, if the category has a codeparentidcode value, its a child of that category.p  pI would like to be able to get the most recent articles from a category and articles from its child categories.  p  pFor example I have a category called Gaming Articles and several child categories under that called Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and PC.

Negative 5909 pI have a web app that Id like to add the ability to copy HTML and text from... copy it to the clipboard.p  pSo, I fiddled around with Zeroclipboard, couldnt get that to work, and then discovered its no longer being supported  developed anyways.   So, I went with a fork of that, called Zclip.p  pI wanted a single function that I could pass two divs to... where the divbutton that says copy text is... and where the target div we want to copy text to was.   I inserted alerts to tell me how far I was getting  to try to debug it.   The alerts suggested we were handing off the proper div  text to zclip.  But every time I checked my clipboard, the text wasnt there p  pTrying this on FF, IE, and Chrome.p  pSo, I started stripping down my files to try to figure this out.

Negative 5909 pI have created my own layout by subclassing the codeUICollectionViewLayoutcode class, and not the codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutcode one. Hence it seems that I cannot implement the method codecollectionViewlayoutsizeForItemAtIndexPathcode. p  pUnfortunately, I may want to change my cells sizes dynamically. For instance, I have a set a little circular cells around a big cell. When the user exchange a small cell with the big one, I want the little cell to take the location and the size of the big cell, while the big cell would get as small as the little cell and it would take its location. I already managed to do the location exchange with the codemoveItemAtIndexPathtoIndexPathcode method but the cell wont change their size. p  pI understand that the layout is the only responsible for updating items size, but I can assure that I have tried anything and the cells still dont resize. p  pDoes anyone have an idea of what I could do I would be very gratefulp

Negative 5909 pI have an app Im currently working on based on the HTC Open Sense SDK for android. However my biggest problem is keeping up with the device checker through the Google Play dev console to only allow certain devices to download the app. My biggest reason is that people will rate my app so low on the scale and say it sucks, but the problem is that they dont read the requirements  if you use an Lg G2 to try and launch an app made for an HTC ONE that requires Sense, its going to crash.  So, how would i go about building a helper class that would check the devices model via build.prop without needing root privileges before openingstarting the main activity, and give the user a notification if the device was incapable of launching the app, and with devices that are capable of launching it, just continue the process of opening the app p

Negative 5909 pIm trying to attach CSV files to a Rails3 model using paperclip 4.1.1, but Im having trouble getting the contenttype as reported by S3 to be codetextcsvcode instead I am getting codetextplaincode. When I subsequently download the file from S3, the extension is getting changed to match the contenttype instead of preserving the original extension so test.csv is downloaded as test.txt.p  pFrom what I can see, when you upload a file, the FileAdapter will cache the contenttype on creation with whatever value was determined by the ContentTypeDetector which calls codefile b mime filenamecode. Unfortunately, CSV files return codetextplaincode which makes sense, as how can you really distinguish this Attempts to set the contenttype with codeattachment.instancewritecontenttype, textcsvcode only set the value in the model and do not affect what gets written to S3.p  pFileAdapters contenttype initialized here a hrefhttpsgithub.comthoughtbotpaperclipblobv4.0libpaperclipioadaptersfileadapter.rbL14 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comthoughtbotpaperclipblobv4.0libpaperclipioadaptersfileadapter.rbL14ap  pCall which creates that ioadapter a hrefhttpsgithub.comthoughtbotpaperclipblobv4.0libpaperclipattachment.rbL98 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comthoughtbotpaperclipblobv4.0libpaperclipattachment.rbL98ap  pI really have a generic upload here so I cant hardcode the content type in the S3 headers definition in codehasattachedfilecode, and I dont really want the contenttype spoofing protection.

Negative 5909 pi know that you can generate Java classes from an XSD file with JAXB or similar methods and then use them with your resulting XML files.

Negative 5909 pFor fun, and to learn functional programming, Im developing a program in Clojure that does algorithmic composition using ideas from this theory of music called Westergaardian Theory. It generates lines of music where a line is just a single staff consisting of a sequence of notes, each with pitches and durations. It basically works like thisp  ol liStart with a line consisting of three notes the specifics of how these are chosen are not important.li liRandomly perform one of several operations on this line. The operation picks randomly from all pairs of adjacent notes that meet a certain criteria for each pair, the criteria only depends on the pair and is independent of the other notes in the line. It inserts 1 or several notes depending on the operation between the chosen pair. Each operation has its own, unique criteria.li liContinue randomly performing these operations on the line until the line is the desired length. li ol  pThe issue Ive run into is that my implementation of this is quite slow, and I suspect it could be made faster. Im new to Clojure and functional programming in general though Im experienced with OO, so Im hoping someone with more experience can point out if Im not thinking in a functional paradigm or missing out on some FP technique.p  pMy current implementation is that each line is a vector containing maps. Each map has a note and a dur. notes value is a keyword representing a musical note like A4 or C3. durs value is a fraction, representing the duration of the note 1 is a whole note, 14 is a quarter note, etc.... So, for example, a line representing the C major scale starting on C3 would look like thisp  precode[ note C3 dur 1 note D3 dur 1 note E3 dur 1 note F3 dur 1 note G3 dur 1 note A4 dur 1 note B4 dur 1 ] codepre  pLets ignore the problem of using a vector a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq24131932765419thats covered in a different questiona. I want to focus on improving the speed of figuring out which pairs of notes pass the criteria for a given operation.p  pThe problem is, each operation has to see which adjacent note pairs meet its criteria. Currently, this is On where n is the size of the line it simply steps through the entire line and looks at each pair, which means even if I fix the issue of using a vector it would still be slow. However, the nice thing about the criteria check is that it only has to reevaluate notes whose neighbors have changed since the criteria for each pair is independent of the other notes in the line. Im not sure how I would keep track of this in Clojure, so that the algorithm would track which pairs were dirty and which were clean, and be able to only reevaluate note pairs that were dirty. Would it be okay, paradigmwise, to keep track of that using a map to enclose the line, and adding metadata For example, I would have a structure like thisp  precode line [ltthe elements of the linegt] dirty [ltindexes of notes that need to be recheckedgt] valid         operation1 [ltindexes of notes that operation 1 can be performed ongt]        operation2 [ltindexes of notes that operation 2 can be performed ongt]        ...          codepre  pHow could I do something like that but make it a nice abstraction Like, so I wouldnt have to remember how the thing was structured every time I wanted to do stuff to it. Is there some Clojure language feature that would be useful for abstracting this Or is this not a good way to do it Im thinking about how easy it is in OO to abstract away implementation details like this for example, if I want to say that a given note is now dirty I can do something like .setDirtyindex instead of accessing the vector directly. Im sure theres ways to do this in Clojurefunctional programming. p  pDoes this seem like a decent way to track dirty notes How might I code this in Clojure to make it easy to use making a nice abstraction so I dont have to remember how the map is structured.p

Negative 5909 pAccording to definition and work StringBuffer is synchronized, and StringBuilder isnt in Javap  pAs in project we are using multiple files for handling db operation and in many files we are using StringBuffer for appending String.

Negative 5909 pI am a novice programmer, and Ive just started reading about decision tables.  I have read Chapter 18 in Code Complete and it was very enlightening.  I looked around the web to try to find any kind of example of decision tables in ObjectiveC and I was unable to find any boilerplate or real world examples of how to implement this.  p  pI am programming a game in ObjectiveC in my spare time, and I have been dealing with increasing complexity for the rules of the game.  There are a handful of somewhat deeply nested ifelse statements, as well as a few switch statements that already have 10 or more cases to deal with.  I think it would be easier to work with decision tables, but I have no idea how to implement this in ObjectiveC for something nontrivial like the logic of a game.p  pFor example, I need different methods to execute for different combinations of states.  How would I implement a decision table in ObjectiveC that could take different combinations of states as keys, and run specific logic based on the combination of them  p

Negative 5909 pIm using a canvas to host various framework elements. Each framework element is itself a host to a DrawingVisual.p  pEach Framework element that is added at design time, appears fine i.e. as expected in the canvas at runtime.p  pFor those framework elements added at runtime canvas.children.addnew myframework..., they all have a red border. I stress the fact that I am definitely NOT drawing this border  Ive even removed all drawing instructions and still a red border frames each control. If I reintroduce the drawing instructions, this red border appears OVER my drawing, so it appears to be something WPF is doing.p  pThere is no XAML involved  its simply a UserControl hosting a Canvas and it is to this canvas that the framework elements are added. The controls are all contained within the boundaries of the canvas and are not overlapping.p  pCan someone please explain why this border is appearing and how to get rid of it.p  pThanksp

Im using  tutorial a hrefhttphubertvdmsp.blogspot.ca201210sharepointtohighcharts.html relnofollowthisa as my guideline for the code.p  pIm getting the error emUncaught Highcharts error 14 www.highcharts.comerrors14em, which I understand is because Highcharts is expecting the Date value to be a number. I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12485560highchartsreturningerror14herea that I should use parseFloat or parseInt which has not worked.p  pI then tried to generate a line chart using a Number type column instead of the date column and Im receiving the same error which confuses me further.

Please be prepared for angry customers   who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once   they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this   problem.p      pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core   package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage   that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package   namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core   system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.   If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that   the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief,   and lamentation.p blockquote  pClearly, Google are telling me, strongly, not to do this.p  pSo, how are you meant to build the Android v2.1.0 SDKp  pThanks Leep
Negative 5909 pI am fairly new to Meteor and am just trying to figure out meteor security. p  pI am writing a quiz app that allows a logged in user to save their scores. I have created a collection which consists of a user id and an array of scores. The way I expose a push of new score is a method on the server sidep  precodeMeteor.methods    pushScore  functionplayerId, playerScore      UserScores.upsert userId  playerId, push  scores  playerScore     codepre  pI call the method on click of a button from the client like sop  precodeif Meteor.userId   Meteor.callpushScore, Meteor.userId, Session.getscore  codepre  pI have the following concerns herep  ul liObviously the user can manipulate the score value in Session and cheat the system. What could be an alternate secure mechanism to keep track of the running score while a quiz is being takenli liThe other one is probably a bigger concern. How do I prevent the user from just firing a console call to my method pushScore and again cheat the system by adding, say a score of 100 li liIs there an inherent flaw in the way I have designed hereli ul  pThis is just a sample application, but I can easily imagine a real world scenario which could mimic this. What woudl be a best practice in such a scenariop  pThanks in advance.p  pCheers..p
Negative 5909 pI want to have a single ribbon in microsoft office, in which I will have all my addins. Lets say there are 2 addins, both are a single button on the ribbon, which then open a winform. The user installs the first addin, the program checks for an installed ribbon, since there isnt any, it adds the ribbon and the button, which calls the addins function.p  pThen the user installs the second addin later, which, instead of adding the same ribbon, checks if there is already a ribbon with the same name installed, and if there is, it only adds the button to the already installed ribbon, if there isntsomehow the first addin was uninstalled or something it adds the ribbon with the button.p  pSo I thought that in the ThisAddinStartup event I instantiate a RibbonController class. In the RibbonController class i would check for the ribbons existence. Every addin would have a RibbonController classp  pSince Im fairly new in the MS Office Addin programming zone, i need help accessing the ribbons objects and creating it programmatically if it wasnt installed earlier.p

Negative 5909 pstrongBackground Informationstrongp  pI found a bug in some code we have where a function connects to a postgresql database, but then returns out of it before closing the database connection. p  pThis issue was only caught because at one point, we had a huge number of concurrent connections that exceeded the MAXCONNECTIONS value and I found a bunch of idle records in the  pgstatactivity table p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI only see these idle connections if I create a load on the database by looping in my script and calling this function a bunch of times... p  pMeaning, if I use the buggy code that doesnt close the db, and connect once, I dont see any idle records in the pgstatactivity table. Mind you, it takes me a second or two to switch between the window that is running the script and the one that has the psql client running. p  pSo here are my questions.  p  ol lipWhats the best way to track idle connections  Am I using the right approach pli lipAfter the postgresql session selects the data Ive requested and returns it to the client, how long does it wait before killing idle sessions  Or, are these idle records getting killed off when my script has finished running through all its logic pli ol  pIve tried using TCP keep alives with very low values just in case thats relevant... and I get the same results. p  pIf my question is not clear enough, please let me know and I will revise.

Negative 5909 pIm developing an app which performs several HTTP requests to RESTful services by using asynchronous codeNSURLConnectioncode connections and implementing the codeNSURLConnectionDelegatecode protocol to proccess their responses. Users may put the app in background or an interruption may occur before the response is received and delegates codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcode method is called thus, when I say here codebackgroundcode I mean the app to go to backgroundsuspended state, I dont mean tasks being performed in background threads while the app in foreground, so Id need those network requests to continue in background to be completed.p  pIve read the Background Execution section of the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiPhoneConceptualiPhoneOSProgrammingGuideBackgroundExecutionBackgroundExecution.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007072CH4SW1 relnofollowApp Programming Guide for iOSa documentation, but Im not sure which of the given options should I follow for my scenariop  p1 To see my network requests as finitelength tasks and request some extra time to complete them when performing the services callsp  p2 To see them as downloading content in the background I call RESTful services to get some JSON data as response. In such case, it seems that I need to use codeNSURLSessioncode objects...p  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 5909 pI have a complex transaction occurring in my Rails controller layer which involves two levels of associations.p  precodedef archive     client  Client.findparams[id]      client.isarchived  true      client.projects.each do project          project.isarchived  true         project.topics.each  topic topic.active  false          project.save     end      client.save     respondwith client end codepre  pEach client has many projects, and each project has many topics. The above code works, that is, it updates client, projects, and topics as they need to be updated. However, I really want to do one save, as opposed to the multiple saves I have in the code right now. Ive gotten the desired singlesave behavior when updating attributes on one level of association, but for some reason it seems like if I try and do one save for two levels in this case, performing only client.save the only thing that gets updated is client.p  pWhat is the correct Rails method for simultaneously updating two or more levels of Rails associations with one savep

Negative 5909 pcodeRecyclerViewcode has been introduced with Android L and is part of the AppCompat v7 library.

Negative 5909 pIm using pyOpenSSL which is a wrapper for OpenSSL.  I had a client program trying to connect to my server and repeatedly was getting codesslv3 alert bad certificatecode on the server.  It wasnt until I realized it was due to the clients clock being improperly set that I was able to figure out the issue.  Im guessing that the client saw the servers certs as being dated in the future and somehow that resulted in a codesslv3 alert bad certificatecode on the server.p  pIs there any way to get better descriptions as to why a particular cert failed  Im assuming is this case the verification failed on the client side due to the clock not being set right, but the error on the server side is the same as if a bad certificate was sent and the verification failed on the server side.p

Negative 5909 pThis question is the adaptation of a prior question I felt I asked in an unclear way. I am checking whether columns V1 and V2 have common codes by row. Codes are separated by a forward slash . The function below should take one cell from V1 and one cell from V2 on the same row and should transform them into vectors. Each element of a vector is one code. Then the function should check whether the two vectors obtained have elements in common. These elements initially are 4digit codes. If there is any 4digit code that matches between the two vectors, the function should return 4. If there are no elements in common, the function should reduce the number of digits of each code and then check again. Every time that the function reduces the number of digits, it also reduces the score it returns at the end. I would like the value returned by the function to be written in a column of my choice.p  pThis is my starting conditionp  precodestructurelistID  c2630611040, 2696102020, 2696526020, V1  c73713728,  28342833283651228731, 3533354135455084, V2  c7379,  3841, 35333532353113898711, .Names  cID, V1,  V2, class  data.frame, row.names  cNA, 3L           ID                       V1                       V2 1 2630611040                73713728                     7379 2 2696102020 28342833283651228731                     3841 3 2696526020      3533354135455084 35333532353113898711 codepre  pAnd I would like to get thisp  precode          ID                       V1                       V2   V3 1 2630611040                73713728                     7379   3 2 2696102020 28342833283651228731                     3841   0 3 2696526020      3533354135455084 35333532353113898711   4 codepre  pMy function is thisp  precodecoderelatltfunctiona, b  altuniqueas.integerunliststrsplita,  Transforming cells into vectors of codes bltuniqueas.integerunliststrsplitb,   alta[is.naa] bltb[is.nab]  if lengtha0  lengthb0   Check that both cells are not empty    irNA        returnir     else    for i in 31      diffltintersecta, b  See how many products the shops have in common              if lengthdiff0  As you find a commonality, give ir the corresponding scoring                iri1               break               else if i1 amp lengthdiff0  If in the last cycle, there is still no commonality put ir0                ir0               break               else   If there is no commonality and you are not in the last cycle, reduce the nr. of digits and recheck commonality again                alt uniqueas.integersubstras.charactera, 1, i               blt uniqueas.integersubstras.characterb, 1, i                         returnir  codepre  pThe function works when I manually supply single cells.

Negative 5909 pIm new to IOS and Swift, so Ive started by porting Apples Accelerometer example code to Swift.p  pThis was all quite straightforward. Since the Accelerometer API has been deprecated, I used Core Motion instead, and it works just fine. I also switched to a storyboard.p  pThe problem I have is that my layer delegate is only rarely called. It will go for a few minutes and never get called, and then it will get called 40 times a second, and then go back to not being called. If I context switch, the delegate will get called, and one of the sublayers will be displayed, but there are 32 sublayers, and Ive yet to see them all get drawn. Whats drawn seems to be fine  the problem is just getting the delegate to actually get called when I call setNeedsDisplay, and getting all of the sublayers to get drawn.p  pIve checked to be sure that each sublayer has the correct bounds and frame dimensions, and Ive checked to make sure that setNeedsDisplay gets called after each accelerometer point is acquired.p  pIf I attach an instrument, I see that the frame rate is usually zero, but occasionally it will be some higher number.p  pMy guess is that the run loop isnt cycling. Theres actually nothing in the run loop, and Im not sure where to put one. In the ViewDidLoad delegate, I set up an update rate for the accelerometer, and call a function that updates the sublayers in the view. Everything else is event driven, so I dont know what Id do with a run loop.p  pIve tried creating CALayers, and adding them as sublayers. Ive also tried making the GraphViewSegment class a UIView, so it has its own layer. p  pThe version thats written in Objective C works perfectly reliably.p  pThe way that this application works, is that acceleration values show up on the left side of the screen, and scroll to the right. To make it efficient, new acceleration values are written into a small sublayer that holds a graph for 32 time values. When its full, that whole sublayer is just moved a pixel at a time to the right, and a new or recycled segment takes its place at the left side of the screen.p  pHeres the code that moves unchanged segments to the right by a pixelp  precode    for s GraphViewSegment in self.segments           var position  s.layer.position         position.x  1.0         s.layer.position  position         s.layer.hidden  false         s.layer.setNeedsDisplay      codepre  pI dont think that the setNeedsDisplay is strictly necessary here, since its called for the layer when the segment at the left gets a new line segment.p  pHeres how new layers are addedp  precodepublic func addSegment gt GraphViewSegment       Create a new segment and add it to the segments array.     var segment  GraphViewSegmentcoder self.coder      We add it at the front of the array because recycleSegment expects the oldest segment      to be at the end of the array. As long as we always insert the youngest segment at the front      this will be true.     self.segments.insertsegment, atIndex 0   this is now a weak reference       Ensure that newly added segment layers are placed after the text views layer so that the text view      always renders above the segment layer.     self.layer.insertSublayersegment.layer, below self.text.layer      Position it properly see the comment for kSegmentInitialPosition     segment.layer.position  kSegmentInitialPosition     printlnNew segment added     self.layer.setNeedsDisplay     segment.layer.setNeedsDisplay     return segment   codepre  pAt this point Im pretty confused. Ive tried calling setNeedsDisplay all over the place, including the owning UIView. Ive tried making the sublayers UIViews, and Ive tried making them not be UIViews.

So I have to give the user change permission so that the country will be available when user create the client info.p  pGive the change permission is fine, but it would be better if it has a view permission.p  pIve done a lot search and didnt find a perfect solution.p  pI think there must be a lot of people would want this permission as well.p  pSo how to make this custom view permission and integrate with django admin smoothly. p

Negative 5909 pI am using Angular Bootstrap to create a set of 9 tabs, each for a different portfolio that a user can create. If more than 9 portfolios are created by the user, the additional portfolios are displayed in a dropdown menu on the right.

However, if I am viewing a dropdown portfolio, then refresh the page, the first portfolio tab is selected incorrect  no tab should be selected at all, but the dropdown portfolio data is displayed correct. I believe this is because the tabs are displayed before tab.active is being set, and the default tab to be selected is the first if tab.active  true is not present on any tab.

Negative 5909 pI have several gradle projects in my eclipse workspace.  For the sake of simplicity Im only really interested in 2 of them, lets just use A and B for this.p  pSo the problem Im having is that Project A has an included dependency on JBoss, which pulls in javax validationapi 1.0.0.GA, and Project B has a dependency on javax validationapi 1.1.0.Final.  Since Gradle itself resolves the conflict by using the newer library first, B is happy when built by gradle.  But Eclipse itself includes errors which are very distracting while editing.p  pThe correct version of the validationapi jar ends up in Bs class path but the problem is that the Gradle IDE plugin changes the projectA dependency to a project reference, and Eclipse seems to give the project reference precedence over the external jar.  So the old jar is preferred by extension.p  pI tried adding code exclude module validationapi code in Bs build.gradle for the dependency on A which works according to the output of gradle dependencies, however since Eclipse just gets as far as making it a project reference, it wont exclude the jar and the problem remains.p  pAlso per a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions18720565ignoregradletransitiveprojectdependenciesusingeclipsewtpthis questiona I tried adding code transitive  false code and the same thing happens.  I dont think even the hack posed there would work for me since the .classpath contains a single reference to the Gradle container so theres nothing to remove.p  pIve managed to get around this by explicitly including a reference to the correct version of the jar from my gradle cache and then moving it above the Gradle Classpath Container so that eclipse sees that version first.p  pMy question is  Is there a bettermore generic way to do this  Preferably one that I can commit to source control without breaking other peoples builds or requiring them to manually modify paths or properties somewhere  There is another project with what appears to be a similar issue so something I can fix in the build.gradle file would be awesome.p  pWorst case scenario, I could probably switch to IntelliJ if that behaves itself better than the EclipseGradle integrationp

Negative 5909 pMy team has been tasked with converting our applications existing SOAP API to REST. My preference is to rewrite the API from scratch reusing only the actual business logic that each operation performs. Others in my team want to just have REST as a wrapper over the existing SOAP. Meaning we would expose REST services but when a request comes in our application would internally call the existing SOAP operations.p  pCould you please offer suggestions on which of these is the best approach It looks like my way is cleaner and lighter and faster but their way allows some code reuse.p

Negative 5909 pMy assignment requires me to take a list of numbers and then put them in reverse order using SICXE. My problem comes in where I dont actually know how to check whether the reversing actually happened or not so I cant actually tell if my program is working the way that I want it to. I can read the dump and tell where my original list is but I dont understand where I am supposed to see the reversed list to see if what I did actually worked. Im not able to actually find the revered list in here. I assume that it is supposed to start at 15F since that is where BETA starts with 10 Reserved words. But since nothing shows up there I assume that means I have done something wrong but I am not actually sure if I am right about this. If I am how should I go about fixing my problem I will include the .lst file as well as the sic.log file.p  p.lst filep  precode University of North Florida SICXE assembler version date 11122002 account n00832607 Sun Mar  1 224533 2015  ASSEMBLER REPORT       Loc   Object Code       Source Code                 001 00100                      START   100 002 00100 01001E               LDA     30 003 00103 0F2035               STA     INDEX1  .

Negative 5909 pThe same data flow in a SSIS package runs 5 times slower on Production Server.p  pOn Dev, the data flow shifts data from a Development database to text file on a network folder. On the Development Server this process runs in 1 second per file . So ADO.NET Source to Flat File destination with nothing else.p  pOn Production, exactly the same data, the data flow shifts data from a Production Database to text file on the same network folder . On Production the same process runs in 5 seconds per file. Again ADO.net source to Flat File destination.p  pNow obvious difference is the database. Nothing else is different apart from the server the SSIS package is running from.p  pSo what is the best way to determine the bottleneck  Should I separate the source and destination in the data flow to determine which part has the problem. Can I increase the packet size or use fast parse on the flat file to speed things up  Is there a quicker way to work out the problem On Prod I am limited to what I can test. This is the only place the problem happens. Will Performance counters help me  Is there a special diagnostics package someone has that may helpp  pA lot of ideas come flowing to my head. The question to focus on is how to work out what the bottleneck is in less than 5 minutes p

Well, Im trying to do the opposite.p  pIve spent the day playing around and studying a wide range of different ways to adjust the way a table displays. Ive got it pretty much perfect although my use of multiple methods to get there might be a bit sloppy, but hey, Im learning. The only issue is my Frame, its a tiny bit too small for the table. The last few characters of text in my last column only the records with long names in them get cut off.p  pSo, right now I have two ways that Im considering approaching this, and Im having trouble figuring out both. 1 expand the size of the frame, but set the table to have a fixed size and exist only in the center of the frame with empty space on both sides. 2 set the size of the frame based on the size of the table.p  pHaving trouble figuring out how to do either of these. Pasting my code below.p  pThe only parts that wont be there are 1 TableColumnAdjuster, a class with mechanisms to adjust TableColumns found on WordPress.

Negative 5909 pIve run into an error with a test WPF application that Im using to learn Prism. The error log is below, but the gist of it is that it cant seem to find Microsoft.Practices.Unity version 3.5.1.0. From my understanding this can mean two things either it cant find any version of Unity, or its finding the wrong version number of Unity.p  pTo rule out the first option at least I believe this rules it out I double checked that the dll is installed in the projects that need it and in the bin folder there is only one copy of Unity within each project and the bin folder. It is installed, but per the properties description it says that the version is 3.5.0.0. Per the Object Browser it says the dll is in a folder titled Unity.3.5.1404.0. Note that the dll was installed using NuGet, and the two groups of packages I installed are called Prism and Prism.UnityExtensions. Its the second one that the Unity dll is in.p  pWhats interesting is that I actually started a new tutorial project to see if itd fix the issue, and copied over some pieces of the projects from the original one. I was able to compile and run it the first time, but then I took out the section of code below from the App.config file just to see what would happen dumb mistake... and started getting the same error. This is even after I added it back to the App.config file. Note that the code below was in the App.config file when I created the project its not something I personally added later.p  pIs there somewhere else I should look for rogue Unity dlls that might be causing issues Is there something I need to add or remove so that the current Unity dll will workp  hr  pCode where error is happening on bootstrapper.Run this is in App.xaml.csp  precodeprotected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e              base.OnStartupe          Bootstrapper bootstrapper  new Bootstrapper         bootstrapper.Run      codepre  hr  pCodep  precode  ltstartupgt     ltsupportedRuntime versionv4.0 sku.NETFramework,Versionv4.5 gt   ltstartupgt   ltruntimegt     ltassemblyBinding xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1gt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameMicrosoft.Practices.ServiceLocation publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 cultureneutral gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion0.0.0.01.2.0.0 newVersion1.2.0.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameMicrosoft.Practices.Prism.SharedInterfaces publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 cultureneutral gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion0.0.0.01.1.1.0 newVersion1.1.1.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameMicrosoft.Practices.Unity publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 cultureneutral gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion0.0.0.03.5.1.0 newVersion3.5.1.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt     ltassemblyBindinggt   ltruntimegt codepre  hr  pErrorp  blockquote   pSystem.IO.FileLoadException was unhandled     HResult2146234304     MessageCould not load file or assembly Microsoft.Practices.Unity, Version3.5.1.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 or one of its dependencies.

Negative 5909 pIve created a library of predefined colours for use in Swift and ObjectiveC and Ive rewritten a plugin for Xcode that previews the colour in the editor so that it works with my library along with a few other changes.p  pThe plugin currently has a list of the colours thats created.  Im not thrilled with this solution since it means that anytime I change the list of colours I have to modify my code here too.  Plus I dont like having a data structure hanging around holding approximately 1500 colours and strings.  Doesnt seem to be that efficient or elegant.p  pWhat Id like to do is instead of storing all of the colours in memory is to call the proper function of NSColor when it comes across the function name in the code.  Ive found that I can check to see if NSColor responds to a selector with the function respondsToSelector but calling performSelector doesnt meet my needs since I need the return value from the call.  p  pSo is there a way to go from this.p  precodelet colourDict [ String  NSColor ]  [     blackColor  NSColor.blackColor,     whiteColor  NSColor.whiteColor ] ...  let foundColour  colourDict[ colourMethodName ] codepre  pTo something like this.p  precodeif  NColor.respondsToSelector  Selector  colourMethodName        foundColour  NSColor.performSelector  Selector  colourMethodName    codepre  pObviously it wouldnt be the performSelector function itself but Im looking for that type of functionality except that it would be returning back the NSColor object.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5909 pwe want to setup an incremental build for a C solution with 12 sub projects. Our first approach is to store the build output, object and symbol files from the current masterbranch of our Git repository and reuse them on a Jenkins CIbuild of a developer change.p  pThis means we copy files to the build workspace directory and hope that MSBuild will recognize reusable objects. Now we reset the build output to the master revision for the next CI build. As long as we build sequentially this will not break.p  pHow can we achieve parallel CI builds  Our solution build will generate about 13 Gb of output and therefore a copy or fetch from a binary repository will take about 5 minutes.p  pIn my eyes this is an unnecessary waste of time. If we had a virtual file system which allows to operate parallel on a master branch snapshot, but still is able to let each Jenkinsbuild change files in parallel, we would save a lot of time.p  pDo you know possibilities to achieve this  p

Negative 5909 pI have a project that Ive been working on that uses polymorphism to implement the encoding of objects via overriding an codeencodecode function.p  pNow, this project has been using pointers to implement the polymorphic behavior. Since my application was relatively new, I decided that it wouldnt be too difficult to switch from regular raw pointers into smart pointers, as they would automatically manage memory.p  pIn one of my functions, I return an codestduniqueptrcode. After returning the smart pointer, I immediately wanted to cast the underlying raw pointer. So an oversimplification of what was happening would look something like thisp  precodestduniqueptrltsomethinggt dosomething      return stduniqueptrltsomethinggtnew something   void caller      auto output  staticcastltanothergtdosomething.get      Do something with output...  codepre  pI knew that codestduniqueptrcode doesnt have a copy constructor, as it can only be owned once at any given instant. Implementing a copy constructor would allow for the creation of a duplicate pointer, going against this principle. If my understanding is correct, the following code initializes codeBcode using the move constructor, and does not copy codeAcodep  precodestduniqueptrltintgt geta      stduniqueptrltintgt Anew int     return A   void getb     auto B  geta  codepre  pThis was exactly the behavior that I wanted. However, in my example, the program crashes around half of the time. The other half of the time, it emappearsem to work, but the contents of the underlying pointer are just plain garbage. Im suspecting that this was undefined behavior, and codegetcode was only sometimes returning a readable address.p  pNow, after some thought, I came to the conclusion that if codeBcode was indeed being initialized via a move constructor, codeBcode itself would have to strongnotstrong be a temporary.

Negative 5909 pI have a container that is quite similar to an image slider, and designed for horizontal touchmouse drag to move between slides. For aesthetics, an easing function is applied so that it glides into place centered on each slide when released. The method of movement is transform translateX.p  pThe problem Im currently having is that, if the user releases, then touches and and moves it again while its already in motion, it will jump to the slide at the end of its transition. So for example if you are in slide 1, move it and release while its in the zone for slide 2, and then try to move again while it still in motion, it will jump to slide 2 immediately, and then move from there to wherever I move my finger.p  pWhat Im essentially looking for is a way to get the intermediate transition distance while the translation animation is running. Is there any way to measure where an element actually is in the middle of transition If not, what are some solutions for this situationp  pEDIT I found out the root cause to my issue, although it doesnt change the focus of the question. To give a broader explanation of what was going on, Ill include it here.p  pThe default transition duration time was set to 300ms. When a user drags on the content by mouse or by touch, this was set to 0ms so that it wouldnt lag behind the users movements. When released, it would be set back to 300ms. If it was grabbed again while it was in motion, it would take the position it was transitioning to and snap there when the duration was set to 0ms. This was better than then alternative of allowing it to continue to flow there while dragging again, as the content would slide under the drag point.p
Negative 5909 pIm developping a webapplication in Symfony2. The website is supposed to have a database per client.

What is the best way to make sure a user cannot change the route parameter to a different client and get accessp  pIve been looking for guides on the internet to do what I need to do.

Negative 5909 pIve been creating a metrics module using timeseries with c3js. Im now trying to plot out events over my metrics data, which are datespans startDate to endDate. Using c3js regions seemed to be a good choice for it, it only took a little tinkering to make them short and appear above of all my graphed data.p  pProblem is, the actual SVG Group called codeg.c3regionscode is automatically displayed behind the graphed data. Makes sense, there hasnt been any real need allow any user interaction with regions. I need it in the forefront, so I can bind codehovercode and codeclickcode functions to each event.p  pI tried doing this with jQuery code.c3regions.insertAfter.c3chartcode, which simply places it in front. Works fine  that is, until my c3js instance rerenders. Then it spits out an error that its having trouble rerendering the regions since they obviously movedp  pIve also tried cloning it and putting that in front, but it doesnt seem to copy over the SVG information.p  pAny help would be truly appreciated, can provide any code samples on request.p  pCheers   Andrewp

Negative 5909 pWe are running security checks on our REST services and noticed that if a codeHostcode header is set, it is overriding the original serverhost which is causing our returned URLs to use that host instead of the server.p  pUsing Fiddler I can recreate the problem since it takes into account codeHostcode headers unlike browsers. The request, as seen here has 3 codeHostcode headers for testing purposes a hrefhttpi.imgur.comzrQhLOV.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comzrQhLOV.pngap  pOur response URLs are, consequently, using the codetest2.comcode host instead of the desired codelocalhostcode.p  pWe have a series of filters defined in our codeweb.xmlcode that modify the request, however the server listed in the requests are still pointing to the wrong host.p  pI tried implementing a a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orgresteasydocs1.1.GAuserguidehtmlInterceptors.htmlPreProcessInterceptors relnofollowcodePreProcessInterceptorcodea thinking that I might be able to catch the request and modify the codeHostcode headers.
