Positive 58299 pI am using jQuery to create a somewhat interactive eBay listing, and so of course I am using the probably well known method to load jQuery into eBay. While I have tested the result across many browsers, it has become obvious that some users of iPhones seem to have an issue with certain interactive elements of the HTMLjavascript.p  pI believe I have narrowed this down to older iPhone 4s and below, more specifically iOS 4.p  pFollowing further testing I think it seems like there is just something wrong with the way this OS or potentially just the iPhone browser processes javascript. The first issue I noticed was that onclick events were not working when I defined them as followsp  precode  .divs.onclick,functione      stuff    codepre  pThis seems to be fixable by simply making the entire function inline, ie, codeonclickjavascript etccode, its not particularly pretty but it seems to work.p  pThe second issue, and this is one that I havent been able to figure a way around so far, is that using a loading script of the following format just doesnt seem to workp  precode    ltscript async typetextjavascriptgt         var resource  document.createElementscript         resource.src  http....jquery1.10.2jquery.min.js         var script  document.getElementsByTagNamescript[0]         script.parentNode.insertBeforeresource, script     ltscriptgt codepre  pSo from what I can tell there is some part of the above script that iPhone iOS4 browser just doesnt like. I would rather not try to rewrite the entire page to not use any externally loaded scripts, and I am not even sure its possible for the interactivity I want to achieve, so any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 58299 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am capturing video using the video4linux 2 spec.  It is captured using a C program in realtime.  I also have a Java frontend that can run both locally and remotely.  The remote side was easy, I just compress the images to JPEG and ship them over a minihttp server to the client that decompresses them and shows them on the screen.p  pWhen we run locally, I would like some way IPC to connect directly to that memory and access the images from Java.  Then, blit those to the screen using as little CPU power as possible.  This is a surveillance type system so I could have 816 camera feeds running at a time.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat is the most efficient way to move the image data YUV420P from the v4l2 mmap buffer to my Java app to display it on the screen  Please show code or point me to some apispecs if any are available.p  pstrongAnswerstrongp  pIn the interest of time, I decided to just use plain Sockets and send the data in RGB.  I was able to drastically improve performance when the Java client is running on the same machine.  Im still sending JPEGs over the network if the client is running remotely.  Next, Ill need to find an optimized JPEG decoder.p  pBy the way, this is not 2 clients, just my CameraStream widget reads and parses both types.p

Negative 58299 pI want to be able to use a Greasemonkey script that can take an image from a page, scan it for the darkest pixel, and then return those coordinates to the browser.p  pOriginally, I used a flash script... Greasemonkey embedded a local flash file that would fetch the image based on a URL in the source of the webpage, use ActionScript to get the darkest pixel, and then send a POST request with those coordinates as values.p  pThe problem is, I only want to download the image one time. With this method, it does it twice once in browser, once in flash. Is there a way to manipulate an image from a webpage within Javascript or with another clientside language I tried using a Canvas, but you cannot perform the getImageData function on images hosted on remote servers.p

Negative 58299 pI have used XSLT for a few different things over the years. I got used to it, but never felt like I really understood it all the way through. It always seems like I have to experiment to get the result I want, and the outcome isnt necessarily a logical conclusion in hindsight.p  pOn top of that, the one or two times I had to turn over something written using XLST to someone else, it represented a huge barrier to entry. Functional programming is unfamiliar to the average coder or scripter and the learning curve is very steep.p  pXML is here to stay, and there will always be a need to manipulate it somehow. There are frameworks that use XML that are perhaps less used than they could be because they lean heavily on XSLT for presentation.p  pI am not opposed to XPATH. In fact, I consider it to be straightforward and quite useful.p  pI mostly work in Java and Python, but Im more concerned with the general problem of how to work with XML without needing XSLT. If there is an effective set of tools for dealing with this in C, for instance, then thats a start.p  pSo, is there an alternativep

I also use the GetLists web service just after this but it runs provided the user has Reader permissions.p  pI only use the GetWeb call in order to get the WebId which the GetList call requires as a param. I got round my permissions problem by passing the WebId into the form opposed to having the form look it up. So all is okay now. p  pHowever, I would like to know why GetWeb requires higher permissions and howif these permissions can be controlled. Ive not found any documentation on the permissions that the different out of the box web services require, let alone how you change them.p  p[NOTE] Im not using data connection files for a reason, but thankyou for suggesting them anyway.p

Negative 58299 pA rough definition of a data structure is that it allows you to store data and apply a set of operations on that data while preserving consistency of data before and after the operation. However some people insist that a primitive variable like int can also be considered as a data structure. I get that part where it allows you to store data but I guess the operation part is missing. Primitive variables dont have operations attached to them. So I feel that unless you have a set of operations defined and attached to it you cannot call it a data structure. int doesnt have any operation attached to it, it can be operated upon with a set of generic operators.p  pPlease advise if I got something wrong here.p

Negative 58299 pWe are currently doing an web application which one of the functionality is to create Events by the user. Those events can be later on deleted by the user or administrator. However the client requires that the event is not really physically deleted from database, but just marked as deleted. User should only see nondeleted events, but administrators should be able to browse also through deleted ones. Thats all really the functionality there is.p  pNow I suggested that we should simply add one more extra column called status, which would have couple of valid values ACTIVE and DELETED. This way we can distinguish between normalactive and deleted events and create really simple queries SELECT  FROM EVENTS WHERE STATUS  ACTIVE.  My colleague however disagreed. He pointed out that regardless of the fact that right now active events and deleted events share same information thus they can be stored in the same table in a future requirements my change and client for example  will need to store some additional information about deleted Event like date of deletion, who deleted it, why he did it  sort of comment. He said that to fulfil those requirements in a future we would have to add additional columns in EVENTS table that would hold data specific for the deleted Events and not for active events. He proposed a solution, where additional table is created like DELETEDEVENTS with same schema as EVENTS table. Every deleted event would be physical deleted from EVENTS table and be moved to DELETEDEVENTS table.p  pI strongly disagreed with his idea. Not only would it make SQL query more complex and less efficient but also this totally is against YAGNI. I also disagreed with him that my idea would made us to create additional not nullable columns in EVENTS table, if the requirements changed in a future. In my scenario I would simply create new table like DELETEDEVENTSDATA that would hold those additional, archive data and would add reference key in the EVENTS table to maintain one to one relationship between EVETNS and DELETEDEVENTSDATA tables.p  pNevertheless I was struggled by the fact that two developers who commonly share similar view on software and database design could have so radically different opinions about how this requirements should be designed in a database level.  I thought that we maybe both going in a wrong direction and there is another third solution Or are there more then  just one alternative How do you design this sort of requirements Are there any patterns or guidelines on how to do it properly Any help will be deeply appreciated p

Systems like Arch or     Bitkeeper are built the other way around theyre designed to manage     changesets as first order objects the repository is a bag of     patches, and trees are derived by composing sets of patches together.p blockquote  pBut its not clear how subversion repository stores changes, whether it contain oldest variant of versioned file and so on.

Negative 58299 pIm trying to solve a design issue using inheritance based polymorphism and dynamic binding. I have an abstract superclass and two subclasses. The superclass contains common behaviour. SubClassA and SubClassB define some different methods SubClassA defines a method performTransform, but SubClassB does not.p  pSo the following examplep  precode1 var vSuperClass  2 var bSubClassB  new SubClassB  3 v  b  4 v.performTransform codepre  pwould cause a compile error on line 4 as performTransform is not defined in the superclass. We can get it to compile by casting...p  precodev as SubClassA.performTransform codepre  phowever, this will cause a runtime exception to be thrown as v is actually an instance of SubClassB, which also does not define performTransformp  pSo we can get around that by testing the type of an object before casting itp  precodeif typeof v  SubClassA    cast v to SubClassA.performTransform  codepre  pThat will ensure that we only call performTransform on vs that are instances of SubClassA. Thats a pretty inelegant solution to my eyes, but at least its safe. I have used interface based polymorphism interface meaning  a type that cant  be instantiated and defines the API of classes that implement it in the past, but that also feels clunky. For the above case, if SubClassA and SubClassB implemented ISuperClass  that defined performTransform, then they would both have to implement performTransform. If SubClassB had no real need for a performTransform you would have to implement an empty function. p  pThere must be a design pattern out there that addresses the issue. p

Negative 58299 pI finally decided to give SpringSource Tool SuiteSTS a try this morning, only to find that it is not compatible with the current version of Eclipse Im using.3.6p  pSo, before making another attempt, I thought I would asks you guys if its worth getting it.p  pUsually Im not a big fan of adding a heavy weight plugin like STS to my Eclipse IDE because of compatibility and upgrade issues, but the amount of XML Ill have to write kind of scared me, so thats why I made an exception to it.p  pDoes STS indeed make your programming experience with Spring much easier, or can you make do without it Also how stable is it For example, I had a few crashes while using the JPA feature of the Eclipse Java EE and Im not using it any more because of that.p

This has been very informative and helpful. Special shoutouts to strongbobincestrong, strongLie Ryanstrong, strongGumbostrong, strongJeffrey Zhengstrong, and strongLarry Kstrong, for their indepth and thoughtful analyses. I awarded the check mark to strongLarry Kstrong for pointing me toward a solution my question failed to foresee, but I upticked every answer I found useful.p  pThe consensus appears to be thatp  ol lipChinese and Japanese character strings are sorted by Unicode code points, and their ordering may be predicated on a rationale that may be in some way intelligible to knowledgeable readers but is not likely to be of much practical value in helping users to find the information theyre seeking.pli lipThe kind of compare function that would be required to make a sort semantically or phonetically useful is far too cumbersome to consider pursuing, especially since the results would probably be less than satisfactory, and in any case the comparison algorithms would have to be changed for each language. Best just to allow the sort to proceed without even attempting a compare function.pli lipI was probably asking the wrong question here. That is, I was thinking too much inside the box without considering that the real question is not how do I make sorting useful in these languages, but how do I provide the user with a useful way of finding items in a list. Westerners automatically think of sorting for this purpose, and I was guilty of that. Larry K pointed me to a Wikipedia article that suggests stronga filtering function might be more useful for Asian readersstrong. This is what I plan to pursue, as its at least as fast as sorting, clientside. I will keep the column sorting because its well understood in Western languages, and because speakers of any language would find the sorting of dates and other numericalbased data types useful. But I will also add that filtering mechanism, which would be useful in long lists for any language.pli ol

Negative 58299 pAs we know that there are different types of JOINs in any RDBMS, for eg Left join, outer join, inner join, left outer join etc. Invariably we use JOINs for lots of our business logics in our projects.

My area of interest would be mostly related to SQL Server since we are using that in almost all our projects.p  pI have gone through some nice articles on JOINs but most of them tend to confuse rather than convince. So I wanted to know if there are any good waysmethods or any good tutorials for getting a good grasp on JOINs in SQL.

It needs an enumerator too in the TXmlFileList classbr How to create that enumeratorbr br br br Youre probably wondering why I use this complex construction. Well, it might be complex but it will be used by some other developers and I dont want to provide more methods than they need. This way, I only give them the methods Add, Clear and Count to loop through the list, and any property defined on the TItem itself. They dont need more than this, although I might add a few more features later on...p

But if I provide all hdpiimages in resdrawable instead of 3 different ones, wont Android just DOWNscale those images if the size is too bigbr If thats true, I could save some APKspace by just a third of the images.p  pFollowUp question I read that for APIlevel 3 a dir by the name drawablev3 is required. Is that true or is drawable the fallback for this APIlevel alsop  pAny hint is appreciated.p

Negative 58299 pI have a large sequence of datamaps and each map needs to be classified in a nested fashion.p  pi.e. a given item may be an A or a B as determined by a function, if it is a B then it may be a C or a D determined by another function and so on down.

Negative 58299 pSo I am still somewhat new to PHP, MySQL, and Javascript but I have been working on a project so I have been learning fast. However, I feel like in my php pages I am mixing too much HTML and PHP. At first I thought it was standard practice but someone on SO informed me of how you should not mix the two and I began looking at my code.p  pFor example, when loading a page of submissions I have a loop that looks something like this condensed version p  precodeltphp while row  mysqlfetchassocsubmissionQuery    submissionID  row[id] gt   ltdiv classsubmission idsubmissionltphp echo submissionID gtgt     lth3gtltphp echo row[title] gtlth3gt   ltdivgt ltphp  gt codepre  pThe reason why I dont just enclose the entire block in PHP is because there is not only an h3 there and I dont want to use massecho statements.p  pIn my opinion this looks terrible and Id like to know a better way of doing it. I suppose that I could store all the submissions in to an array and then loop through them later on but I see several downsides to thisp  p1 Unnecessarily storing values in to an array. Only going to recall them immediately after.p  p2 If there are a lot of submissions there may not be enough memory to store them.p  p3 Would require more code.p  p4 Would still have to loop through the array later on and in that case I am still mixing PHP and HTML just to a lesser degreep  pI dont know. I just need some advice as to best handle this because I dont want to do things the wrong way and then have to refactor everything later on when something breaks or gets too complex.p

Negative 58299 pI have a general question about correlation in BizTalk.  I have an orchestration.  In the middle of this orchestration, I send a message via an outbound solicitresponse port.  My expectation was that if the port was solicitresponse, that the BizTalk adapter communicating with the end system would automatically know to correlate the response message with the request message by promoting a necessary property.  This way, when the response message arrived in the message box, the correct orchestration instance would receive the message.p  pThis doesnt seem to be the case.  Even in this requestresponse scenario within an orchestration, I need to manually define a correlation set to get this to work.  strongCan someone confirm that correlation is always necessary when receiving a message in the middle of an orchestration, even in the case of sending a message via a solicitresponse portstrongp  pIm currently working with the DB2 adapter.  Because the adapter doesnt automatically correlate the response to the request, we are modifying the stored procs on the DB2 side so that it will accept an input parameter, that it will return to us in the response.  We then use this parameter to correlate the request and response.  Are there any other ways to do a manual correlation assuming that the messages themselves dont contain enough properties to correlate onp  pThank youp

Negative 58299 pSo its possible to align the top, bottom, left, and right of one view with another so that their edges are flush with each other. However, Ive been wondering if its possible to align the centers of two views of different sizes. My situation occurs when I have an ImageView side by side with a TextView, like this [ImageView] [TextView]. The ImageView is bit taller than the TextView and so what I do is add paddingmargins to the bottom of TextView to get it align and look like the ImageView and TextView horizontal centers are aligned. Problem is, when this view is displayed on larger tablet screens, the padding and margins dont work out right and the TextView doesnt look aligned with the ImageView. Im sure there is an easy fix to allow this to always work out, so could someone provide me with some insights Thanksp
Negative 58299 pI have a very weird problem with one of my IIS application pool processes. Ive been getting a System.OutOfMemoryException error lately and ive been trying to figure out exactly what is going on. Basically I have a script that uses a web service to get a file from our DAM. It then checks the file stores it a byte array, then uses the Response to output the file. The only one ive been having problems with is the PDFs when they are over 20MB now it seems that they cause an error sometimes. If I increase the memory in the app pool it fixes the problem temporarily. I watched the w3wp.exe process and seen that sometimes when I run this script it increase the memory up to 400MB the largest file we have is 45MB what would be causing this type of behavior to happen. The problem seems to go away every night and in the morning it will work for a while and then start doing the same thing again. This application is c asp.net application. It run inside of sharepoint.p  pAfter watching the service for a while I did notice that since these PDFs are rendered in the browser window that until the file downloads completely it doesnt release from memory. which makes sense but I can see that this is somewhat of my problem. If I have several people loading the file, with a average no file downloading memory usage at 385,000 kb.It can easily get to 900,0001,100,000 KB which is the limit of the application pool.p  pIm not so much looking for an exact answer but more like a direction to head because I am all out of ideas.p

I know the problem with it is p  precode  Writer.addKeyListenernew KeyAdapter          Override         public void keyTypedKeyEvent e              ife.getKeyChar gt e.VKA ampamp e.getKeyCharlt e.VKZ  e.getKeyChar gt a ampamp e.getKeyCharltz e.getKeyChar  b   Checks to make sure No Numbers                              Writer.setEditabletrue                           else                               Writer.setEditablefalse                           iffont.equalsArial                              ifsize.equals8                                      setSize  8                                  else ifsize.equals10                                      setSize  10                                  else ifsize.equals12                                      setSize  12                                   ifcolor.equalsBlack                                      setColor  Color.BLACK                                  else ifcolor.equalsBlue                                      setColor  Color.BLUE                                  else ifcolor.equalsRed                                      setColor  Color.red                                   Font font  new FontArial, setAttribute,    setSize                 Writer.setFontfont  I Know that this sets the font everytime, so im pretty sure this is where my problem is.

Negative 58299 pI am writing an application in XNA that relies on render targets that are rendered to just once, and then used indefinitely afterwards. The problem Ive encountered is that there are certain situations where the render targets contents are lost or disposed, such when the computer goes to sleep or the application enters fullscreen mode.p  pRerendering to each target when content is lost is an option, but likely not the best option, as it could be fairly costly when there are many targets.p  pI could probably save each result as a PNG image and then load that PNG back up as a texture, but that adds a lot of IO overhead.p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 58299 pTwo closelyrelated data structures are the suffix tree and suffix array.  From what Ive read, the suffix tree is faster, more powerful, more flexible, and more memoryefficient than a suffix array.  However, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2487576trievssuffixtreevssuffixarray67233226723322this earlier question,a one of the top answers mentioned that suffix arrays are more widely used in practice.  I dont have any experience using either of these structures, but right now it seems like I would always prefer a suffix tree over a suffix array for problems that needed the functionality they provide fast substring checking, for example.p  pIn what circumstances would a suffix array be preferable to a suffix treep  pBy the way, while this question is related to the one Ive linked, I dont think its an exact duplicate as Im interested solely in a comparison of suffix arrays and suffix trees, leaving tries completely out of the picture.  If you disagree, though, I would understand if this question were to be closed.p

Negative 58299 pbecause I did something really bad in the past, I have to insert an empty commit at beginning for a rebase. When doing the described steps of the solution found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions645450githowtoinsertacommitasthefirstshiftingalltheothersgit how to insert a commit as the first, shifting all the othersa I struggle at the emrebaseem command because of many mergeconflicts. Some are so complicated that it is almost impossible for me to solve them. Most of them have following structurep  precodeABC   B changes file foo.txt               D and E change file file.txt     DE       git rebase tries to apply B on D due to time stamp.. codepre  pWhen searching around, I found that git provides with rerere a tool for applying already solved conflicts. Unfortunately I did not know it before so it was not turned on. Is it possible to activate it and emscanem the history for resolutions Or is there a different way to achieve the same result Or do I have no other possibility than solving everything by handp  pThanks in advance,p  pTiBop

Negative 58299 pFellow coders, I have asked this question before but did not get a conclusive answer to it. The question is how much data can i safely return from and ajax post call before i run into some limitation somewhere  p  pThe scenarios are basically like this frontend makes an ajax call to a php controllermodel. the controller returns a bunch or rows from the database or returns some html representing some report which will be stored in a js string var to be displayed later.p  pI see two limitations here the size of the data returned through the ajax call and max size the js var can hold.  p  pAnyone knows what the limits arep  pthanksp

Negative 58299 pI develop a mysql database that will contain the country,city and occupation of each user. While I can use a country table and then insert the id of the country into the user table, I still have to look for the perfect method for the other two tables.p  pThe problem is that the city and occupation of each user are taken from an input field, meaning that users can type NYC or New York or New York City and millions of other combinations for each town, for example.p  pIs it a good idea to disregard this issue, create an own town table containing all the towns inserted by users and then put the id of the town entry into the user table or would it be more appropriate to use a VARCHAR column town in the user table and not normalize the database concerning this relation I want to display the data from the three tables on user profile pages.p  pI am concerned about normalization because I dont want to have too much redundant data in my database because it consumes a lot of space and the queries will be slower if I use a varchar index instead of an integer index for example as far as I knowp  pThanksp

Negative 58299 pDoes anyone else experience issues with html5 boilerplate with chrome 16.0.912.63  Just downloaded it and when I open index.html it takes about 40 seconds to render.  Looking in Chrome developer tools it appears that the protocol relative urlp  precodeajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.6.2jquery.min.js codepre  pis causing the issue.  If I add the codehttpcode to the URL it seems to retrieve jquery in a reasonable amount of time, but then the modernizr.js script has issues retrieving ga.js.p  pI assume there are many people using boilerplate with Chrome, but I didnt see anything on the boilerplate site that indicates this a common problem.  Is it possible I have configured something incorrectlyp

Negative 58299 pI need to find out what the current Row index from within a codeforeachcode loop.p  precodeforeach DataRow row in DataTable[0].Rows       I do stuff in here with the row, and if it throws an exception      I need to pass out the row Index value to the catch statement  codepre  pAn exception can occur at any point within the codetrycatchcode block, but if I use an incremental counter within the codeforeachcode loop, and the exception occurs outside of the loop, Ill get an invalid row because Ive moved the pointer along by one.p  pI know that I can declare a codeDataRowcode outside of the codeforeachcode scope, but the codeforeachcode is within a codetrycatchcode block.  I need to pass the Row index so I can use it in the codecatchcode statement.  I should say that my codeDataTablecode is at class level scope.  p  pIs this really the only way to get the current Row index  Or is there a cleaner implementationp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo, giving more thought to this, I could use an codeintcode to store the current row value, and increment this value like sop  precodeint i  0  try       Some code here  which could throw an exception     foreach DataRow row in DataTables[0].Rows               My stuff         i           Some code here  which could throw an exception  catch       Use the counter     DataRow row  DataTables[0].Rows[i]  codepre  pHowever, if the codeforeachcode doesnt throw the exception, then the value of codeicode will be greater than the actual number of rows in the table.  Obviously, I could do codeicode after the codeforeachcode loop, but this seems like a emreallyem dirty hack.p

Negative 58299 pI find myself in the strange situation of diamond inheritance, even worse is that the classes in the middle of the diamond share a member. Below Ive shown a cut down piece of code which highlights my problem.p  pThe method I used in writing classes I have learnt from a hrefhttprhettinger.wordpress.com20110526superconsideredsuper relnofollowhttprhettinger.wordpress.com20110526superconsideredsupera which is linked on the python documentation site for the builtin function codesupercodep  precodeclass Aobject     pass  class BA     def initself, zNone, kwargs         self.z  z         superB, self.initkwargs          superB, self.initzz, kwargs  class CA     def initself, zNone, kwargs         self.z  z         superC, self.initkwargs  class DB, C     pass  d  Dzy  for arg, value in d.dict.iteritems     print arg, , value codepre  pwhich gives output    p  precodez  None codepre  pThe problem is that the method of using keyword arguments to ensure the signatures of the functions match takes away the z argument from class Cs init call. I can forcibly add the argument back into kwargs see commented code but then this results in me not being able to instantiate an object of type B since this will result in a call to the init of object which takes no parameters, this is a nice feature because it prevents me putting in invalid arguments when instantiating any of the below object.p  pAlso I noticed that if I have the line super before I set the variables then the problem is fixed since the highest level object will overwrite the lower levels. However my code is heavily built around have the super at the end since all the actual setting is carried out by the low ever level classes whilst the higher level classes pass the value to be set down the chain of inheritance. Are there guidelines on where to fit in parent callsp  pAny ideas Stackoverflowp  pthanksp  pp.s. Is this just a bad design of cooperative classes What is a cooperative class exactlyare there rules or guidelines one should followp  peditp  pStackoverflow wont let me answer my own question but I came up with a solution.p  pI dont think there should be ever any shared members between cooperative classes. If ever there are two classes which are independent of each other in the sense there is no is a kind of relationship which share a member then you should add a level of abstraction into the inheritance relationship.p  pThe shared member should be taken out and put into a separate class which inherits from a shared base class and is inherited from by the classes in the diamond.p  pBelow is the corrected code. In keeping with the link in the OP I introduced a Root base class p  pI should point out I have had no formal programming education like most here I guess so apologies if I use wrong terminology.p  precodeclass Rootobject     pass  class ARoot     pass  class HasAZRoot     def initself, zNone, kwargs         self.z  z         superHasAZ, self.initkwargs  class BHasAZ, A     pass   class CHasAZ, A     pass  class DB, C     pass  d  Dzy  for arg, value in d.dict.iteritems     print arg, , value codepre

Negative 58299 pI often work with 3D CAD models, which I receive as SolidWorks or PDF files.  I need to turn them into black amp white line art, like youd find in a patent application.  In fact, emexactlyem like what you find in a patent applicationp  pAcrobat9 allows me to rotate amp scale the models, so I can print them with reasonable resolution, but the rest of my drawing toolchain deals with SVG files, while all I can get out of Acrobat is bitmaps.  I also make models from scratch in Blender, and make line drawings using rendering procedures there, but that also produces bitmaps.p  pIs there some way to get from a 3D view to an SVG picture preferably with relatively simple Bezier curves and scaled line weightsp  pAs an example, imagine that I have a 3D model of a cube.  I position it as desired, then somehow convert it to an SVG image with several straight lines where the edges are, with the line weights scaled according to the distance between the edge and the cameraviewer.p

Negative 58299 pI have created an html file by using rendertostring in a controller and senddata to send the html file to the user. That works great and the file I get back matches the html I see when I right click and view page source in my browser.

Or another example lightbox.css.erb instead of lightbox.css. p  pAlso, some of the paths in the html are wrong, for example images are located in appassetsimages, but the html is looking in appassets. The pathing is not an issue since I can just edit the generated html with nokogiri, but I am curious as to why they are different.p  pThis is pretty much exactly what I want to do a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1080565railsemulatesavepageasbehaviourrails emulate quotSave page asquot behaviourap  pExcept that Im getting my html a different way and for whatever reason I cant find the assets Im looking for.

Negative 58299 pIm working on a Java REST server serving an iPhone app. Now we have to integrate with third party service exposed by oauth2 protocol. This is new to me so Ive been reading and writing some proof of concept code but I have a big problem or I fundamentally dont understand something...p  pI made a simple web page with log in with XXX button that the user sees in a web view. When he clicks it, login page of the third party service opens and he can approve my app, at what time they will redirect the user to an URL Ive specified with the authorization code as a parameter. This URL points to a REST service on my server.p  pThe problem is that this URL must be absolutely the same as the one Ive set up when applying my app for their service. Since Im running a REST server I have no way of knowing about which user are we talking about when the redirection to my server happens there is no session. I wanted to do this identification with some query or path param but they are not allowing it.p  pDoes any of this makes sense to you or am I implementing this in a wrong way The only possible solution I can imagine now will be with the help of cookies but Im not really fond of that...p
Negative 58299 pI am working with tables containing strongmillionsstrong of records and often have to run queries for reporting reasons against it which some can take hours depending on the level of joins and what not.

Its all legacy and poorly optimized. Just trying to work with what Ive got.p  pAll the databases are on the same slave server and yes, queries need to be done that are crossdatabase.

However, when it is read emfromem the database, EclipseLink gives me the entity emwith a null primary key fieldem. This is causing a devastating bug in production software.li licodeExperimentBlockcode inherits its primary key field with annotations, a getter, and a setter, from its superclass codePeriodResidentcode. Several other subclasses of codePeriodResidentcode do the same, embut EclipseLink correctly loads their primary keyem. This is the mystery of this bug the exact same fieldgettersetter code is being used for every subclass of codePeriodResidentcode, but codeExperimentBlockcode is the only one that EclipseLink returns with a nulledout primary keyli liRunning a JPQL query that selects codeExpermentBlockcodes returns them with null primary keys.

Negative 58299 pFrom my understanding, codethrowcode is a primative jvm command. When this is called, the JVM checks if the current call stack can catch it. if it cant, then java simply pops the call stack almost exactly as if a return was called. then the jvm checks if the current call stack can catch it and so on recursively.p  pMy question how is it algorithmically possible for the JVM to know where in the call stack can catch a given exception Is there metadata stored in each call stack entry mapping exceptions to code blocks is there a static data structure in the heap that somehow keeps track of this because somewhere there has to be data keeping track of that.p

Ironically, if I set the codealignmentXcode for codepanel1code to codeRIGHTALIGNMENTcode, it actually floats to the left.  But the gap still exists just now on the right.  As I fill codepanel1code with content and increase its size, the gap to its right grows smaller and smaller, but never completely goes away, frustratingly.p  pThis doesnt just happen when codepanel2code is a codeFlowLayoutcode... it also happens with codeJScrollPanecode and many other types... types which dont usually have the codehgapcode parameter, which means the only way to fix the gap to the left of codepanel1code is to change the new containers codeminimumSizecode to 0, which again seems silly and unrelated, and most importantly may not be my design intent.p

Negative 58299 pAs per the singleton design pattern, there can only exist one instance of the Singleton class throughout the application.

Negative 58299 pMy intention is to submit data from a form to the server and not have the page reload.  It does not even need to display updated data.  I am developing using Firefox and Im looking at two paths to get what I wantp  ol liIve discovered that if I place a button inside a form, the form will be submitted with the name of the page containing it as a GET request.  The form tag in this case has not method attribute and the action tag is empty.  I can input the function that I want into the action attribute, and the browser will apply the rest of the form fields to the request.  I find the formulation of the form convenient, but the browser goes ahead and replaces the page with whatever the response is from the server, taking me away from the original page.li liTaking the button out of the form and wiring it exclusivly to a javascript function allows me to register a function to the onreadystatechange event.  This has the effect of running a function rather than reloading the page when the server responds. The down side of this seems to be that it is necessary for the function to formulate the GET request on its own.li ol  pIt seems to me that there should be a way for the javascript function to tell the form to submit using its own devices, and then be ready to process the the response.  Being new at this I am unfamiliar with what Best Practice would be for this requirement.p
Negative 58299 pThis is a follow up problem that I opened up earlier in another thread at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14565538boostdeserializingacustomcobjectpassedoverzeromqpullsocketBoost Deserializing a custom C object passed over ZeroMQ pull socketa. The problem in that thread has been resolved based on the answer provided. Now I have another problem at runtime. Please, see the below description. I am realtively new to C realm so I appreciate if you tell me any necessity for improvement in any part of the code provided in addition to what I descibed under problem statment.p  pstrongDescriptionstrongp  pI have a C class named strongGenericMessagestrong which simply holds an id and data as its members See code snippet 2 below  GenericMessage.hxx. My intention is to serialize an instance of this class and send it via a ZeroMQ socket which implements the push pattern. p  pThe serialization and sending task has been implemented in strongclass ZMQHandlerstrong see sendToBE function which is placed in a header file name ZMQHandler.hxx shown in the strongcode snippet 3strong below. This class is instantiated by strongTestFE.cxxstrong shown in strongthe 4rd code snippetstrong below.p  pThe receiving and deserialization of the GenericMessage instance is implemented in strongTestBE.cxxstrong  available in the strong5th code snippetstrong below. My intention is to receive the GenericMessage instance over the ZMQ socket i.e. pull socket, deserialize it and then print its members to standard output. p  pI verified that seriazalition and the GenericMessage object that is transferred over the ZeroMQ socket works fine. Deserialization seems to work as well cause I dont get any exception or segmentation fault like thing.p  pstrongProblem Statementstrongp  pWhat is expected from the code in TestBE.cxx see code snippet 5 is to receive the GenericMessage object over the ZeroMQ socket deserialize it and then print its two members namely id and data which is a string object in this case. More precisely it should first print the content of the char stream it gets and then the members of the deserialized object. Instead, it does not print these members at all. Al, it puts weird symbols including question marks into the received char stream. Please see the 1st code snippet below, youll see my point.p  pstrongQUESTIONsstrongp  pstrongistrong Why cannot I get the expected output Why do I see the question marked weird symbols in the output Why I dont see the id and data fields printed although they are visible in the printed char streamp  pstrongiistrong The data field in the GenericMessage class is a template type which is set to stdstring for testing purposes. However, in real use, I plan to transfer a much more complex object in a serialized form. In this respect, do you think the use of classes boostarchivetextiarchive and boostarchivetextoarchive is useful. Should I use binary instead If so, is there some pitfallspossible problems that you think I should be aware of Thanks in advance.p  pstrongSNIPPET 1 Program output vs. expected outputstrongp  precode     The EXPECTED OUTPUT      Connecting to FE...

Negative 58299 pBasically I have a class hierarchy something like thisp  precodeNSObject   MySpecialController     MyExtraSpecialController codepre  pEach of these has an codeinitcode method, and each implementation calls codesupercode first to let the superclass initialize itself first, all the way up the chain. For lack of better terminology I would say that each class augments its super class behaviour.p  pBut lets suppose I want to replace my super classs behaviour entirely simply because I want to specialize it further for a particular app, but without cluttering the generic reusable super class. So it is assumed that I have intimate knowledge of the super class. The actual change that I want to do is replace a property with one of a more specific class type. To fully implement this I need the codeinitcode method to instantiate an instance of codewidgetcode of the appropriate class. So if I instantiate a codeMySpecialControllercode, its codewidgetcode property should be of type codeMySpecialWidgetcode but if I instantiate a codeMyExtraSpecialControllercode, its codewidgetcode should be of type codeMyExtraSpecialWidgetcodep  precodeMySpecialController  interface MySpecialController  NSObject  property strong, nonatomic MySpecialWidget widget  end  implementation MySpecialController  idinit      if self  [super init]          self.widget  [MySpecialWidget new]        end   MyExtraSpecialController  interface MyExtraSpecialController  MySpecialController  property strong, nonatomic MyExtraSpecialWidget widget  end  implementation MyExtraSpecialController  idinit      if self  [super init]          self.widget  [MyExtraSpecialWidget new]        end codepre  pNow this works in the sense that codeMySpecialControllercode works, and can be used by anyone with the public API. And codeMyExtraSpecialControllercode also works, and follows proper separation of concerns as it assumed nothing about the superclasss behaviour. This is the type of subclass one would create of a framework or library class robust and unassuming.p  pWhat actually happens though is that when I create a new instance of codeMyExtraSpecialControllercode, its superclass first instantiates a codeMySpecialWidgetcode, and then it immediately deallocates that instance and replaces it with an instance of codeMyExtraSpecialWidgetcode. Sure this works, but since I DO have intimate knowledge of the superclass which basically means that I know exactly what its codeinitcode method does, so I can safely replace it without needing to call it first, I want to avoid this problem and only instantiate a single widget it just so happens that creating a widget is really expensive and isnt premature optimization. So I want to replace supers implementation entirely so that it doesnt create a widget, and will replace everything else that it does based on my intimate knowledge, but, and this is key, I still want to call codeinitcode further up the chain because I dont know what my replaced class superclass codeinitcode method does codeNSObjectcode in this case, as this is a class I dont have intimate knowledge of.p  pThe immediate solution that comes to mind is to use the ObjectiveC dynamic runtime to get hold of the grandparent instance, and just call its codeinitcode which will then take care of calling up the chain if it needs to, therewith bypassing super.

Negative 58299 pHy What i want to do is to create a custom renderer for willpaginate which renders first, previous, next and last page and a input field where the user can type in the page number manually. I already have the links for first, last etc. but i stuck at the input field. I could create a form in the view but the input field has to be rendered between the previous and next links. Does anyone know how to do thisp  pThanks for your helpp
Negative 58299 pBasically, I have a large hyperlink element, with a background image. When the user hovers over it, I expose an edit button for them to click that pops up an input form for them to edit some stuff about the hyperlink.p  pFor example, take photo albums. I display all of the users photo albums with their cover photo and their name. Upon clicking the photo album, the user is relocated to another page with all of that albums contents. However, when they hover over the photo, this exposes an edit button above the bottomright corner of the album. When they click this button, that exposes an edit form for them to edit the title of the album. p  pHowever, when they click the exposed edit button, this activates the link as well and they are transferred to the contents of that photo album. It does expose the edit form, but it doesnt matter since the page automatically transfers them to a different view.p  pHow do I solve this Are all child nodes of a hyperlink node also hyperlinked And if so, how could I disable the hyperlinking mechanism for just that one edit buttonp

Negative 58299 pSo due to the quality issues of just getting the data from the android.media.action.IMAGECAPTURE, I apparently needed to call the activity, save a local temporary file that I can then create a Bitmap from. This Bitmap will be cropped into a square, set to an ImageView, then stored locally However, Im having some problems. Everything excluding the cropping for now works up to setting the image it returns a blank image and storing it internally, at which point it crashes. I attempt to find the file on the SD card with a file manager but the folder doesnt even show up, So I dont know if the file is even really being created.

Negative 58299 pOK, Bare with me here as this is some what new to me. I have a Webservice setup to reach out to my database and when called upon by a SWF, it returns an XML to populate a Datagrid. It is all working with one exception. Should I not have any data in the table to return, I get an 1088 error stating that the XML is NULL.p  pWhat I would like to happen is that the Datagrid would just display an empty grid until there is data to populate it and not receive the error message. This is a display only board like a flight status display at an airport, so there is no user interaction to reset the error messages. p  pI am using PHP with MySQL and Builder 4.6 if this matters.p  pThanksp

Negative 58299 pHi I have designed a File Explorer which I use to show some XML files and depending on the selected one I open one XML or another. Until the moment there is no problem at all and with the help of XMLPullParser I insert the text from the attributes into some ArrayLists.

Negative 58299 pFrequently, wav files are or need to be 24bit yet I do not see a way to write or read 24bit wav files using scipy module. The documentation for wavfile.write states that the resolution of the wav file is determined by the data type. That must mean 24bit is not supported since I do not know of a 24bit integer data type. If an alternative is necessary it would be nice if it were common so that files can be easily exchanged without the need for others with scipy to install additional module. p  precodeimport numpy as np import scipy.io.wavfile as wavfile  fs48000 t1 nc2 nbits24 x  np.random.randtfs,nc  2  1 wavfile.writewhite.wav, fs, x2nbits11.astypenp.int32 codepre

Negative 58299 pI know this question has been asked many times and many would just press report button before reading this, but the reason why I created another question for the same question is thatp  pI readed around 20 stackoverflow pages about this topic and readed all or almost all the links they linked to and all of them mentioned either a Third Party Plugin or the following methodp  blockquote   p10 digit numbercarrierp blockquote  pso for example it could bep  blockquote   p3855550168vtext.comp blockquote  pbut I tried using that method with my cellphone and carrier, but it didnt work.p  pSo my question would be how to achieve such task or If the method mentioned above works, what am I doing wrongp

Like sop  precodeltphp echo thisgtFormgtpostLink     Delete,     arrayaction gt delete, location[Location][id],     arrayclass gt btn btnsmall btnprimary,     arrayconfirm gt Are you sure gt codepre  pI also tried adding the class array after the confirm array, and before the action array but to no avail. This is the error I getp  blockquote   pNotice 8 Array to string conversion [CORECakeViewHelperFormHelper.php, line 1786]p blockquote  pThat line readsp  precodeoptions[onclick] ifconfirmconfirmMessage  onClick  codepre  pSo when I put the class array after the action it lets the class be applied to the button but throws the above error. If I put it before the action the class is not applied and I still get the error. I dont know what the problem is but I have scoured the internet and docs for an answer but have found nothing even close...p

I have implemented that using the Visual State Manager by assigning a new codeltControlTemplate TargetTypeSelectorItemgtcode in the style, which handles the codeSelectedcode and codeSelectedUnfocusedcode states.

There is an if statement for each coordinate, so there are 40 different if statements, each with an image of the map. The problem is that nothing happens after the player is asked for a coordinate. The program ends after asking for a coordinate, but does not give any error and I know Im inputting a correct coordinate.p  precodemove  inputn To move around the room Hero, simply think the coordinates of the tile        you want to move to However, you can only move one tile at a time Ex You are at tile 5,4.

Although I have been successful with some basic reports that I can run from within SharePoint site by connecting to rally with the read key, I cannot do so for more complex reports that I want to run. It is simply not working from within SharePoint as Dojo is not found when it looks for it. I replaced the relative URLs with absolute and now server response from rally says that it looks for slm.....i.e. relative URL and not the absolute URL. I dont know much about how Dojo library works but is there an easier way I can make the rally release dashboard show up when I add the code in SharePoint web part.

Negative 58299 pI get mixed answer whenever I look for concurrent access , JCIP book I have already ordered and is on the way  , but I want to nail this concurrency basics of mine , here is my scenariop  pI have 3 threads. One thread is responsible for establishing a connection and creates a singleton connection object instance.The other two threads will be sending data incessantly.p  pNow the other threads will wait on a codeCountDownLatchcode which will be counted down to zero by the connection thread once the connection has been established.p  pHere is what I have declared in the codeConnectStatuscode class in hope of codeconnectedcode variable being strongsynchronized and visible to all the threads.strongp  precodepublic class ConnectStatus   public static final CountDownLatch connectionLatch  new CountDownLatch1 private static volatile AtomicBoolean connected   codepre  pI am using this codeconnectedcode variable which is volatile amp atomic to maintain the connection status.

Negative 58299 pIve been tasked with implementing SSO across a number of our sites and have a number of questions regarding best practice, etc.p  pThe main .NET site has an existing user table with thousands of registered users which should be able to log in to a number of other sister websites, some of which might be built using PHP. From looking at the examples, it seems this would be the OpenIdWebRingSsoProvider and the other sites would implement the OpenIdWebRingSsoRelyingParty code. Is this correctp  pOne other question I have is if a user logs in to the main site using Facebook for example, then decides to log in to one of the sister sites using Google, how would the system know this should be the same user.

Negative 58299 pI am finishing a program that translates a higherorder language to another and I am having trouble dealing with the interface I am trying to implement.  p  pThe idea is that it asks the user for a number to be chosen, then checks whether it is a number, if it is, it follows with a line asking to write the given term to be translated.  p  pIf the number is 4, it has an additional line asking for the term to be substituted, thus the translating function takes 2 args instead of 1.

Negative 58299 pIve just taken a Facebook app live ie its a web app that lives at apps.facebook.com. The app is a simple form that allows you to vote for one of four options.

It even has exception handling in the edge cases where the user is not FB authenticated etc.p  pThe issue we have encountered is that when a user visits the app from within the iOS Facebook app, the link opens within the Facebook in app browser based on the iOS UIWebView component I believe. When using it from this environment, when the form submits our server is producing a 500 error.p  pNow I know that the 500 error will be nothing to do with facebook since it is our application code, but my confusion arises from the fact that this only happens from the Facebook in app browser.

Negative 58299 pAnalyzing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq205682351468366this questiona I found out some things about behavior of weak symbol resolution in the context of dynamic loading codedlopencode on Linux. Now Im looking for the specifications governing this.p  pLets take a hrefhttpsgist.github.comgagern7989748an examplea. Suppose there is a program codeacode which dynamically loads libraries codeb.socode and codec.socode, in that order. If codec.socode depends on two other libraries codefoo.socode actually codelibgcc.socode in that example and codebar.socode actually codelibpthread.socode, then usually symbols exported by codebar.socode can be used to satisfy weak symbol linkages in codefoo.socode. But if codeb.socode also depends on codefoo.socode but not on codebar.socode, then these weak symbols will apparently not be linked against codebar.socode. It seems as if codefoo.socode inkages only look for symbols from codeacode and codeb.socode and all their dependencies.p  pThis makes sense, to some degree, since otherwise loading codec.socode might change the behavior of codefoo.socode at some point where codeb.socode has already been using the library. On the other hand, in the question that got me started this caused quite a bit of trouble, so I wonder whether there is a way around this problem. And in order to find ways around, I first need a good understanding about the very exact details how symbol resolution in these cases is specified.p  pstrongWhat is the specification or other technical document to define correct behavior in these scenariosstrongp

In this project object I need to call a method in a strongemViewControlleremstrong. p  pThe method I need to call draws some objects in the strongemViewControlleremstrong principal view using a modified  p  pcodevoiddrawRectCGRectrectcode method. p  pThe only thing I need to do is call this method on the actual instance the instance that is created when the app starts of the strongemViewControlleremstrong from a method in the project class.p  pThe method created to draw the objects works. I tested it by calling it from the codeViewDidLoadcode method of the emViewControllerem. In the project method I tried for example this codep  precodevoiddrawProject    UIStoryboard mainStoryboard [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMain bundlenil]   IYViewController projectViewController  [[IYViewController alloc] init]   projectViewController  IYViewController [mainStoryboard         instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierproject]   [projectViewController drawProject]  codepre  pI named the principal, the target strongemViewControlleremstrong project in interface builder. p  pThe problem is that anyway the strongemViewControlleremstrong instance that I create is not the instance of strongemIYViewControlleremstrong that is displayed at runtime. p  pI didnt find any real good solution that works for me, so please help Maybe the solution is create a delegate of a class but I didnt really understand that so please if this is the right solution help me code itp

Negative 58299 pIm always eager to learn about the most extreme performance optimizations out there. Recently, ive been thinking alot about exploiting large registers. I feel guilty when ive got a one bit information sitting in a 64 bit register ... So id like to know tricks how I can do stuff like compare multiple 16 bits at once e.g. Usefull when there is high probability none would match or such. Ofc the most easiest example to check for whether atleast one element got a flag set is to xor a 0 register with those 64 bits and compare it for  0. on the instruction level this ofc would exploit instr. Pipeline but anyways youre down to 2 instructions instead of 128 each mov and cmp. Thats what I would call a whopping speedup p  pOfc Im aware that cache misses are what our cpus spend 95 of its time on, but lets assume the cache use would already be optimal.p  pEspecially with trees, it would be usefull to compare multiple values without SIMD at once and get out a single childIndex to read next. In the end the instructions should be minimized and dont suffer too much from pipeline wait penaltys.p  pOther operations I could list upp  pWhen put next to eachother with padding, e.g. 5x11 bits you do 5 additions, shifts, subtractions and bitwise operations in parallel. Or 7x 8bits. Ofc, one would need to store the data in that way and use the result efficiently to not pay a penalty on bitmask extractionimport.p
Negative 58299 pSorry for the length of the post. I want to illustrate what I have tried and what I am trying to accomplish.p  pEssentially what I am trying to do is write a VOIP network tester in C. Ive written all the VOIP code using the Ozeki VOIP SIP C SDK. Essentially what it does is the client makes a VOIP call which the server side picks up. The client plays a WAV file and the server side records it. Ive generated a tone file from audiocheck.net. I generated a 3000Hz wav file with a sine waveform for 5 seconds at a sample rate of 8000Hz and 16bit. This is what the client plays. I chose the frequency arbitrarily, so that can always change. What I want to do is then have the server side to do a simple analysis on the file to determine the amount of noise, which can be introduced through packet loss, latency, etc.p  pAudioProcessor.cs is a C class that opens a WAV file and reads the header information. Since the file is a 16bit wave, I use a two complement thanks to a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles19590WAVEFileProcessorinC relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles19590WAVEFileProcessorinCa to read each 2byte frame in to an array.

Each of the same size, being 287025. p  precodedataDF  sample.joinadditionalinfo codepre  pThe indices are identical, and the dataDF has the correct size, being 287025. However now I seem to have no access to the rows. I try codedataDF[19]code and it simply outputs a summary of the df, showing all columns I would expect. I also try codedataDF.head3code to show first 3 rows and once again it outputs the summary info for the dataDF.p  pAm not sure why this join seems to be working, yet alas no rows can be seen  I cannot slice the DF.p  pAny ideas as to whyp  pBtw I do not join on the key, as I only want to really join on index.p

Negative 58299 pi was previously building my website on windows with xampp etc... however due to some software issues i had to change to linux and am now running ubuntu 13.10.p  pI reinstalled xampp onto ubuntu and transfered and setup my website on it for me to carry on work, everything seems to work fine apart from one section of the website which is this line of code.p  precodeiv  mcryptcreateiv128, MCRYPTDEVURANDOM codepre  pThis code worked fine on windows and created the random string for me to create the cookie, however on the new ubuntu setup it is failing to work and just exits to the current page im on with no error messages.p  pI changed it to a random string like belowp  precodeiv  aahd98a8du98sd9a8ud9ajsd89 codepre  pAnd the code ran fine, so it must be the mcrypt failing to run. Any ideas on why this may be happeningp  pThanks p

Negative 58299 pI am working in Qt 4.7, and I have a QWidget object in my dialog. I need to go through each of the children and extract the current text into a QStringList. Every other object is a QCheckBox, and the rest are QComboBoxes I would just need the text portion of both. So far the only way I could think of to do this would be to use the children function to get them as QObjects and cast them, like thisp  precodeQStringList textlist forint i  0 i lt uigtmyWidgetgtchildren.size i      ifi  2  0              QCheckBox q  QCheckBox uigtmyWidgetgtchildren.ati         textlist.appendqgttext          else              QComboBox q  QComboBox uigtmyWidgetgtchildren.ati         textlist.appendqgtcurrentText       codepre  pHowever, when I try to use this, it builds and compiles fine, but then crashes when its run. I checked and both classes are subclasses albeit indirectly through QAbstractButton and QWidget of QObject, which is the type of the objects in the list uimyWidgetchildren, so I feel like they should be able to cast this way. I havent worked much with this kind of thing before so Im not sure if theres a better way to do this. If anyone has any ideas, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pUPDATE So, I cant get the casting to work this way or with the qobjectcast. I HAVE however discovered that I can go from QObject to QWidget, and I think I should be able to go from QWidget to the needed objects with dynamiccast, but that doesnt work either. Right now I have thisp  precodeQStringList textlist forint i  0 i lt uigtmyWidgetgtchildren.size i      QWidget qw  qobjectcastltQWidgetgtuigtmyWidgetgtchildren.ati     ifi  2  0              QComboBox q  dynamiccastltQComboBoxgtqw         ifq                      textlist.appendqgttext                   else              QCheckBox q  dynamiccastltQCheckBoxgtqw         ifq                      textlist.appendqgtcurrentText                codepre  pIf anyone has any ideas, Id appreciate the help. Thank you.p  pUPDATE2 I havent found much online that helps with this still, so I may as well ask as well, if there is anyway to do this WITHOUT casting, i.e. getting the objects directly from the QWidget in their original type, I would really appreciate that as well. Im not heartset on my current strategy or anything, it was just the only way I could think to do it  Ill take anything that works at this point.p

Negative 58299 pI am working hard to populate an ExtJS data grid in my Wordpress plugin. I am totally new to web programming so the following may be a stupid question.p  pI managed to write a PHP script that delivers a webpage with embedded Java Sript code that creates a ExtJS data grid in the front side and sucessfully queries data using a ExtJS proxy, model and data store. That json proxy calls a separate getdata.php script by its URL that queries the database, converts the retrieved data to json format and returns them by echo. This works.p  pNow I intended to add some debugging code to the getdata.php script. Unfortunately when using codeif WPDEBUG code I get an error telling me codeUse of undefined constant WPDEBUGcode which I found out by debugging the network access since the database script is called by the proxy and does not produce visible output. In other scripts I can use the WPDEBUG symbol without problems.p  pAny idea why my getdata.php doesnt know WPDEBUG while other scripts of the plugin dop  pUPDATE Seems all the Wordpress smybols are unknown in the getdata.php.p  pUPDATE2 AJAX scripts need to be called using special WordPress methods. See my answer below.p

Negative 58299 pIve been struggling with this now for several hours and Im not getting anywhere. This is a simplified version of the code Im working withp  pI have a module called setup that internally reads files from the filesystem, and does some stuff.

Test 2 fails with AssertionError returned value is the fakedata from the stubp  pThe log messages show that it has printed the data from the file rather than the fakedata. When I inspect the this.sandbox.loader function in the debugger it is correctly set to the stub. p  pThe second issue is that I had to fake out the require and pass in the loader function withp  prequire  function   return loader ,p  pOtherwise require couldnt find the .loader. I tried to change directory with process.chdir before the test, but the require still failed even when the cwd was correctly set to the project directory. Obviously faking out require would only work if there is 1 module required, in the real code there are several requires. The only other way I got the .loader to load was to modify the code to use an absolute path, and editing the code each time to run the test isnt feasible.p  pIve probably missed something obvious, writing unit tests for module code that loads data asynchronously must be pretty standard stuff. Is sandboxstubbing the right approachp  pAny help much appreciated.p

Negative 58299 pIm trying to use something other than latitude and longitude for the Google staticmap center location. I would prefer pixel or tile coordinates. After reading the docs, it does not appear they support anything other than lat amp lng.p  pWhat I am trying to do is display a series of static maps placed next to each other. I have everything working. However, using the longitude to offset the next staticmap in the sequences seems to offset it in the lat by a little bit. Meaning, if I only update the lng value it appears to shift in the lat as well.p  pIn some cases, the image will not offset until a substantial change has been made to the lng.p  h2Example Codeh2  precodevar lat  40.714728 var lng  73.998688 var size  640  forvar i  0 i lt 2 i    var addressLatLng  lat,lng    var googletile  httpmaps.google.commapsapistaticmapsensorfalseampcenteraddressLatLngampzoom20ampsizesizexsizeampmaptypesatellite    lng  0.0005  Does not shift updown if using 0.0001 but also creates repeated visual data... needs a seamless transition from one tile to the next.  codepre  pIs there a better approach for what I am trying to dop
Negative 58299 pIve been at it for a while and its driving me crazy. Heres my problem... I have a codeMenucode and it uses the default template in which Ive altered colors upon highlighting, default state, etc.  So, theres no point posting it here  its virtually exact same thing  and its a lot of template code.p  pWhat my problem is the spacing between the codeMenuItemscode created by the templates codeMargincodeproperty.  It is templatebinded with the padding property and produces a code2, 3, 2, 3code margin all around the codeContentPresentercode of the template.  p  pI want to keep that property and need it to separate the items however, mousing over only activates highlighted state when the mouse is over the codeContentPresentercode and nothing else.  So, the button feel wont actuate until I mouse over the words themselves.  codeContentPresentercode does not have padding, so Im not sure how to deal with it.  I tried editing the triggers that came with the template to work on other parts, but it doesnt work they dont fire off.p  pThe triggers that come with the template only work with the codeContentPresentercode.  I tried wrapping it in codeContentControlcode to see if I can gain codePaddingcode, but the binding for codePaddingcode doesnt work, only for margin... not sure why it shows up in the Properties, but the addition of padding is not visiblep  precodeltContentControl SnapsToDevicePixelsTemplateBinding SnapsToDevicePixels                  PaddingTemplateBinding Paddinggt     ltContentPresenter ContentSourceHeader RecognizesAccessKeyTruegt ltContentControlgt codepre  pI also tried replacing codeContentPresentercode with codeContentControlcode altogether, but once again suffered from Padding not binding properly and manual Padding didnt do anything either.  Something is overwriting it, perhaps.p  pAny idea how I can actuate triggers in the empty space between those codeMenuItemscode  The way Ive been dealing with it is by adding whitespace into my codeMenuItemcode headers... and thats just absurd.p  pHeres my templatep  precodeltLinearGradientBrush xKeyMenuItemSelectionFill EndPoint0,1 StartPoint0,0gt     ltGradientStop Color34C5EBFF Offset0gt

Negative 58299 pIm new to AngularJs, so this might be very obvious, but Im trying to figure out how to show or hide an element in my navbar based on the route, or the current view being displayed.  So, for example, I have an basicadvanced toggle button that I put in the navbar bootstrap 3 when the user is on the search form.  But when they are anywhere else in the app that toggle button should be hidden.  In terms of the DOM, its just an li in the ul that builds out the nav.

For example, We have model Car and model Color. John has red color and Mike has yellow color. John assign red to the car, but when Mike gets in to change the name, he cannot keep the red color, so he needs to assign None or yellow. My solution is to add to the query set those values already assigned to those Cars where Mike has access, so even if red color is not Mikes, he will see it because he has access to a red car. As I cannot get the id of the object when making the filter, I cannot get the unique value needed, getting too many values.li ul  pReplies from everybody are welcomed. Thanks.p

The core problem, AFAICS, had nothing to do with the string type being immutable.  As I see It the best answer comes from Khanh TO. The event listeners were not initialized when the controller was created in the first place. This was fixed with a bootstrapping angular.module.run. Also the controller was reinitialized every time the stateview was loaded causing the variable prevState to be reinitialized, thus the listener functions and the goBack function used different outer prevState variables. Storing the prevState on the rootScope solved this problem.p

So what I simply did is wrap the gridview inside an update panel.  I then place a timer within this update panel and set it to 10000 10 seconds for the tick event.  I set the event OnTick as shownp  precode   protected void TimerChecklistsTickobject sender, EventArgs e                      LoadChecklistsSubPanel             timerChecklists.Enabled  false             imgLoader.Visible  false          codepre  pThe LoadChecklistsSubPanel simply gets a dataset and assigns it to the grid views datasource and does a databind.  This all works fine...however my issue is the followingp  pNote as mentioned a parent update panel and a child update panel.  Within this I have an Update progress associated to the update panel upParent.  But my issue is when the 10 seconds hits and the timer event is fired this updateprogress is shown in effect causing my entire page to basically load.  I would think that this would not happen given the updatemode is condition and children as triggers is false.p  pI have also tried ChildrenAsTriggerstrue, Ive tried to make the update panel mode always, Ive tried just about everything but my issue still persists.  Right when 10 seconds hits the UpdateProgress which shows a loading data, please wait overlay is displayed.p  pOther than that my grid view is getting binded correctly, its getting its data after 10 seconds, etc.  My only issue is I cannot seem to understand why the UpdateProgress shows up and overlays my entire screen if all that is happening is my nested sub panel should be updating only.p

Negative 58299 pI have a BLE thermometer and Id like to record the data from it as the monitoring application available for both Android and iOS that comes with it doesnt do it, it merely displays the data on the screen for a limited time.p  pI tried all BLE apps on both Android I have a Nexus5 with Android 4.4 and iOS 7.1 iPad with but, while some discovered the device, none of them could display any data because all try to emconnectem to the sensor whereas the sensor returns 0 for codekCBAdvDataIsConnectablecode.p  pIs this possible It must be because its own app does it, but Im not too familiar with BLE and I may be missing something. I was surprised that none of the apps in the AppPlay store had the feature of listening what a device sends without connecting. But then again, Im not very familiar with BLE. p  pA few pointers are appreciated.p

Negative 58299 pI have a problem with WooCommerce and filtering by multiple attributes at a time using the Layered Nav widgets. I know there are a couple of other plugins offering ajax filtering, but the documentation for them doesnt seem to suggest they will work out this problem, and the WC docs offer nothing on this issue. I cant tell if Im missing something obvious here, because i imagine EVERY site that uses filters wants them to work in the way I outline below, not as they work currently.p  pMy site uses three attributes  Colour  Clothing type  Brandp  pI have setup 3 instances of the Layered Nav widget in the sidebar to allow customers to find what they want. For all 3 I am using the query type of OR, so that if a customer enables the Blue and Green and Red filter options, they can see any product that is either Blue OR Green OR Red. Similarly for Brand and clothing type.p  pWhere I get stuck is that these widgets dont seem to have an option to specify AND or OR between attributes. I would expect the following logic when I use a clothing filter on a websitep  pColor green OR blue AND Brand Nike OR Adidas AND Type Accessories OR Tops OR Bottomsp  pbut instead everything is just one long OR query so a piece of clothing could be blue OR an accessory OR nike OR green OR adidas.p  pThe result is that customers get lots of products they dont want to see i.e. a Puma product shows up because its Blue, even if the brand filter only wants Nike or Adidas.p  pIs there any way to chain queries together so that WITHIN an attribute we use OR, but across attributes we use AND I imagine the SQL query for this wouldnt be too complex, Im just hoping theres an extension that would handle this for me.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 58299 pMy program conforms to the strict aliasing rule, except for one place a compilation unit which contains hashing functions such as MurmurHash3, SpookyHash, etc. On x86 and x8664, these hashing functions accept a codeconst char code, cast them to codeuint32code, and process data in blocks of 4 bytes. This makes them much faster compared to processing data bytebybyte, but I believe this breaks the strict aliasing rule. Right now, I compile this compilation unit with fnostrictaliasing, while I compile the rest of the program with fstrictaliasing.p  pBut Im wondering what happens if I enable linktime optimization. As far as I know, GCC and Clang implement linktime optimization sortof by storing the program source into .o files, so that at the linking phase the compiler knows the source code of the entire program. Is it then still possible to disable strict aliasing for the hashing functions only Or do I now have to disable strict aliasing for the entire program Or did I misunderstand things completely, and MurmurHash3SpookyHash are in fact strict aliasing compliantp

Negative 58299 pI wonder if anyone could help me with some questions on Jenkins. We are using Jenkins for both .Net frontend and J2EE backend projects.p  ul lipWhen using Jenkins to build a .Net project, what would be the step to package the whole project with all the dependencies after build for deployment I did all the setup with Nuget to grab dependencies and the build is success but Im still confused about packaging. Im not sure if I should use Archive the artifacts in Add Post Build step or should I use Command Line Arguments under MSBuild. From my understanding, by using Archive the artifacts in Add Post Build step we can archive the whole package as a zip file for .Net project or .war.jar file for Java project. If this is the case, what should I put in Files to archive fieldpli lipOn the other hand, when using MSBuild I put in these lines under Command Line Argumentsp  ppConfigurationRelease  pDeployTargetPackage  pCreatePackageOnPublishTrue  pDeployIisAppPathCProject pPackageLocationCProjectSolutionFile.zip pIntermediateOutputPathCProjectTemppli ul  pWhen looking at the output, it gives me a PackageTmp folder with contents that I want for the project. However, outside of PackageTmp folder is a Package folder with .cmd, .txt, and two of .xml files. May I ask if these files are used for deployment with MSDeploy.exe Beside that, outside of Package folder is another folder with lot of .dll, .pdb, and .cache files. May I ask what are these files for and do I need them The MSBuild also creates a TransformWebConfig folder, I dont know what is this folder for. I come from Java background and Im not familiar with .Net stack. Im also not sure if the Command Line Arguments I used for MSBuild are correct.p  pOn the other hand, we use NetBean with our Java project. My understanding is NetBean uses Ant to manage the dependencies. Should we switch to Maven to manage dependencies under Jenkins What would be the ProsCons of using Ant or Maven especially under Jenkins I apologize for asking many questions.

It reaches the NSLog line in the else statement where it is supposed to display the object ID. This displays the correct object id for the object that I am trying to receive. Now heres the weird part. The code seems to stop there. Nothing happens when trying to save the properties title, description, lat, long to the respective NSStrings none of those other NSLogs below that are executed. But the weird thing is that there are no errors and the app keeps running as if that code below the first NSLog wasnt even there. Any insight into why this isnt working.p

Negative 58299 pI am trying to setup 2 separate Contributorrole user group for 2 separate Resource Groups in Microsoft Azure. In the new portal, I added 2 groups in the Contributor role. So after I created a new Azure website and its resource group, the 2 contributor user groups are automatically accessible to the new resource group, however, I want to only allow one group to be able to access that resource. I went in to the Resource Group blade and select the User group I dont want it to access, however, the Remove button is disabled. So how can I remove the User groupp  pAnd also I realized that a member of the User Group is not able to see the resource assigned but if that member is added explicitly as a userwithout a group, the user is then able to access the resource group. So my question is, is the Resource Group not supported for user group yet In my case, should I create 2 separate active directory for the 2 different user groupsp

Negative 58299 pstrongBackgroundstrong I have a database containing emparentsem and emchildrens namesem this is a simplification of the actual data, but the analogy is close enough.p  pstrongTaskstrong The database has to store an emordered listem of emchildrens namesem for each emparentem.p  pstrongAssumptionsstrongp  ol liThe database will contain millions of parents, possibly more.li liParents typically have no more than to 4 or 5 children, but rare and even extreme cases have to be supported as well.li liChildrens names as well as the ordering tends to repeat a lot. So parents should reference some codechildrennameslistidcode instead of keeping a copy of the actual names.li liChildrens names as well as their ordering for a particular parent are immutable.li liInsertion of new parents will be very frequent. When a new parent is inserted with a list of his children, if such a list of names already exists in the database, the new parent should reference the existing list identifier.li liQueries about names and their ordering should be possible for example  emfind all parents that names a child Bob after naming a child Aliceem, or emfind all parents that named a child Alice, then had two more children, with the third named Carolem etcli ol  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liWhats the best way to store such lists The solution should be robust and support fast parent insertions.li liHow should a parent reference the listsli ol  pstrongCurrent proposed solutionstrongp  pMy current approach is to have a table that maps emchildren namesem to eminteger name idsem names are long, integers are short. Then store name lists in the following tuples codeltlistidgt ltordergt ltnameidgtcode so the list table will look like thisp  precodeltlistidgt ltordergt ltnameidgt     1       1       123     1       2       345     1       3       678     2       1       901     3       1       123     3       1       901 codepre  pThe example table contains three lists [123,345,678], [901], [123,901] which might correspond to something like [Alice, Bob, Carol], [Dave], [Alice, Dave] The parents table will then have a codechildrenlistidcode column that references the codelistidcode column.p  pThis solution seems to be robust, except for two issuesp  ol liIm not sure whether insertions will be fast enough looking up whether an existing list already exists seems like it could be slow, but other approaches seem to be less robust or much harder to query.li liThe key to the name list table is composed of both the codelistidcode and the codeordercode columns the parents table has to reference only the codelistidcode which should be a foreign key, but since codelistidcode isnt a key by itself in the list table, an additional table of lists, in which codelistidcode is key is needed. This seems cumbersome. li ol  pstrongAlternate solutionstrongp  pThe table of lists will store implicit ordering in the columnsp  precodeltlistidgt ltname1gt ltname2gt ltname3gt ltname4gt ... ltname100gt     1        111     222     333      null     2        444     null     3        555     111     null codepre  pIn this table, codelistidcode will be the primary key.p  pThe parents table will keep the codelistidcode as a foreign key.p  pThis solution is somewhat less robust how many columns do I create 10 20 50, but makes insertions much quicker. And since the codelistidcode is a key, no additional tables are needed. A possible downside however is that some queries become much more complicated since they have to reference multiple columns.p  pThanksp

Negative 58299 pThis is perhaps a too general question, still it bothers me. In general, whats a better practice and why proxying or subclassing a base class By strongbasestrong I mean one of the standard classes, which usually not even implemented in Python.p  pA more concrete question is as follows I wish to create an object for graph edges a graph edge is essentially a pair of two vertices. A vertex can be any hashable object. I wish that an edge will expose many more methods than a codefrozensetcode exposes. So I wonder whether I shouldp  precodeclass Edgefrozenset     def mymethodself, args         return 3 codepre  porp  precodeclass Edgeobject     def initself, args         self.frozenset  frozensetargs      def lenself         return lenself.frozenset      def ... codepre  pThe benefits of the first method is that I have to write less since I dont have to duplicate all the original methods. The second method looks, however, safer in some sense. It is also more flexible, as it allows me to avoid some methods which codefrozensetcode exposes such as codedifferencecode, if I wish.p  pThe first method also introduces an issue with the number of arguments passed. I probably have to overwrite codefrozenset.newcode, if I wish to control that. On the other hand, the first method will probably be faster in general, since the proxying creates some overhead.p  pI dont know if it matters, but I usually write for Python 2.7.p

Negative 58299 pI am trying to connect my app to Microsoft SQL server 2008 R2 and retrieve data from it. I can connect my app to MySql through out php but cant complete the same task in terms of MSSQL server. I have googled a hrefhttpamitku.wordpress.com20110803howtoconnectandaccesssqldatabaseserverfromandroidapp relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25461125androidapplicationnotconnectingtomssqlserver2008thisa links. But these links dont tell me exactly the procedure that I should follow. Here in a hrefhttpwww.basic4ppc.comandroidforumthreadsconnectandroidtomssqlservertutorial.13166 relnofollowthisa link I found something that tells me to work with asp. But I cant cope the code. As a new one to do so, can anyone please tell me step by step procedure about connecting android app to MSSQL server Need the solution pretty badly.  On the other hand, some of the comments and answer tells me that I should use web service. How should I implement web service in my code. I can retrieve data from MySql source through json parsing via PHP code. Should I use, ASP instead of PHP. Then how should I do it What I have done as a novice is as below.p  pTried out connecting the server directly.p  precodepublic void query          Log.eAndroid, SQL Connect Example.

Negative 58299 pI have created a web page that is compatible on mobile devices. The page contains a bunch of items that I would like to call Cards. So basically what I need was able to flip to the cards by scrolling up and down. So far I have used the script below to do the scroll.p  precodehtml, body.animate     scrollTop id.children.childrenrespondBtn.offset.top , 200, swing codepre  pWhen I checked it using my web browser on PC, the scroll is working as expected.. I have some listeners that will check for the next item and will automatically scroll when found.p  pNow the issue is that, on mobile, using the scroll feature, there are times that I may have scrolled past the next element, and then what will happen is that it will bounce back to that element. What I need to do is to stop to the next card and not be able to scroll past the next item.p  pI have accepted an answer.. but please I am very much open to suggestions Thanks p

Negative 58299 pI am building a port scanner for Android and am trying out different methods for host discovery. I tried out multithreading ICMP echo requests and found it to be inaccurate since a good amount of newer operating systems block ICMP echo requests by default. I moved on to implementing a mDNS solution and found that to be more accurate but much slower.p  pWhat I have settled on for now is reading the ARP table procnetarp after it has been populated by parsing the data and looking for IP addresses that have a nonzeroed MAC address. I am filling up the ARP table by multithreading a bunch of calls to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavanetInetAddress.htmlisReachableint relnofollowisReachablea. I found that I am able to get away with a 1ms timeout in the call to isReachable since I am only using it to fill the ARP table and not actually connect to a host. This has allowed my host discovery to only take a few seconds.p  pAccuracy and speed are equally as important to me in this process so my question is how stable of a solution is this Do all Android devices have their ARP table in the same location Are there any caveats I need to watch out forp

Negative 58299 pI am creating a application that tracks time. A user inputs his or her user ID and clicks clock in. The application allows for multiple users to be logged in at the same time. I want to clock all users out when they exit the application and insert user ID, username and Time Out for each user that is clocked in into my database. Clocking all users out when the application is close will hopefully provide better time reporting if a user forgets to clock out. My question is how would this be accomplished, would I use arrays or is using a list better for this problem p  pThanksp

Negative 58299 pWe use Xamarin for our AndroidiOS application and the Xamarin.Mobile Geolocator to track the users position. It works pretty good but there is one problem in the android application  There are position leaps when the position is provided not by the GPS, but by the WiFi provider. This leaps falsify the distance calculation and we struggle how to filter them out. The deviation of distance is heavy, the leaps can double the distance when running in an suburban area for lets say about one hour.p  pThe accuracy of the WIFI position is always between 30 and 50 meters. In reality, the positions are always a few hundred meters away. Simply filter the positions by 30m would be an option, but then we also miss the early GPS locations, before the GPS has been initialised properly.p  pIn pure android, we could simply just listen to the GPS provider, but this seems not to be an option for the Xamarin Geolocator. And because this is shared code between iOS and Android, it would be a pity if we need to reimplement this part of code with the native LocationManager p  pThx for any good inputsp

Negative 58299 pIm trying to work out the best practices for using ReactiveUI amp UICollectionViews and associated cells.p  pIm got a solution working, but it isnt clear to me anyway the best place to put the view model setup in the cell.p  pOn non iOS platforms Ive typically used the this.WhenActivated and I do use this to setup the view, but what I have noticed however is that this is only really called a few times due to the way in which the UICollectionView reuses cells. I have similarly added an Disable.Createlt to see when the cell is deactivated but this is never invoked as the collection view is scrolled but prepare for reuse is being called.p  pSo.... the questions arep  ol liIs this the expected behaviourli liIf so, do we instead rely on the ViewModel being changed as a trigger to change the content li liIs this.WhenActivated still the best way of performing the initial setup of the ViewModel bindingli ol  pThanksp

I have debugged this and found out that if I am trying to send a notification to a phone that has the Play Store version from a phone that has a debug version, the data sends but the phone with the debug version of the app does not receive the notification.

I know how to do this using codefopencode and codefprintfcode, but I would like to avoid that, and, if possible avoid unnecessary closing use some sort of rewind.p

Negative 58299 pIs it possible to create a regex to match two sets with equal length For example I would like to match codeaabbcode and codeaaaabbbbcode but not codeaaaabbcode. What I want is something like code[a][b]code, but with with both of those having equal length, so something like code[a]x[b]xcode where x is a possible length. Is it possible to do this with one javascript regex, should I use multiple regexes for the multiple possibilities I dont think I will need to check for length 32 or higher or should I code it in myselfp
Negative 58299 pI have three jpa entities Im trying to get working together. BoxProfile, BoxProfileItemAssignment and BoxItem all code listed below. BoxProfileItemAssignment has a EmbeddedId using MapId to map the composite key.p  pBoxProfile has a set of BoxProfileItemAssignments, the assignments are a BoxItem and quantity value. I want to be able to persist BoxProfileItemAssignments while persisting a new BoxProfile. Each BoxItem in a BoxProfileItemAssignments has already been persisted when a BoxProfile is being created. p  pIm using spring data JpaRepository interfaces to persist my BoxProfile entities and accessing the repo through a service layer BoxProfileService.p  pWhen I attempt to persist a new BoxProfile entity I get a PersistenceException due to a detached entity. I understand that the BoxItem that is nested in the BoxProfileItemAssignment entity Im passing in is detached but Im not looking to make and changes or updates to said entity I just want to use it create the BoxProfileItemAssignment entry. p  pAfter much research I cant seem to find an example of Cascading persisted with a nested composite key entity which itself has a nested entity.p  pI would appreciate if someone could tell me what the correct combination of annotations are to achieve my goal.p  blockquote   pjavax.persistence.PersistenceException org.hibernate.PersistentObjectException

Negative 58299 pI cannot for the life of me find anything that pertains to the scenario Im in. And to preface, Im relatively new to SQL CLR Triggers in general. The scenario Im in has a CLR Trigger assembly that Ive created in my SQL Server, where the .NET code itself does some business logic based on an inserted or updated record to a single database table. Essentially, the .NET code pulls that data from the table to do its work, then updates the same table.p  pIn all, Ive got this working just fine, as long as the SQL Server and the application with the .NET code in question resides on the same machine. Ive set up a development environment for our real world customers with a SQL Server residing on one machine, and the application that employs the SQL Server on a different machine, trying to mimic the distributed environment. However, when the trigger fires in SQL Server, how does the application use that trigger when it is on another machinep  pHere is what I think I know, or rather questions so that I verify Im thinking about it correctly.p  pOur clients use a distributed environment where the SQL Server used by one or more of our applications can use from remote machines. Already know about starvation on triggers that take too long, and Ive got that handled. Does a CLR Trigger need to be employed to a specific server or for a SQL Server Project can that server by determined dynamicallyp  pDoes the SqlContext know the contextual relationship with the SQL Server machine Or is that determined in the VS project file and is specifically indicated Can it be changed or does the CREATE ASSEMBLY always keep the defined value based on the compile it is created againstp  pI know that the trigger is created in SQL Server, and the same trigger reference is set up in the .NET code [SqlTriggerNameaTrigger, etc.... In other words, how does the remote application know that a trigger set up in SQL Server has fired Does the SqlContext only know a trigger has fired if the application itself calls into the SQL Server If so, what happens when an insertupdate occurs in the SQL Management Studiop  pOk, enough with the questions. I could go on a while with them, so lets see if anything makes sense to anyone first. I might be in over my head with this stuff. Thanks for any advice given.p

Negative 58299 pSo Ive been building a program that uses Monte Carlo simulations to find properties of evolutionary graph theory. One of the key functions of this is to be able to generate uniformlydistributed random graphs, so that we can determine the generalised properties of graphs. For the case of connected undirected graphs I have implemented the solution outlined in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14618505thisa answer. p  pHowever for directed graphs, generating the onedirectional uniform spanning tree you get from Wilsons algorithm doesnt ensure that the graph is stronglyconnected, and it seems that adding extra edges to make the spanning tree bidirectional would introduce a bias into the graphs that you generate. p  pI feel like I might be missing something obviousmisunderstanding something, but essentially my request is, can someone recommend to me a highlevel scheme that allows me to generate stronglyconnected, uniformlydistributed, random digraphsp

Negative 58299 pIve been developing a COBOL grammar with support of embedded SQL statements. For anyone whos not familiar with COBOL, here is an example.p  precodeMOVE A TO B. EXEC SQL     SELECT C FROM T WHERE ID1     INTO E ENDEXEC MOVE F TO G codepre  pThe code between EXEC SQL and ENDEXEC uses a specially augmented SQL syntax, which is a perfect example of island grammar.p  pI know this can be implemented with Lexer mode in ANTLR4. But I have another requirement that the SQL grammar should be separated from COBOL grammar so that the SQL grammar could be reused when embedded in other languages like PL1, without copy paste programming.p  pSo what I did is using a simple lexer mode to capture anything between EXEC SQL and ENDEXEC, extract the SQL code as a String and give it to a separate SQL lexer and parser. p  pThis worked OK with one drawback  the line numbers and char index of tokens recognized in the SQL parser is counted from the start of the extracted SQL code string, instead of starting from the original COBOL program. When it comes to tracking back to source code, e.g. in case there are parsing errors, the line numbers turn out to be misleading. p  pSo the question is  is there a simpler way in ANTLR 4 to implement island grammars seperately both lexer and parser seperated, yet still preserving correct line numbers and char index in the tokens generated for the island partp  pUpdate I found there is grammar import feature in ANTLR 4 and my colleague told me weve been trying that but failed. The problem is  lexer mode in imported grammar are not well supported, which gets compiling errors. This issue is being tracked a hrefhttpsgithub.comantlrantlr4issues160 relnofollowherea.p

Negative 58299 pIm working on an app where I want to signal iTunes at certain times to play single tracks from whatever playlist happens to be active. Ive just started studying Scripting Bridge, Ive used the commandline tools Apple references to create an iTunes.h file, and Ive got this and ScriptingBridge.framework in my project. Now I thought all I would have to do isp  precodeiTunesApplication iTunes  [SBApplication applicationWithBundleIdentifiercom.apple.iTunes] codepre  pand when I want to cue whatever track is up nextp  precode[iTunes playOnceYES] codepre  piTunes does respond, but if I understand Apples sample code, the YES parameter should compel it to play one and only one track. In fact, it doesnt seem to matter whether its YES or NO iTunes always plays from the selected track to the end of the playlist, however many tracks that may be. Am I missing something And since I need to send only one very simple Apple Event, is there a simpler way to do this than going through the whole Scripting Bridge frameworkp

Negative 58299 pI am here looking for help on improving our app as a startup. Hope youre kind enough to have glance and provide us feedback of how we can tackle the problems.p  pOur application is done in the development phase, the source code was just handed to us and we found that the application is done poorly by the outsourced developers, our inhouse developers are now working their best to tackle the problems. However, we would like to seek for consultation from different angles.p  pLong story short, there are 2 problems in our application, we are using Google Cloud Messaging GCM for user A sending request to another device B, or to obtain realtime information. We find this process is very slow and inconsistent where B only receive the request after few minutes or if the app is killed or idle, the request will be shown like a SPAM next day when user reactivate the app. p  pSecond problem, in our application we have sections such as user profile, settings, and some other pages, but we notice that every time we click on page say User profile, it will take a sec or two to request and reload to the page, and even the reload will take place if you go back and forth between user profile and setting, and things doesnt seem to be captured by the server and database if there is any amendments happened. We find that such flow creates too much request which might burden our resource when traffic is getting higher. p  pI am not sure if we are understanding the root problem correctly, and it seems Ive tried my best to articulate the concerns. I hope some of you can provide us some advises of how to tackle such issues or where should we start. Really appreciate your time to even reach to this sentence  p

Negative 58299 pIn my Git repository Ive got quite a lot of images changing to other VCS then Git is out of the question. Part of the images, are duplicates with a different size, these are created by ImageMagick. From time to time, I have to regenerate the images, which is ok, however, even though the image itself didnt change [size is the same etc] git marks this file as modified. I assume this is because of last modified dates, is that right Is there any chance, I could change the way git tracks changes of images Is there anyway to add ImageMagicks compare functionalityp  pThanks, Krystianp

Negative 58299 pWhen I have multiple async requests out for data, how can I guarantee the responses wont happen in the same event loop Those responses will both trigger dispatches from the action creators causing dispatch within a dispatch message.p  pNote that the data are strongnotstrong dependent on each other so using codewaitForcode doesnt do anything.p  pFor example, two componentsp  precodelet Post  React.createClass     getInitialState           return              post PostStore.getPostpostID This triggers an API call              ,      render           return              ltAuthorsgt                 let Authors  React.createClass     getInitialState           return              authors UserStore.getAuthors This also triggers an API call                codepre  pI get codedispatch within a dispatchcode invariant every time. Now if I were to bootstrap the data or put codeUserStore.getAuthorscode dispatch behind the codesetTimeoutfunc, 0code hack it will work fine since it forces the second API call to dispatch on the next event loop. However, Im sure that at some point Im going to run into this issue again. For instance, what if I have a twitter feed that updates via API requests on a poll How can I guarantee that the API request wont come back and interfere with another dispatchp  pI can bootstrap data like sop  precodePostStore.initializewindow.posts UserStore.initializewindow.users codepre  pWhy doesnt that create a dispatch within a dispatch invariant Is it not two dispatches at the same timep

Negative 58299 pIm finding a very annoying behaviour on Chrome.p  pIve a page where Im using a js graph library to build Gantt diagrams with vacation days of company workers.p  pThe library uses HTML5 canvas to draw the graph, and the page just loads data based on date and department parameters and feeds the library methods.p  pBoth, Firefox and Chrome, work perfectly and draws the Gantt diagrams as expected, however, when I try to print it, I find that Chrome changes the diagram if I alter any of printing attributes on page configuration dialog.p  pAlso, after closing printing dialog, the graph on the page gets also changed.p  pPrinting in Firefox hasnt any effect on the page and doesnt redraws the graph when changing printing parameters.p  pIve been looking for info into this on internet but found nothing except a maybe related bug on Chrome from 2014 that seems to be fixed.p  pIm a bit lose with this and would appreciate any insight on the matter.p

Negative 58299 pTo make a long story short, I have a college class next semester that deals with c. Ive known this since late July, so to get more used to programming languages before hand, Ive decided to practice Ruby for a few months and then switch to C before the class starts at January.p  pCurrently, Im only using this website to learn Ruby. I decided that my deadline of learning ruby and switching to c will be late next month in October.p  pGauging my current progress, hopefully the things Ive learned in Ruby before I switch would be strings, user input, variables, numbers, arithmetic operators, methods, and control statements ifelse, collections arrayshashes, loops while into, for, iteration, .times method, classes, objects, Booleans, and Ruby blocks.p  pWhat are the main things I need to look out for when switch over to C What are some things that I cant take for granted unlike when I was using Ruby Due to the detail and complexity of  these programming languages, I understand if you cant list a lot of things, but I would really love it if you could just a few key things listed.p

Primary key is datetime. Right now there are 8 columns but I will have a lot more variables more columns. I am not reallz good at python but I dont like the statement because its kind of hardcoded. Could I make this statement somehow in a for cycle or something so It doesnt have to be so long and I dont have to write all the variables manuallyp  pThx for your helpp
