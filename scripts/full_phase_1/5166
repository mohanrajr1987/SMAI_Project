Positive 5166 pIm using ASP.NET MVC 5 amp C. Basically when I click a button on my website, it should generate a report in async manner. Generating report takes 10 minutes.

I also have my async action method in place properly. If I hit the generate report button then it starts processing it and display Report generated once the report is generated like in 10 minutes.p  pThats fine. But after clicking the button, if I try to access any other area on the website like clicking on other tabbuttonetc then it immediately displays me the error message An error occurred, which is coming from ajax error section  See below code.

Negative 5166 pIts so harrying Every time when I connect my iPod touch to my mac, iTunes launches and starts synchronizing. This causes collisions with Xcode when it tries to install the app on the device in this time. And my exposwindows always jump to the iTunes window.

I use it just for apps anyways and most of the time, I just want to testdebug or just charge the battery.p  pI couldnt see any option in the menus to do that.

I cant seem to get this to work.  p  pIf someone has an idea of what Im doing wrong, then maybe they could also answer the second half of my question  that if the textbox loses focus but it was the popup that receives focus, that the popup will remain open or give focus back to the textbox so that it will remain open bc of the first binding. Any other control that gains focus when the textbox loses focus does not apply to this scenario.p  pIf I could reword this for clarity I would say it like this.p  pstrong1.strong Bind codePopup.IsOpencode to codeTextBox.IsFocusedcodep  pstrong2.strong Bind codeTextBox.IsFocusedcode to codePopup.IsFocusedcodeassuming this will just give focus back to the textboxp  hr  pHere is my first C attempt at this.

Negative 5166 pC question here.. p  pI have a UTF8 string that is being interpreted by a nonUnicode program in C.. This text which is displayed improperly, but as far as I can tell, is intact, is then applied as an output filename..p  pAnyway, in a C project, I am trying to open this file with an emSystem.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialogem object.  The filenames I am getting from this objects em.FileNames[]em is in Unicode UCS2.  This string, however, has been misinterpreted.. For example, if the original string was strong0xe3 0x81 0x82strong, a FileName[].ToCharArray reveals that it is now strong0x00e3 0x0081 0x201astrong .... .. It might seem like the OpenFileDialog object only padded it, but it is not.. In the third character that the OpenFileDialog produced, it is different and I cannot figure out what happened to this byte..p  pMy question is Is there any way to treat the filenames highlighted in the OpenFileDialog box as UTF8p  pI dont think its relevant, but if you need to know, the string is in Japanese..p  pThanks,p  pkrebp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pFirst of all, thanks to everyone whos offered their suggestions here, theyre very much appreciated.p  pNow, to answer the suggestions to modify the C application to handle the strings properly,  it doesnt seem to be feasible. It isnt just one application that is doing this to the strings.. There are actually a great number of these applications in my company that I have to work with, and it would take huge amount of manpower and time that simply isnt available. However, sean es idea would probably be the best choice if I were to take this route..p  pRemy Lebeau I think hit the nail right on the head, I will try your proposed solution and report back..  I guess the caveat with your solution is that the emDefaultem encoding has to be the same on the C application environment as the C application environment that created the file, which certainly makes sense as it would have to use the same code page..p  pJeff Johnson Im not pasting the filenames from the C app to the C app.. I am calling OpenFileDialog.ShowDialog and getting the OpenFileDialog.FileNames on DialogResult.OK.. I did try to use Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes, but like Remy Lebeau pointed out, it wont work because the original UTF8 bytes are lost..p  peveryone else Thanks for the ideas.. p  pkrebp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pRemy Lebeau Your idea worked perfectly As long as the environment of the C app is the same as the environment of the C app is the same same locale for nonUnicode programs I am able to retrieve the correct text..  p  pNow I have more problems.. Haha.. Is there any way to determine the encoding of a string The code now works for UTF8 strings that were mistakenly interpreted as ANSI strings, but screws up UCS2 strings. I need to be able to determine the encoding and process each accordingly. GetEncoding doesnt seem to be useful..  And neither is StreamReaders CurrentEncoding property always says UTF8..p  pP.S. Should I open this new question in a new postp

Negative 5166 pIm building a Zendbased Web app that will permit thirdparty extensions.p  pEssentially, this applications database will have a generic content store. Extensions are added to render different pieces of content in different ways.p  pThink of a rich mail store When the user asks for a Calendar item, I instantiate a Calendar class or something and ask it to render the items content. The same database might contain Mail items, which are rendered by a different class or whatever. So Im basically defining a base class with the needed methods to handle content items, and then addins are written which inherit from that to deal with specific item types.p  pEach of these addins may need to access its own View files, since each of them will obviously have a different visual layout. p  pI cant foresee all the content renderers that might be used new ones will be installed in some fashion so that my application knows when I see content with a database type column of XYZ, Ill call the XYZ thing to render that.p  pLikely, what will happen is this User will visit a URL for the application, thus triggering an action within a Controller. That Controller will use a Model method, telling it which specific content item was requested.p  pFrom there, either the Model or the Controller which needs to call something what that gets the item from the database okay, the Model clearly does that and renders it using some predetermined View. This would be PART of a larger page that might well include several rendered items as in, a list of content items. p  pSo two questionsp  ul lipWhats the best way to architect this in Zend Framework I emdoem want these addins to inherit from a base renderer class that I provide, because very simple renderers may simply need to call functionality from that base class, rather than having any of their own code e.g., a Note and a Memo might well use the simplified rendering functionality from the base renderer class.pli lipWhats the best way to register these addins with my application An .ini file, perhaps a database table The goal is simplified installation steps for whoever is operating the application  e.g., editing an .ini file is often easier than manually querying a database, although I could also provide an admin backend UI for new content renderers to be registered in.pli ul

Negative 5166 pHaving a very strange issue regarding postback in ASP.NET. I have page dynamically populating DropdownLists on PageLoad, only if its not a postback. I also have several textboxes on the page for user input.p  pIf I postback, either by clicking a submit button or via a SelectedIndexChanged event, the textboxes maintain their values, but the DropdownLists lose all their items  but only IF the page is loaded via an iFrame. If I load the page directly, everything works fine. If I load it via an iFrame, everything but the dropdowns works.p  pHas anyone run into this behavior before I dont think it matters, but Im on Windows7, IIS7, ASP.NET 3.5 and browing with IE8. ViewState is enabled, which is apparent from the textboxes having their values persisted. The ASP.NET page is in a WebApp hosted on localhost. The containing page, with the IFrame tag is just a dummy HTML file sitting on my desktop for testing. Is this perhaps just an IE security issuep  pUPDATE I actually just moved the dummy container page into the Webapp and it seems to work fine, even via the iFrame. Still, Id like to know why this is happening if the containing page is outside the Webapp as I intend on having people load the page in and iFrame via other domains..p

Negative 5166 pIm working on a computer vision problem which requires rendering a 3d model using a calibrated camera.  Im writing a function that breaks the calibrated camera matrix into a modelview matrix and a projection matrix, but Ive run into an interesting phenomenon in opengl that defies explanation at least by me.p  pThe short description is that negating the projection matrix results in nothing being rendered at least in my experience.  I would expect that multiplying the projection matrix by any scalar would have no effect, because it transforms homogeneous coordinates, which are unaffected by scaling.p  pBelow is my reasoning why I find this to be unexpected maybe someone can point out where my reasoning is flawed.p  pImagine the following perspective projection matrix, which gives correct resultsp  precode    [ a b c 0 ] P  [ 0 d e 0 ]     [ 0 0 f g ]     [ 0 0 h 0 ] codepre  pMultiplying this by camera coordinates gives homogeneous clip coordinatesp  precode[xc]   [ a b c 0 ]   [Xe] [yc]  [ 0 d e 0 ]  [Ye] [zc]   [ 0 0 f g ]   [Ze] [wc]   [ 0 0 h 0 ]   [We] codepre  pFinally, to get normalized device coordinates, we divide xc, yc, and zc by wcp  precode[xn]   [xcwc] [yn]  [ycwc] [zn]   [zcwc] codepre  pNow, if we negate P, the resulting clip coordinates should be negated, but since they are homogeneous coordinates, multiplying by any scalar e.g. 1 shouldnt have any affect on the resulting normalized device coordinates.  However, in openGl, negating P results in nothing being rendered.  I can multiply P by any nonnegative scalar and get the exact same rendered results, but as soon as I multiply by a negative scalar, nothing renders.    What is going on herep  pThanksp

Now and then, it seems as the database enters an unstable mode, and the application starts responding something right, something wrong. The typical error is that apparently, an empty DataTable is returned to the public disruption overview or to the RSS generator. Thus, the user gets e.g. an empty GridView, but no exception is thrown AFAIK, and nothing is written to the Windows Application log. After a restart of the SQL Server Express service, the situation is back to normal.p  pIt has to be said that the situation first time appeared a few days after I made a new minor upgrade of the application. The RSS generator was slightly rewritten, and I added a WCF REST service. But the DAL and the database schema were untouched... p  pAny hints of how we could keep the database stable It is a bit annoying not to have a clue p

Negative 5166 pFor version control we currently use Visual Source Safe and are thinking of migrating to another version control system SVN, Mercurial, Git.p  pCurrently we use Visual Source Safes Shared file feature quite heavily.

In Visual Source Safe they are shared between the specific projects, which means that whenever the files are updated in one project they are updated in any project they are shared with.p  pThis is a simple example but hopefully it explains why we use the shared feature to reduce the amount of duplicated code and ensure that when a bug is fixed all projects automatically have access to the new fixed code.p  pAfter researching alternatives to Visual Source Safe it seems that most version control systems do not have the idea of shared files, instead they seem to use the idea of sub repositories.  a hrefhttpmercurial.selenic.comwikisubrepos relnofollowhttpmercurial.selenic.comwikisubreposa httpsvnbook.redbean.comen1.0ch07s03.htmlp  pMy question after all of that is about what the best practices for achieving this are using other version control systemsp  ol lipShould we restructure our projects so that two copies of the files do not exist and an include directory is used instead e.g.p  pstrongProduct Onestrongp  ul liDesign  Login.cpp  Login.hli liRuntime  Login.cpp  Login.hli liCommon  Helper.cpp  Helper.hli ulli ol  pThis still leaves what to do with Login.cpp and Logon.hp  ol lipShould the shared files be moved to their own repository and then compiled into a lib or dll This would make bug fixing more time consuming as the lib projects would have to be edited and then rebuilt.pli lipShould we use externals or sub repositoriespli lipShould we combine our projects i.e. runtime, design, and launcher into one large projectpli ol  pAny help would be appreciated. We have the feeling that our project design has evolved based on the tools that we used and now that we are thinking of switching tools its difficult for us to see how we can best modify our practices. p  pOr maybe we are the only people are there doing this...p  pAlso, we use Visual Studio for all of our stuff.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5166 pI am new to Mac OS X programming and so I am going through an introductory text that includes building interfaces using Interface Builder 3.2.3 for both Cocoa and Carbon.

So I tried downloading the source code files from the publishers website and found that they ran with no problems.p  pIm trying to find the differences between the publishers working and my nonworking versions of the code.  I started by just trying to compare the attribute settings as listed in Inspector but I could not find any differences.  I then came across File Merge which I used to compare the .nib files for the two different versions.  File Merge does show the differences but since I am unfamiliar with the markup language used in the .nib file and it lists too many differences to track down without being knowledgeable enough to know what is relevant or not, it really hasnt been very helpful.p  pMy question is whether or not there is a tool or method available that will better show me the differences in the two versions of the code than what I can see in the Inspector window but also shows it in a more condensed and user friendly form than what is provided by File Merge.  What is the recommended toolmethodology to debugging code in Interface Builderp  pAlso, can anyone recommend documentation where I can become familiar with reading and debugging the code in the .nib file in case that is the only way to find the differencesp  pThanksp

Negative 5166 pThe gnomonic projection maps spherical triangles to straightedged plane triangles.p  pBut Ive heard that the Chamberlin trimetric projection has less distortion, so Id like to use that instead. Alas, when I use my extremely rough and probably buggy implementation of Chamberlin trimetric projection to map the spherical triangle formed by its 3 base points to the plane, I seem to be getting a shape that is emalmostem a triangle, but the three lines curve and bulge out. Is that a bug in my code, or is it supposed to do thatp  pIs there some other way of mapping a spherical triangle to a straightedged plane triangle that has less distortion than the gnomonic projectionp  pEDIT My goal here is to make a custom a hrefhttpwww.progonos.comfurutiMapProjNormalProjPolyprojPoly.html relnofollowpolyhedral mapa of Earth. If you print out something from the a hrefhttpwww.progonos.comfurutiMapProjNormalProjPolyFoldoutfoldout.html relnofollowMap Foldoutsa page, you will have something almost exactly like what Im trying to make.p  pI have 2 triangles. One is a spherical triangle drawn on a 3D globe. By definition, each edge of a spherical triangle is part of a great circle. When you look at that 3D globe, there are a bunch of cities, coastlines, etc. that are hopefully accurately plotted on that 3D globe, inside that spherical triangle.p  pThe other triangle is a flat, plane 2D, straightedged, Euclidean triangle. On paper. At the moment the interior of that triangle is blank white paper, but eventually I want to draw a copy of all those cities, coastlines, etc. into that area.p  pEvery map projection will map that 3D spherical triangle to a 2D image. Then its easy to in 2D rotate and slide and shrink, and perhaps skew, that image until the 3 corners exactly line up with the 3 corners of my plane triangle. If I stack the results of a bunch of different map projections on top of each other, even though Ive forced the 3 corners to exactly line up, each projection will put the cities in a slightly different location. Unfortunately, many projections take cities that are slightly inside the spherical triangle and draw them slightly outside the flat 2D triangle. One symptom of this problem is that the sides of the spherical triangle are mapped to plane 2D curves whose endpoints match the corners properly, but they bulge outward slightly from perfectly straight lines drawn between the corners. That leads to the city being completely missing from my polyhedral map.p  pId rather not run the risk of some Polish mathematician getting upset that Warsaw is inexplicably missing from the flat, plane 2d, paper map that Ive made .p  pSo Im looking for map projections that keep it inside the lines. I need 3 specific great circles the edges of the spherical triangle to be mapped to straight lines on paper.

However, Hibernate sends no UPDATE query to the database, only the INSERT query corresponding to the Friendship entity.p  pI have tried different events on the EntityListener, but it does not seem to work.p  pWhat I suppose is happening here is that the entity listener is triggered by an update to the a User. It then identifies all the dirty properties of the user, which consist of the List alone. Therefore it has nothing to do about the User, it has only to insert a Friendship. It then cascades the operation to the Friendship. The entity listener is called, it modifies the user, but at this time Hibernate has already determined that it had not to worry about the user, therefore it does not update the user.p  pIs this reasoning correctp  pIf so, how can I properly achieve thisp  pThanks, Brunop
Negative 5166 pI have found my self in quite a pickle. I have tables of only one column supression or inclusion lists that are more or less varchar25 but the thing is I wont have time to index them before using them in the main query and, depending how inportant it is, I wont know how many rows are in each table. The base table at the heart of all this is some 1.4 million rows and some 50 columns.p  pMy assumptions are as followsp  pIN shoulnt be used in cases with a lot of values rows returned because it looks though the values serially, right IN on a subquery not passed the values directlyp  pJoins INNER for inclusion and LEFT and checking for Nulls when supression are the best for large sets of data over 1k rows or so to mach top  pEXISTS has always concerned me because it seems to be doing a subquery for every row all 1.4 million  Yikes.p  pMy gut say, if feasable get the count of the supression table and use either IN for sub 1k rows and INNERLEFT Join for suppression tables above 1k rows  Note, and field I will be supressing on will be index in the big base table but the supression table wont be.  Thoughtsp  pThanks in advance for any and all comments andor advice.p

Negative 5166 pI followed the excellent post by Nadia here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions860055jqueryoverridedefaultvalidationerrormessagedisplaycsspopuptooltiplikehttpstackoverflow.comquestions860055jqueryoverridedefaultvalidationerrormessagedisplaycsspopuptooltiplikea and it works great. But the form i am working on is submitted via ajax and a table above the form is updated when succesful The table grows with each submit and the position of the form slides down on the page as a result. Nadias solution postions the error message when the errorPlacement function is called. The problem is that errorPlacement is only called the 1st time an error occurs. When the user corrects the error the div is hidden but not removed. So the next time there is a validation failure the validate function only replaces the html of the div wrapper.

Negative 5166 pSorry for the subjective post but I thought this was a topic worth discussing.  With 4.0 WPF  finally became a pretty solid platform to develop rich applications with. However, theres some things that I still find quite limiting. With v.Next approaching it might be useful to highlight what your biggest WPF gripe is  also dont forget to submit it to httpdotnet.uservoice.comforums40583wpffeaturesuggestionsp  pHeres my biggest gripes, whats yours p  p1 strongAnimation qualitystrong. They could be smoother, dont get me wrong animations are nice but theyre not of the quality you see with iOS  for instance. Im not sure if this is because WPF doesnt have support for vsync, making it hard to have those ultra smooth animationsp  p2 strongNo multithreading in the UIstrong. I understand the reasoning and I hear there was a model for multithreading in the UI that was scrapped due to complexitydeadlines. The current model however is very limiting IMO. Currently you cant have one animation running and start doing anything else UI intensive without the animation stuttering. Even if rearchitecturing WPF to be multithreaded would be beyond their scope they should try and make animations multithreaded somehow. Currently the only way around this is using and layering windows running on different threads, and that gets old fast.p  p3 strongNo native WPF  webbrowser controlstrong Sure you can use the windows forms webcontrol but its not a native WPF control that you can manipulate and the performance is still pretty bad. Compare that with the Chromium browser for WPF which is awesomely fast. Hopefully theyll get around to integrating IE9 properlyp  p4 strongText qualitystrong,  With WPF 4.0 they improved text quality a lot, especially for small text. However I still see many WPF apps with suboptimal textrendering. Its especially noticeably  for medium to large text. Im not saying its bad its not just great either. If they could take text quality with rendering on par with Photoshop maybe per configuration so you could sacrifice performance for quality where needed   it would really put WPF over the edge and allow us to build some great looking applications.p  p5 strongThe template systemstrong This is probably a pet peeve and I totally agree with the design thinking around templating controls. Separating functionality from design is great. However I usually find the way its currently done is pretty messy and subclassing custom controls to change some aspect and knowing what control to changemodify isnt exactly easy. Perhaps they could make it a bit easier p  p6 strongOverally performancestrong. WPF is pretty fast but its not lighting fast in some instances. If the different panels, flowdocument etc could be tweaked to be more instaneous it would be great for user experience. Probably another area that would benefit for taking advantage of multiple cores in the architecture.p
Negative 5166 pI have this idea, but I am unsure if it is PCI compliant.  Im new to the arena of PCI compliance and am curious to know if this scenario violates PCI.p  pSo, lets set up the scenario.  Company A is PCI compliant and has a web service on https exposing bits of functionality around payment processing.  Company B is not compliant, but their website is secure.p  pHere are the steps of the scenario.p  ol liBs website contacts As webservice via server side code.  This service sends back an encrypted authetication token.li liB injects this token into a page containing a form for accepting credit card information.li liThe user enters their credit card information on Bs website.li liThe form information, along with the token, are sent via an ajax call to As webservice.li liAs webservice processes the data and spits back a status ApprovedDeniedetcli ol  pThe question is, since the javascript goes directly from the users machine to Company As compliant servers, is it PCI compliant  Im very interested to know what experts in this arena think.p

Negative 5166 pIve been trying to figure out a solution to this problem but havent been 100 successful, just pseudo successful. The layout Im looking for is one such that there is always a fixed paddingmarginheight on the top and bottom of the page no matter the height of the content.p  pFurther, the height of the content should start at the top of the page right after the padding and reach the bottom of the page right before the padding. If the height of the content isnt large enough, it should span the whole page. If it is larger than the height of the page, the scrollbar should appear as in normal situations, but the topbottom paddings need to be preserved.p  pTo view an example of my pseudosolution to this, check out this fiddle...p  ul lipa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUnsungHero97uUEwg1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netUnsungHero97uUEwg1a ... height not large enoughpli lipa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUnsungHero97uUEwg8 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netUnsungHero97uUEwg8a ... height too largepli ul  pThe problem with my solution is that if there is a background image, it will be covered up where the padding is. So how do I extend my solution such that if there is a background image, it will still be visible where the topbottom paddings are I would prefer this to be a HTMLCSS only solution, which is what makes this really hardp  pLet me know if I need to clarify anything.p

Negative 5166 pI have a lot of legacy data access code mainly SqlCommand with Stored Procedure calls that we used to execute alot of Insert statment into an database.  As long as the SQL server has been on the same machine as the application there have been acceptable performace but now are we trying to move some of the data to SQL Azure.p  pThe problem is that our code calls a SP for every record to insert which results in quite a few trips to the database and when not located on the same server it takes some time. p  precodevar conn  new SqlConnectionconnString var cmd  new SqlCommandconn, spMyStoreProc cmd.Params.Adda, SqlDbType.VarChar, 10 cmd.Params.Addb, SqlDbType.Int  usingconn   conn.Open  foreachvar rec in recordsToInsert      cmd.Parameters[a].Value  rec.A    cmd.Parameters[b].Value  rec.B    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery    conn.Close  codepre  pI have tried the code above with and without Transactions.p  pI have also tried to use a batch SQL statement to execute several SPs in every trip to the server. Like thisp  precodevar cmd  new SqlCommandconn cmd.CommandText  EXEC spMyStoreProc aa b2 EXEC spMyStoreProc ab b4 codepre  pIt greatly increases the performance of the operation but since I have quite a few SPs where every SP has about 2050 params it gets quite tedious to write this code for all the insert commands in this data access component.p  pIs this the best way to achive this, or can I somehow tell ADO.NET I want to execute my calls as a batch havent fount anything suggesting its possible but feel that I atleast should ask to avoid network latency etc betweeen every single SP callp  pIf not does anybody know any good way to achive this without having to write it by hand and since its a legacy application I can not change the data layer completely. Is there any applications that can take SqlCommands with parameters and generate the TQL they would executep  pThanks in advancep

Contrast this with e.g. a   serviceoriented architecture SOA, where clients and servers   interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an   interface description language IDL.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpkinderman.net20100623approachingpurerestlearningtolovehateoas relnofollowhttpkinderman.net20100623approachingpurerestlearningtolovehateoasap  blockquote   pThe Twitter API, for example, has services that allow clients to   update their status, or retweet one that already exists. Twitters API   is not RESTful, so the documentation for retweeting a status instructs   developers to call the service by sending an HTTP POST or PUT request   to httpapi.twitter.com1statusesretweet[id].[format].p      pIf the Twitter API were RESTful, clients would need to understand what   it means to follow a link to retweet a status.

Negative 5166 pI am writing a log file decoder which should be capable of reading many different structures of files. My question is how best to represent this data. I am using C, but am new to OOP.p  pAn example The log files have a range of sensor values. One sensor reading can be called strongAstrong, another strongBstrong. Obviously, there are many more than 2 entry types. In different log files, they could be stored either as ABABABABAB or AAAAABBBBB.p  pI was thinking of describing this as blocks of entries. So in the first case, a block would be AB, with 5 blocks. In the second case, the first block is A, read 5 times. This is followed by a block of B, read 5 times.p  pThis is quite a simplification there are actually 40 different types of log file, each with up to 40 sensor values in a block. No log has more than 300 blocks.p  pAt the moment, I store all of this in a datatable. I have a column for each entry, with a property of how many to read. If this is set to 1, it continues to the next column in the block. If not, it will assume that it has reached the end of the block.p  pThis all seems quite clumsy. Can anyone suggest a better way of doing thisp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 5166 pI wrote a jquery plugin which filters the given dropdowns options as per the inputText specified and sorts them by number of words matched, with highest matches at the top. And this takes some time to execute probably needs some study of the code to find if any optimization is possible. There is no ajax call inside my plugin code, pure client side logic. So, right now I need to display a load indicator. My problem is that I am not able to properly display a load indicator which persists while the filtrationsorting code executes.   p  pemPlease note em My question here is not how to optimize the code but to display a persisting load indicator. p  pHere was my initial plugin code architecture  p  precodefunction       jQuery plugin definition      .fn.filterGroup  functionconfig                var settings                               some settings defined here                                       var thisDropdown  this master  copy          ifconfig                      .extendsettings, config                       this.eachfunction                                     thisDropdown  filterGroupOptionsfiltrableDropdown,inputText,settings,ignoreText                          allow jQuery chaining         return thisDropdown            function filterGroupOptionsfiltrableDropdown,inputText,settings,ignoreText             here is my main plugin code which filters the given dropdown options as per the inputText specified, and this takes some time to execute      codepre  pNow, because of the time taken by the filtrationsorting code, I need to display a load indicator while the filtration logic takes place, but I am so far not able to do that. At first I added a displayLoadIndicator in the beginning of the code inside the codethis.eachfunctioncode and a codehideLoadIndicatorcode at the end of the code insde the same codethis.eachfunctioncode. By displaying alerts at those points, I could see the the load indicator displayed and removed. I observed that even when the browser was hanging sometimes with too many words entered for search term codeinputTextcode was displaying codeNot Respondingcode. So, I guessed may be I needed to add a callback to my code and call codehideLoadIndicatorcode when I receive the callback, but still the load indicator does not persist. updated plugin codep  precodefunction       jQuery plugin definition      .fn.filterGroup  functionconfig                var settings                               some settings defined here                                       var thisDropdown  this master  copy          ifconfig                      .extendsettings, config                   this.eachfunction                                  showLoadIndicator                    see I am calling hideLoadIndicator on receiving callback here           filterGroupOptionsfiltrableDropdown,inputText,settings,ignoreText,functionreturnVal                      thisDropdown  returnVal             hideLoadIndicator               allow jQuery chaining             return thisDropdown                                 function filterGroupOptionsfiltrableDropdown,inputText,settings,ignoreText,callback                 here is my main plugin code which filters the given dropdown options as per the inputText specified, and this takes some time to execute              callbackfiltrableDropdown      codepre  pPreviously, I added I added callback like this when there was an AJAX call whose response was taking time.

Negative 5166 pIn Eclipse with SVN, I would like to see which changes line by line are done in another branch or trunk and then decide for each changed file if I want to keep my working copy version or the changed file.p  pI think this is the way it should work, but apparently it doesnt in SVNEclipse. I tried the merge functions, and I kept getting tree conflicts, trunk out of date errors, etc. Even with a very simple project with only 2 files in it, everything goes wrong. The automated merge thing just doesnt work for me  You have absolutely no control of what is actually going to happen to your files, and end up with a totally ruined working copy, in the case of conflicts.  Which you have to fix AFTER the mergep  pI do like the Compare Withfunction to compare branches with each other though. But I couldnt find any way to practically use this to update changed files. All I get is a nice treeview with all changed files, and the possibility to compare the actual changes, but no way of marking the changes as mergedp  pIt seems what I want is just not possible with Compare With  Is there NO other tool at all then where you have emtotalem control of your merges   Maybe I should change to GIT or Mercurial  p  pAny ideas about the subject are welcome...p  pemstrongUPDATEemstrongp  pFound these alternative SVN clients myself, both look promising for dealing with changes in different branchesp  pa hrefhttpwww.syncrosvnclient.com relnofollowhttpwww.syncrosvnclient.comap  pa hrefhttpwww.syntevo.comsmartsvn relnofollowhttpwww.syntevo.comsmartsvnap
Negative 5166 pI have a rails 3jquery application where a user comes across a new person form. In the form, one of the things he can do is to add addresses as he is constructing the person. I want the addresses to be added, and displayed either through Ajax, or on the page itself, but the addresses should be committed only once the person is saved if the user cancels the person creation, the addresses should also not be saved. The person form has fields for a person name, and a button to add addresses. On clicking on add address, a dialog pops up to enter addresses. As each address is added, it is shown inline with the form. p  pWhat is the best way to do this I am currently populating a div within the person using jquery to enter addresses     lt formtag ... do      lt textfieldtag personname     lt linkto Add address, nil, id  addaddresslink, remote  truebr                     lt submittag     ltend          addaddresslink.clickfunction        addresses.append...     br I could handle the submit, and read the address elements into a series of hidden fields not shown here, or use ajax instead of direct jquery click handler, and populate the hidden fields in an erb. Not sure what is the best way to achieve thisp  pThanks Anandp

Negative 5166 pI call a third party web service right now as part of my application. I am using the RestClient gem in order to do this. There are a ton of tools available to do the same thing, so that should not matter.p  pWhat Im curious about is having good enough tests, nothing too fancy, where I can simulate how my application responds when the third party web service is unavailable for whatever reason. Be it that I exceeded a rate limit or a timeout due to network latencycomplications, I just want to be able to take something like an HTTP status code and test what my application does in that event.p  pWhats the best way to do this with TestUnit Right now the call to the third party service is encapsulated inside of one of my controllers. I have a simple module with some wrapper methods for the different end points of the remote service. I just want to make sure that my application does the right things when the service is or isnt available.p  pIs using an additional framework next to TestUnit that can stub the right way to go about doing this Obviously I cant force a network timeout and starting to hack with things like IPtables just for tests is not worth the time. Im sure this problem has been solved a million times as integrating things such as Facebook and Twitter into web applications is so popular these days. How do you test for failure when reaching those APIs in a robustcontrolled formatp

Negative 5166 pIve been digging the web in quest of finding nice, androidish solution for this concrete problem, but havent found one, so here I am, posting my first question on StackOverflow.p  pTo elaborate on my problem, I have a fullfledged aidl service, to which some other processes bind. My service will allocate some resources for each of process connecting to it, and I want to make this statement bold, the resource allocation is made for process, I make some kind of a session tracking, where getCallingPid and getCallingUid play a role of session identifiers.p  pSo the problem here is that Android will never tell us if an application which was bound to us went away for some reason, so the system resources allocated for that destroyed process would be wasted away by being held by our service.p  pOne solution that I found somewhat feasible is just to poll a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActivityManager.htmlgetRunningAppProcesses2829 relnofollowActivityManager.getRunningAppProcessesa and calculate set difference between current and previous snapshots, but this method looks really dirty.p  pCould anyone suggest some better method to do this Id be really gratefulp  pThanks,p  pGiorgip

Negative 5166 pI am trying to build a system that uses nodejs with express to render html pages based on data from another backend service. The backend service provides JSON data that the nodejs server uses to render the html and then pass to the browser. Having read up on REST and the Hyemedia constraint I want to use this in the design, but can not seem to figure it out. A simple example would be a page that provides a list of items in which each item is a link that can be clicked on to get the full details of that item. So the backend service might make some JSON that looks likep  precode   title List of items   self httpapi.hostname.comitems   [             titleitem1,       url httpapi.hostname.comitems1                  titleitem2,       url httpapi.hostname.comitems2                     titleitem3,       url httpapi.hostname.comitems3       codepre  pI then have nodejs render a page in html with a list of links using title for the name. The issue is then I dont know what to use for the href. It would work if the href is to a view that with render the item likep  precodehrefitems2 codepre  pbut I have no way of pass the url field back to node so node can pass that to the backend service. I end up building the url for the backend service based on the view url. Which if I understand REST is not the Hypermedia way. It means my node code has to know the format of the urls of the backend service instead of getting the urls and using directly.p  pSo is there so clever feature like adding the url field as a query parameter of the href to preserve it on the client I am misunderstanding the Hypermedia Constraint or should I being trying to use it at allp

Is this possiblep  pIt seems other languages are more suited to this, such as RubyPHPPerlPython but I seem to be getting out of my depth getting these to work I have a emveryem small bit of ruby.p  pIs there any way to achieve this in R or to do most of the work in R but have the link in one of these other languages Thanks.p

Negative 5166 pSo, I am trying to programmatically add in a ModelFilter to my ObjectListView that will look at two or more columns and filters on each separately.  Currently, I think that ObjectListView only supports one filter, but I may be missing something in the codedocumentation.p  pAs an example, one of my intended filters is to look at column Active and that has values of A or T.  Another column is a Supervisor Name.  So, I want to find all entries where Supervisor name  Smith and Active  A.p  pI can get the filter to work for either of these options separately using TextMatchFilter, but cannot figure out how to get both to work at the same time.p  pThe minor problem I see is that if the Supervisor Name contains an A, then using the standard Filter will return the whole row.  I have been able to get around that by programmatically setting the Searchable property for columns to false if I dont want to look at them, and then turn them back on once the list is filtered.  However, I have a feeling that if I turn Searchable on for the Supervisor column, I will get the unwanted results.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to get the filter to work on multiple columns, using only the indicated columns for each filterp  pI have no sample code to show that helps in solving this.  However, if you really want to see what I have for my filtering code, I will be happy to add that it is in VB however.p  pCurrent Code  This looks at a value chosen by the user searchMeth and enables searching on that column.  It then does the search for what was entered in the txtSearch box.  However, in addition to this, I want to add in an additional filter for Supervisor.

Negative 5166 pI use NHibernate and have a custom type for encrypting passwords in the database so that I can use string properties to represent passwords, but NHibernate transforms  encrypts the value before storing in the db. Currently, I store a salt value and an encryption key in the config file, but Id really rather move to a password hash. However, the custom NHibernate type knows nothing about the object being stored other than the value of the property it is being told to handle, so I cant generate some random salt and store it with the object in another property from within this custom type. p  pSince I cant store the salt separately, I wonder if it would be OK to derive the salt from the password itself, and then hash the combination of the two. For example, I might take the password, MD5 hash it, then use the MD5 hash as the salt. Would this be OK This would allow me to persist the password in a deterministic manner while using a unique but derived salt value per password, but are there any security considerations when doing it this wayp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pBecause all of the answers Ive received so far have failed to account for the context of the question, let me present the signature of the method defined in NHibernate terms.p  precodepublic override void SetIDbCommand cmd, object value, int index      var param  IDataParametercmd.Parameters[index]      if value  null              param.Value  null          else              var temp  value.ToString         var encrypted  encryptor.Encrypttemp         param.Value  encrypted       codepre  pThats all NHibernate gives me. I receive the IDbCommand object, a value, and a parameter index. I know nothing about the parameters themselves or the type of object being persisted. I only have a value. I cannot generate a random salt and store it in a separate property, because I do not know what properties exist on the object being persisted, nor which order they are stored in the parameter collection. My goal is to hash the password in the most secure way possible strongwithin the context of this method callstrong. If youre going to argue against my suggestion, it would be helpful to receive an alternative idea strongwithin this contextstrong.p

So what I want here is AAAAAAAAAA.p  pThe catch is that Im only giving you the top strand. Im not giving you the bottom strand. You could generate yourself from the top strand  but given how large it is, I advise against that.p  pSo you need to convert coordinates. On the bottom strand, base 0 the rightmost C is opposed to base 39 on the top strand. Base 1 is against base 38. Base 2 is against case 37. Important point notice what happens when you add these two numbers up  every time. So base 10 is against base 29, and base 19 is against base 20.p  pSo if I want to find base 1020 on the bottom strand, I can look at base 2029 on the top and then reversecomplement it.p  pI need to figure out how to translate to coordinates on the bottom strand to the equivalent coordinates on the bottom strand.

What I would like is an explanation of why this code uses the modified puzzle when testing a word after backtracking out, rather than the original, unmodified puzzle.p

Negative 5166 pIm writing a hybrid XNA  Silverlight app for WP7 and Im trying to work out the touch splitting between them. Ive got this halfway worked out I can suppress XNA codeTouchPanelcode touches when the user clicks a Silverlight button. However I have not figured out how to throw out gameonly touches for Silverlight. So if youre holding a touch point in the game space say, for moving the player around, a second touch on a button wont work. It think its picking it up as a multitouch gesture and only allowing the first touch point to click buttons.p  pMy question is how can you suppress this touch point in Silverlight processingp

A is a test projectcontains [Test] inside, B is an NUnit addin projectcontains addin installer, EventListener interface implementations, etc. inside, and, A references B. Does this work Will the addin be calledp  pIf not, I assume it means that I must have the various .cs fileswhich implements the NUnit addin directly included in project A, rather than have them placed into a separate project and reference it in test project. Is that what you meanp  pIf so, another problem raised, that, when I have project C, D, E... which are also test projects, I have to include those various .cs fileswhich implements the NUnit addin in each test projectp

Negative 5166 pMy PHP script needs to check for matches throughout an array of data. Its currently looking for exact string matches. Id like it to be less strict. p  pFor example, if the array holds the string Tom and Jerry I would like to return true for Tom Jerry, Tom amp Jerry and maybe even Tom and Jery. I found links to PHP search engines they are more complex and not really what I need. My data is fairly small and dynamic, so theres no indexing.p  pI know I could write a big hairy regular expression, but Im pretty sure I would be reinventing the wheel, because Im sure others have already done this. Any advice on where to look or how to approach this would be much appreciated.p  pEDIT To clarify, Im trying to avoid entering all the dynamically generated data into a DB.p

Ive found both the IBindingList and IBindingListView interfaces, but making my class inherit either of these interfaces doesnt solve the problem.p  pHow do I do this I am completely stuck here...p

Negative 5166 pIm currently working on getting images for product options showing up on my first magento build. I have a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq11318915653929THISa figured out for bundled product, like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsI57c.jpg altscreenshotp  pIm obtaining urls of related images swatches, for example when the options for the select gets built. Now Im trying to do the same with configurable products, but it does not seem to be as straightforward.p  pConfigurable products are built from simple products which represent each iteration of available options. Great. I can obviously upload images for each simple product, and that would be a good start to a solution to this.p  pFor example  Chair has 3 upholstery and 2 armrest choices 6 simple products.  For chair 2b I upload upholstery swatch 2 and armrest swatch b, and label them accordingly. When the options get built, I grab image urls associated with each simple product by their label maybe grabbing all images for that label and removing duplicates or somethign... p  pIn Magento, I seep  pIn strongthemecatalogproductviewtypeoptionconfigurable.phtmlstrong p  precodeltphp foreachattributes as attribute gt     ..      ltselect namesuperattribute[ltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt] idattributeltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt classrequiredentry superattributeselectgt         ltoptiongtltphp echo thisgtChoose an Option... gtltoptiongt     ltselectgt     .. ltdivgt ltphp endforeach gt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var spConfig  new Product.Configltphp echo thisgtgetJsonConfig gt ltscriptgt codepre  pUnlike the bundle, the configurable product selectoptions are injected onto the page via javascript in codejsvarienconfigurable.jscode. This class is then reliant on codegetJsonConfigcode to supply all information after that. p  pAt this point, it seems I should be able to obtain a simple products image url information from that object. Tho I see no logic dealing with images at all in configurable.js.  strongHow would I go about obtaining those urls and associating them with the related option selectsstrongp  pAny advice on how I should proceed with this would be great. p  pCheersp  hr  p... also This really seems like dropdead nobrainer absolutelyrequired functionality. Why wouldnt magento support stuff like this out of the boxp  hr  h2updateh2  pI finally got this figured out, for those individuals interested in something similar. p  pMy first method of dealing with this  getting images from the child products worked to a degree, but got convoluted when trying to grab unique image urls for multiple sets of attributes. It also meant having to supply an image for each option in a simple product, so  a lot of unnecessary labor. p  pI ended up using the a hrefhttpwww.johannreinke.comen20120205magentoaddimagestoproductattributeoptions relnofollowfree plugina with some modifications that Greg Demetrick suggested. Its a pretty solid little module that allows for image urls to be associated with any attribute option  as well as a couple of methods for grabbing them. p  pMy final solution looks a bit like thisp  pstrongcatalogproductviewtypeoptionsconfigurable.phtmlstrongp  precodeltphp foreachattributes as attribute gt     markup for the attribute      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         lt[CDATA[         var attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt               attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.id  ltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt             attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.title  ltphp echo attributegtgetLabel gt             attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.data           ltphp          a  MagegetModeleavconfiggtgetAttributecatalogproduct, attributegtgetAttributeId          helper  Magehelperattributeoptionimage         foreach  agtgetSourcegtgetAllOptionstrue as option gt             attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.data.optionltphp echo option[value] gt               attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.data.optionltphp echo option[value] gt.val  ltphp echo option[value] gt             attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.data.optionltphp echo option[value] gt.imageurl  ltphp echo helpergtgetAttributeOptionImageoption[value] gt             attributedataltphp echo attributegtgetAttributeId gt.data.optionltphp echo option[value] gt.imgtitle  ltphp echo option[label] gt         ltphp endforeach gt         ]]gt     ltscriptgt      ltphp endforeach gt codepre  pThis gets printed in the markup, one set for each attribute. Which works nicely, but returns all options for the attribute, instead of only the options selected for the product data which teh codegetJsonConfigcode object has stored. So, then I just test my codeattributedataxxxcode object against the codespConfigcode, and send the unique matching options along to my controller script. p  pExtending codegetJsonConfigcode to grab the attribute urls would probably of worked as well...p  pWhatever the case  the key point here was associating image urls with the attribute options themselves instead of products.p  pCheersp

In these tables there are a good few uses of the codeImagecode data type.p  pWhen using the DBML designer I drag and drop my tables, and any fields that use the codeImagecode data type are mapped as codeSystem.Data.Linq.Binarycode when the classes are generated. However, I want these to be codeByte[]code.p  pCurrently, this is a manual process or changing the field type in the designer, and in all fairness is not that time consuming in the grand scale of things, but I would prefer if this was done automatically for me.p  pIs there a way that this can be done Some sort of Linq to Sql settingp  pThe main annoyance for me is when I make changes to a table that I need to readd, and then I have to change the fields back to codebyte[]codep

I need to print the array more than once and it does not print.p  pThe code for the Print function is p  precodetemplate ltclass Typegt  void queueTypeltTypegtdebugArray       forqueueFront queueFrontltcount queueFront     cout ltlt [ ltlt queueFrontltlt ] , ltlt list[queueFront] ltlt          end debugQueue codepre  pThe main.cpp code is p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include queueAsArray.h  using namespace std  int main      queueTypeltintgt q1     queueTypeltintgt q2     queueTypeltintgt q3     int x  5      forint i 0 ilt10 i          q1.addQueuei           cout ltlt q1 after being filled up with 10 items ltlt endl      q1.printQueueInfo      cout ltlt Queue contents from front to rearnn ltlt endl      q1.debugArray     q1.deleteQueue     q1.deleteQueue     q1.deleteQueue      forint i 0 ilt20 i         i5         q1.addQueuei           q1.debugArray     return 0  codepre  pstrongIs there a reason why the function call will not print againstrong  If you need the entire class and implementation file I can supply it. The weird thing is if I create a second instatiation of the class codeq2code, then build an array for codeq2code, the codedebugQueuecode function prints that queue. I then call the overloaded assignment operator and do codeq2q1code, then call codedebugQueuecode Again and it prints the contents of the queue.  So I am confused as why it will print the second queue twice, but not the first queue. Any thoughtsp

Negative 5166 pIm looking to loop through a query, and would like to use grouping, like one would using codecfoutputcode. I know CF10 added that support, but is there a script that emulates that behaviour so that items can be iterated easilyp  hr  pstrongEditstrong There are ways of getting around the lack of grouping in codecfloopcode, by rearranging codecfoutputcode tags, so they are not nested. The reason Im looking for the codecfloopcode workaround is that when nesting codecfoutputcode, you need to use the results from the same query. Id like to use my own QoQ and loop through the result. p

Negative 5166 pJust starting out developing some android apps. Coming from a web development background Im wondering if the idea behind changing whats displayed on screen is similar to linking html files.p  pSay I had a button that once clicked would then display a completely new page, button gone and completely new content in its place. I had thought at first that this was done just by having conditional statements in the main activity class. But I dont see how this would work with the xml layout file.p  pSo I have come to the conclusion that you have to define multiple xml files and switch between them using logic in the main class.p  pIf this is correct whats the best way to go about this, and if not could some suggest how this is achieved normallyp  pThanks.p

The basic idea is that at some timed interval something e.g. a sensor reports a value e.g. temperature to the server. The server records this value into a database. There would be a webbased UI that allows me to view this data on a timebased graph. Ideally this graph would have various resolutions last 30 seconds, last week, last year, etc. In a super ideal world, I would be able to zoom into the data for any point in time. p  pThe problem is that the sensors are going to generate enormous amounts of data. For example, a sensor that reports a value every 5 seconds will generate about 18k values a day. Im imagining a system that has thousands of sensors. Over time, this becomes lots of data. p  pThe naive solution is to throw this data into a relational database and retrieve it in the various ways I want, but that wont scale. p  pThe simple solution is to reduce the amount of data by performing periodic rollups of the data. New data might go into a table that has data points every 5 seconds. Every hour, some system pumps this data into another table that has data points every minute and the original data is deleted. This repeats for a few levels. The downside to this is that the further back in time you go, the less detailed the data is. Thats probably fine. I would imagine that I would need enormous amounts of hardware to support full resolution of data over all time as compared to a system with this sort of rollup.  p  pIs there a better way to do this Is there an existing solution I have to imagine this is a fairly common problem. p

Negative 5166 pMy team has been writing a dashboard application using Node.js, Twitter Boostrap, Mongo DB, and Mule for an ESB.p  pRecently an executive asked us to change our approach to a PortalPortlet container like Liferay.p  pSome of us on the team have experience with Liferay, and we have pretty negative feelings about it.  Dealing with things like fullpage refreshes, portlet lifecycles, style and theming issues, and limited DBMS coverage are at the top of our list of complaints.p  pWe see where our executive team is coming from.  They have decided that they want to make the dashboard extensible and easy or easier to plug into for other groups.p  pIs there a solution out there which can balance the modern web expectations of users with the enterprise needs of IT professionals and executives concerned with building and extensible application with something like Liferay  Pluggable widgets are important here.p  pNode would obviously be our preference with something like Grails as a close second.p  pThanks,p

Negative 5166 pI am using Google Maps V2, and need to call a method when ever the user moves the map.  I am using .setOnCameraChangedListener which fires every time the map is moved. From this event listener, i can call my method. p  pThe problem is that, if user moves the map very slowly, the event is triggered multiple times within a second. The method I call from the event is however time consuming, and I dont want it to be called so frequently. p  pHow can I maintain a timer that keeps pushing the delay say 300ms further until the user really stops interacting with the map. This way my method will be called after 300ms of the last time the event was triggered.p  pIve tried, synchronized, asyncTask by using .cancel and .start over and over again, but nothing seems to work out quite well.p

Negative 5166 pSo Im playing around with dropbox.js. In the Getting Started guide on github the code snippet for signing in isp  precodeclient.authenticatefunctionerror, client    if error       Replace with a call to your own errorhandling code.           Dont forget to return from the callback, so you dont execute the code      that assumes everything went well.     return showErrorerror        Replace with a call to your own application code.       The user authorized your app, and everything went well.    client is a Dropbox.Client instance that you can use to make API calls.   doSomethingCoolclient  codepre  pBackgroundIm using the Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect driver, so upon calling client.authenticate the user gets whisked away to the Dropbox signin page, signs in, authorizes my app, and is then redirected back to the page the whole process started from.p  pHowever my doSomethingCool method or indeed, any part of the callback passed to authenticate is totally ignored after signing in to Dropbox and the redirect back to my page. p  pHowever, if the user is emalreadyem signed in to Dropbox when authenticate is called, dropbox.js does not whisk them away to dropbox.com I guess it just internally verifies that the current session is valid, but the callback and doSomethingCool does get executedp  pThe actual thing I want to do is this on my page, the user is selecting a method of backing storage for a webapp. Once they sign in to Dropbox and theyre redirected back to my page, I actually want them to go to the main part of the app, not this little selector screen. There doesnt appear to be a method to specify a different return address after the dropbox sign in, so I was going to do it manually using window.location.replace in authenticates callback. But it doesnt work  p  pOne alternative would be to send a flag to my domain using AJAX, before calling client.authenticate  to indicate a user is in the OAuth flow. Then when my selector screen gets requested again from my server via the redirect after the dropbox sign in, do an auto redirect to the main app. But its a bit messy nop
Negative 5166 pSo this is quite interesting to me. Ive got the following example markupp  precodelta hreftest.htmlgt   lth2gtHello Worldlth2gt   ltdivgt     ltpgtHello againltpgt   ltdivgt ltagt codepre  pWhen I have my Google Chrome Version 26 rendering this, it shows me exactly this markup. But when I add an anchor inside the div like thisp  precodelta hreftest.htmlgt   lth2gtHello Worldlth2gt   ltdivgt     ltpgtHello againltpgt     lta hrefsomethingelsegtltagt   ltdivgt ltagt codepre  pThe browser outputs the followingp  precodelta hreftest.htmlgt   lth2gtHello Worldlth2gt   ltagt ltdivgt   lta hreftest.htmlgt     ltpgtHello againltpgt   ltagt   lta hrefsomethingelsegtltagt ltdivgt codepre  pSo this is absolutely not what I want. I can imagine it might makes sense in order to be able to click the inner link, that the anchors are only applied to some elements, but I would need it just how i wrote it there. It makes sense, because I have to copy the inner div to another position via JavaScript. But when I do that, the code is already messed up and shows the first link.p  pDoes anybody know how to deal with thisp  pMany thanks in advancep
Negative 5166 pMy query both below return inconsistent sorting results as I increment pages ex. LIMIT 3,3 to LIMIT 4,3.

Negative 5166 pI have been using bitmap fonts with OpenGL.  Its a basic scheme that uses kerning information and does para layout.  I would like to know if I can get kerning information of fonts through CoreText, so that I can continue using OpenGL for my text rendering.   It appears that in CoreText you can specify a string, gets its glyphs and the advances for the glyphs.  Then I imagine one can back calculate the glyphs for specific kernings. But what I would like is all the kerning pairs.br The brute force would be to create a really long string of all possible character pairs, which would be more than a mile long, and then have the advances from CoreText and back calculate the kerning information.  But if there were a direct way to get kerning that would less messy, I would like that.  I know on Windows you can do this, but I was hoping something similar were available in CoreText or Quartz.  p

Negative 5166 pI am running Linux kernel 3.3 on Xilinxs Microblaze with full MMU. the task that I am doing requires me to know the following I need to create a text file buffer and locate the physical address of this buffer and I dont want the kernel to write this file into discontinuous regions of memory.p  pthe reason I need this because I have a DMA engine that streams data from a preset physical memory address, so I need to force Linux to create the buffer file at that exact memory location, so that when I write data into this file its immediately transmitted by the DMA Engine to another Hardware core p  pMore detailsp  pmy system has a 512 MB DDR3 RAM connected to the system via Xilinx multi port memory controller MPMC. the base address of this memory controller is 0x90000000, all units in the system access memory through this controller, including MicroBlaze, The DMA unit that I have uses a special interface called Native Personality Interface NPI to communicate with memory at a very low level, thus resulting a very high speed performance. p  pThis NPI DMA unit was originally designed to be utilized under a very basic embedded kernel called xilkernel which did not support virtual memory, neither MMU was part of MicroBlaze, so the programmer could see where the OS code will reside and select a physical memory address such as 0x91800000 as the source address which DMA will stream from, then the programmer can place a file in that exact address and run the systemp  pwhen we needed to the migrate the project to use Linux instead of xilkernel we ran into this issue, I have files on an external storage device which I can access as block device from Linux and I need move each file to main memory DDR3 RAM and make the DMA stream the file. currently the DMA streams from a fixed address but I can make it generic if needed.p
Negative 5166 pa hrefhttpsgithub.comaddrumTextGame relnofollowhttpsgithub.comaddrumTextGameap  pSo I have this game. What I have achieved so far is that if the user inputs a correct response it returns the next message for them to then figure out what to do from an array. What I need to achieve now is that the program returns a different message depending on what their input is. i.e go left, you reach a door, go right, you pick up a key. I am so confused about how to do this. I thought about grouping messages together at a particular point. So you reach crossroads  and the outputs for go left, go right and go forward are in an array together but then I dont know how to get the program to get the next group of messages. I also had the idea of making the correct input have the index of [0] so that I can then return the current group of messages index of [0] to match that up but this also confused me. If I can make it any clear just ask because I have no easy way of explaining this. Any help would be appreciatedp
Negative 5166 pfor one my classes I am supposed to write a program that implements a differential equation to find the temperature of a 100 degree rod where both ends are dipped in an ice bath. The difference equation is given to solve it. I have an array that is split in the x direction as the segments of the rod and in the y direction as the iterations of time. An r value determines the speed at which the rod cools. It might be worth noting that how the actual program is implemented isnt that important, this program is meant to run on a computer cluster and the point of the assignment is to introduce us to the issuing of jobs on the cluster. The program still has to be correct though obviously, and I cant even get to that point.p  pIm having trouble with my program, because my array seems to start getting garbage data at seemingly random points in the time iterations. I have Netbeans and have tried debugging this but the last time I did it I could not peek into the different elements of the array variable making the debugging process practically useless and now I can even get it to stop at my break point.

Negative 5166 pI work on a project that sits on a largeish pile of raw data, aggregates from which are used to power a publicfacing informational site some simple aggregates like various totals and toptens of totals, and some somewhatmorecomplicated aggregates.  At present we update it once every few months, which involves adding new data, and possibly updating or deleting existing records, and rerunning all the aggregation offline, after which new aggregates are deployed to production.p  pWere interested in ramping up the frequency of updates, such that reaggregating everything from scratch isnt practical, so wed like to do rolling aggregation that updates the existing aggregates to reflect new, changed, or deleted records.p  pCouchDBs MapReduce implementation offers roughly the facility that Im looking for it stores the intermediate state of MapReduce tasks in a big Btree, where the output of maps is at the leaves, and reduce operations gradually join branches together.  New, updated, or deleted records cause subtrees to be marked as dirty and recomputed, but only the relevant portions of the reduce tree need to be touched, and intermediate results from nondirty subtrees can be reused as is.p  pFor a variety of reasons, though uncertainty about CouchDBs future, lack of convenient support for nonMR oneoff queries, current SQLheavy implementation, etc., wed prefer not to use CouchDB for this project, so Im looking for other implementations of this kind of treeish incremental mapreduce strategy possibly, but not necessarily, atop Hadoop or similar.p  pTo preempt some possible responsesp  ul liIm aware of MongoDBs supposed support for incremental MapReduce its not the real thing, in my opinion, because it really only works well for additions to the dataset, not updates or deletes.li liIm also aware of the a hrefhttpwww.cl.cam.ac.ukey204teachingACSR20220122013papersS4ProgrammingpapersbhatotiaSOCC2011.pdf relnofollowIncoopa paper.

Too tedious.p  pHow can I use a particular key, etc to connect to a specific server onlyp  pI tried putting my files likep  ul licode.sshidrsacode  home private keyli licode.sshidrsa.pubcode  home public keyli licode.sshconfigcode  config file like above but with IdentityFile enabledli licode.sshacmeidrsacode  work private keyli licode.sshacmeidrsa.pubcode  work public keyli ul  pI thought that having a config file with IndentityFile should make ssh to use a particular key  in this case pointing to code.sshacmeidrsacode for that particular host, but I always get strongPermission Denied Connection closed by remote hoststrong.p  pAm I missing something Perhaps do I need to supply the public key somewhere else toop  pI checked .sshauthorizedkeys file in the VM and I have a sshrsa entry for the workcomputer not the home computer which Is I believe normal since I am using the keys provided by work.p  pHow come codeIdentityFile .sshacmeidrsacode is not working as expected Do I really need to interchange my homework keys everytime I need to connect to somewhere I am almost a beginner in ssh things, but something tells me there must be a clever way of doing this.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 5166 pIm working in an environment where data exists on numerous client databases and one by one is pulled into a central data repository via sql.p  pTo automate a testing process, Ive written a really nice, streamlined pushbutton script that backups, purges and reextracts data on a userspecified client database. Change a few parameters and hit run and it just works. The script will be handed off to semitechnical staff so simplicity is a must.p  pI have one problem though. The script makes heavy use of dynamically generated synonyms that map to remote tables via a linked server. A few of these tables are backup tables created by the script.p  pWhat Im discovering is, if one of the scriptcreated backup tables is dropped or the database copy is refreshed overnight while the synonym to the backup still exists on the central server, the script will fail with the following errorp  blockquote   pThe OLE DB provider SQLNCLI10 for linked server [linkedservername]   does not contain the table   [databasename].[schemaname].[backuptablename]. The table   either does not exist or the current user does not have permissions on   that table.p blockquote  pAt compile time, SQL Server is checking behind each synonym referenced in the script for a valid destination object table. Is there a way to prevent SQL Server from doing this, similar to how stored procedures no longer require database objects to exist in order to be createdp  pNote that I do have a flag that determines whether or not to drop synonyms at the end of the script to make debugginginvestigations easier, that is why these synonyms may sometimes remain on the server. However, the script preemptively drops every synonym before creating it to ensure that no leftover synonym is accidentally used.p  pBut because the error occurs at script compile time, it never gets a chance to drop old synonyms. In fact, not a single line of of the script gets executed. So its not even a case where I could purge all of the synonyms in the beginning of the script.p  pIs there a way to turn off synonym compilation checking I would like to keep this a single doeverything script that requires no user intervention or troubleshooting.p

Negative 5166 pSo Im working on WP8 app and Im trying to figure out to get my LongListSelector to show custom groups. Basically what I have is a section where messages will be displayed but messages can be generated from 2 different places in the web application so they need to be grouped in the appropriate categories Alerts and BTRs. I tried going through the example code that is on MSDN but since its only in C Im getting stuck on certain parts and right now my LLS is only showing one item from the list. I think it has something to do with me not using the AlphaKeyGroup that is referenced in the example but again I cant really use it since Im not sorting by a character in the messages but instead theres an type value that is passed from the Webservice.

First  this seems to work fine with SEO enabled as the path is still the same, however, when SEO is enabled, customers are able to view products outside of the category they are assigned to. For example, normally a customer would click on the category Acura then Acura CL and the URL would be a hrefhttpwww.XYZ.comAcura20Performance20ChipsAcura20CL relnofollowhttpwww.XYZ.comAcura20Performance20ChipsAcura20CLa where the path would be 999 for example. When using the code above, the content within the PHP tags will be displayed. However, when SEO is enabled, the customer can also find the product directly via the URL a hrefhttpwww.XYZ.comAcuraCL relnofollowhttpwww.XYZ.comAcuraCLa. If the customer views the product via this URL the content within the PHP tags is visible, not hidden.p  pIn short, it seems as if the content is being displayed when no path is assigned viewing the product directly versus viewing through its parent category. Im lost how to fix this, please advise. This is a shop that is heavily modified so any extension recommendations will be ignored as were not willing to take the risk of installing modifications that could potentially cause further issues.p

Negative 5166 pIm trying to write the following, 2 part program. In one file root.c, I read in a random string of 1s and 0s. I then split the resulting string in half, and send each half to its own process through fork. Each child process uses execl to run the second program bitcount.c. p  pWithin bitcount.c, it   a checks if the length of the halfstring is 2 or less. If yes, it returns the number ofbr 1s and 0s to its parent process.   b if not, it begins to recursively split the string in half, and sending each half to its own new process replicating the procedure in root.c. This creates a binary process tree, until all pieces of the string are 2 characters long or less.    c the count results of the left and right children are aggregated by the parent, and returned to its parent, until returning to the root process, which aggregates the highest two children, and outputs it to the user. p  pMy problem with this project is returning the 2character counts to the parent. My idea right now is to direct the parents left and right read pipes to stdin with dup2, and just to print to stdout with fprintf from the children. The select function of the parent should catch the returning output, right p  pMy second problem is the format of the output. if the counts are in ints, what is the best way to return that using select in this case Ive attached my code below, just be warned that it may be a mess  Im rusty with C code and this is my first exposure to select and execl.p  proot.c p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]  if argc  2      perrorinput file name     printfd, argc     exit1   FILE fp iffp  fopenargv[1], r  NULL      perroropen file  fseekfp, 0, SEEKEND long fsize  ftellfp fseekfp, 0, SEEKSET  char bits  mallocfsize1 freadbits, fsize, 1, fp fclosefp   char lefthalf  malloc fsize2  1  char righthalf if fsize2 righthalf  malloc fsize2  2  else righthalf  malloc fsize2  1   if lefthalf  righthalf perrorarray split memcpylefthalf, bits, fsize2 if fsize2 memcpyrighthalf, bits  fsize2, fsize2  1 else memcpyrighthalf, bits  fsize2, fsize2   int fdleft[2], fdright[2] int zero, one int leftres, rightres pidt left, right struct timeval tv fdset readfds  tv.tvsec  2 tv.tvusec  500000  if pipefdleft  1  pipefdright  1          perrorCreate pipe error          exit1    FDZEROampreadfds FDSETfdleft[0], ampreadfds FDSETfdright[0], ampreadfds  if leftfork  0          closefdleft[0]         execl.bitcount, bitcount, lefthalf, NULL         perrorinitiating recursion          exit1  else ifleft gt 0      if right  fork0          closefdright[0]         execl.bitcount, bitcount, righthalf, NULL         perrorinitiating recursion          exit1          else if right gt 0           closefdright[1]         closefdleft[1]         char left         char right         dup2fdleft[0], 0         dup2fdright[0], 0          int ret  select2, ampreadfds, NULL, NULL, amptv         readfdleft[0], ampleftres, 1         readfdright[0], amprightres, 1                    printfBack in root processn            zero  rightres  leftres one  leftressizeofint  rightressizeofint  printfs had d zeroes and d onesn, argv[1], zero, one return 0  codepre  pbitcount.c only relevant partp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]  if argc  2      perrorsent bit string     printfd, argc     exit1  char bitstring  argv[1] int size  strlenbitstring int counts[2] counts[0]  0 counts[1]  0 if size gt 2       int i0     for i lt size i          if bitstring[i]1 counts[1]         else counts[0]            fprintfstdout, p, ampcounts     fflushstdout     return 0      codepre
Negative 5166 pI have a model association that works as followedp  precodeUsers hasAndBelongsToMany Tags codepre  pI want to be able to paginate a group of users based on their tags. Users can have many tags and filter requested can be complex i.e. a query can ask for all the users with tags codeAcode and codeBcode but not codeCcode. Its way more manageable to handle this by using pagination on tags so that the condiditions array can apply to the Tag model and getting back the users that are within that tags subset.p  pThe issue then comes when trying to paginate, because I set up the pagination as followedp  precodethisgtpaginate  array     conditions gt conditions,      contain gt arrayUser,      limit gt 5,    thisgtpaginateTag codepre  pSo then pagination does exactly what is expected, it returns the array for pagination based on tags, but what I want is to paginate by the users. Switching the pagination to hinge on the users creates its own set of problems that is what I was using before. Just pagination exist for model relates like this I feel like this is the type of thing cakephp might be able to do. Thank you to anyone who helps.p
Negative 5166 pIm hoping someone has some experience with asynchronous testing and how to accomplish it with Jmeter.  If someone does know, but not with jmeter, also open to other options, but more familiar with jmeter and the context is for loadstress testing.p  pDefinition For example, sending raw TCP textual datastreams where the session id is within the datastream itself.  Everything is asynchronous and could be outoforder as far as returns.p  pExample So, given a sample of 10 datastreams with an end signal of n over 5 threads, it is possible for all 10 to be sent over the same TCP port before the first one responds, and the response could be in any order.p  psession00001datasentherenp  psession00002datalsosentherenp  psession00003differentdatanp  p...p  psession00010moredifferentdatanp  pUsing Jmeter, I do want to measure how long it takes for each given datastream based on the sessionid say data bytes 812 of the streams in this example to return.  The intent is to use Jmeter for what it is good at, loadstress testing across multiple machines, but smart enough to understand the asynch TCP data opposed to your normal HTTP session requestresponse.p  pConstraint is during any given testing session the sessionid is unique at least until a response stream is returned for logistic reasons, otherwise couldnt pull this off .p  pThanks in advance, and just to ensure intent is understood, this is to take advantage of all the nice readytogo reportslistenerspluginsanalytics available to Jmeter.p  pEDIT The implementation of the server under test is Netty, not dissimilar to the Telnet example.  If there is a Jmeter example of testing the Netty example Telnet server that may also help.p  pDp

Negative 5166 pSometimes my QProgressDialog shows, sometimes it doesnt ever show at all as if processEvents werent called. Are there any artifacts of the processEvents command that may cause the QProgressDialog not to show under certain circumstancesp  pMy question is general because I have not yet been able to isolate the problem in my code. However, I have noticed that when my QProgressDialog does not show it occurs when I am accessing a text file using a config parser. The work around was to do a time.sleep after the file has been closed perhaps to ensure the process completed and that processEvents would then commence showing the QProgressDialog.p  pIf it helps, heres my code for running the QProgressDialog as a generatorp  precodedef progressdialogself, data, label, windowtitle, stoplabel, capturebarFalse     bar  QProgressDialoglabel, stoplabel, 0, lendata     if capturebar self.progbar  bar     bar.setWindowTitlewindowtitle     for k, d in enumeratedata         QCoreApplication.instance.processEvents         if bar.wasCanceled             raise GeneratorExit          set the next value beyond the start of 0         bar.setValuek1          again process events to draw the new label and value         QCoreApplication.instance.processEvents         yieldd         raise StopIteration codepre  pAgain, sorry I dont have a full code snippet of the isolated problem and the full code is too big of an ocean. I guess what Im looking for is a why of checking if the processEvents command is doing its job because clearly I am calling it but it hangs on other processes rather than showing the dialog.p  pEditp  pAccording to this support request doing a bar.show command will force the progress bar to show.p  pa hrefhttpredmine.smar.fiissues265 relnofollowhttpredmine.smar.fiissues265ap  pIm going to wait a few weeks and make sure this is a guaranteed fix before posting it as an answer.p

Both should be in polynomial time.p
Negative 5166 pI am looking to make a slideshow using Jekyll but would like to have the slideshow be a single post alongside regular blog posts. I found a few Jekyll themed slideshows using impress.js a hrefhttpsgithub.combmcmurrayhekyll relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpsgithub.combcaccinolojekyllimpressjsplugin relnofollowherea, but in the examples for both they are relying on a single static html file that simply pulls all of the posts from the posts folder. I can filter out the nonslideshow posts by class, but that would not solve the situation of having two slideshows as slides from both would be pulled in.p  pIs there a way of passing information from the slide post eg a Title that can be read in the static html file to determine which posts belong to this slideshow Alternatively, is there a different way to go about doing thisp

Negative 5166 pSorry for posting a rather vague question here  but Ive been struggling to find a definitive answer to this one  maybe there is none, but just thought asking fellow developers.p  pLast week, a colleague of mine mentioned that the length of constructors In Java and in OOP in general should be kept to a minimum. While I do agree the approach in general, he went on to say that it should be only a few lines  34 lines at maximum. p  pIm not sure how he arrived at this number and I wonder how useful that approach is. If you have some complex initialisation to perform, your constructors will exceed that limit.  You can split and break and refactor your code into smaller functions till cows come home, I prefer to keep related code into one method and avoid unnecessary functions as it makes code more readable. This at times does lead to situations where constructors are fairly moderate in size  50100 lines of code in worst scenarios, but then even if I break it up into functions, technically speaking, that code is still called as part of initialisation. So, 100 lines of code might be replaced by a single function call, but that 100 lines still get called when you call the function I also looked at checks type default definitions and it has default constructor length set to 150, which sounds more reasonable Than a few lines code.p  pWould love to know what you guys follow as rule of thumb or if there is, indeed, such a accepted upon limit.p

Negative 5166 pI have several domain classes for which the user interface includes a duplicate command. As part of the implementation of those commands, I have implemented codeclonecode methods in the corresponding domain classes.p  pI have been trying to correct my bad habit of improperly implementing clone in general based on use of codenewcode rather than codesuper.clone,code so as soon as I thought about doing the same for my Grails domain classes, I wondered how using codesuper.clonecode to obtain a clone might interact with codeGORMcode  Hibernate persistence.

If I simply codesuper.clonecode, do nothing further and later try to codesavecode the cloned instance, will it work properly creating a new persistence entry or will some kind of error or silent failure resultp  pWhat is the proper or preferred way to duplicate a Grails domain instancep

Negative 5166 pCan some please, PLEASE help me with this problem. Okay so I have a code that at first I thought worked well but I forgot that when the default codeltimg srctestimg1.jpg classactualimggtcode content is loaded the first of the three buttons below the image should take the active css state that Ive specified for the active buttons to take. Now what I want is for this little code to behave like a normal slider by loading in the css hidden contents into the .imagearea div and it works when I click on the buttons. Problems only surface when I am I trying to give the first loaded content an active state. One way I believe can fix this I cant implement it is to let the first immediate default content be this inline hidden div  code     ltdiv idimagearea2gt       ltdiv classimgareawrappergt         ltimg srctestimg2.jpg classactualimggt       ltdivgt     ltdivgtcode while somehow letting the first button be set to active.

All the SRK are in coulmn1 of FileA and all the MRS are in coulmn2 of FileA. Any of the SRK and MRS may have multiple DMN values given in FileB. What I actually want in my FileC is all the possible pairing of the values of SRK and MRS belongs to one row of FileA. For example the first row in FileA is SRK00017  MRS10904.1 and if we will look at FileB SRK00017 has three DMN values DMN03028.10, DMN03029.10, DMN00069.20 and the MRS10904.1 also has two DMN values DMN02113.10 and DMN00659.13. So for the first row of FileA there will have 32  6 possible pairs of DMN. There are in the first six lines of resultant FileC.txt. I hope I am able to convey my question.p

Negative 5166 pIm working on an app that uses CoreData alongside a server API. Im simplifying a bit, but the tricky part is that when I update a relationship add or remove an object from the relationship, besides saving this to CD, I also need to send separate HTTP requests to the server to add or delete such objects.p  pFor instance Im obviously skipping the JSON lt CD parsing aspect of this, say Ip  ol liretrieve from the server object codeOcode with relationship codeRcode tomany initially holding another object coder0code. So that after a fetch to the server, my main context holds codeO.R  [r0]code.li liI then remove coder0code and add coder1code. Now the main context holds codeO.R  [r1]code.li ol  pCurrently, what I do when I want to commit this back to the backing SQL in the app and also the server is dispatching an async block on a private GCD queue. The blockp  ol liCreates a temp context that only shares the store coordinator with the main context.li liretrieves the saved in the SQL db version of object codeOcode by codeObjectIDcode using the temp context.li liDoes a diff by codeObjectIDcode between the elements in the version of codeOcode in the main context and the version just retrieved via the temp context. In this way I can tell that the version just retrieved via the temp context has codeO.R  [r0]code, while the current version from the main context has codeO.R  [r1]code.li liFrom the above, I know I have to issue one call to delete coder0code from the server and another to add coder1code.li liLast, I save the main context, since as far as CoreData is concerned, codeO.R  [r1]code is indeed the new state. remember that figuring out what was deleted and what was added on a perobject basis is only necessary for the server update.li ol  pNow the problem is, that I want to do this using child contexts and codeperfromBlockcode instead. But if I create a child context of the main context instead of a temp context that only shares the store coordinator with the main context, I cant seem to find a way to access the old version of the object in question from the SQL. That is, after the change, the main context has codeO.R  [r1]code. And if I fetch the same object via the child context by id, I also get that codeO.R  [r1]code. Also, I tried calling coderefreshObjectcode on the child context to see if this would force the child to refetch from the SQL, but it still reflects the current state of the main context. I think this has to do with a cache that I dont know how to clear.p  pPoint being, is there a way to force the child context to fetch from the persistent store instead of the cache Or is there another way to fetch the old state of the object in questionp  pBTW, neither codechangedValuescode nor codechangedValuesForCurrentEventscode seem to do the trick either.p

Negative 5166 pI have an Eclipse product defined in a plugin  it does not define its own Application class i.e. no custom implementation of IApplication. I am using some dynamic dropdown items in the main toolbar, defined in plugin.xml. I am building the Product using the Eclipse 4.3 Kepler platform.p  pAt runtime, I would like the toolbar items to show which of the dropdown items are currently selected. For generic items, I use an icon, but for nongeneric items I would like to show some identifying text. The identifying text is not always of the same length. p  pI am using an IElementUpdater to update the dropdown items and also the toolbar item. Everything works fine, except that the coolbartoolbartrimbar does not relayout. If the new text is longer than the text it is replacing, or if I switch from icon to text or viceversa, the toolbar appears empty  not even the dropdown arrow is showing. My test team reports that the Dropdown tool item disappears, which is a pretty good description of the experience.p  pIs there any way to force the main toolbarcoolbartrimbar complex relayoutp  pI have done some research and it seems that I might be able to do this by defining my own IApplication implementation and capturing the CoolbarToolbar manager using an ActionBarAdvisor subclass for later calls to layout.

Negative 5166 pIm building a system where I need to assign users access to a specific individual number of assets. These assets potentially numbering  in the tens of thousands.p  pI thought to do it with bitwise comparisons, so something like storing the value of 3 if a user has access to assets 1 and 2, a value of 7 for access to 1, 2 and 3, etc. etc.p  pThe access is not necessarily sequential, so a user could easily have access to assets 10, 12 and 24324.p  pI quickly ran into a problem using bits where the server wouldnt pick up assets beyond the 63rd bit, so obviously Ive either misunderstood something, or bits is a dumb way to store this kind of info.p  pMy code, running on a 64bit Linux system, is this just for testing purposes obviously, to discover just such limitations as thisp  precodeltphp  bitwise  GET[bitwise]  if issetbitwise       echo ltbrgtbitwise input      echo bitwise     bitcount  0     for i1iltbitwisei2           if i amp bitwise gt 0               bitcount             echo ltbrgtbitcount  . i .  is in  . bitwise                   codepre  pp  pAnd I input test values via the querystring. However, no matter what value I input, the maximum count I can get to is 63.p  pSo, my question is Is this simply because Im using bitwise comparisons for something theyre not ideal for my theory, or is my implementation of it just wrongp  pMy next goto solution would be to store the bits in arrays, so if someone has access to assets 1, 2 and 3 Ill store their list as [1,2,3]. Its unlikely that someone has access to more than, say, a hundred specific assets. Is this a reasonable way to do it I realize this puts the question somewhat into discussionworthy territory, but hopefully its still specific enough.p  pParamount concerns are, of course, performance if the server has to serve a large number of clients at the same time.p  pplease excuse wrong terminology where applicable, hopefully my meaning is clear.p

Negative 5166 pIm trying to build the Boost C libraries in 32bit form on a 64bit linux machine. After running bootstrap.sh, I runp  precode.b2 addressmodel32 codepre  pAll I get as output is a load of g output saying compilation terminated. and a result of no libraries compiled, all skipped. This is extremely frustrating for me as I cant find anyone else who is having the same issue. All answers seem to point to using the addressmodel32 option which doesnt work at all for me.p  pIf i specify no options and just runp  precode.b2 codepre  pThen all is well and the build is successful. But surly this builds 64bit libraries Which is not what I want when my target is 32bit systems.p  pIm using Ubuntu 13.10 64bit and trying to build Boost 1.55.0.p  pAny help is appreciated. Thanksp

The files I am accessing are tabdelimited datasheets saved as emem.xls so theyre opened automatically by Excel when doubleclicked.p  pInside the sheet there are various dates in the format ddMMyyyy, and when the file is opened normally double clicked, rightclick open, etc via Excel 2003 required version, the dates are interpreted as such. When I attempt to open the file using the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel 14.0.4756.1000 library however, i.e. invoke via c using the following syntaxp  precodeeitbook  eitbooks.OpentargetFile.FullName, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,          Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,         Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,          Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing codepre  pthe dates have their day and month switched, and all date math done in the aforementioned macros is done incorrectly. As well as any dates where the day is greater than 12 are not even recognized as datesp  pI.E. 04012012 becomes 01042012, this is presumably because the system has its regional settings set to English United States, but Ive made sure that the systems Regional Settings Short Date format is set to a custom value that matches the data in the spreadsheet ddMMyyyy, and the problem only seems to occurs when the sheet is opened using the code above.p  pAny help would be very much appreciated. Thanks.p  pedit The Operating System of the computer opening the files is Windows XP.p

Negative 5166 pThis is not your typical merge. I basically have 2 or more collections i need to merge and the order of the items is important.

Extra items can be added in between but the order must be the same.p  pi know this is a strange case but it is for code generation where the order of the properties on the class is must be in a particular order so they get serialised out in the same order them came in.  If a property is not populated then it will not be serialised out so that is why i can add items inbetween but not change the order. To easily compare input to output in an automated fashion i need them coming out in the same order they went in otherwise it would require manual testing which i dont want to do  p  p edit p  pTrying to explain it a bit better.p  pAll i can check is if an item in one list equals an item in another list.  These items will be objects not numbers like above and cant be sorted on their contents. The sortingordering is based on the order of items relative to items that are in both lists. The only way you can do this is to know that one list is 100 ordered correctly and the second list is a merge so may have things out of order.  My source lists will always been in the same order so can trust them as the point of truth when there is a conflict due to a earlier merge.p  pI am also working on some possible solutions but no luck yetp

Negative 5166 pAs I understand it, curl uses the cookiefile parameter to read the cookies, and cookiejar to save them once the curl session is completed.p  pTypical examples for using this indicate a file must be used, but I dont want to need manual cleanup of these leftover bits. For example, if I set the cookiejar to a file using tempnam, I will inevitably end up with a directory full of little cookiejars that I will need to clean up.p  pIF the user properly logs out, I can of course delete this temp file, but Im counting on a majority of the users just closing the browser window and the session eventually expiring, leaving me with no way to delete the cookie jar automatically.p  pMy best idea thus far is to splash a cookiejar into the temp folder, read it into a session variable, and then delete the cookiejar file every time curl is used.p  pPrevious users implementations is to obviate the cookiejar by parsing header information, but this is a little more involved that I want to get.p

Negative 5166 pI use Vim to write my code.texcode files, but I am having trouble with the spell checker in Vim.  Sometimes it does not check the words, and I think that it might be for the following reason.p  pSince Vim is clearly not supposed to check all of the words in the code.texcode document, for example, not the preamble, it only check spelling in certain regions in the syntax sense.  As I have gathered from a hrefhttpvim.1045645.n5.nabble.comSpellcheckerdoesntworkinalllatexfilestd5718129.htmlherea, one of these regions is codetexSectionZonecode.  These regions can become quite large, indeed a section often is, so Vim is having trouble realising that it actually is in a codetexSectionZonecode region or in ay other, and therefore does not check the spelling.  This can happen if I make a search in the document, or any kind of jump that skips multiple lines or rather pages.p  pThe way that I concluded this might be the reason is the following  I know that the commandp  precodeecho synIDattrsynIDline.,col.,1,name codepre  pprints the name of the regionregions you are in I found it a hrefhttpvim.wikia.comwikiIdentifythesyntaxhighlightinggroupusedatthecursorherea, so when the spell checker did not work I tried this, and it told me that it was not in any region at all.  The places it did work, I was in a region where it ought to check the spelling.p  pSo far my only solution is to find the nearest section above the point I want the speller to check, and then manually move the cursor back down to the given point.p  pIdeally I would very much like a solution that ensures that this does not happen, but I would also settle for a way to manually make vim update which region it is in, without me having to move the cursor a lot.  In the latter case I am thinking of a solution which could be made to a shortcut.p  pPS  I was in doubt about what to call the question.  If you come up with a title which explain the problem better, fell free to change it.p

Firstly, Can I set a model for application route Secondly, if the model for the route has fields named count and fileName, do I need to declare these fields in the controller also. It looks like if I do so, the value in the controller takes precedence over the model value. Also can I do something like codethis.settotal,5code in the codesetupControllercode even though total isnt defined anywhere.     p  precodeApp.ApplicationRouteEmber.Route.extend modelfunction     console.logmodel called     return count3,fileNameDoc1 , setupControllerfunction     console.logthis.getmodel.fileName     this.setcount,this.getmodel.count Do I manually need to do this     this.setfileName,this.getmodel.fileName Do I manually need to do this   App.ApplicationControllerEmber.Controller.extend     count0,Is this necessary Can I directly set the property with declaring it like this     fileName  codepre

Negative 5166 pI have a relatively large web api application, i.e. it currently has 300 tables.p  pThe app is written in such a way that it doesnt use any stored procedures and next to no views, i.e. the business logic is all in the app code. It uses the repository pattern so it is relatively easy to create mock data for our unit tests.p  pHowever, it is quite hard to manage the mock data, and very hard for any given individual to get insight into what data is already there. Weve tried to move the test data into a mock factory, so that it is stored in a single file, which various tests then load as needed i.e. a given test will only require a certain subset of the data, so it will only ask for that subset. p  pStill, the management of the data is quite complex, asserting about the data returned from the application is also fragile. For instance, say that there are defined 10 customers in our mock data, out of which 2 are marked as inactive. We may have a test case which tests that a method which should return all active customers should return 8 instances. However, if a developer must add a new instance to our test data, this will break existing testsasserts.p  pDoes anyone have experience in managing this, or has anything been written about thisp

Negative 5166 pI wrote that nice capability to listen to UDP messages and these are added to a FIFO whenever a new message arrives and that is signaled to a listener.p  pThe listener waits for messages if it has nothing else to do. However, it knows, in some cases, that it should wake up in a very short amount of time. So I wrote code to use the pthreadcondtimedwait and there I put the time which in my current test 1.5 seconds, roughly.p  pIt does wait 1 second, then the wait function does not block anymore.

Negative 5166 pI am using GlassFish 4.0 in a cluster configuration with two nodes and each node has one instance. The DAS and two instances are setup as Window 7 services that use a logon account that has administrator privileges.  Upon starting the machine the service starts and the DAS is up along with the instances. From Windows Task Manager this appears as two java.exe processes per service for a total of 6 java.exes. The problem is that if I use the asadmin restartdomain command two new java.exe processes spawn and the two old ones do not die. The application that is deployed works fine, but with enough restarts using asadmin, the memory starts to fill up from zombie java.exes.  Oddly enough running asadmin stopdomain will stop the two DAS java.exe processes but then running asadmin startdomain starts Glassfish as a nonservice.  The only way to start the DAS back as a service is to run sc start domain1 or restart the machine.  Also, the only way to stop the DAS java.exe processes is with asadmin stopping the service using sc stop domain1 stalls and does not work. It is also odd that each service DAS, instance 1 and 2 starts two java.exes, vs starting only one each when running as a nonservice.p  pIs there any additional service wrapper configuration that needs to be done, or asadmin options that need to be passed in when running asadmin commands on GlassFish 4.0 running as a service p  pThanks, Robertp

Negative 5166 pIm new to BroadcastReceiver and Im currently trying it out.

The program compiles without any warnings or errors. The dowhile loop with the countdown and such works fine. However, if I do press the tilde  key, followed by enter, instead of waiting for the user input from the p  precodescanfc, ampxchoice   codepre  pthe program simply stops running and the terminal just goes back to displaying my current directory. I am writing on Linux for Windows. This is obviously not the intended outcome. Also I did try inserting a loop to make getchar work until enter is pressed and that didnt work either. I also tried using getchar to read a single character in the same way as the above scanf statement, but that had the same outcome. I am sure that I am missing something obvious... but I just cant find it. Lastly, I was wondering if there was some better way to display a lot of text on the screen besides a bunch of putsdjfasjlaksdjp  pThanks a bunchp

It opens a window, you type into it, press return, and then the vim plugin processes its output and navigates to the file  buffer you selected.p  pThe time between triggering the find function and the new process grabbing keyboard input is a fraction of a second, so its possible to accidentally type too soon, which causes that input to be delivered to vim.p  pGiven that vim is singlethreaded, I know and have verified that the errant keyboard input is not actually processed until the program finishes  the input is buffered while the program runs, and afterwards the random keys I typed are interpreted as vim actions.p  h1Questionh1  pstrongHow can I discard input thats sitting in vims input buffer but has not yet been processedstrongp  pcodeinputsavecode takes pending keyboard input and saves it onto a stack.

As an example, I might have a marketing scheme designed for Vehicles, of which a marketing customer for Cars might be a participant.  I have another interface, codeManufacturerltRgt extends MarketingCustomer ltRgtcode, so a manufacturer of cars is also a marketing customer of cars. p My MarketingScheme interface defines a single method, codepublic void addParticipantMarketingCustomerltsuper Tgt customercode. I would expect to be able to add a codeMarketingCustomerltCargtcode to a codeMarketingSchemeltVehiclegtcode, assuming Car was a subclass of Vehicle.

Negative 5166 pI have a weird issue I have no ideea how to fix.p  pIm creating a color picker from scratch. Im doing so by creating a set of user controls and putting them together in a master control.p  pWhen a user drags over the hue picker, for example, I handle the mouse down, move and up inside the hue picker user control.p  pA simple bool dictates what happens, as far as the actual moving goes. p  precodeMouse down  isDrag  true  Mouse Move ifisDrag return  Moving the position indicator shape thingy Calculating the hue  Mouse Up isDrag  false codepre  pBut, if the mouse up occurs outside of the bounds of the hue picker, the mouse up event doesnt fire. Thus, when the user returns to the area of the hue picker, the shape indicator thingy runs rampart.p  pI am certain an answer lies somewhere but Im afraid my searching skills are not up to the task. Ive no idea what to look for. p  pThank you for your time.p  pSolutionp  precodeprivate bool isDrag      Request Mouse capture for the Container     private void MsDownobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e              isDrag  true         Mouse.CaptureMainContainer           Release Mouse capture     private void MsUpobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e              isDrag  false         Mouse.Capturenull           Move the handle vertically along the main container, with respect to its width  so its centered.     private void MsMoveobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if isDrag return         Canvas.SetTopHandle, e.GetPositionContentRow.Y  Handle.ActualHeight  2      codepre  pThank you for your answerp  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pFollowing up on my issue. While Capture basically did the trick, I noticed that, if fast dragging outside the bounds of the user control , sometimes the handle would get stuck close to the edge.

Negative 5166 pI am creating a rails api, and am attempting to keep a modular approach in my controller. As such, I have a few models  codeOrganizationcode, codeBranchcode, codeUsercode.

After a while, I stopped with that, and I moved to codegitsvncode but instead of using it directly from my local PC  I had set up a codemyrepogitsvncode on my local server from it a bare git repo is made on the local server, codemyrepogitLS.gitcode, which is added as a remote origin of the codemyrepogitsvncode. The idea is then that I can work from local PCs in respect to codemyrepogitLS.gitcode, and keep the local network work in sync  even if the svn web server goes temporarily offline.p  pThe below script, a hrefhttpsgist.githubusercontent.comanonymous3a81678c99f14d557a4erawtestrepo.sh relnofollowcodetestrepo.shcodea, simulates this process locally  including the codemyreposvnWScode going offline.

Negative 5166 pI recently started trying out a hrefhttpwww.ractivejs.org relnofollowRactive.jsa. I was particularly interested in its strongcomponentsstrong. One of the things I noticed immediately is that many of the examples are using the codeinitcode option. However when I try to use the codeinitcode in my code I get a deprecation notice and it then recommends using codeonrendercode instead. codeonrendercode however had far fewer examples than codeinitcode and some of the functions such as codethis.findcode werent available inside codeonrendercode. I looked through the Github issues but couldnt find any reasoning behind this change or what the suggested path forward for selecting elements specific to a component was.p  pI created a a hrefhttpcodepen.iowebdessertspengbNwbeeditors101 relnofollowtest pena to try creating a recursive component with the new API but I had to resort to using jQuery and an undocumented codefragmentcode api to select specific DOM nodes I needed to manipulate. I feel this is against how Ractive expects you to do things, but I couldnt figure out what was expected of me with the existing documentation.p  pWhats the major differences between the codeinitcode and codeonrendercode options and how does codeonrendercode expect you to handle manipulating specific elements and their events within a componentp

So a chatroom model might look like codeid, name, users, lastUpdatecodeli liEverytime message is posted, app will also call server to pass in that messageli ul  pBoth methods doesnt seem to correct Is there a better way The first will require the server to listen on all channels.

Negative 5166 pIm rather new to Python and absolutely ignorant of C unfortunately so I am struggling to properly understand some aspects of working with Cython.p  pAfter profiling a Python program and discovering that it was just a couple of loops that were hogging most of the time, I decided to look into dumping them into Cython. Initially, I just let Cython interpret the Python as it was, and the result was a remarkable 2x speed boost. Coolp  pFrom the Python main, I pass the function two 2D arrays a and b and a float, d, and it returns a list, newlist. As examplesp  precodea [[12.7, 13.5, 1.0],[23.4, 43.1, 1.0],...] b [[0.46,0.95,0],[4.56,0.92,0],...] d  0.1 codepre  pHere is the original code, with just the cdefs added for Cythonp  precodedef loopa, b, d      cdef int i, j     cdef double x, y      newlist  []      for i in rangelena         if b[i][2]  1             for j in rangei1,lena                 if a[i]  a[j] and b[j][2]  1                     x  b[i][0]b[j][0]                     y  b[i][1]b[j][1]                     b[i][2],b[j][2]  1,1                      if absyabsx gt d                         if y gt 0 newlist.append[a[i][0],a[i][1],y]      return newlist codepre  pIn pure Python, this ran with several tenthousand loops in 12.5s. In Cython it ran in 6.3s. Great progress with nearzero work donep  pHowever, with a little reading, it was clear that much, much more could be done, so I set about trying to apply some type changes to get things going even faster, following the Cython docs, a hrefhttpdocs.cython.orgsrctutorialnumpy.html relnofollow titlehereherea also referenced in the comments. p  pHere are the collected modifications, meant to mimic the Cython docsp  precodeimport numpy as np cimport numpy as np  DtypeA  np.float DtypeB  np.int  ctypedef np.floatt DtypeAt ctypedef np.intt DtypeBt  def loopnp.ndarray[DtypeAt, ndim2] A,          np.ndarray[DtypeAt, ndim2] B,          np.ndarray[DtypeBt, ndim1] C,          float D      cdef Pyssizet i, j     cdef float x, y      cdef np.ndarray[DtypeAt, ndim2] NEWARRAY  np.zeroslenC,3, dtypeDtypeA      for i in rangelenC         if C[i]  1             for j in rangei1,lenC                 if A[i][0]A[j][0] and A[i][1]A[j][1] and C[j] 1                     x  B[i][0]B[j][0]                     y  B[i][1]B[j][1]                     C[i],C[j]  1,1                      if absyabsx gt D                         if y gt 0 NEWARRAY[i][A[i][0],A[i][1],y]      return NEWARRAY codepre  pAmong other things, I split the previous array b into two different input arrays B and C, because each row of b contained 2 float elements and an integer that just acted as a flag. So I removed the flag integers and put them in a separate 1D array, C. So, the inputs now looked liked this p  precodeA [[12.7, 13.5, 1.0],[23.4, 43.1, 1.0],...] B [[0.46,0.95],[4.56,0.92],...] C [0,0,...] D  0.1 codepre  pIdeally, this should go much faster with all the variables now being typed...but obviously Im doing something very wrong, because the function now comes in at a time of 35.3s...way WORSE than the pure Pythonp  pWhat am I botching so badly Thanks for readingp

Negative 5166 pI am working on a remote server that uses Netty to perform client authentication with a TLS handshake through the Netty SSLHandler library. This SO question gives a bit a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9573894setupnettywith2waysslhandsakeclientandservercertificateSet up Netty with 2way SSL Handsake client and server certificateap  pNow, the question I have about this system is that the Server requires a TrustManager to initialize a SSLContext. From what I observe this uses the SunJSSE provider. Now after setting up this implementation, I got it working with RSA client certs. Now, I am having trouble using ECC client certs as SunJSSE cannot recognize them I think Java SE 7 include SunEC as a provider. But SunEC is a SunJCE implementation and not a SunJSSE one and thus cannot be used as a provider for TrustManager. So, how do I proceed. I heard Bouncy Castle can recognize these certs, but I still cannot instantiate a TrustManager with BC as the provider.p  pEdit Also if there is no way to use TrustManagers, should I do the entire handshake only use BouncyCastles APIs and not nettys libraries That seems off though. This is my other SO question that shows the stack trace a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30603680clienteccsslcertificatecontainsunknownnamedcurveClient ECC SSL Certificate contains quotunknown named curvequotap

Negative 5166 pI read in a book that, whenever we declare a variable with the storage class as register, then it would be stored in a register, subject to the its availability. If no register is available, then the default storage type of auto would be assigned to it.p  pWhenever we declare a variable without explicitly mentioning any storage class, then the default storage type assigned to it is auto itself.p  pSo, my question is, bwhy not declare every variable to be of the register storage class  if no register is available, it will anyways be treated as the default auto class itselfb. And luckily, if registers are available, then it would be stored in one. I understand that we cannot use the amp operator any longer, but what if Im bnotb going to work with pointers and addresses Can I declare those variables with the register storage class then Because this seems to be a bad practise.p  pEdit I searched the web, but unavailability of the address is the only point mentioned.

Negative 5166 pI am trying to programmatically retrieve my companys app data from the Google Developers Console, specifically the daily installs. I have found that Google recommends the gsutil tool to access the data programmatically through the Google Cloud Storage SDK. However, I beleive they charge for this service. I want a free way to programmatically retrieve the data, preferably as a JSON stream to avoid dealing with file downloads.  I have found the direct reporting links, but I have problems authenticating when I try to use them, and I also have to do something with the actual files then. p  pIs there a way to get a JSON version of the data through OAuth2 or something without downloading an Excel file Has anyone had to do this Thanks in advance.p

Later I tried exporting the certificates from my browser because my browser handles the certificates just fine and can access the https url. I exported the root certificate into a root.cer file and imported this .cer into my cacerts I had to use a different alias than cert. With cert as alias i got a Keys not matching message in the console when using the keytool prompt.p  pA dump on cacerts shows that there is indeed an entry in cacerts. I dont get why java refuses to do a wsimport on the url.p  pIn the end i just downloaded the url destination onto my machine and did the wsimport on the downloaded .xmlfile and later changed the url parameters in the generated stubs. Doesnt help though, because when i run the application im running into the PKIX...unable to find valid certification path to requested target error. p

But on most of my others I have five other PCs to test it on, although four of these are exactly the same, it was quite fast.p  pSo I wrote a new version, emulating codeINCcode and codeDECcode using codeLEAcode and codeJECXZcode instead, like sop  pemPart of emulating codeemp  precodeMainLoop         MOV     EAX,[ESI  EDXCLimbSize]         LEA     ECX,[ECX  1]                    Avoid INC and DEC, see above.

Negative 5166 pI have spent big time on related questionsanswers in stakcoverflow and android doc from google on about adding or deleting pages at RANDOM positions in FragmentStatePagerAdapter.br It works fine but fails for one scenario.br Scenario1 that worksbr Add, say, 4 pages Fragments.br Delete the page at last position that is at position 3.br Add one more page at the end of page again.br Delete the page at last position that is at position 3.br . I repeat this steps and it works perfectly fine.  p  pBut scenario2 it failsbr Add, say, 4 pages Fragments.br Delete any page other than last position, say, position 2. Works fine.   Page is no more seen.br Add one more page at the end of page again. FAILED here..I see blank page.  p  pI did analyse it to some extent and I could find that getItem is not being called when it failed. As getItem is the one which creates and returns the new fragment so it does not get the new fragment so it shows blank. I saw the implementation of instantiateItem and observed that getItem is not called if the size of the available no of fragments is more than the position requested to create the fragment for. But not sure when it happens or how.p  pHere is my getItem and getItemPosition from my adapter. I have my own set of ArrayList of fragments FragmentStatePagerAdapter maintains its own set of fragment listmFragments is that in the below code. After I call notifyDataItemChanged I observed.    p  precodeOverride public int getItemPositionObject object      if object instanceof InnerFragment          if mFragments.containsobject              Log.dTAG, getItemPosition Frag   object   is REMOVED and item count is   MainFragment.mPager.getChildCount             return POSITIONNONE          else              Log.dTAG, getItemPosition Frag   object   is AVAILABLE and item count is   MainFragment.mPager.getChildCount             Log.dTAG, getItemPosition .....position of this fragment is    mFragments.indexOfobject             return mFragments.indexOfobject                   Log.dTAG, getItemPosition object is not InnerFragment..     return super.getItemPositionobject   Override public Fragment getItemint position      Log.dTAG, getItem for position   position  ..create NEW FRAG and item count is   MainFragment.mPager.getChildCount     return createNewPageposition  codepre  pPlease spare few mins and help me if you get any clue. below is the log snippets.

My code does this For every file in the directory Ctemp  if the file name contains 123 it adds it to a list of strings.p  precodeDim filelist As New ListOf String         Dim tempdirectory As New IO.DirectoryInfoCtemp         Dim getfileinfo As IO.FileInfo  tempdirectory.GetFiles         Dim item As IO.FileInfo         For Each item In getssfnfiles             If item.ToString.Contains123 Then                 filelist.Additem.ToString             End If         Next codepre  pThen, it will do something with each file in a for each statement.p  precodeFor Each filefound in filelist     Do Something Next codepre  pThe error seems to happen on this linep  blockquote   pFor Each filefound in filelistp blockquote  pI dont know why, because like I said, the code works fine when Im not compiling it with CodeDom. Anyone know how to go about fixing this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5166 pThe betamax a hrefhttpfreeside.cobetamaxusage relnofollowdocumentationa seems to imply that the only way betamax can beis meant to be used is through jUnit tests. But I hope thats not the case.p  pI want to use betamax to record the http traffic a user experiences through the browser, effectively doing some sort of mitm style setup to record requests the user made to a website, with the idea that I can start the browser up again in an offline state, and replay those exact same requests. Does Betamax support thisp

Negative 5166 pI am developing a Delphi XE7 application with data stored in an online Mysql database. For the database access I use FireDAC. Because the application can be used on more than one computer simultaneously I need to be notified when a table is changed, so I can update the displayed information on each computer. FireDAC has a component called TFDEventAlerted which sounded like exactly what I need for this. But this component gives an error when activating calling Register [FireDAC][Phys][MySQL]303. Capability is not supported. I am not sure what this means, but after reading more about the component it seems Mysql does not support this type of events If so can anyone tell me whether there is another solution to accomplish the samep  pAny help would be appreciated as I cannot seem to find a good solution.p
