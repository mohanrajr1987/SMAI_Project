Negative 38 pSuppose I have a class Application. In order to be initialised it takes certain settings in the constructor. Lets also assume that the number of settings is so many that its compelling to place them in a class of their own.p  pCompare the following two implementations of this scenario.p  pImplementation 1p  precodeclass Application      ApplicationApplicationSettings settings             Do initialisation here       class ApplicationSettings      Settings related methods and properties here  codepre  pImplementation 2p  precodeclass Application      ApplicationApplication.Settings settings             Do initialisation here         class Settings            Settings related methods and properties here      codepre  pTo me, the second approach is very much preferable. It is more readable because it strongly emphasises the relation between the two classes. When I write code to instantiate Application class anywhere, the second approach is going to look prettier. p  pNow just imagine the Settings class itself in turn had some similarly related class and that class in turn did so too. Go only three such levels and the class naming gets out out of hand in the nonnested case. If you nest, however, things still stay elegant.p  pDespite the above, Ive read people saying on StackOverflow that nested classes are justified only if theyre not visible to the outside world that is if they are used only for the internal implementation of the containing class. The commonly cited objection is bloating the size of containing classs source file, but partial classes is the perfect solution for that problem.p  pMy question is, why are we wary of the publicly exposed use of nested classes Are there any other arguments against such usep

Negative 38 pDoing some work on controlling printing via the System.Printing framework main classes are PrintQueue, PrintTicket and PrinterCapabilities.  Like with most stuff Ive been working on lately, theres damn little information about it.  Im hoping to compile some good information in this question to help flesh out this subject.p  pPrintTickets give developers a good handle on most common configuration settings for printing.  Thats fortunate, because Id hate to have to do it the old DEVMODE way you can convert DEVMODE binary stream to and from PrintTickets, which is convenient.p  pThe problem is that there are LOTS of printers, each with unique configurations.  These dont fall within the nice properties and enumerations created for PrintTickets.  If you have to configure a printer whose settings lay beyond this interface, you have to serialize your PrintTicket to xml and modify it there.p  pWhen you are working with PrintTicket xml, your life is ruled by three or more schemas  Two by Microsoft and one or more by the printer manufacturer.  The two MS schemas arep  ul liPrintSchemaFramework a hrefhttpschemas.microsoft.comwindows200308printingprintschemaframework relnofollowhttpschemas.microsoft.comwindows200308printingprintschemaframeworkali liPrintSchemaKeywords a hrefhttpschemas.microsoft.comwindows200308printingprintschemakeywords relnofollowhttpschemas.microsoft.comwindows200308printingprintschemakeywordsali ul  pOne of the first issues Ive had dealing with the raw xml is that I cant find any XSDs covering these schemas.p  pstrongDoes anybody know where I can get the XSDs for these schemasstrongp  pThe second big issue Ive encountered was mapping user input to the PrintTicket xml.  Optimally, I would want to take a users input, say Tray 3, and map that through the PrintCapabilities to determine the value of the option to set for that feature.  The documentation for the print capabilities is somewhat unclear, and Im afraid that its full of edge cases that will come back and bite me if I dont do it right.p  pstrongDoes anybody have any good examples for modifying PrintTicket XMLstrongp  pThats a good starting point for this wiki...p  phr p  pUpdate on question 1p  pSent an email off to an address I got from a WinHEC PPT dated back in 2005, and got an actual response from Justin Hutchings, the program manager for Windows Experience  Documents and Printing cool, nop  pWill,p  pThere are no XSDs for the Print Schema namespaces.

Negative 38 pSo I just finished watching this talk on the Python Global Interpreter Lock GIL a hrefhttpblip.tvfile2232410httpblip.tvfile2232410a.p  pThe gist of it is that the GIL is a pretty good design for single core systems Python essentially leaves the thread handlingscheduling up to the operating system. But that this can seriously backfire on multicore systems and you end up with IO intensive threads being heavily blocked by CPU intensive threads, the expense of context switching, the ctrlC problem[] and so on.p  pSo since the GIL limits us to basically executing a Python program on one CPU my thought is why not accept this and simply use taskset on Linux to set the affinity of the program to a certain corecpu on the system especially in a situation with multiple Python apps running on a multicore systemp  pSo ultimately my question is this has anyone tried using taskset on Linux with Python applications especially when running multiple applications on a Linux system so that multiple cores can be used with one or two Python applications bound to a specific core and if so what were the results is it worth doing Does it make things worse for certain workloads I plan to do this and test it out basically see if the program takes more or less time to run but would love to hear from others as to your experiences.p  pAddition David Beazley the guy giving the talk in the linked video pointed out that some CC extensions manually release the GIL lock and if these extensions are optimized for multicore i.e. scientific or numeric data analysisetc. then rather than getting the benefits of multicore for number crunching the extension would be effectively crippled in that it is limited to a single core thus potentially slowing your program down significantly. On the other hand if you arent using extensions such as thisp  pThe reason I am not using the multiprocessing module is that in this case part of the program is heavily network IO bound HTTP requests so having a pool of worker threads is a GREAT way to squeeze performance out of a box since a thread fires off an HTTP request and then since its waiting on IO gives up the GIL and another thread can do its thing, so that part of the program can easily run 100 threads without hurting the CPU much and let me actually use the network bandwidth that is available. As for stackless Pythonetc Im not overly interested in rewriting the program or replacing my Python stack availability would also be a concern. p  p[] Only the main thread can receive signals so if you send a ctrlC the Python interpreter basically tries to get the main thread to run so it can handle the signal, but since it doesnt directly control which thread is run this is left to the operating system it basically tells the OS to keep switching threads until it eventually hits the main thread which if you are unlucky may take a while. p
Negative 38 pI am working on adding some nagios alerts to our system  some of which will monitoring the rate of certain events hitting the nginxapache logs or parsing values from those logs. The way Ive approached the problem so far is with a simple shell script tail fing the log for 25 seconds or so to a temporary file, killing the process, and then running awk, etc over the temp file. The goal here being to get a log sample over 25 seconds and then perform analysis.p  pThis is less than ideal obviously because of the increase in disk IO due to these temp files  what I really would like is an enhanced tail f that would terminate the pipe cleanly after a certain number of seconds. Iep  ptail f interval 5 seconds  grep servep  pWould tail the log for 5 seconds and show me all the lines that have serve.p  pId imagine I can whip up a ruby script to do this pretty quickly, but I wanted to make sure there wasnt a more unixy way to accomplish this.

Negative 38 pI am writing Java program for league sports that goes through current set of played games of each team and their schedules of next games, and then based on that I make a model of flow network. The idea of program is to find which teams are already eliminated and have no chances of wining or sharing 1 place with any other team. After analyzing network applying EdmondsKarp algo. I find out if team gets eliminated or not. Now I also want to simulate this. I am using JGraphT as graph library, and will probably be using JGraph for visualization reason once I create JGraphT objects I can simply instantiate JGraph objects with them and display graph. I also found out for Jung framework yesterday, seems nice. p  pMain problem is I never wrote simulation and its the point where I need Hello World help. When I say simulation I mean I want to visually show every part of algorithm execution, and here is example scenario algorithm has to find augmenting paths, so I want to show when every new edge is added to augmenting path. User will be able to play and stop animation. I also want to show changes in flow in all edges and things like that. So far, I have algorithm working but I dont know how to approach simulation. Should I be using separate thread for simulation execution Should I write separate class that would be executed as algorithm but with states recording without even knowing for real algorithm because I dont want to interrupt performance of real algorithm. Should I use current algorithm and add some lines in between for saving execution states in some data structures that I could use later for displaying simulation to user Any ideas might help..p

Changing the Visibility of the group has no affect on the visibility of the nodes assigned to that group.  No errors appear at anytime as far as i can tell, it just doesnt work.p  pAny ideas  Is my approach possible  If no, any one have alternatives theyd like to suggest .  Im not a huge UI guy, feel much more comfortable in a service layer, so Im open to other suggestions.p

The problem is that it requires the style and script files to be added in the controller, which shouldnt really have to care about those. It also makes it a hassle if the views are done by someone else than me since they would have to fool around with the controller just to add a new stylesheet or a new script file. How can this be done in a better wayp  pJust to clearify, what I am wondering is how to deal with page specific stylesheets and scripts. The default and sitewide ones I have no problem with fetching from a config file or just put directly in the template view. My issue is how to add custom ones for specific pages in a good way.p
Negative 38 pI have a layout problem which I cant fix. Ive looked through many posts on here, and mine seems to be unique enough to post a question.p  pIve created a custom Dialog which programmatically creates a 3 row table. The top and bottom rows have text, while the middle row contains a ScrollView, which contains a LinearLayout. That LinearLayout then contains some number of views TextView in this example. Since Im doing this programmatically, see the XML pseudocode below, and the actual code below that.p  pWhat I would like to happen, is that when the height of the contained content in the LinearLayout gets too big, the ScrollView does its job, and the header and footer TextViews are always visible. p  pstrongThe problem is that when the dialog gets big enough, the ScrollView appears to take over the whole dialog, and my footer TextView disappears off the screen.

If I search for all entities with the county property Amador I also need the Predicate to return entities which may have Amador and Butte as the county property. Second, I need to have the Predicate only return those entities which passed the county condition which also pass a second condition The commodity1 property must also contain gold somewhere in its string.  Thirdly, if the commodity1 property contains the string none, then the predicate must search through commodity2 for the string Gold . If it finds none in that attribute, then it must do the same for the commodity3 property. I could probably structure my database so that I wouldnt have to make such complex queries, but for now I need a solution for this.p

Negative 38 pI have a local filesystem image that I want to transfer to an Amazon EBS volume and boot as an EC2 micro instance. The instance should have the EBS volume as its root filesystem  and I will be booting the instance with the Amazon PVGRUB kernels.p  pI have used ec2bundleimage to create a bundle from the image, and I have used ec2uploadbundle to upload the bundle to Amazon S3. However, now when Id like to use ec2register to register the image for usage, I cant seem to find a way to make the uploaded bundle be the ebs root image. It would seem that it requires an EBS snapshot to make the root device, and I have no idea how I would convert the bundle in to an EBS snapshot.p  pI do realize, that I could probably do this by starting a common instance, attaching an EBS volume to it and then just using scp or something to transfer the image directly to the EBS volume  but is this really the only way Also, I have no desire to use EBS snapshots as such, Id rather have none  can I create a micro instance with just the EBS volume as root, without an EBS snapshotp

Negative 38 pWe are in the final preparations for releasing a product and we have to touch up the user guide.p  pThe current one we have is an amalgamation of some MS Word and some OpenOffice.org documents. While its sufficient, we going to massively redo it after the release in readiness for the following release.p  pWe havent really been happy with either of these solutions Word emorem OpenOffice since they both impose their own limitations. Management have tasked us to identify the use of a markup language and part of that is looking into TeX.p  pBasically, we want plain text documents since we can write shell scripts to change them a lot easier than VBA or OpenOffice macros which will be turned into PDFs. We need support for TOC, index and glossary as well as being able to embed images and have global styles, easily changeable.p  pFor example, say we have a list of commandsp  precode  cmd1 ltparam1gt ltparameter2gt       This command blah blah ...

Ideally, we like to be able to just mark some text with something like codecommandheadercode or codecommandparamscode and have a set of styles automatically applied.p  pQuestion 1 What is the software we need to install to make this task as easy as possible Obviously TeX itself but should we be using something else as wellp  pQuestion 2 How do you do TOC, glossary and index entriesp  pQuestion 3 Can we somehow integrate the build of this PDF into the Visual Studio 2008 build processp  pQuestion 4 How easy is it to generate PDFs from the TeX source file and how do we do itp

Negative 38 pI recently developed an interest in C programming so I got myself a book KampR and started studying.p  pComing from a University course in Java basics, pointers are a totally new chapter, and from what I read online its a rather difficult concept to get your head around. Before getting to the pointer chapter I was under the impression that pointers are a major part of C and provide great benefits. p  pUpon reading the chapter and getting a basic idea of what pointers are and how they work, the benefits are not obvious to me.p  pFor example please correct me if I got this totally wrong in the introduction of pointers in the KampR book it says that since we call by value, when passing a variable in a function call we pretty much pass a copy of the variable for the function to handle and therefore the function cant do anything to the original variable and we can overcome this with pointers.p  pIn a later example that uses a char pointer, the book says that incrementing the char pointer is legal since the function has a private copy of the pointer. Arent private copies a reason to use pointers instead p  pI guess Im a bit confused on the whole use of pointers. If asked I can use pointers instead of using array subscripts for example, but I doubt this is the main use of pointers.p  pLinux and Open source programming was the main reason I got into C. I got the source code of a C project to study Geany IDE and I can see that pointers are used throughout the source code.p  pI also did a bit of searching in the forums and a found a couple of posts with similar questions. An answer was I quote p  blockquote   pstrongIf you dont know when you should use pointers just dont use them.strongp      pIt will become apparent when you need to use them, every situation is different.p blockquote  pIs it safe for me to avoid using pointers at the time being and only use them in specific situations where the need for pointers will be apparent p  pThanks for any input and sorry for the huge post p

Negative 38 pIn Brzozowskis Derivatives of Regular Expressions and elsewhere, the function R returning  if a R is nullable, and  otherwise, includes clauses such as the followingp  precodeR1  R2  R1  R2 R1  R2  R1  R2 codepre  pClearly, if both emR1em and emR2em are nullable then emR1  R2em is nullable, and if either emR1em or emR2em is nullable then emR1  R2em is nullable.

My first thought, mapping  , , or the Boolean operations to regular sets is nonsensical, since in the base case,p  precodea   for all a         codepre  pand  is not a set nor is a set the return type of , which is a regular expression.

Negative 38 pIve been attempting to write an XML parser to read through a Wikipedia XML dump the english language, current revisions only, about 6.2Gb bzipped and have been using the Scala 2.8.1 pull parser.It gets a reasonable way through 3 million of over 10 million articles but seems to be leaking memory gradually and eventually bombs with an out of heap error. I bumped the heap up to 1.5Gb and it got further almost to the end, but then I got I forget the exact exception an error indicating that the garbage collector was giving up spending a large proportion of the overall processing resource without reclaiming much.p  pMy code seems reasonable to me although its not idiomatic functional scala yet and I cant see any obvious source of leaks.

Negative 38 pI was reading a question posted here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions723213sudokualgorithmincSudoku algorithm in Cap  pAnd one of the solutions posted was this piece of code.p  precodepublic static bool IsValidint[] values          int flag  0         foreach int value in values                  if value  0                          int bit  1 ltlt value                         if flag amp bit  0 return false                         flag  bit                                   return true  codepre  pThe idea is that it will detect duplicates in the array of values but Im overwhelmed by how much I dont know.

Negative 38 pId like to enable Wfloatequal in my build options which is a GCC flag that issues a warning when two floating pointer numbers are compared via the  or  operators. However, in several header files of libraries I use, and a good portion of my own code, I often want to branch for nonzero values of a float or double, using codeif xcode or codeif x  0code or variations of that.p  pSince in these cases I am absolutely sure the value is exactly zero  the values checked are the result of an explicit zeroinitialization, codecalloccode, etc.  I cannot see a downside to using this comparison, rather than the considerably more expensive and less readable call to my codenearx, 0code function.p  pIs there some way to get the effect of codeWfloatequalcode for all other kinds of floating point equality comparisons, but allow these to pass unflagged There are enough instances of them in library header files that they can significantly pollute my warning output.p

Negative 38 pthe actual question has been edited because I was successful doing live streaming, BUT NOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNICATION between client and my C code.p  pOkay I finally did live streaming using my C code. BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HTTP IS WORKING HERE. I studied the communication bw my browser and the server at the link a hrefhttpwww.flumotion.comdemositewebm relnofollowhttpwww.flumotion.comdemositewebma using wireshark.p  pI found that the client first sends this GET request p  precodeGET ahiasfhsasfsafsgfg.webm HTTP1.1 Host localhost Connection keepalive Referer filehomeanirudhDesktopanitom.html UserAgent Mozilla5.0 X11 U Linux i686 enUS AppleWebKit534.13 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome9.0.597.98 Safari534.13 AcceptEncoding gzip,deflate,sdch AcceptLanguage enUS,enq0.8 AcceptCharset ISO88591,utf8q0.7,q0.3 Range bytes01024 codepre  pto this get request the server responds by sending this replyp  precodeHTTP1.0 200 OK Date Tue, 01 Mar 2011 061458 GMT Connection close Cachecontrol private Contenttype videowebm Server FlumotionHTTPServer0.7.0.1 codepre  pand then the server sends the data until the client disconnects. The client disconnects when it receives a certain amount of data. The CLIENT then connects to the server on a new port and the same GET request is sent to the server. The server again gives the same reply but this time the client does not disconnect but continuously reads the packets until the server disconnects. I wrote a C code which in which I have a server socket which replicates the above behavior. thanks to wireshark, flumotion and stackoverflowp  pBUT BUT BUT, I could not understand why does the client need to send two requests and why does it resets on the first request and again send the same request on a new port and this time it listens to the data as if its getting live streamed. Also I do not know how I can live stream using chunked encoding.p  pThe same thing in detail is available here  a hrefhttpsystemsdaemon.blogspot.com201103livestreamingvideotutorialfor.html relnofollowhttpsystemsdaemon.blogspot.com201103livestreamingvideotutorialfor.htmlap  pand here a hrefhttpsystemsdaemon.blogspot.com201103httpstreamingvideousingprograminc.html relnofollowhttpsystemsdaemon.blogspot.com201103httpstreamingvideousingprograminc.htmlap  pPlease help me out.

Negative 38 pImagine a simple scenario with a WPF window containing a button and some clear space. Clicking the button creates a new customuser control and places it somewhere randomly on the window.p  pClicking one of these controls will remove it from the window. p  pSo now I have a ViewModel ala MVVM which exposes an ICommand for the create new button, but where does the code to create the new control live Each control will probably have its own ViewModel which will handle its deletion and positioning I guess. p  pCan it be achieved with no code behind on the window AND no real knowledge of the View by the ViewModelp
Negative 38 pI have a design where I want to be able to assign one or more command objects to an entity, which will then use these commands as part of its workflow.  Something like assigning addon features to a users account, for arguments sake.  p  pI understand the Command pattern and how this fits, but my question is one of persistence.  If I have a list of commands, where each user account can have its own list of commands, and lets assume for arguments sake that the only thing important about the command is its system Type, andor they all have the same properties.  Whats the best way to persist that when it comes time to implement my data layerp  pI was considering doing it as a many to many relationship between the accounts table and the commandsfeatures table, where the latter table follows a TPH strategy i.e. all commands persisted in the same table.  That seems to be the most clean way of doing it, but I wanted to see if anyone else follows a different strategyp  pDo you instead make it a 1 many relationship, where any two accounts that have the same feature added have a different instance of that feature  Or is there a better way that Im not thinking of at allp

Negative 38 pI am developing an iPhone application that supports AirPlay using MPMoviePlayerController. When the user click on the play button Player custom View is added to a window. Hence didMoveToWindow is getting called. In this method I create MPMoviePlayerController and load it into custom player view. I set allowsAirPlay of MPMoviePlayerController to YES. Add MPVolumeView to my custom Player view by removing all the volume related controls from MPVolumeView except AirPlay Control.p  pThe problem is that AirPlay control appears after small delay of player loaded.

Negative 38 pLet be honest, I ran into difficulties with my git repository. Ive been working on the same project from two different machines say at work and at home. There is also remote repository codeorigincode where I keep the master copy of the code.p  pAt the beginning I cloned the repository form codeorigin mastercode and started new branch codenewfeaturecode. On daily basis when Im done with changes at work I push my commits from the branch codenewfeaturecode to codeorigincode. The same when I work at home.p  pYesterday I finished working on new feature at home, so I checked our codemastercode and then merged codenewfeaturecode branch. Everything went grand so I pushed my new codemastercode branch to codeorigincode and then deleted codenewfeaturecode branch locally and on remote. Earlier today at work I checked out codemastercode that now contains new feature merged. When I run codegit statuscode now it says that there is nothing to commit, but also my local branch codemastercode is ahead of codeorigin mastercode by 38 commits.p  pHow can I get rid of any of those local commits that are ahead as I know that codeorigin mastercode has the latest codep
Negative 38 pI am encountering a situation whereby an http 1.1 authorization header is sent to every resource under a given domain even though the initial 401 Authentication response by which the authorization information is requested contains a realm associated with a specific resource on the server.p  pI understand from the http 1.1 spec that a browser can preemptively send the Authorization header to a resource for which it already has authenticated.p  blockquote   pA client MAY preemptively send the      corresponding Authorization header with requests for resources in      that space without receipt of another challenge from the server.   a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2617.txt relnofollowhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2617.txtap blockquote  pHowever, it would appear the browser is preempting every resource under the domain with the Authorization header.p  pI have experienced this behaviour for the domain and resources in question whilst using Opera 11.1, IE[7,8], Firefox 3.x which leaves me feeling confident although not 100 this is not a browser bug.p  pIt is worth mentioning that the server presents the resource associated with the realm in question as virtual managed by the Alias directive under Apache 2.0 thus for protected resource x the apache configuration is p  precodeAlias x absolutelinuxfilesystempath  ltDirectory absolutelinuxfilesystempathgt ... AuthName     y AuthType Basic ... ltDirectorygt  codepre  pI have one completely unsupported theory where the issue is related to the fact that x is presented by apache as a virtual resource. I wonder if somehow this ends up mapping the realm to  instead of x. I draw this conclusion from the fact that the browser is preempting the Authorization header to every resource.p  pI would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction as its likley I have misconfigured something in my setup.p  pIn the interests of brevity I have omitted certain information e.g. module versions et al if required please ask and I will be more than happy to provide.p  pThanks for reading.p  pChrisp
Negative 38 pWhen the user presses Edit, my UITableView adds an insert row at the top with a green plus, and puts all the other rows into delete mode red minus. Alternatively, the user can swipetodelete without pressing the edit button. I am using a couple of Ivars to keep track of whether the table is in edit mode from a swipe, or from pressing the edit button, and act accordingly e.g. updating numberOfRowsInTableView with the extra insert row when Edit has been pressed.p  pEverything works perfectly except on thing when in Edit mode i.e. the user has explicitly hit the edit button, and the insert row has appeared at the top, if the user tries to delete the bottom row, the next row up gets deleted instead. Deleting any other row is fine. p  pstrongEDITstrong  It emappearsem to delete the row above, but if I immediately quit and reload the app, it turns out the bottom row has gone after all.

Negative 38 pI am having trouble with an NSManagedObject not reflecting the changes made to a persistent store after a background thread has saved its context.p  pstrongThe Setupstrongp  pIn a simple test application I have a single window that lists all of the objects in my core data persistent store, a search box to filter the results and a text field to show the name of the selected item and allow the name to be changed.p  pBindings are as followsp  pre ArrayController  AppDelegate  ManagedObjectContext TableView Col 1  ArrayController  values  arrangedObjects.widgetName TableView Col 2  ArrayController  values  arrangedObjects.uid  SearchField  ArrayController  predicate  filterPredicate  TextField  ArrayController  value  selection.widgetName pre  pI also have a button that starts a background NSOperation fetch of data from a web server.p  pstrongThe Processstrongp  pWhen the user clicks the refresh button, an NSOperation is kicked off that goes and grabs the widgets asynchronously, parse the response, checks for local widgets to delete that are not in the response, new widgets to add that are not stored locally and existing local widgets that should be updated with the data retrieved form the server.p  pOnce the processing has finished, the main context is notified usingp  precode[mainContext performSelectorOnMainThread        selectormergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification                                withObjectnotification                             waitUntilDoneYES] codepre  pI have an observer in the main controller for testing that shows the changes went through just fine and the main controller got notified.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pIf I make a change to a selected object using the text field, when the data on the background thread is saved, the object in the UI is not updated to reflect those changes i.e. it doesnt overwrite the UI with the changes from the server.p  pFor example, given the following three widgets and IDsp  pre Test Name 1  ID 123 Test Name 2  ID 234 Test Name 3  ID 345 pre  pIf I change the name in the UI of codeTest Name 2code to codeRenamed 2code I have the followingp  pre Test Name 1  ID 123 Renamed 2    ID 234 Test Name 3  ID 345 pre  pWhen I refresh on the background, I want the list to reflect the servers state, ie go back top  pre Test Name 1  ID 123 Test Name 2  ID 234 Test Name 3  ID 345 pre  pInstead it remainsp  pre Test Name 1  ID 123 Renamed 2    ID 234 Test Name 3  ID 345 pre  pI know the persistent store was updated because if I kill the app from XCode and relaunch, the desired information is displayed. If I quit the app normally, the changed value is written to the store on application close and reopening shows the renamed value.p  pstrongWhat Ive Triedstrongp  pI know the message is being sent form the background to the main context and I know the data is being persisted to the store. Therefore, the issue I believe is that the main context is not merging as I would expect it to, or I need to somehow force the array controller to fetch from the persistent store and discard its context.p  ul liI have tried codeprocessPendingChangescode upon notification of the store save, but I suspect I am just writing the codeRenamed 2code to the store.li liI have tried doing a coderearrangeObjectscode on the array controller, but as the array controller is dealing with the main context I suspect this is doing nothingli liI have tried doing a codefetchnilcode on the array controller to do a fetch from the persistent store, but once again I suspect that the main context is overwriting the value of codeRenamed 2code because it is not yet saved.li liI have tried codefetchWithRequestnil mergeNO erroramperrorcode on the array controller as per the Apple docs but still this does not seem to change the displayed valueli ul  pWhat I emthinkem needs to happen is for the array controller to save its data down to the persistent store before I write the background store data so that a fetch on the array controller will cause the data to be accurate as per my expectations. And if this is indeed the case, how would I tell the array controller to do this, or the would the array controller simply know of the changes through bindings if the main managedObjectContext was saved somehowp  pI can hack the solution by doing a fetch from the persistent store, putting that data in an array and doing a codesetContentcode on the array controller and then repeating this when the persistent store is saved, but this feels simply wrong, not to mention the issue of then having to track the selected state of the array controller and potentially any subarray selections that might be happening as a result of that primary selection.p  pAm I off base Im obviously missing something here.p  pAny words of wisdom or advise would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 38 pHi I was wondering how much Java class files change across different compilers. So how much do the actual bytes change if a .java files is compiled by say a Sun JDK 1.4, 1.5 1.6 or even IBM JDK. I know that class files can be different with regards to debug information and obfuscation, but lets assume for the question that those options are the same, so debug information included, no obfuscation. If I ran a MD5 or SHA1 has on a .class file that was compiled by JDK 1.4 would the Hash be different if I compiled it in JDK 1.5 but targeting 1.4 what when targeting JDK 1.5p  pAlso related to that, does a binary of a class file change when different dependencies are used, or asked differently can the binary of a class file change based on its dependencies p  pAnd last but not least are there programmatic ways to analyse the metadata of a .class file in order to identify compiler version and or switches that were used when compiling it p

Negative 38 pCurrently Im working on a RFID project where each tag is attached to an object. An object could be a person, a computer, a pencil, a box or whatever it comes to the mind of my boss. And of course each object have different attributes.p  pSo Im trying to have a table tags where I can keep a register of each tag in the system registration of the tag.

No real schema just a simplified versionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjhkUr.png altenter image description herep  pSuddenly, I realize that this schema could have the same tag in severals tables.  For example, the tag 123 could be in C and B at the same time. Which is impossible because each tag just could be attached to just a single object.p  pTo put it simple I want that each tag could not appear more than once in the database.p  pMy current approach img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7khZB.png altenter image description herep  pWhat I really want img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfVeuj.png altenter image description herep  pstrongUpdatestrong Yeah, the TagID is chosen by the end user.

Each RFID tag is attached to an object in order keep watch them and unfortunately each object have a lot of different attributes.p  pAn object could be a person, a machine or a medicine, or maybe a new object with other attributes.p  pSo, I just want a flexible and cleaver schema. That allow me to introduce new objects types and also let me easily add new attributes to one object. Keeping in mind that this system could be very large.p  pExamplesp  precodeTagTagID Medicinegenericname, comercialname, expirationdate, dose, price, laboratory, ... Machinemodel, name, description, price, buydate, ...

Negative 38 pIm writing an image viewer as a custom Qt widget see a hrefhttpsgithub.comdovQviv relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdovQviva and I now got stuck on the question of how to make my widget notify a parent QScrollArea of changes in the view port, and thus to tell it to move the scrollbars. E.g. if the image viewer changes the zoom factor as the result of a keypress then the scrollbars need to change their page size. p  pOne way of doing it would be to have the widget explicitly check if the parent is a QScrollArea and then make an explicit call to its methods to notify it on any changes. p  pOf course I also need to connect the changes of the ScrollArea to the internal view of the image, but that is a different question. And I need to cut the infinite recursion where the widget reports changes to the scrollbar that report changes to the widget etc.p  pemEdit 2015 Wednesday GMTUTC trying to clarify to Vjo and myself what I need.emp  pWhat I am trying to achieve is the equivalent of a Gtk widget that has been assigned a pair of GtkAdjustments that are connected to a horizontal and vertical scrollbar. In my widget GtkImageViewer, that QvivImageViewer is based on, whenever I change the view due to some internal event e.g. a keypress I update the GtkAdjustments. The scrollbars are connected to such changes and are update accordingly. GtkImageViewer also listens to the GtkAdjustment changes, and thus if the user scrolls the scrollbars, the GtkImageViewer is updated with this information and can change its view. My question is whether there is anything similar to GtkAdjustment in Qt that you can connect to for changes, and update in which case the update will be propagated to all the listenersp  pThus I dont expect the ScrollArea to be part of QvivImageViewer, but if the user has placed QvivImageViewer within a ScrollArea, I want bidirectional communication with it so that the scrollbars reflect the internal state of the widget.p

This is potentially a large file, and I need random access, so Im using pythons mmap module.p  pIf I create the mmap as readwrite for the 2nd process, I have no problem creating ctypes object as a view of the mmap object using frombuffer.  From a cursory look at the ccode, it looks like this is a cast, not a copy, which is what I want.  However, this breaks if I make the mmap ACCESSREAD, throwing an exception that frombuffer requires write privileges.p  pI emthinkem I want to use ctypes fromaddress method instead, which doesnt appear to need write access.  Im probably missing something simple, but Im not sure how to get the address of the location within an mmap.  I know I can use ACCESSCOPY so write operations show up in memory, but arent persisted to disk, but Id rather keep things read only.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 38 pIm looking for a way to generate a set of integers with a specified mean and std. deviation.p  pUsing the random library, it is possible to generate a set of random doubles distributed in gaussian fashion, this would look something like thisp  precodeinclude lttr1randomgt  stdtr1normaldistributionltdoublegt normalmean, stdDev stdtr1ranlux64base01 eng eng.seed1000 for int i  0 i lt N i      gaussiannums[i]  normaleng  codepre  pHowever, for my application, I need integers instead of doubles. So my question is, how would you generate the equivalent of the above but for integers instead of doubles One possible path to take is to convert the doubles into integers in some fashion, but I dont know enough about how the random library works to know whether this can be done in a fashion that really preserves the bell shape and the meanstd. deviation.p  pI should mention that the goal here is not so much randomness, as it is to get a set of integers of a specific size, with the correct mean and std. deviation.p  pIdeally I would also like to specify the minimum and maximum values that can be produced, but I have not found any way to do this even for doubles, so any suggestions on this are  also welcome.p

Negative 38 pA development partners recent, nonnegotiable, platform migration has forced me into .NET 3.5 Compact Framework development for Windows CE 6.0 using Visual Studio 2008.p  pIn other environments, I am accustomed to aggregating a large framework of feature classesmodulesetc. into a static library to be linked with smaller bodies of product configuration code, in order to generate a variety of application andor dynamic library images containing only those components actually referenced.p  pWhile the static linkage is incidental, emthe paring of unused code is of critical importanceem  it satisfies not only footprint concerns, but security requirements in a market where customers view unused codeespecially any that might add capability if executedas an unacceptable vulnerability.p  pUnfortunately, this seems to be at odds with the .NET worldview not to mention solution and project templates provided with VS2008, which appears to favor building DLLs assemblies, class libraries, netmodules, etc. to be reused via deployment in entirety.  Indeed, information to support this approach is in such vast majority that I am rapidly becoming frustrated trying to find anything contrary.p  pSo, emcanem I accomplish a deadcode paring effect equivalent to the artifacts of static linkage, where source code references to components, coupled with a product or solution reference to an aggregated collection thereof, are sufficient to ensure emallem and emonlyem the required components are included in the deploymentp  pFor example, can a tool like ema hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenuspeoplembarnettILMerge.aspx relnofollowILMergeaem accomplish this without significant manual intervention or maintenance overhead e.g. lists of components other than in client code or a frameworklibrary build configuration and with only limited explanation to other developers facing even steeper learning curves or better still, is there some means already present in VS2008p  pbr egrp

Negative 38 pim developing an application in rails, my problem is that now, with the new design of paypals screen, when it redirects the client to my web page to notify him if the transaction has been done correctly, i only get in [params] the controllers and the actions name, when I should recieve this two params [paymentstatus] and [payerstatus].p  pIll try to explain it better, sometimes, when the user finishes the checkout on my web page and clicks on the buy button, my page redirects him to a paypal screen that has the description of the products buyed in the top of the page, and sometimes to another screen that has the description in the right side of the screen.p  pAfter he pays on paypal, he has the option to return to my page, where he would be notified with a message like The transaction has been done. The problem is that always that the user is redirected to the second paypals screen, after he pays and returns to my page, appears a message like The transaction could not be finished correctly, because, like i said before i dont get the correct parameters. But always that the user is redirected from the first screen, i get the correct parameters and i can show the transaction completed message correctly.p  pPlease I really need help. Thank youp

Negative 38 pIm using the jQuery UI Datepicker widget.

Negative 38 pWere about to deploy a Java web application built using JBoss Seam as the application framework.  Well be deploying in a clustered setup, as this is an ecommerce application and were concerned about both highavailability and performance.  Weve done all of our development and initial testing with the app deployed to JBoss 5.1, however weve recently become concerned about things like memory footprint and performance, and have debated moving to Tomcat.p  pOur application is an ecommerce application, using the typical multitiered app, using JSF for the view, EJB3 for the business layer, and JPAHibernate for persistence to a PostgreSQL database.  We also heavily utilize JBoss Cache 2.x for caching support, and Hibernate Search Lucene for search support.  p  pId love to hear the opinion of the community on which app server is best for Seambased applications.  I realize that well have to make some changes to our application architecture no EJBs, timer serviceQuartz scheduler, JBoss CacheehCache, etc. to support the migration.  Were comfortable with making those changes, provided they are comparable to what we would get with JBoss.p  pWith JBoss, it seems as though the clustered setup is much easier.  Would we be able to do a clustered setup with Quartz  ehCache  As I mentioned, were currently deploying to JBoss 5.1.  Would JBoss 7 give us better performance and a smaller memory footprint  If we opt for Tomcat, were leaning towards Tomcat 7.  Is there any compelling reason to opt for Tomcat 6.x insteadp  pId love to hear your opinions and experience with this type of setup.  Weve read the documentation.  Weve done some proofofconcept testing with all of the various platforms.  But, its hard to know what we should run with in production, and dont want to make the wrong choice and then need to rearchitect and test everything again because weve made the wrong choice.

Negative 38 pI am currently refactoring a system.p  pIve got the following situationp  pThe system is about providing information about companies across several business sectors.  Each company can be active in one or more sectors. Companies can be participating in certain partner programmes. An a company can have one or more partner manufacturers e.g. a garage can have a partnership with BMWMercedes etc. All of these participations exist a given period of time validity period. Additionally, a manufacturer like BMW is bound to one business sector. So a company can only be partner of BMW, if BMW is valid for the companies business sector.

Note that there is no codeEnumltgtcode, it is a raw codeEnumcode.  That means that any generic methodscollectionsetc. that would want to operate on the anonymous constantspecific class body types of enums have to forgo generics and use the annotation SuppressWarningsrawtypes if they want to avoid compiler warnings.  Thats why that line wont compile but the one above it will.  codeEnumltTgt.GetDeclaringClasscode properly returns a generic type, but the compilercreated anonymous constantspecific classes for each codeEnumcode value constant do not.p  pSo, whats the rationale  Is this an oversight or is there a reason the language designers didnt change the signature on anonymous constantspecific class bodies of codeEnumcodes codegetClasscode methods to be generic like they did for codeObject.getClasscode when Java generics were added to the languagep

Negative 38 pIm looking to establish some best practices for Android, with regards to code reuse, ease of programmingunderstanding, performance and memory. So, you know, just good code all around. p  pIt seems like a lot of the Android documentation and object design pushes you towards having lots of inner classes. AsyncTask likes to load data right into Views. Adaptors like to have access to the LayoutInflator.p  pFrom a code reuse viewpoint, it would be nice to build a few adaptors or AsyncTasks that solve your problems, and reuse them as needed. This means passing around your context though, which feels dirty and can lead to memory pitfalls if not done carefully. The other option is to bake all the AsyncTasks and Adaptors that an activity needs directly into the Activity. This makes it hard to reuse code, but you can see where things are going easily and since youre using the context directly its harder to hold onto things forever. p  pIm also concerned about writing code that will look familiar to programmers we might hire in the future. p  pWhat are the coding standards for Android What is the best design for an application which needs to load nearly all of its data from the web, have a UI that works on phones and tablets with different activities in each, and be easy to work with and extend for years to comep

Negative 38 pI have a View Controller containing a UITableView that used an NSMutableArray to determine its content via the usual UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource methods.p  pIn the past I have used NSFetchedResults controller to update the TableView as the result of its query results changing. In this case I would like to update the UITableView appropriately as items are added toremoved from the array.p  pHow should I handle this Should I wrap the NSMutableArray in a model class with addItemremoveItem methods which use delegation or Notification to trigger reloadData on the UITableView Or is there a more elegant solutionp  pThere are maximum 20 items in the array so performance isnt so much of an issue.p

This CIL is a Microsoft implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure specification CLI.li liAmong other types, we can make Win32 applications which are called so, as they are made of 32 bit memory addresses. Also, win32 prog. include programming with all kinds of gui elements. li ol  pAm I right Now, my questions p  ol liWhat is the realtionship between mfc and bcl. li liWhat is the relationship between cts and cil.li liDoes the definition of Win32 programming focus more on applications having 32 bit addresses and less on apps including gui elements or is it vice versali ol
Negative 38 pAfter noon i have been asked by a client to create an aspect of an app that is in development. I need to be able to isolate pixel clusters on a back drop for example i need to be able to isolate similare coloured jelly beans within a consistant back drop, now the colour and size of the backdrop is made as an industrie standard thankfully... however i need to be able to, using the android or apple phonetablet take a photo run this script and isolatecount the number of jelly beans in the image, i would like to know what would be the best method for calculating this.p  pMy first thaught was to search by pixel untill i discovered a colour disimilare to the back drop and with a marching ants algorithum isolate the group however this is emidiatley flawed because the assortment of the groups is random and large clusters may be present resulting in a large area being covered by the algorithum and large numbers of subjects being selected within the group.p  pAny help is much appreciated p  pAnd if your wondering why jelly beans i happen to have them on my desk and yes they are all the same colour ....p  pAnother thing the client asked if we could use unity 3d for the application i am proggramming in c however all adaptations and examples are more then welcome p

Negative 38 pHas anybody managed to use jackson 2.0 with Jersey 1.12. It will be very interesting to know. We have to use jackson 1.9.x all over the place, just because jersey has jackson so strongly coupled. From what I see even jersey 2.0M3 is still using jackson 1.9.2. So it seems there is no point to wait for jersey team  to do it in near future.p

Negative 38 pI think this is pretty known control but I couldnt find an WPF exampleblog on the web. What I need is collection of Expander WPF controls stacked on top of each other just like in StackPanel. Difference though is that Expanders should be collapsed by default and once one of them is expanded it should take all the remaining space. If expanded Expander is in the middle of the stack it should push items below it all the way down to the bottom edge of the parent element. Every expandecollapse action should be animated.p  pStackPanel as the parent panel for Expanders here is out of the question because it cant give all remaining space to its children. DockPanel does this partially but it can do that only for the last child and I need to be able to do it for any child.p  pSo what would be the best approach to implement thisp

Negative 38 pI am working on a project in C using sql server as a data base. So the problem is there is a algo in my project which returns a single value every time which is saved to the database as my project requirement. If the algo repeats a value, that will also save to the database which is not required duplication and cause some problems. I need help to overcome the problem that a unique value saves only once when it occurs no repetition in database. I tried to make that column a primary key, but then I found primary key violation exception.p

Negative 38 pSomeone recently directed me to the W3C spec on widgetsp  pa hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRwidgets relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRwidgetsap  pDevelopers can make web apps work offline via a browsers application cache. I had asked how users were supposed to know they could use certain websites offline, which is when the the person brought up the widget spec. It makes sense to split the packaging of an app apart from its offline storage ability. However, after googling around and reading up on widgets, I couldnt find any recent articles on the subject most articles seemed to be from around 2010. Eventually I found Operas SDK, but there was a message at the beginning indicating that they were removing the functionalityp  blockquote   pStarting with Opera 12, Opera Widgets will be turned off for new users   and completely removed in a later release.p      psource a hrefhttpdev.opera.comarticlesviewcreatingyourfirstoperawidget relnofollowhttpdev.opera.comarticlesviewcreatingyourfirstoperawidgetap blockquote  pAre W3C widgets a dead technology And if so, is there any crossbrowser technology being developed for the packaging of web apps Im curious because I think offline storage is interesting, but dont see how users would know that even when they dont have an internet connection, they could browse to a particular URL and have it work, unless the browser told them which apps they had installed or unless every site that supported offline storage explained it to them.p

My initial thought was to just subclass that objects class, and overwrite the moveLeftWithBlock and update its targetY..  but not only do I not like that solution because I still end up with 99 duplicate code amongst the two classes, but also because my game needs the Y position set prior to that moveLeftWithBlock method being called.p  pSo next I thought Ok, so I can make my game call a prepareToMove method, which could do any kind of setup that might be required...  For the main object type, nothing..  For this 2nd object type, set the targetY.p  pHowever, I immediately started thinking wait  I know protocols are about explicitly defining methods that are OPTIONAL or REQUIRED, and it made me think that perhaps I should be utilizing this here, but I just am not sure how.p  pSo, can anyone explain to me how a protocol could be used in this case and if it is the way to go or notp

It is as if it wasnt there at all, no error message whether I submit with an already used Username or not.

I just had to fix the source for the remote call. Cant believe I missed that. Anyway, thank you very much for the help.p

When I step after 2nd line. report shows to be a long value and it just says Long Value . cant even see the contents.p  preport and reportclob are out variable from the procedure. This procedure is called from C code.p  pThere is an exception string buffer too small in C when I call this procedure. I have given 5000 as size of report variable in C sufficient to recieve 4000 max characters value from the procedure.

Negative 38 pA few days ago I stumbled on a code where an extensive use of conversions from strongpointer to typestrong to strongpointer to array of typestrong was made to give a bidimensional view of a linear vector in memory. A simple example of such a technique is reported below for clarityp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  void printmatrixconst unsigned int nrows, const unsigned int ncols, double A[ncols]       Here I can access memory using A[ii][jj]    instead of A[iincols  jj]   forint ii  0 ii lt nrows ii      forint jj  0 jj lt ncols jj       printf4.4g,A[ii][jj]     printfn      int main     const unsigned int nrows  10   const unsigned int ncols  20     Here I allocate a portion of memory to which I could access    using linear indexing, i.e. A[ii]   double  A  NULL   A  mallocsizeofdoublenrowsncols    for int ii  0 ii lt ncolsnrows ii     A[ii]  ii    printmatrixnrows,ncols,A   printfn   printmatrixncols,nrows,A    freeA   return 0  codepre  pGiven that a strongpointer to typestrong is not compatible with a strongpointer to array of typestrong, I would like to ask if there are risks associated with this casting, or if I can assume that this casting will work as intended on any platform.p

This is my first question on stack overflow so please bear with me.p  pI am running this query on SQL Server 2005.p  pI have a large derived dataset ill provide a small subset later which has 4 fields ID, Year, StartDate, EndDatep  pWithin this data set the ID may correctly appear multiple times with different date combinations.p  pThe question I have is what ways are there to identify if a record is new I.E its start date does not fall between the start and end date of any other records for the same id.p  pFor an example take the data set below I hope this table comes out correctlyp  pre   ID  Year  Start Date   End Date      1  2007  01012007  10102007    1  2007  01012007  05042007    1  2007  05042007  08102007    1  2007  15102007  20102007    1  2007  25102007  01012008    2  2007  01012007  01012008    2  2008  01012008  15072008    2  2008  10062008  01012009   pre  pIf we say nothing existed before 2007 then Row 1 and Row 6 are new at that time.p  pRows 2,3,7 and 8 are not new as they either join the end of a previous record or overlap it to form a continuous date period take rows 6 and 7 there are no breaks between 01012008 and 01012009p  pRow 4 and 5 would be considered a new record as it does not attach directly to the end of the previous period for ID 1 or overlap any of the other periods.p  pCurrently to get this data set I have to put all of my data into temporary tables and then join them together on various fields to remove the records I dont want.p  pFirstly I remove rows where the startdate equals the enddate of another row for that ID This would get rid of rows 3 and 7p  pThen I remove rows where the the start date is between the startdate and enddate of other records for that ID this would remove rows 2 and 8p  pThat would leave me withRows 1,4,5 and 6 as the new records which is correct.p  pIs there a more efficient way to do this such as in some sort of loop, CTE or emcoughem Cursorp  pAs per the above, if there is anything unclear dont hesitate to ask and I will try and provide you with the information you request.p

Negative 38 pOur asp.net application is currently experiencing a large number of issues around performance. Have been carrying out various investigations and currently the only thing sticking out is the  time in JIT performance counter for the worker process. p  pOn one site, this tends to spike up to 9095 constantly, but struggling to identify if this has any real meaning or is simply a red herring. The site is published in release mode, with the compilation debug flag set to false, full JIT occurs upon initial load as expected, however, when navigating around the site, we still get these constant spikes in the JIT time counter. Is anyone able to help with knowing how this time is calculated and if it is a reliable indicator of performancep  pOn an even more bizzare note, testing the web app on a local IIS install, I have noticed that again, the initial JIT occurs as expected but the spike in the  time in JIT counter only occurs on the initial load of each individual page  if I then immediately refresh that page, the counter remains at 0. If I wait a couple of minutes and then refresh that page again, the counter spikes. Is there a reason this should be happening It is almost as if the page is JIT compiled then cached for a couple of minutes.p  pThe points that I have been looking at so far in relation to this counter are LINQ queries, regular expressions and calls via reflection, but not having much luck.p  pAny adviceassistance much appreciated, Thanks.p

Negative 38 pRight, so my UITableView loads and puts all the cells in Alphabetical order. Information is then downloaded from a server and calculations are done, with the TableView being reloaded once everything is complete. Currently this is quite a simple procedure as once the information is downloaded from the server, the cells dont even move, they are left in their alphabetical order. Nothing really happens other than half of the information is filled in and small changes are made depending on the calculations. I was wondering if there was an easy way of putting the cells into sections depending on the calculations done after the download is complete I did have an idea of creating 4 arrays there will only be 4 sections ever and once isLoading is set to no, changing the data source of the TableView to have sections, however, that sounds a bit... iffy. I know this is a theoretical question as opposed to a coding problem, but before I go and mess up my code, in what is sure to be a stupidly inefficient way of doing things, is there an easy way of assigning UITableViewCells to sectionsp  pMy main issue with my way of doing it is that should the user delete a cell, deleting the appropriate entry in Core Data will be a little tricky and prone to errors. This lead me on to another idea. What if I added an extra attribute to my Core Data entity. That attribute would be assigned and then saved once the calculations were done. The problem with this is that no existing databases would work. There has to be a neat way of achieving this.p  pThanks for the help. If you need me to post any code just say so and I will.brp

Negative 38 pI have a navigationbarpositioning problem that seems to have appeared with iOS6.br It acts in many ways similar to the proplem some users are experiencing when rotating some viewsp  pThe app has a splash screen, displayed full screen achieved by setting codeHide statusbar during application launchcode to codeTruecodep  pThen in codeviewDidLoadcode in my Master View Controller the following line adds the statusbar back to the appp  precode[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHiddenNO withAnimationUIStatusBarAnimationNone] codepre  pThis adds the StatusBar to the app, and shifts the view downwards 20pt as expected. However, the NavigationBar stays put, underneath the StatusBar with a 20pt glitch underneath.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVsmiC.png altThe glitch created by adding statusBarp  pBefore iOS6 I used to fix this by adding the following line of codep  precode[UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.frameCGRectMake0, 20, 320, [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.height20 codepre  pNow, however, this do not work.p  pSome research shows that at the time of calling codeviewDidLoadcode, codekeyWindow.framecode has a size and origin both of 0,0, and altering it has no effect.p  pWhen inserting the two lines mentioned above to codeviewDidAppearcode I get the same behaviour when the app launches. When I dhen move to another view and back to the first view however, the alteration of codekeyWindow.framecode has the desired effect and the NavigationBar ends up positioned where it should be.p  pMy question then How to make the NavigationBar gets its right position after adding the StatusBar to an iOSapp when the StatusBar is initially hiddenp

Negative 38 pI would like to create a website using Visual Studio 2012 For Web which has a database and a generated UI such as we have if we use the template projectp  pDynamic Data Entities Web Applicationp  pBut I would also like to have a login page such as provided by the template projectp  pAsp.Net Web Forms Applicationp  pI have found that the templates are great for either of these tasks but are pretty bad if you want both of them. p  pIf I start with the Dynamic Data Entities Web Application template then I get great pages for the data base side with very little coding to do  but I cannot manage to get the login code working also, I dont think I should be writing that code anyway, since it already exists in the Asp.Net Web Forms Application. Whenever I try I get into a hideous mess. I dont really want to learn about authentication and membership and cookies or how it does it or any of that stuff. What I want is for the .Net framework to handle all of that and just tell me what the username is of the person looking at the page. Thats all. And there is a way to do it, with the Asp.Net Web Forms Application template.p  pBut if I start with the Asp.Net Web Forms Application template then the login stuff works outofthebox ... but then I get into a hideous mess trying to create a UI for the database But that should not be necessary given that that code already exists in the Dynamic Data Entities Web Application template. Again, I dont really want to learn how it does it, I just want to use it to do the stuff for me so that I dont have to. I dont want to have to tell it how to update, delete etc... and I dont have to with the Dynamic Data Entities Web Application template, but then I cant get the login stuff.p  pAnyhow, I have torn out most of my hair with what I thought would be a pretty simple task Create a website with loginregistration with a simple database using the Code First Entities approach. My experience has been that if you want to have a database but no login then you are laughing. If you want to have a login but no database UI then you are laughing. If you want to have both then there is a lot of pain ahead unless you are a super duper Microsoft technology expert who lives and breathes this stuff.. or you know the trick which probably exists in some forum somewhere.p  pAnyway, my question is, what am I missing here Is there a website with a whole bunch of other templates which does have the template that combines the Web Forms with automated loginmembership control with the Dynamic Data Entities Web Application which does a great job of displaying the tables and allowing editing I find it difficult to believe that Microsoft intended that I have to know how to do all of the stuff that Dynamic Data Entities Web Application does and that Asp.Net Web Forms Application in order to get both functionalities.p  pIt took me a week to figure out how to get EnableMigrations to work in the Web Forms template type... Basically every small step has been a huge battle, requiring reading of forum after forum to discover little tricks. But in the end, all I really want is a template that combines the Dynamic Data Entities Web Application  capability i.e. data driven webpages with the Web Forms capability i.e. user login and to publish it on Azure. I thought that would be simple. But it turns out that it has been a nightmare and in fact I am completely stuck.p  pUpdatep  pI have just spent another halfday trying to get this to work following the advice on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee923692vvs.100.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee923692vvs.100.aspxa . But it does not work for me. It should not be so complicated. It should not require that level of tinkering to make such a common web site format a database with UI and a login. p  pNow I am back to the first problem I encountered a few days ago, which went away somehow, but I have no idea howp  pPM EnableMigrations System.ArgumentException The parameter is incorrect.

For me to create a grid view for every one of my tables, and hook up the RowChange, UpdateMethod, DeleteMethod etc... by hand i.e. not using the dynamic data scaffolding would be ridiculous given that the scaffolding exists it is just too difficult to get it to work unless I use that template from the outset, but if I use that template then I dont have a login page. Anyhow, now this  The parameter is incorrect error is popping up again so I am going around in circles.p

Negative 38 pI just ran into a nasty little bug with something I was doing because I opened a file for input and not output thats not the nasty part. It happened because I was using XMLWriter, which can take either a blessed IOHandle reference or a filehandle for output or a scalar ref, but thats not important here. Internally, XMLWriter calls codegtprintcode on whatever output ref its using.p  pThe problem arose because its possible to call codeprintcode on a filehandle thats been opened only for input, and IOHandle doesnt warn at all. Heres some code to illustratep  precodeopen my out, lt, out.txt say out testing          warns, Filehandle opened only for input outgtprinttesting      doesnt do anything  open my out2, gt, out2.txt out2gtprinttesting     works fine codepre  pWhats going on here Is this expected behavior I dont use the IO classes a whole lot, so am I just misunderstanding somethingp  pEdit for clarityp  pThe code above definitely produces one warning line 2. I feel like line 3 should also produce a warning, but it doesnt. It doesnt print anything to codeoutcode, nor does it warn that it doesnt...it simply fails silently which seems wrong. Line 3 doesnt produce a warning on any version of Perl I have 5.8, 5.10, or 5.16.p

Negative 38 pI have a JPanel inside JScrollPane. Inside the JPanel are numerous JButtons. However, these JButtons are set to NOT VISIBLE jbutton.setVisiblefalse when the JPanel and JScrollPanel are initialized. The JButtons are only set to VISIBLE jbutton.setVisibletrue when another class triggers this.p  pHowever, although these JButtons are getting successfully added and set to visible on the JPanel, they are not visible on the JPanel or JScrollPane. My guess is that when the JScrollPane adds the JButtons, the JButtons are set to NOT VISIBLE, and even if the JButtons are set to VISIBLE, the JScrollPane does not detect they are.p  pIs there a way of dynamically changing the visibility of the JButtons in the JPanel inside the JScrollPane p

This is an issue because the controller above changes the scope variable loading to true and if the user goes back he will still see the button showing the value loading.p  pIf the controller would be entered at history back the loading variable would be set to false and the button would show the initial, and correct value.p  pBy accident I discovered that when I include only include, no method call to it.. the a hrefhttpwww.asual.comjqueryaddress relnofollowjquery address plugina a hrefhttppastebin.comLHuhHKjS relnofollowpaste bin codea the controller is entered on history back, the loading variable is set to false and the submit buttons shows the correct value, not the loading.. value.

Negative 38 pI have a Java application that uses a native library for some of its functionality. It uses JNI to control the native library and also receives asynchronous callback from the library. You can think of it as a Java frontend and native backend that communicate with each other.p  pI am facing a memory leak. Shortly after I start the application, the memory slowly but steadily increases. So I tried to look what could cause the leak. p  pFirst, I tried replacing the Java frontend with a simple C text interface. That way, the application doesnt use Java in any way  and the leaks stopped. So the problem must be in Java frontend. p  pSo I fired up the jvisualVM to see if the heap increases  and it turned out it doesnt. The Java heap size was fairly constant. I even launched the program with xmx32m, but the memory kept increasing well past 100m without any codeOutOfMemoryErrorcodes. In fact, the jvisualVM showed Java heap at about 7m. p  pSo I dug deeper into the program with WinDbg. I analyzed the heap patterns with codeheap scode command and I got thisp  pHeaps on a freshly run programp  precode0059gt heap s LFH Key                    0x382288b9 Termination on corruption  ENABLED   Heap     Flags   Reserv  Commit  Virt   Free  List   UCR  Virt  Lock  Fast                      k     k    k     k length      blocks cont. heap   00330000 00000002    2048   1704   2048     22    71     2    0      0   LFH 005b0000 00001002    1088    212   1088     68     3     2    0      0   LFH 00aa0000 00001002    1088    108   1088     15     7     2    0      0   LFH 004f0000 00001002   15424  12876  15424   1372    89     9    0      1   LFH ...  0059gt heap stat h 004f0000  heap  004f0000 groupby TOTSIZE maxdisplay 20     size     blocks     total       percent of total busy bytes     2b110 20  562200  60.36     98 166e  d5150  9.33     6cd20 1  6cd20  4.77     ... codepre  pHeaps on a program that has been running for about half an hourp  precode0046gt heap s LFH Key                    0x5e47ba72 Termination on corruption  ENABLED   Heap     Flags   Reserv  Commit  Virt   Free  List   UCR  Virt  Lock  Fast                      k     k    k     k length      blocks cont. heap   006b0000 00000002    2048   1744   2048     46    92     2    0      0   LFH 00200000 00001002    1088    220   1088     68     3     2    0      0   LFH 00950000 00001002    1088    108   1088     15     7     2    0      0   LFH 001b0000 00001002   47808  31936  47808   1855   102    12    0      0   LFH ...  0046gt heap stat h 001b0000  heap  001b0000 groupby TOTSIZE maxdisplay 20     size     blocks     total       percent of total busy bytes     98 59d1  355418  36.67     2b110 10  2b1100  29.61     6cd20 1  6cd20  4.68     ... codepre  pNow it can be clearly seen that the leaks are caused by a growing number of blocks with size 98.

Negative 38 pSo I have built a site on my workplace network using django and deploying it with wamp. I dont have a direct connection from my workplace to the internet so I cant show any actual code not without taking some time to print and rewrite everything.p  pNow ever since I deployed the site I have been facing one of the worst and weirdes bugs I have ever encountered. It happens only on IE and not even all the time. p  pwhat happens is I created a modelform I added a few lines to make it nicer, but nothing complicated that I couldnt handle on the validation part, and just put it in a template as is. I have added a csrf token and everything seems to be in order.p  pThat is until you click on sending the data. Thats when he sends  for some reason, a completely empty request. I dont mean he sends an empty form  he sends a request without any data at strongallstrong. First I thought it had something to do with the jquery UI I have just for adding dates, or the csrf going weird but ommiting them didnt change anything as in, when you omit the csrf token and middlewere it acts as if you sent an empty form, but when its enabled it acts as if the csrf caught an exeption  because an empty request means no value for the csrf hidden field.p  pI actually used wireshark and caught the error and ... thats it. Im no closer to solving it. I tried everything, from changing the page to quirks mode, to rewriting all the html to writing several different template versions just to see what happens. p  pAnd Its driving me insane becuase this doesnt even happen all the time. I know I mentioned that already but I just cant make any sense of it. And before you ask  no, its not an option to use a different webbrowser because all the webapps my company uses are fit to work with IE and most people here are not technological enough to use multiple browsers.p  pone more important thing that might help  the bug almost always happens the first time you visit the page or when you open it in a new tab. If, say, you already went back and forth a few times in the same tab, it usually works fine. were using IE8, on windows xp computers. Any help would be extremely appreciated, thanks p

Negative 38 pIm trying to optimize my pages via CSS for printing from the browser. The problem Im having is setting up the page breaks properly. I have it preventing pagebreaks in the middle of images and blocks of text that shouldnt be separated exactly how I want. However, the problem Im having is that sometimes theres a horizontal rule separating a new section and then emjustem the title of the next section and potentially a description of that section, with the rest of the actual section displayed on the next page. This is confusing and poor formatting, as normally if the title of the section is that close to the bottom of the page, youd just throw in a page break before it to bump the whole thing to the next page and not worry about the tiny amount of space on the previous page youre sacrificing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSH8Iw.jpg altPage break dilemmap  pThe HTML here is very simplistic.

Negative 38 pFor a schoolproject I need to make use of the a hrefhttpaubio.org relnofollowaubioa library. However, I have a problem compiling it for Windows.p  pI downloaded the latest source from his git 0.4.0 alpha. Then I compiled it using Cygwin, using the withtargetplatformwin32 to crosscompile it for Windows. It uses waf by the way. This works without any errors.p  pNext step is copying the compiled file libaubio.dll.a to MinGW library folder. Then I want to compile the Python wrapper for the module, but it shows up the ld.exe cannot find laubio error.

Even with it included the Haraka output is exactly the same and this.loginfo call in the first line of the function doesnt appear. The error and output produced by Swaks is also exactly the same. Still after reading Matts after I have included it. To double check this I also tried commenting out all the code in exports.checkplainpasswd and just returned cbtrue in all cases. Nothing changed.

Now Im trying to figure out how to change the selected tabs background.p  pThe relevant property isp  precodeUIManager.putTabbedPane.selected,Color.MAGENTA codepre  pHowever, I dont seem to have a way to use that in the tabUI its baffling, but theres no background Color variable in BasicTabbedPaneUI.p  pEdit Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will come by with a good answer, but if you googled this my current solution is to use a neutral color for the selected tabs background color since there seems to be no simple way to update it. I also switched to a neutral tab border even though you CAN update that as the example shows and created the colored borders inside the contained JPanels. Its not ideal, but it looks pretty good and I dont have time to continue looking for a cleaner solution at the moment. p

I decided to build a game that I remember playing when I was a kid called dopewars.p  pThis is my second attempt at this game. When I began my first attempt, all went well. After a short while my source code began to fill wildly out of control until I could continue no more as I kept getting lost within mountains of code.p  pI then decided to begin again, only this time I wanted to seperate the gui from the logic 2 different .java files. This is where my problem lies. Previously this would work fine. Since seperating my java files the functionality has stopped.p  pWhen I press jbutton b1, my program is supposed to take the price value of cocaine and the units value entered into the jtextfield by the user, perform a calculation by accessing a method within Buy.java, and then update the appropriate JLabels within the s jpanel of GUI.java.p  pFor example, user x wants to buy cocaine at the price indicated, so he enters a value representing the quantity he would like.

Negative 38 pIm building a ratelimiting decorator in codeflaskcode using coderediscode stores that will recognize different limits on different endpoints. I realize there are a number of ratelimiting decorators out there, but my use case is different enough that it made sense to roll my own.p  pBasically the issue Im having is ensuring that the keys I store in redis are classspecific.

Negative 38 pSo Im using SSIS SQL Server 2012 to uploadload some data from a dbf into a table. Basically, Im using a ForLoop Container to read the dbfs note hundreds of dbfs and put the data in the table. For the most part so far so good. However, there are a few dbfs like 5 or 10 and automatically created by another process I have no control over that have a slightly different schema ie. missing a column X and has a new column Y. So Im wondering if there is a way to make those columns optional or just automatically make them return NULL. Or some way to have SSIS check the two schemas and have do the right thing.p  pCurrently, when SSIS runs into these dbfs, it gives me codeThe external columns for OLE DB Destination are out of synchronization with the data source columns.code error.p

Negative 38 pAlright, Im in the middle of making a decal system that paints directly on textures. I also have it doing the legwork on the video card so theres no lag like using a Texture2D.Apply approach.p  pAnyway, essentially Im just stamping the texture with the decal at the specified UV coord. My next step is to isolate the island hit by the raycast so I can limit the decal to that island. So that way when a decal hits near the edge of an island, it doesnt leak into neighboring islands.p  pWhat I knowp  pUV coord of raycast hit where I drawp  ptriangle index that was hit how I find the correct texture to draw onp  pan array of all the UVs not using it yet, but Im fairly sure it would help in the isolation processp  pCan anyone help me figure out how to isolate the island that was hit Ive really scowered this forum, unity forum, and google...found some similar pleas for help but no answers.p  pAny help is much appreciated  ]p  pEdit After speaking with some of the artists, a UV Island is also sometimes refered to as a shell.p

Negative 38 pIm writing a program to downloadupload a file between a client and server using socket programming. The code ive written till now works in the sense that i can sucesfully transfer files. However , if a connection fails due to problem in the networkclientserver while a download  upload is occuring.. i need to RESUME the downloadupload from the original pointDo not want the originally sent data to be resent. Im not sure how to go about this. Im reading the file into a byte array and sending it across the network. My initial idea is that everytime im downloading.. i should check if the file already exists and read the data into a byte array  send the data to the server for comparison and then return the remaining data from the server file by comparing the two byte arrays. But this seems inefficient and takes away the point of resuming a downloadsince im sending the data again. Note The file name is an unique identifier. I would really appreciate it if anybody could give me suggestions as to how i should implement the file resume functionalityp  precodeServer side code     package servers     import java.io.

Negative 38 pIm hoping to write a simple FTPlike app, including both the client and the server in a Microsoft environment. I say FTPlike because I wont need to follow FTP protocol, I just want to build a client that can send a directory  file string to a server, and then have that server either send back the contents of the file, or send the file itself. p  pRight now my pseudocode is something like thisp  pFTP Client  open socket   send file string to server  other functionality as desired  receive responsep  pFTP Server  open socket  new thread for every incoming connection  receives file string  checks to see if file string is in the right format and if the file exists  sends response to client to tell if string was valid  either open up and read text files, or transfer the file itself  send file or contents of file back to clientp  pDoes that general skeleton make sense Is there anything obvious that I might be missing I was thinking that I might need one socket each for the status and transfer. Any tips or general direction on how to proceed further with this project would be appreciated.p
Negative 38 h2Questionh2  pI have a method to wrap functions by replacing them with a macro so that I can log the call and the return code.  Heres an example which worksp  precodeint rc int fooint a, int b int barint a, char b, int c  void    LogRetchar fn, char file, char from, int ln, int ret      printfs.s.d s  ret08xn, file, from, ln, fn, ret      define fooargs, ...  rc  fooargs, VAARGS, LogRetfoo, FILE, FUNCTION, LINE, rc, rc  define barargs, ...  rc  barargs, VAARGS, LogRetbar, FILE, FUNCTION, LINE, rc, rc codepre  pThe macro for the function it substitutes calls the function and logs the function name and where it was called from as well as the return code.  Wrapping any function uses the same syntax and just needs the function name replaced in the macro 3 times.  What I would like to do is create wrapper macro where the macro redefine for foo would be something similar top  precodedefine fooargs, ... WRAPPPERfoo codepre  pI understand the basics of stringify and double stringify but I cant even get the WRAPPER macro to do the real function call.  Ideally, Id like to get it down to single WRAPfoo statement.  The reason is, I have around 100 or more functions Id like to wrap and it would like to do it simple from one simple force include file. Im coming to the conclusion that its not possible but I thought Id ask here before abandoning the idea.  Im using clang and vc if that makes any difference but it would be nice to have this on any compiler as I debug a lot of different systems.p  hr  h2Adaptation of Jonathan Lefflers answerh2  pAs Im new here I wasnt sure if this should be a separate answer or and edit update.  This is essentially Jonathan Lefflers answer. Its in a functional example. While the 2 functions it calls are pointless, the goal was to have a macro that could wrap any function with any arg list. My main use is in logging the use flow in a large code library that has a problem.  Also, my original sample has one glaring weakness.  By storing the return code in a global it is not thread safe without cumbersome preparation in TLS. The global is now removed and the macro no longer uses the sequence operator to return the value, it is preserved and returned by the logging function. Also, as Augurar pointed out and shown in Jonathans example. If the macro is declared in the same file as the function declaration, it requires parentheses.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int fooint a, int b int barint a, char b, int c   if defined DEBUG   defined DEBUG  Short version of FILE without path requires runtime parsing define SFILE strrchrFILE,   strrchrFILE,   1  FILE ifdef WIN32   define WRAPPERfunc, ...

Negative 38 pI am trying to use a gamepad to control an application. Its not a game, just a plain application using Windows Forms. So it doesnt have a game loopupdate process or anything like that. I wouldnt like to use XNA because I think its a huge overload just to capture a button press.p  pI am experimenting with both SlimDX and SharpDX. As I understand, they are just wrappers for DirectX, rightp  pLooking at the documentation, it seems like there is no event for a button press. So I have been looking for an alternative. I have tried adding a timer from the emSystem.Windows.Forms.Timerem class, and reading the state of the gamepad like thisp  precodeprivate void timertickobject sender, EventArgs e      State s  controller.GetState     stateLabel.Text  s.Gamepad.Buttons  GamepadButtonFlags.A  A    codepre  pWith a small enough interval between timer ticks Im using 10ms, I can see whether the button is pressed or not. However, I dont want to handle the button press multiple times should the button be held down  I need to make sure it has been released before handling the button press again. Between two ticks of the timer, I dont know if a button was pressed twice or if it was just being held down.p  pI thought about using the packet number in the controller state, but it will change at the slightest touch on an analog stick or shoulder trigger.p  pHelpp

Negative 38 pIm trying to build a scalable, caching, resizing image server, the only thing that it does is gets url like example.comdfdcdb77cadea600x450 and it resizes the image with hash dfdcdb77cadea to 600px to 450px and it displays it. If there was a resized image already in cache it displays the cached version. p  pMy main production code is in django and apache. To build this caching server should I go to something lighter like flask and ngninx instead of django and apachefor better performance Is there any other combination that Im not consideringp

Negative 38 pI am trying to download the lesson player heremy.thinkwell.comcfexternal39B0F4357B39968D. I have downloaded the SWF filea hrefhttpthinkwell.cachefly.netplayerTWPlayer.swf relnofollowhttpthinkwell.cachefly.netplayerTWPlayer.swfa. What I want is to make this file work on browser offline. I have downloaded the [page][1] source and edited the code in order for the SWF file to run, but nothing works. Ive discovered that this SWF file communicates with a coldfusion file called config.cfmthinkwell.cachefly.netplayerconfig.cfm to get the [XML file of the lesson  which contains the lesson presentation files. I dont know how the process is exactly going and if there are other files included in the process. What I want to reach is to download all the files related to the whole process in order to be able to run it offline. Thanks in advancep

Negative 38 pI am struggling with this for three days now. It is an android client application that connects to the server AIR application through Wifi on local network. I need my application to connect to the server every time it is launched without asking the user to enter local IP, in case it changed. It seems there are many ways to make sure the connection is successful, but I want to make sure I can go without the help of RTMFP or PHP or SharedObject stuff.  I am able to get local IP using NetworkInterface and NetworkInfo ANE from Android client. Then I use the variable to  mySocket.connectipAddress, 8888p  pBut there is a problem 1 When debugging on Android via Wifi The detected IP 192.168.137.2 2 When debugging on Flash, on computer The detected IP 192.168.137.3 So, the local IPs are not the same. So client fails to connect. Everything works perfect, if I manually set that IP, but I need a code that works, even if the IP on local network changed.p  pAs I mentioned making a textInput field in case IP changed and ask the user manually enter IP is not an option.p  pMy question is why using localhost as host parameter of socket.connecthost, port does not work If it did, there would be no need for detecting local IP at all. localhost works for me only if the client is running on computer, but not Android. Is it the problem with Security Policy file if so, I have no idea how to use that. I cant find any tutorial on that.p

Negative 38 pI read an example from an older StackOverflow post about when to use stackalloc. Now this example has me a bit puzzledp  precodepublic unsafe void DoSomeStuff      byte unmanaged  stackalloc byte[100]     byte[] managed  new byte[100]      Do stuff with the arrays      When this method exits, the unmanaged array gets immediately destroyed.     The managed array no longer has any handles to it, so it will get      cleaned up the next time the garbage collector runs.     In the meantime, it is still consuming memory and adding to the list of crap     the garbage collector needs to keep track of. If youre doing XNA dev on the     Xbox 360, this can be especially bad.  codepre  pNow feel free to correct me if Im wrong, as Im still quite a novice in C and programming in general. But arent bytes value types And arent value types stored where they are declared Doesnt this mean that in this example, codemanagedcode is also stored on the stack, and by extension when this stack frame finishes and it goes to the calling adress the memory is cleaned up automatically and therefore codemanagedcode should be removed in the same manner as codeunmanagedcode in this examplep

Please help me.p  pThanks,p  pKeelenp  pEDIT What I meant was I am putting out what my teacher gave me.  Sorry I mislabeled it skeleton code.  My problem is inserting the .dat file using an insertion sort.  The way its phrased leads me to believe it wants me to sort it and overwrite the data file.  So the code would just work in teh data file, then overwrite it with the sorted version.  This is way beyond anything Ive done before, my biggest code project before this was making a rock paper scissors game.  And no, it did not take me an hour and a half for the blank code, I was saying the way I did it didnt work, so I was giving a blank slate. Sorry.p

Negative 38 pI am trying to draw the icon of the feature defined as OpenLayers.Feature.Vector after clicking on it different than the original one, at the same point. The process of clicking works really good, however I want to change the graphic of clicked feature and I have problems with that.p  pWhat am I doingp  pAt first I declare both layers one for the original, selectable feature and then for the one that should be drawn after the first one is selected and add it to the mapp  precodevar firstLayer  new OpenLayers.Layer.VectorLayer1 map.addLayerfirstLayer var selectedLayer  new OpenLayers.Layer.VectorSelected map.addLayerselectedLayer codepre  pThe layers are clickable, proper handlers are attatched to them. What is more, I create styles for features that could be drawn on both layersp  precode  Styling feature of type1 for Layer1  type1Marker  openLayers.Util.applyDefaultstype1Marker, openLayers.Feature.Vector.style[default]  type1Marker.externalGraphic  somefile.svg  type1Marker.pointRadius  iconsRadius  type1Marker.fillOpacity  1    Styling feature of type1 for Selected layer  type1MarkerSelected openLayers.Util.applyDefaultstype1MarkerSelected, openLayers.Feature.Vector.style[default]  eventObdConnectionLostIconSelectedStyle.externalGraphic somefileselected.svg  type1MarkerSelected.pointRadius  iconsRadius  type1MarkerSelected.fillOpacity  1    Styling feature of type2 for Layer1  type2Marker  openLayers.Util.applyDefaultstype2Marker, openLayers.Feature.Vector.style[default]  type2Marker.externalGraphic  somefile2.svg  type2Marker.pointRadius  iconsRadius  type2Marker.fillOpacity  1    Styling feature of type2 for Selected layer  type2MarkerSelected openLayers.Util.applyDefaultstype2MarkerSelected, openLayers.Feature.Vector.style[default]  type2MarkerSelected.externalGraphic  somefile2selected.svg  type2MarkerSelected.pointRadius  iconsRadius  type2MarkerSelected.fillOpacity  1 codepre  pThen some features for Layer1 are created at different points. I store those features in an array of features expanded by some additional data that I use later to distinguish the type of the marker that I want to use and I store the position of the marker on the map.  And now there goes some logic that is executted after clicking on any feature p  precodevar size  new OpenLayers.Size30, 30 var offset  new OpenLayers.Pixelsize.w  2, size.h var icon  new OpenLayers.Iconhttpwww.openlayers.orgdevimgmarker.png, size, offset var marker  new OpenLayers.Feature.VectorclosestPoint, icon var markerSel  new OpenLayers.Feature.VectorclosestPoint.event.point, icon switch closestPoint.type      case type1         markerSel.style  type1MarkerSelected         break     case type2         markerSel.style  type2MarkerSelected         break   var selectedLayer  map.getLayersByNameSelected[0] if selectedLayer.features.length  0    selectedLayer.removeAllFeatures selectedLayer.addFeaturesmarkerSel selectedLayer.redraw force true  codepre  pWhat is going on is really weird for me, i.e. after clicking on the marker from Layer1 nothing happens, then if I scroll out the map it disappears and finally when I scroll more, the marker is displayed with the style I wanted that is selected one. Especially the disappearing of the feature from Layer1 is something that I do not get at all  why it disappears while no operations on that layer are performed I would like to stack the new icon above the one from Layer1 zOrdering of the map is set to true and the Layer1 is defined before the Selected layer.p  pDoes anybody know what could cause the problem I have spent several hours on trying to fix it but now Im out of ideas. Thank you in advancep

Negative 38 pI have a primary slider showing mostly images  one at a time on the bottom of which is another slider of thumbnails.

The jQuery I used to do that is as follows jump to the last function p  precodedocument.readyfunction         mainslider  .bxslider.bxSlider             speed 500,             adaptiveHeight true,             video true,             auto true,             autoHover true,             autoControls true,             autoControlsCombine true                  thumbslider  .thumbnailslider.bxSlider             slideWidth 40,             minSlides 2,             maxSlides 15,             slideMargin 2                   thissliderindex  .bxslider projectgalleryview galleryprojectdisplay a.maindisplay.attrhref          .thumbnailslider a.bxclone.click function             .thumbnailslider a.bxclone.attrhref, thissliderindex           codepre  pWhat Im doing here is making an onclick function for each thumbnail of the thumbnail class. I then set the href attribute of each to the index of each image in the primary slider. However, my sliders act as if this function doesnt exist, which means that Im clearly missing something. Ive tried searching for solutions for hours, but cannot figure out what I did wrong here.  Disclaimer Im not very familiar with jQuery either, so please forgive me if its something obvious.p

Negative 38 pI am trying to learn JavaScript, PHP and some basic clientside form validations in trying to build this basic JavaScript tutorial that interacts with PHP and HTML. WHat I am trying to do is interrupt a form submission event, i.e. user forgets to enter a valid email format in the email submission input and clicks on the submit button which should then display an error message and not allow the form to be submitted. But I cant get this to work for me. What happens is that I am instead taken to the supportprocess.php page when that should not happen.

Negative 38 pI have 4dimensional data which needs to be clustered to build minimum volume bounding ellipsoids for each cluster. I dont want to have single point clusters or at least,  as less number of single point clusters as possible, because we cant build an ellipsoidal confidence region with a single point.

So I am using Scikitlearns Affinity Propagation  a hrefhttpscikitlearn.orgstablemodulesclustering.htmlaffinitypropagation relnofollowhttpscikitlearn.orgstablemodulesclustering.htmlaffinitypropagationa to estimate the number of clusters and perform clustering from the data.

Negative 38 pI got this library of mathematical routines  without documentation  to work on some task at college. The problem I have with it is that all of its functions have void return type, although these functions call one another, or are part of another, and the results of their computations are needed. p  pThis is a piece of  simplified  code extracted from the libraries. Dont bother about the mathematics in code, it is not significant. Just passing arguments and returning results is what puzzles me  as described after code  p  precode first function  void vectormath  get the output vector we need       double inputV[3],  input vector    double outputV[3]  output vector            some variable declarations and simple arithmetics        .....               transposeMmatrix1, matrix2, 3, 3   matrix2 is the result        matrixXvector matrix2, inputV, outputV  here you get the result, outputV       second function   void transposeM  transposes a matrix              stdvectorlt stdvectorltdoublegt gt mat1,  input matrix       stdvectorlt stdvectorltdoublegt gt ampmat2,  transposed matrix       int mat1rows, int mat1columns                       int row,col      mat2.resizemat1columns   rows      for stdvectorlt stdvectorltdoublegt gtiterator itmat2.begin it mat2.endit           itgtresizemat1rows   for row  0 row lt mat1rows row            for col  0 col lt mat1columns col          mat2[col][row]  mat1[row][col]                     third function     void matrixXvector  multiply matrix and vector                stdvectorlt stdvectorltdoublegt gt inMatrix,           double inVect[3],           double outVect[3]                  int row,col,ktr       for row  0 row lt 2 row             outVect[row] 0.0      for ktr  0 ktr lt 2 ktr          outVect[row] outVect[row]  inMatrix[row][ktr]  inVect[ktr]             codepre  pSo vectormath is being called by the main program. It takes inputV as input and the result should be outputV. However, outputV is one of the input arguments, and the function returns void. And similar process occurs later when calling transposeM and matrixXvector. p  pstrongWhy is the output variable one of the input arguments  How are the results being returned and used for further computation  How this kind of passing and returning arguments works strongp  pSince I am a beginner and also have never seen this style of coding, I dont understand how passing parameters and especially giving output works in these functions. Therefore I dont know how to use them and what to expect of them  what they will actually do . So I would very much appreciate an explanation that will make these processes clear to me.p  pstrongEXTRA strong p Thank you all for great answers. It was first time I could barely decide which answer to accept, and even as I did it felt unfair to others. I would like to add an extra question though, if anyone is willing to answer  as a comment is enough . Does this old style of coding inputoutput arguments have its name or any other expression with which it is referred p

Negative 38 pIm creating a .dll library in CC for VBA. It will contain functions for communication via RS232 serial port and data will be processed in Excel. Everything works fine but Im confused of strange behavior of VBA that works under Excel. I have 2 functions. One for writing to port one for reading. When Im sending a port number e.g. 3 from VBA to one of them, doesnt matter which one and print it exactly after it was received by function it shows decimal value of 3 what is correct. But when I send exactly the same variable that consists number 3 to second one, function receive 51 what is a decimal value of 3 char. So at first VBA send integer then it changes somehow and send decimal value of 3 char. There is no code before printing received variable in my functions that can change value.p  pHere is simplified code of my functions just to show.p  precodeint stdcall PortReadshort int amp Port    printfd   cn,Port,Port    return 0   int stdcall PortWriteshort int amp Port, BSTR amp Message    printfd   cn,Port,Port    return 0  codepre  pHere is VBA codep  precodeDeclare Function PortRead Lib rs232r.dll ByRef x As Integer As Integer Declare Function PortWrite Lib rs232w.dll ByRef x As Integer, ByRef y As String As Integer Dim Message As String Dim PortNumber As Integer  Sub Example PortNumber  3 Message  tracdata aa  PortWritePortNumber, Message Debug.Print aa xx  PortReadPortNumber Debug.Print xx End Sub codepre  pAs I said, passed values will be different when Im sending one variable to 2 functions but when I change it like the next example both functions will receive the same correct value.p  precodeDeclare Function PortRead Lib rs232r.dll ByRef x As Integer As Integer Declare Function PortWrite Lib rs232w.dll ByRef x As Integer, ByRef y As String As Integer Dim Message As String Dim PortNumber1 As Integer Dim PortNumber2 As Integer Dim Number As Integer  Sub Example Number  3 PortNumber1  Number PortNumber2  Number Message  tracdata aa  PortWritePortNumber1, Message Debug.Print aa xx  PortReadPortNumber2 Debug.Print xx End Sub codepre  pI apology if this question has been already asked or if it is question for programmers from kindergarten but I am very curious.

Negative 38 pFor my augmented reality project, I have a 3D model viewed using VTK camera and a real object of the model viewed using a real camera. p  pI used EPnP to estimate the extrinsic matrix of the real camera this camera has already been calibrated before hand, so I know the internal parameters by giving 3D points from VTK and its corresponding 2D points from real camera image and the internal parameters of the real camera for the EPnP algorithm to work. p  pAfter that, I obtained a rotation and translation matrix with the elements  R1, R2, R3, ....., R9 and t1, t2 and t3. p  pSo my extrinsic matrix of the real camera looks like this lets call this extrinsicRealp  precodeR1 R2 R3 T1 R4 R5 R6 T2 R7 R8 R9 T3  0  0  0  1 codepre  pAfter this, I estimate the extrinsic matrix of my VTK camera using the following codep  precodevtkSmartPointerltvtkMatrix4x4gt extrinsicVTK  vtkSmartPointerltvtkMatrix4x4gtNew extrinsicVTKgtDeepCopyrenderergtGetActiveCameragtGetViewTransformMatrix codepre  pTo fuse the VTK camera 3D model with the real camera, the VTK camera should be set to a position which is same as that of the real camera position and the focal length of the VTK camera should be same as that of the real camera. Another important step is to apply the same extrinsic matrix of the real camera to the VTK camera. How do I do itp  pWhat I did was I took the inverse of the extrinsicReal and multiplied this with the extrinsicVTK to get a new 44 matrix lets call it newMatrix. I applied this matrix for the transformation of VTK camera.p  precodevtkSmartPointerltvtkMatrix4x4gt newMatrix  vtkSmartPointerltvtkMatrix4x4gtNew vtkMatrix4x4Multiply4x4extrinsicRealInvert,extrinsicVTK,newMatrix  vtkSmartPointerltvtkTransformgt transform  vtkSmartPointerltvtkTransformgtNew transformgtSetMatrixNewM  transformgtUpdate  renderergtGetActiveCameragtApplyTransformtransform codepre  pI am not really sure if this is the correct method. But I checked the real camera position which I got after EPnP and the VTK camera position after applying the transform above and they are both exactly same. Also, the orientation of the real camera and the direction of projection of the VTK camera are also the same. p  pThe problem is that even after the above parameters are matching for both the VTK and the real camera, the 3D VTK model does not seem to be perfectly aligned to the real camera video. Can someone guide me step by step to debug the issue  p

Negative 38 pHello  I have recently started developing using jQuery and am making some good progress. However, I have an issue that I seem unable to find a solution for. The only hits I get seem to indicate a general problem with the Draggable widget in MSIE, so I am hoping I am wrong.p  pThe problem When I drag an element that is draggable in MSIE, the browser itself scrolls its window to the top of the element. So, say, I drag it all the way down as to be almost out of sight... what it does next is scroll down making sure that the element is 100 in the picture and the entire rest of the page scrolls with it. This does not happen in Firefox or Chrome, where I can simply park the element anywhere I want, with the page not moving at all. strongBasically it is as if after the dragaction, it executes a focus action on the justdragged element.strong This only happens in MSIE, both version 9 and 11.p  pHas anyone experienced this behavior as well, and what can be done about it, if anything Its quite a dealbreaker actually, since most of our customers use MSIE 9 even.... and this makes dragging somewhat useless and annoying p  pI have just tried the 1.11 release  same result. Also stripped down the page to the bare essentials and still no dice. The code I am using is below. I have added the table with numbers so it is easy to see that the page just autoscrolls when I move the purple div outside of the page. Just to be clear though  I understand that it will scroll if I keep dragging the DIV far away... but in MSIE it also moves even when a small portion of the draggable div is outside the window. In Chrome it only starts to scroll right or down when the entire div would be out of the main window which is finep  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt  ltHtmlgt ltTitlegtTESTltTitlegt    ltlink relstylesheet hrefcode.jquery.comui1.11.1themessmoothnessjqueryui.cssgt   ltscript srccode.jquery.comjquery1.10.2.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srccode.jquery.comui1.11.1jqueryui.jsgtltscriptgt  ltmeta contenttexthtml charsetUTF8 httpequivcontenttypegt ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIEedgegt ltmeta charsetiso88592gt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt document.readyfunction  .draggable.draggable  ltscriptgt  ltHeadgt  ltBodygt  ltDiv Classdraggable Stylepositionabsoluteleft30pxtop40pxwidth400pxheight200pxbackgroundAA0090gtHENKltDivgt  ltTablegt  ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt1ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt2ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt3ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt4ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt5ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt6ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt7ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt8ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt9ltTdgtltTrgt ltTrgtltTd Styleheight300pxgt10ltTdgtltTrgt ltTablegt  ltBodygt  ltHtmlgt codepre

Negative 38 pI am currently building a cryptocurrency trading platform in Python, and using Autobahn for receiving market events. I am experiencing an issue with using subscription options.p  pWhen I create a subscription with just the handler, topic arguments, and make the handler take a single argument, everything works fine. However, when I create the subscription using the handler, topic, options arguments, and make the handler take two arguments, the handler does not get called.

I have tried, in desperation, everything between 0 and 5 arguments.p  pIn short, when I use no subscription options and give the handler one argument, it works fine.

Negative 38 pI am currently working on an app in Xcode. Im having the following problem I have created a 6060 pixel image in Adobe Photoshop with a transparant background.

I have tried the same thing with a different .png file that wasnt made with Adobe Photoshop, and this image did appear in the iOS Simulator, so the problem clearly has to do with the image and not with the positioning or coding. p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 38   h2Motivationh2  pI created a header file which wraps Matlabs mex functionality in c11 classes especially for MxNxC images. Two functions I created are forEach, which iterates over each pixel in the image, and also a forKernel, which given a kernel and pixel in the image, iterates over the kernel around that pixel, handling all kinds of nifty, boilerplate indexing mathematics.p  pThe idea is that one could program slidingwindows like thisp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeimage.forEach[]Image ampimage, sizet row, sizet col    kr and lc specify which pixel is the center of the kernel   image.forKernelltdoublegtrow, col, kernel, kr, kc, []Image ampimage, double w, sizet row, sizet col       w is the weightcoefficient of the kernel, rowcol are the corresponding coordinates in the image.      process ...     codepre  h2Problemh2  pThis provides a nice way top  ul liincrease readability the two function calls are a lot clearer than the corresponding 4 forloops to do the same,li listay flexible lambda functions allow you to scope all kinds of variables by value or reference, which are invisible to the implementer of forEach  forKernel, andli liincrease execution time, unfortunately this executes around 8x slower than using just for loops.li ul  pThe latter point is the problem, of course. I was hoping g would be able to optimize the lambdafunctions out and inline all the code. This does not happen.

The good thing is that one can compile once and link to it more often with different lambda functions, but the bad thing is that it is slow.p  pMoreover, the situation discussed in the motivation already contains templates for the data type double, int, ..., hence the good thing is overruled anyway.p  pA fast way to implement the previous would be like thisp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfunctionalgt  struct Data    sizet dsize   double ddata   Datasizet size  dsizesize, ddatanew double[size]    Data  delete[] ddata    double ampoperator[]sizet i  return ddata[i]      int main    sizet len  50000000   Data imlen   for sizet index  0 index  len index     im[index]  staticcastltdoublegtindex    double sum  0   for sizet index  0 index  len index     sum  im[index]    stdcout ltlt sum ltlt n  codepre  psource a hrefhttpideone.comUajMMz relnofollowhttpideone.comUajMMzap  pIt is about 8x faster, but also less readable, especially when we consider more complicated structures like images with kernels.p  h2Questionh2  pIs there a way to provide the lambda function as a template argument, such that forEach is compiled for each call, and optimized for each specific instance of the lambda function Can the lambda function be inlined somehow, since lambda functions are typically not recursive this should be trivial, but what is the syntaxp  pI found some related postsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8611756whyclambdaisslowerthanordinaryfunctionwhencalledmultipletimesWhy C lambda is slower than ordinary function when called multiple timesali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18619035understandingtheoverheadoflambdafunctionsinc11Understanding the overhead of lambda functions in C11ali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3218821c0xlambdaoverheadC0x Lambda overheadali ul  pBut they do not give a solution in the form of a minimal working example, and they do not discuss the possibility of inlining a lambda function.

Negative 38 pI have inherited an application which works but I would like to add to it. What I would like to do is merge from the first to the 4th or 5th Cell on the 2nd Row. The template has been created in word and by using bookmarks the application replaces those words with information from the program. The 2nd rowtechnically 3rd but I am ignoring the header only uses 2 of the possible 6 cells with the first cell being mostly text thus making it barely readable. It replaces the bookmarks on a row to row basis. The table is part of the template and not made via the code.p  pAn issue is it is using WordTLB which I am not accustomed to and have searched around for a couple of days for a valid fix to my problem. The closest I have gotten is merging all the cells on the row.p  pAnyways I will put some code snippets with regards to the what I think is relevant and can always update with more background code if needs be.p  pVariables used in the function In the event I am missing something obviousp  precodevar   FColumns  TStringList   MSTables  ITables   MSTable   ITable   MSRow, MSRow2     IRow   MSCell    ICell   MSCell2   ICell   C         Integer   TRow      IRow   OleRow    OleVariant   OleCell   OleVariant begin   for C  1 to MSRow.Cells.Count do  Add the text  on a cell by cell basis   begin     MSCell  MSRow.Cells.ItemC     FColumns.AddMSCell.Range.Text     MSCell  Nil   end codepre  pHere is where the actual row is filled.

If it finds the bookmarks then it switches the text.p  pThis approach does not seem to be working. I think it is because it is the range of the row, however I am unsure of how to get from one cell to another so that I can merge everything in between.p  pIf I just do TRow.Cells.Merge that method merges all the cells on the row.p

Negative 38 pI am creating a dynamic search so when the user types a letter the code should search through the results to see all the words that involve the string in the textbox. Is there a way to make it so that I can have the search only happen after the last letter is typed opposed to every time a key is pressed because its taking too long. Basically is there a way to give handlers execution priority that isnt just by when they were created or is there a way for one handler to terminate previous ones Thanks p

Negative 38 pI am collecting stats for a small library. p  pI have people completing Google forms when they check out books. I have one field where they enter the call number for each book they borrow. These call numbers fall into three major classifications and take the following form REF.XX.YYYY, FA.XX.YYYY, AA.XX.YYYY where X and Y are a combination of letters and numerals.  The result in the spreadsheet would look something like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoHax2.png relnofollowTableap  pa hrefhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd1oc2AJFoVmBw5tqN7629BXWF0nsaDdwTsLQLleqQXKUedit relnofollowShared tableap  pI am trying to come up with a way to count the number of instances each classification designation comes up REF, FA, or AA throughout the column.

Negative 38 pI have 3 UITableViews in a class one of the tableViews is programmatically created in a  UIPopover where I assign it a tag.  In cellForRowAtIndexPath, I check the tag each tableView and configure the tableView depending on the tag id.p  pThe problem is the popover is not created until emafterem cellForRowAtIndexPath is called.

Negative 38 pIve always been a backend CC developer. Working on a Java project Netbeans, and I am trying to figure out how to do the frontendUI. While I am a pretty good backend dev, I havent really been keeping up with the latest and greatest in frameworks, etc. for the frontend.p  pThe Java backend component can communicate with JSON over websockets. I am trying to figure out what frontend framework I should use. I also dont want to recreate my project, and would just like to add to my current Maven web application project.p  pSo whats the verdict Whats hip and cool these days HTML5 JQueryUI are they even mutually exclusivep  pShould also mention that I just want to make a quick UI, bc I am planning on handing off the task to another programmer for a proper frontend component later on. At the same time, I do want my version to be decent. So, in a nutshell, I want something that is easy to use, but still capable.p  pThanks p

I am using the androidwindowSoftInputModeadjustPan and its working perfectly on my cheap Forcebook UltraTab 7 with 4.2.2 Android, but on my Samsung gtp5100 with 4.1.2 Android when the soft keyboard shows the layout pans nicely but as soon as i try moving it around or start typing on the keyboard the list looses focus, as well as the EditText inside it.p  pIf im editing the last element of the list it drops down behind the keyboard and i cant see it anymore.  As i said, the problem doesnt happen on the smaller device although they are both using the same layout.p  pEditp  pNow i have also noticed that if the editText i try editing is low on the screen, the screen moves up for a certain number of dp, and when i start typing it goes down for the exact same amount of dp. So actually the resizing is canceled. I still dont know why it happens.p  pEditp  pApparently EditText fields arent suppposed to be used inside ListViews and that creates all the problems with the keyboard not working as it should. In the end i swaped the ListView for a LinearLayout which i dynamically filled with the appropriate data and it works like a charm.  Even creating an adapter for the linearLayout isnt as hard as I imagined so please give it a go before you go mad with the list p

Negative 38 pNot sure if Stackoverflow is the right place to get the answer from.p  pHere is the deal. I get .ovpn profile files attached to an email and I open the email with Mail app in iOS. Tapping on the attachment used to open up a menu so I had the possibilty to choose the OpenVPN app. But recently, for some reasone, tapping the attachment goes right into the ovpn file and shows the content as text. Is there anything I can revert this or remove the default app in this case Mail text editorp
Negative 38 pI have some protein expression data from 850 proteins and I would like to normalize the data to a reference protein. It is a good way to correct for technical errors.

Negative 38 pIf you want to get to the actual question, scroll to the bottom of the question. I just felt it necessary to explain the circumstances.p  h2State of affairsh2  pIn our company we have, for historical reasons, several version control systems. Currently we are trying to move to emanyem a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgpubsoftwarescmgitdocsgitfastimport.html relnofollowcodegitfastimportcodeacompatible distributed version control system, really, but our pick is Mercurial at the moment. I say at the moment, because once you have taken that step, its easier to migrate from one DVCS to another in most cases.p  pWe have essentially three code bases that we want to join plus a part that has been committed into one SVN repository, which we want to separate out.p  pSo we havep  ol lian ancient CVS repositoryli lione huge 26 GiB SVN repository with nearly 7000 revisions containing a lot of code, some experimental code and actual junk to be filtered out during conversion and the build products from various releases  which are meant to get separated out into a repository or even just folder structure of their ownli lione SVN repository containing related code, but sharing no files with the other two think of it as getting spliced in as a folderli ol  pThe huge repo strong2.strong contains snapshots of the state of the CVS repo strong1.strong at different points in time. Obviously none have been tagged in the CVS repo, because thatd be potentially useful. On top of that the snapshots have patches applied on top of that snapshot state.p  pThis is to say that a subfolder hierarchy in strong2.strong corresponds roughly to strong1.strong. However, there is no need to worry about it, as the idea is to retire either one of those folders after initially splicing them under distinct path names. So no naming clashes to be expected here.p  h2What Ive done so farh2  ul liAfter some research I picked a hrefhttpwww.catb.orgesrreposurgeon relnofollowcodereposurgeoncodea as my tool of choice. This is a very powerful tool allowing, indeed, surgical operations on codegitfastimportcode streams. I warmly recommend it to anybody tasked with similar migrations.li liThe conversion of the huge repository is fully covered by now. Files and folders have been expunged and old symbols removed. Kinks have been ironed out and stuff like closing a branch in SVN and later reopening it from another revision under the same name have been fixed such that they appear continuous. Basically all the surgical operations have been done. the result is 350 MiB as a codegitfastimportcode stream, btwli liThe smaller SVN repository is mostly covered as well, although some minor tasks remain. However, due to my experiences from the huge SVN repo, Im confident this is a matter of only a few hours.li liLast but not least the CVS repository. I have tried a number of different tools, including the codecvsfastexportcode, now maintained by Eric S. Raymond, also the author of codereposurgeoncode. I have also contemplated conversion to SVN, just to find that the toolset codecvs2svncode used to do that has been extended to export to Mercurial as well.li ul  h2The problemh2  pWhile the SVN conversions took a long time to get to the point where we can call it done, the CVS conversion is still in progress.p  pSince CVS doesnt have a repositorywide revision history all tools have to attempt to parse the RCS files and make sense of their contents to piece together the puzzle.p  pSome of the really bad scars I was able to remove manually by literally editing the locked RCS file in an editor after taking backups. This way some invalid revisions RCS and CVS have a different idea of what is a valid revision number as well as symbols that appeared as tags in some files and as branches in others have been weeded out.p  pI am also able to preprocess the CVS repository to remove a lot of the branches and tags which we do not need, prior to the branches we are interested in codercsfile.pycode from a hrefhttpsgithub.comryanakcarcsgrep relnofollowcodercsgrepcodea helped. Basically prior to that certain point, we only want the contents of codeMAINcodecodetrunkcodecodedefaultcodecodemastercode, whatever you want to call it.p  pHowever, some of the tools outright fail e.g. codecvsfastexportcode crashes and others give results that are somewhat mangled.p  pNot too bad, one can demangle a lot by means on codereposurgeoncode. However, half a dozen of branches never even make it to the converted repository.p  pThe reason appears to be in all cases that all tools get confused by a particular peculiarity you wouldnt find in SVN, for example.p  pIf branch tags get moved forcibly codecvs tag Bcode, then the originally allocated branch number in the RCS file gets orphaned and another new branch number will take its place. However, the old revisions remain in the file.p  pNow the new branch started perhaps hours, days or months after the original branching took place. This appears to be what upsets all those tools.p  pWhile it would be cool to also include the orphaned branches and mend those wounds, its not a priority. Most of the files treated with codecvs tag Bcode are not source files, but files like codeGNUmakefilecode or other project files.p  pHowever, the problem remains, that the CVS conversion isnt finished and will take some more time.p  pAnd managers grow impatient ...p  h2The questionh2  pIs it possible to start out with the two SVN repositories spliced into a single Hg repository and later when the CVS conversion is finished splice in those changes strongwithoutstrong having to initialize yet another unrelated Hg repop  pThe CVS repo splicing would strongnotstrong cause conflicting paths, I have to say up front. The other repository is meant to be spliced in via its own subdirectory, so no name clashes.p  pI know that pushes and pulls can introduce commits from two years ago into someones repository today. However, does this mean that a codehg transplantcode would be likely to succeed as well I.e. can I expect to be able to transplant those commits from a decade ago into the joint Hg repositoryp  pThis way I could split the migration into stages.p  ol liconsolidate the two SVN repos into one Hg repo  basically emnowemli lisplice in the converted to Hg CVS repo in a few weeksmonths from nowli ol  pIs this emtechnicallyem feasible by means of codehg transplantcode or any other codehgcode extensions for that matterp  pIf it is, Ill appreciate any advice about potential caveats as well.p

To do that I installed some tools like Checkstyle, PMD and findBugs but Im not an expert in those code quality analyzers and I dont know how to configure all the rules. In particular I dont know if there is a rule to check this requirement given by my company emInherit level must be 6 or below. Long inheritance tree makes the code very difficult to read, understand, maintain and refactor. Most of inheritance cases can be covered by implementing an interface and using composition which is easier to maintain.em  Is there a manner to do this check  Tnxp

Negative 38 pI read about git and its behaviour, and I tried a little experiment with tortoise git. Now Im not sure to really understand the git basics, and specifically on the places of workspaceindexlocalReporemoteRepo ...p  pIt is my understanding that a best practice is to separate the workspace from the codelocalRepositorycode.p  pSo with tortoiseGit, I create a bare repo codelocalRepo.gitcode. I also created separated codeworkspacecode and codeworkspace2code directories. In each one, I cloned the repo.p  pAt this point, I thought that creating a new file in codeworkspacecode, and codecommitcode it should make it appear on the Repobrowser of codelocalRepo.gitcode, unfortunately it is not the case...p  pIn fact, I had to do a codepushcode, to be able to see it in repobrowser, and get it in codeworkspace2code for instancep  pSo here is my problem, I thought the codepushcode operations aim was to put my modifications to the remote repository, but here I think that codelocalRepo.gitcode is my local repository....p  pBasicaly, I think I dont understand if there is a difference between a local and a remote repository.p
Negative 38 pI want to import a class that I made in Eclipse to a project in Android Studio. I have been working on a project in Eclipse which involves a custom class called codeWordListcode and I have serialized an instance of this class into a binary file. p  pNow, I have just started to learn about android programming and I wanted to make an app that uses this file. I want to use something like this to read the codeWordListcode object from that filep  pcodeObjectInputStream in  new ObjectInputStream                     new FileInputStreamnew File file name  return WordList in.readObjectcodep  pBut in order to do that, the program of course needs to know about the codeWordListcode class, otherwise Ill get a codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode at the cast. What I did first was to create a new codeWordListcode class in the Android project that was just an exact copy of the one in the Eclipse project, but then I got that exception p  pcodejava.lang.ClassNotFoundException Didnt find class packagename.WordList on path DexPathList[[zip file dataappmyprojectdirectory2base.apk],nativeLibraryDirectories[vendorlib, systemlib]]code. p  pSo apparently, these two identical codeWordListcode classes are in fact not identical. Why is it so Is there a way for me to import the class from the Eclipse project into the Android Studio project, so that I actually can use the very same class Or is there a way to make the program realize that the file actually contains a serialized codeWordListcode objectp

Which entity is regarded as the issuer of the Claim Is this hybrid approach, adding Claims to Identities authenticated via external issuers, an accepted approach I cant see how else to extend the limited information provided by Google which works great for Identity, other than manually adding Claims from within our own enterprise to these externallyauthenticated users.p  pIncidentally, every Claim found in ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Claims shows the Issuer and OriginalIssuer as LOCAL AUTHORITY...nothing about Google.p

From that, can somebody provide me with a solid example of what Im trying to accomplish  I hesitate requesting a good tutorial because of the policy about thatp  pemSo, in a nutshell, what I need to know isemp  pstrong1strong How to Load the data from the text fields into my classesobjects.p  pstrong2strong How to populate the qtablewidgets with the data from the classesobjects.p  pNote  This is for a Testing class VampV, so Qt is not the project.  The code Ive completed is what is important, so nothing Im requesting here breaches any ethics.  We just require a GUI for the harness.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4f5NI.png altGradeBook GUI Screenshotp
Negative 38 pI have a site with virtual pages where any request is rewrote to the index page in this wayp  precodeRewriteEngine On   RewriteCond SCRIPTFILENAME d   RewriteCond SCRIPTFILENAME f   RewriteRule . .index.php codepre  pI.e, a hrefhttpwww.example.comjobedit relnofollowhttpwww.example.comjobedita is rewrote as a hrefhttpwww.example.comindex.phpjobedit relnofollowhttpwww.example.comindex.phpjobedita where I parse it. That works great.p  pNow, I need to process every virtual subdomain in order that i.e. a hrefhttpuser1.example.comjobedit relnofollowhttpuser1.example.comjobedita becomes a hrefhttpwww.example.comindex.phpuser1jobedit relnofollowhttpwww.example.comindex.phpuser1jobedita.p  pI added in CPanel a wildcard subdomain code.example.comcode, so every subdomain is pointed to the domain folder without it I got Server not found on every subdomain.p  pI tried every example that I found here, but I cant get them to work. If I print out codeSERVER[REQUESTURI]code on the index page, I allways get the last part, but not the subdomain i.e. codejobeditcode.p  pIs there any way of doing thisp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEditstrong I already have a workaround for doing it. The codeSERVER[HTTPHOST]code var contains the whole domain, i.e. codeuser1.example.comcode. I can parse it in PHP and extract the subdomain, but I think it should be a more elegant way of doing it.p

Negative 38 pI am implementing a comment box and using the a hrefhttpnoraesae.github.ioperfectscrollbar relnofollowperfectscrollbara plugin in order to implement the scrolling functionality. Whenever I load my page, which is built using angular I have dummy comment text that populates the inside of the comment box.

I feel like this is something trivial but cant really work it out just yet. Rendering straight to the screen still works fine.p  p FURTHER to comments from others i addedp  pi think i understand the problem and found a workaround for it [not very elegant tho]. Basically, the first pass writes using stencil to textures[0] of framebuffers[0], and the 2nd pass writes to textures[1] of framebuffers[1] using renderbuffers[0] of framebuffers[0], but not textures[0]. Hence i end up with just a small white[instead of green] square surrounded by a red one. Since, i cant blit, ive realised that i can just draw twice in the first pass as per the belowp  precode.... gl.drawElementsgl.TRIANGLES, 6, gl.UNSIGNEDSHORT, 0  ifprogId9               gl.bindFramebuffergl.FRAMEBUFFER, framebuffers[1]         gl.drawElementsgl.TRIANGLES, 6, gl.UNSIGNEDSHORT, 0      codepre  pThis works but looks very ugly Is there any other wayp  pWhen it comes to render the final texture to the screen, it seems like i dont have to do much, ie i only send the color buffer to the screen and not the stencil amp depth buffer and all the final texture gets displayed as expected.p  pAlso, note that my fragment shaders are only doing the belowp  pshader9 codeglFragColor  vec40.0,1.0,0.0,1.0codep  pshader8 codeglFragColor  vec41.0,vec20.0,1.0codep  pshader6 codeglFragColor   texture2DuTexture0,vTextureCoord codep

Negative 38 pI embedded lua into my project and came across a strange for me behavior of codestrlencode and lua interpreting. I was trying to load a string, containing lua code, with codeluaLloadbuffercode and it consistently threw error of codeunexpected symbolcode on whatever was the last line of the lua code, except if the whole chunk was written in one line. so for example p  precode  function start       printstart   end codepre  pwould always results error unexpected symbol on 3rd line, butp  precodefunction start printstart end codepre  ploads successfully.p  pI figured out that loading the same chunk with codeluaLloadstringcode, gives no errors, and saw that it uses codestrlencode to determine the length of the specified string I used codestdstringsizecode and also that using strlen to provide the length of the string to the codeluaLloadbuffercode also results in successful loading.p  pNow the question was what may be the difference between strlen and stdstringsize, and at my most surprise the answer is that strlen is not counting new lines codencode. That isp  precode const char str   this is a stringnthis is a newline   stdstring str2str   str2.size  gives 34   strlenstr  gives 33 codepre  pThe difference between the size, and the value returned by strlen was always the number of new line characters.p  pMy questions arep  ol liDoes strlen really not counting newlines or I am missing something  li liHow do newlines affect the interpretation of the lua code internallyli ol  pI am using vs 2015 and lua 5.3.0p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMy first example was not exact, and did not produce the detailed effect for me neither, but I was able to recreate the problem from the original codep  precodestdfstream Streamtest.lua, stdiosate  stdiosin     stdstring Source     ifStream.isopen          Source.resizeStream.tellg         Stream.seekg0, stdiosbeg         Stream.readampSource[0], Source.size         Stream.close           stdcout ltlt stdstringsize   ltlt Source.size ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt strlen   ltlt strlenSource.cstr ltlt stdendl codepre  pThe content of test.lua is codefunction startntprintstartnendnnstartcodep  pThe difference is the number of newlinesp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comy0QOW.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comy0QOW.pngap
Negative 38 pIm suddenly getting the Bad Request 400 error when using the Azure Storage Emulator when trying to CreateIfNotExists. The Response on the Inner Exception says The value for one of the HTTP headers is not in the correct format. All the tables exist, the data is in the tables, everything was working up until an update to my NuGet packages. Looking around SO it seems like a common cause is an update to Azure Storage Client Library now at 5.0.0 that creates a mismatch. I updated the Azure SDK to 2.6 since I have VS2012. This brings the Storage Emulator up to 4.0.0.0, but still no luck...same error. This is kind of a bad thing that suddenly an update to a package of a package of a package causes the whole thing to break and completely kills my rather large project. Any ideas p

Negative 38 pIm working on a game with serverauthoritative multiplayer, and as such the server calculates player positions in realtime on every tick and replicates them to all clients.p  pExamplep  precodevar broadcastRate  60 var lastBroadcast  0 function tick       var deltaTime  clock.getDelta     lastBroadcast  deltaTime      var newPositions  recalculatePositionsdeltaTime       Broadcast updates 60 times per second     if lastBroadcastbroadcastRate gt 1          io.sockets.emitupdate, newPositions         lastBroadcast  0           setImmediatetick  codepre  pIn addition, the server handles socket.on events from players telling the server their new direction.p  pIn addition to the above Im keeping track of the servers tick rate, which drops as more players join due to calculatePositions taking longer or as the games geometry becomes more complex due to collision detection taking longer.p  pI noticed that when the tick rate drops too low, around lt1000, the socket.on and the socket.emit events start becoming significantly delayed and do not fire right away when called. This causes a huge several second delay in the client receiving an updated position from the server upon pressing a key, even with a ping of zero.p  pThis shouldnt be the case a server with a tick rate even of only 100 should perform just fine, so Im wondering what is causing the delay in socket events firing Does this have something to do with setImmediatetick, or do I need to change something with the sockets to force them to fire immediatelyp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 38 pIm doing an a hrefhttpwww.cs.ecu.edukarl3675fall15AssignmentsAssn2assn2.html relnofollowassignmenta in Cinnameg that requires me to perform several operations on binary numbers represented as lists including one that will compare them and return a character such that compareIntsx, y will return  if x  y, lt if x lt y, or  if x  y. What I am not completely sure about is how to make the comparison when it comes to binary numbers. I am not allowed to convert them to integers first the whole point of the assignment is to be able to do arithmetic on integers that are too large to be stored normally. The only thing I can think of is that the number with the larger number of digits is probably larger, but that does not help if the two numbers have the same number of digits. Also if it matters we are only allowed to use the equational programming style of Cinnameg.p
