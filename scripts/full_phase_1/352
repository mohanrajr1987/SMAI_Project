Positive 352 pI am working with NHibernate right now, and am coming across a problem trying to improve the data bandwidth efficiency of what im working on.p  pThe context is I am making a data event editor, which has a listview populated with events. These events have 3 types, each is stored in its own MSSQL Table.p  pThere is a parent object, which contains lists of these 3 event types. Originally, I was just selecting all the parents and loading the events underneath it, but if you had say 20 parents, then it would run 60 querys or so to load the list.p  pI have changed it now to run just 3 querys, one to select all of each event type between date X and date Y. This date is set with some DateTime pickers on the form.p  pNow, I am trying to print the name of the parent in the list too, but because I never visited the parent during the nHibernate, I only have a proxy object and it causes a crash.

As these clientspecific assemblies are generated and stored outside of the bin folder, we are using an assembly resolution event handler which is set towards the beginning of the applications initialization.p  precodeAppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve  new ResolveEventHandlerClassLoaderUtil.MyAssemblyResolver codepre  pThe point at which NHibernate is throwing the exception occurs when we attempt to add a resource to an NHibernate Configuration cfgp  precodestring assemblyName  DataServiceUtil.ClientDataModelAssemblyName string resourceName  string.Format0.Mappings.1.2.hbm.xml, DataServiceUtil.ClientDataModelNamespace, dinfo.subns, attSet.Name System.Reflection.Assembly assembly  ClassLoaderUtil.LoadAssemblyassemblyName cfg.AddResourceresourceName, assembly codepre  pWere using our assembly resolver classes to load the assembly that gets passed into cfg.AddResource.

When I enabled fusion logging, I saw it only tried looking in the bin folder and in the temporary Asp.net folders but didnt use any of the custom folders that our assembly resolver checks in. Am I incorrect in assuming that System.Type.GetType should still use the assembly resolver when being called by NHibernate p

Positive 352 pI need an ORM that is suitable for stateful application. Im going to keep entities between requests in lowlatency realtime game server with persistent client connections. There is an only 1 server instance connected to database so no data can be changed from outside and the server can rely on its cache.p  pWhen user remotely logs in to the server its whole profile is loaded to server memory. Several higherlevel services are also created for each user to operate profile data and provide functionality. They can also have internal fields state to store temporary data. When user wants to change his signature he asks corresponding service to do so. The service tracks how frequently user changes his signature and allows it only once per ten minutes for example  such short interval is not tracked in db, this is a temporary state. This change should be stored to db executing only 1 query codeUPDATE users SET signature  ... WHERE userid  ...code. When user logs off its unloaded from server memory after minuteshours of inactivity. Db here is only a storage. This is what I call stateful.p  ol liSome entities are considered static data and loaded only once at application start. Those can be referenced from other dynamic entities. Loading dynamic entity should not require reloading referenced static data entity.li licodeUpdatecodecodeInsertcodecodeDeletecode should setinsertdelete only changed propertiesentities even with detached entity.li liWrite operations should not each time load data from database perform codeSelectcode preliminary to detect changes. A state can be tracked in dynamically generated inheritor. I have a state locally, there is no sense to load anything. strongI want to continue tracking changes even outside of connection scope and upload changes when I want.strongli liWhile performing operations references of persisted objects should not be changed.li liDBConnectionperuser is not going to work. The expected online is thousands of users.li liEntities from static data can be assigned to dynamic enitity properties which represent foreign keys and codeUpdatecode should handle it correctly.li ol  pNow Im using NHibernate despite its designed for stateless applications. It supports reattaching to session but that looks like very uncommon usage, requires me to use undocumented behavior and doesnt solve everything.p  pIm not sure about Entity Framework  can I use it that way Or can you suggest another ORMp  pIf the server will recreate or especially reload user objects each time user hits a button it will eat CPU very fast. CPU scales vertically expensively but have small effect. Contrary if you are out of RAM you can just go and buy more  like with horizontal scaling but easier to code. If you think that another approach should be used here Im ready to discuss it. p

Positive 352 pIn my asp.net mvc application session factory is cached on application level. Than new session is created and closed on each request.  Unfortunately logging service which is subscribed on PostUpdate, PostInsert events of the session factory requires current user id. Thus it is created in request scope. So its possible that more than one instance of the logging service exists at the same time and listen events from the session factorysession in case if more than one request is handled at the same time. As a result changes of one user will raise event on session factory which will be stored by all existing instances of the logger service.p  pThe solution could be subscribing on session rather than on session factory. This will shrink scope of the logger services dependencies to a single requests scope.p  pMy questions is Is there any way to register event listener for particular nhibernate session rather than for whole session factoryp

Negative 352 pIm writing a financial application in C where performance i.e. speed is critical. Because its a financial app I have to use the Decimal datatype intensively. p  pIve optimized the code as much as I could with the help of a profiler. Before using Decimal, everything was done with the Double datatype and the speed was several times faster. However, Double is not an option because of its binary nature, causing a lot of precision errors over the course of multiple operations.p  pIs there any decimal library that I can interface with C that could give me a performance improvement over the native Decimal datatype in .NETp  pBased on the answers I already got, I noticed I was not clear enough, so here are some additional detailsp  ul liThe app has to be as fast as it can possibly go i.e. as fast as it was when using Double instead of Decimal would be a dream. Double was about 15x faster than Decimal, as the operations are hardware based.li liThe hardware is already topnotch Im running on a Dual Xenon QuadCore and the application uses threads, so CPU utilization is always 100 on the machine. Additionally, the app is running in 64bit mode, which gives it a mensurable performance advantage over 32bit.li liIve optimized past the point of sanity more than one month and a half optimizing believe it or not, it now takes approx. 15000 of what it took to do the same calculations I used as a reference initially this optimization involved everything string processing, IO, database access and indexes, memory, loops, changing the way some things were made, and even using switch over if everywhere it made a difference. The profiler is now clearly showing that the remaining performance culprit is on the Decimal datatype operators. Nothing else is adding up a considerable amount of time.li liYou have to believe me here Ive gone as far as I could possibly go in the realm of C.NET to optimize the application, and Im really amazed at its current performance. Im now looking for a good idea in order to improve Decimal performance to something close to Double. I know its only a dream, but just wanted to check I thought of everything possible. li ul  pThanksp

Negative 352 pIm trying to figure out how to correctly use Javas Executors.  I realize submitting tasks to an codeExecutorServicecode has its own overhead.

Most of the calculations are fairly simple arithmetic operations.p  pI tried to test something very simple codeMath.random  Math.randomcodep  pThe simplest test runs this computation in a simple loop.  The second test does the same computation inside a anonymous Runnable this is supposed to measure the cost of creating new objects.  The third test passes the codeRunnablecode to an codeExecutorServicecode this measures the cost of introducing executors.p  pI ran the tests on my dinky laptop 2 cpus, 1.5 gig ramp  precodein milliseconds simpleCompuation47 computationWithObjCreation62 computationWithObjCreationAndExecutors422 codepre  pabout once out of four runs, the first two numbers end up being equalp  pNotice that executors take far, far more time than executing on a single thread.  The numbers were about the same for thread pool sizes between 1 and 8.p  pQuestion Am I missing something obvious or are these results expected  These results tell me that any task I pass in to an executor must do some nontrivial computation.  If I am processing millions of messages, and I need to perform very simple and cheap transformations on each message, I still may not be able to use executors...trying to spread computations across multiple CPUs might end up being costlier than just doing them in a single thread.

Negative 352 pIm using Electro in Lua for some 3D simulations, and Im running in to something of a mathematicalalgorithmicphysics snag.p  pIm trying to figure out how I would find the spin of a sphere of a sphere that is spinning on some axis. By spin I mean a vector along the axis that the sphere is spinning on with a magnitude relative to the speed at which it is spinning. The reason I need this information is to be able to slow down the spin of the sphere by applying reverse torque to the sphere until it stops spinning.p  pThe only information I have access to is the X, Y, and Z unit vectors relative to the sphere. That is, each frame, I can call three different functions, each of which returns a unit vector pointing in the direction of the sphere models local X, Y and Z axes, respectively. I can keep track of how each of these change by essentially keeping the previous value of each vector and comparing it to the new value each frame. The question, then, is how would I use this information to determine the spheres spin Im stumped.p  pAny help would be great. Thanksp

Negative 352 pI am building a web application that uses PHP 5, MySQL 5 and Javascript with jQuery and AJAX.p  pThe application is a quite complicated selection process with several pulldown menus that the user can select from in any order. Each select in a pulldown will give some more selection critera, that will limit the choices in the other pulldowns and finally give a limited result set.p  pI am using Javascript on the client side with AJAX connecting to PHP on the server and the MySQL database, the idea is that each time the user selects something from a pulldown I send a AJAX request to update all the other pulldowns. When all possible parameters have been set a result set will be presented.p  pI do want to keep the logic on the server side for various reasons, therefor using AJAX.p  pNow, I am not sure what is the best way to handle this iterative process for each userp  pI have a table with all the criteria that each selection result in. Since each pulldown selection will result in a set if selection criteria I could store a query string on the server that is being added to for each selection.  I then run the currently stored query string to find out what should go into each pulldown, send that data to the client, then store the query for later when more criteria will be added, run, send etc, etc... Then I have to store that query string on the server for each user, perhaps in a text file. Or perhaps as a stored procedure, see below....p  pAnother approach would be to just run the query with the new criteria when a selection is done, send the data to update the pulldowns, then store the selection in a temporary table that I run the next query on etc etc. So the temporary table will then shrink for each selection until I present the result.p  pThe app can have several users working at the same time, so must probably identify the users by cookiesession ID somehow....p  pAnd the stored query or temp table must die away after some time when each user leaves....howp  pSelection methods to add more and more criteria to select from a table, allowing for complicated calculations for selectionp  ul lipUsing joinpli lipUsing a temporary table that is being more and more limited as records are removed when new criteria are added.pli lipUsing subselections.pli ul  pStorage methods to keep on track between each step for each userp  ul lipStore parameters in a server file, and insert them into sql or stored procedure for each selection step, doing a new query on the whole database for each step, but each time with more criteria added.pli lipStore a sql query in a files, and extend it for each step....pli lipStore a sql query in a tablefield.....pli lipStore a sql query in a stored procedure .....pli lipStore the actual limited result set of previous selections for each user in a temopary table that will be smaller and smaller as more and more records are removed for each step.pli lipStore the parameters on the client side during the session, resending them all to the server for each selection pli ul  pCould anyone help with this decisionp  pRgds PMp

Im not using any IDE or significant library, just straight command line.p  pTangentially, is there something fundamental Im missing about programming in C I would think any language in common use today would have droves of webbased functionality, being so central to computer usage, but I can find next to no discussion on how to accomplish it. I realise C significantly predates the modern internet, so it lacking any core ability in the regard is reasonable, but the fact that relevant libraries seem so sparse is baffling.p  pThanks for your help.p
Negative 352 pWhat is the best way to manage cached articles when it comes to  keeping the read stateunread state in sync  Is there a property  inside the article feed that will tell me the state of the item  Im  trying to figure out how to keep the read state in sync, and if I need  to do a comparison of every cached article to the one on Google  Reader. p  pSo far Ive only been requesting unread items, so I exclude anything  thats already been marked as read.  However, I might have some cached  articles unread on the client that have been marked as read on Google  Reader.  Those articles wont be downloaded again, but Id like to  perhaps do a check on launch of each unread article, to see if it  should still be displayed as unread. p  pThanks for your time p

Negative 352 pIm starting the development of a Python application that provides a GUI for editing various graphical and numerical entities its a configuration and management tool for mobile robots, if you must know.

Negative 352 pI have seen one or two questions on testing Wpf bindings at Stackoverflow and have had a good look around on the web for examples of how this might be done.  I know some people feel that this is something that doesnt really need to be tested and can be tested visually, but I believe there is value in having unit tests to test your bindings.  As I couldnt find any example of how to do this, I have had a go at writing some code to do this.

Negative 352 pI have a fulltext search code that either uses faulty logic, or else it defies the way I understand PHP to work. First, I have a rather lengthy function called filefind that returns an array.

I end up with something like thisp  ul liCurrent file burnham.htmlli liCurrent file burroughs.htmlli liCurrent file burton.htmlli liCurrent file busch.htmlli liCurrent file busoni.htmlli liCurrent file butler.htmlli listrongReturned filestrong albeeli liCurrent file byrd.htmlli liCurrent file byrnes.htmlli liCurrent file byron.htmlli listrongReturned filestrong albeville etc.li ul  pIts all within the same if fileexists statement, so the code shouldnt even get to the if foreach searchresult ... until the filefind has finished. But apparently its running in the background and returning results after several other files have been sent to it and stack up. This wouldnt be a problem if I was printing all the results out at once, but I have AJAX sending batches of 100 files at a time, and its returning results all out of order, with As coming in after Bs and results being repeated when they shouldnt.p  pHow can I make sure it waits to proceed with the code until the filefind is finishedp

Negative 352 pFirst off, I use the term classes to mean functions with prototypes that might be in a separate file from the main initializing file for what Im working on.p  pNow for my questionissue Im working on building something in JavaScriptHTML5, and trying to program it properly ie. using prototypes with formats that are, I hope, standard. In my main JavaScript file, I have methods that have create use an instance basically the root instance of my OOPprototype based script that sets up the canvas.p  pI also have another file that is loaded which contains a class for creating clickable buttons. As of right now, Im just trying to get the buttons to draw on the canvas, however, I cant access the instance of the canvas because I believe the instance is out of scope which is fine, I dont want everything I do to contain a long dotnotation for referencing instances. However, this is giving me trouble when trying to draw a rectangle on the canvas, considering the class the button is in, isnt able to reference the context outside of it.p  pI found a way around this by using something along the lines ofp  precodefunction CreateButtonbtnx, btny, btnwidth, btnheight, btntxt        ... check and define parameters      CreateButton.prototype.customcanvas  document.getElementByIdrootcanvas     CreateButton.prototype.ctxt  this.customcanvas.getContext2d      CreateButton.prototype.ctxt.fillStyle  666666     CreateButton.prototype.ctxt.fillRectthis.x, this.y, this.width, this.height  codepre  pBasically, its writing on top of the canvas with a canvas of the same name Id assume that I can still manipulate the regular canvas afterwards and it would just act as if it was a single canvas element. I worried that redrawing on the canvas might use up a lot of memory when many things are added, however, no matter the method, writing on top of the canvas cant be avoided even when in the same scope.p  pAny suggestions, or help Or is my method of using the same canvas within a different class acceptablep  pThanks for any feedback.p  p[UPDATE] Hmm, maybe I should try passing the context as a parameter and just using that.p  p...Or should I just make the canvas a global object Any suggestionsp

Negative 352 pI am trying to figure out the best data structure to use for this problem. I am implementing a key value store with keys that are strings. The values get added frequently and will generally only get looked up 1 or 2 times. Initially I used an stdmap, but I found the performance to be unoptimal, as the overhead of adding keys and rebalancing the redblack tree, overshadowed the decrease in time to search for a value. Currently I am using a modified single linked list. It uses a struct that contains a c string const char , the length in bytes, and the value stored. When I want to find a value using a key I iterate through the list and compare the size of the keys, if they match I use memcmp to check if the strings are identical. If they are identical, I return the value. I way able to achieve about 10x greater performance using this method over the stdmap. I need to make it about 2x more efficient, however. Can anyone recommend a better type of data structure, for this problemp

Ive also noticed that on my development machine, which runs Window 7, the problem doesnt show up.  Im using .NET v3.5. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 352 pAfter dabbling in Chrome Extensions Ive noticed that when the data inside the Page Action gets to a certain point the scroll bars automatically attach themselves to the popup, this I expect.  However, instead of pushing the content to the left of the scroll bar it overlays the content causing a horizontal scrollbar to become active.  I ended up just adding a check on my data and applying a css class to push the content to the left more to run parallel to the scroll bar and beside it not under it.  What is the correct way to handle this besides my hackish solutionp

Negative 352 pI have a complex sync job that does several asyncronous calls for content over HTTP. Each time this content is received, it asks for the next bit and so on. These are all daiseychained in a big overall sync job with data on the server.p  pThere are probably 12 steps in this job chain. It seems to get stuck after around the 5th async request, the request never comes back and it hangs for ever waiting for it. I think it may have to do with too many threads being spawned because if I fire off the one it hangs at at the beginning it returns fine.p  pIn the way I imagine it in my head, the main thread asks for async content a. When it comes back in its own asynchronous time it spawns a new thread which then asks for aync content b. When it comes back in its own sweet time it spawns a new thread which then asks for content c. Isnt a new thread being created everytime an async request returns a resultp  pAm I daisychaining these requests right I was quite good at threads in Java development but Im a bit confused on how they work in ObjC. Do I need to use a Thread pool of say 3 threads and reuse thesep  pSorry for the highlevel question but Im sure some experts can help clear the cloud of mystery around this.p

Negative 352 pThis is a long one. I have a function that loads some image data from disk. Ive tried this with three different methods, one of which doesnt work, and Im wondering what the smartest method is.p  pMethod 1p  pI used to have it set up so that the loaded data was an argument to the function, which seemed to require allocating the space for it outside the function then passing a pointer to the allocated space. This requires knowing the size of the image ahead of time, so a helper function had to be made to get the image width and height first. The following is an example. p  pPros More explicit in the calling code that memory is being allocated and therefore should be deleted. p  pCons Need to know image size ahead of time.p  precode Data allocated outside the image, allocated space passed to function. This works.  Notice that width amp height are passed to the function.  sizewidthheight image   new unsigned char[size]  void readpgmunsigned char image, char filename, int width, int height       Code to read sizeofcharwidthheight bytes of data from the file into image   codepre  pMethod 2p  pI thought it would be nice to have the function allocate its own data so I dont need to pass it a size. If I tried to allocate the space for it in the function, it seemed to be lost after the function ended. In the following case, the function codereadpgmcode runs fine, but if I then try to write that data to another file, my code crashes.p  pPros Dont need to know image size ahead of time, no need to allocate data in calling code.p  pCons Doesnt work. Also, if it did, would calling it repeatedly in a loop result in a memory leak if I wasnt clearing image outside the functionp  precode Data allocated inside the image for a pointer passed to the function. This doesnt work. void readpgmunsigned char image, char filename, int width, int height      sizewidthheight     image   new unsigned char[size]       Code to read the data from the file into image   codepre  pMethod 3 p  pHere, the data is again allocated in the function but is handed back as a returned item. This works, i.e. I can then write the data out to another image fine. I dont understand why this works and Method 2 does not. p  pPros Same as Method 2.p  pCons Same as Method 2 except this currently works. p  precode Data allocated in the function, and returned. This works. unsigned char readpgmchar filename, int width, int height       Allocate data for the image     sizewidthheight     image   new unsigned char[size]       Code to read the data from the file into image      return image  Return pointer to the data  codepre  pSo, my questions arep  ol lipIn a case like this, is it smarter to set the function up to allocate space itself so the calling code doesnt need to supply the image size Or is it smarter to allocate outside the function as a reminder that delete needs to be called on image at some point. Or am I wrong in thinking that this needs to be done It seems like calling Method 2 or Method 3 in a loop would make a memory leak. pli lipWhy doesnt Method 2 workpli ol  pThanks. p

Negative 352 pI was searching for a solution of the following problem, so far without success Im planning a RESTful web service, where certain actions e.g. DELETE should require a special authentication.p  pThe idea is, that users have a normal usernamepassword login session based or Basic Auth, doesnt really matter here using which they can access the service. Some actions require an additional authentication in form of a PIN code or maybe even a onetime password. Including the extra piece of authentication into the login process is not possible and would miss the point of the whole exercise.p  pI thought about special headers something like XOTPAuthetication but that would make it impossible to access the service via a standard HTML page no means to include a custom header into a link. Another option was HTTP query parameters, but that seems to be discouraged, especially for DELETE.p  pAny ideas how to tackle this problemp

Negative 352 pA few weeks ago, I figured out how to write my own DisplayTemplates and EditorTemplates. I do find them useful as I can write something as this codeHtml.DisplayForModelmyawesometemplatecode which will display whatever is in the myawesometemplate and use the current Model in the View. Fantastic rightp  pWell, I have written my views in so many different ways, that now I am ending right back to way I first wrote them Just straight in the View with no partials or templates, and using ViewModels. Why Because I lack ultimate flexibility and lose consistency. For example If I had in my DisplayTemplate, codeModel.HamSandwhichTextcode, since this is in my template, I can only move it around inside my template and not in the actual View. Technically I could use it directly in the View, but at that point I just broke consistency. This means that the View and the Template both have access to the same thing. I dont like this. Im assuming since I am using ViewModels I will not have to worry so much about templates.p  pBut, what is the real reason to use a template I do notice it makes displaying lists a little bit cleaner and easier but I still dont like it.p

Negative 352 pIm a CS student and for our final we were told to construct the reflections on multiple spheres via ray tracing. Thats almost literally what we got for directions except a picture for how it should look when finished. So I need spheres, with theyre reflections using ray tracing mapped on them with the proper shading from a light.p  pWell I have all of it working, except having multiple spheres and the fact that it doesnt look like the picture he gave us for a rubric. p  pThe multiple spheres thing Im not too sure how to do, but Id say I need to store them in a 2D array and modify a few sections of code. p  pWhat I thought was modifying the sphereintersect and findreflect to include which sphere is being analyzed. Next, modify findreflect so that when the new vector u is calculated its starting point P0 is also updated. Then if the ray hits a sphere it will have to count how many times the ray has been reflected. At some point terminate after 10 times maybe and then Ill just draw the pixel. For an added touch Id like to add solid colors to the spheres which would call for finding the normal of a sphere I believe.p  pAnyways Im going to attach a picture of his, a picture of mine, and the source code. Hopefully someone can help me out on this one. p  pThanks in advancep  pProfessors spheres p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6EJfA.jpg altenter image description herep  pMy spheres p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comusbNb.jpg altenter image description herep  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltGLglut.hgt include ltmath.hgt include ltstringgt  define screenwidth 750 define screenheight 750 define true 1 define false 0 define perpendicular 0  int gridXsize  20 int gridZsize  20 float plane[]  0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 50.0, float sphere[]  250.0, 270.0, 100.0, 100.0 float eye[]  0.0, 400.0, 550.0 float light[]  250.0, 550.0, 200.0  float dotfloat u, float v     return u[0]v[0]  u[1]v[1]  u[2]v[2]   void normfloat u     float norm  sqrtabsdotu,u     for int i 0 i lt3 i           u[i]  u[i]norm        float planeintersectfloat u, float pO     float normt[3]  plane[0], plane[1], plane[2]     float s     if dotu,normt  0           s  10         else           s  plane[3]dotpO,normtdotu,normt         return s   float sphereintersectfloat u, float pO      float deltaP[3]  sphere[0]pO[0],sphere[1]pO[1],sphere[2]pO[2]    float deltLen  sqrtabsdotdeltaP,deltaP    float t0    float answer    float det     if det absdotu,deltaPdotu,deltaP deltLendeltLensphere[3]sphere[3] lt 0           answer  10         else           t 1dotu,deltaP sqrtdet             if tgt0                 answer  t               else                 answer  10                return answer   void findreflectfloat u, float s, float pO     float n[3]  pO[0]s u[0]sphere[0],pO[1]s u[1]sphere[1],pO[2]s u[2] sphere[2]    float l[3]  s u[0],s u[1],s u[2]    u[0] 2dotl,nn[0]l[0]    u[1]  2dotl,nn[1]l[1]    u[2]  2dotl,nn[2]l[2]   float findshadefloat u,float s, float pO     float answer    float lightVec[3]  light[0]pO[0]s u[0], light[1]pO[1]s u[1], light[2]pO[2]s u[2]    float n[3]  pO[0]s u[0]sphere[0],pO[1]s u[1]sphere[1],pO[2]s u[2]sphere[2]    answer  1dotlightVec,nsqrtabsdotlightVec,lightVecsqrtabsdotn,n    return answer   void init     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION    glLoadIdentity    gluOrtho2D0,screenwidth,0,screenheight   void display     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT    glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW    glLoadIdentity     for int i0 i lt screenwidth i           for int j0 j lt screenheight j                 float ray[3]  1eye[0]i,1eye[1]j,1eye[2]          float point[3]  i,j,0          normray          int plotted  false           while plotted                       float splane  planeintersectray, point             float ssphere  sphereintersectray, point              if splane lt 0 ampamp ssphere lt0                             glColor3f0,0,0                glBeginGLPOINTS                glVertex3fi,j,0                glEnd                plotted  true                           else if ssphere gt 0  ampamp splane lt0  ssphere lt splane                             findreflectray, ssphere, point                           else if splane gt0 ampamp ssphere lt0 splane lt ssphere                             float shade  findshaderay, splane, point                float xx  splaneray[0]  eye[0]                float z  splaneray[2]  eye[2]                 if absintxxgridXsize2  absintzgridZsize2                                   glColor3fshade,0,0                                 else                                   glColor3fshade,shade,shade                                 glBeginGLPOINTS                glVertex3fi,j,0                glEnd                plotted  true                                       glFlush   int mainint argc, char argv     glutInitampargc, argv    glutCreateWindowRay Trace with Sphere.    glutInitWindowSizescreenwidth,screenheight    glutInitDisplayModeGLUTSINGLEGLUTRGB    glutDisplayFuncdisplay    init    glutMainLoop    return 0  codepre

Negative 352 pGot here something really strange... The case is rather complex, so take a seat and have a beer before starting.p  pMy application runs on IceFaces 2.0.2 and JBoss 7.0.2.Final, apparently the JSF API version is 2.1 and EL API 2.2. However, I dont think IceFaces knowledge is required to understand the following. I suspect that the error is due to lifecycle in JSF2, especially in the order of rendering of the JSF objects.p  pThe concept is to have application tabs, but handled by JSF and not by the browser due to the serverside storage of the view, multiple browser tabs brings tons of problems because of the unique session.p  pConsequently, I do have a TabsBean class that do contains a List of Tab. A Tab has simply 3 fields  an included XHTML file named target, a title for the tab named label and an object to print or edit named object, and a few functions like getIndex to find the index of the object in the TabsBean, close function, ... The TabsBean provides the functions to add a tab or to close a tab with a specific index in the list. It also keeps track of the currently selected tab which index is registered as selectedTab. These two classes Tab and TabsBean are about 350 lines of code, so I wont give it completely here.p  pHere is now the piece of code that do print the tabs p  precodeltuirepeat vartab valuetabsBean.tabsgt    ltli classtabtabsBean.selectedTab eq tab.index   selected  gt       lticecommandLink valuetab.label  actionListenertab.selectTab gt       lticecommandLink actionListenertab.closeTabgt          ltimg src..resourcesimagesiconsclose.gif altx gt       lticecommandLinkgt    ltligt ltuirepeatgt codepre  pHere is the piece of code that do include the right XHTML p  precodeltuiinclude srctabsBean.tabs[tabsBean.selectedTab].target gt codepre  pUp to here, still quite simple.

But when I call the code.keycode method on that entity, I get things like codedatastoretypes.Key.frompathuModel, 1L, apputestbedtestcode, while codeModelcode is clearly not the correct kind of my entity.p  pWhen I try to get the entity for that key codedatastoretypes.Key.frompathuModel, 1L, apputestbedtestcode, it works just fine.p  pThe problem is, when I only know the codeidcode of a datastore entity, and I try to construct the key manually, using codedb.Key.frompath...code.p  pFor example, the kind should be codeUsercode, so I can construct the key using codedb.Key.frompathUser, 1code. But I cannot get an entity from the datastore using that key. I can, however, using codedb.Key.frompathModel, 1code, but, as I said, codeModelcode is not the correct datastore kind.p  pIn other wordsp  precodefrom myapp.models import User Useremaildontwrite.us.kind   returns Model, not User codepre  pNote that this unexpected behaviour does not occur in production or in the dev server, only when using codetestbedcode, and only when the codedb.Modelcode subclass is defined in my application code i.e. not in the test cases themselves.p  pI am not using Django, Im using Pyramid with traversal, but the unit tests Im running here do not call any frameworkspecific code.p  pNote that strikeI havent tried this with codendbcode yetstrike the same thing happens with codendbcode as well..p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pApparently I havent noticed that all of my classes were subclasses of a codegoogle.appengine.ext.db.polymodel.PolyModelcode subclass, so the keys were in fact correctly set as codeModelcode, because the kind is codeModelcode on all codePolyModelcode subclasses.p

I am still not sure what the right scenario is to use one, because I know myself and I tend to use technologies although they may be an overhead for needs.p  pSo my question is What are some good reasonsscenarios to use a Servicebus and do I need to use DDD technics to use itp  pSome scenarios I thought ofp  ul liCommunication with external systems e.g. my application is communicating with external systems and I want to make sure these get called, e.g. I persist an object within my database but I also have to call an external Webservice to synchronize data. I would create a Command and I would have 2 Handlers that get the event, one persisting to my database, the other one handling the webservice. If on command fails it will be retriedli liScalability I would be able to scale out on multiple machinesli liIt may lead to cleaner code instead of performing several sequential tasks when e.g. an Entity is updated I oculd have different Messagehandlers that perform these tasks in isolation, e.g. save the entity, another Handler could perform an update on a denormalized datastore etc.li ul

Negative 352 pThis question is referring to the Modules in C proposals floating around, and more broadly to C like languages that need a similar feature like my toy language Im currently... toying with. In my world, header files do not exist, forward declarations would be a pest to maintain when writing any kind of code, and a single module can consist of several source files.p  pThe problem is as followsp  blockquote   pSource file A uses a function or class from source file B, in the same module currently being compiled.p blockquote  pWhy is this a problemp  ul liThere is no module file for the things contained in file B, it will be generated when all source files are compiled.li liI do not want to compile file B twice, nor force all files in a module to be compiled at the same time. This is to keep the eventual build simple and easy.li liI do not want the user to be forced to compile file B first. Im not saying cyclic dependencies should be allowed, I just want to be able to compile both files in parallel. Heck, automatic determination of the necessary compile order would imply compiling files more than once, which is something Id like to avoid at all costs.li ul  pAny thoughts and of course solutions are very welcomep

Negative 352 pOur DBA requires us to return all tabular data from stored procedures in a set of associative arrays rather than using a ref cursor which is what I see in most examples on the web.  He says this is because it is much faster for Oracle to do things this way, but it seems counter intuitive to me because the data needs to be looped over twice, once in the stored procedure and then again in the application when it is processes.  Also, values often need to be casted from their native types to varchar so they can be stored in the array and then casted back on the application side.  Using this method also makes it difficult to use orm tools because they seem to want ref cursors in most cases.p  pAn example of a stored procedure is the followingp  precodePROCEDURE sampleprocedure                                  pOne       OUT varchararraytype,                                 pTwo       OUT varchararraytype,                                 pThree     OUT varchararraytype,                                 pFour      OUT varchararraytype                              IS ptitleprocedurename        VARCHAR2100  sampleprocedure vstarttime DATE SYSDATE      CURSOR cur   IS     SELECT e.one, e.two, e.three, e.four FROM package.table      WHERE filtersomething      vcounter PLSINTEGER  0 BEGIN      FOR rec IN cur LOOP         BEGIN             vcounter  vcounter  1             pOnevcounter  rec.one             pTwovcounter  rec.two             pThreevcounter  rec.three             pFourvcounter  rec.four         END     END LOOP END codepre  pThe cursor is used to populate one array for each column returned.  I have tried to find information supporting his claim that this is method faster but have been unable to do so.  Can anyone fill me in on why he might want us the .net developers to write stored procedures in this wayp

Negative 352 pI was told a while back about the LMAX disruptor and how performant it is compared with standard message queues. I downloaded the latest version and see that its an ordinary JAR that contains lots of classes and types that all revolve around its ultrafast RingerBuffer object.p  pUltimately speaking, at the end of the day, a queuebased JMS provider is just going to boil down to a lot of code managing a Java queue object or, more likely a concurrent queue. So in this respect, I see the comparison between the LMAX Disruptor and a JMS provider or rather, its internal queue.p  pBut a JMS provider is so much more than a few queues. Its an entire middleware application for handling messaging tofrom consumers and producers. Im wondering if there is a JMS provider equivalent in LMAX landp  pIt would be nice to connect to a Disruptor Broker in a similar manner as any other JMS broker, and readwrite messages tofrom it.p  pDoes anything like this exist, or am I way offbase herep

So when field2 has Employee selected the field3 label says City you work in, but when field2 has Retiree selected then field3s label should be City where you live.p  pOne solution I have done is to have multiple  tags inside of the field3 label, and then using some JavaScript I can toggle which of the  tags inside the label is being displayed, like thisp  precode Form as above ltlabel forfield3gt     ltspan idfield3EmployeeLabel styledisplaynonegtCity you work inltspangt     ltspan idfield3RetireeLabel styledisplaynonegtCity where you liveltspangt ltlabelgt ltinput idfield3 namefield3 typetext gt  function updateLabel      iffield2.valEmployee          field3RetireeLabel.hide         field3EmployeeLabel.show           else iffield2.valRetiree          field3EmployeeLabel.hide         field3RetireeLabel.show          else          field3RetireeLabel.hide         field3EmployeeLabel.show              codepre  pThe main reason that I dont like this is that it all has to be coded by hand, and this is just a simple example, what if there are 7 or 8 different options in field2  Also, what if I had to combine multiple form field values to figure out which label to displayp  pIs there a design pattern or bestpractice for this sort of thing in HTML  How have others handled this sort of requirement on their formsp

Negative 352 pIm looking into using JSR303 with hibernate validator.  We would like to be able to have different validations per each customer or have a base set of constraints and allow them to be overridden.p  pIm not sure whats the best way to do this.p  pUsing annotations for constraints is not suitable since theyre essentially hardcoded in the models.  I know I can use XML to externalize the validations creating METAINFvalidation.xml which specifies constraintmapping files.  But Im not really sure how to easily make this configurable for multiple customers.p  pI suppose I would like to be able to set a simple property so that when we deploy it uses a completely different set of constraintmapping files.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 352 pI have an app that when loads, loads a tab based app whereby all tabs work fine. In the first tab however the view loaded has a whole bunch of buttons. I have written methods of these buttons so when pressed they push a new subview .xib and this works fine. p  pHowever, when in these new subviews I have a back button which has its own method. I want this button to remove the view and return back to the orignal view. Here is the code from FirstViewController.m.p  pBear in mind that this File holds all the code even though it handles different .xib files. basically it pushes FirstView first, then when button is pressed it will push codeE87view.xibcode, the code for the .xib is still within the firstviewcontroller file.p  precodeIBAction backButtonPressed      [self showAll]     backButton.hidden  1      for UIView subview in [self.view subviews]          [subview removeFromSuperview]          [self showAll]   IBAction E87Pressed      [self hideAll]      E87view e87view  [[E87view alloc] initWithNibNameE87view bundle[NSBundle mainBundle]]      [self.navigationController pushViewControllere87view animatedYES]     [self.view addSubviewe87view.view]  codepre  pSo just to reiterate, when i press the button E87 on the first view thats loaded codeFirstView.xibcode it will push the new view codeE87view.xibcode. However when I press the back button on this newly loaded codeE87viewcode it will access the above function and remove the view but also remove all the setup I had from codeFirstView.xibcode essentially leaving me with an empty app. p  pHope this makes sense I can ramble a bit.p  pRegards,p  pLewisp
Negative 352 pgcc provides the codeIcode option, for which codeIcode directories preceding the codeIcode are searched for quoted includes codeinclude foo.hcode, and codeIcode directories following the codeIcode are searched for bracketed includes codeinclude ltfoo.hgtcode, as well as after the others for quoted includes.p  pcodeIcode has another very important effect.  It removes the directory of the source file that the codeincludecode is in from the default search path.  Normally a quoted include always searches the directory of the source file, and searches it embeforeem any codeIcode or other directories.  codeIcode therefore allows you to specify exactly where to go for quoted include files in the order you want, by removing that default path that otherwise would take priority.p  pSo it sounds like I answered my question, yes  No.  When I use codeIcode now, I get this nastygramp  precodecc1 note obsolete option I used, please use iquote instead codepre  pThe problem is that codeiquotecode does emnotem remove the current directory from the search path.  It is still always searched first, no matter what I provide to codeiquotecode.p  pSo the question is how do I get the same effect as codeIcode, without using codeIcode, which has been deprecated and will eventually go awayp  pstrongElaborationstrongp  pSuppose files are laid out as followsp  precodesrcdir     configure     file1.c     file2.c     config.h  builddir     Makefile     file1.o     file2.o     config.h     libpudding.a codepre  pFor various reasons, we cant remove codeconfig.hcode from codesrcdircode it will impact the build process on other platforms.  However, we want to include the codeconfig.hcode from codebuilddircode in preference to the codezconf.hcode in codesrcdircode.p  pThis can be accomplished with GCCs codeIcode flag, but it seems otherwise impossible.p  pstrongUpdated questionstrongp  pOk, it seems like the GNU CC developers deprecated codeIcode, but did not provide an alternative way to achieve its functionality.  So my updated question is what is the most effective way to bring this to the attention of the developers so that there is a high probability that either codeIcode is undeprecated which I would find most preferable, since it is a quite elegant way to handle specifying the search, much more so and much less ugly than iquotexxx, or that some way is provided to remove the current directory from a quoted include search pathp

When     direct is False, fieldobject is the corresponding RelatedObject     for this field since the field doesnt have an instance associated     with it.      Uses a cache internally, so after the first access, this is very fast.      codepre

Negative 352 pHeres what were trying to dop  pWe want an unobtrusive way of taking everything a client prints on their computer all of our clients are running POS systems and use Windows XP exclusively and sending it to us, and weve decided the best way to do that is to create a c app that sends us their spool files, which we can already parse easily. p  pHowever, this requires setting Keep All Printed Documents to true. We want to do this in our app rather than manually, for the following reason some hundreds of our clients are, for lack of a better word, dumb.

Negative 352 pIve a problem laying out an ecommerce page with very strict layout requirements.  We want to show a product image alongside a product description, with some optional extra information about the product below the image.  The width is constrained by our overall page layout, while height can be variable.  The answer seems to be you cant do this with pure CSS.p  pHeres a mock up img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJlS9X.png altDesign mock upp  pThe marked widths are 37212178562 leaving 8px in borders.  The image and description areas have 2px borders, making a total of 8px horizontal pixels, and 5628570.p  pIve got the vertical centering of the image mostly sorted, what breaks the design is the optional extra info panel.  The site is generated by PHP, which optionally includes the codeltdivgtcode for that extra info if the data is available for the product.  Id be happy to always include the extra info element and style it to be invisible if its empty, if it helps solve the design problem.p  pRequirementsp  ul liProduct image can be any aspect ratio.  Some are thin and tall, some wide and short, some square.li liProduct image should fill its area horizontally and naturally size itself vertically by its aspect ratio.li liProduct image should be vertically centered in its area blue.  When extra info is not visible, image would be vertically centered alongside the Description area.  When extra info is visible, image should be vertically centered in the remaining space.li liExtra info can be any amount of text and aligned to bottom of product image area.  So, cannot have fixed height.li liProduct Description can be any amount of text.li liThe image and extra info column should vertically match the size of the description column and vice versa.li liDescription and Extra Info boxes employ CSS gradient backgrounds and borders.  All these divs must actually size themselves accordingly, I cannot get away with faux columns as described here a hrefhttpwww.alistapart.comarticlesfauxcolumns relnofollowhttpwww.alistapart.comarticlesfauxcolumnsa.li liDo not want to use Javascript to align elements.  Yes, Im sure were all jQuery masters and its a wonderful tool, but it shouldnt be required for this layout.li ul  pMy design so far employs pure CSS and no tables, using the tablecell style to center the image, but there is some fudgery to do with minheight that breaks when different size images are used.

However, extremely helpful as they were, the discussion was too complex to continue on IRC.  I understand that codelttablegtcode brings with it all sorts of horrible layout mechanics that is simply broken for accurate page layout, however, I cant think of a better solution, mostly because of my requirement to keep the columns the same height.p  pWould appreciate constructive criticism, alternative solutions, or even just confirmation of my plight p  pstrongEDITstrong  here is the HTML and CSS content from the jsfiddle given above, for those who prefer this content contained within the stackoverflow question.

Something tells me that this is a poor design choice on my part in terms of code clarity, and I can already feel it starting to shoot me in the foot even at this early stage. p  pb Questions p  pa Am I using the correct datatype for such a project Is my approach correctbr   b Should I just give up on trying to make this code feel clean p  pb As I am kinda coding this by touch and go, I would appreciate some insightsp  pP.S I realise that this problem is quite suited for C, but F is more fun additionally verification of the dissector later on sounds appealingp

Negative 352 pGiven a map codea 1 b [2,3]code, is there a builtin function which would return the sequence codea 1 b [2,3]code.p  pThe use case is applying an options map to a function which does mapdestructured binding on the remainder of an argument list. a hrefhttpsgithub.comclojurecore.cacheblob10cc84973a7b97ada8fb56e9859ce101a477bde5srcmainclojureclojurecorecache.cljL545564 relnofollowHeres an example of this in core.cachea. Heres a contrived example to illustratep  precodedefn makecar [amp as options] assoc options car true makecar color red speed fast  gt car true, speed fast, color red codepre  pNow if we want to manage the options separately and codeapplycode them to the function, we have a problemp  precodedef options color red speed fast apply makecar options  gt car true, [speed fast] [color red] codepre  p...because of course the codeseqcode of a map is a sequence of its keyvalue pairs.

I know I could just make my own function to do this, but Im surprised I havent found something builtin.

Negative 352 pI am trying to make a very simple window manager for learning purposes. I am using codeCcode and the codexcbcode library. I am trying to get an event raised if a new application is launched.p  pFor now, I create a root window where I can receive mouse and keyboard events. I also draw a colored bar on the top of the window. When I press enter, xterm will launch using fork and execvp. This all works great.p  pWhen xterm or any application I think launches, it gets drawn on top of the bar x  0, y  0. I would like to move it a bit lower x  0, y  16. I think I know how to move the window, using codexcbconfigurewindowcode. But I dont know how to get an event for the newly launched application.p  pstrongEditstrongbr After some messing around I came to the following conclusionsbr If I create my parent window like thisp  precodexcbwindowt windowroot  screengtroot uint32t mask  0     uint32t values[2] mask  XCBCWEVENTMASK values[0]  XCBEVENTMASKSUBSTRUCTURENOTIFY xcbchangewindowattributescheckedconnection, windowroot, mask, values xcbflushconnection codepre  pi will receive a XCBCREATENOTIFY when I spawn a new terminal. However, I am not able to draw anything on the screen, because I am not subscribed to the codeXCBEVENTMASKEXPOSEcode event. If I change the values[0] line to this  p  precodevalues[0]  XCBEVENTMASKSUBSTRUCTURENOTIFY  XCBEVENTMASKEXPOSURE codepre  pi will still receive creation events, but the expose event does not get called as soon as the program starts, so my bar will not get drawn. It will get an expose event as soon as I launch a new terminal though, but my initial drawing wont happen.p  pMy old method of creating a parent window was  p  precodexcbwindowt window  xcbgenerateidconnection uint32t mask  XCBCWBACKPIXEL  XCBCWEVENTMASK uint32t values[2]  screengtwhitepixel, XCBEVENTMASKEXPOSURE  XCBEVENTMASKSUBSTRUCTURENOTIFY  xcbcreatewindowconnection, 0, window, screengtroot, 0, 0, screengtwidthinpixels, screengtheightinpixels, 0, XCBWINDOWCLASSINPUTOUTPUT, screengtrootvisual, mask, values xcbmapwindowconnection, window codepre  pThis will draw a white background and draw my colored bar, because it immediately gets an XCBEVENTMASKEXPOSURE event. But it wont get an XCBCREATENOTIFY event.p  pSo what is the correct way to get both the XCBCREATENOTIFY events and the XCBEVENTMASKEXPOSURE eventsp

Negative 352 pOkay, let me preface this by saying that I am very new to OpenGL as it pertains to Android, and while Ive been reading up on it for some time, I cannot get past this roadblock in my coding.p  pCurrently I am trying to write a class to load textures from .png file located in my drawables folder onto a .obj model that I made in Blender. I did a UV unwrap on the Blender model, and then used the uv unwrap as a guide for the .png file. p  pThe issue currently is that I am able to load the texture onto the model, but it is one solid color which seems to be coming from the texture file. Clearly I dont understand enough about UV texturing in Blender, but there are so many different OpenGL libraries, and so much variation from PC to Android that its really hard to wrap my head around what works where.p  pI would be extremely grateful if somebody could help me with this.

Negative 352 pIm running Win7 64bit and Firebird 2.5.2.p  pIs it possible to access a 32bit Firebird database via ODBC from a 64bit C application  My initial thought was that I could just install the 64bit Firebird ODBC driver and it would work.  Sure enough, after installing it the 64bit ODBC control panel app shows the Firebird driver, but the connection fails when trying to point it to an .fdb file created with 32bit Firebird.

I must have accidentally mixed some 32 and 64bit pieces of the config when setting things up.  Once I ensured that I was 1 running the 64bit server, 2 using a 64bit ODBC data source which 3 referred to the 64bit client DLL from the 64bit Firebird install my 64bit C app connected with no issue.p  pI thought I checked those but I must have missed something in going between 32 and 64bit.p

Negative 352 pAs youve read on the title, I have a project on photo capture on mobile devices. I am supposed to detect if the realtime input to the camera of a mobile device is stable or not. But so far, all Ive been seeing is on stabilization itself, mostly videos...not on seeing whether the input is stable. And I havent read or seen any paper which has metrics on image instability. Though there are items on blur and focus, but they are not quite concrete. Is there any way on quantifying the instability of an image assuming its more than just blur, shake, and focusp

Negative 352 pI have a MDB that receives messages to process a batch BatchProcessor.  Instead of working on one item in the batch at a time, the BatchProcessor will create a BatchItemProcessor and using a Semaphore will allow a max number of items to be processed concurrently at a time.  The BatchItemProcessors are stateless session beans and injected by the Glassfish container.p  pWe need to send a SOAP message to another service whenever we finish processing a batch item with its status.  The BatchItemProcessor createssends a message to a JMS topic.  We have another MDB, StatusSender, which listens for this messages and createssends the SOAP messge to the other service.p  pThe problem is that the SOAP messages arent being sent until all the batch items have been dispatched by the BatchProcessor.p  pLooking at the logs, the BatchItemProcessors are being created in an EJB thread pool e.g. name from logs codeejbthreadpool10code and the BatchProccessor and StatusSender are created in, what I am assuming is, the Glassfish MDB thread pool e.g. name from log codep threadpool1 w 39code.p  pI am assuming because I cant find documentation to confirmdeny that codep threadpool1code identifies the pool and codew 39code the actual thread.  If this is true, then the BatchProcessor uses a completely different thread than the StatusSender since the thread identifiers are different one for BatchProcess and multiple ones for StatusSender.p  pWhich means Im really confused as to why the BatchProcessor onMessage must complete before the StatusSender onMessage calls can be executed.p  pLooking at my Glassfish EJB ContainerMDB Settings configuration both defaultconfig and serverconfig I have the following which I believe are defaultsp  ul liInitial and Min Pool Size  0li liMax Pool Size  32li liPool Resize Quantity  8li liIdle Timeout  600li ul  pIf someone call help me with this issue it would be very appreciated.  Also, any recommondations for a good resource book, website, etc. would also be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pMy issue was related to some code logic which was causing the delay of StatusSender onMessage being executed.  However, I would still appreciate any recommendation for a good reference on Glassfish and threadspools.p

Negative 352 pIve written a small COM Server in Delphi 2010 that acts as a plugin into a retail application. The retail application looks for a discover interface which registers any number of additional interfaces calling codeTAutoObjectFactory.Createcode for each one. This is working just fineall the plugin interfaces function as designed.p  pBut now Id like to call a public method of one interface from another interface so I dont have to duplicate code. Seems simple enough, just call codeComClassManager.ForEachFactorycode looking for the ClassID of the interface I need to use.  Got that working, toop  pBut now that I found the class, Im stumped by a seemingly trivial final step how to use or cast the class or class reference Ive located to actually call one of its methods.p  pIn the FactoryProc Ive sent to codeForEachFactorycode, I assume the ComClass property of codeTComObjectFactorycode is what Im after, but its of type TClass, a class reference to the actual class object to which it points at least I hope Im understanding this correctly.

Negative 352 pApologies if this is overbroad. p  pI am a project manager and have recently had a founding developer become incapacitated, the project was one that they had been developing on their own. p  pWe are now left in a position whereby the code is undocumented and no support documentation has been kept after almost 12 months in development  a lesson we have learned the hard way. We are obviously looking for a replacement developer now however we have never been put in such a situation before and would like any advice people may have on reverse engineering and breaking down the project.p  pThe project was a web app,it was coded in Scala and utilised mongoDB. There is not currently any unittesting we were in the process of implementing this at the time  The app was fairly far along in development and it is absolutely critical we get it running as soon as possible. Rewriting the code is not something we would consider at this point. Scala had been learned by the developer exclusively for the project and we do not have other developers who know the language. p  pHow feasible is reverse engineering code Even with a talented new developer is it likely that we will be able to completely reverse engineer the app Does reverse engineering take considerably longer than the original coding p  pBasically we would like any advice people can offer on how to best approach getting the project back online. We would also like to provide any new developer with as much info about the project as possible.p  pThanks in advance.p

These libraries are built into .so files via the traditional cmake . then make all process. After the .so files are generated from cmake, I copy the .so files into a subdirectory of my project so that I can test that they are working before I install them into usrlib. Then I provide Qt in my .pro file with a absolute path to each library and build my application. My application finds these local libraries and compiles without errors or warnings. However, when I run my application via command line I receive the following errorp  precode    error while loading shared libraries libslugSpec.so wrong ELF class ELFCLASS64 codepre  pHowever, when I build the slug libraries on a 64 bit environment and link to them in a 64 bit environment my application runs perfectly. So, I figured I built the .so files for a 64 bit environment,and proceeded to edit the CMakeLists.txt file used to build the libraries. I add numerous 32 bit compilation and linking flags, shared object module flags, in addition to cuda which slug relies on bitness flags . No matter what combination of flags I tried, the libraries generated kept causing the error when running my application executable. So I decided to run the strongreadelf hstrong command on each shared object file and check to see if they were really 64 bit. I found out that none of them are in fact, all producing logs similar to the following output for one of 3 .so filesp  precodereadelf h libslugSpec.so  ELF Header Magic   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  Class                             ELF32 Data                              2s complement, little endian Version                           1 current OSABI                            UNIX  System V ABI Version                       0 Type                              DYN Shared object file Machine                           Intel 80386 Version                           0x1 Entry point address               0x10150 Start of program headers          52 bytes into file Start of section headers          511960 bytes into file Flags                             0x0 Size of this header               52 bytes Size of program headers           32 bytes Number of program headers         7 Size of section headers           40 bytes Number of section headers         38 Section header string table index 35 codepre  pSo now I am completely at a loss and cant seem to find an answer anywhere.

Negative 352 pIn my website I have a form which contains more than one file input fields. The first one isp  precodeltinput typefile namequestionimages[] multiple gt codepre  pI use this one to upload multiple images. The next ones arep  precodeltinput typefile nameoptionimages1 gt ltinput typefile nameoptionimages2 gt ltinput typefile nameoptionimages3 gt ... ltinput typefile nameoptionimagesn gt codepre  pThe number of these input fields varies depending on user input. All except the first input fields are inserted dynamically by the user, I basically use jquery and use the codehtmlcode method to insert a new input field every time the user clicks a button, and the name of the input fields changes by adding and incrementally bigger value at the end of the name of the input filed, so I can distinguish it from the rest.p  pI am using the Jquery form plugin to upload the images through ajax using the codeajaxSubmitcode function.p  pThe problem is, when the user clicks the respective button to insert a new input, that new input filed has the name attribute equal to codequestionimages[]code which is the name of the first input field, which is always there regardless of the user input. Even though I write something likep  precodesomeID.htmlltinput typefile nameoptionimages1 gt codepre  pThe input field gets the name codequestionimages[]code instead of the name codeoptionimages1code. What is causing this Is the Jquery form plugin automatically overwriting the name values of the newly inserted input tagsp  pNOTE I want to add images from the dynamically added fields so I can distinguish them from the images uploaded through the first input field with PHP, that is why I dont use the first input field to upload all of the images. The first input field can add multiple images if it wants, but the ones added through the other input fields are images that I need for another purpose so I need to distinguish them from the images uploaded through the first input field.p

Negative 352 pA friend of mine as me this question and it struck me that I cannot find any possible definite solution to this, so I pass the question to the community of experts.p  pThe goal storing file  bytes securely so that only client code can decrypt the bytes and present it to the user.p  pLet me explain with an example. Imagine I am building a video player mobile app. Server sends the encrypted content to client client stores the encrypted content to device and when user wants to play the video, client code decrypts the encrypted bytes from device and render the video to user.p  pThe problem is that to decrypt, I will need a key, and since I need the client to be able to decrypt, the client needs to hold the key. Having an encryption key on the client side is always not secure.p  pCommon proposed solutions I have been reading is to tie the encryption key to users login credentials which does not work in my case because I am not protecting users data, but protecting data from anyone including the users themselves.p  pMy take is that it is not possible to protect data perfectly. The possible is to make it hard for anyone to decrypt my data, but come to think of it, if at least one user can do it, the video will be distributed world wide and I might have to be responsible for that when you deal with copyright, consequences are damning. Please advise.p

For the first obvious solution, I chose to create an association entity for each of the relationships. We thought maybe there would be a better solution, though.p  pAfter extensive research and looking around for a solution, I found the concept of the second schema, which is to have a single voting table with a column Entity to define the type of the table or the table in which the ID EntityID being the ID of the Table it Came From belongs to. The only problem is that there is no relationship between the voting table and the three entities. Is there a way for the strongEntitystrong Column to refer to the table rather than the tables IDp  pAny suggestions of other constructive ways of developing the schema are welcome.p

Negative 352 pI am trying to strip the symbols so that we can distribute our code to external developers without disclosing our functionality. We are in the process of hiding our symbols so that when we issue nm command, the symbols shud not be visible.

But i am unable to get it for a static library. I tried following the below link but was unsuccessful,p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3276474symbolhidinginstaticlibrariesbuiltwithxcodegccSymbol hiding in static libraries built with Xcodegccap  pI have two files file1.c and file2.c and file1.c makes a function call to file2.c.

I have tried using the strongattributestrongvisibilityhidden before the function which I want to hide.

What makes the bean lose its state Or is there any other way to make use of ViewScopedp  pstrongmain.xhtmlstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN                   httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml  xmlnsfhttpjava.sun.comjsfcore xmlnschttpjava.sun.comjspjstlcore xmlnshhttpjava.sun.comjsfhtml xmlnsicehttpwww.icesoft.comicefacescomponent xmlnsuihttpjava.sun.comjsffacelets gt ltfview contentTypetexthtmlgt         lthheadgt         lthheadgt         lthbody idbodyId bgcolorwhitegt             lttable border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt                 lttrgt                     lttdgt                     lticepanelGroupgt                         lticeform idmainForm namemainFormgt                             lttablegt                                 lttbodygt                                     lttrgt                                         lttdgt                                             ltuiinclude srcmyTabs.xhtmlgt                                         lttdgt                                     lttrgt                                 lttbodygt                             lttablegt                         lticeformgt                     lticepanelGroupgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt             lttablegt         lthbodygt ltfviewgt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongmyTabs.xhtmlstrongp  precodeltfsubview  xmlnsfhttpjava.sun.comjsfcore xmlnshhttpjava.sun.comjsfhtml xmlnsicehttpwww.icesoft.comicefacescomponent xmlnsuihttpjava.sun.comjsffaceletsgt ltdivgt     lttable classicePnlTbSet idmyTabSet         border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt         lttbodygt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                 lttable cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt                     lttbodygt                         lttrgt                             lt My Tab 1 gt                             lttd classicePnlTb styleverticalalign bottom titletab1gt                             lttable cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt                                 lttbodygt                                     lttrgt                                         lttd classLftTopgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                         lttd classMidTopgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                         lttd classRtTopgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                     lttrgt                                     lttrgt                                         lttd classLftMidgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                         lttd classMidMidgt                                             lticecommandLink idmyLink valueMyTab 1 title                                                 actionListenermySessionBean.tabChangedgt                                                 ltfparam value0 nametab gt                                             lticecommandLinkgt                                         lttdgt                                         lttd classRtMidgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                     lttrgt                                     lttrgt                                         lttd classLftBtmgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                         lttd classMidBtmgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                         lttd classRtBtmgtltimg alt srcimagesspacer.gif                                              width4 height1 gtlttdgt                                     lttrgt                                 lttbodygt                             lttablegt                             lttdgt                             lt Repeat for n tabs gt                             lttrgt                         lttbodygt                     lttablegt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttbodygt     lttablegt ltdivgt ltuiinclude srctabcontent1.xhtml gt  ltfsubviewgt codepre  pstrongtabcontent1.xhtmlstrongp  precodeltfsubview  xmlnsfhttpjava.sun.comjsfcore xmlnshhttpjava.sun.comjsfhtml xmlnsicehttpwww.icesoft.comicefacescomponent xmlnsuihttpjava.sun.comjsffaceletsgt lticepanelGroupgt     lticedataTable  idempTable valuemyViewBean.empList             varempgt             ...     lticedataTablegt lticepanelGroupgt ltfsubviewgt codepre

Negative 352 pI am using MonoMacC and have an NSOutlineView where some of the items are editable. So if you select an item and then click it again slow double click the NSTextField of the row enter edit mode. My problem is that this happens even if you rightclick the item. You can even mix leftclicks and rightclicks to enter edit mode.p  pThis is pretty annoying since you would sometime select a row and then rightclick it, then a second after the context menu appears, the row enter edit mode.p  pIs there a way to restrict either the NSOutlineView or the NSTextFields inside it, to only enter edit mode using the left mouse button in addition to pressing Enter while the row is selectedp  pThanksp

Negative 352 pIm just starting to program Android Apps and Ive been coding along with a book that I got. The app is just suppose to run a bunch of test activists from a list activity. I test the list activity and it worked fine. I also tried to test the first activity on the activity list and it just gets stuck trying to load it and will just keep trying to load it. My code is practically verbatim from the book besides the package name. I know that it finds the class, its just the activity doesnt launch and I dont know why. I feel like Im just missing something simple or overlooking a small error. Here are the three file I have for the app so far.

Now that the codeUICollectionViewControllercode is embedded in a codeUIScrollViewcode, I want the scrollView to be the same size as its codecontentSizecode. p  pI made a subclass of codeUICollectionViewcode, implemented codeintrinsicContentSizecode method, and set the codeUICollectionViewcodes class to my custom class in IB. However codeintrinsicContentSizecode never gets called.

I tried adding a codeUIAttachmentBehaviorcode but couldnt figure out how to implement it correctly. I have seen the codeWWDCcode videos and other but I can not get it to work in this setting. If you could show me in this example how to implement it that would be great.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comppc6D.png altenter image description herep  precodeimplementation ViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.     mainView  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame[[self view] bounds]]     [mainView setBackgroundColor[UIColor clearColor]]     [[self view] addSubview mainView]      objectView        [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMakemainView.bounds.size.width240, 40,                                               80, 80]     [objectView setBackgroundColor[UIColor redColor]]     [mainView addSubview objectView]      barView        [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMakemainView.bounds.size.width250,                                                mainView.bounds.size.height5  4,                                                100, 3]     [barView setBackgroundColor[UIColor blackColor]]     [mainView addSubview barView]            animator  [[UIDynamicAnimator alloc] initWithReferenceViewmainView]      BounceCustomBehavior bouncyBehavior        [[BounceCustomBehavior alloc]                       initWithItems[objectView]                              objects[NSArray arrayWithObjectsbarView, nil]]     [animator addBehaviorbouncyBehavior]          codepre  hr  precodeimport BounceCustomBehavior.h  implementation BounceCustomBehavior instancetypeinitWithItemsNSArray items objectsNSArray collisionObjs      if self  [super init] return nil      UIGravityBehavior gravityBehavior  [[UIGravityBehavior alloc] initWithItemsitems]     [self addChildBehaviorgravityBehavior]      UICollisionBehavior collisionBehavior  [[UICollisionBehavior alloc] initWithItemsitems]     collisionBehavior.translatesReferenceBoundsIntoBoundary  YES      for UIView  view in collisionObjs          CGPoint rightEdge  CGPointMakeview.frame.origin.x                                          view.frame.size.width, view.frame.origin.y         [collisionBehavior addBoundaryWithIdentifier                                     fromPointview.frame.origin                                       toPointrightEdge]          [self addChildBehaviorcollisionBehavior]      UIDynamicItemBehavior elasticityBehavior  [[UIDynamicItemBehavior alloc] initWithItemsitems]     elasticityBehavior.elasticity  0.3f     [self addChildBehaviorelasticityBehavior]      return self  end codepre

Negative 352 pWe published a daily blog starting in 1998, almost before the word blog was invented. We had static pages set up in a folder structure, but yearmonthdateindex.shtml  content herep  pWe switched to Wordpress in November of 2008 and are now scraping the archives 19982008 and converting to JSON... with Title, Description, Category, Date and then we are using a PHP widget to read the JSON, convert to xml and upload using the WP RSS uploader. The problem is the RSS loader is very buggy and is failing. It keeps telling us posts are already in the database, even though the new posts have a unique date string and content string. the upload file is very small, only 3 MB, PHP has plenty of memory 120MB and upload file limit is set to 32MBp  pWe note that if one manually adds a record to the wpposts table from the back end, using something like PHPMyAdmin, it works fine. Since the RSS import is broken, we want to try to bulk upload old posts directly into the wppost table, but we need to add the category also. I think this is done in the wptermrelationships table where the objectid  the postid in the post table.p  pCan anyone add more light on this Are their more dependencies that need to be inserted into other tables We are only interested in the post, no comments or anything else. I would also need to know what the standard if for the GUID field.p  pIf this is a really bad idea, then given the RSS uploader in 3.6 is broken, what can we do  Is did see the CVS importer plug in and we may try that... but I wanted to know if we can do it directly in PHPMyAdmin or some other standard tool for importing directly into the database. We just need to make sure the category gets inserted.p

I would like it to retain its previous variables when being used for user convenience, for my convenience I have built the form into the default layout, to save recreating many instances of it.p  pdefault.blade.php Heres the form, with unnecessary markup removedp  precode Formopenarrayurl gt search   Formselectmodel, PhotogetAvailableModelstrue, model   Formselectcolour, PhotogetAvailableColourstrue, colour   FormsubmitGo   Formclose  codepre  pThe model amp colour are variables I am capturing during the post. The problem is, I am getting unset variable errors from Blade on any pages where the user hasnt posted to, so I am literally having to preset them in almost every route or controller across my entire site, just to prevent the errors.p  pIn essence, the system works fine as long as the user is posting, if someone visits the site using a direct link its basically useless.p  pObviously I can not have the search form be set to the previously searched results, but that would be bad practice from a usability point of view.p  pAm I missing something here, surely there has to be a simple solution to this. Thanks for any help.p

Negative 352 pI am currently working on a bidding system, and Im stuck on saving the winning bid numbers and amounts. This is cakePHP 2.4 by the way. When I go to submit a bid after editing the values it will depending on the solutions create a new record with no information, or just refresh and do nothing.

Negative 352 pIn my system, I would like users to create only one page for one book. And when there is the existing page already, I would like to show the link to the page.

Negative 352 pa hrefhttpwww.dcs.warwick.ac.ukhughTTMMissinginfowithoutnulls.pdf relnofollowSomea argue that codeNULLcodes in relational databases are evil and propose alternative approaches to missing information, usually leading to relations in 6NF. Then, essentially, missing information is being expressed by missing tuples in relations. However, in my understanding, that violates the Closed World Assumption, because if a tuple can possibly appear in some relation but doesnt, that means that the proposition corresponding to that tuple is false, emwhich is different from being unknownem.p  pFor example, consider following relationp  precode  NAME    AGE     andrey  30     codepre  pHere, the predicate is the person called codeNAMEcode is codeAGEcode years old, so we know that Andrey is 30 years old. If we do not know his age, then we could express that with a codeNULLcodep  precode  NAME    AGE     andrey  NULL   codepre  pHowever, if codeNULLcodes are prohibited, we could not do that. Instead, we could remove the tuple in the relation with codeNAMEcode andrey. But under the Closed World Assumption, that would imply that andrey does not have any age at all maybe he is eternal, which is different from saying that andrey emdoesem have some age, which we simply do not know.p  pSo, my question is is it really possible to model missing information correctly without codeNULLcodes and not violating the Closed World Assumption Or do I miss somethingp

Negative 352 pI am creating a shell that can execute commands from user input on the terminal. It also has a history feature. p  pEverything works fine right now.

However, when I run it, nothing executes when I type in those commands. p  pThe getrecentcommand and searchinlistforn functions are returning the correct command, but when I put the result of those functions in place of where args[0] should be in the execvp call, nothing happens. p  pNot sure.

Negative 352 pI think list comprehension is one of the most useful features of Python. I think it would be even more useful if Python allows the recursion inside list comprehension, for something like generation of Fibonacci numbers or prime numbers. I know that Python used to have codelocals[[1]]code for referencing the list thats being generated, but it has never been recommended and had been taken out.p  pSo, is there any reason that Python developers do not want users to use recursion in list comprehensionp

Negative 352 pstrongHi good folks on Stackoverflowstrongp  pIm curious if it is possible to create an event based schedule task by a specific resolved hostname in a private network. The task scheduler in Windows 7 seems to be pretty good, but I got lost in all the possibilities, especially the eventbasetrigger section. So heres my taskp  pIf a specific network connection via WLAN is established and a specific PC is online in my private network from which I want data, it should start a program which synchronices me two folders local and from the pc in network.p  pI actually dont want to program something new with java or something similiar if it is not absolutely necessary. The synchronising part is not the problem. Afters hours of searching on various sites on the internet I still dont have a clue how to do the PConlineinnetwork part. Is there a specific eventbasedtrigger I can use to look for a specific hostname Has someone any good suggestionsp

Negative 352 pI have a WinForms Application that was designed to support Full HD resolutions so 1920x1080. Now this App is also supposed to run on a lower resolution 1600x900.  Is there a way to let the application auto scale itself to fit the lower resolution Like you would just downscale an image, basically resizing and relocating each control.  My current forms and panels have set their size to 1900x1080, so they just extend out of the screen on the lower resolution. I have played around with AutoScaleModes and AutoSize, but the best I could get were Scrollbars so that you at least navigate through the forms. Is such a thing as downscaling an application even possible retaining dimensions relative sizes and positions of the controlsp  pThanks in advance for any inputs on thisp

Although, I sometimes have seg faults with this code. I read that codeCRYPTOcleanupallexdatacode  is not threadsafe but I need it because of memory leaks but I use it outside the parallel region, right When I remove codeopenmpcode calls everything works every time so there must be an issue with multithreading and codeopensslcode. Any ideas how to solve it p  pIn my opinion it should work, beacuse a threaded call of codecallfunwhichusesopensslcode creates its own private variables for every thread and there should be no problem ...

This function searches for a given value in the binary trees and it does that     by searching for level 1 in each binary trees, then moving on to level 2 if     it fails to find it that value in level 1 and so on.

Negative 352 pIn a typical js class, all calls to member functions must be preceded by codethiscode. I was looking at a technique that would let me create a library of interdependent STATIC functions and relying on closurescope to make things a bit easier.p  pExamplep  precodevar Singleton   main entry point    call with fn name, args...   callfunction     var args[]     if arguments.length0        return           get the fn name     var fnarguments[0]     var x      make args array     for x1xltarguments.lengthx        args[args.length]arguments[x]           I want to get rid of this part      See below for what I wish      Here I have access to fns below due to hoisting in js      so I put them in a map...     var fns       testtest        etc, more like this I do not want to typemaintain           ... all so I can do this      get my function.     var funfns[fn]      instead of that, I would like to override whitespace and      say something like      var fun[fnname]      so I can index into local scope and get a fn           log error if not found     if typeof funundefined        logeSingleton function not foundfn       return           ok, run the function     return fun.applywindow,args      the test fn accesses test2 without dot notation     function testa        Note here in test fn it can access test2         without using this.test2 syntax        as you would in normal objects       var stest2       alerts testa          function test2       return test2          codepre  pI was hoping someone more familiar with advances in javascript might have advice on how to emulate an implied but unnecessary codethiscode, it always struck me as strange that codethiscode defaults to window, and wouldnt it be nice if codethiscode could be pointed to an anonymous object with the local scope attached.p  pI would love to say code[localObject]code to get something in scope.p  h1Edith1  pAfter seeing some of the responses, I will restate this in the form of a challengep  pWhat I am looking for is a syntax cheat, a way to, as Varuna put it, 1. Access static methods without using this variable i.e. they will remain global to one another. 2. Do not want to maintain a local array for static methods and want to achieve with in the local scope itself.p  pPut differently, I need to have the declared functions Register themselves, but I dont want to state the function name more than once. I suppose Varuna has a solution using codeevalcode to access the local scope.p  pThe following approach wont workp  precodevar o o[fn]function fn o[fn2]function fn2 codepre  p...because you have to state the fn name twice, but closure is preserved.p  pAnd thisp  precodevar a[   function fn   ,function fn2 ] Registera codepre  pWill not work because, AFAIK, you lose closure, ie. fn2 cannot see fn. Which also makes the following declarative style a codethiscode nightmarep  precodewindow.MINE   fnfunction fn     this      want to say fn2, not this.fn2, nor MINE.fn2      ,fn2function fn2     this      ,deeper     more     codepre  pBut something like this might work, if you created a weird property that does the registration on assignmentp  precodevar registarnew Registar registar.regfunction fn registar.regfunction fn2 then access var fnregistar.getFnn  or var fnregistar.[n] codepre  pThe above relies on js properties and having access to fn.name, which is not available in all cases AFAIK.p
Negative 352 pWeve developed an irc bot in php which, among many other functions, will respond with the page title of any url a user sends to the channel.

Negative 352 pThere are some codevarbinarycode table columns in my database that i need to test for equality with a byte array, all happening through Entity Framework and LinqtoEntities. For LinqtoObjects, this is achieved very easily with the codeSequenceEqualscode extension method, however EF doesnt support it unfortunately, therefore i rely on the codecode operator which is correctly translated into a SQL query.p  pE.g.p  precodebyte[] deviceId  GetDeviceId  Device device  deviceRepository.QueryAll backed by a DbContext, returns IQueryableltDevicegt .Included gt d.RelatedEntity1 .Included gt d.RelatedEntity2 .Included gt d.RelatedEntityEtc .FirstOrDefaultd gt d.DeviceUniqueIdentifier  deviceId ampamp ...  LoginUserOnDevicedevice codepre  pThe problem is, though, when unit testing the piece of code involving the LinqtoEntities query, with a fake codedeviceRepositorycode, for whom i use an ordinary codeListltTgtcode transformed through an code.AsQueryablecode into an codeIQueryableltTgtcode, the equality operator is applied with its original semantics, i.e. reference equality, so the comparison obviously fails. Of course, this doesnt happen strictly for unit testing, but in any situation where the linq query is not executed anymore against a SQL data source.p  pWhat would be the optimal approach here Preferably without changing the query code, so it runs correctly both when querying against a real database using EF 6 and while unit testing. Materializing the entire collection into memory by calling code.ToListcode right after the codeIncludecodes or anything along these lines is out of the question in my scenario.p

Negative 352 pWhen I export my information to CSV file so its in raw data format and easily used in one of the fields I have a number that is big for example, 140313055811.  Its really just an invoice number, but when I export it to CSV and open it, it shows something like 1.41E11.  I need to get it to display the full number instead of this.  Is there a way I tried making the textbox that its in as a number, I tried make the value area of the field intname of field, I tried changing it to text.  None of these do the trick.p  pThe only one that has worked is FormatNumberfieldname and while this did work, it put commas in between as if it were a large number this is an invoice number.

Negative 352 pI found a most peculiar browser feature in the latest Chrome 35 WinAndroidiOS and Safari 7 iOS versions. If you have a math form with codeinput typenumbercode and enter a number with a decimal comma, the browsers do the calculations with the number as if the comma were a dot. And if you enter numbers with decimal dots, they do their normal calculations, but the resulting figure is displayed with a decimal comma. That is, in my European i.e. Dutch version. I dont know about American versions. p  pIf you would find that hard to believe, I made a demo to demonstrate it p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtDemo Browser Behavior w Number Inputslttitlegt     ltstylegt     input          boxsizing borderbox         margintop 10px         width 100px          ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform nametheFormgt         ltinput typenumber nameA1field min0 max100 step0.1gt Input field                 ltbrgt         ltinput typenumber nameA2field min0 max100 step0.1gt Input field                 ltbrgt         ltinput typebutton valueCalculate onclickcalculateAndPopulategt                 ltbrgt         ltinput typenumber nameR1field min0 max10000 step0.01gt Result field                 ltbrgt         ltinput typereset valueResetgt     ltformgt     ltscriptgt         function calculateAndPopulate              var A1val  theForm.A1field.value             var A2val  theForm.A2field.value             var R1  A1valA2val             theForm.R1field.value  R1              ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt  codepre  pLive demo here a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenxDvCBeditors100 relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpenxDvCBeditors100a.

Negative 352 pI am working on an Appengine Connected Android Project. I am using Google Eclipse Plugin. Anyway, after finishing my project and having it working for a few days, I decided to change the package names of the server code. But then when I generate the Cloud Endpoint Client Library, the new package name is not reflected on the client. I still see the old name there e.g. in codeendpointslibscode. Does anyone know how I might fix thisp  pBut something else also happens that is very interesting. The app works fine with the new server. When I run the android app and look at the log, it is calling the new server by the appropriate new name. So clearly the mapping between App Engine and Android is correct. So why is the name not updating in the client image my old package name was codecom.globs.gamecode and the new name is now codecom.pans.gamecode, if ever that helps.p

For NUMBER columns, ODP.NETs OracleDataReader will try a sequence of .NET types from Byte to Decimal to prevent overflow. But a NUMBER may still overflow Decimal, giving an invalid cast exception if you try any of the readers .NET type accessors GetValueGetValues, in which case you have to use the readers ODP.NET type accessor GetProviderSpecificValue, which gives you an OracleDecimal, and if it overflows a Decimal, its Value property will give you an overflow exception and your only recourse is to coerce it into a lesser type with one of OracleDecimals ToXxx methods.p  pBut of course the ODP.NET type accessor is not part of the IDataReader interface used by Dapper to hold reader objects, so it seems that Dapper, by itself, is Oracleincompatible when a column type will overflow all .NET types. p  pThe question remains  do the smart folk know how to extend Dapper to handle this. It seems to me Id need an extension point where I could provide implementation on how to use the reader forcing it to use GetDouble instead of GetValue, or casting to OracleDataReader and calling GetProviderSpecificValue for certain POCO property or column types.p

Negative 352 pI have some MVC4 code that I am maintaining. A previous developer created a page with both a search button and a download button, and both are submit buttons.  After the page is posted, he checks codeRequest.FormbtnDownload  nullcode to see if the download button has been clicked, which works fine BUT the download caused by that button does not return the view, it returns a codeCSVResultcode which returns a code.csvcode file for Excel.  So then the next time the OTHER submit button is clicked, the codebtnDownloadcode element is still not null, and the code thinks the download button has been clicked.  p  pI tried another method for two submit buttons I found on Stack Overflow adding a codeCommandcode element with different values, but that method leaves all the buttons disabled when one is clicked.p  pI need a way to remove codebtnDownloadcode from the post variables with JavaScript or any other way you can suggest to accomplish this.p  pI short, I have a search button and a download button both of which cause a post, but only the search button returns the view.  How can I put something in JavaScript at the beginning of the page that puts the codebtnDownloadcode button in its initial state so that it will not be returned in codeRequest.Formcodep  pHere is the code.  This code is reused on a number of pages, this is just some search value text boxes, a search button, a Clear reset search button and a download button.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse

Negative 352 pI was successful transforming XML to PDF using Apache FOP 1.1 embedded in a Java application. Unfortunately, Ive been instructed to downgrade to FOP 1.0 in order to comply with company licencing.

In the event a codeuncaughtExceptioncode occurs, this will result in all of the data currently waiting to be transmitted to be lost.pli lipThere is a codenewrelic.noticeErrorcode which is supposed to take a second argument allowing you to pass custom parameters with an error.

Without the codeuncaughtExceptioncode handler I dont get anything to New Relic. The issue is that I cant differentiate between the errors which crash the process, and normal HTTP 500 errors. p  pHeres something things Ive triedp  ol lipIf I attempt to add code crash  true code to the codenoticeErrorcode call it doesnt seem to have any affect. pli lipIve tried to do codedomaincode instead of codeprocess.oncode, that doesnt change the situation. pli lipIf I attempt to alter the codenamecode of the error, such as codeerr.name  CrashErrorcode then the error doesnt get transmitted at all.pli lipIf I create a custom error type, and then new that, and copy the stack trace on to it, it still reports as type codeErrorcode rather than the codeprototype.namecode of my new error type.pli ol

Negative 352 pI would like to have a list to control what keys are currently down in an application made in qt. I used the codekeyPressEventcode and codekeyReleaseEventcode for controlling when a key gets pressed and put in the list and removing it when it gets released using the codeevent.keycode. The problem is that when a key is down it doesnt leave the key as pressed, it alternates the event between released and pressed. Now, the codeisAutoRepeatcode function controls if the key is repeated, so if this is false then I add or remove the key. This works just fine in Windows but in Linux the codeisAutoRepeatcode function always return false and the key alternates between pressed and released when it is in fact pressed. What i like to do is to have in the list the keys that the user is pressing right now, for example for a WASD control, so my question is if there is a way to control this using pure Qt because i have emulated this behaviour measuring the time when the previous key was pressed or released. My functions are as followsp  precodedef keyPressEventself, event     if not event.isAutoRepeat         self.keys.appendevent.key  def keyReleaseEventself, event     if not event.isAutoRepeat         self.keys.removeevent.key codepre

Negative 352 h3 Hey, i am about to make a form which should contain 4 dropdownlists... And by dropdownlists i mean selects in htmlphp  the preview of what i am thinking about, theres a link in the bottom, so you can get a better understanding of what i am talking about. h3  p Ive been searching for some, and i found this code in a tutorial, it is working and all this, but i would like to have 4 dropdownlists instead of only 2. I have seen some without querystring, but this code is with querystring, and im not quite the best at php, but i understand a lot, thats not a problem, but problem is, that i would like to get rid of querystring and get 2 more dropdownlist, but i dont know the way to do it. br br its not a problem to get 2 more dropdownlist, but to get 2 more dropdownlist working like the link in the bottom. br br I want it to work so i have to choose the first dropdownlist and rest are disabled or just empty, and when i choose in the first dropdownlist the second dropdownlist will be enabled or filled with data which is connected with the first like, a car and in the next BMW etc. should show up, and then when you have choosed in the second dropdownlist, the third dropdownlist will be enabled or filled with data just like the second one, but now if you choose BMW you should pick a model like M5 or M3 etc. and when you have done that, you will be able to pick the engine of the M5 or M3 or whatever you are choosing. p  precode Getting the data from Mysql table for first list box quer2SELECT DISTINCT category,catid FROM category order by category   End of query for first list box   for second drop down list we will check if category is selected else we will display all the subcategory  ifissetcat and strlencat gt 0 querSELECT DISTINCT subcategory FROM subcategory where catidcat order by subcategory  elsequerSELECT DISTINCT subcategory FROM subcategory order by subcategory    end of query for second subcategory drop down list box   echo ltform methodpost namef1 actionddcheck.phpgt  Add your form processing page address to action in above line.

The site was reverified in Webmaster tools, all links were checked and a valid sitemap was resubmitted and received with no errors, no crawl errors and all looks fine and still does in webmaster tools. However it has been weeks and the website is NOT being indexed at all Not even the homepage, and all data analytical graphs in Webmaster tools are taking a dive. NOT COOLp  pThe URL is a hrefhttpberkowitz.com.au relnofollowberkowitz.com.auap  pThe websites sitemap can be viewed a hrefhttpberkowitz.com.ausitemap.xml relnofollowherea.p  pWhen doing a simple google search for berkowitz furniture or berkowitz.com.au it returns no results for that website at all, which is completely puzzling Doing a google index check by googling siteberkowitz.com.au returns no pages also which tells me that the site is not being indexed.

Negative 352 pI was really disappointed by the performance I got on the following simple ReactJS example. When clicking on an item, the label count gets updated accordingly. Unfortunately, this takes roughly 0.51 second to get updated. Thats mainly due to rerendering the entire todo list.p  pMy understanding is that Reacts key design decision is to make the API seem like it rerenders the whole app on every update. It is supposed take the current state of the DOM and compare it with the target DOM representation, do a diff and update only the things that need to get updated. p  pAm I doing something which is not optimal I could always update the count label manually and the state silently and that will be an almost instant operation but that takes away the point of using ReactJS.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode jsx React.DOM   TodoItem  React.createClass      getDefaultProps function           return              completedCallback function                   console.lognot callback provided                           ,     getInitialState function           return this.props     ,      updateCompletedState function           var isCompleted  this.state.data.completed         this.setState.extendthis.state.data,              completed isCompleted                  this.props.completedCallbackisCompleted     ,      render function           var renderContext  this.state.data              ltli classNametodoitem  this.state.data.completed     strikethrough  gt                 ltinput onClickthis.updateCompletedState typecheckbox checkedthis.state.data.completed  checked   gt                 ltspan onClickthis.updateCompletedState classNamedescriptiongtthis.state.data.descriptionltspangt             ltligt  null          return renderContext         var TodoList  React.createClass     getInitialState function           return              todoItems this.props.data.todoItems,             completedTodoItemsCount 0              ,      updateCount function isCompleted          this.setState.extendthis.state,              completedTodoItemsCount isCompleted  this.state.completedTodoItemsCount  1  this.state.completedTodoItemsCount  1              ,          render function           var updateCount  this.updateCount         return              ltdivgt                 ltdivgtcount this.state.completedTodoItemsCountltdivgt                 ltul classNametodolistgt                      this.state.todoItems.mapfunction todoItem                          return ltTodoItem data todoItem  completedCallback updateCount  gt                                       ltulgt             ltdivgt                 var data  todoItems [], i  0  whilei lt 1000  data.todoItems.pushdescription Comment   i, completed false   React.renderComponentltTodoList data data  gt, document.bodycodepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpfb.mereactjsfiddleintegration.jsgtltscriptgtcodepre div div p  psubjsFiddle link, just in case a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9nrnz1qm3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net9nrnz1qm3asubp

There is a button, save on view, which when clicked should keep the changed model as it isNothing to do, since model values are changed on events, on clicking of save i have the changed model. But if the DialogView is closed without clicking on save, then the changes made in model should not persist and it should revert to its original state.p  pI used Backbones model.clone method as shown above in DialogView code. But it seems clone is not creating a copy of original model but simply referring to the same model. Whenever value in this.model change, value in realModel also change. I want that when events are fired then values get changed in the model of DialogView but the original model which was sent to DialogView remain as it is so that if i close the DialogView without saving then the values in model passed to this view remain unchanged.p  pAs per BAckbone documentaion, clone creates a new Instance of a model but my research above seems to give different results.

Negative 352 pUsing Xcode 6.2 with the Single View Project Template storyboards I have a view controller I load from the storyboard during codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode. p  pBy this point in the initialization flow I can see that my scroll views bounds are correct its the size of its superview. If, however, I attempt to tell the newly loaded view controllers view, which has been added as a subview of the scrollView, that it should be the size of its superview the scrollView it results in that view being a size of 0x0. If I specify an explicit size, using the width and height of the bounds of the scroll view, everything works great. So I clearly do not understand the pitfalls of pinning leadingtrailing topbottom space to a superview.p  pMy initialization code is as followsp  precodeoverride func viewDidLayoutSubviews      grey  storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierGreyViewController as GreyViewController     grey.view.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsfalse       add the subview     scrollView.addSubviewgrey.view       dimensions     var width  scrollView.bounds.width     var height  scrollView.bounds.height       set the constraints     var h1  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[grey],         options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views [grey grey.view]      var v1  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[grey],         options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views [grey grey.view]      scrollView.addConstraintsh1  v1  codepre  pAgain, if I change the constraints to specify explicit widths and heights, everything worksp  precodevar h1  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[greywidth],     options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views [grey grey.view]  var v1  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[greyheight],     options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views [grey grey.view] codepre  pWhat I am missing here is that if the superview, in this case the scrollview, has a known widthheight as evidenced by the width and height variables declared above, why would pinning to those values produce a size of 0x0 but explicitly setting them, everything works out great p  pI would have thought that, in this case, the explicit setting would have been the same as the pinning to the leadingtrailing topbottom spacing.p  pA bit more infop  pI found a post herep  pa hrefhttpspin.atomicobject.com20140305uiscrollviewautolayoutios relnofollowhttpspin.atomicobject.com20140305uiscrollviewautolayoutiosap  pWhere the author states thatp  blockquote   pEven though your content view cannot depend on the scroll view for   size, you must add top, bottom, leading, and trailing constraints from   your content view to your scroll view. This part is the most confusing   because Apple has repurposed the constraints in this case to indicate   to the UIScrollView the boundaries of your content and therefore   calculate the content size.  These special constraints, from your   content view to the UIScrollView, do not behave like normal   constraints. No matter what constant value you give them, they will   not resize your content view.p blockquote  pSo it appears that constraints behave differently in the scrollview This would explain what I am seeing. So instead of setting the constraints to their superview, which is a a scrollview in this case, I would need to set them to the scrollviews superview.  Although, the author in that article states thatp  blockquote   pNo matter what constant value you give them, they will   not resize your content view.p blockquote  pWhich is also not what I observe. When I give the view explicit values for width and height, it works, just not when pinning. Just trying to understand the nuance here.p  pI can do the following and it will work as expected without an explicit widthheight set. I just set the width and height constraint to the scrollviews superviewp  precodeoverride func viewDidLayoutSubviews      grey  storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierGreyViewController as GreyViewController     grey.view.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsfalse      scrollView.addSubviewgrey.view      var l1  NSLayoutConstraintitem grey.view,         attribute .Width,         relatedBy .Equal,         toItem view,         attribute .Width,         multiplier 1,         constant 0      var r1  NSLayoutConstraintitem grey.view,         attribute .Height,         relatedBy .Equal,         toItem view,         attribute .Height,         multiplier 1,         constant 0       view.addConstraints[l1, r1]  codepre  pThis would also do the trickp  precodevar w1  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[greyview],             options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views [grey grey.view, view view]  var h1  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[greyview],     options NSLayoutFormatOptions0, metrics nil, views [grey grey.view, view view]  view.addConstraintsw1  h1 codepre  pI just cant seem to use pinning for leadingtrailing topbottom to have it calculate its widthheight when its within a scrollview.p

Any suggestions on how to streamline the code to be faster andor how to send and receive the right data would be much appreciatedp  pPython p  precodesources httpstackoverflow.comquestions676172fullexamplesofusingpyserialpackage for more info httppyserial.sourceforge.netpyserialapi.html  import serial  import time  sets the connection parameters, relook at when know more ser  serial.Serial     port COM4,      baudrate  9600,      parity  serial.PARITYODD,      stopbits  serial.STOPBITSTWO,      bytesize  serial.EIGHTBITS,     timeout  5       def decToPercent decimal     maps value from 01 to 0255 and makes into an interger, then to hex     intPercent  rounddecimal255     return intPercent  ser.isOpen    returns true  firstContact  False  inByte  0 wrist  0.9         setup of variables which I will get from dictionary of other code once integrate elbow  0       assuming variables will be included in 01     wristPerc  decToPercentwrist elbowPerc  decToPercentelbow  forceBytes  bytearray[wristPerc, elbowPerc]      puts the motor values into an array as hex printforceBytes  set up initial contact with the arduino  inByte  ser.read1 printinByte  while True     if firstContact  False          if inByte  bA              firstContact  True             ser.writea.encode             inByte  ser.read1      else          ser.writeforceBytes         time.sleep0.05         printser.readline codepre  pInitially I had the code start  and go back through the whole while statement after  using this code, however I took it out because I think it was making the flow of code mess up the outputs a littlep  precode    starts the process over again, clears so that have time to get information     firstContact  False             inByte  ser.read1     printinByte codepre  pArduino codep  precodeSee Arduino Cookbook chapter 4 for info on sending and recieving multiple messages in one See example of serial call response for strategy on how to process information faster int motorPinLeft  10 int motorPinRight  11  int motorSpeedLeft  0 int motorSpeedRight  0  int fieldIndex  1 char values[2]    array holding values for the fields we expect  char newByte  0  void setup    pinModemotorPinLeft, OUTPUT   pinModemotorPinRight, OUTPUT   Serial.begin9600   whileSerial waits for arduino to be ready, not neaded for duo   establishContact   void loop     while Serial.availablegt0    checks to see if anything needs to be sent,                               denoted by recieveing signal from pySerial       char inByte  Serial.read        switch inByte                case 97           inByte  0           break          default            values[0]  inByte           could just call Serial.read and asign 2nd byte, but loop allows to send more variables later           if fieldIndex lt 2                        newByte  Serial.read             values[fieldIndex]  newByte             fieldIndex                       else                        Serial.printvalues[0], DEC    debugging purposes              Serial.printvalues[1], DEC              motorSpeedLeft  values[0]             motorSpeedRight  values[1]              Serial.printmotorSpeedLeft             Serial.printmotorSpeedRight              analogWritemotorPinLeft, motorSpeedLeft             analogWritemotorPinRight, motorSpeedRight               delay3000       to make the motor vibrate for 1 second              motorSpeedRight  0             motorSpeedLeft  0              analogWritemotorPinLeft, motorSpeedLeft             analogWritemotorPinRight, motorSpeedRight              delay1000                          Serial.printA         allows arduino to be ready before pySerial sends any messages void establishContact    while Serial.availablelt0         Serial.printA     delay300     codepre  pOutputp  precodebytearraybxb2x00 bA b0Kxfe bx13j10kxfe bx13j10kxfe codepre  pMy motor is running each time a print statement occurs, so I am not sure if it is just my print statements that are messing up, rather than the actual serial communicationp  pOne additional thing I am unsure of, is in my switchcase statement in the arduino code, I am using the ascii code for a 97 instead of actually putting a.

Negative 352 pIm attempting to modify an image carousel Ive created initially just to have four pictures. The way mine is setup is one large image and then under it four thumbnail images. I had previous and next buttons to navigate through the images on the large image.

Now the images are just plopped into place.

Negative 352 pIm writing a program using c and MVVM pattern. This program has an online connection, which requires a login. Ive created a model class to handle the login process. p  pThe login process goes like this the login credentials user name and password are sent to a login page online, and on successful login, the server sends back login cookies. I store those cookies locally, and send them with each request from the server, until they expire.p  pIve created a GetLoginCookies method in the model, which Id like to be the only method to get the login cookies. The login in this method is as follows get the stored login cookies, and verify them with the server. If there are no login cookies, or they are invalid e.g. expired, the ask the user for new credentials, and send them to the server and get new login cookies.p  pThe reason I want to handle everything in one method, is that I want to have one method that will always give me valid login cookies or abort the operation that I can use before any communication with the server.p  pMy question is, whats the best way to implement the user input when using MVVM patternp

Negative 352 pI am working on a High Availability solution using multiinstance queue managers and F5 BigIPLTM host which holds the pool of active and passive MQ nodes.

In order to achieve this I like to know all the  internal checks performed by a multiinstance queue manager before switching from Active node to passive node so that I can apply the same logic on our health check scripts.

Negative 352 pI have swift 2.0 ios app with storyboard. I have a tableViewController and in each row I have scrollView with user scrolling disabled. Inside this scrollView I have an image, which fits scrolls size and its a bit taller. Thing is I want to achieve floating effect on this image, when tableView is scrolled.  Heres a codep  precode    override func scrollViewDidScrollscrollView UIScrollView          let cells  tableView.visibleCells          let offsetY  scrollView.contentOffset.y          var diffCGFloat  offsetY  lastY  10          for cell in cells              let indexPath  tableView.indexPathForCellcell              let scroll  cell.viewWithTag102 as UIScrollView             let oldY  scroll.contentOffset.y             let newY  oldY  diff             let height  scroll.contentSize.height             ifnewY gt 0 ampamp newY  cellHeight lt height                 scroll.contentOffset  CGPointMakescroll.contentOffset.x, newY                           ifindexPath.row  0                 printoldY  diff  newY                                lastY  offsetY      codepre  pWhat Im doing here is calculating difference of tableView scroll position variable diff, get all visible cells and scroll scrollViews by that difference divided by 10 and in opposite direction.

Negative 352 pI am new to sharedptr and smart pointers in general. My idea was that the smart pointers generally dont leak memory. I was writing a HUGE linked list file, and getting some memory leak strongafterstrong I converted all the raw pointers to smart ones. I am using a linked list with arbitrary nodes where every node has a codenextcode pointer, as well as codearbcode pointer, which points to arbitrary node in the same linked list. This emmightem create cyclic pointers. Question is, how do I get rid of the memory leaks in the presence of cyclic pointersp  pcodeLinkedList.hppcodep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodepragma once  include ltexceptiongt include

Negative 352 pMy iOS app receives temperatureetc data from another device, a peripheral.  I can receive events at any time, but want to be able to navigate to other screens while the temperature samples are being collected and not lose any samples.

Ive broken this out as a singleton class that inherits from codeNSObjectcode, codeMyDevicecode.p  pIm trying to figure out how to manage all the events coming in and have new screens be able to subscribe and unsubscribe from these events all the time as a user moves throughout the app.  Does it make sense for this class to keep the overall codeproperty strong, nonatomic CBCentralManager code and implement codeCBCentralManagerDelegatecode  How is this commonly managedp
