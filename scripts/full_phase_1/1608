Positive 1608 pI need to write SOAP service that doesnt need tomcatglassfishwildfly to deploy itp  pIs there any library in Java that implement JAXWS specificationp  pWith Spring Boot project I can write SOAP service, but it seems that run embedded tomcat. p
Positive 1608 pForgive me if this is a dumb question, I unfortunately have an assignment due I am running apache axis under tomcat and need to deploy a simple web service class, see below. p  pI installed the counter file below as MyCounter.jws in the tomcatwebappsaxis folder. Tomcat finds it and makes a corresponding MyCounter.xml. I use WSDL2Java on the XML file and client calls seem to work, but internal state is not savedp  pEvery time I call MyCounter.call from the client side, the return value is always 1. It seems the constructor is always called before the method call. How can I make it so the mycounter integer persists across requestsp  precodepublic class MyCounter      int mycounter      public MyCounter              mycounter  0           public int call              mycounter         return mycounter       codepre
Positive 1608 pI have a set of soap webservices that are tightly coupled to an application within the same architecture but I need it to also be an API for other applications to hook into.p  pAt the moment, the services use a parameter and method structure like thisp  pstrongEntity GetEntityint entityId Entity GetEntityByNamestring entityNamestrong .... etc.p  pIn the case of creates I use strongvoid CreateEntityEntity entitystrongp  pI am wondering though would it be better to do it like thisp  pstrongEntityResponse GetEntityEntityRequest requestObjstrong ..... p  pand in the requestObj I have id, entityName and depending what the user supplies, I can perform either function.p  pand for the create it would bep  pstrongCreateEntityResponse CreateEntityCreateEntityRequest requestObj.strongp  pMy thinking is that by doing it like this, the API can change internally...add new parameters etc without immediately breaking any integration that has already been done.p

Positive 1608 pWhat would be an appropriate REST compatible approach that would allow a client to call a RESTful service in order to convert a large document to a target format p  pI was thinking about something similar to this p  ol liClient makes a codePOSTcode on codeconversionrequestcode resource with conversion configuration target type, secure key, notification resource URL in the form a hrefhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusid relnofollowhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusida that will return a request id. The conversion request would be added to an internal queue and can be modified  deleted by the client as long as the conversion is not started.li liOnce conversion is started the codeconversionrequestidcode is deleted by the serverli liOnce conversion is done the server creates a codeconversionresultidcode same id as above in 1 resource then does a PUT on the notification status resource to set it to ready and providing the key which will inform the client of the completion of its request li liWhen ready the client makes a codeGETcode on codeconversionresultidcode resource to obtain the converted documentli liIf the client went offline for any reason, he can try to retrieve the result as in 4. If the document is not ready, the client just has to wait for the notification to be sent.li ol  pHowever...p  ol liIs it a valid approach li lishould I forget about using REST and should I rather think about using SOAP and have a blocking call, knowing that I would prefer avoiding blocking calls or JMS all approaches have their proscons, and one big cons against JMS in my context is that it would require the setup of queues for all clients which may be refused note thats why I also added SOAP and JMS tags to this questionli liAny idea of how to improve the approach and what are the questions I should think about before going any further li ol  pThanks in advance for your help p  pMichelp
Positive 1608 pI found a question that asks the opposite of what Im trying to do here.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2142813addingmethodstothewebservicedooldclientsneedtoupdatewebreferencesAdding methods to the webservice do old clients need to update web referencesap  pBut, basically I have a web service that I inherited and there were originally grand plans but ultimately only a handful of methods were actually being called. Id like to remove to clean up the code some. p  pIt is used only internally and I can verify the only methods being used. The problem is that I cant update the client wsdl at the moment. So if I remove the calls from the web service but the clients wsdl isnt updated does that cause problems p  pKeep in mind I am completely positive these methods arent used as its all internal and we control the programs that use the web service. We can update the wsdl for the clients the next time these programs are updated but that will likely be next year.p

Positive 1608 pIm using the catalogProductAttributeMediaCreate V2 SOAP service call to create images for products. This worked fine for months but has been failing since a couple of days. The API call itself returns a strongsuccessfulstrong action. No exception is thrown by Magento and the call returns an image id in the form of a string like feferrarif12berlinettawallpaperspicturesbackgrounds.jpg4.jpg. But when I check the magento admin backend, no images are shown. When I check the table in mysql I notice that magento hasnt created a record for it. Even though the API call returns a success. Adding images through the admin backend manually works fine. Ive reinstalled the entire magento site. But the fauls persists. When I use the API to remove the image it returns an exception, telling me that the image feferrarif12berlinettawallpaperspicturesbackgrounds.jpg4.jpg does not exist. Which makes sense as its not present in the database.p  pSo, why does the API returns a successful action and an image ID, when it obviously fails. And where do I start to troubleshootp

Thats why, WSS4JStaxOutInterceptor invokes too. And in my custom interceptor I receive an XML body, where the outer signature already there. So, i cant sign internal node, because outer signature will be invalid.p  pIs there a way to get XML body from SoapMessage on PRESTREAM phase without invoking next phasep

Negative 1608 pWhile plenty of solutions exist for entering dates such as calendars, dropdown menus, etc., it doesnt seem like there are too many standard ways to ask for a time or time range.p  pIve personally tried dropdown menus for the hour, minute, and second fields and sometimes an AMPM field, as well.  Ive also tried several clocklike input devices, most of which are too hard to use for the typical enduser.  Ive even tried popout time selection menus which allow you to, for example, hover over the hour 10 to receive a submenu that contains 00,15,30, and 45  but none of these methods seem natural.p  pSo far, the best and most universal method I have found is just using simple text fields and forcing a user to manually populate the hour, minute, and second.  Alternatively, Ive had good experiences creating something similar to Outlooks Day View which allows you to drag and drop an event to set the start and end times.p  pIs there a best way to ask for this information  Is anybody using some type of time input widget thats really intuitive and easy to use  Or is there at least a way thats more efficient than using plain text boxesp

So an XML Ajax response gets split up into multiple text child nodes instead of only one node. Its fine in Internet Explorer. For Firefox, to get the full data you either need to use node.normalize before you call node.firstChild or use node.textContent, both of which are Mozilla specific methodsli liInternet Explorer does not replace codeampnbspcode or HTML char code 160, you need to replace its Unicode equivalent u00a0li liIn Firefox a dynamically created input field inside a form created using document.createElement does not pass its value on form submit.li lidocument.getElementById in Internet Explorer will return an element even if the element name matches. Mozilla only returns element if id matches.li liIn Internet Explorer if a select box has a value not represented by any of the options, it will display blank, Firefox displays the first option.li ul

Negative 1608 pIm having trouble designing a good architecture for a particular portion of my application, especially where maintaining state is involved.p  pI have a group of parsing operationsp  pMy class codeReadercode reads in a block of data into a buffer and handles the overall control flow. My class codeParsercode takes the block of data in the buffer and a codeParsedDataHandlercode, and divides it up into smaller chunks for the codeParsedDataHandlercode to manage.p  pcodeParsedDataHandlercode is an interface that I am trying to design I think I want to do something like this BlockInfo represents some data structure containing various bits of state that will include a ByteBuffer holding the entire block of raw data. ChunkMetadata represents information including the position of each chunk within the block, and any other information the codeParsercode has determined about the chunkp  precodeinterface ParsedDataHandler      void beginBlockBlockInfo bi     void handleParsedDataBlockInfo bi, ChunkMetadata m     void endBlockBlockInfo bi  codepre  pso codeReadercode will call codeParsedDataHandler.beginBlockcode to let it set up any state at the beginning of a block, and is committed to leaving a designated portion probably all of the BlockInfo constant until it makes a matching call to codeParsedDataHandler.endBlockcode  afterwards it might reuse the data buffer for the next block. codeParsercode runs through the data block and splits it into chunks according to a predefined data protocol, and will call codeParsedDataHandler.handleParsedDatacode multiple times, once for each chunk. One reason for the contract to include a buffer that remains fixed, is so that codeParsedDataHandlercode can copy the whole block of data at the beginning or end, and doesnt have to reassemble the chunks into the one block when they were there together all the time.p  pSo theres a division of responsibilityp  ul licodeReadercode is just responsible for managing the overall routine and reading in the data, it couldnt care less about anything else. li licodeParsercode is the thing that splits the data block into chunks and it couldnt care less about what to do with them or how the data got thereli licodeParsedDataHandlercode is the interface Im trying to design so that concrete classes can implement it and work correctly, without codeReadercode or codeParsercode caring what it does, or without it caring about how to divide up the block into chunks or where the data came from.li ul  pMy question is, should the burden on maintaining any state be on the class implementing codeParsedDataHandlercode and kept out of BlockInfo And if the semantics of my interface include the fact that the raw data block in BlockInfo will not change between calls of beginBlock and endBlock, should I then only pass it in to beginBlock and not to the other calls or is it okay to send it along for conveniences sakep  pIs there a better design pattern to handle a situation like thisp
Negative 1608 pCan anyone provide a sample  link to a sample Cocoa app that changes the hardware cursor in a fullscreen OpenGL Cocoa app  I have been able to create a full screen GL app and an app that changes the cursor by overriding NSViewresetCursorRects but I have not been able to get both to work simultaneously.  Ive also refitted some of the Apple GL samples CocoaGL, Custom Cocoa OpenGL, etc by overriding NSViewresetCursorRects and I havent been able to get the cursor to change in fullscreen in them either.  I have the book OpenGL Programming on Mac OS X which also avoids the problem.  p  pChristopher I hadnt tried [NSCursor set].  Good call but I made a run at it and no luck.  It still returns to the system cursor.  Id say that perhaps something is overriding it in my calls that switch to fullscreen but Ive actually tried reseting the mouse cursor in my NSViews draw routine which gets called repeatedly and the cursor never switches from the system default.p

Thoughtsp  pAs a sidenote, it is possible to capture the referring URL or any incoming traffic, right  So if they came from a forum post or something, you can track that actual URL, is that rightp  pIt just seems that this is a very standard requirement and I dont want to go reinventing the wheel.p  pAs always, thanks for the insight SOF.p

Negative 1608 pI was searching for a script or at least a code snippet but havent really made any progress. Anyway, Im looking for a script that works like a simple pagination javascript but it should be accessable by linking from anywhere in the document and by calling it with the URL e.g. on www.abc.dedefault.htmlthirddiv the third page of the pagination is displayed. Further, the contents should be loaded upon request when the user clicks on the link and enters the specific page of the pagination, so that cookies, that have been set or deleted in the same document earlier can be used later without reloading the entire page. Something like that is used on Facebook for calling contents and loading them.p  pIve found a script on CSS Tricks called BetterBlogroll but I dont really get my mind into this. A pagination script from DynamicDrive is already working very well on the page but my problem is that there should be running three of them on the same page and as I said, the content should be loaded upon the users request.p  pThe script Id need does not has to be with loads of CSS, best way would be plain javascript and only the required CSS and HTML data. Anything else just disturbs. If anyone can help me out here, Id be very thankful.p

Negative 1608 pI am setting up a website for students of a school, which must include a schedule page which will show a calendar with events populated by feeds from various teachers calendars. After trying out a variety of scripts and tools made for showing calendars, I finally hit upon a very shoddy, hackedtogether way of doing it, and I want to know if theres any specific things wrong with my implementation. p  pMy requirements from this calendar are posted in a previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1493919bestwaytoimplementacalendarinterfaceusinggooglecalfeedsforeventsquestiona This is how my implementation is gonna workp  pThe teachers make their schedules in their own calendar programs and make those feeds available in the iCal format. A common Google account for the school subcribes to all these calendars, and so gets read only access to ALL the teachers schedules in school. Google Calendar has a feature that lets you select some of your calendars, and then get the html code for an iframe to embed on your website, so that visitors to the site can see what events are coming up. When I experimented around with the options in the Google Configurator, I found that by simply including certain codes in the url called for the iframe contents, you could change which calendars were visible. These codes, or calendar ids, are clearly displayed in the settings for each calendar. Thus, my final solution is thusp  pFor every student, there is a record stating which courses he has taken, and hence which calendars he should be shown. With some SQL magic, I can retrieve the calendar ids from a preprepared database of all the calendar ids, and then generate the correct url for the iframe using php, and display it.p  pI hope that wasnt too convoluted to understand. Now can anyone tell me if there are any inherent security flaws or bad programming practices etc in this. Something about the whole idea of dynamically generating urls, using iframes, using a common google account etc just screams Mistake. Can someone tell me if this is an ok way to go about it, or is there some problem with itp
Negative 1608 pI have a complex query that I need to use in a subsequent query actually update statement.  I have tried both using a CTE and a temp table.  The performance using the CTE is horrible vs the temp table approach.  Its something like 15 seconds vs milliseconds. To simplify the test instead of joining the CTETemp table in the subsequent query I simply selected  from it.  In that case they perform the same.p  pI Have Looked at The Execution Plan for both approaches both with the joins in the subsequent query and then simply select .  With the simple select the query plans are about the same, but with the joins in the subsequent select the query plans are not.  Specifically the portion of the query plan for creating and populating the temp table stays the same, while the query plan portion for creating and populating the CTE changes dramatically when it is subsequently used in a query with a join.p  pMy question is why does the query plan for the creation and population of the CTE change by how it is subsequently used while the temp table is not.  Also in what scenarios then would a CTE yield better performance than a temp tablep  pNote I have used a table variable as well and it is comparable to the temp table approach.p  pThanksp

Negative 1608 pSo after much debate back and forth, Ive come up with what I emthinkem may be a valid plan to handle ApplicationSystem errors vs User Errors I.e. Validation Issues, Permission Issues etc.p  pApplicationSystem Errors will be handled using a custom error handler via seterrorhandler. Depending on the severity of the error, the user may be redirected to a generic error page I.e. Fatal Error, or the error may simply be silently logged i.e EWARNING.p  pThese errors are ones most likely caused by issues outside the users control Missing file, Bad logic, etc.p  pThe second set of errors would be User Generated ones. These are the ones may not automatically trigger an error but would be considered one. In these cases ive decided to use the triggererror function and typically throw a waning or notice which would be logged silently by the error handler. After that it would be up to the developer to then redirect the user to another page or display some sort of more meaningful message to the user.p  pThis way an error of any type is always logged, but user errors still allow the developer freedom to handle it in their own ways. I.e. Redirect them back to their form with it fully repopulated and a message of what went wrong.p  pDoes anyone see anything wrong with this, or have a more intuitive way My approach to error handling is typically everyone has their own ways but there must be a way instituted.p

Negative 1608 pI have a simple entity, Code, that I need to persist to a MySQL database.p  precodepublic class Code implements Serializable       Id     private String key     private String description      ...getters and setters...  codepre  pThe user supplies a file full of key, description pairs which I read, convert to Code objects and then insert in a single transaction using em.mergecode. The file will generally have duplicate entries which I deal with by first adding them to a map keyed on the key field as I read them in. p  pA problem arises though when keys differ only by case for example XYZ and XyZ. My map will, of course, contain both entries but during the merge process MySQL sees the two keys as being the same and the call to merge fails with a MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException. p  pI could easily fix this by uppercasing the keys as I read them in but Id like to understand exactly what is going wrong. The conclusion I have come to is that JPA considers XYZ and XyZ to be different keys but MySQL considers them to be the same. As such when JPA checks its list of known keys or does whatever it does to determine whether it needs to perform an insert or update it fails to find the previous insert and issuing another which then fails. Is this corrent Is there anyway round this other than better filtering the client datap  pI havent defined .equals or .hashCode on the Code class so perhaps this is the problem.p

Negative 1608 pFrom the docsp  blockquote   pIf you change the input value in a   validateerror method, you must   ensure that you only change the value   if it is invalid or uncoerced. The   reason is that, since the object and   context are now dirtied, Core Data may   validate that key again later. If you   keep performing a coercion in a   validation method, this can therefore   produce an infinite loop.p blockquote  pSo when I modify a value in a validation method, the context gets dirtied And the next time I save, the validation happens again  and when I change the value even if the validation is OK, then the context is again dirtied, and revalidated again  and I change the value, and Core Data validates, again, because the context is dirtied. And so on...for ever... is that right Or did they try to say something differentp

I know.  assName.  Also, even if this isnt the best design, that is beyond my control.  Im just trying to query an existing set of data.  p  pI should also mention there are over 500 assumption types ass1,ass2,...,ass500,etc and each type could have over 100 assumption refKeyNames per assumption type.p  pIm trying to wrap my head around this and it seems easy, but I just cant figure out how to do it.  Any ideas  Maybe there is a concept Im missing because I just havent encountered it yet.  Im okay with hardcoding the column names assName1, assName2 etc into my query, but even then Im unsure how to lookup the assNames from the Assumptions table when it seems like Im looking up from the same table for multiple columns in my result.p  pEDIT I ommitted something really important.  refkey is reused in the Assumptions Table.  So an assName is uniquely determined by the combination of assType and refKey.  I apologize for not making that clear in my example  I forgot about that until I looked at the answers.  I have changed my example to reflect this as well.p  pEDIT2 I am using MS SQL Server.p  pEDIT3 I expect to find match in the assumptions table for every plan.  If not, I would have bigger problems  unrelated to this question though.p

Because codeTHREADCREATE...code failed, the program never get a chance to run codedoserverloopcode in codeserverthread...code, which explains why the server never got the data from client.p  pHow should I interpret the return values from codepthreadcreatecode and how should I fix it PS. I later used codestrerrorcode to convert code4294967295code and it returned Unknown error.p  pAny help will be much appreciatedp  pp  pHere is codeserver.ccodep  precodeinclude common.h  void doserverloopBIO conn      int err, nread     char buf[80]      do              fprintfstderr, serverloop executed.n         fornread  0 nread lt sizeofbuf nread  err                      err  BIOreadconn, buf  nread, sizeofbuf  nread             iferr lt 0                 break                               fwritebuf, 1, nread, stdout          while err gt 0   void THREADCC serverthreadvoid arg      fprintfstderr, serverthreadvoid arg executed.n     BIO client  BIO arg ifndef WIN32     pthreaddetachpthreadself endif     fprintfstderr, Connection opened.n     doserverloopclient     fprintfstderr, Connection closed.n      BIOfreeclient     ERRremovestate0 ifdef WIN32     endthread else     return 0 endif    int mainint argc, char argv[]      BIO     acc, client     int threadcreateresult     THREADTYPE tid      initOpenSSL      acc  BIOnewacceptPORT     ifacc         interrorError creating server socket           ifBIOdoacceptacc lt 0         interrorError binding server socket             for              ifBIOdoacceptacc lt 0             interrorError accepting connection                  client  BIOpopacc         threadcreateresult  THREADCREATEtid, serverthread, client         ifthreadcreateresult  0             fprintfstderr, THREADCREATE failed returns s.n,                                              strerrorthreadcreateresult             fprintfstderr, threadcreateresult has the value u.n,                                              threadcreateresult             exit1                    BIOfreeacc     return 0  codepre  pHere is codecommon.hcodep  precodeinclude lterrno.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include ltnetdb.hgt include ltnetinetin.hgt include ltnetinettcp.hgt include ltopensslbio.hgt include ltopensslerr.hgt include ltopensslhmac.hgt include ltopensslobjects.hgt include ltopensslrand.hgt include ltopensslssl.hgt include ltopensslx509.hgt include ltopensslx509v3.hgt include ltsignal.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstrings.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltunistd.hgt   ifndef WIN32 include ltpthread.hgt define THREADCC  define THREADTYPE         pthreadt define THREADCREATEtid, entry, arg  pthreadcreateamptid, NULL,                                     entry, arg else include ltwindows.hgt include ltprocess.hgt define THREADCC              cdecl define THREADTYPE            DWORD define THREADCREATEtid, entry, arg do  beginthreadentry, 0, arg                         tid  GetCurrentThreadId                         while 0 endif  define PORT    6012      port define SERVER  10.1.251.24   server address define CLIENT  10.1.21.46    client address  define interrormsg handleerrorFILE, LINE, msg void handleerrorconst char file, int lineno, const char msg  void initOpenSSLvoid codepre  pMakefilep  precodeCC  gcc OPENSSLDIR  usrlocalssl CFLAGS  g Wall W IOPENSSLDIRinclude O2 DREENTRANT DEXTENSIONS   CFLAGS  g Wall W IOPENSSLDIRinclude O2  RPATH  ROPENSSLDIRlib LD  RPATH LOPENSSLDIRlib lssl lcrypto lsocket lnsl lpthread LD  LOPENSSLDIRlib lssl lcrypto lsocket lnsl pthread  OBJS  common.o  PROGS  server  all PROGS  server server.o OBJS         CC server.o OBJS o server LD   clean         RM PROGS .ln .BAK .bak .o codepre

Clicking either the Edit or View link takes you to a detail page with codelthpanelGridgtcode components inside codeltptabViewgtcode components. My detail page has two codeltptabViewgtcode components, one for editing, one for just viewing data. Which one you see depends on the codeltcifgtcode statements.  The button in the first codeltptabViewgtcode on the page by that I mean first working your way down from the top works as I would like it to, this happens to be the Edit component. The button in the other codeltptabViewgtcode does not work. I set up break points and went through the debugger, the second button doesnt seem to fire an ActionEvent regardless of what I try. Heres my code for the pagep  precode            ltuidefine namemetadatagt                 ltfmetadatagt                     ltfviewParam nameid valueuserDetailBean.selectedUserId gt

Negative 1608 pI am in the process of designing a survey system for our clients to report data to the central office.

These named conditionals can then be referenced by name in codeconditionalstatementcode in codeQuestioncode, using many codeNamedConditionalscode and logical operatiors. Then the flow for determining if a given question should be asked will go something like thisp  ol liFind all dependent codeNamedCondtionalscodeli liEvaluate all dependent codeNamedConditionalscodeli liUse the value of each codeNamedConditionalcode to evaluate codeconditionalstatementcode in codeQuestioncodeli ol  pMy question is in step 3, how expensive will it be to use codeevalcode to do the evaluation of conditionalstatement  I see the other option as parsing codeconditionalstatementcode into a expression tree when codeQuestioncode is saved, storing that in the database serialized, and then deserializing it when I need to evaluate it.p  pThere could be many 100 questions that this needs to happen for a given request.  Obviously I can cache and reuse the values of each codeNamedConditionalcode because each one will be used for multiple questions.  Is there a point where eval will perform better than an expression tree in this case  Or are both options garbagep

Negative 1608 pIm trying to set up a UITableView with elements layered like thisp  pimg srchttpcl.ly1i363F3H0R2x1R0l0k2msections.png altdiagramp  pSpecifically, the table has multiple sections and each section has a different background color. To do this I would normally just modify each cell. The tough part is that Id like the section headers to be translucent. When I do this, the background under the header is the table views background color when theres no cell under the header. I could of course set the table views background color, but then the color under each header would be the same.p  pHow would I create a table view like that depicted in the diagramp  pUPDATE To make it absolutely clear, I know how to make a custom header view, and know how to make it translucent using the alpha property. The problem is with what is UNDER the view. I need what is underneath to be the sections background color, not the table views background color.p

Negative 1608 pI have an asp.net web application. It communicates to business layer through WCF. There is a lengthy database operation taking two hours. This is a usual synchronous call.

I resolved this using WCF binding settings in both service and client.p  pNow, after exactly one hour, I am getting error in browser window. Even though our application has a custom application error page, it is not showing customized error.

Negative 1608 pIm having some issues using adobe air in conjunction with backbone. The problem is that in the beginning of my program, I specify a url for my Backbone.Controller which uses that to set the url attribute of my Collection. And when the program starts, Backbone uses that url, to get a response and calls the parse function in my collection, where I use that response and construct appropriate model from. The problem is that at the beginning, if I specify a relative path to the .xml file, it works, but if I specify a full path, it doesnt work, meaning that the response argument in the parse function for the collection is null. Here is some codep  precodeworks document.readyfunction    window.myApp  MyApp url  datafile.xml    .. var MyApp  Backbone.Controller.extends   setup routes   initialize functionopt    this.tree  new MyTree    this.tree.url  opt.url    ... var MyTree  Backbone.Collection.extends  model myTreeModel,  parse functionresponse  do stuff with response    codepre  pThe above works if I use relative path, but If I use full path like thisp  precodewindow.myApp  MyApp url  fileCUsersuserNameMyProjectdatafile.xml   codepre  pthe response sent to parse is undefined.

Negative 1608 pDear stackoverflowers,p  pIve implemented a routine to sort an xhtml table in place that is based on  more or less copied from Nicholas C. Zakas, Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, ch. 12. It works as advertised, but I have a few questions about how the code works and would be grateful for advice. Here are the relevant bitsp  precodevar oldTable  document.getElementByIdmyTable var oldTableBody  oldTable.tBodies[0] var oldTableRows  oldTableBody.rows var newTableArray  new Array for var i  0, rowCount  oldTableRows.length i lt rowCount i      newTableArray.pusholdTableRows[i]  newTableArray.sortchooseSort var newFragment  document.createDocumentFragment for var i  0, rowCount  newTableArray.length i lt rowCount i      newFragment.appendChildnewTableArray[i]  oldTableBody.appendChildnewFragment codepre  pI understand that Im adding pointers to the existing table rows when I push new values onto newTableArray, but Im not sure how the appendChild methods work. Specificallyp  ol lipWhen I append each of the array items pointers to the original rows to the document fragment, am I just adding a pointer leaving the row still in the original table, or am I removing the row object from the original table by appending it somewhere elsepli lipWhen I append newFragment to oldTableBody, if I understand correctly, Im actually appending not the fragment as an object, but the row objects that Ive appended to it, and thats just the way fragments work. Is that correctpli lipWhen I append newFragment to oldTableBody, I dont do anything explicit to remove the rows that were originally there. Where did they go Does appending them anew automatically remove any old traces of them because they can be attached only once If Im working with pointers, and not the objects themselves which I thought was what let me attach them to newTableArray without automatically making them disappear from the table, does this mean that I can have multiple pointers to the same object in some cases oldTable plus newTableArray but not others original rows in the original table plus the new, sorted rows that Im addingpli ol  pApologies for the naive questions, but although getting the results that I want is satisfying, not understanding how the code works makes me uneasy.p  pThanks,p  pDavidp

Theres also an aging factor, where more recent likes count more than ancient likes. p  pAll in all, its similar to the algorithm described a hrefhttpamix.dkblogpost19588 relnofollowherea.p  pMy problem is that I need to ensure diversity of the items in the result ranking. Each item belongs to a category. Certain categories may be disproportionately popular. I dont want to have all items in the front page or 2nd page to belong to Category A, while items from other categories are nowhere to be found.p  pSo are there any clever algorithm that can ensure diversity of results here  to make sure theres a nice mix of different categories in every pagep  pThanksp

Negative 1608 pIve just installed Blend 4 and are trying to use it with a rather big VS2010 project that includes a couple of CCLI assemblies with some native code. For a lot of controls I get a Blend error like The name XXX does not exist in the namespace clrnamespaceYYY when trying to open the design view.p  pIve searched the web including this forum for similar errors and have made sure that Ive followed all available suggestions, like e.g. making sure I have an AnyCPU configuration, that I dont use e.g. x64Debug as the output folder, and that I have the proper namespace declaration in my XAML using assembly in my clrnamespace declaration. p  pIve also made a simple, new project that only accesses one of the assemblies with the issue, but I still get the error.p  pIt looks to me that the issue is related to assemblies that references any of the CCLI assemblies that includes some unmanaged code. I do not seem to get the error for assemblies that references managedcodeonly assemblies.p  pWhat could cause the errors p  pRegards,p  pLeifp  hr  pLittle response here, so maybe I should rewrite my question a bitp  pHas anyone successfully used Expression Blend for a project that uses assemblies with unmanaged code p  pRegards, Leifp

Negative 1608 pMy programs architecture involves plugins dlls and the exe obviously.  We are the only plugin provider.  I was told that allocating memory in a plugin and then freeing it in the exe code was a potential problem if we statically linked the c runtime.  However, if we dynamically linked it, there was just one heap and the c runtime had access to all of it.  We switched to dynamic linking on the basis of this advice, but all weve emseenem from the switch is headaches and trouble related to distribution and installation of the new runtimes. Dont know what we emavoidedem in terms of memory allocation problems.p  pWhat are the memory allocation implications  Say a plugin allocates memory and the exe frees it.  Is there different behavior between the static vs dynamically linked c runtime  Will we have trouble statically linking the c runtime if we use plugins  If we switch back to static linking, will that mess up the memory leak detection and crash dump reporting p  pIs in line with some questions raised by comments on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1706762whichvcruntimeversiondoichoosestaticordynamicWhich VC runtime version do I choose  static or dynamica specifically a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1706762whichvcruntimeversiondoichoosestaticordynamic17076711707671Which VC runtime version do I choose  static or dynamicap  pThere is also some discussion at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryabx4dbyhvVS.100.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryabx4dbyhvVS.100.aspxa.  p

Negative 1608 pIm developing a 2D game on iOS, but Im finding it difficult getting drawing to run fast 60 FPS on Retina display.p  pIve first used UIKit for drawing, which is of course not suitable for a game. I coulndt draw a couple of sprites without slowdown.p  pThen I moved on to OpenGL, because I read its the closest I can get to the GPU which I think it means its the fastest possible. I was using glDrawArrays. When I ran it on the Simulator, FPS dropped when I was reaching over 200 triangles. People said it was because the Simulator or the computer are not optimized to run iOS OpenGL. Then I tested it on a real device, and to my surprise, the performance difference was really small. It still couldnt run that few triangles smoothly  and I know other games on iOS use a lot more polygons, shaders, 3D graphics, etc.p  pWhen I ran it through Instruments to check OpenGL performance, it told me I could speed it up by using VBOs. So I rewrote my code to use VBO instead, updating all vertices each frame. Performance increased very little, and I still cant surpass 200 triangles at consistent 60 FPS. And that is 2D drawing alone without context changestransformations. I also didnt write the game yet  there are no objects making no CPUintensive tasks.p  pEveryone I ask says OpenGL is top performance. What could I possibly be doing wrong I am assuming OpenGL can handle LOTS of polygons that are updated each frame  is that right Which method other games use that I see they run fine, like Infinity Blade which is 3D, or even Angry Birds which has lots of everupdating sprites What is recommended when making a gamep

Negative 1608 pIm fairly new to programming with Java... but this has really got me stumped, Ive searched for a while and I could not find a clear answer to what I was looking for... but lets say I have two methods p  precodepublic static void program1 String[] args      Integer intMoney     intMoney  500   public static void program2 String[] args      String strYes     strYes  JOptionPane.showInputDialogtype yes to subtract 100     ifstrYes.equalsYes  strYes.equalsyes      This is where I call the intMoney from program1   100     else         JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Thats not yes       codepre  pAnd here is where I get really stuck.. say I have another method like program1, But how can I call on the codeintMoneycode value in program1 in another methodp  pLets say I have a program and I want codeintMoneycode to be declared in a separate method so that when the Method program2 gets repeated the codeintMoneycode value wont change and it will be the same when the method is called on again.p
Negative 1608 pI am reading a document about C vs C. The document says C is tightly written when compared to C. One instance is, C allows codemaincode function type to be void. On the other hand C does not allow that and he gave the below statement from the standard. p  pIn the C Standardp  blockquote   pIt shall have a return type of int, but otherwise its type is implementationdefined. All implementations shall allow both of the following definitions of mainp  precodeint main      codepre      pandp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      codepre blockquote  pThe C standard says the same but has an additional statement. p  blockquote   pIf the return type is not compatible with int, the termination status returned to the host environment is unspecifiedp blockquote  pwhich indicates that allowing forms that do not return int is intentional.p  pWhen you have the statement type can be implementationdefined are you not allowing room for the C compiler implementation community to allow void as a typep

When the user changes the background preference the setting is saved and the background is updated using below codep  precodepublic static Bitmap setBackground int bgcolor         Bitmap.Config configBitmap.Config.ARGB8888      Bitmap bitmapBitmap.createBitmap2, 2, config     Canvas canvasnew Canvasbitmap      canvas.drawColorbgcolor     return bitmap       set background  if ExampleWidgetProvider.background1   views.setImageViewBitmapR.id.bgcolor, setBackgroundColor.parseColoraaaaaaaa else   views.setImageViewBitmapR.id.bgcolor, setBackgroundColor.parseColor00000000 codepre  pOne user reports that the background is changed back to transparent when he has set it to be semitransparent. This may happen seemingly random within a few minutes an hour or half a day.p  pI realised this is a problem with the background and not some kind of preference resetting because I sent the user a version of the appwidget that will always change the background to semitransparent, i.e. usingp  precode set background  if ExampleWidgetProvider.background1   views.setImageViewBitmapR.id.bgcolor, setBackgroundColor.parseColoraaaaaaaa else   views.setImageViewBitmapR.id.bgcolor, setBackgroundColor.parseColoraaaaaaaa codepre  pBut interestingly that didnt fix it. Since the default in the xml is set to transparent I am suspecting the app somehow is either restarted or redrawn and the default layout is being used.p  pHow can I detect andor work around thisp  pUpdate User as expected confirmed fix which permanently changes background colour in xml to semi transparent is working. Which means the system is resetting the background for some unknown reason.p  pThe user uses an LG PG 970 V. 2.2.2 and for what its worth he is using Juice Defender Ultimate and has it configured to not connect to the internet during the night.

Negative 1608 pI have a button on the site I am working on that uses a sprite sheet animation and so needs to be set as a background image. I require a regular click on the button to delay the redirect to another page by a fraction of a second for the animation to play, however I still wish for middle mouse clicks to function to open in new tab, without a delay.p  pCurrently I have this working in Javascript but it seems a pretty bad idea for everything to be handled that way and not to just have a href.p  pSo I have made thisp  precode    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      function delayed     window.stop     setTimeoutwindow.location  httpwww.dog.com, 800      ltscriptgt  lta hrefhttpwww.google.com onclickdelayedreturn falsegtI am a linkltagt codepre  pThe idea being that a regular click triggers the function and incurs a delay whereas a middle mouse click will just go straight to the href link.p  pThis works in Firefox. However in Chrome and Safari the middle click triggers the function and as a result opens the dog link in the same window on the finished version the links will be the same of course.p  pBasically all I need is a href that delays on click but still functions normally on middle click. My working solution uses Javascript to open in new tab on middle click but it strikes me that this may override browser settings and is probably a bad idea.p  pEDITp  pIn the meantime I had found this solution using Jqueryp  precodedocument.readyfunction        .delayed.clickfunction          var href  this.attrhref         setTimeoutfunction window.location  href, 800         return false       codepre  p...and the HTML    p  precodelta hrefhttpwww.google.com classdelayedgtltagt codepre  pThis worked but encountered the same problem with Chrome treating a middle click as a left click and hence opening it in the same window.p  pI have now modified it to include the content from sransara so that...

I have researched lots of documentation and tutorials, but there are some details i still havent catched up, and there is no information related to it. I hope somebody could help herep  pOne of my biggest issues are the VIEWS. I understand how you can build up your MVRC in your backbone.js app.js, your MVC on your Express.js app, how to persist on the backend express via JSON, using Socket.io for real time, etc. But, how do you design VIEWS p  pBoth frameworks offer their own VIEWS, but is obvious that if you are using Backbone.js, is because you want to build up the VIEWs on the client side HTML,CSS,jQuery and JS with Backbone, and not with Express Jade and templating. And if you use Express.js is because it offers more tools than Node.js, like authentication, session control, data base,etc.p  pHow do you mix it up i have seen some examples on internet like this book OReilly Mediap  pa hrefhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentals relnofollowhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentalsap  pspecifically, on their github source code related to option7 for a TodoList app.p  pHere, they mix up both technologies Backbone.js and Express.js with MongoDB. They do data persistant between client and server, connection to Redis, etc, Bbut i still dont understand why they use Jade and views for main HTML templating on Express.js, but CSS, jQuery and images inside public on Backbone.js.B p  pShouldnt we build up the HTML5,CSS3 and JS entirely in Backbone.js Whats the point of inyecting HTML templates from the backend through ROUTES, if you want all your MVC on the frontendp  pthank you very much and hope to get an answer p

Negative 1608 pIs it possible to convert a pointer to certain value to a slicep  pFor example, I want to read single byte from codeio.Readercode into codeuint8code variable. codeio.Reader.Readcode accepts a slice as its argument, so I cannot simply provide it a pointer to my variable as Id do in C.p  pI think that creating a slice of length 1, capacity 1 from a pointer is safe operation. Obviously, it should be the same as creating a slice from an array of length 1, which is allowed operation. Is there an easy way to do this with plain variable Or maybe I do not understand something and there are reasons why this is prohibitedp

This is because the edittext objects are unavailable to set the values. p  pSuppose if I dont set any initial values in the edittexts and continue with my app. The same problem repeats while setting the values back in the edittexts which are entered in previous mode after changing the orientation.

Negative 1608 pIm new to Git or anything about version control. Heres our setup As a developer I have a local installation of Wordpress which is a clone from our master branch in github called master. Each time I make changes, I push them including the mysql dump to master branch. Another developer also has another remote branch based on master. The problem is as we make changes on our own branch, the database change as well. Our routine when it comes to database is, we manually import the mysql dump into whichever database we chose to be overridden. This is very tedious because we have to manually checkcompare changes in the databases which in turn slow down the development. So the question is, does Git allow merging of mysql dumps just like how it does with regular files If not, could you please give me an alternative solution in merging msyql dumps Or are there ways that would allow us to avoid it completely Forgive me if Im not using the terms correctly.p

Negative 1608 pby default, the password stored in a codePasswordBoxcode is hidden behind a masking character. This can be changed from the default, a caret, to another character using codePasswordBox.PasswordCharcode. p  pMy question is this Is there a way to remove the masking function altogether, in other words make the password visiblep  pObviously your first thought might be to use a plain text entry field, however, the user has the ability to show or hide repeatedly, at will. While using this solution I could replace the password with carets and store the real password in a variable, and then replace it with the real password again if the user wants it visible, I dont like the idea because it makes for a lot of somewhat messy code.p  pAny ideas would be much appreciated.

Negative 1608 pThe question is basically selfexplanatory.  I havent been able to find an API for arrays other than this a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilArrays.htmlArraysa, but this just defines a bunch of static helper functions for dealing with actual arrays.  If there is no class for it, this seems to suggest that an array cant be an codeObjectcode.p  pHowever, the fact that an array has public fields like codelengthcode and methods that it can invoke like code.equalscode and code.clonecode seem to suggest very strongly the complete opposite.p  pWhat is the explanation for the odd presentation and behavior of primitive arraysp  pAs a note, I tried to use the Open Implementation Eclipse feature on the code.clonecode method of an array just now, hoping that I would be able to look at where and how this method was defined since it said int[] overrode it from Object, but it actually caused my entire Eclipse to freeze up and crash...p

In particular I am trying to achieve a more orange color for my particles but whatever I try the particles are always a yellowish color.p  pIn particular whenever I increase the starting Red value or the particle animation, I see no changes in the Red color of the animation in Cocos2D. I must also note I did not have this issue in Cocos2D 1.x so something must have broke. Could it have done with this pull request a hrefhttpsgithub.comcocos2dcocos2diphonepull205 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcocos2dcocos2diphonepull205ap  pIs there some certain source and destination blending function I am supposed to use with Cocos2D 2.x to get the results I see in Particle Designers simulatorp  pThanksp

Lets say I have the following article codeNeque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consecteturcode and translations of it in the languages I will use on my web site. The words codequisquamcode, codedoloremcode, codeconsecteturcode represent links. I would like to echo the whole article in my view script, with the code codeecho thisgttranslategtsomeArticlecode.

Is it possible to somehow scan a view script for those words that represent links, to be displayed as such using url declared for example in the respective controller Or do I have to translate by pieces before and after words that are links Thank You.p

This application is only used to respond strongLONG RUNNING REQUESTSstrong i.e. serving big files, please dont advise using XSendfileXAccelRedirect because the response is generated dynamically from Python app.p  pWith Gunicorn sync workers, when we run 8 workers only 8 request is served simulatenously. Since all of these responses are IO bound, we want to switch to asyncronous worker type to get better throughput.p  pWe have switched the worker type from sync to eventlet in Gunicorn configuration file. Now we can respond all of the requests simultaneously but another mysterious mysterious to me problem has occured.p  pIn the application we have a scoped session object in module level. Following code is from our orm.py filep  precodeuri  mysqlsssscharsetutf8ampuseunicode1       config.MYSQLUSER,     config.MYSQLPASSWD,     config.MYSQLHOST,     config.MYSQLDB,   engine  createengineuri, echoFalse  session  scopedsessionsessionmaker     autocommitFalse,     autoflushFalse,     bindengine,     queryclsCustomQuery,     expireoncommitFalse      codepre  pOur application uses the session like thisp  precodefrom putio.models import session  f  session.queryFile.first f.name  asdf session.addf session.commit codepre  pWhile we using sync worker, session was used from 1 request at a time. After we have switched to async eventlet worker, all requests in the same worker share the same session which is not desired. When the session is commited in one request, or an exception is happened, all other requests fail because the session is shared.p  pIn documents of SQLAlchemy, said that scopedsession is used for seperated sessions in threaded environments.

I also worry about the efficiency of calling reloadData every .5 seconds.p  pIs there a smoother way to get that image blinking  I was thinking of saving a pointer to any blinking cells, and update the .image property in the timer.  But this seems like a bad idea, since cells are reused for different rows of the table ouch, and I doubt that simply updating the .image property would update the table without a reloadData.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1608 pI am facing some trouble processing large buffers. Since I was testing my code only on quite small buffers not larger than codePAGESIZEcode, I have not met this before. The code is simply about ciphering or deciphering a buffer.p  pCurrently, the code just sets one codescatterlistcode object with the codesgsetbufcode call for the source and the destination buffers. But it appears that, when doing things this simple, the encryption does not occur if the buffer size exceeds codePAGESIZEcode.p  pObviously, I can bypass the problem by allocating a smaller buffer, that fits in a single page and processing the larger buffer progressively with appropriate codememcpycode calls. But since this is ugly, time and resource consuming ...p  pI was wondering if there was a way to handle nicely the codescatterlistcode objects for this kind of buffers p  pstrongEDITstrong  I forgot to say I already went through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13376825linuxkernelscatterlistmaximumlengthallowedthis questiona.p  hr  pstrongOther EDITstrong  In fact, I have quite the same issue as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13376825linuxkernelscatterlistmaximumlengthalloweduser173586a.

Negative 1608 pIm working with a WIX installer and keep getting this error messagep  blockquote   pstrongWIX Error 1723strong. There is a problem with this Windows Installer   package. A DLL required for this install to complete could not be run.p blockquote  pAre there any other issues that would cause the 1723 error which are not related to the DLL not being foundp  pI can say with 100 certainty that the DLL has to be found because previous custom actions in the same installer work and they all use the same DLL.p  pI had this error before and solved it by renaming the custom action so I assumed it was related to the length of the name allowed for the custom action. This time I have tried both a shorter name and a name the exact length of other working custom actions and still get this error.p  pI have investigated causes of 1723 and the most common one seems to be that the installer fails to unpack the DLL due to access rights. Although this is very unlikely as other custom actions in the same file referencing the same DLL work fine I have ensured that the folder the installer is trying to access has full access for this user, also I am running the installer from a command prompt in administrator mode so we should have no issues there.  p
Negative 1608 pI am trying to use the Kendo UI Grid to display and edit a multivalued property. I am not using the Jsp or the ASP.NET wrapper to do so. I am facing a couple of problems with this.

Also, how do I use a select box as the editor and bind it to the data already selectedp
Negative 1608 pI just need and idea to resolve this situation We made a Swing application to capture data over a serial port, this capture fires some alarms rendered in a JPane and at the same time this info is stored in a database to supply some statisticals using JFreechart and JasperReports.

Negative 1608 h2A bit of backgroundh2  pI am currently working on an assignment from my OOP course which consists in designing and implementing a phone book manager around various design patterns.p  pIn my project there are 3 classes around which all the action happens p  ul licodePhoneBookcodeli licodeContactcode        the types stored in the phone bookli licodeContactFieldcode   fields stored in the codeContactcode.li ul  pcodeContactManagercode must provide a way to iterate over its contacts in 2 modes unfiltered and filtered based on a predicate codeContactcode must provide a way to iterate over its fields.p  h2How I initially decided to implementh2  pAll design patterns books I came across recommend coding to an interface so my first thought was to extract an interface from each of the above classes and then make them implement it.p  pNow I also have to create some kind of polymorphic iterator for things to be smooth so I adapted the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilIterator.html relnofollowJava iterator interfacea to write forward iterators.p  h2The problemsh2  ul lipThe major setback with this design is that I lose interoperability with stl codeltalgorithmgtcode and the syntactic sugar offered by range based for loops.pli lipAnother issue I came across is the codeIteratorltTgtremovecode function. If I want an iterator that can alter the sequence it iterates over remove elements then all is fine however if I dont want that behavior Im not exactly sure what to do.p  pI see that in Java    one can throw codeUnsupportedOperationExceptioncode which isnt that bad    since correct me if Im wrong if an exception isnt handled then    the application is terminated and a stack trace is shown. In C you    dont really have that luxury unless you run with a debugger    attached I think and to be honest Id rather prefer to catch such    errors at compile time.pli ul  hr  pThe easiest way out that I see of this mess is to avoid using interfaces on the iterable types in order to accommodate my own stl compatible iterators. This will increase coupling however Im not sure it will actually have any impact in the long run not in the sense that this project will become throw away code soon of course. My guess is that it wont however, Id like to hear the elders opinion as well before I proceed with my design.p

Negative 1608 pI started using symfony2 and doctrine not long ago. I have two classes subclass and parent class with a JOINED inheritance type. The connection seems to work fine but if I run codedoctrinegenerateentitiescode on the subclass then Doctrine adds all of the parent class methods and properties to it. Moreover, they are all declared as codeprivatecode, despite them being codeprotectedcode in the parent class.p  pI do not want to add all that stuff to the subclass for a few reasons. Mainlyp  ul lidoctrine itself complains about this setup, saying that the protected symbols cannot be redeclared as private. This prevents the generation of the SQL. liI am likely to need to change some of those methods in the parent class and do want the modifications to carry over to the subclass.li ul  pSo the questions arep  ol liIs this behavior normal or is it because of a mistake that I have madeli liHow do I stop doctrine to do that I could just not run doctrinegenerateentities again on that class but I do appreciate the other stuff it does.li liIs this a design pattern that I am not aware of If so I am very curious about what it is good for and would be delighted to know more about it.li ol  pThanks to everybodyp

Everytime we done something, we have to manually replicate everything back to trunk Yes, manually redo linebyline into the trunk code. p  pIm not sure how everyone else do it with SVN, but apparently, this seems so wrong for me. p  pThere got to be a better way of doing this, SVN merging for example although I dont really understand how SVN merge the code and resolving conflicts etcp  pCan someone shed some light pleasep
Negative 1608 pSo I have a project that I think is simple enough to learn with, but complex enough to be interesting that I would like to write using the Happstack library.  At its most fundamental level, this project would just be a fancy file server with some domainspecific REST methods or whatever, I dont really care if its truly RESTful or not for searching and getting said files and metadata.  Since Im also trying to really learn monad transformers right now, I decided this would be the perfect project to learn with.  However, Im running into some difficulties getting it started, particularly with how to construct my transformer stack.p  pRight now, Im only worried about a few things config, error reporting, and state, and logging, so I started withp  precodenewtype MyApp a  MyApp      runMyApp  ReaderT Config ErrorT String StateT AppState IO a  deriving ... codepre  pSince Im always going to be in IO, I can really easily use hslogger with this to take care of my logging.  But I also knew I needed to use codeServerPartTcode in order to interact with Happstack, thusp  precoderunMyApp  ReaderT Config ErrorT String StateT AppState ServerPartT IO a codepre  pI can get this to run, see requests, etc, but the problem Ive run into is that this needs codeFilterMonadcode implemented for it in order to use methods like codedircode, codepathcode, and codeokcode, but I have no idea how to implement it for this type.  I just need it to pass the filters down to the underlying monad.  Can someone give me some pointers on how to get this obviously crucial type class implemented  Or, if Im just doing something terribly wrong, just steer me in the right direction.  Ive only been looking at Happstack for a few days, and transformers are still quite new to me.  I think I understand them enough to be dangerous, but I dont know enough about them that I could implement one on my own.  Any help you can provide is greatly appreciatedp  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.combheklilr5873764 relnofollowFULL CODEap  pXposted from a hrefhttpwww.reddit.comrhaskellcomments1h5ndrbeginnerlearninghappstackandmonadtransformers relnofollowrhaskellap

Negative 1608 pI have a location list and want to compare each location with the others to eliminate close locations. Here, the close means is that 20km.

For example, codelocationlist[A,B,C,D,E,F]code, the first comparison pairs would be codeA,Bcode and distance between them is 25km. So, it is greater than threshold, we can add codeA,Bcode to result list. The second comparison would be codeA,Ccode and distance between them is 50km that is greater than threshold, here i should compare C with A and B which are previously added to result list. If the distance between codeB,Ccode is greater than threshold, i should add codeCcode to the result list, otherwise C should not be added to the list, because it is close to the previously added locations.p  pThe point i got stuck is this, how can I compare the new location codee.g., Ccode with codeA,Bcode which are added to the list in previous step.p  precodefrom math import radians, cos, sin, asin, sqrt  def haversinelon1, lat1, lon2, lat2       convert decimal degrees to radians     lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2  mapradians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2]      haversine formula     dlon  lon2  lon1     dlat  lat2  lat1     a  sindlat22  coslat1  coslat2  sindlon22     c  2  asinsqrta     km  6367  c     return km   result[] locationlist[44.968046,94.420307,                 44.33328,89.132008,                 33.755787,116.359998,                 33.844843,116.54911,                 44.92057,93.44786,                 44.240309,91.493619,                 44.968041,94.419696,                 44.333304,89.132027,                 33.755783,116.360066,                 33.844847,116.549069,                 44.920474,93.447851,                 44.240304,91.493768]   for j in locationlist     for k in locationlist         if haversinej[0],j[1],k[0],k[1]gt20             print j,k,haversinej[0],j[1],k[0],k[1]             result.appendj[0],j[1]             result.appendk[0],k[1] codepre

It seems an undue burden to expect all descendant classes to know what the ancestor classes are naming their private messagehandling methods and vv for any ancestor class to know what all of its descendant classes are naming their private methods  indeed, in our case, it was the ancestor class that added message handling for the specific event and with the specific method name after the descendant class had been doing so.  p

Negative 1608 pI am having a difficult time understanding how to implement AVRCP with my project. I have searched quite a bit and read many datasheets, but I still seem to be missing something...p  pHere is what I want to dop  pSimply put, i want to be able to connect with my android 4.3 device via bluetooth to stream music via A2DP which seems pretty straight forward as long as the bluetooth module supports A2DP. Additionally, i want to be able to control the media player app Pandora, etc. Now, i know that AVRCP 1.0 supports only basic control commands pause, play, next, prev, FF, RW, and I have found many bluetooth modules online that support sending these commands via simple UART AT commands or commands via an SPI bus. However, I also want to be able to get metadata from the android device which is an AVRCP 1.3 only capability, such as track name, album name, artist name, track length, and elapsed time.p  pNow, from what I understand, to get metadata, I need a bluetooth module that supports AVRCP 1.3 or higher. What I cannot understand is HOW one requests the metadata From what I read, metadata, such as track name, artist, ablum, and track length, are are sent in response to a track change command. Can anyone confirm this What about if I need to request the elapsed timep  pIdeally, I am looking for a bluetooth module that support A2DP 24 bit if available and AVRCP 1.3 or higher with a UART or SPI or I2C interface where I can send it play, pause, next, prev commands to control the music player and request artist, album, track name, elapsed time, track length metadata.p  pThis is the only unit that I have found that mentions metadata in the datasheet a hrefhttpdlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.netdatasheetsWirelessBluetoothMelody5.0ManualRevDRC10Release.pdf relnofollowhttpdlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.netdatasheetsWirelessBluetoothMelody5.0ManualRevDRC10Release.pdfa pg.16p  pBut I am still unclear how this worksp  pAny assistance here would be greatp

Its a test process isnt it Im sure when developing antimalware software, they need some sort of testing process to see how well hishertheir software copes with the real malware. And when developing a software, dont developers or testers attempt to break and exploit software to see its weakness, and how well it performs, to evaluate its capability, attribution, and etcp

Ive tried dismissViewController, but codeAcode will show the state that before presented codeBcode, maybe some subviewcontrollers of codeAcode. p  pSo I would like to present the initial controller instead of dismiss the current one.p  ol lipI think this may cause potential memory issue since I just put a view controller on top of stack and the reset of them never deleted rightpli lipIf there is a memory issue, is there a better way to do it The complicated way is use delegate, while logout, manually reset the initial view controllerpli ol  pThanksp
Negative 1608 pSome backgroundp  pI am writing a parser to retrieve information from sites with a markup language. Standard libraries as wikitools, ... do not work for me as I need to be more specific and adapting them to my needs puts a layer of complexity between me and the problem. Python  simple regex got me into difficulties identifying the dependencies between the different tokens in the markup language in a transparent manner  so obviously I needed to arrive at PLY at the end of this journey.p  pNow it seems that PLY identifies the tokens via regex differently compared to Python  but I cant find something on it. I dont want to move on in case I dont understand how PLY determines the tokens within its lexer as otherwise I would have no control of the logic I am depending on and will fail in a later stage.p  pHere we gop  precodeimport ply.lex as lex  text  r 123456  token1  r .  tokens      TEST,  tTEST  token1  lexer  lex.lexreflagsre.UNICODE, debug1 lexer.inputtext for tok in lexer     print tok.type, tok.value, tok.lineno, tok.lexpos codepre  presults inp  precodelex tokens    TEST, lex literals   lex states    INITIAL inclusive lex Adding rule tTEST gt  .  state INITIAL lex  MASTER REGEXS FOLLOW  lex state INITIAL  regex[0]  PlttTESTgt .  TEST  123456  1 0 codepre  pThe last line is surprising  I would have expected the first and the last codecode to be missing in code 123456 code in case it is comparable to search and nothing in case it is comparable to match. Obviously this is important as then codecode cannot be distinguished from codecode or codecode from codecode, i.e. headlines, enumbering, ... cannot be differentiated.p  pSo why does PLY behaves differently for standard Pythonregex and how  couldnt find something in the documentation, or here at stackoverflow.p  pI would guess it is more my understanding of PLY as the tool is around for quite some time already, i.e. this behavior is in there by intention I would guess. The only somehow related information I could find deals with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7451821plylexmatchregularexpressionhasdifferentgroupsthanausualrerq1different groupsa but does not explain a different behavior of identifying regexes itself. I found nothing in plyhack as well. p  pAm I overlooking something stupid simplep  pFor comparison purposes here standard Python  regexp  precodeimport re  text  r 123456  token1  r .   p  re.compiletoken1  m  p.searchtext if m     print Match found , m.group else     print No match  m  p.matchtext if m     print Match found , m.group else     print No match codepre  pgivesp  precodeMatch found   123456  No match codepre  pas expected, first is the result of search, second of matchp  pMy settings I am working with spyder  this is the terminal display at startp  precodePython 2.7.5 default, Sep 19 2013, 134951  [GCC 4.8.1] on linux2 Type help, copyright, credits or license for more information.

I runp  precodegit init ampamp git add . ampamp git commit m hello world  eb init codepre  pI run through the necessary steps, Ive tried creating a 32 and 64 bit ubuntu instances with ruby 1.9.3 Which is what my local environment is set up as, I dont set up RDS, and then runp  precodeeb start codepre  pwhich prompts me to deploy my latest git commit, I say yes, and it deploysp  pGood news Not so much, Yes my url given by EB does say Hello World, but if at ANY point I try to deploy new code, lets say a change to the gemfile, and there is an error in building my gemfile.. the environment completely blocks me out to the point where.p  ul liI cannot access any logs, and If I try, the env goes into a grey state, and rebootsli liI cannot redeploy any previous git commit, the env just spends 10 minutes and times outli ul  pIm getting frustrated having to rebuild an ENTIRE environment every time there is a slight error in the code.p  pIn general, Im looking for an alternative to heroku, from which I can deploy changes from the command line. I dont think my question is phrased well enough for anyone to spot out exactly what Im doing wrong  If I am even doing something wrong. If there are any bestpractices with deploying to EB.. please let me know. Thanksp
Negative 1608 pI have a web form which when loading the form on PageLoad, the text value of a textbox is prefilled with a value from a database.

Negative 1608 pI need to create a database which allow for easy manual entry of data as well as linking to SQL databases I have access to. This is something Ive been researching and trying to design by myself for a while now. Everytime I think I have a solution I begin to have doubts that this is the right direction. I would really REALLY appreciate your helpinput.p  pstrongMy current workflow and nightmare.strongbr I work in IT and Im responsible for reporting for my own group but it has been and will continue to expand across many groups across the whole IT organization. Each group has their own reporting tool with some that can export data cleanlyconsistently, others that have to input data manually and a few which I can access the SQL database directly but havent yet.p  pTo create a monthly report I have a master workbook with graphs that reference data in multiple data collection workbooks. In these data collection workbooks I have the raw data which either myself or the teamservice owners inputs each month. From that raw data I may create a pivot table to get the data I want and then in each one of the collection workbooks I have a reference tab. In this reference tab I have a formula that is a rolling 13 months in the first column which say goes from Jan 2013 to Jan 2014. The months are calculated by referencing a cell that has the current reporting month in it. So for this example its Jan 2014. When you change that cell to the next month say Feb 2014 it will roll that first column so that those same cells now go from Feb 2013 to Jan 2014. the columns to the right of this column reference either the data table directly or the pivot tables using vlookups or getpivotdata formulas that reference the month cell to the left and grabs data accordingly. a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu14628356NETWORKDATA.xlsx relnofollowHere is an example of a collection workbook.ap  pAs you can see this can be a very manual and tedious workflow with many points where this could be improved. One major issue is the fact that each teamgroup doesnt pull data from the same tool and doesnt serve it up in the right format. I sometimes have to write a vba script to take the raw data and add helper data like a column with the correctly formatted 02012014 format so it works in pivot tables correctly instead of multiple entries with different days ie. 02052014 02232014.p  pstrongThe end goal  where I want to bestrongbr I want to create a database where I can link SQL databases directly to it as well as making it easy for a team to manually input data by reading in a csv or xls file of data. The crux again is that Im only one person and I want to offload as much as the data entry to each one of those teamsgroups without making it a difficult task.p  pUsing the master sheet to create a monthly report has some great results but I would like this to be a web accessible and dynamic dashboard. Im a pretty good front end dev with knowledge of HTML, CSSLESS and some JSSQL knowledge. I will have support of a senior web developer if I can proceed with this project. I just need help in working out the data collectionstoragequerying portion of this.p  pIf you got this far thank you so much for reading about my problem. If I wasnt clear about something or you have more questions for me please feel free to ask.p  pTHANKSp

Negative 1608 pstrongHow do you update RESTful resources in a web API from the client, when you also need the backend to take actions regarding these changesstrongp  pLets say I have a RESTful web API with the following resourcesp  ul liWorker  id, firstname, lastname, ...li liProject  id, title, duedate, ..., worker [ref to Worker]. A project can exist only if it belongs to a worker.li ul  pIn the client which is typically a mobile app, users can retrieve a list of some workers projects. They can then modify each project in that list update, delete, or create new ones. Changes must take place locally on the client side, until a send command is dispatched, only then the server should receive the updates. Kind of like a classic form use case.p  pstrongThe tricky partstrong I need the backend to take actions according to each change, both individually and also as a whole. For examplep  ol liA user retrieved some workers projects list, deleted a project, and also updated the duedate of another.li liAccording to this change, the backend needs to both send push notifications to all of that projects members, and also recalculate the relevant workers priorities according the total change in their projects one was deleted, another got postponed....li ol  pHow do I achieve this in the best wayp  ul liIf I updatedeletecreate each project by itself with seperate POSTs, PUTs and DELETEs, when will the backend do the overall recalculation taskli liIf I update them all together as a bulk with PUT, the backend will then need to understand what exactly changed which got deleted, which modified..., which is a hard chore.li liAnother option I heard is to create a third utility resource, thats something like WorkerProjectUpdater that holds the changes that need to be made, like transactions, and then have a daemon going through it and actually committing the changes. This is also hard to achieve as in the real story there are many many types of modifications, and itll be quite complex to create a resource with a model and DB records for every type of change.li ul  pIm using a hrefhttpswww.djangoproject.com relnofollowDjangoa with a hrefhttpwww.djangorestframework.org relnofollowDjango Rest Frameworka for that web service.p  pAppreciate your helpp

Negative 1608 pSOLVED  I Found my error... I posted my solution at the end.  Sorry for wasting time.p  pIt has been a while since I have played with c.  It has never been my primary language, so I am not familiar with the finer details.  I am having a weird bug pop up.  When I call factorize, it is resetting the sign of the number.  This is despite the fact that sign is never touched.p  pI have found a work around. In my working code, Ive added an integer to preserve and reset the value, but I dont think I should have to.  I removed those two lines from the code sample below.p  pPlaces I reset sign sign is set to 0 by the constructor of this class. It can be set to 0 in the  and  operators if they each have the same sign.  It is set to zero by the  operator only if assigning a unsigned long long value to the object it preserves the sign if setting it equal to another FactorNumber.p  pAnd thats it.  Those are the only places that I am setting sign to zero.  I dont see why any of those would be called by this function.  But, I am not really attuned to the finer points of how c does things when working with classes.  I cant see why sign keeps getting reset to 0, but maybe I am doing something wrong.  Does anyone see why it is happeningp  precodeclass FactorNumber      private         unsigned long long number         unsigned long long factorlist[63]      this is the max possible amount         int numberoffactors         int sign                                0positive 1negative         void factorize [snipped irrelevant public function calls]       void FactorNumberfactorize      int x0     forx0xlt64x          factorlist[x]0          numberoffactors0     unsigned long long currentfactor2     64 bits in c     unsigned long long currentnumbernumber     unsigned long maxfactor0   can never be more than 32 bits     if numbergt3          maxfactorsqrtcurrentnumber         while currentfactorltmaxfactor              ifcurrentnumbercurrentfactor                  ifcurrentfactorgt2                      currentfactor2                  else                      currentfactor3                                  else                  factorlist[numberoffactors]currentfactor                 currentnumbercurrentnumbercurrentfactor                 ifcurrentnumbercurrentfactor                      maxfactorsqrtcurrentnumber                                                  If there is a number larger than one, add it to the array.         ifcurrentnumbergt1              factorlist[numberoffactors]currentnumber          else              numberoffactors         If not, we ignore this last number               else          numberoffactors0         factorlist[0]number       codepre  pMy error was an obiwan error.  I was writing past the end of my array factorlist[63] does not actually exist and that was overwriting my data.  It is just coincidence that this reset sign and didnt screw up other stuff or maybe it does but I didnt catch it yet.   This is why I asked the question.  It wasnt that I couldnt work around it, I knew there was a bug somewhere in my code.p  pChanging the for loop condition to xlt63 cleared the bug up.p

Negative 1608 pI have been experimenting with SpriteKit for some time now, and I would appreciate some best practice input regarding the movement of my SKSpriteNode within its SKScenes bounds.p  pUsing the accelerometer, I am applying forces on an SKSpriteNodes PhysicsBody property in order to move the node around the screen in a marblelike fashion.

Negative 1608 pThis is something Ive been having issues recently. Sometimes after I exit the app using home button and let it sit idly in the background for a while, I get null pointer for getActivity. So Im just wondering if Im setting up async task and listeners wrong or perhaps the issue lies elsewhere. My general procedure is as followsp  precodepublic class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, ListltSomeObjectgtgt      private Context ctx     private AsyncListener listener      public MyAsyncTaskContext ctx     set Context, etc        ...     onPostExecuteListltSomeObjectgt result         super.onPostExecuteresult         ifresultnull             listener.onAvailableresult          else              listener.onUnavailable                    public interface AsyncListener         void onAvailableListltSomeObjectgt result         void onUnavailable           public void setAsyncListenerAsyncListener listener         this.listener  listener       codepre  pFragmentp  precodepublic class MyFragment extends Fragment implements AsyncListener       private AsyncTask task     private ListltSomeObjectgt data      Override     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,         Bundle savedInstanceState           TODO Autogenerated method stub         return inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentmessages, container, false           Override     public void onActivityCreatedBundle savedInstanceState           TODO Autogenerated method stub         super.onActivityCreatedsavedInstanceState          setViews         ifdata  null              task  new AsyncTaskgetActivity             task.setAsyncListenerthis             task.execute          else              setData                    private void setData          someListView.setAdapternew SomeAdaptergetActivity, data           Override     public void onAvailableListltSomeObjectgt result         this.data  result         setData           Override     public void onUnavailableListltSomeObjectgt result         Create toast or alert dialog, etc       codepre  pAs you can see, I use listeners to post result from asynctask to my fragment. Problem is, I sometimes receive null pointer on getActivity when setting adapter. This only happens if I exit application, let it sit in the background for extended period of time and then open it. Perhaps listener gets triggered before Fragment is attached Perhaps I need to set my logic in a different wayp

Negative 1608 pI have made a site that loads data from a file a time value, then starts a Javascript timer. I would then like to use php to add the time recorded on to the loaded time, so you effectively have an incremental timer that carries on from the last time I visited. This saving of the new time value could be done by a Javascript function feeding into PHP I assume this needs AJAX, and I havent figured out how to get that to work, or by going to a new PHP page with all the saving instructions there, but in this case how do I carry over the data from the Javascript timer Are there any other methods to do this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1608 pSo I had set up a settings bundle to just do one thing. Allow the Users to choose between the The TouchUI and GestureUI in my app and for some odd reason, I am unable to get the Settings Bundle to control it. It stays with one and doesnt switch even when I have the If else Statement. originally I had codevar touchCheck  userDefaults.boolForKeymyGestureEnabledDisabledcode but it didnt change boolean at all when i keep  closing appMultitask  SwipeUp app and re running the app via springboard. The Settings App could have the bundle at codeNOcode but log says gestures are on. After watching a Tutorial, i changed codeboolForKeycode to codevalueForKeycode which causes the build to fail and there is no error in the code the way i have it below.p  precode    override func viewDidLoad      var userDefaults  NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults     userDefaults.synchronize     var touchCheck  BooluserDefaults.valueForKeymyGestureEnabledDisabled      if touchCheck           whenGuestureIsEnabled       else           whenGestureIsDisabled         self.navBar.hidden  false         func whenGuestureIsEnabled       NSLogGesture is suppose to be on   func whenGestureIsDisabled       NSLogGesture is OFF   codepre  pMaybe from what I was thinking, I shouldnt do this in UIViewController but I had seen this in action in a youtube tutorial and it was in OBJC. p

Negative 1608 pis it possible in JSF facelets to do a conditional codeuiincludecode and preserve the layout of the parent the including xhtmlp  pExample I have a form which has always some basic attributes rendered in a panelgrid with 4 columns label, input, label input. Now I have some type specific form input elements. For each type specific form part I created a separate xhtml. For this the specific attributes have to be conditionally included after the basic attributes. Unfortunately the codeuiincludecode has no coderenderedcode attribute. So I have to wrap something around the codeuiincludecode. This unfortunately overrides my layout set by the including parent which defines 4 columns. I want to render the specific attributes in this 4 column panelGrid without starting a new layout element which is vanishing my layout. Is there a possibility in JSF to achieve thisp  pRegards Oliverp

Negative 1608 pIm trying to enable push notifications through parse.

Because there isnt a currentUser logged in, when the app tries creating a PFInstallation, all of the associating fields are returning nil. I have tried an if statement checking for a currentUser before running the PFInstallation code, but the app still crashes.

Negative 1608 pMy question is about Hibernate and whether its suited to the use case I need, but it requires a bit of background knowledge which is also provided in case anyone knows of a different solution to this use case. Im working on a substantial codebase upgrade, taking an old HTTP only PHP custom web API and creating a new, TCPHTTP, much improved, and more modular version of it using Scala and OSGi.p  pIm at the stage of planning the data persistence layer and part of the problem that I face is that the old production database which has a great deal of customer data contained within it was very poorly designed, quite rigid and with large tables favoured over smaller tables with references which presents a bit of a problem unique to Scalas case classes which are allowed only a maximum of 22 fields, some tables exceed that. Currently any changes to the database schema which happen somewhat regularly require taking down the whole application while they are applied.p  pFrom the beginning of this project, creating a system that allows much cleaner and less disruptive schema refactorings to happen has been one of the forefront goals. To achieve this goal, the plan is to utilize a sort of branchbyabstraction model on schema and prefer ADDing schema instead of ALTERing it.p  pAn example of this in the wild would be Etsy, who describe it fairly succinctly in the slide show here a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netmikebrittaincontinuousdeliverythedirtydetails relnofollowhttpwww.slideshare.netmikebrittaincontinuousdeliverythedirtydetailsap  pThe basic steps though arep  ol liAdd new tableli liSet config flag to write model to both old and new tablesli liBackfill old data in new table as an offline proccessli liGradually increase reading from new table e.g. staff only  1 of users  5  100li liSwitch off writing to old table and removeli ol  pIn order for something like this to work an incode model must be able to be written to both the old table and the new table. While multiple model versions is a possibility as well as something that OSGi makes a lot simpler, this creates issues with synchronization between an old version model instance and the new version model instance, therefore my preference would be to maintain a single version of the model in code at any one time.p  pMy question now is whether it is possible in Hibernate to define a model with multiple mappings, one for the old schema and one for the new schema. As well as the ability to select which mapping is read from and which or both is written to.p

Also Im using bootstrap 3.0 I dont know if that is a problem. p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefltuplevelgtassetscssbootstrap.cssgt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefltuplevelgtassetsvideojsvideojs.cssgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt     ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcollg4 collgoffset2gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcollg4gt                 ltvideo idintrovideo classvideojs vjsdefaultskin preloadauto width640 height264 poster datasetupcontrolstrue gt                 ltsource srchttptechslides.comdemossamplevideossmall.mp4 typevideomp4 gt                 ltvideogt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcltuplevelgtassetsjsbootstrap.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcltuplevelgtassetsvideojsvideo.jsgtltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pfor other references the    p  precodeltuplevelgt codepre  pis just a directory level calculator. There is no problem with that function. Also I have double and triple checked the videojs folder is in its proper directory location, and is loading. So again just to recap, using the video.js extension, it isnt letting me style anything, or overwrite the normal html5 styles. How do I fix thisp

Negative 1608 pI hope answering my question would not require a lot of time, because it is about my understanding of this topic.p  pSo, the question is about block and grid sizes for concurrent kernels execution.p  pFirst, let me tell about my card it is GeForce GTX TITAN, and here is some of its characteristics, which I think are important in this question.p  pCUDA Capability MajorMinor version number    3.5p  pTotal amount of global memory                 6144 MBytes 6442123264 bytesp  p14 Multiprocessors, 192 CUDA CoresMP     2688 CUDA Coresp  pWarp size                                     32p  pMaximum number of threads per multiprocessor  2048p  pMaximum number of threads per block           1024p  pNow, the main problem I have a kernelit performs sparse matrix multiplication, but it is not so important and I want to launch it simultaneously in several streams on one GPU, computing different matrixes multiplication. Please, notice again the simultaneous requirement  I want all the kernels start at one moment, and finish at the anotherall of them, so the solution when these kernels only partly overlap doesnt satisfy me. It is also very important that I want to maximize the number of parallel kernels, even if we lose some performance because of it.p  pOk, lets consider we already have the kernel and we want to specify its grid and block sizes in in the best way.p  pLooking to the card characteristics we see it has 14 sm and capability 3.5, which allows to run 32 concurrent kernels. So, the conclusion I make here is that launching 28 concurrent kernelstwo per each of 14 SM would be the best decision. The first question  am I right herep  pNow, again, we want to optimize each kernels block and grid sizes. Ok, lets look to this characteristic p  pMaximum number of threads per multiprocessor  2048p  pI understand it this way if we launch a kernel with 1024 threads and 2 blocks, these two blocks will be computed simultaneously. if we launch a kernel with 1024 threads and 4 blocks, then two pairs of block will be computed one after another. So, the next conclusion I make is that launching 28 kernels each one with 1024 threads would be also the best solution  because  this is the only way when they can be executed simultaneously on each SM. The second question  am I right here Or there is better solution how to get the simultaneous executionp  pIt would be very nice if you only say am I right or not, and I would be very grateful if you explain where I mistake or propose a better solution.p  pThank you for reading thisp

Negative 1608 pI believe that when creating CPUs, branch prediction is a major slow down when the wrong branch is chosen.  So why do CPU designers choose a branch instead of simply executing both branches, then cutting one off once you know for sure which one was chosenp  pI realize that this could only go 2 or 3 branches deep within a short number of instructions or the number of parallel stages would get ridiculously large, so at some point you would still need some branch prediction since you definitely will run across larger branches, but wouldnt a couple stages like this make sense  Seems to me like it would significantly speed things up and be worth a little added complexity.p  pEven just a single branch deep would almost half the time eaten up by wrong branches, rightp  pOr maybe it is already somewhat done like this  Branches usually only choose between two choices when you get down to assembly, correctp

For example if someone removes a Tag from a Material, then I need to logp  ul li[User12  121212]  codeHappycode tag got removed from codeCrappycode material.li ul  pSo far I got this I can get all the codeObjectStateEntriescode which are modified, added, deleted by usingp  precodecontext.ObjectStateManager.GetObjectStateEntriesEntityState.Added  EntityState.Deleted  EntityState.Modified codepre  pNow, I can check whether this codeObjectStateEntrycode is RelationShip or not usingp  precodeif e.IsRelationship      HandleRelationshipEntrye  else      HandleEntrye  codepre  pWithin codeHandleEntrycode method Entry is not relationship entry, I can check the type of codeEntrycode, in my case it is codeMaterialcode, so Im doingp  precode We care about only Material which are modifed if e.State  EntityState.Modified  e.Entity is Material     return codepre  pOnce, I know codeEntrycode is of type codeMaterial Entrycode, I can get all the columns that have changed for  codeMaterialcode table usingp  precodee.CurrentValues[ARCHIVECOLUMN].ToString  e.OriginalValues[ARCHIVECOLUMN].ToString codepre  pAt this point, I can log all the non FK changes of codeMaterialcode table. But if column is codeFKcode to some other codeentitycode, I cannot resolve that codeFKcode value to corresponding codeEntitycode. I could just know that codeCategoryIDcode has been changed from code42code to code76code but I cannot resolve name of the codeCategorycode itself. I tried approach like casting codeDBDataRecordcode and codeCurrentValueRecordcode to codeEntityKeycode but it is just codeNULLcode.

Negative 1608 pI am terribly sorry about the vague title, but I am having one of them What the  moments. p  pThe premise is the following We have an ASP MVC website, which is a kind of a CMS system, it is connected to an MSSQL Server 2008 R2 and published on a Windows Server 2003. p  pI apologise beforehand for all the stupid things I am going to say about Networks, VPNs and so on, as I am really, really bad on those subjects. p  pWe have offices in two countries and a intranet through VPN. So, our stations are locally connected and the ASP Website is not open to the public. It is published on a virtual machine, hosted on a machine that is in the foreign office. as I said, two offices one in Bulgaria, one in the Netherlandsp  pThe authentication used in the project is Windows Authentication. p  pSo, once upon a time all was great in the kingdom offices. The project worked fine, and anyone could open the site and do his bidding. View, Add, Edit, Delete, all was working.  However, two weeks ago, something happened. Suddenly, out of nowhere, using the project from our office in Bulgaria remember the machine hosting the project is in the Netherlands stopped working PROPERLY. Properly here being the operative word.  Currently, opening the website from Bulgaria works fine. Browsing through its content works fine though many times slower than before. BUT, some functions now seem not to work. Now the interesting word is some What I mean by that is literally that some of the functions stopped working. All through the project there are forms for entering and editing data. It now seems that at most part those actions stopped working. However, there are some that still work. p  pIts time to define a few things. First what not working means. Sadly, I cant really provide a more suitable description as what happens is the following You enter a page, for our example is a page full with hourlog records. You select some things to add, enter how many hours and click Add. What happens next is ... nothing. The browser loads for a looot of time before saying  the web page is not available. I am guessing the session is then destroyed, because opening another tab of the project, or refreshing the current page also stops working. p  pWhen you restart the browser, however, the website is working again. AND WHAT IS amazing is that the action you executed was completed  meaning that the hour you logged was saved, and its there in the table nowp  pMore than a few actions like that behave the exact same way. The browser loads for a long time and then it says the web page is not available and you have to restart it if you want to continue your work. Interestingly enough, there are actions that complete There are some separate forms that actually submit and return correctly. So it is just in some parts of the application. p  pFurthermore, please bare with me its about to get interesting, there is NOTHING, and I mean nothing different from the calls that actually work. I examined the code symbol by symbol and there is nothing to separate the working and not working actions.  I am not a complete idiot or so Id like to believe and tested extensively for call size the amount of the transferred data and timeouts the time the calls take to complete and again there were no noticeable differences. Some actions involving more data complete, when some actions with little to no call size fail. The same with slow and fast actions.p  pOh, I havent yet mentioned the kicker  in our offices in the Netherlands the project is working perfectly There is no lag, there are no errors, no waiting and certainly no breaking and having to restart the browser. p  pSo what have I done to try diagnosing the problem. To begin with, I tried tracking the http calls I make with fiddler. When we get to the part where the mysterious culprit destroys the peace in our kingdom, the http request gets a 504 receive failurep  pThe call in the Network tab of Chrome is giving me a failed netERRCONNECTIONABORTED and a Size content of 0 B. p  pI have error handling. I am using Elmah, but am receiving no errors. No errors get prompted on the browser. Nothing, just the 504 Error from fiddler. p  pThings that should also be mentioned arep  pI have backups of the project going back, months, even years, when everything was well. I restored more than a bunch of them but to no avail. They are also behaving the same way.p  pThere havent been any updates to the project or anything new installed on the server NEAR the date everything went bad.p  pI researched the 504 error and saw that it is network related. I am advancing under the expression that the problem is not in my project for the reasons listed above and more includingp  ul liawful connection to the serverli liinability to open files and folders from my local machine when logged on the serverli ul  pUnfortunately, the administrators have restarted every piece of equipment connected to the networking, brought down every firewall, reconfigured every DNS and VPN and still the problem persists. So I no longer believe in anything. p  pSo, thats it. I am sorry for the long post, believe it or not I tried keeping it short and simple.  If anyone has any ideas to what the ... could be causing this issue I would be in hisher debtp  pThank you for the patience and for reading this through. p

Negative 1608 pIm trying to set up an automatic failover system in a 3 nodes redis cluster. I installed redissentinel on each of these nodes juste like this guy  a hrefhttpwww.symantec.comconnectblogsconfiguringredishighavailability relnofollowhttpwww.symantec.comconnectblogsconfiguringredishighavailabilitya.  Everything is fine as long as I have two or three nodes. The problem is that whenever theres only onte node remaining and that its a slave, it does not get elected as master automatically. The quorum is set to 1, therefore the last node detects the odown of the master but cant vote for the failover since theres no majority.p  pTo overcome this surprising issue, I wrote a little script that ask the other nodes for their masters, and if they dont answer I set the current node as the master. This script is called within the redissentinel.conf file, as a notification script. However ... As soon as the redissentinel service is started, this configuration is erased  If I look at the configuration file in etc, the sentinel notificationscript line has disappeared redissentinel rewrites its configuration file so why not BUT the configuration I wrote is no longer available p  precode1  1 name     2 mymaster     3 ip     4 x.x.x.x     5 port     6 6379     7 runid     8 somerunid     9 flags    10 master    11 pendingcommands    12 0    13 lastpingsent    14 0    15 lastokpingreply    16 395    17 lastpingreply    18 395    19 downaftermilliseconds    20 30000    21 inforefresh    22 674    23 rolereported    24 master    25 rolereportedtime    26 171302    27 configepoch    28 0    29 numslaves    30 1    31 numothersentinels    32 1    33 quorum    34 1    35 failovertimeout    36 180000    37 parallelsyncs    38 1 codepre  pThat is the result of the sentinelmasters command.

Negative 1608 pIm trying to wrap a Python codePyObjectcode in an codeObjectcode class. In Python, everything is a codePyObjectcode. A list is a codePyObjectcode, and each item in the list is itself a codePyObjectcode. Which could even be another list. etc.p  pIm trying to allow codefooList[42]  barObjcode style syntax by means of a Proxy pattern a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27680299implementingrecursiveproxypatterninc11herea.p  pNow that I have that working, I want to extend it so that codefooList[42]code can be used as an codeObjectcode. Specifically I want to be able to handle...p  precodefooList[42].myObjMethod fooList[42].myObjMember  ... codepre  pcodeObjectcode has a lot of methods, and currently codefooList[42].myObjMethodcode is going to first resolve codefooList[42]code into a codeProxycode instance, say codetmpProxycode, and then attempt codetmpProxy.myObjMethodcode.p  pThis means I would have to do p  precodevoid ProxymyObjMethod return wrappedob.myObjMethod  codepre  pi.e. manually relay each of codeObjectcodes methods through codeProxycode, which is ugly.p  pI cant see any perfect solution see the above linked answer, but I would be happy to usep  precodefooList[42]gtmyObjMethod codepre  p... as a compromise, seeing as  strongemcanemstrong be overloaded as opposed to code.code which cannot.p  pHowever, I cant find any documentation for overloading codeoperatorgtcode.p  pMy best guess is that it must return a pointer to some object say codepObjcode, and C will invoke codepObjgtwhatevercode.p  hr  pBelow is my attempted implementation. However, Im running into a emtaking the address of a temporary object of type Objectem warning.p  pI have, within my codeObjectcode classp  precodeconst Object operator[] const Objectamp key     const       return Object PyObjectGetItem p, key.p     codepre  pNOTE that const Objectamp runs into emtaking the address of a temporary object of type Objectem warning.p  precodeclass Proxy  private     const Objectamp container     const Objectamp key  public      at this moment we dont know whether it is c[k]  x or x  c[k]     Proxy const Objectamp c, const Objectamp k   containerc, keyk             Rvalue      e.g. cout ltlt myList[5] hits const Object operator[]     operator Object const          return container[key]            Lvalue      e.g. something   myList[5]  foo     const Proxyamp  operator const Objectamp rhsob          PyObjectSetItem container.p, key.p, rhsob.p          return this  allow daisychaining a  b  c etc, thats why we return const Objectamp           const Object operatorgt const  return ampcontainer[key]        ERROR taking the address of a temporary object of type Object  codepre  pThe idea is to allow codemyList[5]gtsomeMemberObj  ...code style syntax.p  pcodemyList[5]code resolves as a codeProxycode instance, which is wrapping an codeObjectcode the sixth element of codemyListcode.

Negative 1608 pIm trying to design a desktop UI for schematics, layout, drawing stuff.  Just looking for high level advice from actual software designers.p  pAssuming an inmemory database, clojure map of arbitrary depth for all user data, and possibly another one for application preferences, etc., Im examining how to do the modelviewcontroller thing on these, where the data may be rendered emand modified byem any one or more ofp  ol liA standalone text field that shows a single parameter, such as box width.li liAn inspector type of view that shows multiple parameters of a selected object, such as box width, height, color, checkboxes, etc.li liA tablespreadsheet type of view that shows multiple parameters of multiple objects, potentially the whole databaseli liA graphical rendering of the whole thing, such as both schematic and layout view.li ol  pModifying any one of these should show up immediately in every other active view, both text and graphical, not after clicking ok... so no modal boxes allowed.  If for some reason the table view, an inspector view, and a graphical rendering are all in view, dragging the corner of the box graphically should immediately show up in the text, etc.p  pThe platform in question is JavaFX, but Id like a clean separation between UI and everything else, so I want to avoid codebindcodeing in the JFX sense, as that ties my design data very tightly to JFX Properties, increases the graininess of the model, and forces me to work outside the standard clojure functions for dealing with data, andor deal heavily with the whole codegetValuecodecodesetValuecode world.p  pIm still assuming at least emsomeem statefulnessmutability, and the use of builtin Clojure functionality such as the ability to codeaddwatchcode on an atomvarref and let the runtime signal dependent functions.p  pPlatformspecific interaction will rest tightly with the actual UI, such as reifying codeActionListenercodes, and dealing with codeObservableValuecodes etc., and will attempt to minimize the reliance on things like JavaFX codePropertycode for actual application data.  Im not entertaining FRP for this.  p  pI dont mind extending JFX interfaces or making up my own protocols to use applicationspecific codedefrecordcodes, but Id prefer for the application data to remain as straight Clojure data, unsullied by the platform.p  pThe question is how to set this all up, with closest adherence to the immutable model.  I see a few optionsp  ol liFinegrain Each parameter valueprimitive ie Long, Double, Boolean, or String is an atom, and each view which can modify the value reaches in as far as it needs to in the database to change the value.  This could suck as there could potentially be thousands of individual values for example points on a handdrawn curve, and will require lots of codederef...code junk.  I believe this is how JFX would want to do this, with giant arrays of Properties at the leaf nodes, etc., which feels bloated.  With this approach it doesnt seem much better than just coding it up in JavaC.li liMediumgrain Each objectrecord in the database is an atom of a Clojure map.  The entire map is replaced when any one of its values changes.  Fewer total atoms to deal with, and allows for example long arrays of straightup numbers for various things.  But this gets complicated when some objects in the database require more nesting than others.li liCoarsegrain There is just one atom the database.  Any time anything changes, the entire database is replaced, and every view needs to rerender its particular portion.  This feels a bit like using a hammer to swat a fly, and a naive implementation would require everything to rerender all the time.  But I still think this is the best trade off, as any primitive has a clear access path from the root node, whether it is accessed on a perprimitive level or perrecord level.li ol  pI also need the ability for one data template to be instantiated many times.  So for example if the user changes a symbol or shape which is used in multiple places, a single edit will apply everywhere.  I believe this also requires some type of pointerlike behavior.  I think I can store a atom to the model, then instantiate as needed, and it can work in any of the above grain models.p  pAny other approaches  Is trying to do a GUI editorlike tool in a functional language just stupid Thanksp

Negative 1608 pHope you guys can clarify something for me.p  pIve been using Android for about 6 months now and Im still confused about the best way to communicate between Activity and Fragments. Ive already read the the info on the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfragmentscommunicating.html relnofollowandroid developer sitea. p  h2Fragment to Activityh2  pRight now I know with 100 absolute certainty that an interface is the best way to communicate from Fragment to Activity. I.e. creating an interface in your Fragment and letting your Activity implement it. This way you can call the method from your interface inside your Fragment and have it handled by the Activity which implements the interface.p  h2Activity to Fragmenth2  pHeres were Im not sure. The android developer site says that in order to communicate with a Fragment you have to put your objects in a Bundle.p  precodeBundle bundle  new Bundle bundle.putIntSOMEIDENTIFIER, myInt codepre  pNow Ive been know to use a Singleton class every now and then when I have quite some functionality that I can separate. Say I have a Singleton called codePersistenceServicecode where I handle all of the persistence related stuff, e.g. saving something in the codeSharedPreferencescode. The codePersistenceServicecode will then hold methods like codeputMyStringString key, String myStringcode or codeputSomeObjectString key, SomeObject someObjcode. This way a class doesnt have to handle persistence itself but can just call the codePersistenceServicecode to do it. p  pNow say I have to update something in my Fragment, a TextView or something. This is what I dop  precodeString myString  PersistenceService.getInstancegetActivity.getMyStringsomeKey textView.setTextmyString codepre  pemI pass in a context codegetActivitycode because I need it to get the codeSharedPreferencescode.emp  pNow my actual question is p  pstrongDo I retrieve my data in the Activity and pass it to the desired Fragment through its Bundle Or do I simply reference my Singleton right in my Fragment and access the data there directly.strongp  pIm not stuck or anything, but Id like to know what you guys would recommend. Any advice, remarks, info etc. is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1608 pI am using moodle open source LMS and create different themes for clients. I have a link that opens a FAQ pdf document in another tab. The problem is that the pdf documents favicon is different from the themes favicon. The pdf is stored in the themes folder, but obviously doesnt reference a layout or anything.p  pThe favicon that shows for the pdf isnt even used in another theme. Is it possible that the pdf itself has a favicon attached to it And how would I change it Ive googled and no one else seems to have had this specific problem.p

Negative 1608 pMy code gets called by AJAX UI Multiple threads, and post data processing it sends output in Json. Recently while refactoring the code, we have shifted lot of common and repeated methods to a separate file, where we have made the them static, since we are not working on any static  shared data.  Following is a sample design our static methodp  precodepublic class Helper     public static C Method1ListltAgt aList, ListltBgt bList           C objC  new C         Create ObjC based on inputs aList and bList        return objC      codepre  pNow, my understanding is that the following call will have no issue, when called in a Parallel.foreach or any other multithread scenario, please verify.p  precodeC resultC  Helper.Method1aList, bList codepre  pHowever we have doubt, can there be a rare case possible where two threads make the above mentioned call and one thread data of aList, bList, is replaced by another thread, thus giving a flawed result may be exception, which can for that matter will be impossible to debug and repeat, since two threads have to go  execute together in precise milli seconds that method takes to executep  pPlease share your view are we on right track to create the above mentioned design or there are pits that we are not able to see. We can easily replace by instance method, they are surely thread safe in this scenario, since each thread has its own instance to work with, but I feel that may not be required and its troublesome to keep creating instance, when we can conveniently work with a static call.p  pPlease note till now I havent seen an issue with code running, but as I said if this ever happens it will be corner case, for two threads to come at same time and one thread replace the input parameter while other thread is still processing result.p

Negative 1608 pI am facing a very weird behaviour of a surfaceview in one of my applications. This application contains a surfaceview as well as other layout elements buttons, textviews etc. In certain situations the surfaceview appears by setting the visibility of all other elements to View.GONE. In other situations the surfaceview shall disappear by setting its visibility to View.GONE or simply overlaying it with other layout elements.p  pThis works out quite well, but as soon as I start a new Intent out of my activity e.g. logging in to Google Play Game services or an Inapp purchase the surfaceview appears on top of all other layout elements for no reason. The other layout elements are not visible but clickable, they are hidden behind the surfaceview.p  pI have no explanation for this behaviour. I considered that in my onPause or onActivityResult methods would be an instruction that makes the surfaceview appear, but this is not the case. By using the debugger I found out that the surfaceview appears on top before onpause and onActivityResult are called. Moreover, I did not call the method setZOrderOnTop on the surfaceview, what could be a possible explaination for this.p  pThis is how I start the new Intent, what makes the Surfaceview appear on topp  precode        startIntentSenderForResultpendingIntent.getIntentSender, 1001,                 new Intent, Integer.valueOf0, Integer.valueOf0,                 Integer.valueOf0 codepre  pI dont know what might cause this behaviour. I am using Android 5.0.1 with Eclipse. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1608 pThis is definitely some sort of bug, but I dont know where to file this, and I want to see if other developers have a workaround.p  pI made this weather app and both my dad and sister downloaded it.

In the meantime, the app stopped working on various devices and I couldnt figure out why. p  pAfter trying nearly everything to reproduce this bug, I finally figured it out. I uninstalled my Android Wear companion app, something other people never had. In doing so, I received this error.

Negative 1608 pDoes somebody know how you can get back the requested URL in the error handling section of an jquery mobile ajax call. I only can get the responseheaders by jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders. Obviously this should be the URL in the Ajax call itself, but since this is working for Android and not for Windows it looks like the URL is different on different devices very strange. Reason for this question On an Android device my app works great, but on a windows phone the same app generated by Phonegap  Cordova I get a 404 back. I dont understand the 404 so I would like to see in an alert statement the requested URL to find out which URL could not be found.p  pI hope somebody can help.p  pThanks in advance.p

in excel. But when I use the arrow keys to go through cells the sheet remains stagnant. i.e. it wont scroll, and when I use my mouse and press the scroll button on scroll bars it works. The cursor keeps going to new cells whose location I can see besides the formula bar in excel 2007. The page however doesnt scroll. I created another excel file using EPPlus which doesnt have this issue. Can anyone please suggest if it possible to control the scroll in the excel spreadsheet schema.p

Negative 1608 pI have two arraysp  precode[a0 b0 c0]  [a1 b1 c1] codepre  pI want to calculate all the possible sums between the two. A possible sum consists of only 1 element for each column slot. For example a possible sum isp  precodea0  b1  c1 codepre  porp  precodea1  b1  c1 codepre  pbut not codea1  a0  b0  c0codep  pIn other words the sum in the example will have 3 slots, each one having only 1 element of the two arrays. From my point of view this looks like counting in binary, where each slot can take only 1 out of two numbers 0 or 1. So in this examplep  p000 means all the elements in the sum come from the first array p  precodesum000  a0  b0  c0. sum111  a1  b1  c1 sum010  a0  b1  c0 codepre  pyou get the memo.p  pI would like to know how can I do this in ruby. Im thinking of a complicated solution where I count in a binary string and for each count I select the correct elements from the arrays. Since I want all the possible combinations 2n, can I code this in a single line or close to thatp
Negative 1608 pIve never seen this happen before. I have an NSArray populated with 6 objects.

Negative 1608 pPrenote The certificates was purchased from a vendor and are valid till 2018 p  pOur Apache for one of our servers Ubuntu 12.04 crashed this morning.

The server did not restart so I am sure no updates where done by accident.p  pI then proceeded to try and get it up and running on one of the 14.04 Ubuntu servers we own. The same problem occurred with the same certificates. I asked the guy who setup the 14.04 apache and he claims the problem we suddenly experienced today with the 12.04 server has always happened on the 14.04 server.p  pI tried reproducing the error on my local 14.04 by installing a new Apache and copying the certificates and one of the config files for one of the sites to my local machine. On my local machine after the setup everything worked perfectly.p  pI have tried comparing openssl versions, lib version between the two 14.04, but everything looks the same. I even upgraded both my local machine and the 14.04 server to ensure the libs and Apache version are identical, but the one works and the other one doesnt and I recon If I can solve this problem for the 14.04 Ubuntu server it will provide me with the information to get the ssl certificate chain up and running on the 12.04 Machine. p  pDoes anyone have an idea why suddenly the 12.04 Ubuntus Apache would stop working with the ssl certaficate chain and the 14.04 server also produces the same error, but my local 14.04 does notp  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p

E.g. we have emERdiagramem which contain elementsp  ol liKey attributes liWeak key attributes liIdentifying relationships liAssociative entities ol  pIn order to translate it into emRelational Modelem we should do some tricks.

Each flight delivers to the ISS one crew and returns another or the same crew. Obviously relationship between the codeFlightcode and codeCrewcode is manytomany and it needs junction relation table. But we can not just relate the codeSpaceShipcode and the codeCrewcode because of spaceships  spaceship can be reusable returnable such as Space Shuttles were.p  pSo the codeFlightcode should look likep  precode  ShipName       FlightName  ShipFlightNum  ...

Negative 1608 pI have scoured through online posts that grudginly but satisfactorily answer two questions I have.p  ol liHow do you execute a timer inside a java loopli liHow many threads can a single jvm instance handleli ol  pSo in the context of the above two questions, its pretty obvious that without much tinkering a jvm with 4GB RAM will handle something below 10k threads. Theres all this stuff about asynchronous eventbased  frameworks which is ok in the context where a threads data is not extremely important across other threads. But what if the data in a timer thread inside a loop is important to the other 10k requestssec p  pReal life situation I can think of is an online questionnaire. Lets say you are having 5 questionnaires. Each questionnaire has 10 questions. You anticipate that you will have 20000 respondents to each questionnaire. All the questionnaires begin at the same time. Each question takes a minute before the other one shows up because u want to ensure objectivity, for instancep  pThat means that per second, you would have to expect to handle at least 20000 threads, if each respondent starts 120th of a second apart. Thats because each request has to sustain its data beyond a second for the next request to use.p  pHow on earth would you scale up to say 100k users given the same context If anything is not clear, ask so that I can clarify. p

Negative 1608 pHave a working Spring REST endpoint using Tomcat 7, running using JDK 1.7. Built using gradle, where codebuild.gradlecode has dependencies on Spring libraries v4.1.6, and codejavax.servletcode codev3.0.1code amongst other things. Added a new method with a simplistic implementation to the codeControllercode class, which returns value of codeDeferredResultltStringgtcode. When I send a codeGETcode request to the endpoint and the new method is invoked, around the time it returns a value I see the following exception logged in server logs see further below for exception stackp  pIn the codeweb.xmlcode file which gets built into my code.warcode there are 34 filters including codespringSecurityFilterChaincode and about 8 filters one of which is for codeorg.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServletcode and with the url pattern rest  which matches the URL for the GET request that fails  with HTTP error code 400. Ive tried adding codeltasyncsupportedgttrueltasyncsupportedgtcode to both the servlet and filter definitions, but this seems to have no visible effect. p  pAny tips on how to troubleshoot this would be much appreciatedp  pmight be worth noting that my simple helloworld Spring REST endpoint in a separate workspace, when deployed to the same version of Tomcat seemed to start working just fine after I added the  to the one and only servlet definition in its web.xml...p  precodejava.lang.IllegalStateException Async support must be enabled on a servlet and for all filters involved in async request processing. This is done in Java code using the Servlet API or by adding ltasyncsupportedgttrueltasyncsupportedgt to servlet and filter declarations in web.xml. at

Negative 1608 pI noticed that when we use DWR, there are many requests to javascript files from the browser.

This is the reason why the browser is reloading the script on every page load.This script is a DWR interface script. When you expose java methods using DWR through a create tag in the dwrem.xml, DWR creates an interface javascript. This file implements javascript methods which invoke the remote java methods using DWREngine.execute. The interface script does not change unless the methods exposed in the dwrem.xml are changed and the application is restarted. Hence the script should have been cacheable.p  pHow to add LastModified in the responsep

Negative 1608 pI have a codeUITableViewControllercode that Im building up in my application. This codeUITableViewControllercode codeSelectedLanguagescode is called from another codeUITableViewControllercode codeChooseLanguagecode where there is a static list of languages for the user to select. p  pIn the codeSelectedLanguagescode codeUITableViewControllercode, I want to achieve the followingp  ul li2 Sectionsli liThe first section will have between 1 and 5 cellsli liThe second section will always have 12 cells. li ul  pThe number of cells in the first section is entirely dependent on which language the user chooses in the codeChooseLanguagecode codeUITableViewControllercode. For example, clicking on English will mean the first section in the codeSelectedLanguagecode codeUITableViewControllercode will have 5 cells, but choosing codeFrenchcode in the codeChooseLanguagecode codeUITableViewControllercode will mean the first section in the codeSelectedLanguagecode will only have 1 cell. p  pAs mentioned, the second section will always have 12 cells in the codeSelectedLanguagecode. p  pI have designed this codeUITableViewControllercode in codeInterface Buildercode. What Ive seen is that only if the the Content is specified as codeStatic Cellscode can you have multiple sections. p  pEven if you set the Content to Dynamic and Grouped, I cant seem to find a way to determine sections other than in code. p  pThe reason Im defining this in codeInterface Buildercode is because section 1 and section 2 will need to have a very customised layout of the size of the cells, as well as the labels that go into each cell. p  pThe content of the first section is not dynamic it is static because while building this application, Ill know exactly how many cells there should be in the first section for each language, so in my head, it is correct to use a Static cell. p  pstrongMy question is, how can I achieve setting the number of cells in the top section, in codestrongp  pIn the prepareForSegue of the ChooseLanguage, I could check the called cell title and then perform some action in the SelectedTransactions. The action to perform here is what Im confused about. p  pI know theres the method code NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersectioncode in the codeUITableViewcode codeData Sourcecode, but Im not sure how and what to do with this with my particular situation. p  pAny guidance would be really appreciated. p

Negative 1608 pI have a solution split into two projects  A class library containing all of my model classes lets call it strongBusinessstrong, and an ASP.Net MVC project.p  pMy strongBusinessstrong classes are meant to be generic and work for multiple types of projects. For this reason, they dont contain any strongdata annotationsstrongstrongassociationsstrong to other classes, only strongmember variablesstrongstrongpropertiesstrongstrongconstructorsstrong.p  pUsing the codefirst approach, how should I design my ASP.Net models to work with my strongBusinessstrong models.p  pMy initial taught was setting my strongBusinessstrong classes as partial classes and then overwrite my properties by adding the necessary strongdata annotationsstrongstrongassociationsstrong. I cant do that because we are dealing with two separate projects.p  pI was also thinking that I could use stronginheritancestrong. My ASP.Net models could inherit from the Business classes and I could add my strongdata annotationsstrongstrongassociationsstrong on top of that. This seems a bit messy and illogical though, as I would need to define all of my constructors in this new subclass.p  pIs there a smart way of doing this in a cleanlyp  pEDIT p  pMy strongBusinessstrong classes have validations by throwing exceptions in the property setters.
