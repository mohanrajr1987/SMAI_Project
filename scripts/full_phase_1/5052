Positive 5052 pi am a total amateur and i hit a wall. I thought a couple of hours before i decided to post, before that i tried to find the failure myself.p  pIm a larper and im in PostApocalyptic stuff and tried to program a little tool just as an effect for an event, but even if the compiler doesnt show any errors, there is something wrong.p  pIm trying to make a menu with different layers. A Start layer which goes to the real menulayer, from there i can choose which way i wanna go to show a preprogrammed status, but there is the thing. It doesnt matter which choice i made, i always land on the realmenulayer. The start works, i can choose to go to the real menu or to quit. But after that 13 directly goes to the same menu and 4 produces a memoryaccess failure and the whole thing crashes.p  pSomewhere i did somethin wrong and i am not able to find the failure.

Positive 5052 pHello I have this custom walker set up for my wordpress theme to display my main menu.  I started tweaking it a month or so ago, but have since been working on some other bits.  Coming back to it, I am a little lost as to where I was when I left off.p  pThe only real problem I can see at the moment is that the walker is generating a double menu.  So every link is shown twice.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why the menu items are showing up twicep  pHere is the custom walkerp  precodeclass CustomWalkerNavMenu extends WalkerNavMenu      function startelampoutput, item, depth  0, args  array, id  0          if  depth              indent  strrepeatt, depth         else             indent            extractargs, EXTRSKIP         linkName  applyfilters thetitle, itemgtposttitle, pagegtID           iflinkNameHOME             output . indent . ltli iditem.itemgtID.gtlta href classall datafilter.allgt.linkName.ltagt         else             output . indent . ltli iditem.itemgtID.gtlta href class.strtolowerlinkName. datafilter..strtolowerlinkName.gt.linkName.ltagt                   iflinkNameCONTACT             output . indent . ltli iditem.itemgtID.gtlta hrefcontact classcontact datafilter.allgt.linkName.ltagt         else             output . indent . ltli iditem.itemgtID.gtlta href class.strtolowerlinkName. datafilter..strtolowerlinkName.gt.linkName.ltagt                     function endelampoutput, page, depth  0, args  array                  output . ltligtn        codepre  pThanksp
Positive 5052 pI have a problem but do not know how to move, so I would advise ...p  pI want to create a dynamic menu in drupal mainmenu. The current one is ugly, is a list. I want a menu where there are different voices, and during the hover event appears a little window with the sub. Or by moving a menu with submenus that are activated at the click of the item.p  pI have no problem with JavaScript to create anything ...p  pThe real problem is that I do not know how to act to achieve this. In my case the mainmenu is created I think from the strongmodule blockstrong.p  pMaybe I should change something in the formp  pI wish I had some of your advice ... There are lightweight modules that allow me to create menus that editable adding file.js p  pThanks a lot..p  pand sorry if the question is too general.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  ppractically the mainmenu is called strongblocksystemmainmenustrong, I could create a js file that runs every tag li menu items, and bring up submenus durnate the hover or clickp  pYou think its good as an idea fast or weight code, slow to loadp
Positive 5052 pThis is a hard question, and ive seen answers to this question, but those answers are not in dumb enough terms for a noob like me. So, my question is, that if I were to go into a menu, choose an option, complete that option, and I need to go back to the main menu to do another option, can anyone explain in Noobie terms Thanks.p  pAn Examplep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltwindows.hgt using namespace std  int main      cout ltlt Main Menu ltlt endl     cout ltlt 01. This Option ltlt endl     cout ltlt 02.

Positive 5052 pOther than on the navigation bar, the rest of Chrome and FF and IE are displaying elements on the rest of the page in similar sizes that look fine.  In Chrome amp MSIE the text in the menu items is much smaller than in FF, so I cant just increase fontsize.  FF is also much bigger on the rest of the page but its not creating a problem.    Chrome has the biggest discrepancy between its interpretation of menu font as small vs the rest of the page.p  pWhen using zoom to enlarge the site seems to scale reasonably intact in all three browsers.  The Chrome nav menu text scales but since it starts out smaller, its still smaller than IE or FF.  p  pI used pxs in the nav bar and havent used ems yet.  I tried to switch here but couldnt figure out a sensible conversion from px to em and got huge text even with 1 em.p  pSearching I found lots about how IE and FF use a different font presentation  method from Chrome so thats why the results are different.  Also its why google spreadsheets have a much better more crisp font in Google Chrome than in FF or IE.  The articles all seemed to say that you have to live with the difference.p  pSo whats a way to fix this  Switch to ems  Hows that work here  Use a browser or settings detection and setup a different bar for Chrome  Though that goes against my programming instincts.p  pa hrefhttp[urlhttppostimage.org][img]https6.postimg.orgd04nw50kxSizingFiguringout.jpg[img][url]20[urlhttppostimage.org]free20image20uploader[url] relnofollowImage of the three browsers side by side at 100 each.a   p  pFF on the left is bigger on both menu and the rest.  Chrome in the middle is smallest menu.  IE on right has not quite but still very small menu.  But Chromes rest is bigger than IEs.  So Chromes ratio of menu to the rest has the most discrepancy.   So how to set them so the all look alright p  blockquote   pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXFMLW.jpg altImage of 3 browser39s]p blockquote  pHere is a a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netcurlspy4azr4c1 relnofollowjsfiddlea.p  pHere is htmlp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltbody bgcolorFFFFFF text000000gt         lt Header banner table gt         lttable width100 border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0 bgcolorFFFFFF height108gt             lttrgt                 lttd width158gtImage                     ltbrgtis herelttdgt                 lt Big banner area gt                 lttdgt                     lttable width100 valigntop border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt                         lttrgt     lt banner columns, 5 of them for various imagesgt                             lttd valigntop bgcolor0099CC height127 width116gtlttdgt                             lttd valigntop bgcolor0099CC height127 width55gtlttdgt                             lttd valigntop bgcolor0099CC height127 width677gt                                 ltbrgt                                 ltdiv aligncentergt ltfont faceComic Sans MS size5 colorCCCCCCgt Our Groups Name ltbrgt     ltfontgt                                  ltdivgt                             lttdgt                             lttd valigntop bgcolor0099CC width170 height121gtlttdgt                             lttd valigntop bgcolor0099CC height127 width150gtlttdgt                         lttrgt                     lttablegt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lt make new row for menu gt             lttrgt                 lttd valigntopgt                     lt A space holder that matches the logo area gt                 lttdgt                 lt a 2nd column, menu gt                 lttdgt                     lttable width100 border0 cellpadding0 cellspacing0 bgcolor009999gt                         lttrgt                             lttd valigntopgt                                 ltdiv classnavgt                                     ltul classNavButtonsOriginalgt                                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.ourgroup.comindex.phpgtHomeltbrgt ltagt                                         ltligt                                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.ourgroup.comOurgroup.phpgtUpcomingltbrgt Eventsltagt                                         ltligt                                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.ourgroup.comOurgroupMembership.phpgtMembershipltbrgtRSVPsltagt                                         ltligt                                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.ourgroupdc.comourgroupOngoing.phpgtOngoingltbrgtamp Newsltagt                                         ltligt                                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.ourgroup.comOurgroupActivities.phpgtPast Events      ltspan classtinyandgt ampltspangtltbrgt       Workshopsltagt                                         ltligt                                     ltulgt                                 ltdivgt                             lttdgt                         lttrgt                     lttablegt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt         lt End of Big banner area gt         lt End of Title banner gt     ltbodygt codepre  pAnd here is the CSS usedp  precode  .NavButtonsOriginal          fontfamily Calibri         fontsize 12px         color E0DFE8         backgroundcolor 009999         verticalalign top         liststyleimage none         liststyletype none            Unordered list       .nav ul          liststyletype none         margin 0         padding 0         backgroundcolor 009999           anchor       .nav a          display block         width 81px           list item       .nav li          display inline         float left           anchor link amp anchor visited       .nav alink, .nav avisited          display block         width 81px         fontweight bold         color E0DFE8         backgroundcolor 009999         textalign center         padding 4px         textdecoration none         texttransform uppercase           anchor hover amp anchor active       .nav ahover, .nav aactive .nav afocus          backgroundcolor 000066          .tinyand          fontsize 8px      codepre  pYou can find a live version on this site a hrefhttpwww.genafterdc.com relnofollowhttpwww.genafterdc.comap  pI havent gotten any answers yet, and will definitely be picking one that helpsp

Negative 5052 pI was wondering if anyone knew of any limitations to using Windows XP as a File and SQL server. I am asking because one of the applications we sell, requires the customer to setup a server for filesharing and as a SQL Server. We already allow them to use SQL Express, but we wanted to see if we can suggest Windows XP as a low cost alternative to Windows Server. The only potential problem that I could see if there were limits on the number of concurrent connections to either the files or the database. We are only thinking of recommending this for smaller sized companies who would have 1015 users.p

Negative 5052 pCould anyone suggest books or materials to learn unit test p  pSome people consider codes without unit tests as legacy codes. Nowadays, Test Driven Development is the approach for managing big software projects with ease. I like C a lot, I learnt it on my own without any formal education. I never looked into Unit Test before, so feel left out. I think Unit Tests are important and would be helpful in the long run. I would appreciate any help on this topic. p  pMy main points of concern arep  ol lipWhat is a Unit Test Is it a comprehensive list of test cases which should be analyzed So lets us a say i have a class called Complex Numbers with some methods in it lets says finding conjugate, an overloaded assignment operator and an overloaded multiplication operator. What should be typical test cases for such a class Is there any methodology for selecting test casespli lipAre there any frameworks which can create unit tests for me or i have to write my own class for tests I see an option of Test in Visual Studio 2008, but never got it working.pli lipWhat is the criteria for Units tests Should there be a unit test for each and every function in a class Does it make sense to have Unit Tests for each and every classpli ol

Negative 5052 pSigning an assembly in .NET involves a publicprivate key pair.

But howp  pIm a bit at a loss how to start this.

This information is posted to the webserver along with an md5 fingerprint of some system info nic, computer name, assembly major and minor version. The webserver answers by email checks validity of email address with an encrypted version of the tuple expiry date, fingerprint that is then saved to disk. On startup, this can be decrypted and compared with current date and regenerated fingerprint.p  pemEDITem OK, so I dont have all the answers to my question yet.

Ive been going through this code for hours, and cant get to grips with it.p  pObviously it should work fine, if I did something likep  precodeif feed.updated   puts feed.newentries.count   rssObject  initializefeedurl else codepre  pBecause that would reinitialize my instance variable with a brand new feed object, and the updates would come again.p  pBut that also means that any new update added on that exact moment would be lost, as well as strongmassive overkillstrong, as Id have to load the thing again.p  pThanks in advancep

WebRequest.DefaultProxy is a IWebPRoxy class  but UseDefaultCredentials is not a method on the IWebProxy class, rather it is only on WebProxy and in turn, How to set the proxy to the WebRequest.DefautlProxy if they are two different classesp  pHere is my current method to read the stored form settings by the user  but I am not sure if this is correct, not enough, overkill, or just wrong because of the mix of WebProxy and IWebProxyp  precode    private WebProxy proxyInfo  new WebProxy     private WebProxy SetProxyInfo              if UseProxy                       if UseIEProxy                               is doing this enough to set this as default for WebClient                 IWebProxy iProxy  WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy                  if UseIEProxyCredentials                                      proxyInfo.UseDefaultCredentials  true                                  else                                       is doing this enough to set this as default credentials for WebClient                     WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy.Credentials  new NetworkCredentialProxyUsername, ProxyPassword                                           else                               is doing this enough to set this as default for WebClient                 WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy  new WebProxyProxyAddress, ParseLib.StringToIntProxyPort                 if UseIEProxyCredentials                                      proxyInfo.UseDefaultCredentials  true                                  else                                      WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy.Credentials  new NetworkCredentialProxyUsername, ProxyPassword                                                 Do I need to WebClient to absorb this returned proxy info if I didnt set or use defaults         return proxyInfo      codepre  pIs there any reason to not just scrap storing app specific proxy information and only allow the app the ability to use the default proxy information amp credentials for the logged in user Will this ever not be enough if using HTTPp  pPart 2 Questionbr How can I test that the WebClient instance is using the proxy information or notp

Negative 5052 pI havent done much frontend development in about 15 years since moving to database development.

Negative 5052 pC certainly isnt my strong suit so I appreciate all the generous folk sharing their knowledge. Im working with a Windows Form and Ive read up on events and have found some excellent help on how to modify a TabControl so I can have an OnDraw event that will add some coloring to the tabs.p  pThe color of each tab is based upon the state of a connection variable Current green Lost red Stale yellowp  pThe OnDraw event works excellent for updating the color of each tab, but that only occurs when the user selects a different tab to view.p  pWhat I would like to happen is for the color of each tab to be updated whenever the connection state changes. For example, lets say Tab1 is colored green, but then the connection state changes to stale so now the tab needs to be colored yellow but it wont get colored like that until the user clicks on a different tab and the OnDraw event is triggered.p  pSo Im trying to figure out how to do that. When the OnDraw event is triggered normally by the user clicking on a different tab a DrawItemEventArgs parameter is passed into the even handler. That variable is already populated with the pertinent data needed to figure out which tab was clicked on, the boundaries of that tab and etc. So I am unsure where it came from or how I can programmatically recreate such a call to recolor the tabs whenever the connection variable changes.p  pPlease let me know if I need to clarify anything Thank you. p

Negative 5052 pSo, I was thinking about making a simple random world generator. This generator would create a starting cell that would have between one and four random exits in the cardinal directions, something like a maze. After deciding those exits, I would generate a new random cell at each of those exits, and repeat whenever a player would get near a part of the world that had not yet been generated. This concept would allow a infinite world of sorts, all randomly generated however, I am unsure of how to best represent this internally. p  pI am using C which doesnt really matter, I could implement any sort of data structure necessary. At first I thought of using a sort of directed graph in which each node would have directed edges to each cell surrounding it, but this probably wont work well if a user finds a spot in the world, backtracks, and comes back to that spot from another direction. The world might do some weird things, such as generate two cells at one location.p  pAny ideas on what kind of data structure might be the most effective for such a situation Or am I doing something really dumb with my random world generationp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Chrisp

Negative 5052 pGood evening,p  pI am working to get my head around unit testing and Im having a little trouble determining how far I can push unit testing before it turns into integration testing.p  pAn example from the project Im working on now it has a class that performs LDAP searches against Active Directory using DirectorySearcher and returns the results as Person objects.  My first inclination was to grab the interface for DirectorySearcher and then create a fairly sophisticated stub that I can use for testing.  However, that proved problematic because DirectorySearcher doesnt seem to use an interface and it would require a lot of code to stub it out successfully.p  pMy next thought was to create an Searcher class that internally uses DirectorySearcher, which would let me test the mapping between the LDAP results and the Person object mapping, but that doesnt gain me very much and its yet another level of abstraction.p  pSo I guess the bottom line is this is there a way structure this so I can do most of my work with unit testing  Id really rather keep the integration test suite as small as possible, since I have to do the testing against an external data source that keeps changing.  I suspect theres a pattern for doing this, but I havent been able to find it.p  pThanksp

Negative 5052 pI have a Google App Engine app that uses JavaScript for some fairly standard functionality. One button, the save button, should save a textfield into an entry in the datastore.

Also, as Im a bit new to JavaScript  jQuery over App Engine, I think I may be just solving this problem wrong, so Im open to other design choices.p

From feedback in a recent thread I started I now believe this was not a good idea, and working with impersonation has been a headache.p  pI also thought about using a webservice but some of our clients just run the application on there laptops with no windows server.

Negative 5052 pIm currently porting a C application to a slightly restricted environment. The application uses the STL, string and stream classes. Im rewriting simplified versions of these that will play nicely in my environment.p  pWhat Im concerned about is that my application is compiling even without all the necessary operator definitions. For example, for my string classes I definedp  precodestring operator const stringamp lhs, const stringamp rhs codepre  pand this was enough. However, I noticed there were often cases that had mystring  some constant string and this isnt defined in my code anywhere. When I explicitly added it it was usedp  precodestring operator const stringamp lhs, const char rhs codepre  pWhat was going on before that It compiled successfully before I added the second function. Surely the compiler wouldnt be able to infer how to concatenate cstyle strings to my string class.p  pIm getting strange behaviour in my program now and Im wondering if its due to other operators left undefined. Is there any way to enforce the compiler to require such operator definitions if its needed by the programp  pP.S. My string class is in a unique namespace and unrelated to stdp

Negative 5052 pI am using several threads to do some heavy and errorprone processing on a large data set. I require all threads to finish execution, regardless of whether they throw an exception or terminate normally no value is returned, before the program can continue. I am using a codeCountDownLatchcode to achieve this, and an codeExecutorServicecode to actually run the jobs. I want the worker threads lets call them codeJobManagercodes for the sake of argument to notify the latch even if they throw an exception. A codeJobManagercode can take anywhere between a second and an hour to complete, and may fail at any time. The idea is to invoke the finalizer method of codeJobManagercode if an exception is thrown. Now, the codeExecutorServicecode likes to catch exceptions or to conceal the true origin of the ones it does not. I have though of a few ways around this, neither of which is satisfactoryp  ol lipUse codeExecutorServiceexecuteRunnable rcode rather than codesubmitRunnable rcode. I can do that since I do not care about the return value of the codeJobManagercode. I have provided a custom codeThreadFactorycode, which attaches an codeUncaughtExceptionHandlercode to each newly created thread. The problem with this approach is that when codeUncaughtExceptionHandleruncaughtExceptionThread t, Throwable ecode is invoked, codetcodes codeRunnablecode is of type codeThreadPoolExecutorWorkercode, and not of type codeJobManagercode, which prevents me from invoking the finalizer method.pli lipUse a custom codeExecutorServicecode and override the codeafterExecuteRunnable r, Throwable tcode method. This suffers from the same problem as 1.pli lipWrap the whole codeJobManagerdoWorkcode in a codecatchcode statement and use the return value to indicate if an exception was thrown. I can then codesubmitcode the jobs and use codeFutureTaskgetcode to decide if an exception was thrown. I do not like this solution because I feel return codes the wrong tool when you have an elaborate exception mechanism. Moreover, codegetcode will wait unless interrupted, which means I cannot handle errors in other threads immediately.pli lipGet rid of the codeCountDownLatchcode. Store all codeFuturecodes in a list and repeatedly poke in until I am satisfied with the states. This might work, but feels like a dirty hack.pli ol  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5052 pI have a JXTree and Id like to add searching to it this waybr As the user types, the model returns the matching elements of the tree and selects the first one of the set in the trees view.

Negative 5052 pI have some 2D data which contains edges which were rasterized into pixels. I want to implement an efficient data structure which returns all edge pixels which lie in a strongnonaxisalignedstrong 2D triangle.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCoOf6.png altSpatial query for sparse datap  pThe image shows a visualization of the problem where white denotes the rasterized edges, and red visualizes the query triangle. The result would be all white pixels which lie on the boundary or inside the red triangle.p  ul lipWhen further looking at the image, one notices that we have strongsparse booleanstrong data, meaning that if we denote black pixels with a 0 and white pixels with a 1, that the number of 1s in the data is much lower than the number of 0s. Therefore, rasterizing the red triangle and checking for each point on its inside whether it is white or black is not the most efficient approach.pli lipBesides the sparseness of the data since the white pixels origin from edges, it is in their nature to be strongconnected togetherstrong. However, at junctions with other lines, they have more than two neighbors. Pixels which are at a junction should only be returned once.pli lipThe data must be processed in strongrealtimestrong, but with no GPU assistance. There will be strongmultiple queriesstrong for different triangle contents, and after each one, strongpoints may be removed from the data structurestrong. However, new points wont be inserted anymore after the initial filling of the data structure.pli lipThe strongquery triangles are already knownstrong when the rasterized edges arrive.pli lipThere are strongmore query triangles than data edgesstrong.pli ul  pThere are many a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpatialindexSpatialIndex relnofollowspatial data structuresa available. However Im wondering, which one is the best one for my problem. Im willing to implement a highly optimized data structure to solve this problem, as it will be a core element of the project. Therefore, also mixes or abbreviations of data structures are welcomep  ul lipa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHilbertRtree relnofollowRtreesa seem to be the best data structure which I found for this problem until now as they provide support for rectanglebased queries. I would check for all white pixels within an AABB of the query triangle, then would check for each returned pixel if it lies within the query rectangle.p  pHowever, Im not sure how well Rtrees will behave since edgebased data will not be easily groupable into rectangles, as the points are clumped together on narrow lines and not pread out.p  pIm alo not sure if it would make sense to prebuild the structure of the Rtree using information about the query triangles which will be made as soon as the structure is filled as mentioned before, the query triangles are already known when the data arrives.pli lipReversing the problem seems also to be a valid solution, where I use a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSegmenttreeGeneralizationforhigherdimensions relnofollow2dimensional intervala tree to get for each white pixel a list of all triangles which contain it. Then, it can already be stored within all those result sets and be returned instantly when the query arrives. However, Im not sure how this performs a the number of triangles is higher than the number of edges, but still lower than the number of white pixels as an edge is mostly split up into 2050 pixels.pli lipA data structure which would exploit that white pixels have most often white pixels as neighbors would seem to be most efficient. However, I could not find anything about such a thing until now.pli ul

Negative 5052 pJust wondering your opinion on how I should model my documents for this scenario.p  pAt the moment I have what seems a complex MultiMap index which is pulling in counters  stats from several other document collections, on my dev machine its returning a small subset of test data in under 80ms which im happy with.p  pWhat is the performance going to be like when this goes on my production server, on average each mix will receive around 500 plays per week, 200 downloads per week and a handful of likes, favourites and comments. I will be displaying 2025 mixes per page.p  pWould you keep this design, or would it be better to denormalize my counters and store them on the Audio document, using the index would be alot less work

Negative 5052 pIve been trying to get what I believe to be the simplest possible form of threading to work in my application but I just cant do it.p  pWhat I want to do I have a main form with a status strip and a progress bar on it. I have to read something between 3 and 99 files and add their hashes to a string[] which I want to add to a list of all files with their respective hashes. Afterwards I have to compare the items on that list to a database which comes in text files. Once all that is done, I have to update a textbox in the main form and the progressbar to 33 mostly I just dont want the main form to freeze during processing.p  pThe files Im working with always sum up to 1.2GB  a few MB, meaning I should be able to read them into byte[]s and process them from there I have to calculate CRC32, MD5 and SHA1 of each of those files so that should be faster than reading all of them from a HDD 3 times.p  pAlso I should note that some files may be 1MB while another one may be 1GB. I initially wanted to create 99 threads for 99 files but that seems not wise, I suppose it would be best to reuse threads of small files while bigger file threads are still running. But that sounds pretty complicated to me so Im not sure if thats wise either.p  pSo far Ive tried workerThreads and backgroundWorkers but neither seem to work too well for me at least the backgroundWorkers worked SOME of the time, but I cant even figure out why they wont the other times... either way the main form still froze. Now Ive read about the Task Parallel Library in .NET 4.0 but I thought I should better ask someone who knows what hes doing before wasting more time on this.p  pWhat I want to do looks something like this without threadingp  precodeListltstring[]gt fileSpecifics  new Listltstring[]gt  int fileMaxNumber  42  something between 3 and 99, depending on file set  for int i  1 i lt fileMaxNumber i      string fileName  Cpathtofile  i.ToStringD2  .ext  file01.ext  file99.ext     string fileSize  new FileInfofileName.Length.ToString     byte[] file  File.ReadAllBytesfileName      hash calculations using SHA1CryptoServiceProvider etc., no problems with that so Ill spare you that, return strings     file  null  I didnt yet check if this made any actual difference but I figured it couldnt hurt     fileSpecifics.Addnew string[]  fileName, fileSize, fileCRC, fileMD5, fileSHA1     look for files in text database mentioned above, i.e. first check for file bundles with the same amount of files I have here then compare file sizes, then hashes  again, no problems with that so Ill spare you that the database text files are pretty small so parsing them doesnt need to be done in an extra thread. codepre  pWould anybody be kind enough to point me in the right direction Im looking for the easiest way to read and hash those files quickly I believe the hashing takes some time in which other files could already be read and save the output to a string[], without the main form freezing, nothing more, nothing less.p  pIm thankful for any input.p  pEDIT to clarify by backgroundWorkers working some of the time I meant that for the very same set of files, maybe the first and fourth execution of my code produces the correct output and the UI unfreezes within 5 seconds, for the second, third and fifth execution it freezes the form and after 60 seconds I get an error message saying some thread didnt respond within that time frame and I have to stop execution via VS.p  pThanks for all your suggestions and pointers, as you all have correctly guessed Im completely new to threading and will have to read up on the great links you guys posted. Then Ill give those methods a try and flag the answer that helped me the most. Thanks againp

First I want to find the Total number of employees for a Each product. Lets say this value be A. Now I want to count the number of Employees to whom a particular activity is assigned grouped by Product and where status is Either New Or In process. Lets say i.e B. Like. If employees having FName CEmpID  1, DEmpID  2, EEmpID  3, FEmpID  4 belongs to product X. So my A according to this is 4. Now in ATTTable AssignedToID are  1 and 3 and there Product is same i.e X and status is 1new 3In process. For 2 and 4 its closed or on hold. Now my B according to this is 2. Finally AB will give me my 3rd value lets say H. In my query table I want to values of A, B and H. Can u please tell me how i can do this. Its a bit tricky and wasnt able to get on this one.

Negative 5052 pI have a program with a MenuStrip at the top, it currently has 4 items.  What Im essentially trying to do is make sure that all 4 of these menu items are visible if the user shrinks the width.p  pMy initial attempt was to get the total number of items on the MenuStrip by simply grabbing the item collection then grab the bounds of the last item on the strip.  After retrieving the bounds variable, I then do a quick calculation of the bounds.x  bounds.width to make sure that the form.width is not less than that, if so, it resizes.  All of this takes place within the ResizeEnd event for the form.p  precodeprivate void FMainResizeEndobject sender, EventArgs e              ToolStripItemCollection tcol  menuStrip1.Items         int howMany  tcol.Count         var mibounds  tcol[howMany  1].Bounds         if this.Width lt mibounds.X  mibounds.Width            this.Width  mibounds.X  mibounds.Width      codepre  pNow, the code seems to work, most of the time.  I found that if I shrunk the form so that either the 2nd or 3rd item dissapeared, it resized too thin and left the 4th menu invisible.  At that point, interestingly enough, if I simply clicked on the right edge of the form  as if I would be resizing but not moving the form, it would then recover to the correct width and display all 4 menu items.p  pWhat I found was that the bounds property of the toolstripmenuitem changed and was value a when I started resizing with all 4 showing and value b when only 3 were showing.p  pIm now trying to figure out a more reliable way to make sure that all my menu items are visible and the form resize to the proper width.p  pSorry if this doesnt explain it properly as this is a emweirdem problem for me.p

Negative 5052 pMy goal is simple. Id like to be able to take user input from 4 edittext fields, with ids of et14, and put them into an array named codeaSummary1[]  et1, et2, et3, et4code. The four fields are different data types, two being words, one numbers, and one a password. This will all be displayed in a codeListViewcode. This part I can do. The part I cant figure out is if I want to add a new row in the codeListViewcode, Id like to create a new string array, lets say codeaSummary2[]code with different values, but the same parameters codeword, word, number, passwordcode, then codeaSummary3[]code and so on and so forth.p  pHow would one go about doing this Or if there is a better way, how would I assign variables and strings to list entries with no limit. For instance, with list entry x comes variables w y and z assigned to x, but with variable a comes b c and e, and with q comes r s and t.p

Negative 5052 pI have a pretty basic mobile html site with javascript search to give it offline search functionality. I put in jquery mobile in order to have a fixed toolbar using phone gap and the ccs fixed position is not supported. The problem now is that jquery has affected the search functionality by changing the parameters being passed. p  pYou can see the problem when looking at the url. p  pFor examplep  pIf I search  for stackoverflow p  pThe url should be the following search.htmlsearWordsstackoverflowp  pBelow is what is created note the search box value is Search Specs search.htmlsearWordsstackoverflowampSendSearchSpecs p  pIf I take out the Search Specs from the search button the code just leaves it out, but I get the same result search.htmlsearWordsstackoverflowampSendp  pSo in a nutshell, the jquery mobile scripts jquery1.6.4.min.js and jquery.mobile.min.js are inserting ampSendvalue of search button on the end of the url when the search function is used.p

Using the HTML and CSS as shown above. Now, I also want to fix the header so that it does not move. Basically, only my content section should scroll. However, if I add a positionfixed to the header, my mainimage and content now sit on top of my header. If I add a margintop150px since my header height is 150px to the mainimage, it works fine and moves down appropriately. However if I add a margintop150px to the content, my header moves down by 150px and still sits on top of my content. Can someone please explain why this is happening Thanks in Advance p

Is this the appropriate place to do so Technically, Stripe has the most current data i.e. if the card canceled the account level would be different. Should I be using the Stripe api directly to determine account level It seems like I should have record of that somewhere in my data.p  pAre there any other best practices I should keep in mind while developing knowing that Ill be integrating Stripe in the future p

I dont want to have to loop a collection each time to get the settings as this will, i believe create a new sql query for each product and make accesses the settings a pain. p  pI can create a custom object tblProductsAll, but the only way I can fill this object is... p  precodevar Product  from p in context.tblProducts               join ps in context.tblProductSettings on p.ProdID equals ps.ProdID               where p.CreatorID  1 ampamp ps.ProdCreatorDisplay  1               select new tblProductsAll                                     ProdTitle  p.ProdTitle,                    ProdPrice  ps.ProdPrice                codepre  pI can then pass this model to the razor template.p  pMy question is... is there a better way of setting the properties  There are 20 or more different properties and i dont want to have to keep setting them, repeating code, every time i want the same object somehwere in the site with a differnt where clause.  Is there a way to stop this repetition  i.e. automatically mapping the object, or reusing the select new statement.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p
Negative 5052 pIm in the middle of converting some older code to talk with a custom SCSI device. The original code was written for WinXP and ASPI, and the newer code needs to work on Win7 and SPTI. My problem is that the newer code fails on a call to do a SCSI Mode Select operation with an status code of 2, which is a SCSI Check Condition error  but this doesnt happen with the older code under WinXP.p  pNormally, when you get a Check Condition code, you can issue a Request Sense command to the device to find out what happened. Unfortunately, this device is in my opinion buggy, and always returns everything is okay when you do a Request Sense. So Im working in the dark here.p  pSo Im hoping for some suggestions on what I could be doing wrong with the SPTI code, and would be grateful for any feedback.p  pHere are a few things Ive thought of that may be affecting thisp  ul liThe sequence the device expects is Reserve Unit, Rezero Unit, Mode Select, then some other operations, then Release Unit. It appears Reserve Unit, Rezero Unit, and Release Unit are all working fine, but the other operations fail because Mode Select failed.li liFor each operation, the SPTI code opens and closes a handle to the SCSI host adapter. Should I open a handle in Reserve Unit and leave it open for the entire sequenceli liThe ioctl sent to DeviceIoControl is IOCTLSCSIPASSTHROUGH. Should I be using IOCTLSCSIPASSTHROUGHDIRECT for the Mode Select operation Its a simple operation, so I figured the simpler API would be adequate for this, but maybe Im wrong about that.li ul  pThe code in question isp  precodevoid MSSModeSelectconst ModeSelectRequestPacketamp inRequest, StatusResponsePacketamp outResponse       IPCLOGMSSModeSelect PathIDd, TargetIDd, LUNd, inRequest.mDevice.mPathId,         inRequest.mDevice.mTargetId, inRequest.mDevice.mLun     int adapterIndex  inRequest.mDevice.mPathId     HANDLE adapterHandle  prvOpenScsiAdapterinRequest.mDevice.mPathId     if adapterHandle  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE              outResponse.mStatus  eScsiAdapterErr         return           SCSIPASSTHROUGHWITHBUFFERS sptwb     memsetampsptwb, 0, sizeofsptwb  define MODESELECTBUFSIZE 32      sptwb.spt.Length  sizeofSCSIPASSTHROUGH     sptwb.spt.PathId  inRequest.mDevice.mPathId     sptwb.spt.TargetId  inRequest.mDevice.mTargetId     sptwb.spt.Lun  inRequest.mDevice.mLun     sptwb.spt.CdbLength  CDB6GENERICLENGTH     sptwb.spt.SenseInfoLength  0     sptwb.spt.DataIn  SCSIIOCTLDATAIN     sptwb.spt.DataTransferLength  MODESELECTBUFSIZE     sptwb.spt.TimeOutValue  2     sptwb.spt.DataBufferOffset         offsetofSCSIPASSTHROUGHWITHBUFFERS,ucDataBuf      sptwb.spt.Cdb[0]  SCSIOPMODESELECT     sptwb.spt.Cdb[4]  MODESELECTBUFSIZE      DWORD length  offsetofSCSIPASSTHROUGHWITHBUFFERS,ucDataBuf                          sptwb.spt.DataTransferLength     memsetsptwb.ucDataBuf, 0, sizeofsptwb.ucDataBuf     sptwb.ucDataBuf[2]  0x10     sptwb.ucDataBuf[4]  0x01     sptwb.ucDataBuf[5]  0x04      ULONG bytesReturned  0     BOOL okay  DeviceIoControladapterHandle,                              IOCTLSCSIPASSTHROUGH,                              ampsptwb,                              sizeofSCSIPASSTHROUGH,                              ampsptwb,                              length,                              ampbytesReturned,                              FALSE     DWORD gle  GetLastError     IPCLOG  DeviceIoControl s, okay  worked  failed     if okay              outResponse.mStatus  sptwb.spt.ScsiStatus  0  eOk  ePrinterStatusErr          else              outResponse.mStatus  eScsiPermissionsErr           CloseHandleadapterHandle  codepre

Negative 5052 pI have a popup panel which opens on a button click event. Popup panel height should be fixed and if contents of popup panel exceeds the height of popup panel, then a vertical scroll bar needs to be attached to it, and i should be able to scroll it to see the contents.  I am displaying a flex table in the pop up and the flex table rows and columns vary for different kinds of inputs. so, if the flex table size is bigger than pop up, scroll bar should appear to pop up. I tried with overflowscroll in my css, but it didnt work. is it because of the flex table How to achieve this when i have different widgets place in my pop up Can any body please helpp  pThanks, Sreenivasp

Negative 5052 pEDITbr After a bit more digging I have found that I have a libGL.so at codeusrlibi386linuxgnulibGL.socode and if I move this away then linking works correctly again. After looking at the error line for a while I thought that the full path to libGL.so in the message was suspicious because it would have been looking at multiple locations to find it and usually it only shows the name of the library not one specific full path. So the question now is why did finding the other version cause the search to stop and show a confusing error message Im the i386ness made it incompatible in some way.p  pORIGbr For some reason I am having trouble linking in libGL.so into my application. The issue seems to be that ld or gold in this case is not looking in usrlib which from everything I can find is one of the default locations when trying to find it instead it is looking in a bit of a whacky location e.g.p  blockquote   pusrbinld error cannot open usrlibgcci686linuxgnu4.7......i386linuxgnulibGL.so No   such file or directoryp blockquote  pNow usrliblibGL.so definitely exists and I if I do an explicit Lusrlib in the makefile everything links correctly. p  pIm wondering does anyone know what is going on herep  pInfobr Ubuntu linux 12.10 x86br g 4.7br GNU gold linkerbr CPU AMD Phenom 2 x6br uname m out i686  p  pEDIT Output of link with v parameterp  precodeUsing builtin specs.

Negative 5052 pWe use CentOS6, a RedHat EL6 distro rebuild, and this ships with FireFox10.0.12 ESR.  We recently changed the favicon.ico image on several internal servers.  Actually we just provided the corporate favicon to those sites that had none.p  pNow, the difficulty is this.  When a FF user who visited a given url before the favicon was provided now visits that url following the update then the new favicon is not displayed in either their URL address bar or in the tab for that page.  Instead they see that dashed box outline indicating that no favicon is present. p  pHowever, when a FF user who had never previously visited that same url does so then that FF instance does display the new favicon in both the address bar and tab on that FF browser.p  pI have looked into this briefly and frankly was astounded at how common this problem appears to be and the absolute lack of any sensible response to the issue even on Mozillas own support forums.  I have tried hacking and picking at the places.sqlite store but even deleting the entire places.sqlite file or emptying the favicon tables and restarting firefox does not solve the problem of displaying a changed favicon the tab and url icon display.  All that does is hammer the users bookmarks.p  pNow I can, and have, resorted to the trick of adding codeltlink relicon hreffavicon.icogtcode in the codeltheadgtltheadgtcode block of those urls that use static pages but some are generated dynamically by thirdparty applications. These urls do not offer a convenient method to make this modification to their output.p  pWhere does FireFox10 cache the favicon for a newly visited url and how does one remove that reference from the users profilep

Negative 5052 pToday Ive faced with a strange behavior of NuGet when installing a package.p  pA brief description as a result of my build script theres a NuGet package. I dont change the version each time, so each and every build produces codeMyPackage.1.0.0.nupkgcode. As the final step of the build, I push the package to the NuGet server deployed inside the local network.p  pNow, on a different machine, I run codenuget install MyPackage Source httpmyservernugetcode, which obviously installs the NuGet package.p  pThe problem comes into play when I push another update of codeMyPackagecode  still of version code1.0.0code. When I try to reinstall it on client machine, I get the previous version of the package.p  pI found out a hrefhttpnuget.codeplex.comwikipagetitleMachine20Level20Cache20Part201it is the local cache to be blameda if the package was installed, it gets into the local cache and the next time the package strongof the same versionstrong is installed, it is taken from cache. Fair enoughp  pBut, on the other hand, theres a codeNoCachecode option of the codenuget installcode command, and I expect it to ignore the local cache. p  pHowever, this is not true. The first time I run it with codeNoCachecode, it updates the cache and installs the true latest version. But, the next time the package is still taken from cache, even with codeNoCachecode option.p  pIs it expected Is it because of the version not being changed p  pJust in case all NuGet operations are done with codeNuGet.execode and from PowerShell session.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I observe strange behavior I can only explain by cache expiration. When the package is cached, all subsequent calls to codenuget installcode pull the package from cache, stronguntil some time passesstrong. I didnt notice the exact period, but its definitely more than an hour. After this, codenuget installcode updates the package in the cache, and the situation becomes the same...p
Negative 5052 pWhat I want to do overall is add an ellipse to a canvas to represent the position of a golf ball on the Circumference of a circle when it is struck at a certain angle by a golf putter from the center of that circle.

So I clone this hidden popup which is placed inside jCarousels item and append it to body. Everything works great expect in Opera and IE. Popup appear, but it doesnt leave on mouseleave. It leaves only when I hover other item in jCarousel and it appears again only when I twice hover the item. Well, weird behavior.

Negative 5052 pI have a requirement to implement a screen comprised as three portions and am wondering how best to tackle implementing it  either as one view controller which contains multiple views and manages them all, or have the middle portion of the screen managed by its own view controller which is contained within the other view controller.p  ul liThe red part of the screen will contain a background image, a couple of buttons, a tab, and some dynamic text. It is not a navigation bar.li liThe green part of the screen is just some static images and text.li liThe blue part of the screen is a series of images that will be animated in some way TBD but an automatically rotating or sliding carousel is preferred. THe blue part extends between the red and green parts and will be covered whenever the purple or yellow parts appear.li liThe purple part will programatically slide down and back up in order to display a messageli liThe yellow part will slide down and back up whenever the user drags and drops from a tab in the red part, it will contain some text and a button.li ul  pSo my main question is should a separate contained VC manage the blue part of the screen to deal with the animation or could one VC just manage every view on the screenp  pA secondary question is, is there a readymake way to implement the dragging down and up of the yellow sectionp  pThis is for iOS5 and 5.p  pThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfu9Ve.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 5052 pIm creating a 2D drawing framework for .NET 2.0GDI.p  pI need to be able to define transformations for different visuals, such as rotate and translate transforms.  I also need to be able to transform point coordinates from ancestors to children based on those transformations.p  pSo I have functions like the followingp  precodepublic Matrix TransformToAncestorElement ancestor public Matrix TransformToDescendantElement descendant public PointF TransformPointMatrix matrix, PointF point codepre  pI rely on the matrix class to perform the following functionsp  pMultiply, Invert, TransformPoints, RotateAt, Scalep  pMy problem is that the Matrix class is IDisposable and not convenient to use.  I need to be able to create matrices on the fly.  I need to be able to say, give me a matrix to translate from this element to that element, and use that matrix to transform this point.p  pThe Matrix class allocates unmanaged resources using GDI native interop.  So if I dont dispose it as soon as I no longer need it I could be creating a memory leak.p  pNow as far as I know the Matrix class simply represents an array of 6 elements and it has functions to perform mathematical operations on those elements.  That seems overkill to be making interop calls for.p  pI really just need a lightweight class which stores those 6 values and has code to manipulate them.  Im not comfortable enough with matrix math to write all of the code myself.p

Negative 5052 pemHi everyone to start off, my app involves web scraping and javascript injection authentication, since the site Im trying to access data from, has no api Dont worry its legal. With that said heres my issue regarding a webView and its dataemp  pI currently have two classes, a strongMain Viewstrong, and a strongLogin Viewstrong. When the app is launched, it will look for a stored username, if it finds one it loads up the main view, if it does not it slides up a modal view controller loginView.p  pWhat the loginView allows me to do is authenticate the user, in order to display the page from where I want to scrape data. Once authentication is complete, and the page I need is loaded hidden the loginView slides out of sight. What Im trying to do next us have the mainView scrape the loaded site. I know how to scrape the data, but my problem is communicating that data from the loginView currentURL to my mainView, which will handle the scraping.p  pI also want to have a logout button in the mainView so that when it is pressed, it sends a request to load the logout url in the webview to logout the user.p  pemTo summarize the issue, how would I basically communicate data between my mainViewController and my loginViewControllers webView informationemp  pHelp would be appreciated Thank you so muchp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqAZcN.png altenter image description herep

Negative 5052 pIve been a good JavaScript programmer and adhered to the a hrefhttpjavascript.crockford.comcode.htmlcoding conventionsa enlisted by a hrefhttpcrockford.comDouglas Crockforda. However JavaScript has evolved since then and I believe the naming conventions are now outdated.p  pFor example Crockford saidp  blockquote   pDo not use codecode underbar as the first character of a name. It is sometimes used to indicate privacy, but it does not actually provide privacy. If privacy is important, use the forms that provide a hrefhttpjavascript.crockford.comprivate.htmlprivate membersa. Avoid conventions that demonstrate a lack of competence.p blockquote  pHowever JavaScript now allows you to create nonenumerable properties. Hence it makes sense at least to me  youre allowed to disagree to prefix nonenumerable properties with an underbar to indicate that the property is nonenumerable.p  pWhy should you do sop  ol liBecause a hrefhttpworrydream.comLearnableProgramminglanguagevisual feedback is importanta scroll down to the readability section in the linked article.li liBackwards compatibility. You can filter out properties that begin with an underbar in codefor incode loops.li ol  pLets take another example of what Crockford saidp  blockquote   pGlobal variables should be in all caps. JavaScript does not have macros or constants, so there isnt much point in using all caps to signify features that JavaScript doesnt have.p blockquote  pAs I see it there are two problems with the following conventionp  ol liMost JavaScript programmers dont write global variables in all caps. Its just not natural.li liJavaScript now allows you to create nonwritable properties. Hence it makes sense to use all caps for such properties for the same reasons as I stated above for nonenumerable properties.li ol  hr  pAll thats well and fine, but whats the real question you ask Look at the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsObjectdefinePropertiescodeObject.definePropertiescodea function. The problem is that you need to supply a property descriptor for each property you want to define. This is too verbose. For instancep  precodevar o  , x  0  Object.definePropertieso,      E          value Math.E,         enumerable true,         configurable true          x          enumerable true,         configurable true,         get function               return x         ,         set function y              x  y                codepre  pInstead it would be much better if you could simply dop  precodevar o  , x  0  defineo,      E Math.E,     get x          return x     ,     set xy          x  y       codepre  pThe codedefinecode function would be defined as followsp  precodevar define  function       var defineProperty  Object.defineProperty     var has  Function.call.bindObject.hasOwnProperty     var getDescriptorOf  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor      return function obj, props          for var key in props             if hasprops, key                 definePropertyobj, key,                     getDescriptorOfprops, key       codepre  pHowever now you cant make a property codenonenumerablecode, codenonconfigurablecode or codenonwritablecode easily. Hence I modified the codedefinecode function as followsp  precodevar define  function       var defineProperty  Object.defineProperty     var has  Function.call.bindObject.hasOwnProperty     var getDescriptorOf  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor      return function obj, props          for var key in props              if hasprops, key                  var descriptor  getDescriptorOfprops, key                  if key.charAt0                       descriptor.enumerable  false                  if key.charAtkey.length  1                       descriptor.configurable  false                  if hasdescriptor, value ampamp key  key.toUpperCase                     descriptor.writable  false                  definePropertyobj, key, descriptor                             codepre  pNow properties beginning with an underbar are nonenumerable, properties ending with an underbar are nonconfigurable and data descriptor properties which dont have any lowercase alphabets are nonwritable.p  pSo my question is this  is there any way to make properties nonenumerable, nonconfigurable or nonwritable easily while still adhering to Crockfords naming conventions I know that my own naming conventions have more merits. However I dont want to abandon Crockfords conventions too hastily.p

Negative 5052 pThe problem, essentially, is that I cant get my sitemap config to support multiple sitemaps.  Its always looking for default even when I name my instances and request another.  Now for the background.p  pIve been pouring over the docs for the new implementation of MVCSiteMapProvider.  They are now using Dependency Injection to configure the SiteMapProvider.  We have an existing StructureMap DI implementation, so I followed the instructions and added, in our casep  precodeObjectFactory.Configurex gt  ... x.AddRegistryltMvcSiteMapProviderRegistrygt ...  codepre  pThen I started tweaking the MvcSiteMapProviderRegistry.cs file to implement my multiple sitemap scenario.  I have multiple site map files, either will work as long as its called default.  If I remove the default item then it breaks and complains that default is missing.  Which I assume is because it cant find my instance.  Heres how I have them defined.

Negative 5052 pCould anyone guide me to a suitable tool to debug a C program Its not a simple one and part of a big project. The problem is that I have an array of structures and it is initialised properly. I could check the values using gdb. After the program runs, somewhere the array contents are being overwritten. I am not sure which process is overwriting the contents of this array of structures. Any tool or even a technique within gdb to track this problem Cant do watchpoint from gdb because it cant watch a constant value. Tried valgrind, but doesnt show any memory related issues. Any help, really appreciated. thanks, badri.p

Negative 5052 pThe original problem I am fighting is more complex but for investigating purposes I have simplified the test case to the followingp  ul liSingle fullscreen activityli liProgrammatically created web view that occupies roughly half of the horizontal screen space, 90 of the vertical space and is added to the root view via within the onCreate callli ul  pcode ViewGroup parent  ViewGroup getWindow.getDecorView.getRootView parent.addViewmyWebView codep  ul liweb view opens to google.com viali ul  pcodeloadUrlhttpgoogle.comcodep  ul liAndroidManifest.xml has the propertyli ul  pcodeandroidwindowSoftInputModeadjustPancodep  pWhen clicking on the search box on the google page the keyboard pops up but the web view itself is not shifted up as adjustPan indicates should happen.  The main activity also has a native text field that when clicked will shift the entire layout including web view up as expected.p  pThe behavior is present on 4.2.2 on both a Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus.p  pSo the question is how can I have the windowSoftInputMode property adjustPan be applied correctly to a web view instance so that when the soft keyboard is displayed the entire web view is shifted up by the vertical space taken up by the keyboard.p  pBefore I go down the road of trying to manipulate the layout manually within onMeasure I want to see if there is a consistent  better way to handle this.  The browser obviously handles this situation correctly so not sure why the web view is not able to handle this.p  pOne thing to note is that making the web view fullscreen or a separate activity are not possible options due to an existing architecture that I am not able to change.p

Negative 5052 pI have a web app written with the javaspringhibernate stack, and I have several pieces of code in the app that print out debugging information. For example, I have hibernates showsql attribute set to true so that it shows me the queries it is executing. Another example is whenever an exception is caught, its stack trace is printed out to console. p  pNow, I have moved my WAR to the production server which is running tomcat 7.0.42. However, I am having a problem getting hibernate or mysql queries to execute, so I need to debug the problem. But the problem is catalina.out only shows very minimal messages There is no hibernate output or error stack trace. In fact, none of the logs in the logs directory show output from hibernate or exception stack traces.p  pSo my question is how do I get the same output on the server as I get when Im running my web app locallyp

I looked at WCF rest components but i am worried it required client code to reference the service. I do not want the client to add service reference.

Negative 5052 pWhen I use FIRSTVALUE on a data set that I construct by hand I get one result, and when I use it on a data set that results from a left join, I get a different result  even though the data sets appear to me to contain the exact same data values.

Negative 5052 pI have a big project at hand which involves a large amount of views and usercontrols.

Unfortunately the font inside the TextBox remains unchanged, this is due to it receiving its FontFamily property from its base class Control. Control adds itself as an Owner of the TextElement FontFamilyProperty but specifies its own metadata which we are then unable to override.p  pIt also suggests to create a control template, which then sets the fontFamily. Is there another way I want to set the fontFamily programmatically at the start without using XAML or creating a controlTemplate and using it as a base template for every textBox. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5052 pI have a bit of an odd questionp  pWhich is faster... reading a series of files from the drive, or splitting them using split Reason Im asking is because Im aware that split is rather slow and Im wanting to switch to using substring instead.p  pBut the only way substring can work is if my data is padded in such a uniform way. For examplep  precode123,45,99,750 lt could be split by commas using split, but its slow. Or, the following line could be split with substring, every 10 digits 0000000123000000004500000000990000000750  codepre  pBoth these methods above will provide me with the same data. However, the substring will be about 4x faster than the split, since it doesnt have to search for commas.p  pHowever my concern is with the leading zeros that I must add to my data to make substring work. In some cases Ill have to have as many as 9 zeros to the left side of every number using PadLeft, to make all numbers be exactly 10 digits long.p  pThe result is that my files will be larger, which will result in an additional burden on the hard drive to read those files. Which takes me back to my original question which is faster, HHD reading, or splitp  pIts my understanding that a big portion of hard drive delay is the seek time. But that seek time is going to be no different whether I have zeros or not. The question is, after the hard drive has found the file, is the actual reading speed of the file slower or faster than the speed the processormemory can split the filep  pIf the additional burden on the HHD caused the zeros is going to slow it down more than using split would, then I should stick with using split. p

Negative 5052 pI am working on a simulation of poker and now I have to rank hands effectively p  pEvery hand is a combination of 5 cards and is represented as an codeuint64tcode.br Every bit from 0 Ace of Spades, 1 Ace of Hearts to 51 Two of Clubs indicates if the corresponding card is part bit  1 or isnt part bit  0 of the hand.

Negative 5052 pI am currently working on a project for which there exists both a mobile app and a web site. One task can be performed on either the web site meant for desktop users or the app. Right now, the requested functionality for the site is as followsp  ol liIf a desktop user visits the web page, continue on that page as usual.li liIf a mobile user visits the web page, redirect them to the installed mobile app.li ol  pI have already implemented logic to tell whether the user is on a desktop or mobile device most of the time, at least however, it occurred to me that some users may not have the app installed, or that a desktop device could be incorrectly identified as a mobile device in the future. If a computer that does not have the app installed is redirected, they will encounter some error or an aboutblank page. So, my question is, strongis there any way to tell whether a Response.Redirect to a mobile app will succeedstrongp  pSo far I have investigated the HttpWebRequestHttpWebResponse option to try and determine success or failure based on a requested page response prior to the redirect, but this does not seem like a valid option since a URL linked to an app will not provide a valid URI for the HttpWebRequest to test with. Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank youp  pFor clarification, the redirect looks something like thisp  precodeResponse.RedirectopencustomappSomePageParameter1barampParameter2foo codepre  pThe expected result is not to open a web page, but rather to interact with an app installed on the users phone which has been mapped to this url.p  pEDIT I have accepted the answer that it does not seem possible to do what I was asking for, but in case others have this problem, I wanted to attach some useful links to other questions about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15621641iosurlredirectfrommailtoapphow to use a cookie to determine if the app is installeda and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1108693isitpossibletoregisterahttpdomainbasedurlschemeforiphoneappslike11092001109200how to redirect the user to some other place if the cookie is not seta. For my own code, I will probably be going with a combination of a useragent check and the setTimeout function, as this can be implemented from codebehind using ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript without requiring any changes to the existing app.p

Negative 5052 pI am trying to follow rails casts episode 228 on polling for changes.  I am essentially following the screencast word for word, except that I am using it for notifications instead of comments.  The only difference is that every time he uses the word comment, i use the word usernotification.  Every time he uses the word comments, I use usernotifications.  Also, in the screencast comments belongsto articles, whereas in my app usernotifications belongsto user, so I replace the word article with currentuser.  I was able to setup the usernotifications successfully, except for that the newest notifications appear at the bottom.  I fixed this by adding a .order to usernotifications in the show.html.erb file see below.  The problem is that since the javascript is telling it to poll for all usernotifications with an id  params[after] see the index action in the controller below, it reappends the usernotifications with a higher id since the order was reversed.  How do I fix this  p  pHere is my code brbrp  pusernotifications.js.coffeep  precodeUserNotificationPoller    poll gt     setTimeout request, 5000    request gt     .getusernotifications.dataurl, after .usernotification.last.dataid  jQuery gt   UserNotificationPoller.poll codepre  pshow.html.erbp  precodelt contenttag div, id usernotifications, data url usernotificationsurl do gt     lt render currentuser.usernotifications.ordercreatedat desc gt lt end gt codepre  pindex.js.erbp  precodeusernotifications.appendlt j renderusernotifications gt UserNotificationPoller.poll codepre  pusernotificationscontrollerp  precodedef index     usernotifications  currentuser.usernotifications.whereid gt , params[after].toi end codepre

Negative 5052 pI have long struggled with how best to deal with warnings for implicit type coercions in C.p  pLets start off with a nonexhaustive list of examples. Compilers tend to vary widely in how pedantic they are.p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]       Truncation from const int to float      float a  16777217      Potential loss of sign in conversion from int to unsigned int      unsigned int b  1      Conversion from int to char, possible loss of data      int c  1     char d  c      Conversion from int to unsigned char, possible loss of data      uint16t e  1     uint8t f  e gtgt 8      Pointer targets in initialization differ in signedness      unsigned int g  ampargc      Initialization from incompatible pointer type technically an error      const char const h  argv      Different volatile qualifiers      const volatile char i  argv     strleni      Generates a warning in an old embedded C compiler. No offhand reference.      char j  malloc1     return 0  codepre  pIn principle these are beneficial and often reveal real bugs. The problem is that once discovered my strategy for acknowledging them has generally either been through overspecified typecasts, a cure worse than the disease if ever there was one, or by reducing the warning level or selectively disabling particularly common warnings through pragmas. The latter remedy is of course not possible if youre forced to work under draconian coding standards, such as MISRA C.p  pMore advanced static analysis tools generally offer some mechanism for indicating falsepositives which C compilers rarely seem to, and in any event such warning numbers are far from portable.p  pWhat is the recommended bestpractice herep  pI think I want something along the lines of constcast in C, plus unsignedcast, demotioncast, volatilecast and what have you.p  pLastly I apologize if this has already been asked, I imagine it has but was only able to find questions dealing with specific warnings rather the overarching problem.p

Negative 5052 pI have a small wordpress site that was hosted on a VPS and I decided to cancel the VPS a few days before the expiration and move to a cheaper provider as the blog was not getting a lot of visitors. p  pHowever because I did my backups in a hurry, I accidentally backed up the MySQL table instead of the actual wordpress table in MySQL. When I decided to restore the site yesterday, I noticed that and unfortunately my previous VPS has passed the expiration and my old provider confirmed that once the VPS is destroyed, they can no longer restore the data.p  pI do have the entire backup of the wordpress folder and my understanding is that the MySQL table is mostly just storing the settings and user info for Wordpress. So I was thinking if I could do a fresh install of Wordpress and populate the table in my new MySQL DB, and then replace everything by the backup copy of wordpress folder that I have, I should be able to get everything to work.p  pHowever when I tried that, I ended up having a blank page and nothing else. My PHP log werent giving any error either.p  pAny suggestionp
Negative 5052 pI have a Windows Mobile application that uses SQL Server CE 3.5.  When a handheld requests a System Update, it receives an .SDF file thats generated on a Windows Server.  This system has been running on a Win 2003 server for several years without any problems.p  pIm migrating the server processes from the Win 2003 server to a Win 2008 R2 server and have run into a problem.  After receiving the .SDF file from the new 64 bit server, the handheld takes more than 20 seconds to open a connection to it.  Opening a connection to the .SDF built on the 32bit Win 2003 server is virtually instantaneous.  My experimenting has shown that the problem occurs whenever the .SDF is built on a 64bit machine but does not occur if the .SDF is built on a 32 bit machine.p  pBy the way, only the first connection opening is slow.  Subsequent openings are instantaneous.  Does anyone know what I can do to fix thisp

The AuthenticationManagerImpl considers them in order, finding a CredentialToPrincipalResolver which               supports the presented credentials.                           AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers for two purposes.  First, it uses them to identify the Principal              attempting to authenticate to CAS login .  In the default configuration, it is the DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver              that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace              DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are              using.                           Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket.               In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose.               You will need to change this list if you are identifying services by something more or other than their callback URL.             gt         ltproperty namecredentialsToPrincipalResolversgt             ltlistgt                 lt                      UsernamePasswordCredentialsToPrincipalResolver supports the UsernamePasswordCredentials that we use for login                       by default and produces SimplePrincipal instances conveying the username from the credentials.                                            If youve changed your LoginFormAction to use credentials other than UsernamePasswordCredentials then you will also                      need to change this bean declaration or add additional declarations to declare a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the                      Credentials you are using.                     gt                 ltltbean classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.UsernamePasswordCredentialsToPrincipalResolver gt                     ltproperty nameattributeRepository refattributeRepository gt                 ltbeangtgt                 ltbean       classorg.jasig.cas.adaptors.ldap.BindLdapAuthenticationHandlergt       ltproperty namefilter valueuidu gt       ltproperty namesearchBase valueDCMINISTER,DCFR gt        ltproperty          namecontextSource          refcontextSource gt      ltbeangt                  lt                      HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver supports HttpBasedCredentials.

If you are representing services by something more or other than an HTTPS URL whereat they are able to                      receive a proxy callback, you will need to change this bean declaration or add additional declarations.                     gt                 ltbean                     classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver gt             ltlistgt         ltpropertygt    lt     Config CAS with LDAP     gt     ltbean idcontextSource classorg.jasig.cas.adaptors.ldap.util.AuthenticatedLdapContextSourcegt   ltproperty nameanonymousReadOnly valuefalse gt   ltproperty namepooled valuetruegt   ltproperty nameurlsgt      ltlistgt     ltvaluegtldap192.168.0.88389ltvaluegt       ltlistgt   ltpropertygt   ltproperty nameuserDn valueDCMINISTER,DCFRgt   ltproperty namegroupDn valueDCMINISTER,DCFRgt   ltproperty namepassword valueuserPasswordgt   ltproperty namebaseEnvironmentPropertiesgt      ltmapgt     ltentrygt              ltkeygtltvaluegtjava.naming.security.protocolltvaluegtltkeygt              ltvaluegtsslltvaluegt      ltentrygt     ltentrygt      ltkeygt       ltvaluegtjava.naming.security.authenticationltvaluegt      ltkeygt      ltvaluegtsimpleltvaluegt     ltentrygt      ltmapgt   ltpropertygt  ltbeangt  codepre  pand also  I make in strongpom.xmlstrong  p  precodeltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.jasig.casltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtcasserversupportldapltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt3.5.2ltversiongt  ltdependencygt  codepre  pand I make in strongapachetomcat7.0.47webappscasserverwebapp3.5.2WEBINFlibstrongp  pcasserversupportldap3.5.2.jarp  pbut when I start cas server I have this error p  precode           ...

Negative 5052 pOk so I was asked to do a 2d graph calculator as a college project, I was able to do one using java swing components and rendering an array with x,y values at real time. However there are several problems with this approachp  ol liThe array has a limit to the amount of values it can hold.li liIts not very good in terms of performance because it has to loop through the whole array at 60 fps or so.li ol  pMy way of fixing the first problem would be to use a dynamic array list instead of a regular array, but there is still the second problem. The idea of rendering one big image and using it as a map of the graph sounds like a solution however this then brings its own complications likep  ol liWhat happens when the field of view goes out of the image boundaries.li liHow to know what values of the graph it should render to the image.li ol  pNow then again I face another decision making, since now we are talking more advance graphics tricks I had the idea of using lwjgl as my graphics library instead of swing which made sense from the word go, so now I can use the 3d camera system to render an orthogonal view of the 2d graph. About the first problem I thought of making chunks of image so that when we leave the FOV there is still an image to see. About the second problem am stuck, because the graph works as a function of x I dont know what my y value is until the equation has been calculated so technically I could check if the y value reaches the bottom of the image and if its lower that the top of the image however this is still not good for performance.p  pNow say I have resolved all of the above there is still one last problem, and that is because I draw the graph as very little lines two points, how do I know how small the line have to be in order to get an accurate graph yet optimized, even when the function has some really wacky resultsp  pThank to everyone, and I hope you can help me p

Maximize the RibbonBar automatically on Startup ltEventSubscriptionShellCreated, ThreadOption.UserInterfacegt  Public Sub OnShellCreatedByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs     System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendF1   End Sub codepre  pI tried adding mShellUIExtensionService.ShowRibbonTrue to the above OnShellCreated function but the ribbon bar remains hidden still.p  pI suspect the problem lies in the order that the CAB architecture is loaded, so strongdoes anyone know how to set a property loaded by CAB after the application is loaded  Or at least know how I can work around this issuestrongp
Negative 5052 pIm fairly new to java and at this point in my life, a hobbiest when it comes to programming so this question might be a bit silly but here goes  Im trying to decide if a java app I create should be tightly integrated to the database teir or much more losely coupled.  p  pSay for example, i have a database i want to connect to and get some data from then i want to do somethign with that data like display it in an app or use it for some other purpose.  Should i do my db conneciton and querying in my main method of the class im writing or should i instead create a class that works to get the data that returns a resultset that ill then work with  p  pI assume the latter but it would also seem to create some complexity which would be a bit of a pain to work with or at least given what little i know it would be a pain.  For instance in the example below, if i have a problem getting results, im relying on the DataAccessor class to log the issue.  Is that how that woudl typically be done or should i pass that back up to the main class by somehow getting the error message artificially into the return value or should i instead pass the error back using throws or should i use something entirely different  Ultimately, i guess im thinking i have a dataccessor layer which would do the selecting and the inserting and the updating so that the main class is workign with a disconnected data set and the DataAccessor class handles the details of connecting to, querying, and updating the database.  Is this the best approachp  pthanks, ShermanTheCatp  precode Class TheMainClass      main           DataAccessor myDA  new DataAccessorbob, bobspassord, 127.0.0.1...

Negative 5052 pI have a use case where I want to have a globally distributed lock.  We started out using codeSELECT .. FOR UPDATEcode, but that quickly started to have problems as we scaled up the number of servers.  Also it didnt account for processes that checked out the lock and then died and failed to return the lock.  p  pWe need to be able to set an expiration on the lock i.e. if the process who checked out the lock does not return it in 2 hours, the lock is automatically returned to the pool. I realize that this introduces the issue where we are ignoring locks, but we are fairly certain that the process has died if not complete in 2 hours.  Also the job is idempotent, so if it is done more than once its not a big deal.p  pIve looked through a number of distributed locking systems and come across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1059580distributedlockservicethis questionsa that have been extremely helpful.  All of the solutions extend off of Javas codejava.util.concurrency.locks.Lockcode, which actually may be the issue Im coming across because that interface doesnt have the expiration feature I need.  We have a similar strategy to a hrefhttpsgithub.comdeftlabsmongojavadistributedlock relnofollowmongojavadistributedlocka where we use MongoDBs a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencecommandfindAndModify relnofollowfindAndModifya.  Were consideringp  ul lia hrefhttpsgithub.comdeftlabsmongojavadistributedlock relnofollowmongojavadistributedlockali lia hrefhttpsgithub.commrnikoredisson relnofollowRedissonali lia hrefhttpwww.hazelcast.com relnofollowhazelcasta li ul  pas our distributed locking mechanism all happen to implement codejava.util.concurrency.locks.Lockcode.p  pThe biggest problem is that because codejava.util.concurrency.locks.Lockcode doesnt have an option for expiring a lock, these dont fit all the goals.  This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1062441311525answera probably gets closest with hazelcast, but it is reliant on an entire server failing, not just a thread taking too long. Another option is possibly using a Samaphore with hazelcast as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19767328inhazelcastisitpossibletouseclusteredlocksthatdonotcareabuttherq1herea.  I could have a reaper thread that is then able to cancel the locks of others if they are taking too long.  With Mongo and Redis I could take advantage of their ability to expire objects, but that doesnt seem to be part of either of the libraries since they just implement codejava.util.concurrency.locks.Lockcode in the end.p  pSo this was just a long winded way of asking, is there a distributed locking mechanism out there that I can have automatically expire after N seconds  Should I be looking at a different mechanism than codejava.util.concurrency.locks.Lockcode in this situation altogetherp

Is there any way to share cookie other way i.e, soon as cookie is set on one tab, the other tab can use it, without need to being refreshed p  pAnother post at SO said, codeone must continuesly poll cookie, in order to sharecode. but i couldnt understand, what they mean by codepollcode. can this empollem thing help in my casep

On the java server side my servlet check if the user is allowed to upload files and if not send back a successfalse or what ever. The curious thing is that the progress bar is still progressing like if the server will upload it and I got only the error when the progress is finish. That is really strange my expectation was that the progress will not start or should be canceled on error returned. For sure I could check the user right before starting sending but I did a second an put a wrong URL in the ajax for which there is no end point and it still showing the progression until the end which if it is a big file take a while and sometimes freeze the browser.  Is there a way to stop the progression earlier as the and of the progress on server error. Would be great to find a solution after a couple of hours googling not founding someone having the same issue Regards JPp

Negative 5052 pI have been asked to make some changes to an application that uses nhibernate as an ORM.p  pThe application is divided into two components  a client and a server.p  pThe server consists of a number of domain class definitions for each table in the DB and a corresponding hbm.xml file for each class.p  pI just have a basic question right now. If I want to add another table to the database will it be sufficient to add just another class definition and hbm.xml file defining the properties and primary keys in both.p  pI have tried this by creating a TestTable.cs and a TestTable.hbm.xml file. But after running the server the table TestTable is not created.p  pI have not used nhibernate and this is a basic question.p  pHow do I add tables to the existing DB given that I have an existing application with app 50 tables with classes and hbm.xml files defined for eachp  pThanks in advancep  pEdit on 206p  pI think I have not been able to explain my question properly. Let me explain the scenario once again.p  ol liI have a live DB with app 50 tablesli liI have a data layer that contains POCO classes for each of these 50 tablesli liI want to generate another table in the DB by adding another POCO class without dropping and recreating the existing tables.li ol  pPoint no 3 above is very important. I am given to understand that in this case I need to use SchemaUpdate and not SchemaExport. Is this correctp  pThe problem is that I have tried using SchemaUpdate and it did not work for me.

Negative 5052 pI am having a problem getting an Android DrawerLayout to close.p  pIn my implementation I am using a LinearLayout rather than a listView. The list view implementation is the one commonly be found in most of the tutorials and discussed on this site.p  pIn my implementation I want to use the same DrawerLayout on all activities  of my application. For that reason all of the XML layout files I use an include to cut down the amount of code one needs to store.p  pThe functionality of the drawer and its buttons is exactly as I want them to be. The draw slides open on a swipe, closes on a swipe and all buttons respond with the appropriate functionality. However, I cannot get the drawer to close programmatically by calling any of the following. It simply has no effect. p  precodedrawerLayout.closeDrawers         drawerLayout.closeDrawerGRAVITYSTART drawerLayout.closeDrawerdrawerLinearLayout codepre  pI tried a few variants on this like calling the whole DrawLayout object from the veiw to no avail, I tried different gravity options.

Negative 5052 pIm impressed by the speed of running transformations, loading data and ease of use of codePandascode and want to leverage all these nice properties amongst others to model some largeish data sets 100200k rows, lt20 columns. The aim is to work with the data on some computing nodes, but also to provide a view of the data sets in a browser via codeFlaskcode.p  pIm currently using a Postgres database to store the data, but the import coming from csv files of the data is slow, tedious and error prone and getting the data out of the database and processing it is not much easier. The data is never going to be changed once imported no CRUD operations, so I thought its ideal to store it as several pandas codeDataFramecode stored in hdf5 format and loaded via pytables.p  pThe question isp  p1 Is this a good idea and what are the things to watch out for For instance I dont expect concurrency problems as codeDataFramecodes are should be stateless and immutable taken care of from applicationside. What else needs to be watched out forp  p2 How would I go about caching the data once its loaded from the hdf5 file into a codeDataFramecode, so it doesnt need to be loaded for every client request at least the most recentfrequent dataframes. codeFlaskcode or codewerkzeugcode has a codeSimpleCachingcode class, but, internally, it pickles the data and unpickles the cached data on access. I wonder if this is necessary in my specific case assuming the cached object is immutable. Also, is such a simple caching method usable when the system gets deployed with Gunicorn is it possible to have static data the cache and can concurrent different process requests access the same cache.p  pI realise these are many questions, but before I invest more time and build a proofofconcept, I thought I get some feedback here. Any thoughts are welcome.p

Negative 5052 pI need to implement a way of recording an UDP stream with the purpose of later on replaying that stream as requested. This record and replay must use the same timing up to a sensible resolution, hardly perceivable by a human user, lets say 10ms if the original stream had data for seconds 0000 to 0035, then went mute till 0055, and then sent more data from 0055 to 0134, the same distribution must be observed when my application replays that stream.p  pIf it were just a matter of saving the udp stream to disk and then replaying it, without this timing, it would be trivial by either using Socket, NetworkStream or UdpClient. The issue is I cannot get around to devise a way to modify the standard receive algorithm to include that timing in a way that its somehow easily replayed later by the send algorithm. As a bonus, a way to start the replay at any time mark from 0015 on, for example should also be supported.p  p1 Is there any way to easily implement this functionality on C We do not have any severe nonfunctional requirement for this, we just need for it to simply work. Any hint about a way to implement it would be really appreciated.p  p2 If this is indeed not a simple matter and anyone suggests the use of any thirdparty component for this, the requirements would be for it to have an API for C or a way to operate the component from code, and hopefully be opensource or freely used software.p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 5052 pI wrote an implementation of Dijkstras algorithm based on the pseudocode for it on Wikipedia  a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDijkstra relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDijkstraasalgorithm   that used a priority queue with a minheap. The graph was represented with an adjacency matrix just like the pseudo code. And when I was gonna test it to see the running time, I thought I needed some large graphs to test on, so I randomly generated a few graphs of some size n although the method I used to generate the graphs was probably quite bad. p  pNow, the complexity for this implementation is according to Wikipedia OVE log V.p  pWhen I ran the algorithm on V  1000, e.g. a graph with 1000 nodes I dont know how many edges though, on average it took about 800 ms. When I doubled the size of the graph with V  2000, it took around 1700 ms, and when I doubled that V  4000, it took about twice as much. p  pSo my question is I know that my computer plays some part in the time measurements as well, shouldnt the running times be faster Are these measurements reasonable p

Negative 5052 pI am using codeSpring Securitycode 3.2.5.RELEASE. I try to achieve below scenariop  ol liI have two kind of users in my application regular user and adminli liI want to use codeSecuredcode annotation on controller methods annotated with codeRequestMappingcodeli liMethods which are not annotated with codeSecuredcode I want to be accessible for all even anonymous users.li liMethods which are annotated with codeSecuredcode are permited for regular users if they have specific role passed to codeSecuredcode annotation. These methods should be also always permited for admin users but I dont want to put codeROLEADMINcode on every time when I use codeSecuredcode annotation.li ol  pThis is my HttpSession configurationp  precodeOverride     protected void configureHttpSecurity http throws Exception          http             .authorizeRequests                 .antMatchers                 .permitAll      [...]       codepre  pI can annotate my controller methods with codeSecuredcode annotation and it works. The only problem is how I can add urlintercept matcher for permitting all users which has role codeROLEADMINcode before access rules collected from codeSecuredcode annotatated methods. For now it looks like codeSecuredcode methods are first in filter chain and rules added to codeHttpSessioncode in code above are last. How can I add rule that will be first for codeROLEADMINcode permision and last for all methods not annotated with codeSecuredcode permision, and all rules from codeSecuredcode annotations will be wrapped by these two rules To be more clear, I want to achieve something like this in chainp  precode1 allow all for users with ROLEADMIN 2 all rules from Secured 3 allow methods not annotated with Secured for all codepre

Negative 5052 pIm trying to optimize some code originally written in Fortran.p  pThe algorithm involves operating on a large array 27 million cells over several iterations. Each cell can be evaluated independently during one iteration. However, the iterations cannot be parallelized because the calculation done at t1 depends on the results of the calculation done at t.p  pA rough, simplified nonparallel pseudocode examplep  precodefor t0 tlttmax t  A  A  B  B   B  A 2  codepre  pwhere A and B are big arrays.p  pCurrently, Ive implemented this by calling EnqueueNDRangeKernel out of a loop in the host C code. Because I need the results of the previous iteration, I am writing into global memory each time.p  pDoing 27 million global memory writes per iteration kills my performance. I have two kernel versions Im playing around with compared to Fortran, version 1 is 2.5x faster version 2 is 4x faster. p  pIve tried fiddling around with the algorithm, as well as doing stuff with pointers version 2. p  pMy question is as follows is there any way to avoid this global memory write chokepointp  pThanksp  hr  pRequested codep  pCall in Cp  precodeNDRange globalnxp1nynz NDRange localnz      for w0 wlt100 w             queue.enqueueNDRangeKernelkernA, NullRange, global, local         queue.enqueueBarrierWithWaitList        queue.enqueueNDRangeKernelkernB, NullRange, global, local       queue.finish codepre  pKernelsp  precodekernel void kernAglobal double A, global double B          int i  getglobalid0      double Al     Al  A[i]     double Bl     Bl  B[i]      Al  Al  Bl      A[i]  Al if this line is removed, everything goes much faster.           kernel void kernBglobal double A, global double B          int i  getglobalid0      double Al     Al  A[i]     double Bl     Bl  B[i]      Bl  Bl  Al2      B[i]  Bl if this line is removed, everything goes much faster.      codepre  pIve simplified the kernel code for the sake of clarifying the algorithm.

Negative 5052 pI have created a PHP file which is set to read the contents of a local text file, parse into an array, and then populate a table within the main page. However, even just 53 lines of this text file takes around 10 seconds to load the page before any content is displayed.p  pI understand that this is a limitation where the server needs to create the entire html file before sending it to clients, and this generation takes time depending on the size of the content to generate from, meaning this 10 seconds will likely increase with more lines to process. The end product will have well over 500 lines to process, so this will take minutes to generate, and then send to the client.p  pI was wondering if I could bypass this, send the client a small html file holding an empty table, and then start to fill and populate this table using PHP, but I am unsure of how to go about this. Would I call an include to a separate php file which will call the generation code, or get the server to stream the content one table row at a timep  pThe page in question is a hrefhttpzionfox.netcards.php relnofollowhttpzionfox.netcards.phpa. The current load time takes around 710 seconds, and Id like to decrease this by only loading the core table, then displaying the table rows as they are generated by the source.p  pEdit There is a reason for the larger images too When zooming in on mobile devices, Id rather the images be as crisp and sharp as the fonts alongside. I tried with actual size images 20px and they became almost unreadable when zoomed in. I realise that .png is probably not the best format to use, but its my first time on using codefileputcontentscode and Im not entirely sure of the source files image, nor making sure the images retain transparency.p  pEdit Edit The source to the file is a hrefhttpzionfox.netcards.php.txt relnofollowhttpzionfox.netcards.php.txta  Please excuse the scruffiness of the code, its still heavily work in progress and I wanted to get it working first before tidying the code.p  pThe file is split into an array separated by characters using codeexplodecode. Each of these arrays are then split into further arrays using more codeexplodecodes and then each part of this array is processed to see if criteria match, and return the correct results based on the values, including, pulling images from external sources if I dont already have the image. This is all then codeechocodeed out at the bottom of the for loop to create a new table row, then it repeats the process for the next line.p  hr  pThanks to Tenhsor, the solution to thisp  precodehandle  fopenpathToFile, r ifobgetlevel  0 obstart  ifhandle      whileline  fgetshandle  false          echo row . ltbr gt         The code you want to process          obflush         flush       obendflush fclosehandle codepre  pFull solution found in their response.p  pI also want to add, this code alone didnt solve my issue.

Negative 5052 pI am developing an Android app which supports Talkback and Explore By Touch but have run into issues when responding to two fingered scrolling with a custom view.p  pAs I understand it, holding two fingers on the screen and moving them around should generate the same sequence of touch events at the custom views onTouchEvent method as using a single finger with TalkbackExplore By Touch switched off. p  pIm expecting to see an ACTIONDOWN event when the user touches the screen with two fingers, followed by a series of ACTIONMOVE events and finally an ACTIONUP event when they stop touching the screen.p  pThis happens sometimes, but quite often, upon placing two fingers on the screen I receive a volley of events which are difficult to interpret correctly.p  pIn order to discount as much code as possible, Ive written a simple sample app which is just a basic Android app created with the ADT wizard featuring a single custom view declared as followsp  precodepackage com.example.accesseventtest  import android.content.Context import android.util.AttributeSet import android.util.Log import android.view.MotionEvent import android.view.View  public class AccessTestView extends View       public AccessTestViewContext context, AttributeSet attrs          supercontext, attrs          TODO Autogenerated constructor stub           Override     public boolean onTouchEventMotionEvent event              int actiontype  event.getActionMasked          if actiontype  MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE             Log.donTouchEvent, event.toString          return true       codepre  pThe custom view is intended to consume all touch events that are passed through and returns true to indicate this, it also copies all events to the debug log except for ACTIONMOVE to reduce the amount of debug log produced.

Negative 5052 pI am trying to build a drawing app which also allows the user to pinch zoom and pan around, drawing on the pinched view.p  pI have built the drawing app using touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and TouchesEnded. I have added pinchGestureRecognizer to the app along with  CGAffineTransform transform to create the pinch zoom.  This has a problem in that when I finish with the pinch zoom going back to the original size and start to draw again, the drawings get increasingly smaller as I draw.  I have tried to assign the drawing to one view and the pinch to another view that is resized depending on if I am drawing or pinching.  But the same thing keeps happening. why would the drawing view inherit the zoomView pinch action  If anyone has any suggestions or has done this before let me know.p  pI couldnt figure out how to get this to work so I removed the pinch gesture and added a UISlider to create the zoom in and out.  Now everything seems to be working ok in this department anyway.p

Negative 5052 pThis may be a self answering question, but Im hoping one of you could point me to any resource where it is declared, or can be inferred, whether to use upper or lower case letters when declaring a HTTP method name in HTTP or REST requests. The majority of examples I see put GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH etc in capital letters, whereas I go on the assumption that HTTP method field names are case insensitive  that is, for example, that get is equally as valid as GET. Traditionally I have always used capital letters, but I would just like to be sure. p  pThe a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec5.htmlsec5.1.1 relnofollowW3Ca explicitly declares that the method is casesesnsitive and uses upper case, but in my travails, Ive often encountered HTTP method field values using lower case, which I assume are incorrect, so from my POV, it seems that practices and standards are somewhat out of touch on this matter.p  pUppercase is correct rightp

Negative 5052 pI normally use WebStorm spinoff of IntelliJ IDEA, which has a wonderful search everywhere feature.  I use this for finding files, types, and especially commands.p  pIm just starting to use Resharper in Visual Studio 2012, and its sometimes hard to find the commands Im looking for.  I was hoping to find a search everywhere feature, but I looked through all the Resharper menu items, and couldnt find any.p  pIs there any sort of search everywhere for Resharper  Im hoping to find an easy way to search through the list of commands like refactorings, navigations, etc.p

Negative 5052 pI have a function that continuously takes screenshots of an UI element to then draw it itself. The UI element can change, so I take a screenshot in very short intervals to not have the second drawing lag behind please dont question this and just assume that redrawing it is the right way. The use case is a bit more complicated.p  pHowever, taking the screenshot and invalidating the previous drawing to redraw it is quite an expensive operation, and most often not needed as the UI element doesnt update that often. Is there a way to detect when a UI element changes in such a way that it needs redrawing, including when it happens to one of its subviews One solution would be to copy the state and the states of all its descendents and then check that, but that doesnt seem like a good solution either. iOS must know internally when it needs to redrawupdate the views, is there any way to hook into this Note that I tagged this codeUIKitcode and codeCoreAnimationcode, I suppose the way to go for this is CoreAnimation, but Im open for a solution that uses either of these.p

Negative 5052 pI am trying to detect an object in the frames received from camera on an android device, using OpenCV.p  pRight now I am stuck because of the lack of tutorials and examples.

Also a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsintroductionandroidbinarypackagedevwithOCVonAndroid.html relnofollowHerea is the famous original tutorialp  pAnyway, how I see it, an app like this one should havep  ol liSome initialization part for the library, so OpenCV would be loaded when the app is startingli lionCameraFrame, I should do the object detecting, then if detected, I will Log the detection and move forward.li ol  pSo the test app runs just fine... My biggest problem so far is that on the display of my device I see an inverted image, not just filped but inverted, or maybe flipped horizontally and vertically, i cant really tell. But I do not request any flipping anywhere as far as I can see.

I removed my tablet from the USB connection and then reconnected it. Now the image is no longer inverted.p  pBut now, the image is not occupying all the screen, but it is centered, just like it would be a square...p  pStill, how do I prevent, or make sure that my final app wont start with my image inverted Is there a reason this happened I read already somewhere that some manufacturers of tablets have some kind of hardware bug that makes the image from the camera inverted... but with me it only happens sometimes... So the tablet I am using might not be among those buggy devices its a Samsung Tab2 GTP3100. So, still... something is not right with this. It never happened to me to turn the default camera on to take a photo and to find the image inverted...p

Negative 5052 pIve built this LSystem in Processing using toxiclib and I want to connect each point which is specified to each intersection in the branching of the tree. Ive written a separate sketch in which Im trying to create a triangle mesh by connecting the three closest points, Ive been able to connect three points but I want it to be able to go through all the Vertices in an arraylist and then connect three closest points until I have a mesh out of all the vertices in the array. I also need to be able to convert this whole sketch into a function where by I can feed it into my LSystem and then it will return the whole system with all the points connected in order to create a mesh.

Negative 5052 pI noticed SpringCloud ZUUL forces the execution isolation to SEMAPHORE instead of the THREAD defaults as recommended by Netflix.p  pA comment in codeorg.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.route.RibbonCommandcode saysp  blockquote   pwe want to default to semaphoreisolation since this wraps   2 others commands that are already thread isolatedp blockquote  pBut still I dont get it  What are those two other commandsp  pConfigured this way, Zuul can only sched load but does not allow for timing out and let the client walk away. In short, even if the Hystrix timeout is set to 1000ms, clients will only be released once the call forwarded to the service down the chain returns or timeouts because of a ReadTimeout for instance.p  pI tried to force THREAD isolation by overriding the configuration per service unfortunately, since the default is forced in the code and everything seems to work as expected. However, Im not keen in doing this without proper understanding of the implications  certainly in regards of the comment found in the code and the defaults adopted by the Spring Cloud version of Zuul.p  pCan someone provide more information Thxp

Negative 5052 pI have an app that downloads data from the internet using an AsyncTask. That information is then split and displayed in two ListViews, one in each of two fragments. Those fragments are inside a ViewPager so I can swipe between them.p  pThe problem is that now that I have two fragments, knowing when it is okay to have the AsyncTask call setAdapter on either fragments lists is tricky since they might not be created yet.p  pI used to only have one FragmentListViewListAdapter, which made this very easy because I could put the call to the AsyncTask in the Adapters constructor and know for sure the ListView is instantiated. I cant do that any more since now I have to wait for two ListViews to be created. p  pp  pMy solution was to use semaphores to signal when both were created, and use them to only allow the AsyncTask to try and set the adapters after the fragments were created.p  pThat seemed to work, but unfortunately Im still getting occasional force closes due to the ListViews still sometimes being null despite the semaphore suggesting they should have been created.p  pp  pThat leads to my question strongIs it possible for fragments in a ViewPager to not always be created, or to be created twice, or to be deleted after having been createdstrong Im having trouble figuring out what else might be causing this.p  pAlternatively, if someone has a suggestion as to a better way to approach this problem than using semaphores Im all ears.p

Negative 5052 pI have some questions about the strongimplementationstrong of variable initialization in C in regards to the linking and executable module loading process. My main concern is with dynamic initialization of global variables and static member variables, wherein the initialization process involves the execution of code. Im looking for the answer to address my questions for both Windows and Linux.p  pI already understand that in the case of static initializationp  pthe initial value is placed into its own section during compilation p  pthe sections are mapped into memory by the OS module loaderp  pthe variable is assigned the location of the initial values memory address with the application of a DIR32 type relocationp  pHere are my questions.p  ol lipWhat information does the compiler place into a generated object file relating to dynamic initialization of global variables for the linker to use Please go into as much detail as possible about related sections and generated symbols. What differences are there for static member variables compared to nonstatic global variablespli lipWhat information does the linker place into the final linked module during the linking process so that the OS module loader is able to correctly initialize all variables including dynamically initialized globalstatic member variables that make calls to functions as part of initialization  pli lipHow is the function that needs to be executed during dynamic variable initialization mapped to the particular variable that needs to be initialized with that codepli lipWhen an executable or dynamically linked module is loaded, how is dynamic initialization of variables performed  pli lipDoes the implementation of C11 constant expressions marked by the constexpr specifier involve any special considerations compared to the implementation of regular static member variables and functions pli ol  pI have a specific example case Im hoping the answer could refer to within the framework of the above questions, since I felt that having a concrete example of taking an object file, identifying the relevant sectionssymbols and how this particular code would be linked and loaded so that successful initialization of the static variable could be carried out would make the answer easier to understand. This example is for Windows using MSVC as the compiler please mention specific differences for gcclinux wherever they exist. p  pHere is a simple example of C code involving a regular variable and a static member variable which from my understanding needs to be dynamically initialized by the OS loader before strongmainstrong because it makes a call to a function as part of its initializationp

Negative 5052 pIve been having a difficult time thinking of the correct way to do this, so I figure Id ask.p  pIn an Android client, I am receiving 2 different JSONArrays from an API response. Many of the objects contained within the 2 arrays are the same but at different indices, as the arrays may be of different lengths  order.p  pI am storing the two arrays and depending on the tab a user selects, a listview shows one or the other, without the need to reload from the API.p  pNow to the question. If a user updates or modifies an object in one array, what is the best route to search the second array for that object, and if it exists, update it to match what had just been modified.p  pOne idea I had was to just iterate the second array and if the message contained the same unique identifier in this case, msgid from the API then update it. p  pI am concerned that with how much the users will interact with the listviews updating these objects, that normal iteration is inefficient. It should also be noted that the arrays are not huge by any magnitude, maybe 30kb.p  pThanks for any ideas Cheers.p

Negative 5052 pIve got a scatter plot with a horizontal and a vertical line, which depict thresholds values, and therefore they divide the plot into four quadrants. Id like to label the quadrants. I think the best way to do this would be a number in each of the four corners of the graph alternative suggestions are welcome. p  pIve managed to put a text into the corner of each quadrant, but the positions are not perfect. I assume that the problem has to do with the fact that the scaling of the axes is different the range of values is about the same, but the width of my figure is about three times the height.p  pCurrently I proceed the following way. First I create the graph with the points and the two lines, then I build it in order to get the range of the two axes, which I use in order to adjust the position of the texts. p  precodeplot.build  ggplotbuildplot  xpos  numeric4 xpos[2]  xpos[3]  plot.buildpanelranges[[1]]x.range[1] xpos[1]  xpos[4]  plot.buildpanelranges[[1]]x.range[2]  ypos  numeric4 ypos[1]  ypos[2]  plot.buildpanelranges[[1]]y.range[2] ypos[3]  ypos[4]  plot.buildpanelranges[[1]]y.range[1]   plot  plot  geomtextaesx2,y2,label  texthere,                      data.framex2xpos, y2ypos, textherec1, 2, 3, 4,                     color4daf4a, size4 codepre  pBasically this works, but due to the scaling the space between the numbers and the borders of the plot are not the same for both axes. Ive tried to adjust the x position of the text, but then ggplot just expands the range of values, the positions relative to the borders stay the same. Is there a way to move the text without changing the range of valuesp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5052 pIn the current ColladaLoader.js I dont see anything that reads or applies the Collada standards weighting value 0.01.0 that indicates bump intensity or bumpScale in Three.js Phong material.  I noticed that when I export my collada from Blender it picks up the bump materials instantly in three.js which is amazingly simple  YAY but my materials always get an exaggerated bumpScale of default 1.0.  It gives the materials an exaggerated bumpiness.p  pI managed to edit my ColladaLoader a bit and try out my ideal value 0.05 but wonder if Im missing something or doing this wrong  Anybody else try this  Note that Ive not had good luck with json exports so Im sticking with Collada for now.p  pThanksp
