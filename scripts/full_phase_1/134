Positive 134 pIve been working on trying to adapt the game crozzle to digital format. For those of you who dont know it is essentially a crossword game. My program takes a wordlist and based on difficulty it tries to calculate the best possible placement of words. However I cant seem to achieve that and thought that someone might be able to help out.Basically I want the most amount of words possible to archive the highest score.p  precodenamespace

Positive 134 pSo the question I have is very similar to this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32663989howdoyousorttwoarraysexactlythesameHow do you sort two arrays exactly the samea, except instead of having an array I use pointers. At the time of sorting, I do know the amount of elements in the arrays. p  pBasically, I just want an option thats better than copying everything from my pointerarray into a new array simply so I can use the solutions in the above thread, because that feels like a hackfix rather than a proper solution. Perhaps its possible to make an array with a fixed size from the pointer without having to copy all the elementsp

Positive 134 pThe following code sorts through a dictionary of words in lexicographical order. The problem is that I cannot access the sorted array outside of the for loop. Well I think this is the problem. I have declared the array words in another method and returned it to a private variable within the same class. But after I sort the array and try to print it out, it just prints out the original array. I also want to mention that this sorting method does work as I have tested it in another class where everything was in the main method. So again I believe my problem has to do with returning the new sorted array. I also need to write a few lines of code within the method after the array is sorted and when I tried to return the array, using return words I was unable to write this code.p  precodepublic void insertionSort  int in, out  for out1 outltnElems out     String temp  words[out]                                remove marked item     in  out                                                start shifting at out                      while ingt0 ampamp words[in1].compareTotempgt0           until temp is lexicographically after after the word it is being compared to         words[in]  words[in1]                             shifts word to next position in lexicographical order         in                                                             words[in]  temp  forint i0 i ltwords.length i     System.out.printlnwords[i] codepre

Positive 134 pI am doing a question on www.hackerrank.com and I have been stuck on it for days. p  pHere is the statement of the question a hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesinsertionsort relnofollowhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesinsertionsorta. Basically, I have to count how many swaps occur in insertion sort for a given array in Onlogn time. p  pa hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637144 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637144a Here is my submitted code. I use merge sort and count how many times each element is displaced. This code passes for more than half of the sites tests. When it fails it doesnt time out, and it doesnt have a compilation error or segmentation fault. p  pFurthermore, when I got the input for one of the failed test cases Here is the input that it failed on the site a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637165 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637165a and tested it with this variation of my code a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637127 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637127a which actually runs the insertion sort algorithm counting the number of swaps along the way and checks it against the merge sort count, I pass all of the tests. Also, I have generated thousands of random test cases, and they also all pass using this test. p  pI dont think its a problem on the sites end because in the discussions for the problem other people seem to be passing the tests just fine without any questions or complaints. So maybe I am misunderstanding either the question or I am simply writing both the algorithm and the test cases for the algorithm wrong. Does anyone have any suggestionsp
Positive 134 pIm developing an adminstration interface for a set of tables. I need to implement functionalities such as listing, sorting, filtering and pagination.p  pIm using Spring Boot as a starter and Spring Data Jpa for repository. Ive searched the Web for some examples about a complete solution that includes all the above functionalities. What I found included almost all of them, but appearently if there was pagination and sorting there wasnt filtering or viceversa.p  pNow Im storing the filter in a application object on session using codeModelAttributecode but I know that is now a good design because the applciation will extend and it becomes hard to maintain. Im also using codePagecode and codePaginationcode for pagination purpose and using codeSpecificationscode for filtering.p  pWhat I want is to submit all the data, i.e. search fields, sorted fields and current page, in a single request. Off course if the search fields are not empty the pagination will be reinitialize. p  pAnother thing is that I dont want to use jQuery  datatables but plain HTML and form submission.p  pHere are some tutorials and examples that I foundp  pa hrefhttpspringinpractice.com20120511paginationandsortingwithspringdatajpa relnofollowLink 1ap  pa hrefhttpwww.petrikainulainen.netprogrammingspringframeworkspringdatajpatutorialpartsevenpagination relnofollowLink 2ap  pThanks in advancep

Secondly, every form that posts will have the keycookie combo.p  pMy question is, what would be the easiest way to implement this in an ASP.NET MVC web applicationp  pNot to answer my own question, but here are my initial thoughtsp  pRight now my controllers all inherit from a base controller, so my first thought was to override the OnActionExecuted method to check for the existence of the required form field, and from there if it finds it, verify it against the cookie and either allow the post to continue or kick it to some error page.p  pFor the form portion I was thinking of generating my own html extension methods like...  Html.BeginSecureForm that overloads all of the same methods as BeginForm In case i need them but auto generates the Pseudorandom key and cookie and places the cookie and the form field inside the form IF ITS A POST automagically.p  pSorry, if this is kind of jumbled up, I have notes scattered throughout these pages and Im trying to organize them.

After a while Matrix i  a  b codepre  pstrongWhat I had yesterdaystrongp  pAt the moment I overloaded the two operators codeoperatorcode and codeoperatorcode and until yesterday night the were defined in this wayp  precodeMatrixamp operatorMatrixamp m Matrixamp operatorMatrixamp m codepre  pThe operator instantiates a new Matrix object codeMatrix return  new Matrix...code on the heap, set the values and then justp  precodereturn result codepre  pstrongWhat I have todaystrongp  pAfter the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions475888willthisleadtoamemoryleakincdiscussiona I decided to implement it in a different way to avoid the user to be bothered bother by pointers of any type and to keep the usage unchanged. The different way is to pass the returning value of operator by valuep  precodeMatrix operatorMatrixamp m Matrixamp operatorMatrixamp m codepre  pThe operator instantiates codereturncode on the stack, set the values and then return the object.p  pThere is a problem with this approach it doesnt work. The operator expects a Matrixamp and operator returns a Matrix. Moreover this approach doesnt look so good to me for another reason Im dealing with matrices, that can be very large and the aims of this library were to be 1 good enough for my project 2 fast, so probably passing by value should not be an option.p  pstrongWhich solutions I have exploredstrongp  pWell, following the suggestions in the previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions475888willthisleadtoamemoryleakincdiscussiona I read some stuff about smart pointers, they look great but I cant still figure out how to solve my problem with them. They deal with memory freeing and pointer copying, but Im basicly using references, so they dont look the right choice for me. But I may be wrong.p  pMaybe the only solution is to pass by value, maybe I cant get both efficiency and a good interface. But again, youre the expert, and I would like to know your opinion.p
Negative 134 pIm having a problem passing strings that exceed 80 characters in JSON. When I pass a string thats exactly 80 characters long it works like magic. But once I add the 81st letter it craps out. Ive tried looking at the json object in firebug and it seems to think the string is an array because it has an expander next to it. Clicking the expander though does nothing. Ive tried searching online for caps on JSON string sizes and work arounds but am coming up empty . Anybody know anything about thisp  peditp  pIt actually doesnt matter what the string is... using abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz yields the same results.p  pHeres my code Im using pythonp  presult  test abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz self.response.out.writesimplejson.dumpsresultp  pwould you happen to know the class that encodes strings properly for python Thanks so much p

Negative 134 pIve been doing research on reporting suites for a project my company is about to undertake, and have narrowed the candidates down to Active Reports and Crystal Reports.  p  pDuring the demo yesterday, it was clarified to me that one of the capabilities our client would like is the ability for the enduser to create custom reports integrated into the WebBased client.  I know that both packages have options for integrating an enduser designer to a WinForms based app, but I cant find a definitive straight yes or no answer for either suite as to whether or not its possible to attach them to an ASP.Net based app.p  pMy instinct is no, but I was hoping somebody with more experience in reporting suites could give me a solid yes or no.p

Negative 134 pNote that this is not about the .NET CLR that Microsoft is thrusting into the atmosphere to evangelize the concept of managed code. Most of you know that managed code has been around for quite some time and isnt very related to rocket science.p  pWhat I would like to know is strongwhy the concept of runtime security in the evolution of computers came so latestrong. p  pI know this is like asking why didnt the first Model T Ford come with airbags and seat belts. The relevance of the question still stands despite this though, because its well within human nature to protect againts known dangers. E.g. the first TFord didnt go fast enough to motivate airbag research. It didnt go fast enough for people to make fatal judgemental errors so often that it would motivate seat belt as law and standard in many countries.p  pIn computer evolution its almost the other way around. We started out with assembler, the equivalent of driving a TFord at 200mph with an eyepatch. Ive had the pleasure of conversating with a few old truckers from this era, hearing these stories about handassembling assembly code, human debuggers, grillion lines of code etc. If we make a really nasty error in C, we might end up with a bluescreen. Decades ago, you could end up with damaged hardware and god knows what. But its a mystery to me  so many decades, and all we did to make crashing less painful was the bluescreen sorry for using MS as archetype for anything.p  pIts not only within human nature to protect against known dangers, strongits also within any programmers nature to automate and systemize common facilitiesstrong, like error checking, memory diagnostics, logging frameworks, backup maintenance etc etc. p  pWhy didnt programmershumans start to automate the task of ensuring that code they feed to the system wont harm the system. Yes, ofcourse, emperformanceem. But hey, this was well before any seriously penetrating hardware standard. Why didnt motherboards get designed with bus architectures and extra processors to facilitate managed code p  pstrongIs there any metaphor to Model T Fords not being fast enough that Im missingstrongp

Negative 134 pI am studding IL.p  pI like .Net Reflector tool from RedGate Lutz initially. I already have Serge Lidins and Ecma335 books. It looks like these things are all we have to work with IL except ILAsm and ILDasm, of course.p  pMy task is to parse assembly binary file and get IL code.  It is obvious that the assembly is a binary file hence, it is just a chain of bytes. To do what I want I need to know the assembly structure which headers exist, how much bytes they occupy, offsets in bytes to read it byte after byte, etc.p  pLidins book describes it, but it is not 100 clear for me. Did anyone try to parse DLL as byte stream To have metadata and IL code as byte streams, then parse the IL byte stream to get IL source I do not want to use reflection here Id want to work just with the binary file, rather.p  pDoes the mono Cecil do the same Even if so, Id want to know how to do it.p  pAnd yes, I am trying to create another wheel like that of .NET Reflector and I want to know how its made.

Negative 134 pI think Im missing something fundamental and so I want to ask the community for some help. Im building an app based around a basic iPhone Utility Application. My MainView and FlipsideView share some elements so I have created separate ViewControllers and nib files for those pieces. In order to do this I have done the following 1. Created a viewcontroller called searchDateViewController which is the files owner of searchDateView.xib 2. searchDateView.xib is basically a UIView with a UILabel inside, the view is wired up correctly 3. Inside both MainViewController.m and FlipsideViewController.m I add a subview as folllowsp  precode voidloadView     [super loadView]     searchDateViewController  [[SearchDateViewController alloc] initWithNibNameSearchDateView bundlenil]     [[searchDateViewController view] setFrame[searchDateView frame]]     [[self view] addSubview[searchDateViewController view]]  ...  codepre  pEverything displays and works just fine. Basically depending on actions that happen in each of the main and flipside views the UILabel of the nib is changed. However, I wanted to do something slightly different if the searchDateViewController is loaded from the MainView or the FlipsideView. However, I cant seem to figure out which ViewController is adding the searchDateViewController subview.p  pIn searchDateViewController I triedp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     NSLogsuperview , self.view.superview     NSLogparentviewcontroller , self.parentViewController  codepre  pIn both cases I get nil.p  pSo my question is  can I find out which ViewController is adding searchDateViewController a a subview If so how Or if my logic here is completely messed up, how should I be doing thisp  pThanksp

Negative 134 pThere seem to be a number of ways to handle a multiple foreign key association. Each way I have approached this has their draw backs, and as I am new to Rails I am convinced others have come across a similar scenario and I am probably working on something solved long ago.p  pMy question is p  pstrongWhat would be an efficient way of handling a multiple index key association, while still retaining all other Rails sql modifiers such as include etcstrongp  pMy scenario isp  pI have a table association as follows simplified, which is used to connect people to other people via linksp  precodePeople   id  name         1   Joe          2   Sally        3   Bob                          Links   id  originid  rcvdid    1   2          1          2   1          3                                  3   3          2                                 codepre  pFrom row 1 of the above Links table, one can see that a Person Sally  2 is linked to another Person Joe  1.p  pIt is easy for me to find all of a Persons Links if my foreign key was originid. But this would only show People originating a Link. In my scenario I need to see all links regardless if they were originated or received by a Person. If for example I were to ask for all of Sallys links Sally  2, the result I would want would bep  precodeLinks   id  originid  rcvdid    1   2          1                                  3   3          2                                 codepre  pHence I have 2 index keys, both originid and rcvdid.p  pOne way this could be solved is with a Methodp  precodeclass Person lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany  linkorigins,  classname gt Link, foreignkey gt originid, dependent gt destroy   hasmany  linkrcvds,    classname gt Link, foreignkey gt rcvdid, dependent gt destroy  def links   originperson  rcvdperson end codepre  pHowever, this is not efficient. For example this requires the entire collection to be gathered from the database and only then does the paginate method work I am using the willpaginate gem, which defeats the point as paginate should speed up the process by limiting the number of records called. Not limit the records after the entire collection is already done.p  pAlso, the above will not allow me to call for example, Joe.linksfirst.originid.name. Not exactly this code but meaning I could not call the Person details on the originid of a selected link, as the links method does not know that originid is related to the People table. p  pSo far the most workable solution seems to be the findersql.p  precodeclass Person lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany links, findersql gt SELECT  FROM links WHERE links.originid  id or links.rcvdid  id codepre  pThis gives all links where the Personid matches either the Links.originid or the Links.rcvdid.p  pThe down side of this option, is that using findersql, rules out all the other sql modifiers since Rails  doesnt know how to parse and modify the SQL you provide. For example I would not be able to use the include option with the findersql.p  pSo, right now I am using the findersql, solution. But it seems there might be a away of getting this association done in such a way that I dont need a findersql. For example, is there a way to write a custom sql string while retaining the Rails sql modifiers that Active Record supplies.p  pAny ideas on the abovep

Negative 134 pIm trying to create GtkTreeViewColumn resizing functionality like how it is in Thunderbird. Key word here is trying. So far I havent succeeded.p  pThe easiest way to understand how this resizing works is to fire up Thunderbird and play with resizing the columns yourself, but basically the way it works in Thunderbird is if you drag, say, column 1 to the right, this increases the width of column 1, at the same time decreasing the width of column 2 by the same amount. This happens until column 2 reaches its minimum width for example, 0 pixels. At this point, continuing to drag column 1 to the right still increases the width of column 1, but since column 2 cannot be shrunken any further, then column 3 is shrunken until it reaches its minimum width. This continues until all of the columns to the right of column 1 are at their absolute minimum widths at this point, column 1 cant have its width increased anymore, so continuing to drag the column to the right does nothing.p  pWhile the mouse button is still held down, if you were to start dragging column 1 to the left again to shrink it, what would happen is what happened above, except in reverse order. As column 1 shrinks, the last column in the tree view grows until reaching its width at the time the original drag when the mouse was first pressed down to start the drag first started. At this point, the second to last column grows until reaching its width at the time of the original drag... and so on.p  pThen of course, when column 1 reaches its minimum width, column 0 shrinks until it reaches its minimum width. Since column 0 is the first column, then continuing to drag column 1 to the left wont shrink it anymore in fact, nothing will happen.p  pOne of the major benefits to handling dragging like this is the columns will never be resized out of bounds and cause the GtkTreeView to grow in width or, if the GtkTreeView containing the GtkTreeViewColumns is packed into a scrolled window, cause horizontal scrollbars to appear. Having these scrollbars appear, or the tree view grow in width and thus increase the width of the window is super annoying for the user and makes things look a lot less clean. Which is, I assume, why Thunderbird handles it this way, as do other applications.p  pSo, anyway, my problem is that I just cant figure out how to do this in GTK. Im wondering if its even possible If it is... how would it be done Im clueless here.p  pAs far as I know, the only signal you can connect to to know if a GtkTreeViewColumn has been resized is the notifywidth signal. Problem is, you cant return TRUE or FALSE from the signal handler function to tell GTK not to allow the resize to go through. Its just a notification signal. So that prevents me from, for example, detecting that all columns to the right of the one being dragged have reached their minimum widths and then telling GTK to stop the column from having its width increased anymore.p  pAnother problem if you call codegtktreeviewcolumnsetfixedwidthcode  what I am doing is calling codegtktreeviewcolumnsetresizablecolumn, TRUEcode and then calling codegtktreeviewcolumnsetsizingcolumn, GTKTREEVIEWCOLUMNFIXEDcode when creating the columns, by the way  within the codenotifywidthcode signal, it creates an infinite loop, which I dont know how to prevent, either.p  pAgain, any help would be much appreciated.p
Negative 134 pI have a piece of code that uses NSURLConnection to fetch a network resource asynchronously and parse some XML as it streams in. The XML parsing is handled by libxml2 which is available as a framework in the iOS SDK. This works perfectly when I invoke it once, parse the XML and release the resources by calling xmlFreeParserCtxtctxt. p  pMy problem is that when I run this same code in multiple threads, all of a sudden i see EXCBADACCESS pop up which I trace back to the libxml2. Specifically the xmlParserCtxtPtr context which is initialized and used for XML parsing seems to throw the EXCBADACCESS when I release it after I am done retrieving the resource.  The exception goes away if I do not release this context i.e. call xmlFreeParserCtxtctxt. p  pThis leads me to believe that my issues are some how related to libxml framework available in iOS not being thread safe. p  pSure enough, I see this when I google the issue  From a hrefhttpxmlsoft.orgthreads.html relnofollowhttpxmlsoft.orgthreads.htmlap  blockquote   pStarting with 2.4.7, libxml2 makes provisions to ensure that concurrent threads can safely work in parallel parsing different documents. There is however a couple of things to do to ensure itp blockquote  precode configure the library accordingly using the withthreads options  call xmlInitParser in the main thread before using any of the libxml2 API except possibly selecting a different memory allocator codepre  pSo I have two questions 1. Is my assumption correct that the version of libxml that I am using is not thread safe and hence causing the issue Has anyone else seen this 2. I know that the iOS bundles libxml2.2.x  would it work if I get libxml2.4.7 and add it to my project Would that cause any rejections on the app storep  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 134 pI have a custom codeQGraphicsItemcode that display large 100s of MB compressed, mutlichannel images. Its working pretty well right now.p  pThe idea is only load scanlines that are needed for current view scale and graphics view port. And divide the display into tiles that are built in separate threads. The a hrefhttpdoc.trolltech.comlatestqgraphicsitem.htmlpaint relnofollowcodepaintcodea function only constructs the tiles and feed them to QThreadPool. It also checks for and draw any tiles that are done. There are more code handling the events between the threadsrunnables and the item. But this is the basic part.p  pThe goal is to provide a responsive UI. When the item is updating itself, UI is not blocked. It all work well until I tried to figure how to print it.p  pThe problem is I need to know a particular call to my paint function is resulted from a print instead of on screen update.

Should I create my own or is there an existing tool everyone finds dreamyp  pHere are my specificsp  pstrongAuthenticationstrong Ive spent the past few weeks studying up on the dangers of user security in PHP and it seems the further down the rabbit hole you dive, the more there is to learn. I feel confident that I can write a system that rotates sessions on every request, can prevent XSS and XSRF, and generally protect my backend fairly well. Im hesitant to look into existing tools simply because its easier to trust and blame yourself than someone else.p  pstrongSession Handlingstrong The more I looked into security, the more pragmatic it seemed that its smarter to use session handling inside a database instead of native to PHP. That way, you can build and monitor ACLs easier, clustering, etc.p  pMy concern with a database structure is that if there are a few hundred people hammering on this database at a time altering their sessionids every page call, I could run into some performance issues at scale.p  pOriginally I was planning on creating my own classes for this in PHP and use MySQL as the backend. Now Im worried that MySQL would have concurrency issues. Ive looked into NoSQL like MongoDB, but then I paralyze myself thinking that I may be OVERTHINKING the whole damn thing. Then after the brain freeze pain is over, I start to think someone has to have already done this and I guarantee theyve thought of everything Im too stupid to consider.p  pIm hoping there are greater minds out there that have encountered the same questions I am facing and have some advice for me. Is there something out there that you would trust for this type of purpose or should I continue down the path of writing my own and if so which tools do you think are the best option for such a taskp  pIf you made it this far, thank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the community on thisp

Negative 134 pSo I have been playing around with threads for the last couple months and while my output is as expected i have a feeling Im not doing this the best way. I cant seem to get a straight answer from anyone i work with on what is best practice so i thought i would ask you guys.p  pQuestion Im going to try to make this simple so bear with me. Say i have a form that has a start and stop button.  The start button fires and event that starts a thread.  Inside this threads codeDoWorkcode it is going to call 3 methods.  Method1 prints to the console An 10 times with a pause of 10 seconds in between. Method2 and Method3 are the exact same just different letter and different pause times in between codeConsole.WriteLinecode.  Now when you press the stop button you want the response to be immediate.  I dont want to have to wait for the methods to complete.  How do i go about thisp  pThe way i have been doing this is passing my BackgroundWorker to each method and checking the worker.CancellationPending like sop  precode public void Method1BackgroundWorker worker            forint i  0 i lt 10 ampamp worker.CancellationPending i                Console.WriteLineA         forint j  0 j lt 100 ampamp worker.CancellationPending i                    Thread.Sleep100                      codepre  pLike i said this give me the desired result however imagine that method1 becomes a lot more complex, let say it is using a DLL to write that has a keydown and a key up.  If i just abort the thread i could possibly leave myself in an undesired state as well. I find myself littering my code with codeworker.CancellationPendingcode. Practically every code block i am checking CancellationPending.  I look at a lot of example on line and i rarely see people passing a thread around like i am.  What is best practices on thisp

Negative 134 pIm creating a new sandbox AppDomain whose ApplicationBase and PrivateBinPath for example sake has been set to codeCMyAppcode. My executing application is running from codeCSomewhereElsecode.p  pWhen I codeotherDomain.Load...code an assembly, my executing AppDomain is also loading the assembly. Im determining this by checking codeGetAssembliescode before the load, and then also the codeGetAssembliescode after the load.p  pWhy is this happening I suspect it has something to do with the metadata needing to be available in the executing AppDomain and its passed back over from the new domain via Cross Boundary, so the calling domain is loading the assembly too.

Negative 134 pCurrently my database design is not normalised.p  pWhen a user visits the website all the data such as the full browser name, OS name, etc are stored. This is causing the database to grow very fast at a rate of about 10GB a day with just 2 million people a day 2 million inserts per day. However this only means that there is only one insert per data. I am using mysql and php.p  pNow what I was wondering if it would be faster if I normalised the data. What I mean is create separate tables for OS name and OS ids, browser name and browser id. Then use the ids in the traffic log table. In this situation there would be two lookups in the browser table and the os table for the ids and if they dont exist then two inserts and then another insert with the browser id and os id in the traffic log table. So 2 selects and 2 potential inserts and 1 set insert.p  pWhich one is likely to be faster. Also are there any other options for file based approach for storing the os etc or maybe store the all possible browsers, os in arrays and then only insert if the visitor has one of those browsers or os else just put them in as none.p

Negative 134 pI do not have the link anymore as it was a few months back, but there was a great and detailed article about setting the charset of the body being sent to the useragent.p  pThe gist of the article was that when possible, send it via the contenttype header since the useragents parser will know before the body begins being parsed that it is for example utf8, etc.p  pSending it via meta tag means it has to wait for said meta tag to be found, then return to the top of document and begin reparsing the document again.p  pSo for quite a while now, we have been sending the charset via contenttype header, like so in PHP anywaysp  precodeheaderContenttype texthtml charsetutf8 codepre  pAll works great.

Negative 134 pI have an architectural question concerning custom fields in a view for an object. Lets say you have a User Object with some basic information like firstname, lastname, ... that can be used by all customers.p  pNow, often we get a question from a customer to add couple of custom fields typical for their domain. Our solution now is an xml data column where key value pairs are stored. This has been ok so far, but now well have to find a more architectural solution.p  pFor instance, now, a customer wants a dropdown where it can select the value for its custom field. We could still store the selected value in the xml data column, but where do we store all those dropdown values...p  pI know that in sharepoint you can also add custom fields like dropdowns and I was wondering how to deal with this best. I want to avoid creating custom tables for customers, or having a table with 90 columns 10 basic and then 10 for each customer, ...p  pYou get the idea, it should be generic and be able to deal with all sorts of problems in the future.p  pWhat I was thinking about is a Table UserConfiguration where each record has a Foreign Key to the Customer Channel in our database, then a column FieldName, a column FieldType and a column Values. The column values should be an xml type column, because for a dropdown, well need to add multiple values. Also, each value can have extra data attached to it not just a name. The other problem then is how to store the selected value. I dont like the idea of having foreign keys to xml in my database read somewhere that Azure cant handle this all to well. Do you just store the name of the value what if the value were to disappear out of the xmlp  pAny documentation, links on this kind of problems would also be great. Im trying to find a design pattern that deals with this kind of problem in the database.p

The cloning procedure for Root prescribes that all child elements must be cloned and therefore the codeclonecode operation for Element1 is called again, which then repeats the same cloning procedure, producing an endless loop.p  pFurthermore, the Root will not contain the first clone of Element1, but it will produce its own clone to add as a child.

Negative 134 pIm making a little Tetris clone using some of the HTML 5 features, and Ive come to a bit of a dilemma.p  pMy tetrominos arent composed of blocks  they have shading and shadows that depend on the rotation and thus each is its own image.  Which means I cant use the normal redraw everything every time the game state changes, because that would mean keeping track of all the piece drop history and replaying it whenever I want to clear a line.p  pSo my options arep  p1 Create two canvas elements stacked upon each other.  The one on the back is the board image.  The one on top is the pieces canvas, where I can slice and rearrange things easily.  This feels very hackish though, as I wanted to keep everything in one canvas element.p  p2 Create a drawing context and a buffer context.  In the buffer context, I have all of the pieces and can manipulate it freely, and when its time to draw the buffer to the screen, I getImageData, loop through all of the pixels, and composite them onto the board image.  I then write this into the drawing context with putImageData.  This hassle occurs because I cant find a way to take an ImageData structure and composite it onto a canvas element you can do that with ImageElements using drawImage, but drawImage wont take an ImageData structure.p  pNeither solution seems very elegant to me.p  pThanksp

Negative 134 pI am a beginner in Java and for some practise, I am creating a text based noughts and crosses. What I have so far is a Player class, a Board class and a Game class. In the Game class, I have one instance of Board and two instances of Player. I have managed to write code for a player to make a move and to determine whether the game is a win or draw. I now want to ensure that a player can only have one move at a time and not more than one consecutive move i.e Player A, Player B, Player A, Player B...... rather than Player A, Player A, Player A...p  pThe way I thought of doing this was to create a boolean field in the Player class of myTurn and have a method along these lines p  precodepublic boolean isMyTurn  if myTurn  true return false  return true  codepre  pI then invoke this method in the game glass before I make a move, but for some reason it doesnt work. Maybe Ive made a mistake somewhere but if anyone has any other waysideas I could write some code to determine if a payers turn is valid or not, please let me know. Would appreciate if you could provide some examples too as Im still a beginner. p

Last seen at shows me in the new venue.p  pIm not checking in off the grid and I do have the Include me in the public list of people who are currently checked in at a venue checked. Even tried unchecking it and checking it back. Ive tried with 2 different accounts and Ive tried with and without shouts, with and without sharing to facebook and twitter, and the normal and quick checkin options. All with the same results.p  pNOTE that Im not just relying on the apps showing me that Im at a venue, Im looking at the raw json returned from the API, both from my app and the API Explorer  developer.foursquare.com.p  pIf it helps, heres the HTTP Post from my app venue and oauth token removedp  pa hrefhttpsapi.foursquare.comv2checkinsaddbroadcastpublic,facebookampvenueIdthevenueidampoauthtokenmytokenampv20111030 relnofollowhttpsapi.foursquare.comv2checkinsaddbroadcastpublic,facebookampvenueIdthevenueidampoauthtokenmytokenampv20111030ap  pIve even tried changing the version to ampv20120107 and it still doesnt work.

Negative 134 pWe have a .NET application that transfers files from a client workstation to a database on a central server in a LAN. A few of our customers run this on wireless Windows XP workstations that use a commercial, 3rdparty WiFi encryption mechanism for various reasons they dont use standard WiFi encryption such as WPA. Fairly consistently, these workstations bluescreen when our application runs.p  pOur application does not directly call any unmanaged code, but apparently something our program is doing is indirectly causing a problem in the underlying network stack. I got a mini kernel dump file from one of the affected machines and loaded it in WinDbg, and it told me that the crash was probably caused by the .sys file which is one of the driver files for the encryption software which I already suspected. However, the debugger didnt tell me much else that was helpful.p  pMy question is this strongis there any way for me to get a stack trace from the point of the crash all the way up to our .NET applicationstrong Do I need a complete memory dump I have the source for our application, but I am hindered by the fact that a I dont have the source or symbols for the driver in question and b I am not experienced with lowlevel Windows debugging. I dont mind modifying our application if necessary to avoid the problematic calls if necessary, but Id need to know what calls to avoid.p

So for example, if you need to load 20 images for your UI, thats 20 less requests. And, if you store each image in the local storage, then you only need to load them once. Doesnt work for older browsers so it only works for 80 of browsers but still.... something to consider because times on your side in terms of browser evolution.p

Negative 134 pI have an issue that has just recently come to my attention. We have a report that clients can view. Works perfectly fine in Firefox because thats what we use to test normally. Well weve had 2 isolated incidents of where a client loaded it in chrome or ie and the margins and spacing are completely messed up.p  pHere is a photo...chrome on left, firefox on right..it is suppose to look just like it does in firefox.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comGtQwn relnofollowhttpimgur.comGtQwnap  pi can look at 50 different reports by the same people and all are fine except for this 1...well now its 2 but im totally lost as to what caused this. Like the only thing i can thing of is it is in the data and for some reason something in the data is actually messing with the settings, but i havent seen anything that would cause it. is there any special characters that ie would recognize that firefox just skips over... also..if you need me to post code i can...but its long. Ive set widths of table cells and of tale for these specific pages ignore the widths. All the reports work fine in chromefirefoxie except for these 2. Thanks for any help or advice.p  pEDIT i did limit it the the part that i think seems to cause the problem, at least the part that is messed up in the image i sentp  pthis doesnt show any changes i have made..this is just what the original was, so even though for every cell i went in and set widths, as i said in OP, it didnt affect it so i went with original codep  phere is the reports.aspx.cs pagep  pa hrefhttppastebin.comvvbxASeq relnofollowhttppastebin.comvvbxASeqap  phere is the css pagep  pa hrefhttppastebin.come0XMn4Lj relnofollowhttppastebin.come0XMn4Ljap  psorry for length  had to use pastebin links because it was too many characters for SO.p  pEdit 2 same id number for that report...so far..i have 2 id numbers that do this....but all the others seem to work fine..it makes me think its more of a data issue..but at same time..something in that data is causing explorer and chrome to freak out..im more of just trying to figure out why they are freaking out or why is firefox not freaking out..and it might help me find the thing causing the whole problem, because when i look at the data in the db ..it all looks fine and matches other reports that display correctly..but it might be something so small that i dont even realize it. p

Negative 134 pI have a plain UITableView with 4 rows, each with a height of 50. When I press the fourth row, I insert a fifth row with a height of 80 using UITableViewRowAnimationTop. So far, so good.p  pI want to delete the fifth row when the fourth row is pressed again. But when I delete the row using UITableViewRowAnimationTop or any other animation style for that matter, the animation looks very awkwardthe animation begins but the cell disappears abruptly before the animation is complete. This is only apparent when youre using cells that have a background color. You can see the bottom half of the cell suddenly disappear rather than disappearing under the cell above it.p  pThe code is something like thisp  precode[self.tableview beginupdates] [self.tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectindexPath] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationTop] [self.tableview endupdates] codepre  pThe row heights are provided by the codetableViewheightForRowAtIndexPathcode method.p  pThis problem does not occur when all rows have the same height, or when the row being deleted is shorter than the other rows.p  pI think one workaround is changing the height of the fifth cell to 50 before deleting it, but Id rather not do that.Please helpp
Negative 134 pI have Common.dll thats sharedused by far more than two SharePoint packages being deployed to the same GAC used by a single SharePoint instance. The shared assembly evolves from product deployment to product deployment, and its not treated as a product in and of itself. It is not released, per se. It evolves only in the context of other SharePoint productspackages.p  pThe common assembly is primarily just a repository for highly reusable code. Its used only by a small internal team of developers.p  pBranchingmerging allows various products to take on the latest version of Common.dll whenever it suits the developers. Each products development effort schedules the risk of taking on the new version of Common.dll.p  pMy need is to have those assemblies act in isolation from product to product  from SharePoint package to SharePoint package.p  pBut thats not happening. Instead, every time I deploy, Common.dll is overwritten in the GAC such that all products using it receive the behavior of this most recent version of Common.dll.

Negative 134 pMy code is for an applet that expands a binomial. I havent finished it, but itll only accept an exponent between 1 and 10, inclusive. I got it to 7, but like I said, I havent finished.

Negative 134 pI am using EF with an oracle database. One of our columns in the database has a data type of Number1,0. This field stores data that translates to Int16 in C. Entity Data Model EDM builder in visual studio maps this column as Bool default. This causing data type errors. What I want to do is configure the model generator to set number1, 0 as a Int16 field all the time instead of bool.p  pHow would I do this.p  pI also want to mention that when a fellow developer builds this model on his machine it will set it as Int16 short. When I do it on my machine it does bool. We cant figure out why one of us sees different results then the other.p  pThanksp

Negative 134 pI am trying to design an IDElike NonEditable program with a richtextbox control. Basically, I need the treeview which is positioned to the left side of the RTB to expandcollapse a certain portion of my code whenever the user clicks on the  buttons. The expandable collapsable ranges are defined as wherever the curly brackets are seen. For instance in the RTB if I had something likep  precodeint main     if ...            if ...                        else          codepre  pIf I were to click on the topmost curly bracket, it would collapse everything inside the main function. Basically whats contained inside that curly bracket is what is folded. So in summary, Im trying to design something that is very similar to Visual Studios expandcollapse code function except it also does that with the ifelse functions.p  pIm aware of the bracket matching algorithm and I implemented a stack to know which pairs of the brackets match Line numbers stored in a list of tuple. p  pThe issue Im having majorly is how to go about designing the actual treeview. I need the treeview to be in a linear fashion, where no nodes are added on top of another. I am not aware of any approach which can add the expandcollapse button without actually adding child nodes on top of another node.p  pAlso, with the exception of the  buttons and a singular vertical line, I need the treeview nodes to be noneditable, nonvisible and nonclickable.p  pFinally and this is assuming if I fulfilled the above requirements, I need the RTBs vertical scroll event to correctly scroll the treeview as well.

Negative 134 pThere is a site with responsive design. The main menu and logo take almost the whole first screen on mobile devices. The site owner considers its not OK and wants to use a menu like a button like on starbucks.com site, mobile version. But not for the whole site. Only for several pages.p  pIn my opinion its not OK to use different types of navigation on different site pages because it can confuse site visitors. I suggest either to leave it as is or replace the current menu with the new menu on all pages. How can I argue in favour of this Is it a normal practice to use different navigation methods on different pages or it is not recommended Are there maybe any articles on the matterp

Negative 134 pIm new to C, C and OpenCL. I have two questions.p  p1 If I have a number of host input data variables such as long and double arrays is there any way to avoid copying each one to the device in the traditional OpenCL way i.e. createBuffer etc and instead simply map some memory from the device into the host and write host pointers into the device memory to then access within the kernel Im told there is but I cannot figure out the code to do this.p  pBelow I have an example input data array. The objective is to somehow relay a pointer to it to the device without copying it in any way as the various input data variables could be very large. I allocate a buffer, enqueue a map buffer, get a device pointer back but then Im unsure of how to pass the input to that device pointer. Ive used a type of cllong for the device pointer which may be wrong.p  precodecllong inputData[2]  1,2  clmem inputBuffer  clCreateBuffercontext, CLMEMREADONLY  CLMEMCOPYHOSTPTR,          sizeofcllong  2, NULL, NULL  cl long inputMap  cllong clEnqueueMapBuffer         queue, inputBuffer, TRUE, CLMAPWRITE, 0,          sizeofcllong  2, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL   what to do here  clEnqueueUnmapMemObjectqueue, inputBuffer, inputMap, 0, NULL, NULL codepre  pIve used space for two cllongs above but in reality if Im passing pointers to host data what would I allocate herep  p2 What about packing pointers to more than one input variable into the same memory space returned by clEnqueueMapBuffer Lets say I have a long array and a double array can I pass pointers to both of them into the same piece of mapped device memoryp  pI would really appreciate some example source code with particular elaboration on host and device memory and how they are kept in sync as well as on pointers as Im a bit new to them.p  pP.S. I have seen another example on SO of writing host data into device mapped memory httpstackoverflow.comquestions5673794openclmappedmemorydoesntwork but again it uses a manual write of data into the memory equivalent to copying.p  pUPDATE In response to Rajs comment replying here in case my comment is too long Ive already begun using that flag but probably have a mistake in my pointer code somewhere.p  precodedouble a[2]   3.0, 6.0   sizet pointerSize  sizeofdouble  clmem bufA  clCreateBuffercontext, CLMEMREADONLY  CLMEMALLOCHOSTPTR, pointerSize, NULL, NULL clSetKernelArgkernel, 0, sizeofclmem, ampbufA  double pA  double clEnqueueMapBufferqueue, bufA, CLTRUE, CLMAPWRITE, 0, pointerSize, 0, NULL, NULL, amperr pA  a codepre  pAt this point if I print a[0] and a[1] in the kernel itself I getp  precodea[0]3.000000 a[1]0.000000 codepre  pa[1] is obviously wrong.

However when try to fill any particular cell with color and export it on PDF output, all the grid lines are invisible. p  pstrongSimpleTableDemo.javastrongp  precodepackage com.swing.table  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Component import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Graphics2D import java.awt.GridLayout import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.util.HashMap import java.util.Map  import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTable import javax.swing.border.LineBorder import javax.swing.table.TableCellRenderer import javax.swing.table.TableColumn import javax.swing.table.TableColumnModel  import com.itextpdf.text.Document import com.itextpdf.text.PageSize import com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfContentByte import com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfTemplate import com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfWriter import com.swing.data.BorderCellRenderer  public class SimpleTableDemo extends JPanel implements ActionListener       private boolean DEBUG  false     private int spacing  6     private Map columnSizes  new HashMap     String[] columnNames   First Name, Last Name, Sport,  of Years,             Vegetarian       Object[][] data                                    Kathy,                     Smith,                     SnowboardingXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,                     new Integer5, new Booleanfalse ,              John, Doe, Rowing, new Integer3, new Booleantrue ,              Sue, Black, Knitting, new Integer2, new Booleanfalse ,              Jane, White, Speed reading, new Integer20,                     new Booleantrue ,              Joe, Brown, Pool, new Integer10, new Booleanfalse        final JTable table  new JTabledata, columnNames      public SimpleTableDemo          supernew GridLayout0, 1          table.setPreferredScrollableViewportSizenew Dimension500, 70          table.setFillsViewportHeighttrue           Create the scroll pane and add the table to it.

Any ideas on why this could be and what can be done to fix this bug. p  pWhat this code is currently doing is it will take the two divs in the foreach statement and will put all one line, but foreach item in the collectioneach div it will skip a line.

In other words, changing the color cycle affects everything in the plot not the only line of interest. emThis is not of our interest at all.em   p  pThe second link which is to the matplotlib site uses segmentation of each lines into many. This is not good approach because for a huge number of lines, say, 10000 or even more even if you choose only 10 segments per line the result is too huge Even then the resulting lines are not smoothly colored at all If you make the number of segmentation a function of the line segments for better gradient, the resulting will be really huge Hard to display, difficult to save as file properly.p

Negative 134 pI wrote a CUDA program that has several subroutines. When I disable subroutine A, the runtime improves by amount a. When I disable subroutine B the runtime improves by amount b. When I disable subroutines A and B the runtime improves by amount c  a  b. Both subroutines are completely independent of each other.p  pThis next part may be a naive approach to analyze this, but here is what I did I compiled each version of the code and ran emcuobjdump dumpsassem for each binary. The resulting output was about 1350 lines for the complete binary and around 1100 lines for each binary with one subroutine disabled. If I disabled both subroutines I got 850 lines. It appears that I need 3.1 us per line for the first three and 2.4 us for both subroutines disabled.p  pSince A and B do not contain anything complicated or use memory more intensively than the rest of the code I do not think that this is caused by commenting out all the time intensive operations and leaving the simple ones active. My guess is that the program code with both A and B disabled still fits in the streaming multiprocessors instruction caches while the other versions are too large. That might result in global memory accesses so that more program code can be loaded and the latency causes this discrepancy. Unfortunately I could not find any information on the instruction cache size.p  pCan anyone help me with the interpretation of these resultsp

Negative 134 pI am trying to rotate a sphere continuously on a given axis using this codep  precodegl.glRotatefaxisX, 0, 1, 0 gl.glRotatefaxisY, 0, 0, 1  axisX  axisX1360 axisY  axisY1360 codepre  pThe variables codeaxisXcode and codeaxisYcode are both being incremented by one right now which would make the rotation go in a diagonal direction up to the right. The object gets to about 45 degrees of rotation and then start to turn and start rotation the other way. How can I get it to continuously rotate on an axis other than just x and y by themselvesp  pNote I am trying to hook up a virtual joystick to control the codeaxisXcode and codeaxisYcode values and have the sphere rotate on the axis represented by the joystick. If anyone has any advice on that, that would be great as well.p  pstrongEditstrong Ive change it so that if I use codegl.glRotatefangle, axisX, axisY, axisZcode that it works and keeps the rotation going, but the rotation isnt smooth, it looks like the rotation starts over when I switch the rotation axis.p

This is done actually with the code found in the tutorial.p  pstrongThread Type Bstrong Other Btype threads need to wait for the current Btype thread to finish its execution.p  pI was thinking in using the same tutorial for the Btype threads, but I realized I cant use it because the other threads keep invoking themselves until its unblocked, and invoking themselves would remap the drive and it wont work argh, I can see if the drive is mapped but emnotem where does it map to... I could, but its unneccesary code I want to avoid writing.p  pI did my homework and went through google and even made a small app to try my excercise by using the lock keyword in C, without success, even though the function blocks other threads, they keep calling the blocking function and I dont want that p  pTheres lots of tutorials out there but none are concise and tothepoint enough to allow me to understand them. Ive found a few questions here in SO but theyre mostly javarelated, and Im working in C 4.0.p  pWell, heres the code I wrote. If you run it youll notice the other threads will call the blocking function. I dont want the function to be called until the first thread which called it finishes. Either that, or make some kind of queue but also avoid the queue to fill itself due to the time other threads took in doing their process.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading  namespace ThreadTest      public class BlockObj              Object lockObj  new Object          public void DoBlockint id                      lock lockObj                              Console.WriteLineCounter   id   locking object created, wait 5 sec                 Thread.Sleep5000                 Console.WriteLineStuff done, keep going                                 class Program              static Random r  new RandomDateTime.Now.Second         static BlockObj oo  new BlockObj          public static void Counterobject id                      int i  intid             while true                              Thread.Sleep1000  r.Next1, 10                 Console.WriteLineCounter   i   call blocking stuff...                 oo.DoBlocki                 Console.WriteLineCounter   i   finish work                                public static void Mainstring[] args                      for int i  0 i lt 5 i                              Thread t  new Threadnew ParameterizedThreadStartCounter                 t.Starti                             codepre  pActually, Id like to see some proofofconcept code of an app that would spawn two thread queues, and the threads in those queues would wait for the current thread to finish executing before running the next one. However, each queue would have their own blocking. Thread Queue 1 shouldnt block Thread Queue 2 executions and visceversa.p

Negative 134 pAfter reading up on again, should have done this a long time ago implementing equals and hashcode correctly i came to these conclusions,that works for mep  pstrongIf pre JDK 7strong Prefer using Apache commons equalsbuilder and hashcodebuilder. or Guava. Their javadocs contain examples of how to use them in good way.p  pstrongIf JDK 7strong Use the new Objects utility class p  pstrongBut, If writing for hibernatestrong some special requistes appear see sources farther down Amongst them are the recommended usage of eminstanceofem instead of emgetClassem, due to hibernate creating proxys of subclasses that are lazyloaded.p  pBut as i understand, if doing this another potential problem occurs The reason to use getClass is to ensure the symmetric property of the equals contract.

Negative 134 pIve searched the web and StackOverflow a lot, but cant seem to find a definitive answer to my following questions.p  pstrongContextstrongp  pI am looking to port a group of C helper libraries for use with the Windows Phone 8 WP8 platform. Historically, these libraries are built as static libs rather than DLLs.p  pI have successfully written the WP8specific code, so that the libraries are compatible and building against ARM, using the APIs available to WP8 using the WP API QuickStart doc as a reference point. Only one of the libraries e.g. Lib1 requires consumption of the WinRT extensions the ZW flag, due to having to replace the classic Win32 Thread calls with WinRTs ThreadPool.p  pWhen building Lib1, I get the following warning  Warning 1 warning LNK4264 archiving object file compiled with ZW into a static library note that when authoring Windows Runtime types it is not recommended to link with a static library that contains Windows Runtime metadata.p  p searching for this warning, I found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappshh771041.aspxthis articlea, stating If you consume a static library that creates public ref classes, public interface classes, or public value classes, the linker raises this warning. You can safely ignore the warning if the static library is not producing Windows Runtime components that are consumed outside the library itself. Public components in a static library will compile but will not activate at run time. Any Windows Runtime component thats intended for consumption by other components or apps must be implemented in a dynamiclink library DLL.p  pIn Lib1, ClassA contains the functions using WinRT ThreadPool calls. ClassA functions are called by ClassB, and they simply return regular HANDLEs and DWORDs to ClassB. p  pstrongCode examplestrongp  precode ClassA.cpp HANDLE WINAPI ClassACreateThread Params that are usually passed to Win32 CreateThread        Do WinRTThreadPool stuff to create WorkItem     auto workItem  ref new WindowsSystemThreadingWorkItemHandler[]WindowsFoundationIAsyncAction      More code that eventually results in a Win32 Handle      return handle    ClassB.cpp Handle handle  ClassACreateThread Params that are usually passed to Win32 CreateThread  codepre  pClassAs functions will only ever be called by ClassB, from within Lib1, and ClassB can then be used by the application linking Lib1.p  pstrongFinally, to my questionsstrongp  ol lipCan the C libraries that do emnotem consume WinRT extensions ZW, when built as static libs, be used by Windows Phone 8 applicationspli lipCan the C library Lib1 that emdoesem consume WinRT extensions ZW, when built as a static lib, be used by Windows Phone 8 applications, despite the warningpli lipIf the answer is no to either question, will I have to create WinRT Component wrappers for all of the classes in the respective library, like a hrefhttpwww.silverlightshow.netitemsWindowsPhone8NativeCodeSupport.aspxthis articlea demonstrates with the Mandelbrot Algorithm Or is there something else Im missingpli ol  pThanks in advance for any input you can provide.p
Negative 134 pI have a table in Excel with column headings that correspond to part of a dynamic named range elsewhere in my workbook.  For example, I have these column headings 10, 20, etc., and these dynamic named ranges ExampleRange10, ExampleRange2, etc.  Id like to enter a VLookup formula that references ExampleRange10 by concatenating the string ExampleRange and the column heading 10.  This would allow me to simply extend the formula across all columns in the table, instead of manually typing ExampleRange10, ExampleRange20, etc. in each columns formula.  p  pIm aware of the INDIRECT function, and have used it successfully in the past with named ranges, but it doesnt seem to be working with the emdynamicem named range in this case.  Im guessing this is a nuance that has something to do with how dynamic named ranges are defined by Excel they dont show up in the named range dropdown to the left of the formula bar, and they have some interesting properties in VBA, for example.  Is there a way I can use the INDIRECT formula in conjunction with a dynamic named range, or is there another way that I can go about solving this problemp  pstrongEditstrong Here are the exact formulas used.br This is the main formula codeVLOOKUPB2,INDIRECTExampleRangeampC1,2,FALSEcode where C1 contains 10 and the formula for my dynamic named range called ExampleRange10 is codeOFFSETSheet1F2,0,0,COUNTASheet1F2F25,2code.  The main formula returns REF, but it works correctly when I remove the dynamic named range formula and simply define ExampleRange10 as a static range.p

The PA is assigned to the first column on the list dollar amount is 2, and yesno is 3 3.p  pAfter the error, when I press OK it does appear however that the query has ran, so it may also be just a problem access is having with VBA. p  pAny suggestions I hope this wasnt too murky. p

Negative 134 pI currently have a two step process for my kendo charts.  The first process is allowing the user to select the datasets series they want on the chart.  They then choose a template.  A template is the graph settings ex color theme, chart type line, bar, circle ect..p  pCurrently if a user selects the datasets they want i return the series information to the graph and the graph is then populated with the template settings.p  pI also allow the user to change the template settings on the fly. For example a Bar chart to Line, Area, Circle ect.  They can also change the theme.  The issue becomes when the first load is set, the series information that i pass isp  precode   [name string, data []],    [name string, data []]  codepre  pwhen i inspect the series object after the change on the template I see the following added to the objectp  precode   [name string,    data [],    type area,    color ff6800,    ect...      ],   [name string,    data [],    type area,    color ff6800,    ect...      ],  codepre  pThe issue becomes that I can modify my object type to the correct selected type.  I can even change the color value to a differen color for each series.  However, because I am using the Kendo Themes, the chart background will change but then the series colors wont match.  I could come up with a function to choose the background color for the chart and then choose what colors you want for your series. But I would rather use the kendo methods if possible.p  pI also think if i clear out that object and just use the settings and data I am passing it could work.  However, I dont want to have to go to the database each time a page level changes is made and I also noticed that my object even if i create a temp object is given all of the chart properties.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 134 pFirst I want to be able to update all attributesfields and there is no single unique key. I have a hierarchy like each PC can be categorized as PC1PC2PC3 cant give example and each PC has Network and Software Info. Design and examples are p  pcodeParent Table PCEmpName, PCName, HostName,.... PhysicalLocation, PCTypecode codeEMPName,PCName,PCTypecode combined make this table unique.p  pExample record codeXYZ, Work Laptop,XYZPC,.....,DESK123,PC1codep  pChild Table codePCNetworkEmpName, PCName, HostName,IPAddr,....,PhysicalLocation,PCTypecodep  pcodeexample record1 XYZ, Work Laptop,XYZPC,0.0.0.0,....,DESK123,PC1codep  pcodeexample record2 XYZ, Work Laptop,XYZPC,0.0.0.1,....,DESK123,PC1codep  pSince I want all fields to be modifiable, I have added Surrogate Key Id column to both. I have used PCId as FK to Network table but while inserting I would have to write a query to get the Id from PC table. p  pThere are two problems, if I use naturalcomposite key I cant do update on every record since the updates are done through Asp.Net Gridview which doesnt allow primary key updates.p  pIf I use Surrogate Key, there is a possibility of duplicate records and I cant refer them or put foreign key constraint to other fields since they can be unique only by combining all three fields.p  pI am using SQL Server 2008 and ASP.Net 4.0p  pI am missing something for sure, can anyone help or suggest a good design for this.

Negative 134 pSo Im using RExcel to paste an array that I have stored just fine in R, and it turns a cell that should look like  X  Y  Z  into a number. It does this inconsistently when I change values, different cells will turn into numbers when they should be in that format. I cant even figure out what the number is from, but it changes only by a small fraction of its value. For example, the number listed in the attached image changes from 18736 to 20598 upon some data change. The only significance of that is that it appears to be based on data and not just a random number.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvZzwV.jpg altmy codep

Negative 134 pIn Corona sdk, is there a way to start a new sprite sheet when the first one ends I would like to be able to  use several sprite sheets instances in sequence.

Negative 134 pFrom the MSDN documentation on the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryk4yx47a1.aspxcodeArray.Copycodea methodp  blockquote   pWhen copying between multidimensional arrays, the array behaves like a long onedimensional array, where the rows or columns are conceptually laid end to end. For example, if an array has three rows or columns with four elements each, copying six elements from the beginning of the array would copy all four elements of the first row or column and the first two elements of the second row or column.p blockquote  pI have always assumed that, in C, twodimensional arrays are laid out in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRowmajororderrowmajor ordera and similarly for higher dimensions, so Im confused about the meaning of the parenthesized or columns in the above documentation. Does it mean that there may be circumstances where the .NET Framework uses columnmajor orderingp

Negative 134 pI want my activity to have two possible themes, say codeThemeHolocode and codeThemeHoloLightcode, as selected by the user. I need to programmatically draw things like horizontal dividers in this activity. The color of the divider should depend on the selected theme. How can I do that easilyp  pIdeally there should be a name for the standard color of a divider irrespective of the theme used, and the actual RGB realization of that color name would match the selected theme automatically. Is there such thing It seems unlikely to me that the programmer needs to hardcode RBG values.p  pOf course, the divider is only an example. I would also like to name the color of EditText, or other widgets, in a way that does not depend on the theme.p

I allready checkt the includet files but its only depending on the main file which is including all other files by conditions.p  pSO this is stuff from the askq.phpp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt  ltphp

I presume because of the One HTTP Request, one file rule.p  pI read a suggestion of using an iframe to perhaps get around this limitation. Ive tried putting this function in a separate file e.g. writezip and calling it from a another file likep  precodelt this code works and allows for an invisible file transfergt ltiframe srclt echo writezip.php gt height0px width0px frameBorder0 idgetfileurlgt ltiframegt  lt this code does not and will not run the iframe asynchronously gt lt Remove this line for a working solution gt lt echo ltiframe srcUntitled1.phpgt gt  lt echo File was sent to you gt codepre  pBut this doesnt appear to work I removed the function declaration when it is in its own file  so it will execute when the file loads.

Negative 134 pHadoop old API is deprecated for some time now, and there is not much information about the new one Im not talking about YARN, but about the a hrefhttphadoopbeforestarting.blogspot.com201212differencebetweenhadoopoldapiand.html relnofollowhttphadoopbeforestarting.blogspot.com201212differencebetweenhadoopoldapiand.htmla. I searched for days how could I enable it by default Only solutions Ive seen so far is setting configurations in codeoozie workflow.xmlcode or setting codeJobConf.setUseNewMappertruecode and codeJobConf.setUseNewReducertruecode inside own mapreduce. So my question is how can I enable it by default, so every single job would use it I mean Hive, HBase and etc. generated jobs. I tried setting codemapred.mapper.newapicode and codemapred.mapper.newapicode to true in codemapredsite.xmlcode but it doesnt work.p  pMoreover I found deprecated settings a hrefhttparchive.cloudera.comcdh4cdh4hadoophadoopprojectdisthadoopcommonDeprecatedProperties.html relnofollowhttparchive.cloudera.comcdh4cdh4hadoophadoopprojectdisthadoopcommonDeprecatedProperties.htmla . I think new properties only works on new api, because after setting codemapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximumcode and codemapreduce.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximumcode in codemapredsite.xmlcode to other than the default value, I still get default value 2. And if I set deprecated properties  codemapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximumcode and codemapred.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximumcode it works like a charm.p

Negative 134 pRecently I met a problem that my program seems waiting for an event handle and never return.p  pI call IcmpSendEcho2 to send ping request and have set the event parameter correctly. In normal situation if the ping response arrived or timeout the event handle should be singled by system. This works fine in most time but one day I found my program some of the working threads is halt after my computer wakes up from sleep state. I guess the root cause is that when the ping request is sent and before system signal the corresponding event handle then the system change to sleep state no operation for a long time then laptop change to sleep state. After system wakes up by me the previous event handle got no chance to be singled.p  pAdd the pseudo code isp  precode a working thread while isWorking      ...

Negative 134 pI need to load a Java AWT or Swing control in a WPF or WinForms window.p  pI have tried using IKVM, but I cannot use the converted Java controls in a .Net container.p  pI have also tried to use the WebBrowser control to load a webpage from the disk which contains an applet.

Its not necessary for it to work with voice calls, I believe achieving that sort of functionality is harder as its all done within the radio.p  pAny ideas on where to begin Ive done some research with OpenSL and ALSA, but it looks like Ill need to package new firmware ROM in order to define custom audio paths. If it can be avoided Id like to create an applicationlevel solution. The phones are rooted have su binaries. The target device for this is the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Edition GTi9505G.

Negative 134 pTried searching for this question but I think I dont know the jargon. I am entering my site content into a mysql database using php, but all of my accented letters or apostrophes spanish get transformed into some crazy encoding. Exp  precode becomes    becomes  codepre  pand etc. First off I dont know what this means or is, but when displaying them on my site, they definitely do not revert back, nor would I expect them too because if I manually enter in UTF8 letters they totally work on my site. p  pIs there a way to fix this without reentering all of my text I have a feeling I can extract them using php, decode them and then insert them back in but I do not know the functions that do this. The best solution, and if anyone knows how that would be amazing, would be to just do it within sql. By the way the columns say collation codeutf8generalcicode. p  pFor some further information, I am not doing anything to the text that gets entered into the database I know that is bad but I suck at this stuff Also I am not doing anything when it is being queried. My functions insert pure text and extract pure text to each page. In this way I can write html into my forms and it appears as html on the page and therefore the browser interprets it correctly. I also have a feeling this is really sloppy but like I said... Thanks for all the helpp  p Edit p  pSo thanks to people who pointed me to the other questions. However, the way I fixed it was not in that answer, it just gave me the write keywords to start a new search. For anyone who has this problem, the way I fixed it was using the function codeutf8decodecode. Im not sure this is a great fix, but at least it is working for now and speed was my biggest priority. I am certain the core problem is in how I am entering the data into the database. p

Negative 134 pSometimes associativity can be used to loose data dependencies and I was curious how much it can help. I was rather surprised to find out that I can nearly get a speedup strongfactor of 4strong by manually unrolling a trivial loop, both in Java build 1.7.051b13 and in C gcc 4.4.3.p  pSo either Im doing something pretty stupid or the compilers ignore a powerful tool. I started withp  precodeint a  0 for int i0 iltN i a  M1  a  t[i] codepre  pwhich computes something close to codeString.hashCodecode set codeM131code and use a codechar[]code. The computation is pretty trivial and for codet.length1000code takes about 1.2 microsecond on my i52400  3.10GHz both in Java and C.p  pObserve that each two steps codeacode gets multiplied by codeM2  M1M1code and added something. This leads to this piece of codep  precodeint a  0 for int i0 iltN i2      a  M2  a  M1  t[i]  t[i1]  lt note the parentheses  if i lt len a  M1  a  t[i]  Handle odd length. codepre  pThis is exactly twice as fast as the first snippet. Strangely, leaving out the parentheses eats 20 of the speedup. Funnily enough, this can be repeated and a factor of 3.8 can be achieved.p  pUnlike java, codegcc O3code chooses not to unroll the loop. Its wise choice since it wouldnt help anyway as codefunrollallloopscode shows.p  pSo my questionsup1sup is What prevents such an optimizationp  psupGoogling didnt work, I got associative arrays and associative operators only.supp  h2Updateh2  pI polished up my a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu4971686publishedmaaartinsoAssocBenchmark.java relnofollowbenchmarka a little bit and can provide some a hrefhttpsmicrobenchmarks.appspot.comrunsfa2f6f673ed24e3299b4b1dfc336657f relnofollowresultsa now. Theres no speedup beyond unrolling 4 times, probably because of multiplication and addition together taking 4 cycles.p  h2Update 2h2  pAs Java already unrolls the loop, all the hard work is done. What we get is something likep  precode...preloop for int i0 iltN i2      a2  M1  a  t[i]     a  M1  a2  t[i1]  ...postloop codepre  pwhere the interesting part can be rewritten likep  precode    a  M1  M1  a  t[i]  t[i1]  latency 2mul  2add codepre  pThis reveals that there are 2 multiplications and 2 additions, all of them to be performed sequentially, thus needing 8 cycles on a modern x86 CPU.

Then compare the target to the individual parts of the thing I am parsing through, and if it is equal, do something, in this problem remove it.p  pThis is where my question comes up can you parse through a class templates data member And if so, is it similar to parsing through a string or will you need some other kind of supportp  pstrongEditstrong T is going to be an codestdstringcode in all the cases I am using it for.p

In the course of my learning I began using rstudio and later got acquainted with the the use of markdown and latex within it. Now I am in the middle of my thesis and have fallen in love with the concept of RR and want to use it for my own research. Ive also learned about advantages of Github and setting up repositories, etc.p  h1Questionh1  pI have a lot of individual .R files filled with code, some .tex and .Rmd files for little reports. At some point I created a new rstudio project for 1 out of 3 given data sets and now keep all new analyses in that folder. I need your advice as to how can I combine all previous code to one folder Is doing everything in a single Rmd file wise and put this folder to github I know about creating new repos for new projects but dont know about putting existing project on github. What are the best practices in RR for a masters thesis projectp  pLater I want to create packages and Shiny apps related to my project.p

Negative 134 pI have found that when I try to overlay multiple rasters using plot...,addT if I try to overlay more than 3 rasters together the subsequent plot does not align the rasters properly.p  pMy original intent was to create a categorical map of modeled landcover where the darkness of the color representing a cover class varied wrt the certainty in our model projection. To do this, I created a simple script that would loop through each cover class and plot it e.g., forest, green color on map using a color gradient from grey low certainty forest prediction to full cover color e.g., dark green for areas are strongly predicted.  What I have found is that using this approach, after the 3rd cover is added to the plot, all subsequent rasters that are overlayed on the plot are arbitrarily misaligned. I have reversed the order of plotting of the cover classes and the same behavior is exhibited meaning it is not an issue with the individual cover class rasters. Even more puzzling in Rstudio, when I use the zoom button to closely inspect the final plot, the misalignment worsens.p  pDo you have any ideas of why this behavior exists Most importantly, do you have any suggested solutions or workaroundsp  pThe code and data on the link below has all of the behaviors described captured.  a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu332961r20plot20raster20add20issue.zip relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu332961r20plot20raster20add20issue.zipa Turn plotgradientF to see how if you just simply subset a same raster and add the subsets sequentially to the same plot you can replicate the issue. I have already tried setting the extent of the plot device plot..., ext but that did not work. I have also checked and the extent of each cover raster is the same.p  pBelow is the figure of the misaligned cover classes. plotting to jpeg device will result in a similar image i.e., this is not an issue of Rstudio rendering. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFTsgv.png altenter image description here Strangely enough, if I zoom into the image using Rstudio, the misalignment is different img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDfCOd.png altenter image description here For comparison, this is how the covers should align correctly in the landscape img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwcMel.png altenter image description herep  precodelibraryraster librarycolorRamps rasterofclassesrasterCr plot raster add issuerasterofclasses.tif rasterofcertaintyofclassesrasterCr plot raster add issuerasterofcertaintyofclasses.tif endColscdarkorchid4, darkorange3, red3, green4, dodgerblue4 colors to be used in gradients for each class classesuniquerasterofclasses minValcellStatsrasterofcertaintyofclasses, min tmpi1 addPlotF plotgradientF this is for debug only classesrevclasses turn this off and on to see how last 2 classes are mis aligned, regardless of plotting order for class in classes   rasterclassrasterofclassesclass create mask for individual class   rasterclass[rasterclass0]NA remove 0s from mask so they to do not get plotted   if plotgradient     rasterofcertaintyofclassrasterofcertaintyofclassesrasterclass apply class mask to certainty map    else     rasterofcertaintyofclassrasterclass apply class mask to certainty map      endColendCols[tmpi] pick color for gradient   col5 lt colorRampPalettecgrey50, endCol     if plotgradient     plotrasterofcertaintyofclass,           colcol5n49, breaksseqminVal,1,length.out50, as uncertainty values range from 0 to 1 plot them with fixed range          useRasterT, axesFALSE, boxFALSE, addaddPlot, legendF         else     plotrasterofcertaintyofclass,           colendCol,                 useRasterT, axesFALSE, boxFALSE, addaddPlot, legendF            tmpitmpi1   addPlotT after plotting first class, all other classes are added codepre

Negative 134 pI have a shared library that I would like to make executable, similar to libc.  When the library executes, I would like it to dump a list of the names of classes that are registered with a particular abstract factory this is C.  I use the standard technique of registering classes with the factory through the initializationconstruction of global variables.p  pThere are several tutorials on how to make shared libraries executable a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11912423unabletoprintffloatingpointnumbersfromexecutablesharedlibraryherea and a hrefhttppolentino911.wordpress.com20130808makeyourownexecutablesharedlibraryonlinux relnofollowherea, for example.  Its relatively straight forward.  However, when I try it out, I find that the entry point is executed strongbeforestrong any constructors of globals are called.  In my case, this means that no classes have registered with my factory, so I have no information to print out.p  pI would like to either execute the entry point strongafterstrong the constructors have been called, or learn how to strongtrigger construction myselfstrong from my entrypoint function.  Is this possible  Does anyone know how to go about doing this  Perhaps there is an internal libc function that I can extern and callp

It is like the sensor event thread is being preemted, and the events queue up behind the scene, or perhaps its the bluetooth recieve buffer that arent read. When i use the alternative p  precodeaccelerometer.registerInterruptListenertimeListener codepre  pThe events stream in even faster, and the hiccups gets even worse Can anybody tell me if this can be solved Is it my code, is it Android or Sonyp  pRegardsp  pEditp  pThe timestamps in the sensor events themselves dont show the catchup behavior, but continues at the steady rate of 3941ms the timestamps are in nanoseconds irl  why. Theres still the odd hiccup  usually 401 or 402ms. This would be much more useful to me when doing animation based on the accelerometer. But the listener doesnt receive them at anything nearly regular rates sometimes several seconds pass before the next clump comes in...p  pEdit2p  pTested on a Samsung Galaxy S3 today. On that the data are coming in at a much smoother rate than on either the Nexus4 or the SG S5 worst. Both Samsungs are emspammingem the logcat output, On the S5 its a system process with no useful information, but on the S3 it says BluetoothSocket.cpp readNative  I suspect the clumping behaviour of the sensor readings might be caused by the bluetooth system an input buffer maybe Does anybody know if its possible to alter the reading rate of the bluetooth inputbufferp

Unfortunately I cant even catch a SqlException if something goes wrong. Only IBatisException and Exception. p
Negative 134 pIm working on a problem that involves creating a graph which shows the areas of intersection of three or more circles each circle is the same size. I have many sets of circles, each set containing at least three circles. I need to graph the area common to the interior of each and every circle in the set, if it even exists. If there is no area where all the circles within the set intersect, I have nothing to graph. So the final product is a graph with little slivers of intersecting circles all over.p  pI already have a solution for this written in Python with matplotlib, but it doesnt perform very well. This wasnt an issue before, but now I need to apply it to a larger data set so I need a better solution. My current approach is basically a testandcheck brute force method I check individual points within an area to see if they are in that common intersection by checking distance from the point to the center of each circle. If the point meets that criteria, I graph it and move on. Otherwise, I just dont graph it and move on. So it works, but it takes forever.p  pJust to clarify, I dont scan through every point in the entire plane for each set of circles. First, I narrow my search area to a rectangle tightly bounded around the first two arbitrarily chosen circles in the set, and then testandcheck each point in there.p  pI was thinking it would be nice if there were a way for me to graph each circle in a set say there 5 circles in the set, each with an alpha value of 0.1. Then, I could go back through and only keep the areas with an alpha value of 0.5, because thats the area where all 5 circles intersect, which is all I want. I cant figure out how to implement this using matplotlib, or using anything else, for that matter, without resorting to the same brute force testandcheck strategy.p  pIm also familiar with Java and C, if anyone has a good idea involving those languages. Thank youp

Negative 134 pWe have a product with about 50 assemblies DLL files of which most are needed and loaded at startup of the main executable. The result is that even on a moderately fast machine, loading time of the assemblies and JITing them takes between 23 seconds, which is in our case an unacceptable overhead.p  pIf we load the program once and run it multiple times from the same, still running executable, the timings start at several ms. But for endusers this is not an option, they will run it from the commandline.p  pI would like to speed up the loading on first instantiating the executable. There is a small speedup between a cold start after reboot of Windows and a warm start, but only marginally so. What techniques or tools are available in .NET that we can use to speedup loading note we tried ILMERGE, which helps about 30 only and NGEN is not an option, it needs to be run at a variety of systems and architectures.p  pI was considering creating a service andor a specific CLR hosting environment, but hopefully there is a simpler, more trivial solution.

Negative 134 pIm trying to set up an nginx proxy in a way Im not sure will work... Basically, I have 3 servers running. Server A is an nginx reversed proxy. Server B and C are backend servers. When a client requests a hrefhttpdomain.comfile.jpg relnofollowhttpdomain.comfile.jpga, it hits Server A than passes the request back to Server B. The file could be on server B or C. If server B doesnt have the file, it sends a 301 redirect to the file on Server C. The problem with this is the 301 goes back to the browser and changes the URL in the client.p  pIm wondering if its possible to have the 301 stay internal. Nginx would see and follow the 301 to the correct file location on Server C, but the client wouldnt know the difference. The client shouldnt be able to tell whether the file is on B or C, or even know the addresses of them...p  pThanksp

Negative 134 pBecause Im using OpenGL I load admob adds  in the GL class and not in the one which is implementing this GL class.p  pThe case for now is that when going from lets say the LevelOverview  Level 1, the add loads when Level 1 starts and will show when I press the button to go back to the levelOverview. When I start level 1 again, the process starts again.p  pThe problem is that the activity level 1 stays in the background each time. So after 4 switches between LevelOverview  Level 1  levelOverview I have 4 activities in the background of level 1. This will cause an OOM error after a while.p  pI tried to everything to close the activity, for now I have it like thisp  precode        Intent ia  new IntentgetApplicationContext, LevelOverview.class     finish     super.onStop     onStop     texture1.dispose     texture2.dispose     startActivityia     displayInterstitial     interstitialnull codepre  pI even tried to dispose my textures to save space. However this is not needed I think.p  pThe memomory analyser shows that Admob is keeping references to all of these level 1 activities. However I cant get rid of these references. I tried to nullify the interstitial in several waysp  pHow can I delete the admob references so the GC can do his work on my old activitiesp  pUPDATE ANSWERp  pInstead of deleting my question I would like to answer the question for those who run into the same problem one time. What I did was the followingp  ol lipI took the Admob out of the GL class and put in a separate nonGL activity. One with a normal viewpli lipI changed my bitmap decoding from RGB8888 to RGB44444, which results in a major memory decrease  Result is that the GC has time enough to do the cleanup even though some references stay longer alive.pli ol  pI can finally call my game stable, and now really know the meaning of a stable program.p

Negative 134 pI am dynamically populating markers on Google map by getting data via ajax call to the server. Old markers are cleared and new markers are loaded whenever new data is received through ajax call.p  pEverything was working fine until I added histoty.js api to to make my webpage remember history and let users browse back using browser back button without reloading page and Google map. p  pI am saving parameters required for my ajax call along with map zoom and bound whenever I push state using history.js api so that I can set map bounds and zoom when user clicks back button. p  pSo whenever user clicks back button, I retrieve parameters for ajax call along with corresponding map bounds and zoom from browserstate. Then I use map bounds and zoom to set maps zoom and center. After that I populate markers received via ajax call.p  pIssue arises when more than 45 histories are created using history.js and user starts clicking back button. In such case, after 23 clicks, markers does not show up however if user slightly drag the map, then markers are visible.p  pPlease consider following points before answering the questionp  ul lipThere is no issue with the ajax call. I have checked it completely and I receive correct data whether its a new ajax call or a ajax call made using browserstate data of history.js.pli lipBack button using history.js works fine for retrieving data from server, setting map bounds and zoom but visibility of markers becomes an issue when more than 45 histories are created and then more than 23 times back button is clicked. There is no issue in creating history 5101000 or more times and retrieving corresponding data via browserstate.pli lipWhen markers are not visible when back button is clicked and user slightly drags the map, markers shows up as if Google map has data associated with markers somewhere in its variable but doesnt populate it. and yes, no new ajax call is madepli lipI have also checked the html that Google map creates for its map. Markers are nothing but divs created by Google map with margins corresponding to marker position. When markers are not visible, there are no divs. On slight drag I have observed that marker divs i.e. markers are populated immediately I would like to mention again that with this slight drag, no new ajax call is made and no new data is received from server. Its the same old data, which makes it quite clear that markers data is somewhere in Google maps variable but its not populating for some reason.pli lipLastly, I just want to mention that there is no other issue with webpage, new request works fine, markers show up all the time no matter 10, 20, 1000 or more new calls new calls mean parameters entered by user not the one fetched from browserstae of history.js api are made. Even for the back button click, there is no issue with history.js api. I receive all the old data using browserstate data, I can set the map bounds amp zoom, map is clearly visible and no other issue except marker visibility. I dont know whether its a bug or something else.pli ul  pstrongemI have tried to put all the information here, but if I am missing something then please ask me. I will share the required information.emstrongp  pemI forgot to add that it only happens when user drags map more than 45 times and history is created corresponding to each new map bound. If user doesnt drag map and history is created on the same map bound as loaded initially or within 23 drags of original load position, then there is no issue.emp

Negative 134 pcodeRandomAccesscode is a marker interface in Java used by codeListcode implementations to indicate they have fast random access to their elements. Since it is designed specifically for codeListcode implementations, why is not in the codeListcode hierarchy For example, consider the following method that requires a codeRandomAccesscode list as input and returns a random elementp  precodepublic ltE, L extends ListltEgt amp RandomAccessgt E getRandomElementL list ... codepre  pI must pass this method either an anonymous list or a list with declared type codeArrayListltEgtcode, a concrete class, rather than a list declared with some interface like codeListltEgtcode. However, if codeRandomAccesscode was parameterized and extended codeListltEgtcode, then my method could look likep  precodepublic ltE, L extends RandomAccessltEgtgt E getRandomElementL list ... codepre  pand I could pass it a list with declared type codeRandomAccessltEgtcode, which is an interface, rather than a concrete class. codeArrayListltEgtcode etc would just then implement codeRandomAccessltEgtcode, rather than codeListltEgtcode.p

Negative 134 pI have a project that uses emMSSQLem over pdodblib and freetds. MS scalar functions always returned their data in this formatp  precodearray1  [0]gt array1  [computed]gt string3 922  . codepre  pBut now, on one of the servers the format suddenly isp  precodearray1  [0]gt array1  []gt string3 922  . codepre  pSo the key in the array became empty instead of computed.p  pI know that I can change that key in my select statements by adding as clause. Still, the question is, what controls the default keyp  pBoth servers use the same database.p  pAs far as I know, this computed key is something thats added by pdodblib.p  pPHP version is different between servers, the one with computed has old 5.3, while the one with empty key has 5.5. But I think that this server had 5.5 for quite some time, while the computed key disappeared just yesterday. Not 100 sure though...p

Id love to be able to make things work against our current data without having to modify the schema.p  pI see that I can write a custom controller and service,  la a hrefhttpsgithub.comolivergierkespringrestbucks relnofollowhttpsgithub.comolivergierkespringrestbucksa, and this would let me handle the entityManager and flush in between. The problem I see going that way is that it seems that I lose the entire benefit of using springdatarest in the first place, which solves 99 of my problems with almost no code. Is there somewhere that I can shim in a custom handler for this operation without rewriting all the other operations I get for freep

Negative 134 pYesterday I posted a question about getting highcharts.JS to handle an issue when XML data was pushed to it. I didnt go very in depth so I think the answer I got was a bit off so I am going to try and repost it today and see if I can get an answer more suited to my issuep  pI have a Quickbase application that is being graphed to a highchart.js graph using XML data from an API call. The XML data is a table query bringing back record data from 14 fields. In those fields the data can range from .001 to 99.99, HOWEVER some of them will be blank from time to time producing an array of NaN,NaN,NaN, When that series is pushed into the graph it makes the whole graph blank until you deselect that optionp  pIt was suggested yesterday that Highcharts has a built in nodata function, however the only way I could find it explained was when there was an instance that there was absolutely no data being provided to the graph in which case it showed on the graph No Data, but that is not what I am looking for as there will always be at least one usually at least five, but for simplicity sake I will say one field having data.p  pHere is the code I am currently using p  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtGraphlttitlegt   ltscript

I think that the Turbo Boost of the used processors might be biasing the results. Apparently the Turbo Boost only becomes active when a few cores are used, but I am not sure how to interpret the results correctly.p  pTo turn off the Turbo Boost one possibility could be to modify the STREAM benchmark as followsp  ul liAlways use all 24 available cores to maintain the processor load approximately constant throughout the benchmarkli liSplit the MPI communicator codeMPICOMMWORLDcode of the benchmark into two separate ones. One communicator will be associated with the group of strongNstrong processes that actually run the benchmark, the other group contains the remaining strong24Nstrong processes that only have the purpose to keep the cores busy and prevent Turbo Boostli liThe strong24Nstrong processes only use data from the L1cache to minimize effects on the other processesli liExtend the time the benchmark runs to several minutes Turbo Boost effects do not last longer than a few secondsli ul  pA first implementation uses only the triad kernel for the remaining strong24Nstrong processes on a data set that should fit into the L1cache 32kByte.

I have come closep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfRLYb.png altenter image description herep  pIn this illustration, the dots you see are actually rotated text strings of lowercase os. It is done this way because I need the dot spacing to stay constant if the plot is rescaled. However, Id like something better than lowercase os, for example, filled dots instead of circles. This could be done if I could access the font that is used for the standard plotting symbols codepch  125code in the codeplotcode function and relatives. Then I could make a text string with that font and get whats needed. Does anybody know how to do thatp  pPS  No, a histogram with lots of bins is not an acceptable substitute.p

Negative 134 pI wanted to build a custom zlib DLL that includes the symbol table. I used MinGW and the DLL works correctly and indeed includes the symbol table but it has to be named zlib1.dll in order to work. I want to name it zlib1debug.dll to distinguish it from the regular stripped version. How can I inform my applications to load the renamed DLL I dont want to use the LoadLibrary function. I also made a libzdebug.a file from the object files used to create the DLL. When I compile an example program which is supposed to use the new DLL, I pass lzdebug to the linker. It compiles without errors, but it still wants to load zlib1.dll when I run it. I expected it would try to load zdebug.dll but apparently thats not how it works.p
Negative 134 pI have read all about Project.json file in ASP.NET 5vNext.  I have seen tons of people asking if the same changes can be applied to c projects currently using .csprojnuget.

I did see this blurp here a hrefhttpscode.visualstudio.comDocslanguagesc35httpscode.visualstudio.comDocslanguagesc35a   Selecting a project.jsonfile is opening a DNXproject and VSCode will load that project plus the referenced projects.

Negative 134 pI already have a user model and controller and a sessions controller. User can sign up and sign in from my app without facebook . However, I want to also integrate facebook login and make it work with the sign in and sign up, the user model, controller and the already programmed sessions.

I have been combing the API but am unable to locate anything. I need this data to produce various diagnostics based on the actual data used in the regression.p  pOf course, I could drop the correct rows myself before the regression, like thisp  precodeIn [58] lendf Out[58] 39243  In [59] df2  df.dropnasubsetvarnamey  varnamesx In [60] lendf2 Out[60] 38013  In [64] model  sm.OLSdf2[varnamey], df2[varnamesx],missingdrop          result  model.fit In [65] lenresult.fittedvalues Out[65] 38013 codepre  pThen the codeDataFramecode that I feed to the regression is already the one with all the missing observations removed.

Is there a better way to do this, particularly programmatically accessing the postregression codeDataFramecode via the codeOLScode model class or the codeRegressionResultsWrappercode output of the fitp

Negative 134 pI have an MVC5 View where I am using the Grid.MVC component a hrefhttpsgridmvc.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpsgridmvc.codeplex.coma. This allows me to easily display data from my Oracle DB and has out of the box functionality for SortingFiltering each Data Column. What I am trying to implement now is a Wildcard Search across all fields in my grid. For example, if I search the number 2 Id like to return all records that contain a 2 be they string, decimal, or DateTime.p  pThe filter capability on this grid performs filtering for individual columns partially by modifying the URL a hrefhttphomeURLgridfilterLocation.DEPT1accounting relnofollowhttphomeURLgridfilterLocation.DEPT1accountinga such as 1 being codeEqualscode, 2 being codeContainscode, 3 being codeStartsWithcode, and 4 being codeEndsWithcode and then after the next 2 underscores being the search criteria. p  pI first thought I was going down the right path by using JavaScript to modify to the desired URL via daisychaining all fields with the search criteria using a CONTAINS. I then noticed that codedecimalcode fields like [Cost] and codeDateTimecode Oracle DB fields like [AcquiredDate] have criteria settings of codeEquals, Greater Than, and Less Thancode, so I triedp  precodeSearchIcon.onclick, function e              window.location  window.location.href.substr0, window.location.href.indexOf             window.location  gridfilterFIELD12  document.getElementByIdSearch.value                                ampgridfilterFIELD22  document.getElementByIdSearch.value                                ampgridfilterCOST1  document.getElementByIdSearch.value                                 etc.  ALL FIELDS                               ampgridfilterNOTE2  document.getElementByIdSearch.value          codepre  pThis technically functions, but with the code[amp]code is searching for a records that have the corresponding search criteria in EVERY field. What I need is something similar, but with an OR code[]code conditioning  unfortunately the grid component does not contain this form of functionality.p  pI then thought to pass the search criteria to a controller action and use it via a multiWHERE clause and return only the records fitting the filter to my Viewp  precodepublic ActionResult SearchAssetsstring searchCriteria                       fillPagingIntervalList             var assetSearchResults  db.ENTITYCOLLECTION.Wherem gt m.ID.ToString  searchCriteria              m.Model.ToString  searchCriteria              m.COST.ToString  searchCriteria               etc.  ALL FIELDS             .FirstOrDefault             var assetCount  db.ENTITYCOLLECTION.ToList.Count             return ViewassetSearchResults          codepre  pThis resulted in an error with the WHERE cluase, stating to view the codeInner Exceptioncode for details  codeORA12704 character set mismatch MVCcode.

Negative 134 pI want to choose a particular decoder in decodebin from a list of decoders depending upon user options.p  pFor e.g. I have two decoders myh264dec and avdech264. I want to select one of the decoders depending on user input  type of decoder mydec or avdec. However, there is a possibility of either or both decoders not being present on the users system. p  pHence, doing this in codeautoplugselectcode is not an option since if I skip a factory, there might not be any more factories for that caps.p  pSo I have thought of implementing the autoplugsort callback where I can sort the factories according to the user input and select the first factory in autoplugselect.p  pHowever, when I iterate through the codeGValueArraycode of factories I get in codeautoplugsortcode, I get garbage data. codeGSTOBJECTNAMEfactorycode returns codeNULLcode.

Negative 134 pAs stated in the title  currently I have two applications. One is .NET, winforms and the second one is native C. Both work together and must communicate C to .NET and .NET to C, the .NET application is started from C application. Currently the communication is done by writing the data to a file and sending postmessage to inform C application that the data was written. Although it works, I dont think that this is the best way doing this. Because of that I would like to ask you, what would you recommend  as the best way. I am considering writing an CLI wrapper around .NET to bind it in C. Are there any drawbacks of using such wrapper in comparison to writing the data to filesp  pUpdatep  pIve forgotten to add that both applications always work on the same machine. The solution should work on Windows xp, win7, win8p  pConclusionp  pThanks a lot for your answers, all of them are very helpful.

Just a bit dubious about recreating an instance of our current WSS 3.0 setup.p  pCheersp  pUPDATEp  pSo I think I may have to rule sharegate out as an option after looking at prices.

If I cut and past the debug log message with the query that mybatis has prepared, replacing the  with a ta.id that contains the hyphen, into my database tool, I receive the proper result.p  pOther queries I have that look up data that has more than one hyphen return correctly.  The only time Im seeing a null result from mybatis is on the single hyphen data.p  pThis is against an Oracle 11 server. Ive tested this against mybatis 3.1.0 and 3.3.0p
Negative 134 pI am developing an AddIn for Outlook. Outlook 2013 deactivates AddIns if they take to long to start.

Negative 134 pi recently started learning JavaScript and been working on the final assignment for the class where we have to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. While i did manage to solve the same type of a game at codecademy.com  it was mostly with the help of several If Statements and 1 function. However, for this assignment were required to use functions, arrays and loops, while keeping a score of each players progress, notifying the user of the updated scores, as well providing the chance to exit the game at any time... heres the detailed explanation of whats required for this assignmentp  blockquote   pWrite a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Your task is to create the logic   for a Rock, Paper Scissors game. The game will welcome a user and then   prompt the user for their first round of play by asking them to type   rock, paper or scissors Each round will have the following stepsp      ol   liThe user will be prompted to type, rock, paper, scissors OR exitli   liThe computer will randomly pick either rock, paper or scissors       and alert the user to this choiceli   liA winner will be declared and a point will be awarded to the winner.li   liThe user will be alerted of the running score for both themselves and the computer.li   liThe round will be repeatedli   ol      pYou are to evaluate whether or not the user wins, loses or ties the   round, based on the rules here   a hrefhttpwww.rinkworks.comgamesrps.shtml relnofollowhttpwww.rinkworks.comgamesrps.shtmla The game should have an   infinite number of rounds, until the user types exit in the game   prompt. If the user types the word exit into a prompt, let the user   know who won the game and the final score. I will ultimately leave the   architecture of the program up to you, but do require that You will   need to incorporate conditionals, loops, arrays and make use of   function calls and comments to create this program.    the computer creates a new random choice between rock, paper and scissors by calling a function you create to return either   rock,paper,scissors    the logic for determining a winner of a round is contained inside a function you design to take both the user and computers choice as   parametersp blockquote  pI checked this in Chromes console for errors and the problem that im having is that the code seems to work... only that its the computer thats the only winner here... hence it seems as if the user input is completely ignored.

Negative 134 pIve added a Google Custom Search Engine to my site using the Google developers console Im not coding the API myself.

However, when I click on one of the search results and then want to go emback to the search results pageem, it goes instead to the root page of my site.  I came up with a quasisolution when I try to go back to the search results page, the URL of the search results page is siterootgsc.tab0ampgsc.qhappy20birthdayampgsc.sortdate If I manually edit that and add the page name before the query, so it looks like this siterootsearchresults.cfmgsc.tab0ampgsc.qhappy20birthdayampgsc.sortdate, then the results will load again. So I added some javascript to manually add the searchresults.cfm to the query string onload and that does usually work. However, if the user goes to the 2nd or 3rd page of search results or switches the sort type, it stops working.

Negative 134 pIn a few programming languages there is an active record concept. The same class supports both reading and writing CRUD.p  pI am now implementing my own active record.p  pWhile implementing it I thoughtp  pWhen reading, we read all fields which application code requests out of the set of all columns of a table.p  pWhen writing, we usually store a fixed subset all fields which were set by setters of all fields.p  pNote that the set of read fields is usually does not match the set of fields we are to write.p  pIt is at least in our company probably unusual that we read the entire record, modify it and store.p  pInstead it happens in such way as this We create a Web form with reading a record, the form is POSTed and then we store it into the DB with writing a record.p  pThis way code splits into two unrelated halves The first part only reads and the second part only writes. As such, why we need an object which can be both read and writtenp  pI suggest that there can be done two independent classes One for read only and the second for writing create of update only. Deleting by can be done with yet another class.p  pMy question Why typical active record implementations were designed to support both reading and writing Well, I anticipate the flow when some fields are read and then modified and store into the DB but even in this flow it can be done with a slight increase of the length of the program with two independent classes The first one used for reading and the second one for writing.p  pWhat are design decisions backing typical active records Are uses when it is useful to have both reading and writing in one class frequent Can you give examplesp

Negative 134 pI have a website under version control using GIT. I have a system set up that essentially, automatically deploys changes in my codemastercode branch to my production server. Namely, I have a webhook in my repository that triggers a PHP script that essentially initiates a codegit pullcode on the server in order to pull down changes.p  pMy issue lies in the fact that I currently have a configuration file codeconfig.phpcode that is tracked using git. Myself and another developer want to have our own codeconfig.phpcode files that are different to the file on the server, therefore we want to tell git to stop tracking this file and just pretend it isnt there.p  pWe decided first to test using a less important file, so we added codetest.phpcode to our code.gitignorecode file, hoping this would do the trick. Git was still tracking the file so I tried running codegit rm cached test.phpcode in an attempt to stop tracking the file. This seemed to work so we committed and pushed our changes.p  pTo my surprise, when our deployment script initiated the pull on our server we found that this file had been deleted from production. Thanksfully, the deleted codetest.phpcode was not important.p  pstrongTLDRstrong How can I tell git to ignore a file it currently tracks, have it untracked and deleted from my repository, but leave it intact on my production serverp

The issue I am having is after a period of time switching between the Tabs. This view, and this view alone, will no longer display. There seems to be no issue with the TabLayout as it is loading this class. I am hoping that someone might be able to provide some guidance in solving this issue.p

Negative 134 pI want to test code to show that it produces an codeEUSERWARNINGcode in certain circumstances.p  pI found a hrefhttpwww.sitepoint.comtestingerrorconditionswithphpunit relnofollowthis articlea which addresses the problem, so as I see it I have these optionsp  ol liCopying that code into every TestSuite which needs to test for warningsli liMaking a subclass of codePHPUnitscode TestCase that has that code, and have my tests inherit from thatli liUse composition, i.e. make a helper class that achieves the same.li ol  pI dont like 1, for obvious reasons  I cant imagine the author had that option in mind. p  pI dont like 2, because there are some tests that I might use a third party TestCase that already extends codePHPUnitscode TestCase, so it would get complicated or messy if I wanted to add that functionality for that subclass as well by subclassing that subclass.p  pOption 3 sounds the best. But...p  pstrongThis all seems to be reinventing the wheel.

Negative 134 pWeve made an WPF application with a traditional UI common controls like tabs, buttons, labels, textboxes, and so on.p  pWe need to add a night vision mode, which would make it look like Stellariums night vision mode, so that it can be comfortably used in places with few or just no light at all.p  pAs far as Ive seen, we only have two optionsp  p1 A technique called shading I dont know how this could be implemented in WPF. 2 The bruteforce way defining controls style templates. As you know, this would imply a tremendous work, since we need to redefine every single property for each control being used borders, background, brushes, etc, etc, etc.p  pThe question arep  p1 Whats the best way to achieve this in WPFp  p2 Would it be more complicated if we work with MahApps Metro Style I know MahApps lets you customize their style, but the problem then would be switching between to different templates the two used for day and night vision, respectively.p  pThank you very muchp
