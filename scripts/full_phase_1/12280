Positive 12280 pI have a jsp page which has the displays the status of various jobs that are running. Sone of these jobs are long running, so it takes a while for their status to change from processing to complete.p  pIs it a good idea to have a javascript function that would refresh the page every 30 seconds or so Are there any ramifications for having a script that is constantly refreshing a pagep  pThe other option is to have a refresh button which on click would refresh the page.p

Positive 12280 pI have a one page website, emexample.comem. There are two sections emintroem at the top of the page, and emcontactem at the bottom of the page. If I want someone to visit the emcontactem section without having to scroll through the emintroem, I give them this link emexample.comcontactem. Im talking about these visits below.p  pThe browser automatically scrolls down to the emcontactem section, but it ignores the fixed navigation at the top of the page, so the emcontactem section is scrolled behind the navigation so the top of the emcontactem section becomes invisible. This is what I want to correct using JavaScript, by subtracting the height of the fixed navigation from the scroll position. Lets call this function the codescrollCorrectorcode. The problem is that I dont know exactly when such an automatic scrolling happens, so the codescrollCorrectorcode isnt called everytime it should be.p  pWhen should the codescrollCorrectorcode be called When the automatic scrolling happens because of the hash portion. Why not to use codeonscrollcode Because this way I cant differenciate an auto scroll from a user scroll. Why not to use codeonclickcode on every codelta hrefexample.comcontactgtcode Ill use it, but what if a user navigates by the browsers back button Okay, Ill use codeonpopstatecode as well. But what if the user comes from emexample.comintroem by manually rewriting the URL to emexample.comcontactem  Okay, Ill use codeonhashchangecode as well. But what if the user is already on emexample.comcontactem, clicks to the address bar, and presses enter without any modification None of the above helps then.p  pWhat event should I listen to then If such an event doesnt exist, how could the codescrollCorrectorcode know that an automatic scroll has just happenedp

Positive 12280 pI am triggering a custom event on an element using jQuery and I want the event handler to be able to pass data in the form of an object back to the method that called it. The trigger and the handler are in different scopes and files and cannot be merged or shared in a conventional manner. The trigger method is part of a utility library I am writing and the event handler is part of my frontend view template.p  pstrongI know this code doesnt work,strong but I am writing it to kind of illustrate what I am hoping to try. The pattern is based of of work I have done in .NET.p  precodevar data   foo bar  element.triggersomeevent, data ifdata.foo  bar     alertsomeone changed foo codepre  pAnd the handler...p  precodeelement.bindsomeevent, functionevent, data      ifsomecondition         data.foo  biz  codepre  pThe specific implementation is not terrible important to me as long as I dont have rearrange my code to stick both the codetriggercode and the codebindcode in the same scope.p  pHow do I get return value back from my event handlerp  hr  h2EDITh2  pTo provide a little more context, the triggering method is responsible for obtaining and processing data, and finally rendering it out as markup to the page. Before it does that, it raises the custom event with the same processed codedatacode object so that other components of the app can have the chance to do something with the processed data. p  pIn certain cases, it would be beneficial for the event handlers to modify that set of data, or event signal to the triggering method that the data has already been handled and does not need additional processing or rendering.p  pSomething like below. In this example, the handler might change the way the data is displayed based upon some property value. It may also choose to render the data out a different way e.g. codeinputcode rather than the default rendering in the triggering function e.g. codelabelcode. p  pThis implementation is an example, but the end goals of returning an object from the handler, or modifying the data in the handler such that the triggering method can access it are common to my actual project.p  precodevar data  loaddata element.triggerloadingdata, data ifdata.abortrendertrue      element.appendltlabelgtFooltlabelgt     element.appendltspangt  data.foo  ltspangt  codepre  pAnd the handler...p  precodeelement.bindloadingdata, functionevent, data      ifdata.ispassword  true              data.foo     changed property persisted to triggering method and processed normally          ifdata.type  abc              element.appendltinput value  data.foo  gt         data.abortrender  true   signals to the triggering method that it should not render the data to the page       codepre

Positive 12280 pI have a simple, but complex issue. Im building a UI component in React.Js which uses knobs. The knobs can be turned from left to right like a physical knob can, and will render the appropiate knob heading North, South, etc, based off how much the user dragged their cursor all this happening in real time. So, Im listening for the onDragStart event to get the initial heading on the Yaxis  of the knob, and then adding the mouse move event to the documents event listeners, and taking the Yaxis movement from the mouse move event  in comparison to the initial Yaxis from the onDragStart event to find the Delta from the drag, and then render the appropriate image. The problem comes when I try to unregister the events from the document you know, good programming practices based off the mouse up event since the user will release the mouse button when reached their desired heading. Based off my attempt to print to the console whenever the mouse up event is heard by the browser, Ive come to the conclusion that since nothing is printed, the mouseUp event is not being heard, and as a result the dragStop method is not being ran. Ive pasted my code below in JS and JSX, and please dont hesitate to ask for a clearer explanation.

Negative 12280 pWe have a small daemon application written in C for a couple of various UNIX platforms this problem is happening in SunOS 5.10, that basically just opens up a serial port and then listens for information to come in via said port.p  pIn this particular instance, the daemon appears to read a single transmission like a files worth of data sent over via the serial port, then it receives a SIGINT.  This happens every time.  Other customers use this setup very similarly without receiving the SIGINT.  Quite obviously, the users are NOT pressing CtrlC.  We have a relatively simple signal handler in place, so we definitely know that that is what is happening.p  pWhat else could possibly be causing this  Googling around and looking through the questions here, I couldnt find much explanation as to other things that could cause a SIGINT.

Negative 12280 pHey everyone, whats a good way to do rpc across multiprocessing.Processes p  pI am also open to design advise on the following architecture  Process A  10, Process B  1. Each process A has to check with proces B on whether a particular item needs to be queried. p  pSo I was thinking of implementing multiprocessing.Pipe object for all the As, and then have B listen to each of them. However, I realize that Multiprocessing.Pipe.recv is BLOCKING. so I dont really know how I can go about doing this. if I use a loop to check which one has things sent through the other end that the loop will be blocked.p  pThere are suggestions for me to use twisted, but I am not sure how I should go about doing this in twisted Should I create a defer on each pipe.handler from all the processes A and then when recv receives something it goes on and complete a certain routine I know personally twisted does not mix well with multiprocessing, but I have done some testing on twisted that are child processes of an multiprocessing implementation and I think this time its workable.p  pAny recommendationsp

Negative 12280 pAfter thinking quite a while about how to make a fast and scalable web application, I am almost decided to go for a combination of Google App Engine, PythonDjango, and appenginepatch. But I came across a comment in the a hrefhttpcode.google.compappenginepatchwikiFAQ relnofollowappenginepatch FAQa that made me think that perhaps the combination is not quite as mature as I thought it may take seconds 14, according to the FAQ to boot an instance of Django. That may not be a problem if there is some persistance from request to request, but it seems that when there is no sustained traffic then the Django instance is shut down in a few seconds. If the system is not called every other second or so, any incoming request will take seconds to be granted. This is unacceptable. As a quick fix ugly, I know, I was thinking about having an external machine making a dummy request to the framework every second just to keep it alive. p  pDo you agree with this Do you have any other approachp  pAnother doubt that I have is what will happen if there is enough traffic to jump from one n servers to n1, will that request take seconds to be granted because a new Django instance has to be initiated or Googles infrastructure doesnt work this way I confess my ignorance on this. issue.p  pHelpp
Negative 12280 pI am porting Fortran code from Fortran PowerStationversion 4.0 to the Fortran 112003 compiler. The old compiler PowerStation has 53bit precision.

Negative 12280 pso I just recently yesterday started developing on the Android platform. So far I have created a Hello World application as described in their tutorial, but it does not run.

I need to access this field in the service codeOrderQuantityPackageShipServicecode. However, since it is of type codePackagecode I have to cast it it seems kinda kludgey.p  pMy question is, how do I implement this in a better fashion so I dont have to cast and also ensure typesafety So that if you are using codeOrderQuantityPackageShipServicecode, the package must be of type codeOrderQuantityPackagecode. I thought about using Generics, but it seems a little to kludgey for what I am trying to do codeShipRequestcode has a bunch of other attributes and it seemed strange to genericize it based on the type of package.p  pThanks.p

Negative 12280 pI know, I know. There are a million threads everywhere talking about problems with mapped drives. Ive ready many of them but I still cans seem to wrap my head around this problem or come to a solution.p  pI have a build servercontinuous integration server Win 2003 running CruiseControl.NET that listens to our source control server. When a change is detected, the build server gets the new code, compiles it, tests it and if successful, copies the files to one of our web servers. There are 6 web servers  3 Windows 2003 boxes, 3 LAMP boxes. Each OS has a separate development, staging and production box. All 6 web servers are mapped to a different drive on the build server. I have a Windows startup script that calls a few NET USE commands that set the stage for the deployments. p  pCCNET is the service that listens to SVN. However, CCNET calls NAnt to perform all of the actual processing and tasks compilation, testing, copying.p  pWhen I map the drives manually and run the NAnt scripts manually, everything works beautifully. When the startup script maps the drives and CCNET triggers the NAnt, the drives are nowhere to be found. I think the problem has something to do with user accounts. CCNET runs under the LOCAL SYSTEM account. I dont know what account the startup script runs under. Obviously manual execution runs under my account.p  pThe weirdest part is that at certain points in the past, everything was working great. I am not sure what changed. How can I get the mapped drives to be visible to all users and services Also, any other critique of any part of this setupprocess is welcomep

Negative 12280 pYesterday I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3419928jqueryreturnrandomvaluefromarraythis questiona which is answered but it lead to another problem. p  pI have the following code using jquery validation pluginp  precode       array of success messages and randomly select one     var messages  [Good, Great, Awesome, Super, Nice,Yay, Success, Ok, Perfect,Sweet ] function successMessagelabel  return messages[Math.floorMath.random  messages.length]  codepre  pThen my validation code success  p  precode...success functionlabel                  iflabel.hasClassvalid           label.addClassvalid.textsuccessMessage                     ... codepre  pWhat is happening is that each time the form is being valid on keyup or foucus it regenerates a success message. I figured since i was adding the class valid a logical step would be to check if the label has the valid class and is so dont add a message because it already has one. This however isnt working. Any other ideas would be great. p  pstrongEditstrong So after further research and thinking. Im pretty sure the problem is that the class of valid is being removed and added each time time form is validated on keyup, submit, etc I think the easiest thing to do may be to select the value of the label and look to see if the result matches the array, if so then dont do anything else add a success message. I could be wrong. I also dont think I articulated the question the best the first time.  It just looks silly to have the validation message change while the user is typing. p  pstrongEDIT 2strong After the many suggestions for clarification and example code I am posting this link a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYe3Ls20 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netYe3Ls20a if you type into a field until you get a success message then keep typing youll see what the problem is.

Negative 12280 pIm trying to display a number of images in an absolutely positioned div. The div has textalign set to center, which nicely puts the images in the center. I then added a marginleft rule with the adjacent sibling selector for the images, to give them a bit of space, but not messing up all the centering goodness.p  pImages are static inlineblock elements, as per default. p  precode.mydiv img  img      marginleft20px  codepre  pThis give my images a bit of space between eachother.

Negative 12280 pI am writing an executable which uses dlopen LoadLibrary on Windows to dynamically load a shared library. The shared library uses symbols from the executable.p  pIn Windows this is possible. Executables can export symbols declspecdllexport and .def files both work. The linker, when creating the .exe, also creates the .lib file the import library, so the DLL just needs to link with that .lib.p  pIn Linux, this is possible as well. I pass Wl,exportdynamic when building the executable so it exports its symbols.p  pOn Mac OS X, instead... Wl,exportdynamic does not work, but there is Wl,exportedsymbolslist,codeltfilenamegtcode where codeltfilenamegtcode is a list of symbols to export a sort of a simpler version of a .def file. But then, building the shared library is not as easy the linker complains about the unresolved symbols.p  pI tried a hack renamed the executable to libcodeltexecutablegtcode.dylib and, when linking the shared library, I passed lcodeltexecutablegtcode. But it gives the error cant link with a main executable.p  pThe general problem is that Linux shared libraries can have unresolved symbols, while Windows and Mac OS X do not allow it. But Windows has import libraries to resolve symbols against dependencies, and Mac OS X apparently does not...p  pHow can this be solved on Mac OS X Is there an equivalent of an import library the stub library created by the Windows linker when creating a .dll, so, if any module needs to dynamically link to the .dll, it is linked against the import library Or some other solutionp

Negative 12280 pI have another question, not sure if this would be accomplished via PHP or jQuery, so I am posting it in both sections.p  pBasically what I want is thisp  pI have several DIVs on a page, including 4 divs entitled Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.  p  pI have another DIV that is called Menu.  In the menu, you can toggle each of the four season DIVs via jQuery. There are also several list items, for example Ice Rinks and Ice Cream Stores.   Ice Rinks would only be available when Winter is selected, and Ice Cream Stores when Summer is selected.p  pWhat I would like to do, preferably via jQuery, is HIDE Ice Cream Stores from the menu when the Winter DIV is enabled, or HIDE Ice Rinks when the Summer DIV is enabled.p  pBasically, I need a way to either selectivly, or dynamically perhaps via a class on the list items assign the menu items to one of the 4 Season DIVS, and then hide those items from the Menu when the associated Season DIV is toggled off.   p  pIs this possible, and if so, does anyone have any code examples of how this would be accomplishedp  pThanks Zachp

Negative 12280 pIm a big fan of functional programming languages namely Standard ML and its dialects, mainly because of their expressiveness which allows for very consise, clean code.

I would definitely not wanna do that in a functional language.p  pThis brings us to my actual question strongIs there a good way to write a program in ML and then wrap it with a GUI written in Javastrongp  pWhat I have come up with so far is the following  p  ul liCompile the ML programm e.g. with MLton or Poly ML and execute the binary as an external program from Java httpwww.rgagnon.comjavadetailsjava0014.html.br strongProblemstrong The only way the FrontendBackend can communicate is via Strings.

With MLtons  a hrefhttpmlton.orgForeignFunctionInterfaceForeign Function Interfacea I can write an Interface to my functional program in C and statically link the whole thing.br strongProblemstrong Apparantly, this only works with dynamic libraries, that is dlls in Windows.

Negative 12280 pstrongUPDATEstrong I had asked this perfectly valid question in two Startup forums and everyone was pointing me to StackOverflow as its a highly technical question how to successfully architect such a system. To my astonishment here in StackOverFlow my question gets closed.  If its not allowed to be answered here, where shall I ask it then, on facebookp  hr  pRight now my software has reached the demo stage with only one main user or lets call it account. This main account is using several main tables and some lookup tables. Therefore whatever data is stored within these main tables it is basically meant to be for this one account.p  pBut a SAAS is meant to serve many accounts and each one obviously should only see its own data when opening the app.p  pHow do I architect it properly So that when the customer logs in successfully he would get only to see the data assigned to him and see only his colleagues from his company in a dropdown list etcp  pShould each main table get a userId and a companyId column and all CRUD queries should filter on that when inserting, deleting or selecting a rowp  pMany Thanks for your advice, Kavep

This guarantees that the   phone will not sleep until you have finished handling the broadcast.   Once onReceive returns, the Alarm Manager releases this wake lock.   This means that the phone will in some cases sleep as soon as your   onReceive method completes. If your alarm receiver called   Context.startService, it is possible that the phone will sleep   before the requested service is launched. To prevent this, your   BroadcastReceiver and strongService will need to implement a separate wake   lock policy to ensure that the phone continues running until the   service becomes available.strongp blockquote  pBut so seems that i need 2 wakelock vs just 1 wakelock using handler....is it truep

I hope the difference is now clear.p  pBtw my personal motivation is the year navigation of django admins default datepicker.

Negative 12280 pI have a menu system where I drag and drop menu items from a category into another container.  I am using Jquery tools scrollable to display one category at a time, allowing me to page through the categories.

Ive searched the web and was recommended the following but it didnt work.p  precode.menuitem.mousedownfunctionmenuitem1.appendTobody codepre  pThe problem with this is that as soon as I drag the menuitem,  It zooms down to the bottom of the body making dragging a bit difficult.

Negative 12280 pIs it O.K. to define virtual function of class template outside its body Virtual function can not be inlined, but to avoid multiple definitions in compilation units they shall be marked codeinlinecode assuming that template headers will be included in multiple source files. On the other hand compiler is free to ignore codeinlinecode, so this seems valid. By an example, is the code below correctp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class C  public     virtual void fT val   template lttypename Tgt inline void CltTgtfT val    definition  codepre  pp  pBTW gcc 3.4.2 allows to omit codeinlinecode before definition of function codefT valcode but not before analogous function of regular class.

Negative 12280 pI have started with my first rails project using Redmine. I have started to dig into the code to get a better idea and having a hard time understanding the erb files. When I go to make a simple change to the welcome.html.erb file, I make the change and check in the browser and there is no change. Once I save a file is there something that I need to run before the view will be updated I did not think so, but that is why I am here asking because the view will not update the page when I save the file.p  pThank you in advance for any help.p  pUPDATE After I update the .html.erb file and open it up again in vim, my changes are still there. Only problem is that the page does not reflect what the change has been made to and when I view source it is not there eitherp

Negative 12280 pIm making a simple grails plugin thatll act as central configuration for our companies various projects logging. The general idea is that you simply add the plugin to your project, and itll inject the various appenders to the root logger.

This works fine if I just set the values in a Config.groovy of another project but obviously that defeats the purpose of this plugin.p

Negative 12280 pFor unit testing is it better to mock the data layer or use an embedded database like derbyp  pI know that it also depends on the purpose of the testing. But if I go with derby I dont have to mock all the objects and I assume that would be easier. On the other hand I understand that that is more towards integration testing. So which one is more common for unit testingp  pThanks.p  pUpdate according to comments p  pSo I have derby configured now but my manager insists on using easymock. We are using jpa and we have about 20 tables  data models. So then for each method like for project model should I specify the return type of the mockedProject for all its methods Like getProjectName, getProjectId, etc And also should I mock the persistent manager object. I thought that is just a lot in comparison with just configuring an embeded db like derby. p

While this does create a SQL script for the tables and constraints, it does not generate SQL for the triggers.  p  pI also understand that I can right click on each trigger in the database and select the Generate SQL Script option but, there is currently 46 tables under audit For Insert, Update, and Delete.  p  pRather manually generate an insert, update, and delete trigger script for each of the 46 tables, is there an easier way to do this  Or, should I start clicking, copying, and pastingp

Negative 12280 pI am trying to preprocess biological data to train a neural network and despite an extensive search and repetitive presentation of the various normalization methods I am none the wiser as to which method should be used when. In particular I have a number of input variables which are positively skewed and have been trying to establish whether there is a normalisation method that is most appropriate.p  pI was also worried about whether the nature of these inputs would affect performance of the network and as such have experimented with data transformations log transformation in particular. However some inputs have many zeros  but may also be small decimal values and seem to be highly affected by a logx  1 or any number from 1 to 0.0000001 for that matter with the resulting distribution failing to approach normal either remains skewed or becomes bimodal with a sharp peak at the min value. p  pIs any of this relevant to neural networks ie. should I be using specific feature transformation  normalization methods to account for the skewed data or should I just ignore it and pick a normalization method and push aheadp  pAny advice on the matter would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 12280 pHere is the scenario  I have two jQuery Mobile popups only one of which is shown at a given time and the other may not have been shown up to that point.  Each of those popups have jQuery Mobile selects given distinct dummy classes to help me find them.  What I need to do is this  before the popup is closed and I do so programmatically via popupclose I want to reset the selects to show their first value which is the default.  Easy, I thought. Just issuep  precode.selector.val0.selectmenurefresh codepre  pHowever, do this and you end up with the error cannot call methods of selectmenu prior ot initialization.  I imagine this happens because the other popup too has selects with the same class and they have not been initialized at that point.p  pUsing a different dummy class for the other select is not really an option since I am using the same event handling code for the two popups which are closely related.p  pI also triedp  precodepopupid.find.selector.val0.selectmenurefresh  codepre  pbut the results were similar.  Surely, there is reliable way to get all the child items of a given class and work on them  I thought I had just that with find but it looks like it is not the case.  The other option would be to establish if each item returned after the initial query has been initialized but that does not seem to be too easy either.  Id much appreciate some help with this one.p

Negative 12280 pThis is on Linux but ideally Id like a POSIX compliant solution.p  pI have two threads each of which is able to write to a hardware bus via an API function. Only one thread is allowed to write to the bus at any given time, and after a bus write, the bus must not be written to for a given time of the order of several hundred milliseconds. p  pBoth threads are implemented as state machines.p  pThe obvious solution is to use a mutex to serialise access to the bus, set a counter or timestamp, and have the state machine unlock the mutex after the appropriate time has expired. p  pThis seems a little fragile to me. If a future maintenance developer incorrectly modifies the state machine, the mutex might not get released, causing hardtodiagnose deadlocks. p  pIs there an API call that locks a mutex, but automatically unlocks it after a given timeout Google reveals pthreadmutextimedlock, but this isnt quite the same thing. p

Negative 12280 pI have a page what contains a long running Ajax request on loading one of its element a 3rd party grid component. This Ajax request delays the firing of the ready event on the document. I use jQuery UI plugins button, dilog. I used to apply them on elements inside the document.ready handler, but now in this case until the Ajax process finishes, I see lots of pure, unformatted ugly elements. The request could take up to 45 seconds, so it is quite annoying. What could be a good solution for this scenariop  pI could probably hide the corresponding elements until the request finishes, and then show them, but I would prefer some more generic technique if there is any.p  pIn addition, unfortunately I dont have too much control over this component, so I cannot control when and how it is loading its data.p  pEDIT The request delaying the ready event is of course not an Ajax request, it is the long processing of the components MVC partial view. But the problem still exists, because the other parts of the page above this area loads earlier.p  pEDIT Im working in ASP.NET MVC3, probably some output buffering technique would help, which would prevent flushing any content until the whole request is processed something like obXXX functions in PHP.p

Negative 12280 pIm trying to write a test using codeunittestcode for a simple Python program. It is an interactive program, specifcally it will be a textbased game, for now basically a port of World of Zuul to Python.p  pSo now I want to do good testdriven development and write a test and make sure that when the user inputs command x, that y results happen. Example when the user inputs quit, I want the program to end. I want to ensure that behavior. The only problem is, I cant seem to think of a way to give my own program input without actually typing that input into the shell, so I cant think of how to write a test for this.p  pCurrently, I have embedded the program in its own thread... I was thinking this would allow me to asynchronously give it input, but I still dont see how this can be done.p  pIs there a way to programmatically and dynamically give my own program input ... Like, using codestdincode or something If so I am thoroughly confused, and would appreciate an example.p  pFinally, if I am on the wrong track here, please tell me, because I am new to both Python and testdriven development, and I would appreciate any suggestions.p

Negative 12280 pI have a VS 2012 MVC 4 web role project and I successfully call a powershell script from the bin directory of the role, after I run codeSetExecutionPolicy Unrestrictedcode from a startup cmd. The script contains some azure cmdlets and when I run the project locally the script works perfectly. However when I publish the project on Azure, the same azure cmdlets in the script do not run. For examplep  precodeparam[string]websiteNameitudkcloudqwerdfs, [string]serverLoginuser, [string]serverPasspaSS123, [string]locationNorth Europe   Create new Website   website  NewAzureWebsite Location location Name websiteName  if website eq null      throw Website creation error     exit  codepre  pcreates an Azure website successfully when run locally but throws and exits when published and run from the cloud service.p  pOf course I googled around for a solution and I found that I have to preinstall Azure Powershell to the Web Role in order to run Azure cmdlets there. To do that, I installed the web platform installer 4.5, copied its command line tool executable with the Microsoft.Web.PlatformInstaller dll and my Azure publishsettings file to my Web Roles bin folder and I created a cmd that installs the Azure Powershell from webpicmd to a special folder in the Web Roles bin directory and imports my publishsettings file on Web Role startupp  precodemd dp0appdata cd dp0appdata cd..  reg add hku.defaultsoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrentversionexploreruser shell folders v Local AppData t REGEXPANDSZ d dp0appdata f  dp0WebpiCmd.exe Install AcceptEula ProductsWindowsAzurePowershell logdp0WindowsAzurePowershell.log  reg add hku.defaultsoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrentversionexploreruser shell folders v Local AppData t REGEXPANDSZ d USERPROFILEAppDataLocal f  powershell ImportAzurePublishSettingsFile exit b 0 codepre  pIt still didnt work, so I remotely logged in to the instance to see for myself what could be wrong. I tried to run the cmd script above and it required the .NET Framework 3.5 feature enabled, which looks weird to me since the instance already has the .NET 4.5 feature enabled by default Windows Server 2012. Anyway, I enabled it from the server manager and the script ran successfully with no errors. I opened the powershell and I tested some Azure cmdlets and they worked.

Negative 12280 pI pass a variable with  a value of millivolts acquired by a microprocessor connected via serial port, to a class in my app. The class has to compare the received value milliV to many values corresponding to 10 C increments.

When the value of milliV is lower than a specific value, then an integration calculation is made between the top and bottom closer values and returns a new value tempEx.p  pThis class is working and returns the correct value but I think that beside ifif else and switch, there should be better way to achieve the same result.

Negative 12280 pIm design an analytics page for a product, and I want to show the average time spent on the product. I want to show the average time for the past hour, past day, past week, past year, and all time. Is there a better way to get the result than going through all user records and calculating the average on the flyp  pThere are many similar problems in implementing analytics, since by giving user the power to specify an arbitrary time range, the app can no longer just store precomputed values in database e.g. store day average for each day in the past and use them directly. I can certainly just have  A Loading... please wait page while retrieving the data and calculating, just wondering is there a faster way to calculate thesep  pThanksp

Negative 12280 pIm working on a group of functions that are probably easier to manage on their own, just in a module.  But there are reasons beyond my paygrade that would like to think about turning this into a class.  But, since its converting from a polynomial input as a string, the regex works on a string but once the input is a class instance then it just decides to quit after that.  p  pSo my question is how to turn this into a class and still maintain the functionality how to initialize it, etc.  Or if this case is better suited to being a module then I can argue that but I need to understand fully.

Negative 12280 pIm trying to put some styling in my listbox, when the listbox is created it has the size for one item and when the mouse is over, it should increase its height to fit 5 items, so far so good, but since it becomes annoying when the user pass the mouse over it to go to another field, it gets annoying seeing it growing and returning to its original size.p  pSo I decided to try Storyboards with DoubleAnimation for this ListBox.

Perfect, Im almost feeling pro already. But when I went for the tests, I got problems. When the mouse is not over anymore, the listbox wont go backto its original size. So I decided to do the opposite and try to use codePropertyIsMouseOver ValueFalsecode with the codeFromcode and codeTocode values switched. The ListBox wouldnt move.p  pSo I tried an answer I saw in StackOverflow saying about codeDataTemplate.Triggerscode but got the same result.p  pI dont know what else to try since my lackof knowledge in WPF gets in the way everytime.p  pWhat is a good alternative for this Thanks in advance and opinons are always welcome.p

Negative 12280 pI am using Selenium WebDriver to get the content of a site. Note the site has no API. Wish it did. The site uses AJAX to dynamically load content when the user scrolls. To get that content, Ive been using Javascript  to scroll down and then trying to access the content using findElements.p  pTo be clear about the setup, the page contains several nested elements, one of which is a div with the GridItems class no name or id. This div contains many child elements with the Item class again, no name or id, just the class. I want to get every element with class Item in the div. About 25 items are accessible when the page first loads not necessarily visible in the current window, but available in the DOM, and scrolling down loads more. p  pMy main issues are as follows first, I want to stop scrolling when I get to the bottom. However, I cant figure out what stopping condition to use. How can I determine when Ive reached the bottom of the page Window.scrollheight wont work, because that will give the height of the existing window, not what it will be after its finished adding more content. Ive thought of testing if an element at the bottom of the page is visibleclickable, but if its not, it may be just because it hasnt loaded yet, not because it hasnt been reached. Even using a Wait may not work because if it times out, I dont know if its because it hasnt reached the bottom, or just because its taking a long time to load.p  pThe second problem is that when I scroll down, it loads some more elements, but eventually, scrolling down loads more from the bottom and drops the top ones of the DOM. This means that I cant just scroll down to the bottom and then use findElements to get all Items, because many of the first ones will be gone. I know how many items to expect, so currently, Im doing the followingp  precode    int numitems  135     ListltWebElementgt newitems     ListltWebElementgt allitems  new ArrayListltWebElementgt50      do          scroll down the full length of the visible window three times         forint i0 i lt 3 i                      scroll down             js.executeScriptwindow.scrollTo0, document.body.offsetHeight                    check how many items are now available   if it runs too fast, it may get to the next line before it finishes scrolling   make it wait until the desired div is visible      WebElement cont   new WebDriverWaitdriver, 100 .untilExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocatedBy.classNameGridItems          get all Items in the div         newitems  cont.findElementsBy.classNameItem       add all the items extracted after scrolling 3 times to the list            allitems.addAllnewitems      repeat until there are more items in the general list than are expected     to be found. This is hacky I wish there was a better stopping condition     whilenumitems gt allitems.size  codepre  pThat is, I scroll the page three times, get all elements available after the scrolling, and add them to a list. I repeat this until there are more elements in the list than I was expecting to be found. p  pThe problem with this is that since scrolling adds a different number of items to the DOM each time, there is often overlap between what is added to the allitems list at each iteration. The Elements are just objects with unique ids an contain no information about the actual HTML, so I cant check if theyre duplicated. I may also lose some items if the scrolling doesnt overlap perfectly. Also, since Ive scrolled down, the earlier items in the list that have fallen off the top lose their connection to the DOM and then I get a StaleElementReferenceException when I try to process them. p  pI can process each item as I get it, I suppose, though it will make the code clunky. This will also allow me to check its actual content and find the duplicates. Im not sure that this will ensure that I dont skip any.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for how best to do this Am I missing something very importantobvous here The other questions here on SO about AJAX content loading address somewhat different problems. e.g. I generally dont have an issue with content not loading and having to wait for it, though I did include a Wait. It seems that there should be a better way of doing this  is therep  pSorry for the longwinded post I hope it was clear.p  pThank you so much,  bsgp  h2Edith2  pI realize that the accepted answer only answers part of the question. For the rest of it, I found that scrolling down one screen at a time and getting all new elements each time meant that I didnt lose any. After each scroll, I got all elements loaded and did some processing to save the content of each one. This introduces a lot of redundancy, which I used a HashSet to eliminate. I stop scrolling when I reach the bottom, as determined by the code in the accepted answer. Hope this helps.p

Negative 12280 pI added a codeUIDatePickercode programmatically, and I set it as the codeinputViewcode and codeinputAccessoryViewcode of a codeUITextFieldcode so that the date picker pops up instead of the keyboard when selecting the text field.p  pThe date picker pops up however, the only problem is, it shoves the rest of the view up, thus hiding the codeUITextFieldcode that is being changed since the text field is at the top of the screen.p  pstrongIs there any way to prevent this unwanted shoving from occurringstrong Or could I somehow anchor the view in place in the codetextFieldDidBeginEditingcode method and unanchor the view in the codetextFieldDidEndEditingcode method Note I tried setting the view to the top of the screen in the codetextFieldDidBeginEditingcode method by doing codeself.tableView.contentOffset  CGPointMake0, 0code however this did not do anything, and I think this is because this occurs before the view is shoved upp  pIf it helps, the delegate view is a codeUITableViewControllercode. I am aware that codeUITableViewControllercodes are pretty restrictive, and maybe this is why it is acting up however it wasnt letting me use static cells unless I put them in a codeUITableViewControllercode so I had to choose it by default.p  pThanks Any help would be appreciatedp

Apply Changes Save 7.    mContext.SaveChanges codepre  pAll this because, I dont want to make a request to server each time to get whole child entity and anyway, I only have childs ID comes from a checkboxlist. This is part a loop, in a loop and may have to load a hundreds of children for each first level loop. In my point of view, it is possible to do that as Entity Graph should know that when it comes the time to save the parent and codeN..Ncode relation, he should only insert Parrent.nId and Child.nId in DB mapping table between child and parent... so it should not need entire childs graph.p  pAm I right Is it possiblep

A lot of his code is written in such a specific way that its hard for us to know if he actually knew what he was doing, or just didnt at all.p  pThe reason Im asking this question is because I see what he was doing here, but Im not sure if it works, or what the point of it really is.p  pThe first question I have is When AreaModels constructor is called, does Client.GetAreaHeaders get called Because I see why it might, but Im not entirely convinced that it actually does. I placed a breakpoint inside GetAreaHeaders on the service side, which should have triggered if it got called, so Im leaning towards saying No, it does not get called... but Im not sure my breakpoints were actually correctly done or hitting I just set this service up in IIS, I had no reason to debug it before, so I wanted to know from someone more familiar, should it have been called and why, or why not. Because I can tell from this code that the guy who wrote it definitely expected that it was going to be called.p  pIt looks to me like he was thinking about the idea of implementing some sort of cache of the result of the service call, but never really got around to saving it anywhere useful Because when he tries to read it, isnt GetAreaHeaders just going to get called a second time. So my second question if anyone is familiar is, does it even make sense to cache something like this, if it were fully working When the model gets recreated on every page load, why would it be better to have Areas prepopulated at Model creation, versus just accessing it once in the ViewController and storing it in some variable that is within the scope of the page To me it seems like they would take the same amount of time.p  pI hope this question is well explained and makes sense. Please let me know if there is any way I can edit the question to be more beneficial to everyone.p
Negative 12280 pIm currently working on a website which in future will be responsive. The site is primarily made up of images which in turn load into a FancyBox when clicked. v2 of FancyBox is now responsive and so resizes the images etc when screen size changes. As part of my design I have two fixed banners which appear at the top and bottom of the page, see image belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFzQfg.jpg altFixed position demo p  pBy default there is a margin around the FancyBox so that its styled nicely. However, with the fixed positioning that Ive added to the banners I need to increase the top and bottom margin. Ive looked through the JS source but I cant for the life of me find where I should be adding extra margin. There are all sorts of margins on the transitions etc which I think is where Im getting confused. p  pIn theory I just need to add x amount of pixels to the margin, where x is the height of the banners. As an aside Im not sure how I would replicate this in a responsive design, as the banners may be slightly shallower on a mobile. Adding the margin would mean theres a slight gap between the image and the banner, where currently the image goes behind the banner. See the following image for what Id like it to look likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comol4wx.jpg altenter image description herep  pId appreciate any thoughtsexamples of where this has been done before. p  pThanks in advance, Adam. p

Negative 12280 pI have a question about style and best practices.p  pIf you have an html page with a lot of buttons connected to functions, would you rather set the onclick functions inside the input tag of the button, or would it be better to create a handler controller in Javascript that attaches onclick handlers to each buttonp  pI forgot to mention that the onclicks would be attached to a call to an existing function.

Negative 12280 pI have a bitmap of temperatures across the US that gets displayed as a map overlay. That part works fine the Bitmap temperature overlay sits perfectly on the map relative to borders and geographic points.p  pMy goal is to be able to tap this temperature bitmap and then output the temperature based on that pixel color. The Bitmap overlay is getting scaled and positioned based on the current map projection. My solution to getting the bitmap pixel when tapped requires me to go backwards with a geopoint, account for scaling, and then retrieve the tapped point from the original bitmap image.p  pThe tapping works fine but I have noticed inaccuracies as far as which pixel is retrieved. For example I can tap below the visible part of the bitmap like in mexico and still return a colored pixel Conversely at the top of the map near Canada I can tap on the visible bitmap and not return any pixels. It is as if the returned pixel values are all shifted south by about 50 miles. The errors arent huge or obvious when zoomed out but when zoomed in they become obvious as obviously wrong pixel temperature values are returned.p  pI think my method is sound but I am wondering if the large numbers I am dealing with are causing problems with doubles. Do I need to switch to BigDecimal no experience there or some other number format Is there a better way to do thisp  pCODE BELOWp  precodepublic class BitmapOverlay extends Overlay   Bitmap bmp Bitmap bmp2 Context mContext GeoPoint upperLeft GeoPoint lowerRight Paint paint Paint lpaint Point ppupperLeft Point pplowerRight Rect src Rect src2 Rect dst int frame int complete100  boolean shadow AnimationDrawable animation ImageView radarView  Double W129.357400913 1E6 Double S23.560962423770285 1E6 Double E64.6787004566 1E6 Double N50.3092170302897 1E6  Projection currentProjection  boolean mExternalStorageAvailable  false String fullPath  boolean running  public BitmapOverlay Context freshContext      paint  new PaintPaint.FILTERBITMAPFLAG      paint.setAntiAliastrue     paint.setFilterBitmaptrue     paint.setDithertrue        String state  Environment.getExternalStorageState      if Environment.MEDIAMOUNTED.equalsstate       We can read and write the media     mExternalStorageAvailable  true      Log.iisSdReadable, External storage card is readable.       else if Environment.MEDIAMOUNTEDREADONLY.equalsstate       We can only read the media     Log.iisSdReadable, External storage card is readable.     mExternalStorageAvailable  true      else       Something else is wrong.

Negative 12280 pHello fellow Android codersp  pstrongProblemstrongp  pI need to download 50 images. The problem is, that the user cant use the app while they are downloading and it is bad for the users experience. p  pstrongIntentionstrongp  pI thought it would be a good idea, to use Universal Image Loader to download the images while using the app. The problem I have now is that I dont know how to use it together with AsyncTask. Im using AsyncTask because Im only loading the first 10 Results and then, when the user scrolls to the end of the code it loads the next 10 results.p  pIm using an AsyncTask inside a Fragment for that.p  pstrongProblem encounteringstrongp  pThe problem Im encountering is how to implement the Universal Image Loader correctlyp  pstrongApproachstrongp  pWhat I did so far is to add the ImageLoader library to libs and add it as a library. Then, I created a new class with this contentp  precodepackage de.activevalue.ttflies  import android.app.Application import com.nostra13.universalimageloader.core.ImageLoader import com.nostra13.universalimageloader.core.ImageLoaderConfiguration    Created with IntelliJ IDEA.

I didnt add it as an Activity. I added it just as a name. p  pBut now Im encountering a problem. The documentation states to use it like that if I understood it correctlyp  pcodeimageLoader.loadImageimageURL, ImageViewcodep  pThe problem here is, that I cant use this in the doInBackground method since I cant change the layout there. So I would have to do that in the onPostExecute method, but Im encountering problems. So I would like to hear a solution on how to use this Universal Image Loader in combination with an AsyncTask in Android.p  pAs I said I included the libraries, edited the Android Manifest file and created a class for the Application. But what nowp  pWhat do I put in the onCreate method of the Fragment Where do I initialize the imageLoader I dont really know where to do what in my classFragment, where I need the imageLoader.p  pAny suggestions on how I could solve thatp

Negative 12280 pI recently started to use the data.table package to identify values in a tables column that conform to some conditions. Although and I manage to get most of the things done, now Im stuck with this problemp  pI have a data table, table1, in which the first column labels is a group ID, and the second column, o.cell, is an integer. The key is on labelsp  pI have another data table, table2, containing a single column cell.p  pNow, Im trying to find, for each group in table1, the values from the column o.cell that are in the cell column of table2. table1 has some 400K rows divided into 800 groups of unequal sizes. table2 has about 1.3M rows of unique cell numbers. Cell numbers in column o.cell table1 can be found in more than one group.p  pThis seems like a simple task but I cant find the right way to do it.

Negative 12280 pI have a boss thread that spawns up to M worker threads. Over the lifetime of the program, workers may be added and removed.

Negative 12280 pi have been trying to  get motion data from a bvh file and applying it to my 3d models.I made study about bvh file format, and parsed its data and written the data in a text file, lets give the new extension .motion for the text file. Everything is fine, but problem arises when i try to apply .motion data to my 3d models joints.p  h3Because the rest pose of the bvh file differs.My models rest pose is TPose,but bvh files is standing pose.So the whole animation sequence applied in my 3d model also differs in its rotation.h3  ppi also verified whether the rotation data is applied to the correct joint or notpp  pso everything is perfect except the rest pose. is there any other way to overcome this rest position difference.

After the authentication I set the following cookiesp  precoderes.cookieuser, req.body.lguser.username,  signed true  res.cookiewatcher, o,  signed true  codepre  pAnd look em up afterwards p  precodereq.signedCookies.user  undefined codepre  pIs the signed attribute securep

When I couldnt find any way I could do this on an actual phone some people were able to achieve this in some specific simulator versions, but that makes no sense in the case of a camera based app I even started to think about modifying the built in camera application, but I think it would require recompiling the whole OS.p  pI downloaded the GAIA source from github, and tried to install a slightly modified version of the camera app to the phone, but although it started up, there was a blank space in the place off the live view and it did not work at all.p  pI would really appreciate any working methods to achieve this, or even some ideas on what I could try.p  pI would also welcome any guides telling me how could I do this with GAIA.p  pThanks in advancep

The idea behind the clickable points is just to have a pop up that explains some information.p  pI am able to scale the 100 width  100 height of my background image canvas and it works fine on various devices, but I have images that sit on top of my canvas, and as I scale it down, the canvas scales down ok, but my clickable image does not stay in its exact location. It remains relatively close to its original location, but I need it to stay in its exact location, and also to the scale that the page is being viewed at.p  pI would really appreciate any help  examples please.p  pThanks for any help provided.p  pAlso, please see my link to the page universityp  pa hrefhttpwww.bbk.ac.ukdmcken03HS2index.html relnofollowHS Web Linkap

Negative 12280 pI am new to Bootstrap, and started out with v3. I am trying to figure out if there is a way to change the alignment of text or images based on which grid size is in effect.p  pI am designing a footer and it has three columns. The left columns content is leftaligned. The center columns content is centered in its column. The right columns content is rightaligned. This makes a balancedlooking, pleasing footer on all display sizes other than a phone display. On a phone extrasmall grid, I want these three columns to stack and have all of the content centered even though some of the content is leftaligned or rightaligned at larger display sizes. Right now in my design, they are stacking, but the LCR alignment is making it look terrible.p  pIs there a way to do this, to change the alignment of text by size of grid thats in effect Please assume I may just not have a basic understanding about something as I am so new to Bootstrap and am not a superexperienced CSS person either.

Negative 12280 pIm working on a .NET 4.0C project. Ive enabled few basic code analysis rules for my project. Im hit by CA1008. I fully understand why a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms18214928vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowCA1008a is necessary.p  pThe software Im working on communicates with other devices. Those devices are configurable. The configuration is stored in internal EEPROM. One of the configuration is codeAlarmTypecode, in EEPROM which can have a value of 1 to 11. Ive defined the alarm type as followsp  precodepublic enum AlarmType      Type1  1,     Type2  2,     Type3  3,      ...     Type10  10,     Type11  11  codepre  pWhen configuring the devices, Im allowing the user to select one of the alarm types by fetching alarm values using codeEnum.GetValuescode. When inspecting the value in EEPROM, the requirement is like if the value is from 1 to 11, then show the name of the alarm, otherwise consider it codeType1code.p  pVisual Studio 2010 throws a warning stating that codeAlarmTypecode should have a value equals to zero. I dont want to add this because that will 1 violate the definition of codeAlarmTypecode codeAlarmTypecode cant be codeNonecode and 2 an extra checking will be necessary to exclude codeNonecode option when enumerating enum values to present to user.p  pInstead of suppressing CA1008, what can I do as a workaround Have I done something wrong in my designp

Negative 12280 pI am debugging complex application with GDB on CentOS 6. It uses custom GCC version not system one which is obsolete. This application constists of 3 projects 2 static libraries one is 50 M in size and another one is 10 M in size in debug build and executable file that uses code from these 2 libraries, as well as a lot of system shared libraries. The problem is that GDB is extremelly slow. I understand that this project is big, but Visual Studio 2013 debugs it very quickly, so may be GDB is not correctly set up to work with that big project.

Negative 12280 pThe full scope of my specific issue is likely too deep to include in a question here. Instead I am looking for clues.p  pThe nature of the problem has to do with codeoverflow hiddencode. In Internet Explorer 11 it is working sometimes and at other times not. I have an element that is larger than the body and I have set the body element to codeoverflow hiddencode. Sometimes the page loads and works exactly as expected, but in about 60 of my tests the browser just ignores this property. If I look in the inspector the property and value are present, yet are not having any affect on the rendering of the page.p  pI have tried using a container element instead of the body, but the same thing happens. opening the inspector panel while scrolled to the top of the page will sometimes fix the issue. Any ideasp  pThere is a lot going on with this layout which is why there is no fiddle. Everything else works fine in IE. There are no errors in any browser and the layout works perfectly in all other browsers I have tested Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera and IE 11.p

Negative 12280 pI am working on a code where it will do Linux command piping. Basically in my code, it will parse the user input command, then run it using the codeexecvpcode function.p  pHowever, to do this, I would need to know the command, as well as its parameters. I have been trying to get the parsing to work correctly, however, it seems that when I do a test case, the output from both of the arrays that store their respective programs is the same. The commandsparameters are stored in a char array called codeprgname1code and codeprgname2code.p  pFor instance, if I were to run my program with the parameter codeps aux  grep [username]code, then the output of prgname1[0] and prgname2[0] are both [username]. They are supposed to be codepscode and codegrepcode, respectively.p  pCan anyone take a look at my code and see where I might be having an error which is causing thisp  pThanksp  precodeinclude ltsyswait.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltiostreamgt  define MAXPARANUM 5 define MAXCOMMANDLEN 1024  using namespace std  int mainint argc, char argv[]  char prgname1[MAXPARANUM], prgname2[MAXPARANUM] char command[MAXCOMMANDLEN] int pfd[2] pipepfd pidt cid1, cid2  char full  argv[1] char str[MAXCOMMANDLEN] int i  0 int j  0 int k  0 int ind  0 while ind lt strlenfull      if full[ind]             strncpycommand, str, i         cout ltlt command ltlt endl         prgname1[j]  command         j         i  0         ind          else          str[i]  full[ind]         i         ind           iffull[ind]            i  0         j  0         ind2         while ind lt strlenfull              if full[ind]                     strncpycommand, str, i                 cout ltlt command ltlt endl                 prgname2[j]  command                 j                 i  0                 ind                          else                  str[i]  full[ind]                 i                 ind                          if ind  strlenfull                  strncpycommand, str, i                 cout ltlt command ltlt endl                 prgname2[j]  command                 break                                   test output here not working correctly cout ltlt prgname1[0] ltlt endl cout ltlt prgname2[0] ltlt endl   exits if no parameters passed if argc  2      cout ltlt Usage ltlt argv[0] ltlt endl     exitEXITFAILURE    exits if there is a pipe error if pipepfd  1      cerr ltlt pipe ltlt endl     exitEXITFAILURE  cid1  fork   creates child process 1   exits if there is a fork error if cid1  1  cid2  1      cerr ltlt fork     exitEXITFAILURE   1st child process executes and writes to the pipe if cid1  0      char p  prgname1     close1    closes stdout     duppfd[1]     connects pipe output to stdout     closepfd[0]   closes pipe input as it is not needed     closepfd[1]   closes pipe output as pipe is connected           execvpprgname1[0], p     cerr ltlt execlp 1 failed ltlt endl     cid2  fork   2nd child process reads from the pipe and executes else if cid2  0      char p  prgname2     close0    closes stdin     duppfd[0]     connects pipe input to stdin     closepfd[0]   closes pipe input as pipe is connected     closepfd[1]   closes pipe output as it is not needed     execvpprgname2[0], p     cerr ltlt execlp 2 failed ltlt endl  else      sleep1     waitpidcid1, NULL, 0     waitpidcid2, NULL, 0     cout ltlt Program successfully completed ltlt endl     exitEXITSUCCESS  return 0 codepre  pp
Negative 12280 pI am having a problem over here. I am using SKSpriteNode for creating different objects in world. And I have applied gravity self i.e. SkScene. p  pSo, the problem here is when I create a SKSPriteNode and give mass to its physics body then it behaves similar for everytime. For examplep  pIf I put mass as 0 then also its falls down it should not because mass is zero, so according to physics rule body should not fall down with mass 0.p  pNow, if I change mass to 10 or 100 or even 1000 it falls down with the same speed as it is with 0 mass.p  pIs there any one with same issue Or can anyone help me with thisp

Negative 12280 pIm just learning about connection pools, and I was wondering if theres ever any reason to set codemaxIdlecode  codemaxActivecode.p  pThis is my understandingp  pIdle connections are connections that have been created and are waiting to be used. It becomes an active connection once a client borrows it.p  pcodeminIdlecode determines the number of initial connections to create in a pool. p  pWhen a client tries to use the pool, an idle connection is given. If there are no available idle connections, the pool will create one. When an idle connection becomes an active connection, if the number of idle connections fall below codeminIdlecode, the pool will create connections until there are at least codeminIdlecode idle connections. When a client is finished with an active connection, the connection becomes an idle connection again.p  pThis means the number of idle connections can grow, so codemaxIdlecode prevents the connection pool from having too many idle connections. Since codemaxActivecode caps the number of connections that can be borrowed, there is no need to have a codemaxIdlecode  codemaxActivecode.p

Negative 12280 pI am very new to HTML and SQL so everything I am doing is self taught through this and other online sites.   I create a number of forms based on the number of entries in my database.  This number can vary up approximately 50 entries.  Essentially, what I want to do is create a submit button that posts three pieces of information to a second database.  These pieces of information are the part number always a unique value, the cure time, and the press number.  I know part of my problem is giving values unique names so the submit knows what data it is to be using, but I cannot seem to figure out the proper format.  For the time being, I only want to pass the partnum variable to the second database.  I can reverse engineer backward from there to get the rest. brbrPHP codep  precodefunction presslistpartnum      echo ltselect namePressused.partnum.stylefloatrightgt     echo ltoption selectedgtltoptiongt     echo ltoption value A1TgtA1Tltoptiongt     ... lt other options omitted to save space     echo ltoption value A10BgtA10Bltoptiongt     echo ltselectgt  function loadbuttoncureleft     if cureleft lt 0            echo ltinput typesubmit valueLoading gt        else            echo ltinput typesubmit valueLoading disabledgt       whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult     partnum  row[PartNumber]    echo ltform actionloadpost.php name.row[PartNumber].gt    echo ltfieldsetgt    echo lth3gt.row[PartNumber].lth3gt    echo ltinput typehidden name.partnum. value.partnum.gt    echo ltp classcentergt.row[New].ltpgt    echo ltp classcentergtSize ltbgt.row[TireSize].ltbgtltpgt       echo ltp classleftaligngtTread     echo row[TypeampTread]    weightnumberformatrow[BuildWeight],1    echo ltspan classrightaligngtWeight .weight.ltspangtltpgt    echo ltp classboxgtNotes    echo ltbrgtltspan classcentergt.row[NOTES].ltspangtltpgt    echo ltp classleftaligngtScheduled Press     echo row[Press]    presslistpartnum    echo ltpgt    echo ltp classleftaligngtCure time     echo row[CureTime]60    cureleft  row[CureTime]60190    echo ltspan classrightaligngtCure left .cureleft.ltspangtltpgt    loadbuttoncureleft    echo ltfieldsetgt    echo ltformgt       mysqliclosecon codepre  pp  pLoadpost.phpp  precodeltphp     conmysqliconnectlocalhost,root,admin,floortracking  Check connection if mysqliconnecterrno       echo Failed to connect to MySQL  . mysqliconnecterror       sqlINSERT INTO loaded Cure, Time, Tire, Press VALUES 53,now,POST[partnum],POST[Pressused]  if mysqliquerycon,sql      dieError  . mysqlierrorcon    echo ltpgt1 record addedltpgt mysqliclosecon gt codepre  pOne form HTMLp  precodeltform actionloadpost.php name01590905001Rgtltfieldsetgtlth3gt01590905001Rlth3gtltinput typehidden namepartnum value01590905001Rgtltp classcentergt20005133ltpgtltp classcentergtSize ltbgtRECLAIMltbgtltpgtltp classleftaligngtTread BO2Kltspan classrightaligngtWeight 56.0ltspangtltpgtltp classboxgtNotesltbrgtltspan classcentergtRECLAIMltspangtltpgtltp classleftaligngtScheduled Press A1Tltselect namePressused stylefloatrightgtltoption selectedgtltoptiongtltoption value A1TgtA1Tltoptiongtltoption value A1MgtA1Mltoptiongtltoption value A1BgtA1Bltoptiongtltoption value A2TgtA2Tltoptiongtltoption value A2BgtA2Bltoptiongtltoption value A3TgtA3Tltoptiongtltoption value A3MgtA3Mltoptiongtltoption value A3BgtA3Bltoptiongtltoption value A4TgtA4Tltoptiongtltoption value A4BgtA4Bltoptiongtltoption value A5TgtA2Tltoptiongtltoption value A5BgtA2Bltoptiongtltoption value A6gtA6ltoptiongtltoption value A7TgtA7Tltoptiongtltoption value A7BgtA7Bltoptiongtltoption value A8TgtA8Tltoptiongtltoption value A8BgtA8Bltoptiongtltoption value A9TgtA9Tltoptiongtltoption value A9BgtA9Bltoptiongtltoption value A10TgtA10Tltoptiongtltoption value A10BgtA10Bltoptiongtltselectgtltpgtltp classleftaligngtCure time 180ltspan classrightaligngtCure left 10ltspangtltpgtltinput typesubmit valueLoading gtltfieldsetgtltformgt codepre

Negative 12280 pI have an application strongopenCV  Cstrong  that grab an image from webcam, encode it in JPG and trasmitt it from a Server to Client. Thwebcam is stereo so actually I have two image, LEFT and RIGHT. In the client, when I recieve the image I decode it and I generate an Anaglyph 3D Effect. For do this I use the OpenCV... Well I encode the image in this wayp  precode params.pushbackCVIMWRITEJPEGQUALITY  params.pushback60 image quality  imshowimage  here the anagliphic image is good  cvimencode.jpg, image, buffer, params codepre  pand decode in this wayp  precode cvMat imageRecieved  cvimdecode cvMatv, CVLOADIMAGECOLOR  codepre  pWhat I see is that this kind of encode generate in the Anaglyph image a ghost effect artifact so there is a bad effect with the edges of the object. If look a door for example there a ghost effect with the edge of the door. Im sure that this depends of the encode because if I show the Anaglyph  image before encode instruction this work well. I cannot use the PNG because it generate to large image and this is a problem for the connection between the Server and the Client.p  pI look for the GIF but, if I understood good, is nt supported by the cvencode function.p  pSo there is another way to encode a cvMat obj in JPG withou this bad effect and without increase to much the size of the imagep

Negative 12280 pI want to provide some functionality for compiling sources of a specific kind e.g. java. As the process of compilation needs additional information i need to give in some more arguments and not only the sourcefile. E.g. working directory, compiler parameters and so on.p  pThere are two ways in my mind how to design itp  ol lipUsing OOP, that means creating a compiler class, saving the additional arguments when constructing a specific compiler object that can then be used for compiling by just providing the sourcefilepli lipNot creating a class for creating objects but just a static final closure in a class and then using curry to pass in the needed arguments and returning another compile function which can then be provided by for example just the sourcefile to compile itpli ol  pWhat are the pros and cons Is there maybe an even better way to get things donep

Negative 12280 pI have an app delivered via Java Web Start that is signed with an official certificate provided by Verisign, and also a selfsigned certificate that we have generated.  This is done because we restrict use of the official certificate for the build delivered to customers, but we need to have our test builds signed by a certificate to get the application loaded at all.p  pMy question is is it normal that Java 7b55 still shows security warnings for the selfsigned certificate, even though the official certificate is present  I would expect the official certificate to take precedence but it appears to be not the case.p  pJust wondering if anyone else has hit this or if its unique to my environment..p

Companies is the parent main form and subsidiaries is the children subform.p  pI need to have the subform display ONLY the records where the region field in the subform matches the region field corresponding to the user who just logged in through the log in box.p  pI am fairly new to Access and if someone could provide some guidance, that would be truly appreciated.p  pBest, Bernardo p

Bank codes, etc. usually have some checksum that you need to compute.

But this comes and bites me back, because, by using a variadictemplated codegetinstancecode function and passing the instance parameters via codestdforwardcode, the compiler generates an overload for each call with different types, and therefore returns a new static instance for each overload. What I would like is to return by reference a single instance common somehow to all possible overloads, but cannot figure out how to do it. Any ideas how to do it Thanksp  pPS I can implement a solution with pointers instead of references, but I prefer the reference solution as it is thread safe and more elegant in my opinion.p

Negative 12280 pI really would like to make Tkinter text widget newline characters visible when running under Python 3.4. It would be great if they appeared as a traditional Pilcrow ASCII 20 character. If not, I suppose I could bind  to both the newline and Pilcrow character. Or globally search and replace newlines and replace them with a newline and a Pilcrow when the text file loads or changes, but then editing lines becomes a bit problematic. One might delete a Pilcrow but not the invisible newline character next to it, making things confusing. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 12280 pI need to build a Python application that receives highly secure data, decrypts it, and processes amp stores in a database. My server may be anywhere in the world so direct connection is not feasible. What is the safestsmartest way to securely transmit data from one server to another think governmentbanklevel security. I know this is quite vague but part of the reason for that is to not limit the scope of answers received.p  pBasically, if you were building an app between two banks this has nothing to do with banks but just for reference, how would you securely transmit the data p  pSorry, I should also add SFTP probably will not cut it since this python app must fire when it is pinged from the other server with a secure data transmission.p

Negative 12280 pI am currently developping for a client a wordpress CMS which will act as webservices for a windows phone application. In this CMS, I will use ImageMagick for PHP to convert a multipage PDF to a single image. This image will then be sent to windows phone application. The PDF will almost never changed and it is to make the operation transparent for admin of CMS. I want, when they change the PDF which will be perhaps extremly rare, to make make it invisible for them.p  pMy question is this  can we use GhostScript which will be used by ImageMagick without a commercial licence p  pI contacted Artifex but they werent very helpful with their answers. They oriented me to another of theirs software. They didnt answer at all my questions.p  pThanksp  pTristanp

Negative 12280 pI am trying to make a recursive tree such that codeparentcode has reference to codechildcode and codechildcode has reference to codeparentcode. The thing I am trying to do is to backtrace the tree from a codechildcode whitout mutable members. It is hard because giving the child a reference to the codeparentcode in the constructor requireds the codeparentcode instance to be already created.p  pI only could think of two ways and both are not so good. The first way is the fallowingp  ol licreate child instance with function setParent which only works once with the help of a private boolean variable.li licreate parent and pass the child instance.li lithe parent will pass itself to setParent.li ol  pAfter that, child has reference to parent and setParent cannot be used.p  pThe second way is to create codeparentcode and codechildcode completly separate but hold them in some sort of data structure which can search for codeparentcode of some child and the otherway arround.p  pIf there is a better way please teach me. I work mainly in java but the question is general.p

Negative 12280 pIm a bit confused with Apple documentation relating to the explanation of whether to use prefix for methods or not  p  pcodeApple Doc Explanation 1codep  pUse prefixes when naming classes, protocols, functions, constants, and typedef structures. Do not use prefixes when naming methods methods exist in a name space created by the class that defines them. Also, dont use prefixes for naming the fields of a structurep  pcodeApple Doc Explanation 2codep  pIf you are subclassing a large Cocoa framework class such as codeNSViewcode or codeUIViewcode and you want to be absolutely sure that your private methods have names different from those in the superclass, you can add your own prefix to your private methods. The prefix should be as unique as possible, perhaps one based on your company or project and of the form codeXXcode. So if your project is called Byte Flogger, the prefix might be codeBFaddObjectcodep

Negative 12280 pHave a SharePoint remote web application that will be managing data for multiple tenant databases and thus, ultimately, multiple tenant database connections. In essence, each operation will deal with 2 databases. p  pThe first is our tenancy database, where we store information that is specific for each tenant. This can be the SharePoint OAuth Client ID and secret, as well as information about how to connect to the tenants specific database, which is the second database. This means that connecting to the first database will be required before we can connect to the second database.p  pI believe I know how to do this using SimpleInjector for HTTP requests. I could register the first connection type whether that be an IDbConnection wrapper using ADO.NET or a TenancyDbContext from entity framework with per web request lifetime.p  pI could then register an abstract factory to resolve the connections to the tenantspecific databases. This factory would depend on the first database type, as well as the SimpleInjector Container. Queries amp commands that need to access the tenant database will depend on this abstract factory and use it to obtain the connection to the tenant database by passing an argument to a factory method.p  pMy question mainly has to do with how to handle this in the context of an operation that may or may not have a nonnull codeHttpContext.Currentcode. When a SharePoint app is installed, we are sometimes running a WCF code.svccode service to perform certain operations. When SharePoint invokes this, sometimes codeHttpContextcode is null. I need a solution that will work in both cases, for both database connections, and that will make sure the connections are disposed when they are no longer needed.p  pI have some older example code that uses the LifetimeScope, but I see now that there is an Execution Context Scoping package available for SimpleInjector on nuget. I am wondering if I should use that to create hybrid scoping for these 2 database connections with  without HTTP context, and if so, how is it different from lifetime scoping using codeContainer.GetCurrentLifetimeScopecode and codeContainer.BeginLifetmeScopecodep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI read up on the execution scope lifestyle, and ended up with the following 3way hybridp  precodevar hybridDataAccessLifestyle  Lifestyle.CreateHybrid  create a hybrid lifestyle     lifestyleSelector  gt HttpContext.Current  null,  when the object is needed by a web request     trueLifestyle new WebRequestLifestyle,  create one instance for all code invoked by the web request     falseLifestyle Lifestyle.CreateHybrid  otherwise, create another hybrid lifestyle         lifestyleSelector  gt OperationContext.Current  null,   when the object is needed by a WCF op,         trueLifestyle new WcfOperationLifestyle,  create one instance for all code invoked by the op         falseLifestyle new ExecutionContextScopeLifestyle  in all other cases, create per execution scope  codepre  pHowever my question really has to do with how to create a dependency which will get its connection string sometime after the root is already composed. Here is some pseudo code I came up with that implements an idea I have for how to implement thisp  precodepublic class DatabaseConnectionContainerImpl  IDatabaseConnectionContainer, IDisposable      private readonly AllTenantsDbContext allTenantsDbContext     private TenantSpecificDbContext tenantSpecificDbContext     private Uri tenantUri  null      public DatabaseConnectionContainerImplAllTenantsDbContext allTenantsDbContext              allTenantsDbContext  allTenantsDbContext           public TenantSpecificDbContext GetInstanceUri tenantUri              if tenantUri  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptiontenantUri         if tenantUri  null ampamp tenantUri.Authority  tenantUri.Authority             throw new InvalidOperationException                 You can only connect to one tenant database within this scope.          if tenantSpecificDbContext  null              var tenancy  allTenantsDbContext.SetltTenancygt                 .SingleOrDefaultx gt x.Authority  tenantUri.Authority             if tenancy  null                 throw new InvalidOperationExceptionstring.Format                     Tenant with URI Authority 0 does not exist., tenantUri.Authority              tenantSpecificDbContext  new TenantSpecificDbContexttenancy.ConnectionString            tenantUri  tenantUri                  return tenantSpecificDbContext           void IDisposable.Dispose              if tenantSpecificDbContext  null tenantSpecificDbContext.Dispose       codepre  pThe bottom line is that there is a runtime codeUricode variable that will be used to determine what the connection string will be to the codeTenantSpecificDbContextcode instance. This Uri variable is passed into all WCF operations and HTTP web requests. Since this variable is not known until runtime after the root is composed, I dont think there is any way to inject it into the constructor. p  pAny better ideas than the one above, or will the one above be problematicp

Negative 12280 pI want to implement codeUIAPPEARANCESELECTORcode on my codeUIViewcode which contains other subviews that implement codeUIAPPEARANCESELECTORcode for instance codeUILabelcode,codeUIBarButtoncode etc.p  pFor instance if my view isp  precodeinterface MyView  UIView  property nonatomic,strong UILabel topLabel UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR property nonatomic,strong UILabel middleLabel UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR property nonatomic,strong UILabel bottomLabel UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR end  interface UILabel FontAppearance property nonatomic, copy UIFont appearanceFont UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR property nonatomic, copy UIColor appearanceTextColor UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR end   helper for UILabel appearance implementation UILabel FontAppearance  voidsetAppearanceFontUIFontfont      [self setFontfont]   UIFontappearanceFont      return [self font]   voidsetAppearanceTextColorUIColor appearanceTextColor      self.textColor  appearanceTextColor   UIColor appearanceTextColor      return [self textColor]  end codepre  pI would like to set each labels appearance separately p  precode[[[MyView appearance] topLabel] setAppearanceTextColor[UIColor blackColor]] [[[MyView appearance] middleLabel] setAppearanceTextColor[UIColor redColor]] [[[MyView appearance] bottomLabel] setAppearanceTextColor[UIColor yellowColor]] codepre  pThis doesnt work , I think the mechanism forces me to create stubs for each property to set. This is very annoying and a lot of boilerplate , as it could happen that each subview itself exposes multiple appearance selectors, and I am forced to create a codeUIAPPEARANCESELECTORcode for each property multiple times.p  pFor instance in this case, in order to solve the problem, I needed to add synthetic propertiesp  precodeinterface MyView  UIView  property nonatomic,strong UILabel topLabel UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR doesnt work... property nonatomic,strong UILabel middleLabel UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR property nonatomic,strong UILabel bottomLabel UIAPPEARANCESELECTOR   fix...

Negative 12280 pI am trying to prepare for technical interviews and I noticed a few practice questions involved bit masking and bit shifting. I am unfamiliar with these concepts. I understand that if you are using half of a byte and want to leave the other half available you can mask the 4 bits you want to use, but I am still fairly confused about how this might be easily understood or applied to a coding problem. If someone has sufficient knowledge or some resource that explains this in very simple terms preferably in Java I would greatly appreciate it. Thanksp

Negative 12280 pIm trying to understand the difference between why you can do an OPENcall in fortran on NFSv3 in readwrite mode on a file that you only have readpermissions on, while if you do the same thing on NFSv4 the OPENcall will fail. p  pLet me explain, below is a simple fortranprogram that opens given file argument to the program in readwrite mode, p  precodePROGRAM testopen   IMPLICIT NONE    Parameters   INTEGER,            PARAMETER  lunin  10  CHARACTERLEN100  fname    Local   INTEGER  i,ierr,siteid,nstation  REAL  lat, lon, asl  CHARACTERlen15  name        Open input file     CALL getarg1,fname   OPENlunin,filefname,STATUSOLD,IOSTATierr   IF  ierr  0  THEN     WRITE6,Could not open ,TRIMfname,ierr     STOP  ENDIF   WRITE6,Opened OK   CLOSElunin   END PROGRAM testopen codepre  pSave the above in testopen.f90 and compile with, p  precodegfortran o fortran testopen.f90  codepre  pNow, execute the following on a mountpoint with NFSv3, p  precodestrace eopen .fortran filewithonlyreadpermissions  codepre  pAnd you should see the following lines along with a lot of other output, p  precodegt openfilewithonlyreadpermissions, ORDWR   1 EACCES Permission denied gt openfilewithonlyreadpermissions, ORDONLY  3 codepre  pSo, we can clearly see that we get an EACCES Permission denied while trying to open in ORDWR open readwrite, embutem right after we see another open ORDONLY open readonly and that succeeds. p  pRun the same program on a file on a NFSv4 share, and we get the following, p  precodestrace eopen .fortran filewithonlyreadpermissionsonnfsv4share  gt openfilewithonlyreadpermissionsonnfsv4share, ORDWR   1 EPERM Operation not permitted  codepre  pSo, here we get an EPERM Operation not permitted while trying to open the file in ORDWR open readwrite and nothing more ie application fails. p  pDoing the same tests in C with a small testprogram it will fail to open the file in both scenarios that is, it will not try to open the file in readonlymode after getting the EACCES on NFSv3. p  pSo to the questions, p  ul lipI assume the above behaviour is due to the implementation of the OPENcall in fortran, and that if fortran gets an EACCES Permission denied while trying to open a file, it will automatically try to open the file in readonly ORDONLY. Is this assumption correct  pli lipI also assume that fortran doesnt have this fallbackmethod when getting an EPERM Operation not permitted while trying to open a file. Is this assumption correct, or am I missing something  pli lipC doesnt seem to implement a fallbackmethod in either a EACCES nor EPERM. This seems correct to me, since this doesnt leave any room for confusion. If you try to open a file in a way that you do not have the permissions to do, the program should fail  my opinion.  pli lipI am aware of that there is a distinct difference between Permission denied and Operation not permitted. And I guess that when mounting NFSv4 over kerberos there is a reason for getting Permission denied instead of Operation not permitted, however some clarification regarding this area would be great. pli ul  pOf course, adding the appropriate flags to the opencall ACTIONREAD solves the problem. Im just curios about my assumptions and if they are correct.p

Negative 12280 pUsing Unity 5.0. Working on Android.p  pI simply have a Canvas  with inside a Panel  with inside a Button. p  pThe Button has in its Button script the OnClick with a GameObject linked.  The GameObject has a script with a function.p  pWhen I tap the button I simply trigger the function, which is working properly on Unity.p  pBut when I deploy the project on an Android 4.4.2 device, it works only if you tap and leave the finger very fast. Otherwise if you tap and wait just a second, when you remove the finger the OnClick is not called anymore. p  pSeems like it is triggering a sort of long tap and it is ignoring my normal tap. I am missing some seetings I have not much code at all, just the function, the rest is all done via Unity inspector.p

Negative 12280 pI have a main class GreenhouseControls which basically is a control system that handles various Events such as Powerout, FansOn, LightOff, ThermostatNight etc.  each of these are seperate event classes that extend a basic Event which has a delaytime and an eventTime to display all events with time interval. GreenhouseControls has various state variables that indicate the state of an event, for example for FansOff event, fans variable will be false. In my previous assignment all event classes were inner classes of GreenhouseControls and each class was setting the corresponding state varialbe.br For this assignment, I was required to make each class a separate class extends Event and Event implements Runnable, so each event will be a thread.br After we are asked to remove all state variables and replace them by a collection of TwoTuple.....the exact requirement follows Remove all existing states variables in GreenhouseControls and replace them by using a collection of TwoTuple. Each time an event runs it should add an entry that identifies the variable the event is modifying as key, and another object to this structure as the value the event is setting. Create a method in GreenhouseControls called setVariable to handle updating to this collection. Use the synchronization feature in java to ensure that two Event classes are not trying to add to the structure at the same time. Again make whatever changes are required to the overall design. Provide adequate methods to access the state variables.p  pI did the following for thisp  pfirst, I created a basic TwoTuple classp  precodepublic class TwoTupleltA, Bgt      public final A variable     public final B value     public TwoTupleA a, B bvariable  a value  b  codepre  pNext, in GreenhouseControls I have a collection and a setVariable methodp  precodepublic ArrayListltTwoTupleltString,Objectgtgt variables  new     ArrayListltTwoTupleltString,Objectgtgt  public synchronized void setVariableString variable, Object value variables.addnew TwoTupleltString,Objectgtvariable,value  codepre  pThen, in the run method for each event I call the setVariable method with a string which is the name of the variable as key and a value for that key, for example LightOff.run has the following statementp  precodegcEvent.setVariableLight, false   gcEvent is a GreenhouseControls object created in the Event  class to access various members of GreenhouseControls. codepre  pNow I am really confused about where the variables should be placed because the assignment requirement says remove all state variable.....before i had private boolean light  false      all class variables initialized to an off statep  precodeprivate boolean water  false private boolean fans  false private String thermostat  Day private boolean windowok  false private boolean poweron  false codepre  pnow if I remove them then where should they be and how will they be set I have no clue what to do here.........can someone please take some time and help me......any comments, suggestions, answers will b greatly appreciated, I am in need for help.......PLEASE if you understand the question or know what they are asking, please reply.....Thanksp

Negative 12280 pI have wondered about this for a while now, all codeUserStorecode methods return a codeTaskcode or a typed codeTaskltTgtcode, but why do they Why not just return T I understand that they are Aync methods and are part of OWIN middleware, does that have something to do with itp  pI also notice that some methods that return a plain old codeTaskcode actually return an empty codeTaskcode.

Negative 12280 pIn strongPostgreSQLstrong I have a table emoneem, and another table emtwoem. In both there is some emidem column, and there exists a foreign key on emone.idem referencing emtwo.idem. What I want to do is drop the table emtwoem in such a way, that all rows in emoneem have their ids set to null.p  pThe problem is I dont want to modify the content of the table itself, only the stucture. I thought of setting the mentioned foreign key to be set null on delete, then delete all rows from emtwoem, and finally drop emtwoem cascade, but the issue is, I dont know the constraints name, so it would require using some advanced manipulation to get it out, which Id like to avoid. strongI have no direct access to the database, all I can do is execute a query on it.

Negative 12280 pIn the project where Im working, we are distributing large files various GB using Amazon CloudFront. As the files are private, when a user requests one download, we generate a signed url valid for a certain period of time.p  pThen, the question is that we would like to know, given one of the urls, the progress of the download. I think that using the CloudFront logs we will be able to know at which time the link has been used, and if it is the case, we can assume that the download has started, but do you know if there is some way to know the progress of the downloadp  pThanksp

What Im looking for is a way for users to not be able to press anything for a very short period after pressing back or make it so after I displayView0 users can ONLY press whats in the default fragment, and not be able to press anything in the other fragments right before it switches.p

In this class, Im creating a list of codeILoaderscode that the class will iterate and load, so that in the future if I use something else than the JSON, the abstraction will already be implemented.p  precodepublic class DataLoader      private ListltIDataLoadedgt allDataLoaded  new ListltIDataLoadedgt      private ListltILoadergt loaderLists  new ListltILoadergt          new JSONLoaderltRootSpacecraftsgt,         new JSONLoaderltRootWeaponsgt           public void LoadData         foreachILoader loader in loaderLists             loader.Read              IDataLoaded dataLoaded  loader.Load              allDataLoaded.AdddataLoaded                codepre  pWhen I created my codeJSONLoadercode class and made it implement the codeILoadercode interface, I noticed that I had to transform codeILoadercode into a generic interface I will always need to provide the root class codeTcode that the codeJSONLoadercode will put the data into, and also needed it to be flexible and return a codeListltTgtcode containing the data loaded.p  pSo now my codeJSONLoadercode class reads asp  precodepublic class JSONLoaderltTgt  ILoaderltTgt where T  IDataLoaded, new      private string fileContents     private T output  new T     private ListltTgt outputlist      public void Read         fileContents  File.ReadAllTextPaths.Getoutput.Descriptor         outputlist   JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltListltTgtgtfileContents           public ListltTgt Load         return outputlist          codepre  pAnd the ILoaderp  precodepublic interface ILoaderltTgt     void Read     ListltTgt Load  codepre  pNow when I went back to the codeDataLoadercode class, as you can see, I lost the flexibility to call the codeILoadercode, because I will need to tell what is the generic class being used.p  pI tried to encapsulate it in another interface, but then the codeloader.Loadcode call in the codeDataLoadercode was broken, since it returns a codeListltTgtcode.p  pRight now Im feeling that to fix in one side, I will break the other. Ive been trying to think a good combination of abstract classes and interfaces to isolate everything accordingly, but Im having a big trouble in visualizing how it would all fit Im fairly new to C and dont yet have the mental agility in it to see what I should do and encapsulate.p  pIm using this as an exercise to learn C and was hoping to use the best programming practices possible. Id like to have a robust code, without duplication and with the minimum amount of dependencies between classes. I was also hoping in getting an explanation and not simply a working code. Thank youp

Negative 12280 pI have a 3D point cloud that I attained from tracing out the outline of a shape with sensors attached to my fingertips.

Negative 12280 pIm struggling finding out a way to upload video files to GCS from my GCE. I think a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocspythongooglecloudstorageclientgetstarted relnofollowthis doca is the most relevant one but the example is supposed to be run on GAE, which has a much more straightforward authentication process, not GCE. My question is how to authenticate GCE to access GCS and upload objects with Python client APIs. I have no problem doing so with codegsutilcode, but I want to use Python APIs directly. The docs from Google are very fragmented and kinda confusing for me. Thanks a lot.p

Negative 12280 pRecently I am trying to find out best Docker logging mechanism using ELK stack. I am having some questions regarding the best work flow that companies use in production. Our system has typical software stack including Tomcat, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Nginx, RabbitMQ, Couchbase etc. As of now, our stack runs in CoreOS cluster. Please find my questions belowp  ol liWith ELK stack, what is the best methodology to do the log forwarding  Should I use Lumberjack . I am asking this because I have seen workflows where people use SyslogRsyslog to forward the logs to logstash.li liSince all of our software pieces are containerized, should I include Logforwarder in all my containers  I am planning to do this as most of my containers switch nodes based on health so I am not keen on mounting the file system from the container to host.li liShould I use redis as a broker in forwarding the logs  If yes why li liHow difficult is it to write logconfig files that defines the log format to be forwarded to logstash li ol  pThis is a subjective questions but I am sure that this is a problem that people have solved long ago and I am not keen on reinventing the wheel.p

Negative 12280 pI am wondering how I might go about using the codeReactiveCocoacode library to codeRACcodeify codeUIApplicationDelegatecode lifecycle events.p  pSince the most important one is code BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptionscode, that seems like a logical place to start to me.p  pThe basic idea, if I understand correctly, would be to create a codeRACSignalcode that would encapsulate the event application finished launching with these options, send it either serially through a pipeline or in parallel to multiple application start handlers and then merge all of their outputs  if serially, then only continue when each returns codeYEScode, if parallel, codeif handler1  YES ampamp handler2  YES ...code  and then codereturncode the combined response in the actual codeUIApplicationDelegatecode.p  pHowever, I am fuzzy on the precise details of how this would be accomplished  which is probably evident from my line of questioning.p  pAny examples, either in real code or just pseudocode, would be greatly appreciated. It would for me and probably others serve a dual purpose 1 the stated one, and 2 provide an example of how to codeRACcodeify a nonUIdriven event well, thats not even exactly true, but I think you see what I mean.p

Negative 12280 pI was looking doing a code review today whereby someone one attempting to dispose of a codeMemoryStreamcode by wrapping it up in a codeusingcode block. In this case it was being passed into a codeSqlXmlcode instance, and I wasnt sure what it did with it, so I took a quick look at the decompiled source. Heres the example codep  precodeusingMemoryStream ms  new MemoryStreamdata     var param  new SqlXmlms    var parameter  new SqlParameterXml, System.Data.SqlDbType.Xml  Value  param     command.Parameters.Addparameter   return command codepre  pHere is the decompiled sourcep  precodepublic SqlXmlStream value      if value  null              this.SetNull          else              this.firstCreateReader  true         this.mfNotNull  true         this.mstream  value       codepre  pNow best practice says that the codeSqlXmlcode should now take responsibility for disposing of this stream. But unfortunately it doesnt implement codeIDisposablecode. p  pOn top of this I dont know when the codeSqlCommandcode containing it is going to get consumed and codeSqlXmlcode is sealed, so I can realistically extend it. p  pCan anyone suggest a good approach for handling this Im planning on logging a bug somewhere with Microsoft because its not a very nice thing to have to workaround. p  pMy best suggestion at the moment is to use the constructor that takes an codeXmlReadercode because it at least copies the contents, so the reader can then be disposed  however internally that just creates a codeMemoryStreamcode and never cleans it up either.p

Negative 12280 pThe codeulcode tag is very generic and something I continually struggle with.p  pInitially I had a base style rule defined for my codeulcode and codelicode tags to handle bullet points in my generic text blocks for WYSIWYG text. I am using BEM so I figured I would just add a class to any codeulcode which had a different role emsay a menu, or a list of news thumbnails, etc.emp  pThe problem is that I dont always have control over the markup my current problem is a pagination plugin which uses a codeullicode structure but doesnt allow me add a class to the codeulcode.p  pI am using BEM so I dont really want to use descendant selectors, and especially element selectors, but I realise I will probably need to do so when I dont have access to the codeullicode markup.p  pAny advice would be appreciated  especially with baserest rules, as I have codeullicode lists all over the place in so many sites and once and for all want to master this problem.p  pThanksp

Negative 12280 pI upgraded my project from a WatchKit app to a watchOS 2 app. Everything is working fine, it runs on watchOS 2 on an upgraded Apple Watch. Uploading to TestFlight also works, no complains from Apple.p  pWhen I install it from TestFlight, the iPhone app also works fine, but when I click the Install on Apple Watch button in Testflight, it goes to the right for a few seconds, then immediately to the left again without any error message. Not even in the device logs.p  pBut what I also saw is, that when I install the app in general via TestFlight, the watchOS 2 app gets install on the watch I assume, because I enabled the Automatic App Install option and then the watch app works fine. So there doesnt seem to be something wrong with the app itself. But then again, TestFlight shows it as uninstalled and when I uninstall it via the Watch app on the iPhone, I cant install it again in TestFlight.p  pAnyone has any idea what Im doing wrongp

Negative 12280 pIm on a dev team working on a large scale project that uses Springbased microservices.  Weve recently discovered the Spring Cloud project and are experimenting with implementing the Netflix services, Zuul, Eureka, Ribbon, etc.p  pIn our environment, nobody will have access to the domain that our application will be running on until they have be preauthorized through an external service.  Once they reach our application, we will be able to obtain the users identity through a header token provided by the authorization service.p  pId like to have Zuul set up with Spring Security using a preauthentication filter to establish the users session, and use Spring Session to make the session available to all backend microservices.p  pIs this a legitimate approach  The only information I can see about security on Zuul is the ability to proxy OAuth2 tokens to backend services, but we have no need for OAuth2.  Is there a better way to establish the users session and share it across the services in our backend architecturep

Negative 12280 pIm building an angular app and im trying to understand better about promises When im dealying with async calls like http what i usually do is wrap them in a service then call them in my controllers like thisp  precode...  function whateverarguments      dataService.getUserarguments         .thenonUserComplete         .thendataService.getExtra         .thenonExtraComplete         .catchonError      function onUserCompleteuser          do something with user         ...          return user id because we are          supposing that getExtra is          requiring an id as argument         return user.id           function onExtraCompleteextra           do something with extra          no need to return anything,          we are the last element of the          chain.           function onErrorerror          console.logerror        ... codepre  pThis help me keeping every function understandable and maintenable, easy to read and consistent... at least until i need to deal with collection. Suppose that i need to do the same thing as before, but instead of having one user, im getting the entire collection of user and i still need to obtain the extra data of each single user. What i did is thisp  precode...  function whateverarguments      dataService.getUsersarguments         .thenonUsersComplete         .catchonError      function onUsersCompleteusers          users.forEachfunctionuser              dataService.getExtrauser.id                 .thenonExtraComplete                 .catchonError                    ...   ... codepre  pIs this the best that i can obtain trying to follow my coding style  Is even possible to resolve my problem with a single promise chain Thanksp
