Positive 729 pIve got a legacy database that was created with the database type INTEGER for many 1.000 Oracle columns. A database with the same structure exists for MS SQL. As I was told, the original definition was created using a tool that generated the scripts from a logical model to the specific one for MS SQL and Oracle.p  pUsing C and MFC the columns were mapped nicely to the integer type for both DBMs.p  pI am porting this application to .NET and C. The same C codebase is used to access both MS SQL and Oracle. We use the same DataSets and logic and we need the same types int32 for both.p  pThe ODP.NET driver from Oracle maps them to Decimal. This is logical as Oracle created the integer columns as NUMBER37 automatically. The columns in MS SQL map to int32.p  pCan I somehow control how to map the types in the ODP.NET driver I would like to say something like map NUMBER37 to int32. The columns will never hold values bigger than the limits of an int32. We know this because it is being used in the MS SQL version.p  pAlternatively, can I modify all columns from NUMBER37 to NUMBER8 or SIMPLEINTEGER so that they map to the right type for us Many of these columns are used as primary keys think autoincrement.p
Positive 729 pI have an application with a huge DataTable as in large number of columns that is receiving high frequency updates and is currently running too slowly. My profiling shows a disproportionate amount of time is being spent on the BeginEdit and EndEdit calls on the DataRows.

Positive 729 pI am working on a file parervalidator application that needs to pull in records from various flat filesCSV, Fixed Width, etc, validate the data in the columns and eventually present the data to the calling application in a DataTable for processing. In this I need to make a decision on a tradeoff between memory usage and speed. Heres the dilemma. I cant build the DataTable with the appropriate column types until I know that all of the data is correct. I cant very well stick the value one into a column of type Int or Decimal. So I need to loop through the file processing each field on each record determining if it of the correct type and within the appropriate range. If there is a error I need to write that to an errors column in the Table and then it will eventually be presented to the user for correction. If the error is one that precludes me from putting the data value into its column e.g. text into a numeric column then I have an issue. What Ive determined is that I need a DataTable that has all stringtext columns plus one extra to report the errors for the record. If there are no errors then I need to go back through the data putting it into a DataTable where the columns are the appropriate type and returning it back to the calling application indicating that it passed the validation. If not then I return the DataTable where all of the columns are text with the additional error column so it can present the data to the user to be corrected.p  pSo heres the question. p  ul liWould it be better to loop through the file twice Validating the data on the first pass and then building up the valid DataTable on the secondli liWould it be better to better to loop through the file once building up the all text display DataTable and then loop through that first DataTable on the second pass building up the valid DataTableli liWould it be better to build up both DataTables simultaneously as I make one pass through the file and then toss out the valid DataTable if I encounter an errorli ul  pThe first two approaches would use less memory but would take longer. And which of these two would take longer Looping through the file twice or looping through the file once and the resulting DataTable once The third option would be faster, because I am only looping through the data one time. Given that there could easily be several hundred thousand records in any given file, this could be significant. On the other hand, given that number of records, having two DataTables in memory would chew up a lot of additional memory. This being initially targeted to a web application that is not a desirable either.p  pAny thoughts andor suggestions on this would be truly appreciated.p  pThanks, Dougp  pIf you are going to down vote this as I see two people already have, please be respectful enough to add a comment as to why.p

Negative 729 pI have a Form in my application that displays some data. When I first show the Form, I load some data into a DataTable then bind the DataTable to a DataGridView. I also start an asynchronous method that executes some slower database queries. When these slow queries complete, I need to update a few hundred rows in the DataTable, filling in values returned from the slower queries, like sop  precodeforeach DataRow row in data.Rows      SlowLoadingData slowstuff  slowqueryresults[introw[id]]      row.BeginEdit     row[columnone]  slowstuff.One     row[columntwo]  slowstuff.Two     row[columnthree]  slowstuff.Three     row.EndEdit  codepre  pThis is extremely slow, hanging the UI thread for a minute or more, presumably because each row is triggering a redraw.p  pAfter some research, I found a way to make it fast. First, bind the DataGridView to a BindingSource that is bound to the DataTable, instead of directly to the DataTable. Then, do as follows when you make changes to the DataTablep  precodebindingsource.SuspendBinding bindingsource.RaiseListChangedEvents  false  foreach DataRow in Data.Rows ... code above bindingsource.RaiseListChangedEvents  true bindingsource.ResumeBinding grid.Refresh codepre  pThere is a problem, though, and its a doozy the code above prevents the DataGridView from detecting new rows added to the DataTable. strongAny new rows added to the table do not appear in the grid.strong The grid may also throw exceptions if you use the arrow keys to move the current cell selection off the bottom end of the grid, because the underlying data source has more rows but the grid has not created grid rows to display them.p  pSo, two possible solutions that I can seep  ol lipIs there a better way to suppress binding updates while making changes to the underlying DataTablepli lipIs there an easy way to tell the DataGridView to gracefully refresh its grid row collection to match the number of underlying DataTable rows Note Ive tried calling BindingSource.ResetBindings, but it seems to trigger more exceptions if you have emremovedem rows from the DataTablepli ol

Negative 729 pIn GXT, codeMessageBoxcode methods are asynchronous, meaning that the application does not lock up while the message box is displayed.p  pI using a codeKeyListenercode to process enter key presses in a form to increase usability, i.e., allowing the form to be submitted by the enter key and subsequently disabling the form fields while the application processes the users credentials.

However, since codealertcode returns immediately, the form fields are immediately made available again, allowing the user to input data without closing the alert.p  pThe solution is to use a callback in codealertcode however, the enter keypress not only causes the form to submit, but also causes the alert to immediately dismiss as if both the form and the message box are processing the enter key.

Negative 729 pReport design, generation and maintenance isnt hard, but it is dull. We have a number of legacy to quite different degrees of legacy reports in Crystal Reports XI.

A lot of time has been sunk in getting these reports to look emjust soem. The actual creation of reports is mostly done via the .NETC API and exported to PDF. There are a number of locally developed and maintained applications that are stable and handle this process well. p  pSo we like the fact that Crystal Reports is stable, that our apps produce these reports reliably, that the PDF output is consistent and that when the Crystal Reports template is approved and set, it just works. p  pThere are some big problems with this situation though. The biggest being that any changes to the underlying report templates themselves are a huge pain getting the Crystal Reports template to a point that users are happy is a royal hassle and can involve a long iteration of DTPgraphicsdatabasereconciliation and myriad other niggles. p  pCombine that with Crystal Reports being a relatively rare skill and not one people want to admit to, we are trying to think up alternative solutions. p  pSome thoughts Ive started to consider  and any others welcome p  ul liDoes Crystal Reports 2008 offer any benefits over XI li liHow have others managed a migration away from CR And what to li liGiven the data access layer is well formed, perhaps generate graphs via an Excel service and then import them as graphics to a framework template Crystal, another  has anyone tried anything like this li liIs Reporting Services any better We have some RS skillz but again, another thing that people are loath to actually own up to knowing anything about. li liAre there any layout tools available preferably with a .NET API for what, in the old days, would be called Desktop Publishing If we have graphicstablesother objects as images that could then be rendering automatically,  li ul  pIdeally I want to move to a solution where the users are in greater control of the underlying changes, and whether this can be handled programatically within tools that we can provide to them and so that I can be coding rather than editing Crystal Reports templates. p

Negative 729 pGiven a composite format string provided by the user for use with codeString.Formatcode and a set of types representing the arguments that would be used to format the composite format string, how can you check that the userprovided value is validp  pIt should be pretty easy to create a regular expression to check that the general syntax of the argument placeholders match codeindex[,alignment][formatString]code per a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarytxafckwd.aspx relnofollowthe documentationa.  And not too much more difficult to verify that the indexes of the placeholders in the composite format string are less than the actual number of typed arguments i.e. they dont reference an argument that wont be given.  However, given the types for the arguments that will be passed in are known, it should also be possible to validate the codeformatStringcode is appropriate for those types.p  pFor example, you want to validate the user doesnt specify code0dddd MMMMcode as a format string when the first argument type 0 index is a number codeString.Format0dddd MMMM, 1234code yields codedddd MMMMcode.  The quantity of codeformatStringcode options by type is a hrefhttpjohnsheehan.comblogwpcontentuploadsmsnetformattingstrings.pdf relnofollowtoo largea to want to manually check everything.

Negative 729 pI have a very simple online ordering app in Perl.  The user fills in a form, and when they submit, my app inserts the info into a mySql database, then redirects them to PayPal to complete the payment.

I end up having to manually reconcile a report from PayPal with my database to confirm payment for each order.p  pIs there anything like a callback from PayPal, where I could provide PayPal with a unique identifier for the order and PayPal could send back that identifier as confirmation that the order was paid, preferably through an HTTP request back to my server  Then I could update the order in my database with a paid flag.p
Negative 729 pThe question I have is this If I have the MethodInfo object, for a method, obtained from an interface type, and I also have the Type object for a class that implements this interface, but it implements the said method with an explicit implementation, how do I correctly obtain the corresponding MethodInfo object for the implementing method in that classp  pThe reason I need to do this is that implementing methods can have some attributes applied to them, and I need to find these through reflection, but the class that needs to find those attributes only have an object reference for the implementing class, and the Type object  corresponding MethodInfo objects for the interface.p  pSo, lets assume I have the following programp  precodeusing System using System.Reflection  namespace ConsoleApplication8      public interface ITest              void Test           public class Test  ITest              void ITest.Test                      throw new NotImplementedException                    class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      Type interfaceType  typeofITest             Type classType  typeofTest              MethodInfo testMethodViaInterface                  interfaceType.GetMethods[0]             MethodInfo implementingMethod                  classType.GetMethod  Test              Console.Out.WriteLineinterface                   testMethodViaInterface.Name             if implementingMethod  null                 Console.Out.WriteLineclass                       implementingMethod.Name             else                 Console.Out.WriteLineclass unable to locate              Console.Out.WritePress enter to exit...

Do not hesitate to critique my choice based on my crieriap  ol lipc is very low level and theres alot of coding to be done concerning data bound controls and so onpli lippowerbuilder is a 4gl and has excellent abstractions to avoid unneccessary coding. Sure, you give up a bit of control but how much control is required for an enterprise application C is an extremely powerful language and yes you can make literally anything in C. But Powerbuilder is more limited, and more can be done in PB when making stuff in its scope i.e. enterprise appspli lippowerbuilder is moving to .NET and it can be extended by using C for more sophisticated stuff.pli lipyes, i am aware theres a DataWindow.NET control which is excellent but however does not give assurances of longevity since Sybase may not continue supporting it after traction for PB.NET is seen. After all it will cannibalize sales for PB.NETpli ol

Negative 729 pI am writing refactoring a Silverlight program to consumes a portion of its existing business logic from a WCF service. In doing so, Ive run into the restriction in Silverlight 3 that only allows asynchronous calls to WCF services to avoid cases where longrunning or nonresponsive service calls block the UI thread SL has an interesting queuing model for invoking WCF services on the UI thread.p  pAs a consequence, writing what once was straightforward, is becoming rapidly more complex emsee the code examples at the end of my questionem.p  pIdeally, I would use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoroutinecoroutinesa to simplify the implementation, but sadly, C does not currently support coroutines as a native language facility. However, C does have the concept of generators iterators using the codeyield returncode syntax. My idea is to repurpose the yield keyword to allow me to build a simple coroutine model for the same logic.p  pI am reluctant to do this, however, because I am worried that there may be some hidden technical pitfalls that Im not anticipating given my relative inexperience with Silverlight and WCF. I am also worried that the implementation mechanism may not be clear to future developers and may hinder rather than simplify their efforts to maintain or extend the code in the future. Ive seen this question on SO about repurposing iterators to build state machines a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1194853implementingastatemachineusingtheyieldkeywordhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1194853implementingastatemachineusingtheyieldkeyworda, and while its not exactly the same thing Im doing, it does make me pause.p  pHowever, I need to do something to hide the complexity of the service calls and manage the effort and potential risk of defects in this type of change. I am open to other ideas or approaches I can use to solve this problem.p  pThe original nonWCF version of the code looks something like thisp  precodevoid ButtonClicked object sender, EventArgs e      using var bizLogic  new BusinessLogicLayer          try              var resultFoo  bizLogic.Foo             ... do something with resultFoo and the UI            var resultBar  bizLogic.BarresultFoo             ... do something with resultBar and the UI            var resultBaz  bizLogic.BazresultBar             ... do something with resultFoo, resultBar, resultBaz              codepre  pThe refactored WCF version becomes quite a bit more involved even without exception handling and prepost condition testingp  precode fields needed to manage distributedasync state private FooResponse mResultFoo   private BarResponse mResultBar private BazResponse mResultBaz private SomeServiceClient mService  void ButtonClicked object sender, EventArgs e       this.IsEnabled  false  disable the UI while processing async WECF call chain     mService  new SomeServiceClient     mService.FooCompleted  OnFooCompleted     mService.BeginFoo    called asynchronously by SL when service responds void OnFooCompleted FooResponse fr       mResultFoo  fr.Response      do some UI processing with resultFoo     mService.BarCompleted  OnBarCompleted     mService.BeginBar   void OnBarCompleted BarResponse br       mResultBar  br.Response      do some processing with resultBar     mService.BazCompleted  OnBazCompleted     mService.BeginBaz    void OnBazCompleted BazResponse bz       mResultBaz  bz.Response      ... do some processing with FooBarBaz results     mService.Dispose  codepre  pThe above code is obviously a simplification, in that it omits exception handling, nullity checks, and other practices that would be necessary in production code. Nonetheless, I think it demonstrates the rapid increase in complexity that begins to occur with the asynchronous WCF programming model in Silverlight. Refactoring the original implementation which didnt use a service layer, but rather had its logic embedded in the SL client is rapidly looking to be a daunting task. And one that is likely to be quite error prone.p  pThe coroutine version of the code would look something like this I have not tested this yetp  precodevoid ButtonClicked object sender, EventArgs e       PerformSteps ButtonClickCoRoutine    private IEnumerableltActiongt ButtonClickCoRoutine      using var service  new SomeServiceClient           FooResponse resultFoo         BarResponse resultBar         BazResponse resultBaz          yield return  gt              service.FooCompleted  r gt NextStep r, out resultFoo              service.BeginFoo                  yield return  gt               do some UI stuff with resultFoo             service.BarCompleted  r gt NextStep r, out resultBar              service.BeginBar                  yield return  gt               do some UI stuff with resultBar             service.BazCompleted  r gt NextStep r, out resultBaz              service.BeginBaz                  yield return  gt               do some processing with resultFoo, resultBar, resultBaz                 private void NextStepltTgt T result, out T store        store  result     PerformSteps   continues iterating steps   private IEnumerableltActiongt mStepsToPerform private void PerformSteps IEnumerableltActiongt steps      mStepsToPerform  steps    PerformSteps           private void PerformSteps     if mStepsToPerform  null          return  nothing to do     mStepsToPerform.MoveNext    var nextStep  mStepsToPerform.Current    if nextStep  null          mStepsToPerform.Dispose        mStepsToPerform  null        return  end of steps        nextStep  codepre  pThere are all sorts of things that need to be improved in the above code. But the basic premise is to factor out the continuation pattern creating an interception point for exception handling and various checks while allowing the eventbased async model of WCF to drive when each step is performed  basically when the last async WCF call completes. While on the surface this looks like more code, its worth mentioning that codePerformStepscode and codeNextStepcode are reusable, only the implementation in codeButtonClickCoRoutinecode would change with each different implementation site.p  pIm not entirely sure I like this model, and I wouldnt be surprised if a simpler way existed to implement it. But I havent been able to find one on the interwebs or MSDN, or anywhere else. Thanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 729 pIn short my question is How do you prefer to expose filteredsortedgrouped ObservableCollections to Views in WAFp  pI was fairly happy with my first attempt which involved filtering on the VM and exposing an ICollectionView of Model objects for the View to bind top  precodepublic StartDetailViewModelIStartDetailView view, StartPoint start, Scenario scenario          baseview              this.scenario  scenario         this.start  start          this.startsViewSource  new CollectionViewSource         this.startsViewSource.Filter  new FilterEventHandlerStartsFilter         this.startsViewSource.Source  scenario.Starts           public ICollectionView FilteredStarts              get                      return startsViewSource.View                   void StartsFilterobject sender, FilterEventArgs e              if e.Item  null                      e.Accepted  StartPointe.Item.Date  this.start                codepre  pHowever, exposing the Model objects directly is insufficient since each item now needs its own ViewModel. p  pSo, CollectionViewSource.Source is now attached to a collection of Views. The main problem with this is when applying filtersp  precodevoid StartsFilterobject sender, FilterEventArgs e      Since e.Item is now a view we are forced to ask the View for the ViewModel     StartItemViewModel vm  IStartItemViewe.Item.GetViewModelltStartItemViewModelgt     [...]  codepre  pThis feels wrong to me. Are there better approachesp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo I reverted to a CollectionViewSource.Source of Model objects and maintained a seperate collection of child View objects to which the View was bound.p  pThe question then of course is why am I using CollectionViewSource in a ViewModel at allp  pI think the following prinicple applies If the filteringsorting functionality is a property of the View only i.e. an alternate view might legitimately not provide such functionality then CollectionViews should be used in the View with codebehind as necessary. If the filteringsorting functionality is a dimension of the Model then this can be dealt with in the ViewModel or Model by other means.p  pThis makes sense once you realise that codebehind in MVVM views is perfectly acceptable.p  pAny commentsp
Negative 729 pJacob Orshalick author of Seam Framework Experience the Evolution of Java EE   saidp  blockquote   pOutjection allows you to make variables available from the current context for injection or access through EL. This can be beneficial if you want to loosely couple several components that inject the same context variable like the current user, the hotel being booked, etc. If you want to avoid outjection, an alternative is to use an Factory method or set the value directly into the context through Contexts.getConversationContext.setmyVarName, myVar p      pAnother benefit is performance. By outjecting a value to the context, you can bypass having to pass through your component to get that value. This is especially applicable in the case of data tables with JSF see this discussion. But, as you will see in the discussion you could also use BypassInterceptors to achieve the same benefit. p      pOutjection is really a convenience, but the same benefits can definitely be achieved through other means. Do note that outjection was not included in Web Beans and will either be deprecated or completely removed in Seam 3, so this is further reason to avoid it when possible.p blockquote  pWe have an application with a lot of outjections and weve started to get rid of them. He said p  blockquote   pbut the same benefits can definitely be achieved through other means.p blockquote  pbut which are these other means How to remove the outjections In ASP.NET for instance you have session variables. In Seam, you can outject var in session a benefit in some situations.p  pOr page scope for instance in jsf cycle the backing bean is called multiple times sometimes. You have an account which is loaded from an accountId page param. You can load the account, outject it with a page scope and you can use its properties greatly. OR to avoid outjection is to have a loadAccount method where you take the account from the db whenever you need it...WORSTp  pI do not think thatp  precodeContexts.getConversationContext.setmyVarName, myVar codepre  pis a method of how to avoid outjection. p  pThis only calls the same context where the outjected variable is saved and modifies it in a profound way i think its exactly what Out do in the background.p  pQuestion 1 What do you think guys about their intention Do you have specific info about how they will replace itp  pQuestion2 How do you avoid the use of outjectionp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 729 pIm testing a django app with selenium, and one of my pages uses the a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemostabsajax relnofollowjquery ui tabs elementa. One of the tabs contains a simple table listing some users, and is loaded via ajax. When using the app, the tab works just fine, but when automating the test with selenium, the tab doesnt appear to load its content Im writing the tests myself in python. At first, I was using the emclickem method of selenium RC, but as I painfully learned from a previous test, that is rather buggy when it comes to anchor tags, so I resorted to the solution I used before the waitforcondition method and explicitly called the tab click event and even the load event and nevertheless the tab was emstillem not workingbrbr     Im in despair here, the majority of my tests depend on that page and almost half of them are on that table, but, alas, it seems selenium is screwing up the javascript I have other tests in the class, and they run just fine, so nothing weird is going on at the server level, it seems to be a problem caused by selenium in the client side My test code is similar to thisp  precodeclass TestMyAppTransactionTestCase urls  myapp.testurls  def setUpself     self.verificationErrors  []     self.selenium  seleniumlocalhost, 4444, chrome, httplocalhost8000     self.selenium.start     self.selenium.setspeed2000     self.selenium.windowmaximize def testuserslistself     Test that an apps users are correctly listed     sel  self.selenium     users  []     for u in rangesettings.FREEUSERLIMIT2         users.appendself.app.users.createnametestUsersuuid4      sel.open             sel.waitforpagetoload30000     sel.waitforconditionselenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow.jQuerytabs.tabsselect,1     selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow.jQuerytabs.tabsload,1,                              3000     for user in users         try self.failUnlesssel.istextpresentuser.name         except AssertionError, e self.verificationErrors.appendstre         try self.failUnlesssel.istextpresentstruser.added.date         except AssertionError, e self.verificationErrors.appendstre def tearDownself     self.selenium.stop     self.assertEqual[], self.verificationErrors codepre

Negative 729 pC, ASP.NET 3.5 Environment Im using Microsofts DSOFile.dll for counting the pages in a word document .doc format. When I deployed my application to a medium trust environment GoDaddy I got a security exception. I narrowed my web service down to the line which is causing the problem, and it looks like it takes place in the following code blockp  precodeDSOFile.SummaryProperties props        DSOFile.OleDocumentPropertiesClass mDoc  new DSOFile.OleDocumentPropertiesClass     mDoc.OpenActualPath, true, DSOFile.dsoFileOpenOptions.dsoOptionDefault     props  mDoc.SummaryProperties     Pages  props.PageCount codepre  pIt gives me the security exception so long as the third line mDoc.Open is in there. When commented out, the file acts normally, and while it doesnt give counts for .doc files, it does count the other types of files i have cases set up for. I thought it may have something to do with Absolute vs Relative paths, but then I noticed that even when debugging locally after setting my trust level in my app to Medium it crashed without actually running any methods, and simply as a result of that line being in there. So, obviously Medium Trust and this method of file IO dont work. This behavior is the same for my web service through SOAP and JSON as well as on a test ASP.NET page I created. Does anyone know of an alternative method for achieving what I want to do in a Medium Trust environmentp

Negative 729 pThis question has less to do with actual code, and more to do with the underlying methods.p  pMy boss at my pseudointernship has requested that I write him a script that will scrape a list of links from a users tweet the list comes round once per week, and its always the same user and then publish said list to the companys Tumblr account.p  pCurrently, I am thinking about this structure The base will be a bash script that first calls some script that uses the Twitter API to find the post given a hashtag and parse the list current candidates for languages being Perl, PHP and Ruby, in no particular order. Then, the script will store the parsed list with some markup into a text file, from where another script that uses the Tumblr API will format the list and then post it.p  pIs this a sensible way to go about doing this So far in planning Im only up to getting the Twitter post, but Im already stuck between using the API to grab the post or just grabbing the feed they provide and attempting to parse it.

Negative 729 pI made a widget in Qt Designer with about a dozen controls organized into horiz. and vert. layouts.  Oddly, every horizontal layout wants to be some large size, about 400 px wide, when the whole form is set to be 275px wide.  Buttons etc contained within are too wide for the form.  When I resize the widget form vertically or horizontally sometimes with the max width turned off the various layouts wont resize.  Manually setting widths or min widths, or max widths may affect the sizes of the controls, but not their spacing within the layout.

Negative 729 pIm busy parsing xml documents google docs api and putting individual documents into objects.p  pThere are different types of documents documents, spreadsheets, presentations. Most information about these documents is the same, but some is different.p  pThe idea was to create a base document class which holds all the shared information, while using subclasses for each specific document type.p  pThe problem is creating the right classes for the different types. There are two ways to differentiate the type of the document. Each entry has a category element where I can find the type. Another method that will be used is by the resourceId, in the form of codetypeidcode. p  pThe most naive option will be to create an ifstatement or switchstatement checking the type of the entry, and create the corresponding object for it. But that would require to edit the code if a new type would be added.p  pNow im not really sure if there is another way to solve this, so thats the reason Im asking it here.

Negative 729 pOk so Im working on an ASP MVC Web Application that queries a fairly large amount of data from an SQL Server 2008. When the application starts, the user is presented with a search mask that includes several fields. Using the search mask, the user can search for data in the data base and also filter the search by specifying parameters in the mask. In order to speed up searching Im storing the result set returned by the data base query in the server session. During subsequent searches I can then search the data I have in the session thus avoiding unecessary trips to the DB.p  pSince the amount of data that can be returned by a data base query can be quite large, the scalability of the web application is severily limited. If there are, lets say, 100 users using the application at the same time, the server will keep search results in its session for each separate user. This will eventually eat up quite a bit of memory. My question now is, whats the best alternative to storing the data in session The query in the DB can take quite a while at times so, at the moment, I would like to avoid having to run the query on subsequent searches if the data I already retrieved earlier contains the data that is now being searched for. Options Ive considered are creating a temp table in the DB in my search query that stores the retrieved data and which can be used for subsequent searches. The problem with that is, I dont have all too much experience with SQL Server so I dont know if the SQL Server would create temp tables for each user if there are multiple users performing the search. Are there any other possibilities Could the idea with the temp table in the SQL Server work or would it only lead to memory issues on the SQL Server Thanks for the help p  pEdit Thanks a lot for the helpful and insightful answers, guys However, I failed to mention a detail thats kind of important. When I query the database, the format of the result set can vary from user to user. This is because the user can decide which columns the result table can have by selecting columns from a predefined multiselect box in the search mask. If user A wants ColA, ColB and ColC to be displayed in his result table, he selects those values from the multiselect box in the search mask. User B, however, might select ColA and ColC only. Therefore, caching the results in a single table for all users might be a bit tricky since the table columsn are not necessarily going to be the same for all users. Therefore, Im thinking, Ill almost have to use an alternative that saves each users cached table separately. The HTML5 Local Storage alternative option mentioned below sounds interesting. Since this is an intranet application, it might be fair to assume or require that users have an up to date browser that supports HTML5. What do you guys think Again, thanks for the help p

Negative 729 pIm working on a website and I used CodeIgniter as my framework, but Im getting increasingly frustrated with the way they abuse OOP. Im not a fan of OOP but when I use it I prefer a decent implementation. So Ive decided to quickly build a PHP framework. Anyways, Im stuck with the usual MVC architecture for my application but I was wondering what is a good way of passing around models to controllers and libraries. I would prefer to provide an instance of a model to the constructor of a controller. Something along these linesp  precodeclass MyController implements IController whatever      public MyControllerIUrlRouteModel urlroutemodel, IUserModel usermodel              usual assignment           public someaction               UserEntity users  usermodelgtfindall       codepre  pIm using PHP but this examplequestion is not directly linked to just PHP, the answer should tho. Now the real question is, where in my could would I manage the instance of the models, where couldshould I create them. I will probably call the controller somewhere in the Router but passing every model to the constructor of the router would be strange. Is there someone who can shed some light on this subject. Ive tried to find out how other frameworks do this and this is what i have so farp  ol liThey use a ModelKeeper that functions as some type of factory for the models, I kind off like this option but the source of that class will get messyli liThe models are provided in static context. Either every method of the model is static, or they use some type of singleton pattern.li ol  pShare your experience stackoverflow What would be a good way to implement this Or shorter, what would be an appropriate place to instantiate the models and howp  pPS I guess the model would look something like thisp  precodeclass UserModel implements IUserModel       public UserModelDatabaseConnection dbc       store for later use   codepre

This adds confusion to the UI and is not a good enough solution.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

If the amount was code1000000000code one billion, the string would be code1bcodep  pI also need to round the number, so say the amount was code5555555code, the string would be code5.5mcodep

Negative 729 pI know how to setup nested resources in the routes files already the question is for how to do it optionally with the same payload, and with fewer lines.p  pLets say I have a codeBlogSitecode.

I know that you can use something like p  precodeget blogsitesblogidauthorauthoriddatedateidposts gt postsindex codepre  pbut I dont want to lose all the CRUD benefits of using nested resource routing. Currently I have to duplicate much of the routing to make it work, and am looking for a better way to do thisp  precoderesources blogsites do     resources authors do         resources dates do             resources posts         end         resources posts     end     resources dates do         resources posts     end     resources posts end codepre  p and so on.

Negative 729 pI love a hrefhttpwww.rubyinside.comrubytechniquesrevealedautoload1652.htmlthe autoload functionality of Rubya however, its a hrefhttpblade.nagaokaut.ac.jpcgibinscat.rbrubyrubycore41149going away in future versions of Rubya since it was never threadsafe.p  pSo right now I would like to pretend its already gone and write my code without it, by strongimplementing the lazyloading mechanism myselfstrong. Id like to implement it in the simplest way possible I dont care about threadsafety right now. Ruby should allow us to do this.p  pLets start by augmenting a class codeconstmissingcodep  precodeclass Dummy   def self.constmissingconst     puts constmissingconst.inspect     superconst   end end codepre  pRuby will call this special method when we try to reference a constant under Dummy thats missing, for instance if we try to reference DummyHello, it will call codeconstmissingcode with the Symbol codeHellocode. This is exactly what we need, so lets take it furtherp  precodeclass Dummy   def self.constmissingconst     if OAuth  const       require dummyoauth       constgetconst       warning possible endless loop     else       superconst     end   end end codepre  pNow if we reference DummyOAuth, it will require the dummyoauth.rb file which is expected to define the DummyOAuth constant. Theres a possibility of an endless loop when we call codeconstgetcode since it can call codeconstmissingcode internally, but guarding against that is outside the scope of this question.p  pstrongThe big problem is, this whole solution breaks down if there exists a module named OAuth in the toplevel namespace.strong Referencing DummyOAuth will skip its codeconstmissingcode and just return the OAuth from the toplevel. Most Ruby implementations will also make a warning about thisp  precodewarning toplevel constant OAuth referenced by DummyOAuth codepre  pa hrefhttpmarkmail.orgthreadxc2ayt7t6r4gnllequery3apage1mid3agosubmykturvkvlzstate3aresultsThis was reported as a problem way back in 2003a but I couldnt find evidence that the Ruby core team was ever concerned about this. Today, most popular Ruby implementations carry the same behavior.p  pThe problem is that codeconstmissingcode is silently skipped in favor of a constant in the toplevel namespace. This wouldnt happen if DummyOAuth was declared with Rubys codeautoloadcode functionality. Any ideas how to work around thisp

Here is a simple example of what Im seeing p  precodevoid Run      CallDoSomethingltProgramgtHello World, new object     CallDoSomethingltProgramgtHello World2, new Listltintgt    DoSomethingltTgt represents the functions that do the heavy lifting public T DoSomethingltTgtstring someString, Listltintgt ints where T  class      Console.WriteLineListltintgt 0, someString     return defaultT  public T DoSomethingltTgtstring someString, object ints where T  class      Console.WriteLineobject 0, someString      In my real implementation, this turns the object to a typed ListltTgt      and passes it to the previous overload.     return defaultT    Were trying to refactor the code in this method to reduce code duplication in  the CallDoSomethingltTgt methods that will actually be called by the end user internal T CallDoSomethingltT, Ugtstring someString, U ints where T  class       Do a bunch of stuff here that would otherwise be duplicated by the CallDoSomethingltTgt methods     return DoSomethingltTgtsomeString, ints   public T CallDoSomethingltTgtstring someString, Listltintgt ints where T  class      return CallDoSomethingltT, ListltintgtgtsomeString, ints  public T CallDoSomethingltTgtstring someString, object ints where T  class      return CallDoSomethingltT, objectgtsomeString, ints  codepre  pIn this case, the resulting output isp  precodeobject Hello World object Hello World2 codepre  pWhile I was expecting it to bep  precodeobject Hello World Listltintgt HelloWorld2 codepre  pIt kind of makes sense that both cases were directed to the overload taking an codeobjectcode parameter since both of them are objects. I suspect this is happening because from what I know Generics and overload resolution are handled at compile time rather than runtime. p  pThe first alternative that came to me was to use Reflection to invoke the call dynamically in codeCallDoSomethingltT, Ugtcode, but that felt too dirty. Instead the solution Ive come up with involves passing a delegate to codeCallDoSomethingltT, Ugtcode which seems to work. Heres what it looks likep  precodevoid Run      CallDoSomethingltProgramgtHello World, new object     CallDoSomethingltProgramgtHello World2, new Listltintgt   public T DoSomethingltTgtstring someString, Listltintgt ints where T  class      Console.WriteLineListltintgt 0, someString     return defaultT  public T DoSomethingltTgtstring someString, object ints where T  class      Console.WriteLineobject 0, someString     return defaultT   internal delegate T DoSomethingDelegateltT, Ugtstring someString, U ints where T  class internal T CallDoSomethingltT, Ugtstring someString, U ints, DoSomethingDelegateltT, Ugt doSomething where T  class       Do a bunch of stuff here that would otherwise be duplicated by the CallDoSomethingltTgt methods     return doSomethingsomeString, ints   public T CallDoSomethingltTgtstring someString, Listltintgt ints where T  class      return CallDoSomethingltT, ListltintgtgtsomeString, ints, DoSomethingltTgt  public T CallDoSomethingltTgtstring someString, object ints where T  class      return CallDoSomethingltT, objectgtsomeString, ints, DoSomethingltTgt  codepre  pThis seems to work and it removes a large amount of code duplication, but it makes the code fairly convoluted. Is there a better way to approach this problemp
Negative 729 pApologies in advance for a rather nonspecific question p  pI am looking for some guidance on how best to get a Rails app to talk to FBTwitter etc and I see that there are options like Koala httpsgithub.comarsduokoala for FB and others for Twitter and so on.p  pBut then, theres also OmniAuth  which is for Authentication  but again for FBTwitterLinkedIn etc. p  pSo how do the pieces of this puzzle fit together  do I need to use embothem OmniAuth and Koala for example if my Rails app needs to integrate with FB Do I need just one Is there something one uses OmniAuth for first and then Koala for the rest A few sentences about the lay of the land here would really help me understand what each does and how they fit together.p  pThanksp
Negative 729 pOk, Im sure that title was confusing, but what were trying to do is actually pretty simple.  To explain the calculation, consider a cylinder drawn in 3D space given the two endpoints of its centerline and a diameter.  Now draw its silhouette against the plane of the screen, but square off the ends so they are parallel with each other and to the screens plane.  Thats the look we need.p  pNow we could simply do exactly that... draw a cylinder with flat lighting to get this effect.  However, since were not actually displaying the 3D shading, calculating all of the triangles that makes up the surface of the cylinder would be complete overkill.p  pTechnically, all we need is a single quad, or at most, two triangles.  If the conceptual cylinder is parallel to the screen, then the result would just be a rectangle.  If the cylinder is angled towards or away from the screen, then the resulting silhouette is a simple trapezoid. Heres an example...p  ul liA. Parallel to the screen, close  li liB. Parallel to the screen, far  li liC. Angled away from the screen, topleft near to bottomright far  li liD. Angled towards the screen, bottomleft far to topright near  li ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMWcoC.png altenter image description herep  pAll we would like to do is basically specify the end points of the center line red in 3D space along with the width of the ribbon.  But to do all of that, you need to not only take into consideration the endpoints in 3D space, but where the camera is too to determine how to make the ends parallel to the viewing plane as not to skew their width, and at that point, you may as well just go back to a cropped silhouette of a transformed cylinderp  pSo can anyone suggest a nice, simple way to do thisp

Negative 729 pI have a bluetooth connection to a device that sends data as a byte array. The byte array is then changed to a string with new Stringbyte[], offset, bytecount.

The app starts to lag more and more as the loops increase as well.p  pIs there a way to free the memory of the new string object right after I use it or better yet, is there a way to change the byte array to a string strongemor even a floatemstrong without creating a new objectp  pWorse case, is there a way to give the app more memory so the error happens much laterp

Negative 729 pI am currently developing an application that needs to record audio, encode it as AAC, stream it, and do the same in reverse  receiving stream, decoding AAC and playing audio.p  pI successfully recorded AAC wrapped in a MP4 container using the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidmediaMediaRecorder.htmlMediaRecordera, and successfully upstreamed audio using the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidmediaAudioRecord.htmlAudioRecorda class. But, I need to be able to encode the audio as I stream it, but none of these classes seem to help me do that.p  pI researched a bit, and found that most people that have this problem end up using a native library like strongffmpegstrong.p  pBut I was wondering, since Android already includes strongStageFrightstrong, that has native code that can do encoding and decoding for example, a hrefhttpsgithub.comandroidplatformframeworksbaseblobmastermedialibstagefrightincludeAACEncoder.hAAC encodinga and a hrefhttpsgithub.comandroidplatformframeworksbaseblobmastermedialibstagefrightincludeAACDecoder.hAAC decodinga, is there a way to use this native code on my application How can I do thatp  pIt would be great if I only needed to implement some JNI classes with their native code. Plus, since it is an Android library, it would be no licensing problems whatever correct me if Im wrong.p

I have been trying to get the protobufnet library to work for me but have the following problemp  pWhen I write my dictionary to file I also put the offset that a record starts into an index file and I think that the serialization works OK, but when I look an entry up I get the correct offset but the DictionaryEntrys Definitions property contains all of the DictionaryDefinitions from then on thousands of them. The first DictionaryDefinition in the List is the correct one for the term searched for.  p  pI have tried implementing this as both a Property and as a Public member, to no success. I have also tried SkipConstructor  true in the ProtoContract attribute and OverwriteList  true in the ProtoMember attribute. p  precode[ProtoContract]  public class DictionaryEntry      [ProtoMember1]     public string EntryKey  get set      [ProtoMember2]     public ListltDictionaryDefinitiongt Definitions get set    [ProtoContract] public class DictionaryDefinition      [ProtoMember1]     public string PartOfSpeech  get set      [ProtoMember2]     public string Definition  get set   codepre  pI dont think that Ive done anything particularly dumb in the rest of my code, but if anyone could suggest anything for this part, Id like to exclude this. p  pThanks,p  pMp

Negative 729 pIm writing some code for an iPhone app, and Im having issues getting default data to load in correctly.  I am basing my code off some example from the Learning Cocos2d book by Ray Wenderlich.  p  pIt seems that even when I delete the app outright and try to start from fresh data that the app inconsistently either doesnt try to load the data, or incorrectly thinks that there is data, and loads null.  p  pIm using containsValueForKey to check if a value exists and then load it or load some default value, but even on a fresh installation the containsValueForKey finds data and doesnt load the defaults.  In xcodes organizer I checked my devices file structure and the Documents folder, where I specified to save, doesnt look like it contains any files, so Im not sure what its grabbing.  p  pMy guess is that the problem is something to do with the initWithCoder function.  It seems to mysteriously go through the function sometimes, but not all the time.

Negative 729 pso we set up some installations in a science center, where the end results are images and videos, which are uploaded to a server which is available from the outside web.

We got this working with the current working API, and the login popup shows up, people can log in and then it gets shared.p  pOur problem is that the login popup box also has some unwanted features, which enables you to end up inside the facebook system itself.  This is not good for the center as they dont want this to become a web browsing station.  p  pSo, my question is  how would I be able to allow people to log in and share specific content without allowing them to browse further and further into the facebook site  Can I cover up the about links in the popup box, or in some other way work around the matterp  pThanx for any suggestion.p

Negative 729 pI know that immutable objects always have the same state, the state in which they are actually created. Their invariants are establised by the constructor and since their state does not change after construction , those invariants always hold good and this is why they are safe to publish in a multi threaded environment. This is all fine but since we live in a dynamic world , where the state of program changes continuously , what benefits do such objects give us if we construct the state of our program through immutable objectsp

Negative 729 pIve been searching around, but it seems that I have a slightly different case of everyones favorite problems TSP, Hamiltonian, Eulerian, etc. I have a graph, represented by V vertices and E edges, where each edge is undirected and has a certain cost to traverse. I want to traverse every single edge, with possible repeats, at minimal cost.p  pIntuitively, the problem feels NPhard, since it is so related to other NPhard problems. However, I realize that since the path can repeat edges, it is potentially easier.p  pMy first thought was to transform the edges into vertices and the vertices into nodes and try to analyze it like a Hamiltonian. However, that has the restriction of visiting every node only once, and I cant find any information about a relaxation of the problem where a node can be visited more than once.p  pDoes anyone know if Im just bad at searching and that this is actually a problem that is known about and studiedp

Negative 729 pI have a situation in which several search procedures are parallelized into different threads.  Each thread gets the same codepymongo.cursor.Cusorcode objects to look through for its results, but each thread performs different processing.  I created a demo procedure that just looks like thisp  precodeclass SearchProcedureThread      weight  0.1      def initself,weightNone         if weight             self.weight  floatweight         Thread.initself      def startself,query         self.query  query         Thread.startself      def runself         if hasattrself,places             for p in self.places.values                 print p.name          if hasattrself,posts             for s in self.posts.values                 s.rewind                 print [sh[name],sh[description] for sh in s]      def attacheligibleself,queue,kwargs         self.queue  queue         for name,value in kwargs.items             setattrself,name,value codepre  pThe codeattacheligiblecode method is where the properties for places and posts are added to the procedure object.  Again, the codepostscode property is a set of mongo cursors that can be iterated through.  I use coderewindcode before running through the results to reset the cursor to its original state if another thread has already unwound it.  The idea is the each thread will use different criteria to search the objects and then emit its results into the codequeuecode property for use in the callinginstantiating scope.p  pThe first thread runs through fine, but all subsequent threads the utilize the cursor output the following errorp  precode  File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagespymongocursor.py, line 668, in sendmessage     assert response[startingfrom]  self.retrieved AssertionError codepre  pRewinding, it would seem, has no effect.  Is this because the cursors are passed in by reference  Would they too need to be contained within a queue to preserve lock status  Is it even possible to do something like this with mongo cursors  It would be nice if I could, since it would make the processing of the search criteria much more performant to have it executed concurrently.p
Negative 729 pI am subclassing a codeUIViewControllercode and instantiating a codeUIScrollViewcode in its view which has a height of 480 and a width of 640 2x the regular width. Paging is enabled, so its essentially 2 views side by side that you can see either of by swiping back and fourth. My end goal is to have my view controller notified whenever the user swipes to switch sides. I am trying to use the codeUIScrollViewDelegatecode method codescrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimationsscrollViewcode, but its not getting called. I have the delegate set to the view controller correctly, because the other delegate method codescrollViewDidScrollscrollViewcode, gets called many times during a single scroll. Any ideas as to how I can fix this  accomplish what Id likep
Negative 729 pI was wondering if Amazon Cloudfront can pass to the origin server the CDN domain name the request is coming from. Let me explain.p  ul liI have an external LAMP server, associated to an origin domain e.g. origin.mydomain.comli liIve successfully set up Cloudfront, setting origin.mydomain.com as origin serverli liFinally, I pointed 2 different CDN domains to Cloudfront e.g. www.firstdomain.com and www.seconddomain.comli ul  pNow, all this setup is working perfectly.p  pBut there is 1 information Im missing when the origin server origin.mydomain.com receives a request, I havent found a way to know if the request originally comes from www.firstdomain.com or www.seconddomain.com cloudfront sends to the origin server all information about the request, except the original CDN domain  or if it does, I dont know howwhere to get it.p  pSo, resuming, I have thisp  pDNS domains  Cloudfront  Origin domain  LAMP Serverp  pThe question is how can LAMP get the DNS domain name the request is originally coming fromp  pDo I miss any cloudfront setting, or there is some trick I can use to get that info p  pNote I know I can create several properties pointing to the same origin server, but that is not a viable solution for this project.p
Negative 729 pI see a lot of applications in the Mac App store, such as a hrefhttpflavio.tordini.orgminitube relnofollowMiniTubea and a hrefhttpcloudplay.fm relnofollowCloudPlaya, which appear to stream high quality video directly from YouTube, without using any sort of embedded player.p  pHowever, I dont see any means of doing this through the documented API. Is their scraping e.g. a hrefhttpgitorious.orgminitubeminitubeblobsmastersrcvideo.cpp relnofollowhttpgitorious.orgminitubeminitubeblobsmastersrcvideo.cppa illegalagainst the TOS, or merely undocumented and unsupported Is there a better way of doing itp  pIn particular, the socalled chromeless iframe player actually has a significant amount of chromeuser interaction, which is more suitable for a website than for a native application.p  pEDIT  I suppose my question is primarily for the official YouTube developer support is scraping the page for the stream against the TOS If it is, why are these apps allowed to remain on the app store, and if it isnt, what is the best way of doing sop

Negative 729 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiu472.png altenter image description herep  pI would like to make a gui that looks like the above. right now I have a panel which will hold the name label, name textfield, brith date label and birthday textfield. My question is what would be the best layout manager to use on the panel so that the row of name components lable  textfield and the row of birth date components lable  textfield, would be evenly spread vertically in the panel.p  pI thought about using flow layout, but that would result in no gap between the two rows of components. I thought about using a grid layout, but I do not know the gap size between the two rows of components.p  pA more complicated approach...i thought about putting the name label and textfield in one panel, and the birth date label and textfield in another panel, then make the base panel border layout and set name to be north, birthdate to be south...but then i would still have to make sure the name components are vertically centered in the name panel and birthdate components are vertically centered in the birth date panel. p  pAny help is appreciated. The goal is to make sure the row of name components and the row of birth date components are vertically spread out, with the name components being centered vertically on the top half, and the birth date components centered vertically on the bottom half. If anything sounds confusing please let me know Ill try to rephrase for a better understanding.p  pI am using strictly Java swing with eclipse, no GUI builder or anything like that.p

Negative 729 pBasically Im using lua a native dll for scripting from c. I followed a tutorial to recompile the lua dll using the correct calling convention and import the needed functions.p  pTheres a specific function thats crashing my program every time I call it. It takes a string from the native environment which I put there earlier with a different api call and returns it again as a managed string.p  pI have 3 seperate .net projects. The first project is a shared project that wraps up all the native calls nice and neat into a .net dll. The other two use the shared project. One is a GUI application using Windows.Forms and the other is a console application. p  pEverything works fine from the Console application, but every time I call that function I mentioned from the GUI project it crashes immediately without exceptions or erorr. I tried calling the function from the watch pane while debugging and it said Function evaluation was abandoned and a few seconds later the debugger exits.p  pIm 100 positive that there is no difference in how Im calling it from the GUI program and the console program, even though one works and the other doesnt. I should mention Im developing primarily on windows 7 64 bit, but when I debugged on my laptop which is windows xp 32 bit the gui program mysteriously worked.p  pI suspect the problem has something to do with marshaling which admittedly I know little about or some other detail Im unaware of. I do marshall the string as a UnmanagedType.LPStr before pushing into the native environment. p  pIm not looking for a comprehensive answer or anything though if you have one, by all means, lets hear it. Im just looking for a bit of direction on how to go about fixing something like this.p

Negative 729 pI just began doing my first steps with WCF services and made up a little WPF application that displays data retrieved from a WCF service. I split the application into two projects a project containing the WPF UI and a second project containing the WCF service client.p  pAfter copying the endpoint definition from the app.config of the second project to the app.config of the first project which is, of course, the StartUp project the application is running now.p  pBut since I began using the WCF service client, the XAML designer does not work anymore. It always shows the exceptionp  pemCould not find default endpoint element that references contract MyContract in the ServiceModel client configuration section. This might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element.emp  pThis is exactly the same exception that I got before copying the endpoint definition to the other app.config file. So I guess the XAML designer doesnt use this configuration. Is it possible to fix this weird behavior It would be okay for me if the XAML designer wont use the WCF at all which it shouldnt do anyway IMHO and just use some default data.p  pI already thought about stubbing the WCF service client in the emDesignerModeem case using RhinoMocks, but stubbing the asynchronous WCF calls isnt the easiest thing to do.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 729 pI have a couple textboxes in a templatefield of an ASP.NET gridview that I want to use a a hrefhttptrentrichardson.comexamplestimepicker relnofollowdatetime pickera both date and time portions. Due to the way ASP.NET generates the front end ID of controls, the easiest way to select the textboxes is by class.

If there was a single textbox andor I had the ClientID beforehand, I could set the defaultValue relatively easily. But the actual HTML ClientID of the textboxes dont end with the asp id so I cant use an endswith function codeContentPlaceHolder1GridView1tbStartDate0code and I cant use codelt tbStartDate.ClientID gtcode since the textboxes are only generated after the Update button is pushed.

Negative 729 pWe are using SubSonic 2.1 to get information from our SQL database. I noticed that when we execute a stored procedure by means of a data set the information gets pulled back fairly quick. When we execute the store procedure by ExecuteTypedList it takes a good 2030 seconds to pull the info. The stored procedure in stand alone takes 45 seconds every time. I have changed the call to the stored procedure so it does not use subsonic at all and it pulls the info back in the same 45 seconds. Is there any reason why subsonic would be causing an issue to pull back the info The query itself is only returning 1 line of results.p

Negative 729 pIm trying to debug a problem in our ASP.Net application, whereby the first page access can take up to five minutes.  This site runs in .Net 3.5 and has 100 ascx controls and 25 aspx pages, so its not small.p  pWhat Ive noticed is that when the site is really slow to load the Temporary ASP.Net files folder is being repopulated.

But under regular recompilations, maybe a file or two changed, the site comes up in 30 seconds after a rebuild.  p  pWhat I dont understand is when the folder is cleared out sometimes even after I run a clean and rebuild all on the solution, with an iisreset and web.config change thrown in for good measure, that folder has nearly the same number of files as before when the site reloads and it only takes 30 seconds to come up.  We are using the optimizeCompilations flag in web.configp  pOther times, under other build circumstances I cant explain, were back to the 5 minute load times as the folder completely rebuilds itself.  p  pWhen is this folder cleared out and is there anything I can do to speed up its repopulation time when it needs to start from scratch  70 megabytes in 5 minutes seems a little slowp

Negative 729 pi have a Problem, written a Webapp in CakePHP 1.3 and it worked fine, so i wanted to use the newer cake version and after copying it on my local Apache which might have the correct configuration until the older Cake runs fine it displays the Error that modrewrite isnt working.

When using MockRepositories this works fine so I know that side of things is working. p  pHowever when I replace the mocks with ones that use Entity Framework, although all the registrations appear to be correct and working, I get the error The context cannot be used while the model is being created.p  pI have included my code belowp  precodepublic class SomeObject      public int Id  get set      public class IoCExampleContext  DbContext, IIoCExampleContext       public IDbSetltSomeObjectgt SomeObjects  get set       static IoCExampleContext              Database.SetInitializernew IoCExampleDatabaseInitilizer           public IoCExampleContextstring connectionStringName          baseconnectionStringName              Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled  false           public IoCExampleContext          thisnameIoCExample            public string ConnectionString              get  return Database.Connection.ConnectionString             protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              base.OnModelCreatingmodelBuilder         BuildModelsmodelBuilder           private void BuildModelsDbModelBuilder builder              var typeToUse  typeofSomeObjectModelBuilder         var namespaceToUse  typeToUse.Namespace          var toReg  Assembly                         .GetAssemblytypeToUse                         .GetTypes                         .Wheretype gt type.Namespace  null ampamp type.Namespace.StartsWithnamespaceToUse                         .Wheretype gt type.BaseType.IsGenericType ampamp type.BaseType.GetGenericTypeDefinition  typeofEntityTypeConfigurationltgt          foreach object configurationInstance in toReg.SelectActivator.CreateInstance                      builder.Configurations.AdddynamicconfigurationInstance                   public class IoCExampleDatabaseInitilizer  CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsltIoCExampleContextgt      protected override void SeedIoCExampleContext context               public interface IRepositoryltTEntitygt where TEntity  class      IQueryableltTEntitygt GetQuery     IEnumerableltTEntitygt GetAll     IEnumerableltTEntitygt WhereExpressionltFuncltTEntity, boolgtgt predicate       ...Various standard CRUD calls     public class GenericRepositoryltTEntitygt  IRepositoryltTEntitygt where TEntity  class      protected DbContext context     private readonly DbSetltTEntitygt dbSet      public GenericRepositoryDbContext context              context  context         dbSet  context.SetltTEntitygt           public IQueryableltTEntitygt GetQuery              return dbSet           public IEnumerableltTEntitygt GetAll              return GetQuery.AsEnumerable           public IEnumerableltTEntitygt WhereExpressionltFuncltTEntity, boolgtgt predicate              return GetQuery.Wherepredicate            ...Various standard CRUD calls      public void Dispose              OnDisposetrue           protected void OnDisposebool disposing              if disposing                      if context  null                              context.Dispose                 context  null                               public class DependencyBootstrapper      private ContainerBuilder builder      public IContainer Start              builder  new ContainerBuilder         builder.RegisterFilterProvider         RegisterControllers         return builder.Build           private void RegisterControllers              RegisterAssemblyAssembly.GetExecutingAssembly         builder.RegisterModelBinderProvider          RegisterPerLifetimeConnections         RegisterRepositories         RegisterServices           private void RegisterAssemblyAssembly assembly              builder.RegisterModelBindersassembly         builder.RegisterControllersassembly           private void RegisterRepositories              builder.RegisterGenerictypeofGenericRepositoryltgt.AstypeofIRepositoryltgt          builder.RegisterTypeltGenericRepositoryltSomeObjectgtgt.AsltIRepositoryltSomeObjectgtgt         ...

Negative 729 pIm using d3 to create two line graphs that can both be zoomed in when the user drags across a range of one of the graphs. Ive been able to implement it by compeletely redrawing each graph at the end of the drag event, but Id like to just do an update and possibly do an animated transition. For some reason, the graphs start to update, but they dont plot the new data, so they just become empty graphs instead, even when its just one graph updating. Ive done console.lognewdata before and after the attempt to update, and there is plenty of data in the array, and its formatted the same as the original data. I do have an awful lot of points thousands, but Ive seen d3 examples that handle such large datasets pretty well, at least as line graphs. Using Firebug, I get no errors, and the function completes the rect gets removed. I realize Ill need to also update the scale, but Id like to at least get the data updating first. Im pretty new to d3, so I wouldnt be surprised if I were just doing something stupid. Any help much appreciated.p  pHere is the code that draws the line, followed by the code that handles the drag event.p  precodevar line  d3.svg.line     .xfunctiondreturn xscaled.x     .yfunctiondreturn yscaled.y d3.selectgraph  pointnum   svg g         .appendpath         .attrd, linedata         .attrclass, distline  var dragrect   var dragit  d3.behavior.drag     .ondragstart, function         omsiglobals.startx  Math.roundd3.mousethis[0]         dragrect  d3.selectgraph  pointnum   svg g             .appendrect                 .attrx, omsiglobals.startx                 .attry, 0                 .attrwidth, 1                 .attrheight, omsiglobals.chartdimensions.height                 .attrfill, gray                 .attropacity, .1          .ondrag, function         var currx  d3.mousethis[0]         ifomsiglobals.startx gt currx              dragrect.transition                 .attrx, currx                 .attrwidth, Math.abscurrx  omsiglobals.startx                 .delay0                 .duration10                  else dragrect.transition                 .attrwidth, Math.abscurrx  omsiglobals.startx                 .delay0                 .duration10          .ondragend, function         var startx  omsiglobals.startx         var endx  Math.roundd3.mousethis[0]         make sure the drag covered more than one pixel.

Negative 729 pjust had a look at class CopyOnWriteArrayList and I wondered why its get... method doesnt need any synchronization.

Okay, the underlying array is declared volatilep  precodeprivate volatile transient Object[] array codepre  pBut I dont see how using volatile makes any synchronisation redundant. It only prevents the reference stored in array from being cached by the compiler.

Negative 729 pI have a site that uses Spring security and has users username amp password and standard form authentication.  I allow users to generate a client Id and client secret linked to their account for use with an OAuth2 secured rest API.  p  pI use a separate client id amp client secret for the API and not username and password so the user can change their password etc without breaking the API credentials, set specific scopes, disable API access etc.p  pI use springsecurityoauth2 provider to secure the rest API and I have allowed a client credentials flow. I have setup client authentication for the api so that client id and secret are checked.p  pFrom a separate application I use the client id and client secret to retreive an access token and start to use it with the api.  For the most part I use simple PreAuthorize expressions typically based on client roles and scope and these appear to work correctly.p  pstrongAll above appears to work finestrongp  pHowever... I have a few API endpoints now however where I need to implement some more complex rules based on some details from the underlying user  in this case the user that generated the client id and secret.p  pAs a simple example consider a messaging application where I have an endpoint that allows users to post a new message of a specific type that can vary.  I have a table of allowed recipients for each user and each type and I want to check that the recipients of the posted message match the allowed recipient for the type.  User allowed recipients data is typically not large, and rarely changes so Im happy to store a copy of it when generating an access tokenp  pI get the principal at these endpoints and I see it is an instance of OAuth2Authentication containingp  ul liuserAuthentication  null  This seems expectable for client credentials flow.li liclientAuthentication is populated and authorizationParameters contains the grant type and clientidli ul  pI suppose I could use the client id from clientAuthentication.authorizationParameters to lookup the user and the details I require, but that would be a few queries each api call which doesnt seem to make sense.p  pI would guess theres a nice placeway in Spring OAuth2 libs that while granting the access token that I could add some extra details so that later I could get them from the OAuth2Authentication principal object or something that extends itp  pAlternatively is there a better approach entirely to such issuep  pThxp

Negative 729 pI am looking to get more control over the validation process of liferay aui components so that i can put in some custom code to handle things such as error event tracking for web analytics.  This question is related to my earlier question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16401634howcanliferayalloyuivalidationerrorbecapturedforwebanalyticshow can liferay alloy ui validation error be captured for web analyticsa.  After some more research i have discovered that custom javascript validators can be implemented using the codeauivalidatorcode tag but what i would need is a way to delegate the validation to the original javascript handle, a kind of a codesupercode call so to speak.  This would ensure that i would be able to leverage all the existing validation functionality existing within aui while being able to add my own logic for analytics.. Admittedly, this is not preferable as i would have to put in this logic in a lot of places in every JSP but at least i will have a solution for what essentially is a critical blocker for me right now.p  pI am keeping this as a separate question as this question is more pointed towards custom validations and a lot of people looking at this even for things other than web analytics would find this useful.p  pLooking forward to some guidance from the community...p

Negative 729 pWe have a 3rd party native application written in C I believe which we want to run multiple instances of on a machine.p  phowever the application reads and writes from one particular registry key in order to find the location of a config file.

The registry key is in HKLM.  this means that if we try and run 2 different instances of the app with 2 different locations for the config file the processes tread on each others toes.  p  pIs it possible to virtualise the registry or run each process in a sandbox that the processes are using so that they can both think they are writing to a single location, but actually they are writing and reading from somewhere different and they wont step on each others toesp

Negative 729 pI have a site with a bar on the left that should stay with the user. So when the user scrolls, the sidebar scrolls along until its lets say 5px from the top of the page. From then on, it should be locked in place there.p  pOf course its possible that the viewport is smaller than the left bar, so the left bar doesnt fully fit in the screen. Not really dramatic though.

Negative 729 pBefore putting my question, I want to quote Expert C Programming [Page 276, last paragraph]p  pThe beauty of Illiffe vector data structre is that it allows arbitrary  arrays of pointers to strings to be passed to functions, but only strongarrays of pointersstrong, and only pointers to strings. This is because both strings and strongpointersstrong have the convention of an explicit outofbound valueNUL and strongNULLstrong, respectively that can be used as an end marker.p  pSo, What I understood from above text is that if there is an array of pointers they have explicit outofbound value like NULL. Correct me , if Im wrong...p  pSo, it left me wondering what are the default values of an array of pointersthinking that an array of pointers would have last pointer as NULL. Tried below codesnippets and result was very different.p  precode    int x[2]     printfp p,x[0],x[1] codepre  pOutput is nil 0x400410p  precode    int x[3]     printfp p p,x[0],x[1],x[2] codepre  pOutput is 0xf0b2ff 0x400680 nilp  precode    int x[4]     printfp p p p, x[0],x[1],x[2],x[3] codepre  pOutput is nil  0x4003db  0x7fffe48e4776   0x4006c5p  pSo, with the above outputs , it is clear that there is an explicit OutofBound nil value assigned to one of the pointersone pointer is NIL, but is it truly the endmarker No.p  pIs it one of those Implementation defined things of Clanguagep  pIm using a GCC compiler4.6.3 on a Ubuntu machine.p

Negative 729 pI am building an ASP.NET site and one of its features is that when a link is clicked, it opens a new tab.  The link is called an ASHX Http Handler that does some process behind the scenes.  What I want is to be able to take the text of the link say for example if a person clicked on a link that says Document 100.txt and have it displayed in the window title of the newly opened ASHX Http Handler.p  pI am currently using  codePage.ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlockthis.GetType, script, ltscriptgtwindow.openHandler.ashxfileName  fileName  ltscriptgt, falsecodep  pThis opens the handler perfectly, only I cannot get the title to display for the new tab.  This would be beneficial because a user can open any number of links at once, and at a glance he or she should be able to differentiate what tab is what based on the window title.p  pI have tried something like  codevar w  window.open... w.document.titlefileNamecode and codevar w  window.open... w.document.writelttitlegt  fileName  lttitlegtcodep  pand none of these work properly since I am writing to the context object in the handler, it would be difficult to write to it to add a title as well.p  pIf anyone has some ideas or suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 729 pI am a developer temporarily tasked with helping the QA team with test automation using JUnit 4 and Selenium WebDriver. I am new to testing and test automation.p  pLooking at various WebDriver examples, a common pattern is to instantiate an implementation of WebDriver like FirefoxWebDriver in the Before method, use the instance in Test method to interface with the browser and driver.quit in After. p  pSo if there are 5 Test methods, the browser will be opened, test app initialized and browser closed 5 times. p  pMy question is why open, initialize and close required for each test case My guess is to prevent one test case failure from having a negative side effect on other tests. Is this correct Are there any other reasonsp

Negative 729 pstrongSolved by Grundy, solution at bottom of poststrongp  pI have a form with a radio option where the elements are selected programmatically and without the user directly clicking on the radio element.p  precodevar elem  input[nametype][valuefoo]  Select the element with name type where the value starts with foo assume only one value is ever found if elem.length gt 0  If element is found then toggle the checked value of the radio value      input[nametype][checkedchecked].attrchecked, false  Uncheck all existing checked items     elem.attrchecked, true  Check the found element from before  codepre  pThis works, I can see the attributes change in Chromes developer tools. The previous checked input is unchecked and the appropriate item becomes checked. This works every time specifically works multiple times Ill explain why thats relevant later.p  pNext I hide all the unchecked radio buttons and show only the checked one.p  precodeinput[nametype]  label.hide input[nametype]checked  label.show codepre  pThis works the first time an input is selected. All the unchecked inputs will be hidden and the checked one will be unhidden. If the input is selected a second time either immediately again or after other options have been selected in between then all of the inputs are hidden including the checked one.p  pIf I check the number of matched elements for codeinput[nametype]checked  labelcode it returns code1code for the first time and code0code for the second time meaning it wont be selected only after the second time. I feel like this is because the codecheckedcode attribute has been changed dynamically at that point but that may not be the cause of the problem.p  pstrongEDIT  Heres a Fiddlestrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJoeyParisYFdPa relnofollowfiddlea Clicking on the gray box will show you its normal behavior when changed by the user clicking on the values.

Negative 729 pI want to know in regards to iOS what is the typical advertising rate for peripherals running in the background.  I know that it will vary depending on what you are doing in the foreground , but I do not know to what degree.

I would like to know between advertising this one packet in the background and nominal iphone usage how likely is it that my advertising rate will still be in the ms rangep  pAlso i have read that i can change this interval programatically, but the examples are only for 30 seconds. im guessing due to limited discoverability mode  Is there a way I could keep recalling this advertising boost strongORstrong Maybe I could start as a central scanning in the background instead and when i scan a certain packet i could switch to peripheral mode since you can only do one or the other in the background and my advertising boost could happen then. Then when that thirty second boost is over i could switch back to central mode until i scan that certain packet again right This way i would only have a small window of poor advertising rate every 30 seconds.

Negative 729 pIm using EF with model first along with SQL Server  today I need to be able to switch to SQLite depending on where my code is running.

Negative 729 pI have a question regarding structuring of code.p  pI have let us say three types of packages A,B and C.p  pNow, classes in package A contains classes which contain the main function. These classes  need some command line arguments to run. p  pIn package B, there are classes which contains some public variables, which need to be configured, at different times.

They do configure their variables as said before. Not only when the object is created, but also at intermediate stage.p  pPackage A also has classes which in turn use classes from package B and package C. In order to configure the variables in classes of B and C, class in package A containing the main function, reads command line arguments and passes the correct values to respective class.p  pNow, given this scenario, I want to use a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgpropercommonscli relnofollowApache Commons CLIa parser.p  pI am unable to understand how exactly I should write my code to be structured in an elegant way.

After doing some research, Im starting to think, that the library Im using JSON.simple might be just too simple . I have found out, that JSONLib can save for example Float and afterwards, read it as a Float thats basically what I want.br Another library which is recommended by a lot of people is Gson, but Im not sure if it would work in my case, since in some cases I would just want to save an array of different map tiles like doors, walls, floor which all have different properties or items and etc., not an object. I hesitate to use another library, since I would have to rewrite some existing code and JSONLib has some dependencies, which I dont really want in my program.br Is there any way for me to stick with JSON.simple without having to typecast all the time Or would you suggest me to switch to another library and if yes, what would you recommendbr Any help would be much appreciated p

Negative 729 pIm a college business student trying to build a website with a business model. I hope this question will serve others in my position who are trying to learn web development and practice business.  Ive spent a lot of time learning trying to find an answer that works so please dont downvote for others in my position.p  pIm building a website where I want to allow users to signup. Right now im using action signup.php to store the user into the database.  After the user is successfully inserted, I redirect the page back to the index.html where the form was submitted.p  pMy Question How can I reference javascript to change the login from displayblock to displaynone and sign up confirmation from displaynone to displayblock through my PHP tagp  pIm currently using GET to grab the successfail status from signup.php and I want to use an IF statement to execute the correct javascript code. p  pEDIT Question Changedp  pI was advised to instead set all divs to block and use a PHP IF statement to display the login or signedup divs. However, after implementing the changes, the index.html still cannot distinguish the successfail status.

The problem is that once they are redirected to the index.html, the php does not recognize the successfail status and consequently only displays the login form.p

Negative 729 pIm new here and my questions is of mathematical rather than programming nature where I would like to get a second opinion on whether my approach makes sense.p  pI was trying to find associations between words in my corpus using the function codefindAssocscode, from the codetmcode package. Even though it appears to perform reasonably well on the data available through the package, such as New York Times and US Congress, I was disappointed with its performance on my own, less tidy dataset. It appears to be prone being distorted by rare document that contain several repetitions of the same words which seems to create a strong association between them. Ive found that the cosine measure gives a better picture of how related the terms are, even though based on literature, it only tends to be used to measure the similarity of documents rather than terms.

This measure tend to be used to find similarity between documents rather than terms, but I see no reason why it cant be used to find similarity between words. In a conventional sense, documents are the vectors while terms are the axes and we can detect their similarity based on the angle between these documents. But a Term Document Matrix is a transpose of a Document Term Matrix, and similarly, we can project terms in the document space, i.e. let your documents be the axes and your terms the vectors between which you can measure the angle.

Negative 729 pIm attempting to setup a project to use disconnected entities and encapsulating my DbContext inside of a Repository class.  Each of the disconnected entities has a local property to track their state remotely and is parsed by the repository when its passed in to set the EntityState property accordingly.p  pMy question is pertaining to updating child objects in the object graph.  Should I set up the repository with update methods that take in commonly updated entities or should I have a single update method for the parent object in the objectgraph and attach  update it.p  pFor Examplep  precodepublic class Company     public int CompanyId  get set     public string CompanyName  get set     public ICollectionltDepartmentgt  get set     public LocalEntityState LocalEntityState  get set    Enum for tracking disconnected changes    public class Department     public int DepartmentId  get set     public int CompanyId  get set     public string DepartmentName  get set     public Company Company  get set     public ICollectionltEmployeegt Employees  get set     public LocalEntityState LocalEntityState  get set      public class Employee     public int EmployeeId  get set     public int DepartmentId  get set     public string FirstName  get set     public string LastName  get set     public Department Department  get set     public LocalEntityState LocalEntityState  get set     codepre  pIf I go with the single method to update the entire object graph for entities that are in the insertedupdated state, I can go with something like the following interface.  One caveat though, is that I need to always have a instance of company and department loaded if Im going to make an update on employee.p  precodepublic interface ICompanyRepository     void InsertOrUpdateCompany company      Other methods for deletion, retrieval, etc..  codepre  pOr I could use something like this where Im providing methods for the primary objects that are changed in the DbContext.  This way I would only have to have an instance of Employee in memory if I wanted to editinsert them.p  precodepublic interface ICompanyRepository     void InsertOrUpdateCompany company    void InsertOrUpdateDepartment department    void InsertOrUpdateEmployee employee  codepre  pI just want to get others thoughts on this and what the best route would be to avoid some common pitfalls.  For my actual project Ive attempted to split the larger DbContext into a smaller subset of Bounded Context From Julie Lermans Entity Framework in the Enterprise so that each repository will be working with a set of related entities.  But Im not sure on the best approach to updating these entities.  Thank you for you help.p

Negative 729 pI developed a FORTRAN code which I compiled with the following commandp  precodeifort g O0 openmp openmpreport threads ipo codepre  pWhen running this code with the above flags, I keep the result with 15 digits when running serial and parallel OpenMP.

Negative 729 pIn a program I was working on, I ran into a data storage issue, specifically related to ArrayLists.  This is not the actual code I was testing, but it provides an example of what I mean.p  precodepublic class test    public static void test        ArrayListltIntegergt bob  new ArrayListltIntegergt     bob.add129     bob.add129     System.out.printlnbob.get0  129      System.out.printlnbob.get1  129      System.out.printlnbob.get0   bob.get1      codepre  pIf you run it, you get, true, true, and false.  The code recognizes that both are equal to 129 but for some reason returns false when it attempts to see if they are equal to each other.  However, if you change the value to 127, it returns true, true, and true.  Testing this multiple times for different values and you will see that the minimum value to receive true, true, and true is 128 and the maximum is 127.  This is the interval for byte, which leads me to suspect that the  operation uses byte in this case.p  pWhat is interesting is that if you modify the code so that it readsp  precodepublic class test    public static void test        ArrayListltIntegergt bob  new ArrayListltIntegergt     bob.add129     bob.add129     int a  bob.get0     int b  bob.get1      System.out.printlna  129      System.out.printlnb  129      System.out.printlna  b      codepre  pit works just as intended.  true, true, and true are outputted.  Why does saving the values as int before the comparison change the outcome  Is it because if they are not saved, the comparison will use byte by default for the  comparisonp

Instead of using the terminal, as the client, you use a web browser. I managed to make the server display Welcome on blahblah, enter your login on the webpage, but then, I dont know how the client can interact with the page, to send info to the server.p  pI imagine Id have to create a HTML page with some forms, to send data. Now, the issue is, how can I send these data to my servers socket  Ideally, I would like to simply send something like ALL to the server, just like a client in the terminal would do, and for the server to send back to the client in this case the web browser the response.p  pSo my goal is to simulate the kind of message the terminal would send, so that I dont have to fully write a second set of commands, and can use the ones already implemented.p  pIve searched the lot, and Im mainly disappointed. The only way I found to do that would be using Websockets in js. The problem is that they use special kind of secured communications, that are absolutely not compatible with my current socket, which is very barebone. What could you advise  How could I, from my HTML page, establish a connexion with the socket, and then send data to the socket  As well as receive them  Of course, no libraries or frameworks are allowed.p

Negative 729 pId like to take the ID of a div that Im applying styling to and set a variable to have that ID as its value. Is this something Sass can do So the selector codeelevencode would set the value of a variable to eleven.p  pHeres the current code. First a mixin that Im usingp  precodemixin lefticon bgcolor, bgurl, iconmargin      background bgcolor urlimagesbgurl.png norepeat left 5px center     amp h2, amp p marginleft iconmargin  codepre  pAnd this is when I call the mixinp  precodeeleven      include lefticonde4c3f,eleven,defaulticonmargin  codepre  pSo when I used that mixin theres a background color, part of a file name, and a value for margins which are added to some child selectors that are set. As you can see the codebgurlcode variable matches the selectors name. Basically I want to automate that so that the codebgurlcode will be set to the text string from the ID with the hash symbol stripped.p  pThe reason being that Im going to have dozens of boxes with the same basic pattern but unique background image and it seems, in my head, the simplest thing to do would be to save each PNG using the ID name as the file name and then let Sass match them up. I could just do as I have done here and put the value in longhand but it seems like something Sass might do so Id rather spend time getting it right and learning more about Sass than do half a job.p  pHope that makes sense and isnt a ridiculously stupid question  I will admit and you wont be surprised to hear that Im a very raw Sass recruit but I figure I can learn from this question.p

Negative 729 pI have designed an application which sometimes needs to make intensive computing inside a loop, that loads cpu heavily during few tenths of seconds. I launch a UIAlertView to display a message, something like please wait for few seconds. My problem is that during this period the App is not responsive at all, and the UIAlertView itself cannot be dismissed by user. This is not a major issue but not fair for the user. But it could become a real problem if I was to implement some kind of cancel button. How can I solve this  For example is there some sleep command that I could use inside my computing loop when detecting too much cpu load  Thanks.p

Negative 729 pBasically Im trying to muck around with SpriteKit, and it took me a while to figure out how to remove a series of SpriteNodes out of an Array. I conquered that, it was an issue of it still being in the ram. Im still trying to figure out some of these strict flags on objc objects. First of all here is my latest stable git commit a hrefhttpsgithub.comkap10gKathySprite relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkap10gKathySpriteap  pRight now Im trying to figure out how to both remove the SKAction from my SKSpriteNode as well as the SKTexture. Setting them to nil does not work as I have been finding. If you download the code you will see that the animation of my walk cycle keeps running as you touch again, the intention is to only have one walk cycle on the screen at a time. The other SKSpriteNodes disappear. Im guessing this is an issue of these SKActions and SKTextures still being in the RAM, but I dont have a clear understanding of how this works. I would love someone to point out the clarity of how this sort of garbage collection works. I will paste my current MyScene.m, as I am working on it now. It is slightly different than the last git update, because I committed it last time I successfully figured something out looping the SKAction.

Negative 729 pI quite like Cs feature of having private, protected and public scopes in classes. I also like the notion of hiding implementation details from library users and preventing library API users from inadvertently messing with delicate internals e.g. by using codeprivatecode scopes, anonymous namespaces.p  pI know that support for this in Python is limited, and that it is source of contention some argue that the only way privacy should be communicated is via a single underscore, codeblacode, whereas others argue that that both single and double underscores should be used, codeblacode for protected and codeblacode for sensitive implementation details see, for example, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1162248601626What is the benefit of private name mangling in Pythona.p  pSo, what Id like to achieve, is to have a few doubleunderscore private members in a module, and then to access those methods from other functions and classes defined in the module scope.p  pAccessing private module members from public module member functions works fine, but it looks like this doesnt work without resorting to name demangling or workarounds from within classes in the modulep  precode usrbinenv python  def func1     print in func1  def func2     print in func2  def func3      will be namemangled due to leading doubleunderscore     print in func3  def publicFunc     print publicFunc start     func3     print publicFunc end  class Foo     def initself         print Foo.init start         func1         func2         func3           Doesnt work, gives          NameError global name Foofunc3 is not defined         print Foo.init end  publicFunc f  Foo codepre  pRunning the above prints thisp  precodepublicFunc start in func3 publicFunc end Foo.init start in func1 in func2 lt... stack tracegt NameError global name Foofunc3 is not defined codepre  pThats not what Id expected  Id assumed functions and classes would have roughly the same behaviour with regards to lexical scope and mangling. Id sort of hoped it would be roughly in line with the concept of private in C, where I can access private detail from classes defined inside the main class, e.g.p  precodeinclude ltcstdiogt  class A  public     class B          public         static void fooB   Afoo       private     static void foo  printfin foon    int mainint argc, char  argv      ABfooB  codepre  pWhich printsp  precodein foo codepre  pId also hoped that it might serve a similar role to that of the anonymous namespace in C, which is really useful when writing implementation details that users of your library should not or must not know about.p  pHere are a few workarounds Ive tried. None of them strike me as particularly elegantp  precodefuncList  [func3] funcList  [func3]  class Foo2     def initself         print Foo.init start         func1         func2          func3           Workaround 1  ugly but OK for globals, but not nonlocals         f3  globals[func3]         f3           Workaround 2  misses the point, because now func3 is          readily accessible without needing to mangle method names.          With my C hat on, this would be roughly equivalent to          returning a pointer to a private member function via          a protected member function.         funcList[0]           Attempt 3  hoping beyond hope that wrapping the method          tag in a private list doesnt work         global funcList         funcList[0]          results in          NameError global name Foo2funcList is not defined         print Foo.init end codepre  pIt seems a shame that implementation details of module classes can not access private members of the module or have I made a mistake somewhere.p  pHere are my questionsp  ol liIs it the case that doubleunderscore is only really intended for preventing masking issues when subclassing If so then I suppose single underscores should be used in all other cases where I want to hide implementation detail.li liIs there a more elegant way of hiding implementation details where they aim is to have both the notion of a protected scope and a private scopeli ol  pThanksp

Negative 729 pI have a UIView slidingView2 that I am sliding onto the the screen. I have set the slidingView2 to be centered on the screen horizontally. When the sliding on the screen happens the view ends up not being in the horizontal center, but rather 10 pixels to the right, partially off screen.p  pBut if I show any other modal view above this screen then close the modal view the slidingView2 is in the center of the screen.p  pThis is built with storyboards and constraints.p  pIts like showing the modal view makes the slidingView2 redraw and then puts it in the correct position  p  pThe other weird thing is the modal screen can be shown at anytime anywhere. What I mean by this is, my slidingView2 is the 2nd view I slide onto the screen. If I show a random modal screen as soon as the app launches then show slidingView1 then slidingView2 then slidingView2 is centered correctly. Or if I remove the modal screen from the app launch and show it after slidingView1 but before slidingView2 then slidingView2 is centered correctly. So as long as any modal screen is shown anytime before slidingView2, then slidingView2 will center correctly.p  pAnyone have any suggestionsp  pEDITp  pMy options at this pointa are to show a transpartent modal view and then take it away i.e. giant ugly hack.p  pOr call some method that makes the view redraw entirely.

If I can make it to decipher it on the paper I think I will have a good enough understanding on how it works and how to call it. p  pAs MSDN points outp  pemThe AesProvider provider is an AES provider that uses a session key encrypted using an RSA key container that has permissions for the IISIUSRS group, therefore allowing IIS worker processes to encrypt and decrypt configuration encrypted with this provider.em p  pSo, the available datap  ul liSession key RSA encrypted from codeltconfigProtectedDatagtcodeli liAES cipher from the same file encAesProvider89v45avZx.....li liMachine RSA key obtained using aspnetregiis px SampleKeys keys.xml pri since useMachineContainer flag is codetruecode.li ul  pIf I understand correctlyp  pIn order to decrypt the password p  pI need to decrypt the RSAEncrypted session key with Machine RSA key. Once I have the decrypted session key I use it as AES key to decrypt the password. Am I mistaken in this thinking p  pIf the above is correct, I will now describe my attemptsp  pUsing Powershell my preferable environmentp  precode    [xml]IISXML  [xml]cat .IISConfigKey.xml [System.Xml.XmlElement]IISElement  IISXML.RSAKeyValue RSA  NewObject System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.RSAKeyValue     RSA.LoadXmlIISElement  Now I have RSAkey loaded as an object from exported XML      AESSessionKey  LIAAAZ..1aVods  Total length 188  I am importing the session key from the file AESProviderSessionKeyBytes  ConvertFromBase64 AESProviderSessionKey.ToCharArray    [byte]   ConvertFromBase64 is my custom function, which basically converts from Base64 to String  codepre  pAnd this seems to be the first culprit I cant get around. Casting codeRSA.Key.DecryptAESProviderSessionKeyBytes, truecode returns an error that the data exceeded 128 bytes. Which happened in fact, as the codeSessionKeyBytescode is of 140length. p  pAs the method I am calling happily throws exceptions at me, I have no idea what to try next. The sessionKey seems too long to be RSAencrypted Or maybe I should divide it Or maybe I am just mistaken in principle that it is RSA encrypted.. I tried couple of versions, but none of them progressed me any closer. p  pHope you can point me in the right directionp

Negative 729 pIm currently working on an asp.net website.  I have a page main.aspx which displays records from a database table. Another page editing.aspx is responsible for editing records in the DB table.p  plets assume we have a scenario where two users are using the website, user1 on session1 is viewing the records in main.aspx, user2 on session2 is editing the DB table from editing.aspx, what I want is to refresh main.aspx for user1 when user2 saves his changes to the DB table.p  pI tried using an AJAX timer that pulls the DB for changes every 10 seconds, and refreshes an UpdatePanel in which Im displaying the records, and it works just fine, but I want to know if therese a better way than pulling the DB server for changes.p  pthanks.p
Negative 729 pI am writing a component that involves Actions and came upon a requirement to find a way to identify using reflection cases when the Action.Target object is a closure that the compiler have generated. I am doing an experiment to try and find a way, the purpose of this little experiment is to develop a predicate that takes an Action and returns a bool that tells if the action target is an instance of such closure class.p  pIn my test case, I have the following methods that create 4 different types of actionsp  precode    private void createClosureint i              ClosureAction  new Action gt                      var j  i             var k  somenum                    private void createLambda              LambdaAction  new Action gt                      this.instanceAction                     private void createInstance              InstanceAction  new ActioninstanceAction           private void createStatic              StaticAction  new ActionstaticAction           private int somenum      private void instanceAction              somenum           private static void staticAction            codepre  pThe following table shows the properties of each action img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7NtHj.png altAction propertiesp  pAs you see, LambaAction and ClosureAction are quite similar in terms of defnition, they both use lambda, but the closure one has a local function variable that is being used inside the lambda, and therefore the compiler is forced into generating a closure class. Its clear that the second row, the one that presents ClosureAction, is the only one that has a target that is a closure type. The static one does not have a target at all, and the other two use the calling class Called ActionReferences as target. The next table presents a comparison of the target reflection type properties img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrGI0B.png altTarget Typesp  pSo we can see that whats unique about the closure case is that the target type is note a type info but rather a nested type. Its also the only one that is private nested, sealed and has a name that contains the string ltcDisplayClass. Now while I think that these characteristics are conclusive for any normal usage case, I would prefer to define a predicate that I can rely on. I dont like to base this mechanism on compilers naming conventions or properties that are not unique because technically, the user may create a private nested sealed class with the same naming convention... its not likely, but its not 100 clean solution.p  pstrongSo finally  the question is this Is there a clean cut way to write a predicate the identifies actions that are actually compiler generated closuresstrongp  pThanksp
Negative 729 pI seem to be caught between two design guidelines.p  pI have a class that represents a threedimensional volume, that is made of blocks. This class provides simple modification methods, such as emAddBlockem or emRemoveBlockem.p  pThere are several things I need to do with this classp  pFirst, i need to know certain aggregate properties about the volume, with methods such as emGetTotalWeightem or emGetMaximumWidthem.p  pSecond, i need to perform transformation operations over this volumes, such as emShrinkem or emTrimem, which do pretty much what the names tell you no need to go into detail, volumes just change according to some rules, by adding or removing blocks. These operations have lots of logic in them.p  pMy question is If I add these query and transformation methods to the emVolumeem class, does this break the strongsingle responsibility principlestrong My classes responsibilities would bep  ul liHold the volume data, allowing simple modifications add and remove blocksli liProvide aggregate information about the volumeli liProvide transform capabilities for these volumes.li ul  pIf I decide this is too much responsibility, and that the emVolumeem class should just represent the volume, I would need to create classes such as emVolumeTrimmerem, emVolumeShrinkerem, and so on, for the transformations, and emWeightCalculatorem for the queriesp  pThis last option seems to neatly separate the concerns in different classes. However, if I look at the details of the emTrimVolume vem of my emVolumeTrimmerem, all it does is call operations over volume. At the same time, the emCalculateWeightVolume vem method of my emWeightCalculatorem seems to be mostly concerned with emVolumeem.p  pWhen I look at this kind of method, I feel compelled to use the strongMove Methodstrong refactoring. I look at the code and say this method is mostly concerned with the properties of another class, therefore i better move this method to this class. But this brings the responsibility back to the emVolumeem classp  pAny ideas on how should I approach this problem Am I understanding these guidelines wrongp

Resulting in any users already signed up being treated as a new user, Is there a way I can migrate the provider key or tell owin what provider key to use.

Negative 729 pI recently started playing around with Java FX, FXML, and scene builder, and Ive been trying to add key listeners to one of the controllers for a scene. When I do this though, the key listeners dont work as they should, and I figure its because theyre not focused onto that particular scene. I tried to get access to the scene the controller was part of in order to set it directly, but it comes up that its part of a null scene.p  pIs there a way to gain access to the scene that this controller is used in in order to try and assign key event and listeners to that particular scene Should I go through the rootController which is static throughout the whole application Or, better yet, is there a simpler way of going about this p  pMost examples I see assume that everything is mostly together in a main class or separated amongst a couple of other classes without FXML being brought in, and Im not sure how to apply their fixes when I have the java controllers, FXML pages, and the main application all separated.p  pThanks for any help p

Negative 729 pIm doing a model at the moment which I need to adjust in quite a big way. Basically I need to extend my current set V which is a set of cities to become a set of cities and time. For instance, the element Kir in V must be extended from simply Kir to Kir1, Kir2,...,Kir72 to represent the city Kir as well as the time frame specified by the number. p  pIve started to define this as in the .mod file      set V      set K within Vp  pand in the .dat file Im quite unsure of how to write this. If there is no simple way of including the string Kir in the set K, Ill guess Im going to writep  precodeset V  1 2 3 4 5 set K  1 2 codepre  pfor instance. My question is how do I do this Can I include the city name Kir And specifically Ive defined a pivot table of distances between the cities in the original V set. The distances in the original set V between, say, the cities Kir and Sto must be the same as the distance between Kir1 and Sto1 in the extended set. It must also be the same distance between Kir1 and Sto72. The original distance must be the same that is, independent of which time frame it is. Is there a simple way of doing this within AMPLp  pEDIT Added the tag Python. I would guess this can be achieved in Python as well. Ive managed to define the new sets, usingp  precodetext  Kir string2  [i for i in range1,49] for i in string2     print textstri codepre  pfor instance. Im stuck in regards to the distance matrix thoughp

Negative 729 pI have a very large repository with one branch. Its working tree is constantly being updated every few seconds and committed every few minutes.p  pMy emactualem goal here is to run codegit subtree splitcode for a particular directory and truncate most of the repository after moving that directory to a save location. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions359424detachsubdirectoryintoseparategitrepository1786447517864475Detach subdirectory into separate Git repositorya However, this fails because one of the commits has an empty codeidentcode.p  pSo, I proceeded to try to remove this commit. But the only way to do this that Ive found so far is coderebasecode. However, not only would this take forever on my repository, but I would need to stop the constant updates to the working tree during the process, which may not be possible or ideal.p  pGiven my understanding of the way that commits are represented internally, I would think it would be a simple matter to just eliminate the commit from history and switch the links of the neighboring commits.

My Key and Password are working fine using JAVA with PUT yet I need a solution that works on the client side. Other schemes without the SDK used other means to sign the URL but I could not get those to work here either I could really use some help.

Negative 729 pIm creating an angular application based on the JHipster yeoman generator. The application is in two parts. One is a minimal requirements js with templates for loading the login screen and resources nescessary to log in to the application. The other is the application itself.p  pMy problem is that my index.html is static and can therefore only invoke loading the beforelogon.js. After logon, I need the exact same structure in my index.html except it should point to afterlogon.js.p  pIm thinking that this could be easily solved by renaming my index.html to index.jsp, and setting up a conditional ifelse before the insertion of the script tag.

Negative 729 pI am working with an ASPX web application. Basically there is a page that has 2 forms that have almost all of the same from inputs. I would like for a way to have a checkbox that once its clicked, it would call some javascript code or whatever you guys suggest, it has to be client side only though to autofill the second form with the inputted information from the first form. Keep in mind not all form inputs match on both forms. p  pReally all Im trying to do is exactly what some websites do when you purchase something and you have to input your shipping address as well as your billing address, then it asks if your billing address is the same as your shipping address next to a checkbox, and once the checkbox is clicked, the billing address form gets autofilled with the information from the shipping address form. p  pThis is all done from the same page, so it should be simple. I am not good with javascript, but I dont mind doing it with it. p

Negative 729 pI wrote a simple genetic algorithm using one point crossover, one point mutation, and tournament selection to solve the one max problem for 64 bits. The size of the population is 100. I wanted to see the influence of the crossover operator on the result. So I run the algorithm on a 0 probability for mutation 20 times, and took the mean of the best results, per iteration of the algorithm. I repeated this 5 times changing the probability of using the crossover operator acording to this formula pcrossover  1  0.95n1, n is the number of test. The results surprised me a bit. I know the rule of thumb is to set the crossover probability relativly high to fully exploit the information in the population. But why doesnt it affect the result linearly The first 3 test gave very similar mean results 61.5 prob  1, 61.5 prob  0.95, 61.35 prob  0.9025, then the las two  60.45prob  0.8574, 60.5 prob  0.8145. Can somebody explain this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWSJXK.png altpicture showing the 5 tests of the algorithmp  pEditI took a second attempt running the algorithm not 20 but 50 times. Now the mean results look like this, so it seems as if outliers caused this behaviour.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG83wT.png altenter image description herep
Negative 729 pI dont understand what is going on in my SAS code. The code behaves as expected, but only during the first time it compiles, i.e. the table called SummaryTable shows the correct LogLik value for each of the 3 iterations where the code triggers mylogreg and ModelsSummary. However, if I rerun the code then it behaves differently, the LogLik value for the 3 iterations is the same and it is equal to the value for the last iteration. So, in some way the variable MyLogLik saved the value of the third iteration during the first time the code is compiled.p  pFist data generation stepp  precodedata ingots input heat soak r n  datalines 7 1.0 0 10   7 1.7 0 17   7 2.2 0  7   7 2.8 0 12   7 4.0 0  9 14 1.0 0 31  14 1.7 0 43  14 2.2 2 33  14 2.8 0 31  14 4.0 0 19 27 1.0 1 56  27 1.7 4 44  27 2.2 0 21  27 2.8 1 22  27 4.0 1 16 51 1.0 3 13  51 1.7 0  1  51 2.2 0  1  51 2.8 0  1  run codepre  pThen the macrosp  precodemacro mylogregNum,param     title variables are ampparam    proc logistic dataingots des outest  parametersampNum noprint model rn  ampparam run  mend  macro ModelsSummaryCount,Var,Param    proc sql     select LNLIKE intoMyLogLik from parametersampCount     insert into SummaryTable ModelNumber,ModelVariables,NumParameters, LogLik values ampCount,ampVar,ampParam, ampMyLogLik     drop table parametersampCount      quit mend codepre  pThen my codep  precodeproc sql    create table SummaryTable                       ModelNumber num,                       ModelVariables varchar 500,                       NumParameters num,                       LogLik num                                                                                    quit  data NULL   array a[2]   heat  soak  length temp 500    Number of Variables   n  dima    k tell us the number of variables in aech group of all possible conbination   do k1 to n  total tells the number of different convinations given that we form groups of k variables  total  combn,k  do j1 to total      allcomb is the SAS function which forms all different combinations      call allcombj,k,of a[]     This counter show the total number of convinations for all ks     Counter  1      do i  1 to k         if i  1 then temp           this temp string contains the explanatory variables to be passed to the logistic reg         tempcatttemp,a[i]     end       NumParam shows the number of parameters in the logistic model, including the intercept     NumParam  k  1       First we call the logistic regression macro, and the we fill out the table summarizing the important results     call executemylogregCounter,temp     call executeModelsSummaryCounter,temp,NumParam     end   end  run codepre  pThen the problem is that if I rerun the code, then the values for LogLik in SummaryTable will all be the same, and the value corresponds to the third model.

I have checked that ModelSummary is getting passed the correct values for the variable Counter this can also be confirmed in the SQL output, and it seems correct.

Negative 729 pSo I know about setSurface, and have no problem using it as an overlay or whatever   its on a surfacecontrol.  That said, I am stumped about getting pixel datap  p1 Ive tried everything I can think of the control, the root, etc to use the drawing cache functions to get the bits for the camera surface.  Yah, no.  The cached bitmap is always zerod out.p  p2 Ive used both SurfaceView and GLSurfaceView successfully as a setSurface taget. I cannot use any other class, such as TextureView. p  p3 Ive investigated the C API and I see the camera exposes connectOnFrameAvailable, which will give me access to the pixelsp  pMy guess is that the internal tango logic is just using the surface in java to gain access to the underlying bit transfer channel   in the C API it requires a texture ID, which makes me suspect at the end of the day, the camera data is shipped in to the GPU pretty quickly, and I bet that CUDA lib operates on it  given the state of things, I cant see how to get the bits on the Java side without rooting the device  just cause I have a texture or simple surface view rendering raw bits on the screen doesnt mean I can get to them.p  pI dont want to peel the image data back out of the GPU.  Id need to switch my busy animation from a watch to a calendar for that.p  pBefore I dive down into the C API, is there any way I can get the camera bits in Java   I really want to be able to associate them with a specific pose, but right now I cant even figure out how to get them at all.  I really want to know the location and color of a 3D point.  Camera intrinsics, the point cloud, and the 2d image that generated the point cloud are all I need.  But I cant do anything if I cant get the pixels, and the more questionable the relationship between an image and a pose and a pointcloud the sketchier any efforts will become.p  pIf I do dive into C, will the connectOnFrameAvailable give me what I need   How well synced is it with the point cloud generation   Oh, and have I got this right  Color camera is used for depth, fisheye is used for pose p  pCan I mix Java and C, i.e. create a Tango instance in Java and then just use C for the image issue   Or am I going to have to rerealize everything in C and stop using the tango java jar p

Negative 729 pIm trying to update a registry value in a Windows CE  Compact Framework app.p  pI can do what I want in .NET 4.5, but .NET 3.5 is missing some of the pieces to do it that way specifically emRegistryViewem and emOpenBaseKeyem the curious can peruse all the gory details a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28077683howcaniupdatetheregistryusingnet35cfherea.p  pAnother possibility is to ship a .reg file with the app and invoke it via ShellExecuteEx, but that seems a bit Rubegoldbergish to me. p  pYet another possibility is to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa446536.aspx relnofollowuse PInvokea, but that seems like modified Hobbesianism nasty and brutish, but not short short would be good in this case.p  pSO...I emdidem finally find something that seems like an almost eurekaphoric option. According to Andy Wigly in his book emMicrosoft .NET Compact Frameworkem printed 1879 or so, you can add or manipulate registry values via a configuration file. This config file seems to be embedded in athe cab when the app is deployed on the device. Quoting from the bookp  precodeAddReg  Defines the name of the section of the configuration file for adding entries to the registry ... p. 211 codepre  pandp  precodeDescription of the AddReg Section The AddReg sections are optional sections of the configuration file. These sections are defined by the AddReg key under the DefaultInstall section of the configuration file. Each section defines the registry keys, and values are added to the registry when your application is installed. For more information, see the devices SDK p. 213 codepre  pBut emwhatem configuration file is here being so cavalierly bandied about I cant locate where he backs up and gives fundamental info about it.p  pOkay, I can try to locate the devices SDK they are Motorola 30903190 devices onto which this app is installed but am hoping that somebody knows just which configuration file hes talking about, and what the needed entry looks like.p  pWe have a separate install app for this app, and I searched it for AddReg and DefaultInstall, but to no avail.p  pIm thinking that the file probably has to have a specific name for the cab to know what it is and run it .config and that the entry might be something likep  precode[DefaultInstall] [AddReg] GuestOnly00000001 codepre  p...but I dont really know, thats just a guess. Does anybody know what this entry is supposed to look like It sure would be a much simpler way of changing the registry val than PInvoke and the like.p  pIts not the .vcproj file, is it the setup app is written in C the app itself is C.p  h2UPDATEh2  pIt turns out I may be a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28095837howcanideterminewhichregistrysettinggetsupdatedwhentheuserselectsfbarking up the wrong treea with this attempt to update the GuestOnly setting.p  h2UPDATE 2h2  pAt any rate, it cant hurt and emmayem help to updated that value so, I looked through our C install app, but it contains no .inf files, nor any reference to such, so I guess the best or only real way to do this is by adding the registry updating code to the app itself. I call it from the main forms Load event.p

Negative 729 pI have installed the plugins Easy Smooth Scroll Links ESSL and Page Scroll to ID for wordpress however neither of them seem to work on webkit browsers. I have done some research and have found at least one viable solution but the plugin files are in minified form, so its almost impossible for me to modify them without spending hours reformatting there is also the fact that a majority of the code looks to be too advanced for me to understand.p  pIf it is any help the site I am working on is a hrefhttpdesign.mindgarden.me relnofollowhttpdesign.mindgarden.mea and the section in question is the circledown arrow button. Upon clickingpressing it, it should scroll the page down to the services section. Works fine on Firefox, IE and presumably other nonwebkit browsers but not on Chrome, Safari, etc.p  pAnyway the main answer I am trying to get to here is if this is a well known enough issue if there is any known work aroundfix or if there is an alternative plugin with the same functionality that you know of which works on webkit browsers.p  pI have already submitted a support ticket modernthemes creator of the theme I am using as I had previously thought it was an issue on their side however seeing as we are in different hemispheres I figured I would try to reach out to a wider audience. I have also checked the support forums for each plugin I mentioned, however there was no such topic posted and they seemed pretty inactive...  also a search on wordpress for similar plugins only revealed hundreds of scroll to top clones which is not what I am looking for at the moment. And now that I think about it, I may as well post a thread about this on the official wordpress support forums...p  pThank you in advance.p  pPs. It says I need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links, so you will have to google for the plugins yourself.p

Negative 729 pThought there might be a simple solution to this, but I cant seem to find it anywhere.  Its a simpleenough problem.

My expectation is that it would return text2.txt.  Any thoughts  I have already checked to see if I have any wayward aliases assigned to find, and I have nothing.p  pIt is also worth it to note that I have two unix machines.  The use of an absolute path for find works on one machine and not the other.  Cant go into much more detail than that, Im afraid.  Just looking for a direction to investigate this more.p  pThanks to anyone who can help p

Negative 729 pI took a TodoList example to reflect my problem but obviously my realworld code is more complex.p  pI have some pseudocode like this.p  precodevar Todo  React.createClass   mixins [PureRenderMixin],    ............    var TodosContainer  React.createClass   mixins [PureRenderMixin],        renderTodo functiontodo       return ltTodo keytodo.id todoDatatodo xthis.props.x ythis.props.y ...gt   ,    render function       var todos  this.props.todos.mapthis.renderTodo      return            ltReactCSSTransitionGroup transitionNametransitiontodogt                  todos           ltReactCSSTransitionGroupgt,            codepre  pAll my data is immutable, and PureRenderMixin is used appropriately and everything works fine. When a Todo data is modified, only the parent and the edited todo is rerendered.p  pThe problem is that at some point my list grows big as the user is scrolling. And when a single Todo is updated, it takes more and more time to render the parent, call codeshouldComponentUpdatecode on all the todos, and then render the single todo.p  pAs you can see, the Todo component has other component than the Todo data. This is data that is required for render by all the todos and is shared for example we could imagine theres a displayMode for the todos. Having many properties makes the codeshouldComponentUpdatecode perform a little bit slower. p  pAlso, using codeReactCSSTransitionGroupcode seems to slow down a little too, as codeReactCSSTransitionGroupcode have to render itself and  codeReactCSSTransitionGroupChildcode even before the codeshouldComponentUpdatecode of todos is called. codeReact.addons.Perfcode shows that codeReactCSSTransitionGroup gt ReactCSSTransitionGroupChildcode rendering is time wasted for each item of the list.p  pSo, as far as I know, I use codePureRenderMixincode but with a larger list this may be not enough. I still get not so bad performances, but would like to know if there are easy ways to optimize my renderings.p  pAny ideap  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pSo far, my big list is paginated, so instead of having a big list of items, I now split this big list in a list of pages. This permits to have better performances as each page can now implement codeshouldComponentUpdatecode. Now when an item changes in a page, React only has to call the main render function that iterates on the page, and only call the render function from a single page, which make a lot less iteration work.p  pHowever, my render performance is still linear to the page number On I have. So if I have thousands of pages its still the same issue  In my usecase its unlikely to happen but Im still interested in a better solution.p  pI am pretty sure it is possible to achieve Ologn rendering performance where n is the number of items or pages, by splitting a large list into a tree like a persistent data structure, and where each node has the power to shortcircuit the computation with codeshouldComponentUpdatecode p  pYes Im thinking of something akin to persistent data structures like Vector in Scala or Clojurep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNc2Tk.png althttphypirion.comimgspvec9annotated.pngp  pHowever Im concerned about React because as far as I know it may have to create intermediate dom nodes when rendering the internal nodes of the tree. This may be a problem according to the usecase a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookreactissues2127and may be solved in future versions of Reactap  pAlso as we are using Javascript I wonder if ImmutableJS support this, and make the internal nodes accessible. See a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookimmutablejsissues541httpsgithub.comfacebookimmutablejsissues541ap

Negative 729 pIs there a way to sync multiple ES clusters with each other The ES docs discourage from having a cluster spanning multiple data centers. So to avoid that Id be having distinct ES clusters in each datacenter. I also need to have the same data indexed in each cluster. p  pOne way to achieve that would be to send each document to each cluster. But issuing n write requests seems unnecessary. Additionally, if some write requests fail, the clusters could potentially go out of sync.p  pIs there a way for a cluster to subscribe to changes in another cluster Or send the writes to a master cluster whichever one is the closest to the data source and let it eventually replicate to the other onesp  pedit Ive read about tribe nodes. The docs say that it works just for reads and has some limitations. Is that something that would let me do thisp

Negative 729 pWe are using the  codeTYPELINEARACCELERATIONcode codeTYPEGRAVITYcode sensor event values for our wearable application but for sony smartwatch 3 our app cannot provide compatibility because of the lack of these two sensorp  pthe official docs saysp  blockquote   pThe Android Open Source Project AOSP provides three softwarebased   motion sensors a gravity sensor, a linear acceleration sensor, and a   rotation vector sensor. These sensors were updated in Android 4.0 and   now use a devices gyroscope in addition to other sensors to improve   stability and performance. If you want to try these sensors, you can   identify them by using the getVendor method and the getVersion   method the vendor is Google Inc. the version number is 3.   Identifying these sensors by vendor and version number is necessary   because the Android system considers these three sensors to be   secondary sensors. For example, if a device manufacturer provides   their own gravity sensor, then the AOSP gravity sensor shows up as a   secondary gravity sensor. All three of these sensors rely on a   gyroscope if a device does not have a gyroscope, these sensors do not   show up and are not available for use.p blockquote  pSo my question is if the OEM doesnt provide the primary support for these three soft based sensor then is there a way of using the AOSP one. i didnt understand how to use them as mentioned in the docs it just says to use getVendor getversion it only checks who is the vendor and what is the version. Other approach would be using of filters for getting these gravity and linear acceleration values from gyroscope values but i dont know how exactly to do that and what are the caveats of using it.p  pPS. LG G WATCH and Moto 360 do provide these sensor,also i checked the vendor from the getVendor method its EM Micro for Sony and Invensense for G watch. no Google Inc in G watch alsop

Negative 729 h1Backgroundh1  pA customer asked me to find out why their C application well call it XXX, delivered by a consultant who has fled the scene is so flaky, and fix it. The application controls a measurement device over a serial connection. Sometimes the device delivers continuous readings which are displayed on screen, and sometimes the app needs to stop continuous measurements and go into commandresponse mode.p  h1How emNOTem to do ith1  pFor continuous measurements, XXX uses codeSystem.Timers.Timercode for background processing of serial input. When the timer fires, C runs the timers codeElapsedEventHandlercode using some thread from its pool. XXXs event handler uses a blocking codecommPort.ReadLinecode with a several second timeout, then calls back to a delegate when a useful measurement arrives on the serial port. This portion works fine, however...p  pWhen its time to stop realtime measurements and command the device to do something different, the application tries to suspend background processing from the GUI thread by setting the timers codeEnabled  falsecode. Of course, that just sets a flag preventing further events, and a background thread already waiting for serial input continues waiting. The GUI thread then sends a command to the device, and tries to read the reply  but the reply is received by the background thread. Now the background thread becomes confused as its not the expected measurement. The GUI thread meanwhile becomes confused as it didnt receive the command reply expected. Now we know why XXX is so flaky.p  h1Possible Method 1h1  pIn another similar application, I used a codeSystem.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorkercode thread for freerunning measurements. To suspend background processing I did two things in the GUI threadp  ol licall the codeCancelAsynccode method on the thread, andli licall codecommPort.DiscardInBuffercode, which causes a pending blocked, waiting comport read in the background thread to throw a codeSystem.IO.IOException The IO operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request.rncode. li ol  pIn the background thread I catch this exception and clean up promptly, and all works as intended. Unfortunately codeDiscardInBuffercode provoking the exception in another threads blocking read is not documented behavior anywhere I can find, and I hate relying on undocumented behavior. It works because internally codeDiscardInBuffercode calls the Win32 API PurgeComm, which interrupts the blocking read documented behavior.p  h1Possible Method 2h1  pDirectly use the codeBaseClass Stream.ReadAsynccode method, with a monitor cancellation token, using a supported way of interrupting the background IO. p  pBecause the number of characters to be received is variable terminated by a newline, and no codeReadAsyncLinecode method exists in the framework, I dont know if this is possible. I could process each character individually but would take a performance hit might not work on slow machines, unless of course the linetermination bit is already implemented in C within the framework.p  h1Possible Method 3h1  pCreate a lock Ive got the serial port. Nobody reads, writes, or discards input from the port unless they have the lock including repeating the blocking read in background thread. Chop the timeout values in the background thread to 14 second for acceptable GUI responsiveness without too much overhead.p  h1Questionh1  pDoes anybody have a proven solution to deal with this problem How can one cleanly stop background processing of the serial port Ive googled and read dozens of articles bemoaning the C codeSerialPortcode class, but havent found a good solution.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 729 pIm using session variables to store objects by assigning them to a corresponding session key. Because these variables are sessionspecific they arent collected by Garbage Collector, but rather cleared by session timeout. In order to delete these session variables I must remove the key that holds the object I dont want to use anymore.p  pWhen assigning an object to a session variable, Does that session key points to the object reference itself or does it create another referencep  pAnd when a session key that holds an object is removed by using .Remove, Does this removal clears that memory space or does it still exist under the hood but without a related keyp  pIm asking this because I want to know if server performance is affected when using several session variablese.g. big objects in session and many users, to know if removing the keys of the objects that are not going to be used anymore causes a benefit in server memory usage, and also to know what happens under the hood when these keys are removed.p
