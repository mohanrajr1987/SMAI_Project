Positive 1602 pi am creating a user login page. as user Enter hisher emailid and click ok button . control goes to database.jsp class where it check that use is authenticate user or not if user is valid use than only otp generate and send to the same email id which is Enter by the user. after that user enter otp number.but i want to check otp enter by the user is valid or not.so for that i m using validation function on click submit button .  i m saving the otp generate in database.jsp inside the session object but the problem is that session is not refreshing because of the ajax so i m

Negative 1602 pI find that for most software projects, documentation is often oriented towards the process of development the software, rather than supporting and maintaining it. This is particularly true when using agile methodologies, which emphasize minimalistic documentation.p  pThe issue with developmentoriented documentation is that it tends to be less usable as a reference, especially after a few releases. Its a pain to sifting through a pile of story cards or story pages on a wiki, as our team uses trying to work out which stories are current, and which have been modified directly or indirectly by more recent stories. A full waterfallstyle requirements specification, technicaldesign document, etc. may be fine if development is always done in a big bang, but as bugs are fixed, minor features added, etc. it may be difficult to maintain.p  pIm a fan of minimalistic documentation, as the less documentation there is, the easier it is to find things assuming what youre looking for is documented, of course, and the easier it is to maintain. p  pI am thinking of extending our wikibased story pages to contain some metadata, i.e. references to other stories which are related, affected, obsoleted, etc., similar to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRequestforComments relnofollowIETF RFPsa.p  pIm interested in hearing about other peoples experiences with lightweight approaches to software documentation that works for maintenance and support, not just delivering a project and tossing it over the wall.p  pemUpdateem I dont consider classlevel documentation to be enough, whether using inline documentation such as javadoc or unit tests as documentation. These are fine for developers, but testers, support staff, trainers and the like need a way to understand what the expected behavior of the code is. This needs a higher level view of functionality than classbyclass. Each class may be doing what it was meant to do, but is how is the component as a whole supposed to work This is why I personally favor the user story as a basic unit of documentation.p

Negative 1602 pI am using multiple child models in a complex form a la a hrefhttprailsforum.comviewtopic.phpid28447 relnofollowhttprailsforum.comviewtopic.phpid28447a. The form works great, but I need to validate a property of the emsetem of child models before accepting the form data into the database. Ive come up with one mostlyworking, verykludgy way of doing this. Seems like there has to be a better way, so Im asking for suggestions...p  pBasically a Person hasmany Distributions. The Distribution has among other things a percentage attribute. For a given person, their distributions must total 100 to be valid. This screams transaction to me, but I figured I should give the validators a shot first.p  pI tried writing this as a custom validator, but the validator only works on data already saved to the database. It did not check the parameters submitted by the form. In other words I was able to enter invalid percentages via the form, which were saved, and then subsequent edits all failed because of the bad data already in the model.p  pNext I extended updateattributes in my Person model, adding a transactionp  precodedef updateattributesparams   retval  true   self.transaction do     retval  super      unless distributionsexactly100       retval  false       errors.addtobaseDistribution must add up to exactly 100       raise ActiveRecordRollback     end   end   retval end codepre  pThe retval business is ugly but this more or less works sometimes some of the pending distributions are missing from the form, when it finds an error and rerenders. There is an additional nuance that convinces me this is a poor approach if my distirbutions association is defined with helper methods, as below, I cant use the helper methods in my codeupdateattributescode or in codedistributionsexactly100code, because they go to the database rather than operating on the set of justassignedbutnotyetcommitted distributions.p  precode hasmany distributions do    def formonthandyearmonth, year      find all, conditions gt [month   and year  , month, year]    end     def totalformonthandyearmonth, year      sum percentage, conditions gt [month   and year  , month, year]    end     ...     def yearsandmonths      ds  findall, order gt year DESC, month DESC      ds.collect d [d.year, d.month].uniq    end   end codepre  pThe only other thing I can think of is to process the params themselves, as text, on the way into updateattributes. But that is just Wrong. p  pAnyone else doing validation on a whole collection of children Whats the right way to go about itp

Negative 1602 pIm trying to write a simple stock check program, and I have a Table View binded to Core Data. The table has 3 columns Model, Price and Quantity In Stock.p  pI have a NSTextField and a NSButton underneath this, so that the user can enter the quantity they wish to buy, and when they click add to cart, the program should fetch the value in the quantity in stock column, in the selected row, and deduct the value entered into the NSTextField, obviously, it would return an error is there isnt enough in stock. At the same time, the whole row, model, price and quantity desired should be added to an invoice.p  pMy question is this How would I go about retrieving the value in the quantity field at the selected row, manipulating it, and reinserting it into the tablep  pOr would I have to edit the Core Data directly And how would I go about thatp  pMany thanks, Michaelp

Negative 1602 pBasically something that handles the lowlevel plumbing code for a subscriptionbased service.  I see a lot of things dealing with basic membership, but nothing that handles the subscription aspect recurring billing, automated jobs for setting up billing, notification for billing, etc.  This might be the one thing that keeps me from using ASP.NET MVC for my SaaS idea, since it would take a fair amount of development time to write my own if I go with my other option, Ruby on Rails, I can buy a a hrefhttprailskits.comsaaskit that does all of this for 250a.  I havent found anything even remotely close to this for .NET  all of the SaaS sample apps Ive seen are more like StackOverflow et all where you have one site that multiple people log on to, not the web application model where you have subscribers who are billed monthly, each of whom has users and other entities e.g. Customers, Tasks, etc for their own site.p  pIs there anything similar for ASP.NET, or some kind of guidelines for writing my own if I have to, so I dont waste too much time  As a startup that means that Im doing all the coding myself.p  pIve found a hrefhttpdotnetmerchant.orgthisa, but it seems to only be for billing and didnt seem to have much any documentation on exactly how to set it up.p

Negative 1602 pIve got a project where well need to generate a lot of fixedlength random codes Read Millions from a set of characters EG 12 digit alphanumeric or 9 digit alphanumeric lowercase only without the l character. Were going to then store these codes in an MSSQL database SQL Server 2008. The language were using is C.p  pWe also need to be able to generate more codes and add them to an existing set of codes with them being unique against themselves and the existing codes. The quantity of random codes generated will likely vary from millions down to merely hundreds.p  pThe two obvious approaches that come to mind is either to generate codes and just throw them at the database catching unique constraint exceptions or to pull the data down locally into a hash table then calculate all the new codes locally and put them into the database once generated.p  pDoes anyone have any idea which of the above solutions would be more optimal or even better another solution thats more efficient that I havent thought ofp  h2Clarificationsh2  pThe codes generated have to be nonpredictable and therell be multiple batches, each with uniqueness within themselves EG Wed have code set A with 100000 unique codes, code set B with 100000 unique codes, but thered be no restriction that A intersect B is empty. They also have to be easy for a human to use Hence the short length and potentially restricted character sets to avoid ambiguous characters.p  pThe codes will be sent to users via various methods Email, SMS, printed on paper, etc and are used in a 1use manner later So if someone guesses someone elses code itd be bad.p

Negative 1602 pI recently launched a rocket with a barometric altimeter that is accurate to roughly 10 ft calculated via data acquired during flight.  The recorded data is in time increments of 0.05 sec per sample and a graph of altitude vs. time looks pretty much like it should when zoomed out over the entire flight.p  pThe problem is when I try to calculate other values such as velocity or acceleration from the data, the accuracy of the measurements makes the calculated values pretty much worthless.  What techniques can I use to smooth out the data so that I can calculate or approximate reasonable values for the velocity and acceleration  It is important that major events remain in place in time, most notably the 0 for for the first entry and the highest point during flight 2707.p  pThe altitude data follows and is measured in ft above ground level.  The first time would be 0.00 and each sample is 0.05 seconds after the previous sample.  The spike at the beginning of the flight is due to a technical problem that occurred during liftoff and removing the spike is optimal.p  pI originally tried using linear interpolation, averaging nearby data points, but it took many iterations to smooth the data enough for integration and the flattening of the curve removed the important apogee and ground level events.  p  pAll help is greatly appreciated.  Please note this is not the complete data set and I am looking for suggestions on better ways to analyze the data, not for someone to reply with a transformed data set.  It would be nice to use an algorithm on board future rockets which can predict current altitudevelocityacceleration without knowing the full flight data, though that is not required.p  precode00000 00000 00000 00076 00229 00095 00057 00038 00048 00057 00057 00076 00086 00095 00105 00114 00124 00133 00152 00152 00171 00190 00200 00219 00229 00248 00267 00277 00286 00305 00334 00343 00363 00363 00382 00382 00401 00420 00440 00459 00469 00488 00517 00527 00546 00565 00585 00613 00633 00652 00671 00691 00710 00729 00759 00778 00798 00817 00837 00856 00885 00904 00924 00944 00963 00983 01002 01022 01041 01061 01080 01100 01120 01139 01149 01169 01179 01198 01218 01238 01257 01277 01297 01317 01327 01346 01356 01376 01396 01415 01425 01445 01465 01475 01495 01515 01525 01545 01554 01574 01594 01614 01614 01634 01654 01664 01674 01694 01714 01724 01734 01754 01764 01774 01794 01804 01814 01834 01844 01854 01874 01884 01894 01914 01924 01934 01954 01954 01975 01995 01995 02015 02015 02035 02045 02055 02075 02075 02096 02096 02116 02126 02136 02146 02156 02167 02177 02187 02197 02207 02217 02227 02237 02237 02258 02268 02278 02278 02298 02298 02319 02319 02319 02339 02349 02359 02359 02370 02380 02380 02400 02400 01914 02319 02420 02482 02523 02461 02502 02543 02564 02595 02625 02666 02707 02646 02605 02605 02584 02574 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02554 02543 02554 02554 02554 02554 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02533 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02543 02533 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02543 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02523 02513 02513 02502 02502 02492 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02482 02472 02472 02472 02461 02461 02461 02461 02451 02451 02451 02461 02461 02451 02451 02451 02451 02451 02451 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02441 02431 02441 02431 02441 02431 02420 02431 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02420 02410 02420 02410 02410 02410 02410 02400 02400 02410 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02400 02390 02390 02390 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02380 02370 02370 02380 02370 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02359 02349 02349 02349 02349 02349 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 02339 codepre

Negative 1602 pOk, so say you have a really big Range in ruby. I want to find a way to get the max value in the Range.p  pThe Range is exclusive defined with three dots meaning that it does not include the end object in its results. It could be made up of Integer, String, Time, or really any object that responds to codeltgtcode and codesucccode. which are the only requirements for the startend object in Rangep  pHeres an example of an exclusive rangep  precode  past   Time.local2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0   now    Time.now   range  past...now    range.includenow   gt false codepre  pNow I know I could just do something like this to get the max valuep  precode  range.max   gt returns 1 second before now using Enumerablemax codepre  pBut this will take a nontrivial amount of time to execute. I also know that I could subtract 1 second from whatever the end object is is. However, the object may be something other than Time, and it may not even support codecode. I would prefer to find an efficient general solution, but I am willing to combine special case code with a fallback to a general solution more on that later.p  pAs mentioned above using codeRangelastcode wont work either, because its an exclusive range and does not include the last value in its results.p  pThe fastest approach I could think of was thisp  precode  max  nil   range.each  value max  value      max now contains nil if the range is empty, or the max value codepre  pThis is similar to what codeEnumerablemaxcode does which Range inherits, except that it exploits the fact that each value is going to be greater than the previous, so we can skip using codeltgtcode to compare the each value with the previous the way codeRangemaxcode does saving a tiny bit of time.p  pThe other approach I was thinking about was to have special case code for common ruby types like Integer, String, Time, Date, DateTime, and then use the above code as a fallback. Itd be a bit ugly, but probably much more efficient when those object types are encountered because I could use subtraction from codeRangelastcode to get the max value without any iterating.p  pCan anyone think of a more efficientfaster approach than thisp

Negative 1602 pI have a linqtosql object from a table. I want to store a similar data in the profile collection. Technically, I dont need all of the data in the linq2sql table and do not really prefer the legacy naming construct. My first thought would be to create a collection of CRUD objects.p  pBut, if I choose this solution I will have double the classes with much overlapping functionality. If I use the linq2sql objects asis then Ill be dealing with abstractions that contain more data then necessary.p  pTo give you a more clear example, I will create an example that is similarp  pThis goes into the database and a linq2sql abstraction is createdp  precodeNoteSaved Date Id UserId Text .... Custom Methods codepre  pThis goes into the user profilep  precode[Serializable] SavedSearchText Text  ... Custom Methods codepre  pSavedSearchText doesnt need the junk like id, userid, and date, and that data doesnt even make sense for it. But yet the custom functionality will overlap for both classes.p  pI see 2 trivial approachesp  ol liCreated a whole new set of objects that are CRUD just for this purposeli liUse the linq2sql objects as a proxy for the CRUD, i.e using my wisdom that these objects are not really those objectsli ol  pI was going the route 1 but see a lot of duplication. It is not very DRY. What are some solutions that keep things as DRY as possible while also maintaining a clear architecture In other words, I want to avoid having to duplicate the same methods for every object AND I want to avoid storing unneeded data to the profile, such as Ids or DateStored which are not required.p  pI thought this should be obvious but SavedSearchText and SearchText share a common data field text and common functionality, i.e SomeFunction1, SomeFunction2, i.e FindText.p  pEditUpdatep  pTypically this would be handled with inheritance. Wed have a base business class Text and then 2 derived types SavedText and UserText. But, with linq2sql I do not see a way to do this keeping with DRY principle.p  pOne might also choose to solve via containment via hasa relationship but that is not really not right for this context.p  pObviously one could create own business layer but that also doesnt keep with dry, as linq2sql has much of the functionality already required.p  pPerhaps the cleanest solution would be to create CRUD objects but that only readdump back into the linq2sql objects. Unfortunately, these linq2sql objects will not actually be tables and some fields wont make sense. that appears to be the DRYiest solution.p  pIt may even be possible in this case to use advanced methods such as extension methods which would extend both classes but I prefer not to use extension methods unless required.p

Negative 1602 pIm not sure whether this is a misconfiguration on my part, a misunderstanding of what can be accomplished via codeModelAttributecode and automatic JSON content conversion, or a bug in either Spring or Jackson. If it turns out to be the latter, of course, Ill file an issue with the appropriate folks.p  pIve encountered a problem with adding a codeModelAttributecode to a controllers handler method. The intent of the method is to expose a bean thats been populated from a form or previous submission, but I can reproduce the issue without actually submitting data into the bean.p  pIm using the Spring mvcshowcase sample. Its currently using Spring 3.1, but I first encountered, and am able to reproduce, this issue on my 3.0.5 setup.

Negative 1602 pIm using GCD to do some background loading from the internet. This works great except for a little flaw. In my app I have 3 tabs and when clicking on any tab the GCD starts to do the background loading for the appropriate tab. If the user decides to go from the first tab to the second tab when the GCD has started downloaded data for the first tab and then returns to the first tab again. GCD will start another background thread even though the first background thread hasnt finished downloaded the data yet. p  pSo is there a way to check if a background thread is currently running So that it doesnt start multiple background threads if the user would choose to switch tabs back and forth very quickly for some reason.p

Negative 1602 pIm currently working on some telephony integration with Asterisk and a PHP web interface.  I want to give the user an option to upload their own custom greeting in a wav file, and then once its on the server convert the wav to a gsm file at 8000hz.  Currently, im trying to use sox to accomplish this.p  pHowever, it seems like when I convert between anything other than an 8khz sav to gsm, the gsm file is severely distorted.  Its almost like it slows down the file by a factor of 10 a 3 second intro in wav format turns into a 30 second gsm file  Ive tried several combinations of speed and resampling to no avail.  Ideally, I would like to take any wav file thats uploaded and convert it, without putting too much responsibility on the user to encode it properly.  Im definitely not an audiophile, so if anybody could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.p
Negative 1602 pIve recently been introduced to development for iOS by a friend and have begun to experiment with the interface builder and view controllers. One thing Im finding is that when using a nib in conjunction with a view controller, your view controllers ivars are quickly polluted with views you may never actually reference. I would like to modularize the key components in my main nib into several different views. I have two questions regarding thisp  ol listrikeHow can I create a nib file for a custom sized view one that doesnt fill the entire screenstrikeli liHow can I add the newly modularized to my main nib all of the classes I would create for the components would be view controllers not viewsli listrikeAssuming I were to alloc and init the view controllers and add them to the main view programmatically, how could I position the custom sized views since I have already called codeinitWithNibNamebundlecode.

It seems that in the attributes inspector of your nib file you must disable the status bar change it to unspecified to enable the editing of the height and width parameters in the size inspector.

Negative 1602 pRight now we have a UIScrollView that has one subview, a UIView.  This UIView holds two UIImageView subviews, one is a static background image.  The second UIImageView is a view for users to draw on, which we handle using CGContext.p  pWe are using a scrollview because the background image and drawing area are large. When the user selects a button that enters drawing mode, they can swipe with two fingers to scroll and use one finger to draw.  This all works fine.p  pThe problem is when we leave drawing mode and try zooming in. The background image zooms perfectly, but the drawing UIImageView on top of it does something strange. It will stay the normal size for a couple seconds, disappear, and then suddenly appear at the zoomed in size. So it is zooming in, but theres some very strange behavior and a delay before it does.p  pFor reference, here is how we handle the drawing.p  precode  When the user first starts moving the pen    voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       isMouseMoved  YES      UITouch touch  [touches anyObject]      CGPoint currentPoint  [touch locationInViewimageView]        Setting up the context     UIGraphicsBeginImageContextimageView.frame.size     [imageView.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, imageView.frame.size.width, imageView.frame.size.height]      ifisEraserOn         CGContextSetLineWidthUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, eraserRadius         CGContextSetBlendModeUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, kCGBlendModeClear         CGRect eraserFrame  eraser.frame          eraserFrame.origin.x  currentPoint.x  eraserRadius2         eraserFrame.origin.y  currentPoint.y  eraserRadius2         eraser.frame  eraserFrame      else         CGContextSetLineWidthUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, penRadius         CGContextSetRGBStrokeColorUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, r, g, b, 1.0          CGContextSetBlendModeUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, kCGBlendModeNormal           CGContextBeginPathUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     CGContextMoveToPointUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, lastPoint.x, lastPoint.y     CGContextAddLineToPointUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, currentPoint.x, currentPoint.y     CGContextStrokePathUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      imageView.image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext      UIGraphicsEndImageContext      lastPoint  currentPoint      mouseMoved       if mouseMoved  1          mouseMoved  0         codepre  pDoes anyone have any idea whats going on with our drawing UIImageView We thought the delay might be due to antialiasing when it zooms in, but we tried disabling that and we still encounter the same problem.p

I have fiddled with the folder structures, but the file path is correct, the codefilerepositorycode folder has all readwriteexecute permissions and belongs to the PHP owner and owner groups which in this case is codenobodynobodycode.

Negative 1602 pI will start a system and we have chosed rails because it covers all our needs.p  pWe need consistency on database updates in some point of the system and I remember that I found in some official documentation that rails can check for the versions of the records automatically, however I have googled a lot and I cannot find those pages again.p  pThe problem is the followingp  ul liSuppose that there exists a record in a table of the database. Lets say, an account.li liSuppose that a user named Bob finds that record and starts editing it. Lets say that the user is changing its name from Incomings to Sales.li liSuppose that at the time Bob is editing the record, another user named Susan find exactly the same record and starts editing it. Lets say that Susan wants to change the name of the account from Incomings to Service fees.li liThen, Bob saves his changes.li liAfter Bob saves his changes, Susan tries to save her changes.li ul  pAt this point, the system should inform to Susan that another user has changed the record and her changes cannot be saved.p  pI can do this validation manually, but I remember that this can be done by Rails automatically. I remember that the only requeriment on the tables of the database where is required this validation is to add a version column and Rails will take care of this. Really I dont remember if the column must be called version or something else, but the fact is that only a columns enables this feature.p  pThe problem is that I cannot find that documentation anymore. If anyone could provide me the link to that documentation I will be thankful, because the requeriment of the version column is all what I remember and I want to know what other things I must take care of.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1602 pI have a problem with returning collection and covariance and I was wondering if anyone has a better solution.p  pThe scenario is thisp  pI have 2 version of implementation and I would like to keep the version implementation completely separate even though they might have the same logic. In the implementation, I would like to return a list of items and therefore in the interface, I would return a list of interface of the item. However, in the actual implementation of the interface, I would like to return the concrete object of the item. In code, it looks something like this.p  precodeinterface IItem       some properties here   interface IResult      IListltIItemgt Items  get   codepre  pThen, there would be 2 namespaces which has concrete implementation of these interfaces. For example,p  pNamespace Version1p  precodeclass Item  IItem  class Result  IResult      public ListltItemgt Items              get   get the list from somewhere            IListltIItemgt IResult.Items              get                       due to covariance, i have to convert it             return this.Items.ToListltIItemgt                codepre  pThere will be another implementation of the same thing under namespace Version2.p  pTo create these objects, there will be a factory that takes the version and create the appropriate concrete type as needed.p  pIf the caller knows the exact version and does the following, the code works finep  precodeVersion1.Result result  new Version1.Result result.Items.Addsomething codepre  pHowever, I would like the user to be able to do something like this.p  precodeIResult result   create from factory result.Items.Addsomething codepre  pBut, because its been converted to another list, the add will not do anything because the item will not be added back to the original result object.p  pI can think of a few solutions such asp  ol liI could synchronize the two lists but that seems to be extra work to doli liReturn IEnumerable instead of IList and add a method for createdelete collectionsli liCreate a custom collection that takes the TConcrete and TInterfaceli ol  pI understand why this is happening due to the type safe and all, but none of workaround I think can of seems very elegant. Does anybody have better solutions or suggestionsp  pThanks in advancep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter thinking about this more, I think I can do the followingp  precodepublic interface ICustomCollectionltTInterfacegt  ICollectionltTInterfacegt    public class CustomCollectionltTConcrete, TInterfacegt  ICustomCollectionltTInterfacegt where TConcrete  class, TInterface      public void AddTConcrete item               do add           void ICustomCollectionltTInterfacegt.AddTInterface item               validate that item is TConcrete and add to the collection.          otherwise throw exception indicating that the add is not allowed due to incompatible type            rest of the implementation  codepre  pthen I can havep  precodeinterface IResult      ICustomCollectionltIItemgt Items  get    then for implementation, I will have  class Result  IResult      public CustomCollectionltItem, IItemgt Items  get       ICustomCollectionltTItemgt IResult.Items              get  return this.Items        codepre  pthat way, if the caller is accessing the Result class, it will go through the CustomCollection.AddTConcrete item which is already TConcrete. If the caller is accessing through IResult interface, it will go through customCollection.AddTInterface item and the validation will happen and make sure the type is actually TConcrete.p  pI will give it a try and see if this would work.p

Negative 1602 pI developed a Java application in Netbeans, and Im going to release it soon so Im working on making it less ugly. Since Im developing on a Mac, the GUI builder uses the Mac Look amp Feel, which looks decent, but many of my users wont be using Macs. The default LampF is Nimbus, which looks fine except for the buttons, which have annoying borders that are not overridden by the manually setting the borders you can see how the manual borders look in the image. With the manually set borders, the Nimbus LampF adds its own odd border inside the border I made, which just looks idiotic. Without the manually set borders, Nimbuss borders overlap in visually unappealing ways, and in order to avoid overlap I have to space the buttons really far apart, which I also dont like. p  pI tried using the other LampFs available in Netbeans Metal and something else, but theyre just too ugly to stand.p  pBasically, I would like some advice on how to customize the way buttons look in this application. I dont want to write a button drawing function from scratch or design my own images. I just want a way to change the settings so things dont look stupid. I read in various places that the Substance LampF is good, but I cant find where to download it anywhere. If someone could link me to a download page for Substance or recommend another popular, simple and not stupidlooking LampF, I would greatly appreciate it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv2TOo.png altDecent looking under Mac LampFp

So I started modifying the T4 template to add a codeIsDirtycode boolean property upon generation of those entities, added an event that is fired whenever codeIsDirtycode changes and added codethis.IsDirty  truecode in the xxxChanged methods of all scalar properties.p  pEverything works great when the entity is not attached to its context but when attached, whenever a property is changed, thus changing the codeIsDirtycode value to codefalsecode, I receive this exceptionp  blockquote   pThe property IsDirty does not have a valid entity mapping on the   entity object. For more information, see the Entity Framework   documentation.p blockquote  pSo what am I doing wrong here I dont want this property to be mapped in my database as it is just an object status that only matters when the object is alive. Is there an attribute I should use to decorate the codeIsDirtycode property Or should I derive EntityObject and implement the status mechanism Or maybe you have any better advice on how to implement thisp  pThanks.p  hr  pEdit I am using Entity Framework 4.0 with EDM designer.p  pHere is the piece of code generated into every base entityp  precodeprivate bool isDirty    public event EventHandler DirtyStatusChanged  public bool IsDirty      get              return this.isDirty           internal set              if this.isDirty  value                      ReportPropertyChangingIsDirty             this.isDirty  value             ReportPropertyChangedIsDirty             ReportDirtyStatusChanged                 protected void ReportDirtyStatusChanged      var handler  this.DirtyStatusChanged      ifhandler  null              handlerthis, EventArgs.Empty       codepre

Negative 1602 pI have a very essential question about a basic concept regarding synchronization of multiple clients that share a common databasep  pI plan to design a distributed application using Java and JPA for persistence. Assumed that I have a central database that hosts all enterprise data and multiple clients connect to this database for querying data, what would be the best approach to keep the particular clients synchronized in means of the data in the database p  pE.g. Client A updates the surname of a customer while Client B is already logged in to the database and has retrieved its persistence context. How can I inform Client B about the changes of the customers propertiesp  pIs there any possibility in JPA to test entities in persistentcontext on changes Or do I need a JMS like network service that informs all active clients about any changes in the databasep  pAny suggestions highly appreciated Thanks in advance...p

Negative 1602 pAs mentioned elsewhere the way of passing instances between Android activities, is either to make the passing object implement the serializable or parcelable interface. As I see it, this is fine as long your Android app is intented for showing your dogs age and name. Using slightly more advanced objects without using a static reference is problematic.p  pThe object to be passed is using e.g. an external library for its purpose. For serializing to work all used classes incl. in the library needs to declare this interface, otherwise Android will throw a runtime IOException, stating the object could not be serialized something is not impl. the serializable interface or has no noarg constructor. So a library recompilation is required for the serializable approach to work I guess. The Parcel approach requires the objects fields to be written to some output. This output supports custom objects, but then again the passing object incl. library needs to implement the serializable interface to work.p  pWhat is the solution for passing an instance using an external libraryp

The code below in the latest chrome demonstrates what I dont want.p  pThe effect Im getting is like I expect clear left to behave if applied to the fourth floated div.p  pThe code below works only on a resolution where 3  400px is less than the screen width but 4  400 is greater than screen width.p  pThis image shows whats happening, I want the fourth div where Ive shown with an arrow instead of where it is a hrefhttpimg687.imageshack.usimg6872613desired.png relnofollowhttpimg687.imageshack.usimg6872613desired.pngap  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltstylegt         .div1                      float left             backgroundcolor black             height 100px             width 400px                  .div2                      backgroundcolor red             height 200px             width 400px             float left                  .div3                      float left             backgroundcolor blue             height 500px             width 400px                  .div4                      backgroundcolor green             float left             height 100px             width 400px              ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt      ltdiv classdiv1gtltdivgt     ltdiv classdiv2gtltdivgt     ltdiv classdiv3gtltdivgt     ltdiv classdiv4gtltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre
Negative 1602 pI have an application in which it would be very convenient for me to have a mouse click event emulate a user typing in a certain string to standard input. So I was wondering, is there a way in code to WRITE to standard in I realize its a bit of a hack, but it would work very well for what I need to do.p  pEDIT in response to Hovercrafts EDIT2p  pThanks. I understand how that code keeps the human player from moving a piece when they shouldnt. What I dont understand is how you are envisioning the main game loop. Would you mind writing code to show me what youre thinking for that Are you just picturing a busywait loop that constantly generates new computer moves and calls your codeMovecode method most of the time being rejected while its waiting for the human player to make a move Something like thisp  precodepublic void gameLoop     while gameNotOver           Move compMove  generateComputersNextMove       moveblackPlayer, compMove  where the blackPlayer is the computerPlayer       codepre

Negative 1602 pIm trying to verify if data exists in two different tables in a single transaction. The reason for the single transaction is the database gets hit about 13 million times a day so adding anymore than 1 extra transaction would increase that number up to 9 million, and my poor little server needs a break p  pSo I need to check if an ID exists in table X and table Y and return the results to my VB.net script so I can handle the outcome Ideally something like this would workp  precodeif exists select id from X where id  id print True, else print False, if exists select id from Y where id  id print True else print False codepre  pWhich gives me True, True if exists in both or True, False etc etc... But that only displays in SQL print and not actually returning it as an objectstring or array values that I can use.p  pIm open to any sort of solution of this nature that can give me two results from a single transaction and how to handle that response in vb. Thanksp
Negative 1602 pI have an ICEfaces web app which contains a component with a property linked to a backing bean variable. In theory, variable value is programmatically modified, and the component sees the change and updates its appearanceproperties accordingly.p  pHowever, it seems that the change in variable isnt noticed by the component until the end of the JSF cycle which, from my basic understanding, is the a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkslibraryjjsf2 relnofollowrender response phasea. p  pThe problem is, I have a long filecopy operation to perform, and I would like the the inputText component to show a periodic status update. However, since the component is only updated at the render response phase, it doesnt show emanyem output until the Java methods have finished executing, and it shows it all changes accumulated at once.p  pI have tried using codeFacesContext.getCurrentInstance.renderResponsecode and other functions, such as codePushRenderer.renderString IDcode to force XmlHttpRequest to initialize early, but no matter what, the appearance of the component does not change until the Java code finishes executing.p  pOne possible solution that comes to mind is to have an invisible button somewhere that is automatically pressed by the bean when step 1 of the long operation completes, and by clicking it, it calls step 2, and so on and so forth. It seems like it would work, but I dont want to spend time hacking together such an inelegant solution when I would hope that there is a more elegant solution built into JSFICEfaces.  p  pAm I missing something, or is resorting to ugly hacks the only way to achieve the desired behaviorp

Negative 1602 pI was given an existing dashboard at work and am new to the whole Java Servlets with Spring Framework deal. p  pSo the pages that are there work, and the flow is that there is the RequestMapping annotation for the method inside the controller. For Examplep  precodeRequestMappingindex.do public ModelAndView index throws Exception      LoginDO oLoginDO  new LoginDO            return new ModelAndViewindex,oLoginDO,oLoginDO  codepre  pThe servlet.xml file maps the views to jsp files, and its all working.p  pBut my issue is, when I edit the controller.java file and create another method returning a new view, which is for a new page to the webpage, the change isnt being recognized by the servlet. It says No matching handler method found for servlet request.p  pNow heres the thing, I believe this is happening because somehow the Spring Framework isnt being updated dont know if this is the right term when the edits are made in controller.java. I deployed my source code from a WAR file in Eclipse, then run it on a Tomcat server. Heres the deal, my mentors code is working fine along with the edits, but I believe that he created a Tomcat project, and the project directories are different, and the edits are updated onto the website immediately after a save. p  pNote that when I change the JSPs to the existing pages, the updates are recognized immediately, its only when I create a new JSP and a new RequestMapping annotation along with a new method, its not working. I even tried print statements within the controller.java and nothings showing.p  pSo I guess this is an Eclipse question and deployment question more than anything, but any help would be great Not too sure what to do to fix this. Ive even tried restarting the server, to no success though. Thanksp

Negative 1602 pI have a wcf data service that is being consumed by my applications within my organization. It contains the following entitiesp  precodeClient User Membership codepre  pThe data is setup in as multitenant and currently requires what we call a client string, or the string representation of the clients unique id, to be passedin as part of the path and I extract that and add that in a query interceptor as a filter. This has worked beautifully up until recently when we had a new client come onboard that has a parent clientstring with many children. So the result is a query that includes a list of clientids passedin for all queries as an in ...... Not too bad but when this client now attempts to query memberships they have 9k clientids passedin. The resultant query seems to run fairly quickly when executed alone but the entire db transaction is taking 30 seconds consistently.p  pI would ultimately like to find a way to bypass this filter for such queries if a specific userid is provided. The URL looks like thisp  pa hrefhttpservice.comclientaUsers1234memberships relnofollowhttpservice.comclientaUsers1234membershipsap  pIf a specific id is given for users or memberships I can avoid the filter as the effectively achieves the same endresult. What we cant have is someone doing something like thisp  pa hrefhttpservice.comclientamemberships relnofollowhttpservice.comclientamembershipsap  pWithout any filter.p  pI realize this may be scattered and require much more detail as this was a bit rushed. Please ask any questions. Any help or guidance is much appreciated.p

Negative 1602 pIm trying to develop some effective integration tests for my GAEj application.  Im familiar with a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsjavatoolslocalunittestinghttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsjavatoolslocalunittestinga  these tools are great for small unit tests.  Im now interested in developing integration tests that test actual web requests.  For example, Id like to test that web.xml is mapping servlets and filters to the expected URLs and test that my JSPs generate what I expect.p  pMy aim was to bring up a local development server inside the JVM, which I could fire requests against.  Im open to other integration strategies, though as I say above, I just want to effectively test JSP generation and other requestlevel features.p  pIve managed to use DevAppServerFactory to start a development server in the same JVM.  However, it appears that the DevAppServer this generates uses a separate classloader from the main JVM.  This makes testing a lot more challengingI cant use any of the local unittesting LocalTestConfig classes to control behavior of this server.  Similarly, I cant roll my own hooks for modifying behavior via e.g. statics, since the statics I can mutate in the test harness arent the same statics the DevAppServer is looking at.  This makes it challenging to skip features not central to the current test e.g. requiring login, to inject failures, to inject mocks, etc.  This really limits how completely and efficiently I can test my code.p  pIve found a real dearth of documentation on the web for integration testing with App Engine.  Im sure someone has done this before...are there any tips or resources out there you can sharep

Negative 1602 pIm currently developing a site for my Universitys library, and a very strange issue came up.

It happens in all browsers. Im pretty sure its happening on both of ours because weve handled code, but I cant think of any CSS rules that would be affecting it. To make it worse, its affecting two different CSSsthe old site which I have not touched and the new site which is intended to be rolled out tomorrow. Ive tried fixing the way the computer displays fonts, the way browsers display fonts, changed the resolution, and tried zooming in. None of those methods worked.

Given 5 input parameters A, B, C, D, and E all varchar50 that correspond to the 5 columns A, B, C, D, and E in my table, Id like to find the record with the most matching columns.  Each column that doesnt match in the chosen record should contain a space  . p  pFor example, if I have the input Sony, PlayStation, Controller, Black, Damaged, and my table contains the following columnsp  precodeSony  Playstation  Unit   Black  Damaged Sony  Playstation                  codepre  pIt should return the second row, because 2 parameters match and for the 3 that dont, there are spaces.  I dont want to return the first row because even though 4 parameters match, the middle one does not match and it is not a space.  If it had been a space, the first row would have been the winner.p  pstrongMy Approachstrongp  pThere are various specifics that I cannot reveal, but my basic approach note that Im an SQL novice was to test every combination from MOST specific to LEAST specific.  So my query would look something like thisp  precode start with most specific SELECT  FROM dbo.Items WHERE    A  A    B  B    C  C    D  D    E  E   if no matches, try next IF ROWCOUNT  0 SELECT  FROM dbo.Items WHERE    A  A    B  B    C  SPACE1    D  D    E  E  ... etc. codepre  pIn my case, I only need to really test 16 configurations, because some of the permutations will never exist.  Even so, this seems like a very inefficient way to achieve what I want.  On top of that, its not even working.  It seems like comparing against spaces is problematic because of some autotrimming thats going on.  In any case, my current approach seems inefficient and it doesnt work  so I turn to you for help.p

Negative 1602 pIm wondering if someone can enlighted me a little bit on the Xpages build process and how this works with other replica copies of a database.  Much of the advice Ive seen posted regarding working with the the Domino Designer indicates logically, that youll have much faster response working on local copies and then replicating those to the server.p  pIll usually save my changes locally, build manually, and replicate to the server, and most of the time, that seems to work fine.  However, on some occasions, Ive found that when I view the work Ive done in the browser on the server copy, it hasnt seemed to update... in fact in a couple of scary incidents, it displays a version from several weeks ago where is it even getting that from.  This isnt a browser caching issue, and Ive opened the design elements xpages, custom controls on the server copy and verified that the changes ARE there.  I end up having to perform a Clean on the server copy not just a build of the application, and then it displays as expected. p  pThis seems like a foolish question, but you shouldnt have to perform a build on each replica copy correct  Any thoughts as to what might be an issue here  There is another developer involved, and he works directly on the server as hes in the same location, but we are rarely working at the same time, and never on the same elements.  We are not using source control at this time.p

Negative 1602 pI wanna do navigationA on a QuadTree. p  pI already implemented a QuadTree, or at least what I think is a QuadTree. Meanwhile I have seen some where also the inner nodes contain elements. With mine the inner nodes only link to their children and the elements are stored in collections in leaf nodes. While each node links to its parent there are currently no links to the neighbors, neither siblings nor nodes of other branches. Elements are regions and not just points.p  pI have also seen A quite some time on grids and even a demo on QuadTree, but this was without details.p  pI guess the main question is how do I quickly get to my neighborsp  pI am not sure if I should keep the leafs linked to each other. But this would be a hell of a job as the tree is dynamic as the elements update their position. It would also need need some king of dynamic collection for the links as depending on the node size a big leaf can have a lot of small leafs on one direction e.g. East. The effort to update this seems quite huge, even currently dont know how I would do it.p  pThx n rgdsp

Negative 1602 pI have four tasks t1, t2, t3, t4 that need to be run in sequence on an item a URL every 7 days. I use gearman to run these tasks and a cronjob to send the items to the gearman queue. Each task for an item has a daterun assigned to it. If daterun for t1 is less than 7 days from now that task is sent to the queue. If daterun for t2 is less than t1, that task is sent to the queue... and so on.p  pThe problem I have is if t1 for an item has been queued but has not had time to finish before the cronjob kicks in again. Since the daterun is not updated until the task is complete it will look like the task hasnt been queued and Ill have duplicates of t1 for the same item in the queue.p  pThe solutions Ive thought of arep  ul liAdd an unique identifiers to each task and check if theyve been queued alreadyli liJust check if the queue is empty or not and dont queue any more tasks until it isli liAdd a datequeued to the item table and use this instead of daterun on t1 to schedule the tasks every 7 daysli ul  pI thought Id check on stackoverflow first though, if there is a best way to solve this problem I cant seem to get my head around it.

Negative 1602 pI am trying to implement a simple NSTextField with autocomplete that behaves more like a JQuery UI autocomplete httpjqueryui.comautocomplete than the default behavior of NSSearchField.  The difference between the two is that with JQuery UI the user has to manually select one of the suggestions before it becomes active in the textfield, whereas with the NS methods the first suggestion is automatically selected.p  pThe reason is that the list of suggestions I will provide to the user are not going to match the text, but instead will be related.  For example, if the user types app, instead of suggesting apple, I will suggest fruit.  Unfortunately, with the default behavior, if the first item is automatically selected, then the textfield will change to fruit as soon as it is suggested, which is not the desired behavior I want it to stay as app until the user selects fruit themselves.p  pIs it possible to prevent the first item from automatically being selected  The closest solution I have found is listed below.  While it does prevent the text from being overwritten, I would prefer to not have any item selected at all, since the list is meant to be a list of valid entries, and by showing what the user has typed as the first item, it would incorrectly indicate that the input is always valid.  So in other words, I am trying to use the autocomplete to both speed entry as well as restrict the input to valid entries.  p  pClosest solution found so far a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3981439howtopreventnssearchfieldfromoverwritingenteredstringsusingthefirstaus10e576bea71041fabcc242ee6eb64f73How to prevent NSSearchField from overwriting entered strings using the first autocompletion list entryap

Negative 1602 pI have a functional facebook application that use the JS SDK. I can use the JS SDK to get my users facebook ID and access token, and it seem to work fine. However, my JS script need to call some server side PHP code via JQuery AJAX, in order to make some server side related operations... but i still need an access to my users access token on the PHP code as well. On the official facebook documentation of the PHP SDK, i saw the followingp  blockquote   pThe Facebook SDK for PHP can work in conjunction with the Facebook SDK for Javascript to provide seamless session management across both the client and serversides of an app.p      pTo enable this functionality, ensure that when you embed and initialize the JS SDK, you set both the status and the cookie parameters of the object passed to FB.init to true.p blockquote  pI followed the exact instructions as written above, but it looks like my PHP code fails to get the users facebook ID and access token after I initialize my facebook PHP object.p  pWhat do I miss i dont understand it, because by what the documentation say, my users access token should be passed automatically to the PHP SDK using a cookie.p  pShould it be done in some other wayp  pThanksp

Negative 1602 pIm writing an asp.net 4.5 application using the new routing features. I have a page that displays some information about an item. In the codePageLoadcode event I check the route data item id and user permissions, and if something isnt right e.g. the id is for a deleted item I use codeResponse.RedirectToRoutecode to send them packing, right back to the home page. Do not pass GO, do not collect 200.p  pThis made perfect sense until I tried to access a deleted item and instead of the home page I got an error page. I did some digging and discovered that even after I use codeRedirectToRoutecode unlike the standard codeRedirectcode method the rest of the page code a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd783087.aspxcontinues to executea, which at the very least seems wasteful since Im just going to throw away the results and throws errors when the necessary data doesnt exist.p  pI did a little more SO mining and discovered the incredible a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1087777isresponseendconsideredharmful39171803917180emevilema that is codeResponse.Endcode. It does what I need, but even the MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.httpresponse.end.aspxpagea tells me that codeResponse.Endcode is the bastard child of an ancient accursed language and isnt fit to see the light of day. The primary objection seems to be the fact that Response.End throws an exception, and thats bad for performance. Im not the most experienced developer, so I dont understand the issue entirely, but I have trouble believing that throwing an exception is more expensive than loading the entire web page. The a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma39171801812515workaroundsa seem rather complex and excessive for a task so simple, especially since most pages require some kind of validity check.p  pWhat am I supposed to do in this situation Use codeResponse.Endcode and beg forgiveness for my insolence Cobble together some ugly workaround Or is my perspective on the problem all wrong to begin with Id really like to know.p  pUpdate Now that Ive thought it over a bit more, I wonder if I do have the wrong perspective on the problem. Perhaps an immediate redirect is the not the best response for the user experience. Would I be better off wrapping all the controls in a panel, and using something like thisp  precodePrivate Sub PageInitsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Me.Init     Validation Code     If notValid Then         ControlsPanel.Visible  false         ErrorPanel.Visible  true     End If End Sub codepre

Negative 1602 pThe more I read about this, the more I get confused. It seems easy while reading, but few seconds later, it just bounces over my head. Anyway, here is my question.p  pI have a published app, and I wish to add admob advertising to it. As far as I read, i need to have the targetSDKVersion in my manifest file, to be 13 or higher. When i set the targetSDKVersion to 13, eclipse shows me a warning saying, p  pNot targeting the latest versions of Android compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSIONCODES javadoc for details.p  pWell, as of now, this is my understanding of minSDKVersion and targetSDKVersion. p  pminSDKVersion  this is for backward compatability. I have my minSDKVersion set to 10, for Android 2.3.3, which is the version i developed my application. So, people with a minimum of Android version of 2.3.3 will be able to use my application.p  ptargetSDKVersion  this is to tell that I have used a feature in my application, that belonged to the targetSDKVersion and people with versions equal to and above will get to see that feature, where as people with lower versions, will be able to use the application, but doesnt get to see the feature. p  pSo, if my understanding is correct, what about the warning What does this warning meanp  pAnd also, admob states that it requires a minimum of Android 1.5 or later. But the documentation says, compile against Android version 3.2. What about thisp  pI am pretty new to android as well as admob, so please bear with me, if these are pretty basic questions.p  pThanksp

Negative 1602 pI have a tablep  pSourceID, TargetID, Amount, Year.p  pI also have a view. This view is looking at differences between a row and the row above it in the same table. I use CTE to do thisp  precode    WITH cte as SELECT ROWNUMBER OVER  PARTITION BY SourceID ORDER BY ...  as rowNum,  SourceId, TargetID, Amount, Year FROM table      Select      t1.SourceID as SourceID1,  t2.SourceID as SourceID2,  t1.TargetID as TargetID1,  t2.TargetID as TargetID2,  t1.Year,  t1.Amount  t2.Amount as Difference      FROM cte t1     LEFT JOIN cte t2 ON t1.SourceID  t2.SourceID and t1.rowNum  t2.rowNum1  codepre  pI now have 2 columns in that view. TargetID1 and TargetID2. TargetID2 is the same as TargetID1 in the row above. Sometimes TargetID2 is null, because the conditions were not met in the left join displayed above. That is fine. Selecting  from this view is exactly what I need.p  pThe problem here is when I want to select conditionally. For example I only want to select rows that have 2012 as year. Ofcourse technically this is not a problem, but when the first row in 2012 is comparing itself to the now invisible last row of 2011 the customer gets confused. They want Difference to be empty NULL when its the first row in the resultset meeting the join conditions.p  pSo I wrote thisp  precodeSELECT     SourceID1, SourceID2, TargetID1, TargetID2, Year,     case when TargetID2 is null     then null     else case when TargetID2 NOT IN          select TargetID1 from view where Year  2012     then null     else Difference     end     end as Difference, FROM view where Year  2012 codepre  pThis actually worked... It took a little longer because its a fairly large table, but it was acceptable. Now we are adding a percentage the difference in percentage. This means that this last query is expanded with another conditional select checking the exact same contion.p  precodecase when TargetID2 is null    then null    else case when TargetID2 NOT IN      select TargetID1 from view where Year  2012    then null    else Percentage    end    end as Percentage codepre  pSo this is getting very consuming.p  pMy question is what should I do Changes to the solution in general, to the view or to the query are all fine. There are no limitations whatsoever as long as the filtered result shows the first row with a null as difference and percentage and the query performs.p  pSorry for the large post. Didnt know how else to put this.p  pThanksp  pEDITp  pI was not clear enough on problem. If Year would be the only concern I could do some of the suggestions below, but its not. I simplified the table and view so it would be more readable, but there are other columns and other things one can filter on.p  pThere is also a month column. So if I want to see october 2011  februari 2012 then the last row of 2011 should be compared to the first row of 2012. Here the first row of october should have the NULL Difference and Percentage columns because its TargetID2 does not exist in the TargetID1 column...p  pI hope that clears it up. Maybe I should start from scratch with this question.p

The only reason I kept the code like this is to show that I have tried multiple versions of the scaling and all of them have not worked like I had hoped.  I know the problem lies somewhere in these two methods as I have another method for nonbackground resources and they work fine.  The only reason I am using this one is for larger image files to avoid having an Out of Memory exception.p

Negative 1602 pSo I have a program that spawns threads 5150 which perform a bunch of tasks. Originally I used a FixedThreadPool because a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions949355newcachedthreadpoolvsnewfixedthreadpoolthis similar questiona suggested they were better suited for longer lived tasks and with my very limited knowledge of multithreading, I considered the average life of the threads several minutes long lived. p  pHowever, I recently added the capability to spawn additional threads and doing so takes me above the thread limit I set. In this case, would it be better to guess and increase the number threads I can allow or to switch to a CachedThreadPool so I have no wasted threadsp  pTrying them both out preliminarily, there doesnt emseemem to be a difference so Im inclined to go with the CachedThreadPool just to avoid the waste. However, does the life span of the threads mean I should instead picked a FixedThreadPool and just deal with the unused threads a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13110313javafixedthreadpoolwithknownpoolsizebutunknownworkersThis questiona makes it seem like those extra threads arent wasted but I would appreciate the clarification.p

My naive thoughts are that it would be better to pass these iterators by constreference to avoid copying the iterator objectsp  precodetemplateltclass InputIteratorgt typename iteratortraitsltInputIteratorgtdifferencetype distance const InputIterator ampfirst, const InputIterator amplast codepre  pOne could say that iterators are in general very small objects and that copying them is not expensive. But even still cheap copying would be more expensive than no copying at all.p  pSo what is the reason that in the STLversion, the iterators are passed by valuep  pThank you p

Negative 1602 pI was reading the Guice documentation, and came across a section labeled a hrefhttpscode.google.compgoogleguicewikiCyclicDependenciesEliminatethecycle28Recommended29 relnofollowEliminate the Cycle Recommendeda which peaked my interest because its exactly the issue that led me to the documentation today.p  pBasically, to eliminate cyclic dependencies, you extract the Dependency Case into a separate class. emOkay, nothing new there.emp  pSo, in the example, we have.p  precodepublic class Store          private final Boss boss         private final CustomerLine line         ...

No problems with this concept, and easily doable with classic Dependency Injectionp  precodeCustomerLine customerLine  new CustomerLine Clerk clerk  new ClerkcustomerLine Boss boss  new Bossclerk Store store  new Storeboss, customerLine codepre  pThats easy enough, but now, I need to do this with Guice injection. Thus, my issue is with implementing the followingp  blockquote   pyou may want to make sure that the Store and Clerk both use   the same CustomerLine instance.p blockquote  pYes, that is exactly what I want to do. emBut how do I do that in a Guice moduleemp  precodepublic class MyModule extends AbstractModule implements Module      Override     protected void configure          Side Question Do I need to do this if there if Boss.class is the implementation         bindBoss.class         bindCustomerLine.class.toDefaultCustomerLine.class impl       codepre  pI create an injector with my modulep  precodeInjector injector  Guice.createInjectornew MyModule codepre  pNow, I want an instance of codeStorecodep  precodeStore store  injector.getInstanceStore.class codepre  pThis will inject a new instance of codeCustomerLinecode and codeBosscode into this instance of codeStorecode. codeBosscode, however, gets an instance of codeClerkcode which also gets injected an instance of codeCustomerLinecode.

Negative 1602 pI am trying to make a class called codeFoocode like object in JavaScript that would let me create multiple instances of codeFoocode. By multiple instances, I mean, each instance would maintain separate internal state. This is how I am achieving it.p  precodevar Foo  function      function inita          this.a  a           function state          return this.a           function getFoo          return              init init,             state state                    return          getFoo getFoo        var a  Foo.getFoo var b  Foo.getFoo a.init10 b.init20 alerta.state  ,   b.state codepre  pAs you can see that the codeFoo.getFoocode seems to simulate the Factory pattern usually used in Java. The internal state is the variable codethis.acode. I consider my attempt a success because codea.statecode and codeb.statecode display two different internal states. However, this is purely my attempt without any knowledge of how these things are implemented in the industry.p  pNow, my questions may seem like a request for code review and is at the risk of getting closed, so I will try to make my questions as objective as possible.p  ol liHow can the same code be implemented such that codenewcode operator can be used instead to create the new instances of a class with codethis.acode as the internal stateli liHow is my code with the factory  pattern written in the industryli ol

Great but nowp  pLets say that Ur table gets updated a lot and ur adding names and U get more entries with the same LastName , but U dont want all of them Rows to get deleted with this LastName.p  pIs it possible to write the Delete statement in such a way that the variable for LastName is Editable or Changeable What I mean is for example being able to Change LastName to Age for example or Any other variable I have in the table that I want to use instead to execute delete with, without having to do so in my php script, but simply from the app. page itself.p  pSo the actions u would take with such a code would be navigating to the Delete tab in this app, Changing the variable u want to use to make ur search for delete with, through typing or a drop down list for example and eventually press delete for execute.p  pIm thinking something like this for examplep  precode if mysqliquerycon,DELETE FROM persons WHERE variablelta href Select2Delete.phpgt codepre  pAnd so I would be able to fill in the variable corresponding to my table collumns I want to search by to delete.p  pI have been looking  checkboxes and auto increment and ways about doing this differently, but I want to know if this is possible first since I find it an easy way to make the script work compared to having to set up a table that first looks up the data and then add checkboxes with a delete button with a load of If Statements to execute a delete by selecting a box feel mep  pAny advice, comment, remark is welcome This is a Pure thought that I want to share and ask ur opinion aboutp  pThank you in advanced Cheers to this forump

Negative 1602 pI have a system that controls a medical office agenda. I need to use the backtracking algorithm if the doctor cancel the appointments of the day. The algorithm must reschedule the cancelled appointments in another date and hour, based on the preferences of patients schedules week day and hour. It must return true just if all the cancelled appointments were rescheduled. If one or more fails it must try again until theres no solution left. Can anyone explain me how I should use the algorithm to solve this Or give me some helpful links Im trying search for it on google and here but with no success.p  pThanksp

Negative 1602 pThis is my first post on stack overflow. So I am inexperienced in programming, but I take an interest in C and Tscopelibrary. Anyway I have been trying to make some simple experiments by myself. However, I have a trouble about bitmap image presentation. p  pIn my test experiment, participants see one image s1.bmp for example for six times in each trial total 5 trials. Participants can see the image for the duration they like until they press the SPACE key. Ultimately, I will use 2 images in each trial and ask participants to see those images alternately, and at the end of trial, to determine which one do they like the more. However in this case it is not important for my trouble, so I ask participants only to see one image repeatedly with the SPACE key.p  pMy trouble is that In some trials images appear and clear with flickering not in all trials. And curiously, this trouble only occurs in FULLSCREEN mode. Ive checked some setting values, but refresh rate and resolutions seem to not involve. I also changed PC and ran the experiment, but it was not the factor.p  pHow can I clear such flickeringp  pIt would be nice if someone help me.

Negative 1602 pIs there a way to implement functionality so that a user can Right click a subsection of an Html page say a DIV or other container element so that that part can be saved as an imagepdf using javascriptp  pAlternatively ideally  can this be done on the server side in ASP.NETp  pThe use case for this is the followingp  pI have some complex web pages generated in asp.NET and using the javscript Flot library for the graphs.  I would like to reuse part of the html page to generate PDF reports or at least image snapshots which can easily be inserted into reports.  I have looked around and it seems there is a tool wkhmltopdf which converts the entire page to PDF, however there are 2 issuesp  ol liThis tool needs to be run separately, which is not friendly for end usersli liThe tool extracts everything on the page, e.g. menus headers , footers etc.li ol  pFor the second problem I could generate web pages without the headersfooters and menus, and then use the tool, but this does not solve problem 1.  Ideally I would like to generate the report weekly and automatically so the user only needs to download it.p  pFor this purpose what is really needed is some way to  store as pdf or image a DIV or other element referenced by id.  This way I would not need to write separate code to generate the reports.  I realize there will be a loss of quality converting html to PDF, but for our purposes, this is not that important.p

Negative 1602 pIm following the jcrop rails tutorial, but Ive hit a snag. What it comes down to is the fact that paperclip is generating the thumbnail from the original file, but I need it to be generated from another style.

Negative 1602 pstrongCstrongp  pGiven a base class codeBasecode and a derived class codeDerivedcode, the first thing constructed by codeDerivedcodes constructor is the codeBasecode subobject. Since its called a subobject, I assumed it can be accessed from client code like any other member object by using the dot operator on the codeDerivedcode object. I also assumed it can be accessed from codeDerivedcodes implementation code by codethisgtBasecode. A statement comprised entirely of the name of an object that has already been initialized followed by a semicolon should compile but also have no effect. Following that logic, given a codeDerivedcode object codemyderivedcode, I tried codemyderived.Basecode in client code and codethisgtBasecode in codeDerivedcodes implementation and neither statement compiles.p  pWhy I know codeBasecode, by itself, is the name of the codeBasecode class and not of a codeBasecode object. But I thought codeBasecode qualified by the codemyderived.code client code or codethisgtcode implementation code prefix refers to the base subobject because codeBasecode, without any prefix qualifications, is the way the codeBasecode subobject is referred to in codeDerivedcodes constructor initializer. Refer to the below code, which commentedout code aside works in VC12 and g 4.8. codeDerivedcode extends codeBasecode and codeDerivedcodes definition declares a codeBasecode data member codemembasecode, so my codeDerivedcode object should contain two codeBasecode objects. Assuming the successful compilation isnt the result of any compilerStandardnonconformity, the console output in the comments, which shows different values for the codeintcode members codencode for the two different codeBasecode objects, implies that in codeDerivedcodes ctor initializer, codeBasecode refers to the inherited codeBasecode subobject whereas codemembasecode refers to the declared data member object. In codeDerivedcodes ctor initializer, codeBasecode refers specifically to the inherited subobject, not just any codeBasecode object nor the codeBasecode class.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  struct Base      Baseint par  npar      void foo  stdcout ltlt Base  ltlt n ltlt stdendl      int n   struct Derived  Base      Derived  Base2, membase3      Base membase     void foo  stdcout ltlt Derived  ltlt n ltlt stdendl        void g  thisgtBase   Error in VC12 amp g 4.8       VC12 error C2273 functionstyle cast  illegal as      right side of gt operator   int main      Derived myderived       myderived.Base Error in VC12 amp g 4.8       VC12 error C2274 functionstyle cast  illegal as      right side of . operator      myderived.foo            OUTPUT Derived 2     myderived.Basefoo      OUTPUT Base 2     myderived.membase.foo    OUTPUT Base 3  codepre  ol lipAgain, shouldnt codemyderived.Basecode or codethisgtBasecode uniquely refer to the inherited codeBasecode subobject and compilepli lipDoes the codeBasecode in codemyderived.Basecode or codethisgtBasecode refer to the codeBasecode subobject or the codeBasecode class or anything at allpli lipIn general, are inherited base subobjects considered data members of derived classespli lipFrom the perspective of codeDerivedcode, does codeBasecode only refer to the inherited subobject within the context of codeDerivedcodes constructor initializer and only refer to the codeBasecode class outside codeDerivedcodes ctor initializerpli lipHow can I access the inherited codeBasecode subobject through the codeDerivedcode object, as in, how can I express the inherited codeBasecode subobject of the codeDerivedcode object in codeDerivedcodes implementation code and in client codepli lipThe use of the scope resolution operator in codemyderived.Basefoocode, where codefoocode is a method of codeBasecode, compiles in VC12 and g 4.8. Does this mean codeBasecode is a data member of codemyderivedcode, since it is qualified by codemyderivedcode and the dot operator If so, then is that codeBasecode the codeBasecode class or the codeBasecode subobjectpli lipBut codemyderived.Base.foocode doesnt compile. AFAIK access of an objects member is qualified in client code by the object name and dot operator. Two kinds of things that are qualified by the scope resolution operator, instead of the object name and dot operator, are a outside access to anything that belongs to a namespace and b the names of static data members and names of member functions of definitions defined outside their class definition, in which case the codeBasecode that precedes the codecode refers to the codeBasecode class, not any codeBasecode instance. Does this mean the codeBasecode in codemyderived.Basecode is a namespace or refers to the classpli lipIf so, then is its being a namespace or referring to the class conditional upon whether it is appended by a codecode followed by a member of codeBasecodepli lipIf the answer to 7 is yes, then why It would seem incongruous with the following logic a namespaces enclosure of one variable does not in itself enable the namespace to enclose or construct other instances of the variables type. The namespace only owns one instance of that typethe variable it encloses. The same goes for a member that is part of a class, as in, static data member. The class only owns one instance of that typethe static data member it encloses. In contrast, there are as many samenamed nonstatic data members of a class as there are instances of the class.pli lipGiven method codehcode of codeBasecode and a codeDerivedcode object codemyderivedcode, codemyderived.Basehcode compiles in VC12 and g 4.8.

Such a statement seems to imply codeBasecode is a member of codeBasecode. But VC12 gives codeerror C3083 ctor the symbol to the left of a  must be a typecode. But given codeBasecode object codemybasecode, VC12 compiles codemybase.Basehcode just fine, which would also imply VC12 is fine with treating a class as a member of itself. But that contradicts its inability to compile the prior statement. Also, VC12 cannot compile any version of codemybase.Basehcode that has any number of extra codeBasecodes e.g. codemybase.BaseBasehcode, but g can. Which compiler is correct, if anypli lipIn any case, does that mean a namespace or class can contain itself Given a global codeintcode variable codexcode, the statement codexcode with two scope resolution operators doesnt compile in either compiler, so Im assuming the global scope doesnt contain the global scope.pli ol

I would like to use Python and webdriver to go to this url a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWebDriverSeleniumWebDriver relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWebDriverSeleniumWebDrivera and highlight the second sentence under the heading Selenium WebDriver Selenium WebDriver accepts commands sent in Selenese, or via a Client API and sends them to a browser. p  pThe tricky thing is that I was hoping that this could be done without using any elements, and Ive been trying to work out a way to click at a location specified by x and y coordinates and then hold moving to another location, specified by a different set of x and y coordinates. p  pFrom reading around, I understand that it is not possible to just click on an area of the page by coordinates as you need to specify an element, so can the text selection be done only using only a single, remote element lets say .mweditsectiona I was thinking it might be possible be able to do it by using the element as a reference and clicking a certain distance away from it i.e. click by offset.p  pThis is what Ive attempted so far, but its not doing the jobp  precodefrom selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.actionchains import ActionChains  driver  webdriver.Firefox actions  ActionChainsdriver driver.gethttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWebDriverSeleniumWebDriver  theonlyelement  .mweditsectiongta element  driver.findelementbycssselectortheonlyelement  actions.movetoelementwithoffsetelement,50,50 actions.clickandholdonelementNone actions.movebyoffset50, 50 actions.release actions.perform codepre  pFrom this, I get this errorp  precodeWebDriverException Message uUnknownError Cannot press more then one button or an already pressed button. when calling method [wdIMousedown]  codepre  h2Backgroundh2  pI appreciate that the above example is a bit contrived, but I cant actually provide you with the thing Im really trying to test. What Im actually doing is writing a series of tests in Python using webdriver to test our document viewer, and I really need to be able to highlight a row of text as this is how you add comments on our system. Unfortunately, the document viewer doesnt actually show the submitted document, only an image of it via some kind of javascript wizardry. The document page is an element, but there are no elements for webdriver to click on within the page itself.p  pBecause of this, I want to be able to click and hold on a location on the page by specifying coordinates at the start of the sentence, keep the mouse button held while the mouse curser is simulated moving to the right to a second set of coordinates at the end of the sentence, and then release the button. p  h2TLDRh2  pIs it possible to click and drag from an arbitrary point on a webpage to another, without using an element other than to act as a reference from which the arbitrary point is defined as being offset from p  pIf not, what other method could you suggest to highlight an area of text and could you provide a working examplep  pThanksp
Negative 1602 pI am writing a game using libgdx, and I borrowed the skin.json and related files from a tutorial.p  pThe font being used default was scaling in an ugly manner on denser screens, so I generated by own very large font  and in the game itself, I scale it to a reasonable size basically I use codeBitmapFont.scalecode. The font Im now using is 3 times as large as the previous one.p  pI changed the reference to which font to use in the skin.json file, and as a result, all my buttons, titles and other things have a massive font being shown.p  pIs there a way of scaling the font in the .json file Or anywhere else in the code Skin doesnt have a codesetFontcode functionality, so I cant create a scaled BitmapFont and assign itp

Negative 1602 pI have java code which is collecting about 100 events per minute. I have to pass these events to R code in turn R code may call back to my java code. I donot like to send them in batches and would like to hand over the messages to R code as soon as they are collected.br 1based on my understanding so far, RServe can help Java code call R code. Can I use RServe also for callback to my Java code from R 2Can JRI instead serve my purpose where Java code can call R and R in turn can do callback to Java 3say I want to write my 100 events to file not serialization, just write them as text. Is there a package in R that can act as file watcher which gets called as soon as file is modified similar to java.nio.FileWatchp  pwhat is the recommended approach given some of above possible ways of doing it. I am not looking for one time call, but it is going to be about 100 R calls from java to R with possible callbacks. thanks for looking into this questionp

It works nicely except in one scenario, when resizing from a smaller width to a larger width screen.p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltiframe classiframeclass srchttpwww.cnn.comgtltiframegt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.container      width 100     height 250px  .iframeclass      width 100     height 100     border 1px solid red     overflow auto  codepre  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  precodefunction       setIFrameSize     window.resizefunction           setIFrameSize        function setIFrameSize      var ogWidth  700     var ogHeight  600     var ogRatio  ogWidth  ogHeight      var windowWidth  window.width     if windowWidth lt 480          var parentDivWidth  .iframeclass.parent.width         var newHeight  parentDivWidth  ogRatio         .iframeclass.addClassiframeclassresize         .iframeclassresize.csswidth, parentDivWidth         .iframeclassresize.cssheight, newHeight      else           .iframeclassresize.removeAttrwidth          .iframeclassresize.removeAttrheight         .iframeclass.removeClassiframeclassresize       codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTBJ83 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTBJ83ap  pstrongProblemstrong As the window is resized smaller, it continually checks the window width and once it hits lt 480 px, the code adds a class called codeiframeclassresizecode and sets the width and height to that class. As the window is resized larger, it removes the class once the size hits 480 px. The problem is that setting the width and height attributes adds them directly to the element and not the class itself. Therefore, removing the class does not remove the new width and heights. I tried to force removing the attributes using coderemoveAttrcode commented out above but that didnt work.p  pAnyone see where the code above went wrong Or any suggestions on how to accomplish having a responsive iframe more effectively The main things that are required are that the iframe has to be inside the codeltdivgtltdivgtcode and the div may not necessarily have a width or height defined. Ideally, the parent div should have the width and height explicitly defined but the way this site is currently setup, that wont always be possible.p  pstrongAdditionalstrong In case the above wasnt clear enough, try the following to reproduce the issuep  ul liOpen up a browser on a desktop machine. Im using Chrome on a Windows machine. Dont maximize the browser.li liOpen up the jsfiddle above a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTBJ83 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTBJ83a.

The goal is to have that iframe content to regain the entire width of the Preview panel. Instead, the content is retaining the resized width and height since the code.csscode function applies css changes directly to elements rather than to the classes.li ul  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1602 pWe have a need to build an EXE app that runs on a customers server that accesses our MultiTenant SQL database.p  pWe have a Column SubscriberId for each table that we use in our web app to limit users to just the records that belong to their SubscriberId  which works perfectly fine on our servers.p  pWe have an Exchange to SQL service that runs on our server that syncs Exchange Contacts and Appointments to our SQL tables. An issue is that we need customers to grant us the Exchange ApplicationImpersonation role for us to access the data on their server  which means we have access to their whole Exchange database store.p  pMost customers have been willing to allow us that access level, but a few dont want us to have that level of access  and thats understandable.p  pOur sync app is a C .NET console app, and we want to adapt it so we can have endusers install the app on their server and have it sync with our server remotely.p  pTHE QUESTION Is is possible to create a user on SQL Server 2008R2 that only has access to the rows for that user filtered WHERE SubscriberId  201 for example.p  pWe would allow port 1433 access to their server and the userpassword would be used in the connection string in the App.config.p  pIf so, we can create an admin panel in an Windows exe app where they setup that SQL Userpassword and their Exchange SuperUser. Then they can remotely sync  but only see their own records in our SQL database.p  pOtherwise, it seems we would need to rework the app to use an API and an alternate security scheme. That would obviously be a lot more work p  pThanks, Charlesp
Negative 1602 pI need a Regular Expression for the following.       I need to validate a textbox in which it is storing country code. It should contain a  sign at the starting and after that it should contain max 4 digit. So total including  sign not max then 5 digit. And in the other textbox it stores the mobile no in which there should be max 14 digit but even lesser than 14 are allowed.p  pI looked around the problem but cant find the solution to it so can you please help me out which works with both the different text box in a single regular expression as soon as possible.p
Negative 1602 pI have data that I want to summarize in a single report with six subreportsp  ul liPotential sales by departmentli liActual sales by departmentli liPotential sales by regionli liActual sales by regionli liPotential sales by sales associateli liActual sales by sales associateli ul  pEach of these shows the by department, region, associate in one column and the sales value in the second column. The report itself is unbound, but called by a form that I also use to call a detail report showing data for each individual sale. I want to be able to use many of the same filters such as department, office location, range of sales dates, etc. on the summary form that I use for filtering the details.p  pBecause the subreports use GROUP BY, its impossible to query them in such a way that I can include filter values in the Filter property. I would have to include them in the Record Source property.p  pMy current attempt has been to pass the values from the form to fields on the report that I can reference in the queries of the subreports, but this doesnt seem to be working. I also tried passing a filter string to the report that I programmatically pass to the queries underlying the subreports, but the report wont take a filter string and Im currently using OpenArgs to pass a custom value for the header of the report.p  pIm not convinced this is the best way to solve my problem, so Im open to alternative solutions so long as it gets me the same end product.p
Negative 1602 pIm using perl raw sockets to send a large number of arbitrary raw packets nothing malicious, but I only get about 14500 going out before my send call fails with No buffer space available.p  pIm guessing that something in the kernel is keeping track of what Im sending  How can I prevent that.  I just want to send each packet, there is no necessity to wait for replies or remember anything about what got sent.  Update I notice loads of CLOSEWAIT entries in my netstat command  how do I tell the kernel not to do thatp  pWhat is the buffer space its referring to, and is there a way to check what space emisem available, so I can avoid sending more when theres no room  Alternatively  is there a way to block on send, so I never experience the errorp  pAlternatively  is there some other way to send out an ethernet packet eg a SYN, where the kernel knows not to enter anything into any tablesp

Negative 1602 pIm not sure if each hardware type display screen, USB, printer, etc has to follow a unified standard in order to communicate with the CPU. For example, the bits transmitted back and forth between a display screen interface and the CPU are interpreted by the CPU as a specific command, and this interpretation is also correct for the same bits even if another display screen is used from another manufacturer.p  pIf this is not true, how BIOS is supposed to communicate with hundreds of different hardware devices with varying methods of interpreting bits going back and forth from the device interface to the CPUp  pI find the standardization notion to be much more practical.p

Negative 1602 pIm working on a game right now thats basically like Connect 4, but with letters instead of colored checkers. The player drops a letter tile into the grid, and can then claim a word if that letter is the one he played. The word is then checked to see if its actually in the grid which is an array of structs that contain a letter value char and a boolean value to determine whether the tile is empty. I have successfully coded the human players turn, i.e. the one that takes user input. The computer turn, is turning out to be very problematic. p  pThe computer player should look at the letter tiles it has remaining each player has a string containing every letter in the alphabet with an extra set of vowels every time a player plays a tile, that respective tile is erased from the string, and then choose it to drop it into a column that would give it the largest amount of points the length of the word correlates with the amount of points.p  pRight now, my Human Code goes a little like this Input Letter  Input Desired Row  Game checks to see if the lowest row of that column is open  The tile is placed in the lowest available row of the column  Player is asked if he would like to claim a word  Player inputs a word  Game checks every row, column, and diagonal line to check that the word is in the grid  Game checks that the word contains the letter that was just used  Game checks a dictionary a text file to see if the word is a valid word that it is in the dictionary  Human player is awarded points correlating to the length of the word.p  pSo, for the computer players turn, I figured that I should start by looking for words that are seven letters long. However, I have no idea how to do this. I have a large multitude of strings that I can use to check words up against the string hstr1 is the first row of the grid, vstr1 is the first column of the grid, and dstr1 would be the first diagonal line of letters, from the top left to the bottom right. p  pWhat Im trying to do, is to be able to make the program look at the grid, and think Are there any incomplete words that could be completed with a letter I have remaining in my letter choice string I would of course start it for looking for words that are seven letters long or six since the word should be one letter short of complete, and then if it cannot find any seven letter words, then go down to six, and five, until there are no three letter words claimable. p  pIve made a load of progress in coding this game, but this is the one thing that has stumped me completely. If anyone could help me come up with some pseudocode for this, I would greatly, greatly appreciate it. I dont really have anywhere else to turn for help, and this game is due in five days.p

Negative 1602 pI am trying to create a JTabbedPane so that the final tab is actually a button that will open up a dialog box to add something to the tabbed pane.  I tried looking around the source for JTabbedPane, but I cant find where the tab objects the row of clickable buttons that when clicked change the currently visible component actually are.  There is a private list of Page objects so they cant be accessed by child classes anyway but they only contain the info about the tab and arent the tab object themselves.  My goal is to be able to add a button that comes after the tab list horizontally.p  pI also tried using JTabbedPane.setTabComponentAt to change the string of the final tab to a JButton with a component of null, but that still adds the tab component.  If you click slightly to the rightleft of the button in the tab, a blank tab will show because theres always padding around the component.  Perhaps theres a way to get rid of this  But I suppose in some Look and Feels that have tabs like this  instead of this  you could still click in the tab but not click the button.p  pDoes anyone know how I can get what Im looking for without writing my own version of JTabbedPanep  pThanksp

The problem is I cant manage to get my data back to the Fortran main program in an 2D allocatable array I tried to code a simple program for passing a dynamic array allocated in a C subroutine, which is called by my main Fortran program, in order to see if I can get access to the data when Im out of the C subroutine.p  pHere is my small code p  pstrongFortran mainstrongp  precodePROGRAM FORTC  use isocbinding IMPLICIT NONE  interface     subroutine callfcpX,s bindC,namecallfc         import         integercint               s         typecptr, allocatable     pX     end subroutine end interface  integercint                               i integercint, pointer                      X typeCptr, allocatable                     pX   call callfcpX,100 call cfpointerpX,X,[100]  END codepre  pstrongC subroutinestrongp  precodeinclude ltcstdlibgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  extern C       void callfcint x, int s     void cfuncdeallocateint x    void callfcint x, int s      int i     x  int  mallocsizeofints     fori0ilt100i              cout ltlt i ltlt endl         x[i]i        void cfuncdeallocateint x      freex  codepre  pThis is really simple, but I get this strongoutputstrongp  precode0 1 forrtl severe 174 SIGSEGV, segmentation fault occurred Image              PC                Routine            Line        Source              exemple            000000000040304C  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown exemple            0000000000402F25  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown exemple            0000000000402ECC  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown libc.so.6          000000331241ECDD  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown exemple            0000000000402DC9  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown codepre  pI dont understand why I get this when i1 I hope I was clear on my problem, can someone help please p  pThanks a lot p

Negative 1602 pIm at the planning stages of adding some functionality to a CMS. Kind of new to the Graph API, so excuse any blatant ignorance.p  pAt any given time, there are more than 1000 sitesdomains that use the system. The plan is to create a single app, with an APP ID, and secret  and then have the users authenticate themselves. p  pWhat Im having trouble grasping is the required entries for app domains, and OAuth redirect URIs on the app dashboard. Since many domains will be using the app, how is that handled I found a somewhat related post here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9596194facebookapikeyforanopensourcecmsFacebook API key for an open source CMSap  pSomeone suggested the creation of a loopback server to handle the requests. So would be the best method to create a separate domain on the system, and funnel everything through that..something like facebook.mysite.com p

Negative 1602 pI am having a little trouble doing something that is supposed to be very simple.  I cannot get the floor of my tiles to display above a background picture. However I can get all my other game objects to show from my control pad, to my HUD to even coins and monsters set up in the same tile map. Basically everything appears in front the background like I expect the floor of my tilemap so it looks like im walking on air. I have tried many things like changing which layer i add the background picture or the tilemap floor too, or even tried setting it the same way i set my characters but same results. Tilemap floor is always at the back. Adding my Set up code, Hope it is helpful too solving the problem.p  pI created this BG sprite since, I wanted my tilemap to scroll vertically or horzi. automatically. So the easiest way I found to do that was to make the tilemap the child of the bg and scroll the bg hence scrolling the tile map. However, I have tried setting the background as the child of the bg and setting the Z for both of them but that didnt seem to help.

Negative 1602 pDoes anyone know how to crop an image with spritekit for iOS using an irregular shape node The problem is when I do an skcrop on it, the shape has 2 layers, and thus the cropping fails. To crop one must use a single layer. Any idea how to rasterize a shape first, before the scene is loaded Ive tried skeffectnode and shouldRasterize on it but that fails too, most likely because it contains 2 children as well, or the rasterization is occuring after the scene is loaded. Ive also tried converting the shape to a texture, but that fails for the same reasons as the skeffectnode does. Ive looked at other possible solutions on stack overflow, and none seem to work or are very limited to squares, so Im thinking this is a bug that must exist only in iOS7, so please dont say this is a duplicate without letting me check out the duplicate first to make sure that it really is one.p  pRight now all signs point to not using an skshapenode with a fill to crop an image.p

I could do something simple like having two proceduresp  precodeuspSaveCar DELETE FROM Cars WHERE ID  ID INSERT INTO Cars VALUES ID, Color  uspSavePassenger DELETE FROM Passengers WHERE ID  ID INSERT INTO Passengers VALUES ID, CarID, Name codepre  pId call this using a transaction by calling uspSaveCar to save the car and then calling uspSavePassenger to save each passenger associated with that car.  Note Passengers can be added or subtracted from the car and then resaved.p  pThis will work for a single thread.  The application, however, will be distributed.

I want to avoid race conditions as well as deadlocks.  I want to make sure User 1 saves the car entirely, including all passengers, before User 2 can begin saving the car and passengers.  ie Only one of the 2 users instances of carpassengers should exist and it should match their entity not be polluted by the other users update  One of the two saves the one happening first will be overwritten immediately and thats fine as long as the second save is proper and complete.p  pFrom my research, I could use Cs TransactionScope which would allow me to lock rows for a transaction during which I call several stored procedures.  My plan would bep  precodeStart a new transaction with an appropriate isolation level     Call a procedure to update the car probably using a MERGE as the car may or may not exist     Call a procedure to delete and reinsert all passenger records for the car.

The problem is, the ajax file upload appears to require its own form, meaning that I need to have a form within a form, which is apparently no bueno.p  pHow can I rejigger my form so that I can have the file uploader within the bounds of the form,  yet not break everythingp  pEdit code snippetp  precodeltform actionltphp echo escurlSERVER[PHPSELF] gt        methodpost        nameformgt  Username ltinput typetext                  nameusername                  idusername gtltbrgt Email ltinput typetext                nameemail               idemail gtltbrgt Password ltinput typepassword                namepassword                 idpasswordgtltbrgt Admin ltinput typecheckbox                nameadmin                idadmin gtltbrgt File Upload ltform methodpost enctypemultipartformdata  actionupload.phpgt   ltinput typefile nameimages[] idimages[] multiple gt   ltbutton typesubmit idbtngtUpload Filesltbuttongt ltformgt  ltdiv idresponsegtltdivgt ltul idimagelistgt ltulgt ltbutton idclear onclickclearImgsgtClearltbuttongtltbrgt ltinput typehidden idimgname valuegt ltinput typehidden namenewuser idnewuser gt ltbrgt ltinput typebutton         valueRegister         onclickreturn regformhashthis.form,                                    this.form.username,                                    this.form.email,                                    this.form.password gt  ltformgt codepre

Negative 1602 pI am having a peculiar issue involving Microsoft SQL Server 2012. We are taking a table with a large set of data and copying it to another table where it will later be run through a series of stored procedures. We are using an codeINSERT INTO SELECTcode statement to copy the data from one table to the other.p  pWe transfer data often using this process and it is usually very fast. However, we just encountered one set of data that seems to be taking significantly longer to copy. There are no more rows in the table than usual. We are baffled as to what would make this one particular set of data copy slower than others since there is nothing physically different about this data other than the values of the fields in each row. p  pOne thing to note is that this data is actually different than most that we process in that it originally was in a table in SQL Server 2008 before we brought it into SQL Server 2012 to be processed. We attempted to run the same queries on that data on the 2008 server and we experienced no performance issues. p  pWe are unsure about the root of this problem and are unsure where to begin to resolve this. If anybody has ever experienced this or has any advice that would be great.p

Negative 1602 pI need to have some kind of object that acts like a BroadcastBlock, but with guaranteed delivery. So i used an answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22127660broadcastblockwithguaranteeddeliveryintpldataflowthis questiona. But i dont really clearly understand the execution flow here.

But all actionblocks that receive the number can run in parallel. p  pSo here is the questionp  pIn the output i can see different thread ids. Do i understand it correctly that works as followsp  pExecution hits codeawait block.SendAsyncnumcode in a broadcaster.  If current block is not ready to accept the number, execution exits broadcaster and hangs at the Task.WaitAll.  When block accepts the number, the rest of foreach statement in broadcaster is executed in a threadpool.  And the same till the end.  Each iteration of foreach is executed in a threadpool. But actually it happens sequentially.p  pAm i right or wrong in my understanding How can i change this code to send the number to all blocks asynchronously p  pTo make sure that if one of blocks is not ready to receive the number at the moment, i wont wait for it and all others that are ready will receive the number. And that all blocks can run in parallel. And guarantee delivery.p

It should output e.g. 1 if the values are as uniformly as possible and 0 if all x[i] are the same.p  pThe problem now is that the algorithm has to work with n beging much lower than and also much higher than m.p  pThank youp

Negative 1602 pIm trying to write this program that uses looping where it finds Brute Force Prime Numbers using Mersenne. The direction is as follows.p  blockquote   blockquote     blockquote       blockquote         pA prime number is a number that is not evenly divisible by any other number except,       trivially, 1. All known methods of determining whether a number is a prime number rely on brute force, that is, exhaustive testing of the possibilities. Write a routine that checks whether a number is prime. Check if its even, and if not, check all the odd numbers up to the square root of the number do you see why the square root is enough. If the number is not prime, tell the user one factor.p                  pFor you demo, youll use Mersenne 67, which is 2 to the 67th power minus 1 see problem 14A 147573952589676412927 [147,573,952,589,676,412,927]. In 1644, Marin Mersenne conjectured this number was prime. It was not until 1903 that F.N. Cole resolved this conjecture, for which he received a standing ovation at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society. What was the resolution i.e., is Mersenne 67 prime Use your program to answer this question your program will probably run for about 2 minutes, quite an advance over the 2 centuries it originally took to resolve the issue.p       blockquote     blockquote   blockquote blockquote  pThis what what I have so far, but it doesnt seem to run where I can verify my answer.

The problem is embedded container only supports EJB3.1 Lite and those test cases which run on other EJB3.1 features like Timer, Messaging, Remote calls fail. What is the better approach to run my container test cases while still using the Maven scripts I have these scripts integrated into Jenkins environment. So, ideally when my application archive .ear is installed it would have passed all my container test cases.p

Negative 1602 pIm attempting to send a POST request from within an Android app to my Google App Engine app in order to upload a file to the blobstore and some metadata to the Datastore.  I built a regular webform which I can access from a browser, and posting from there works just fine.  However, I havent been able to do the same from my Android app.p  pA lot of other StackOverflow posts mention the use of codeMultipartEntitycode or codeMultipartEntityBuildercode to build the post request.

The uploadurl thats passed into the HttpPost constructor is the very same one thats used in the action field of the web form code uploadurl code its dynamically generated by Google App Engine.  So, I thought Id try posting to any web form, not one that requires multipart entities and dynamic URLs.

By all accounts that Ive read, this ought to work.  Is there something Im forgetting which isnt allowing me to complete the post request  Id really appreciate any help.p

Negative 1602 pOne advantage of codeanycode over codevariantcode is, that one does not need to specify all types, that it may contain. Ive noticed, that as the number of types a codevariantcode may contain grows, people tend to switch to codeanycode at some point, because they simply dont keep track of all the types anymore. I think a hybrid between codeanycode and codevariantcode is possible. One could store the codeplaceholdercode via placement codenewcode of codeanycode in codealignedstoragecode, with the size calculated in a codeconstexprcode function or template metafunction, from a sample of the largest types, that may end up being stored. The user, on the other hand, would not need to specify all the types, that an codeanycode might contain. The codeanycode could also throw at any time, if the user would try to store something larger than the codealignedstoragecode in there.p  pDoes such a codevariantanycode class exist Is there some inherent problem with the ideap

Negative 1602 pI want to use jQuery for nested getElementsByTagName. Many questions deal with nested each, but they veer off into special topics. I cant figure out something that is probably very simple. In pure JavaScript I havep  precodetables  document.getElementsByTagNametable for var t  0 t lt tables.length t      thisTable  tables[t]     if thisTable.id  specialID              inputs  thisTable.getElementsByTagNameinput         for var r0 r lt inputs.length r                      thisInput  inputs[r]             if thisInput.type  radio                              if thisInput.checked  true                                      [do stuff]                     break                                              codepre  pBasically this does some testing on certain radio buttons inside of a desired table. The syntax of the nested getElementByTagName is what is causing me problems when I try to convert to jQuery.

But the second each on inputs doesnt select any of the input controls inside a particular table.

What is the right way to form the syntax that lets me iterate over all the inputs inside one of all the tablesp
Negative 1602 pI would like to build an appwebsite which displays a KML File or at least some simple 3D models for google cardboard but I havent found any way to do so. The idea would be to have some kind of immersive app to view the 3D models. It seems that there is no way to display a Google Aarth view in an app or webpage on Android, and that I cant reuse the Google Earth view in the Cardboard app to display a KML file. Do you have any idea how to do sop  pThanksp

Negative 1602 pI have a case where I am compiling a dynamic regex based on client code input, and it works except for when I run my multithreaded unit test 1001000 times. When I run it with 1 thread, it never fails. When I run it with 2 or 4 threads it fails at this rare frequency. Except on my build server, where it seems to fail most of the time, which is how I learned about the issue to begin with. Its not crashing though, its just very rarely returning the wrong results, and not always in the same place in the unit test. So Im trying to understand Xpressives thread safety. I understand it as far as not using a regex object in multiple threads until its finished compiling and not sharing a matchresults across threads, but what about compiling different regex objects for each thread if two threads are compiling two different regexes or even the same const regex string but from different threads, is that ok Im seeing this failure on MSVC 12 but I think I also got it with VC10, just not as reliably on the build server but the build server had to be upgraded to Windows 2012 to install VC12, so maybe that OS change had an effect as well.p

Negative 1602 pI would like to be able to have an API system, in which a POST message that contains a csv file is sent to a serverwebserverdomain name. It is used as an input for an R function, and then outputs a value which is set back to the sender of the POST message.p  pOne of the issues I have is that most of the solutions I have seen such as coderApachecodea hrefhttprapache.net relnofollowhttprapache.neta invoke R to run a script, and take back the output. The problem is that my R script also loads from disk some very large data files, which are used as further inputs in order to create the final output.p  pIf running R from the console, with the large data files already loaded as well as all the relevant libraries, the final part of loading up the user input csv, running the function and creating an output is reasonably quick. I.e. for each POST request, it seems highly inefficient to keep reinvoking R loading all relevant files and then closing it after creating the output. I.e. having R constantly running with all the relevant files and libraries and finally only loading in the given CSV file to run the final calculations seems much more efficient...Is there a way to do thisp  pcodeShinycode a hrefhttpshiny.rstudio.com relnofollowhttpshiny.rstudio.coma looks like a close solution since it always has R running in the background and may be able to take in POST requests, but it also has a lot of unnecessary overhead which probably makes it too inefficient for my purposes.p  pAlso will this method be able to handle many POST messages coming in simultaneouslyp  pAs always any help is always much appreciated.

Negative 1602 pIm rendering a geodesic sphere of radius 1 in OpenGL and in my glsl tesselation shader multiplying the vertex by a value from a height displacement map which creates some large rays protruding from the sphere. I am looking for a way to be able to clearly see the geometry this creates. Some diffuse lighting or outlining or something like a sobel filter would be ideal, but I am having trouble calculating the normals needed to apply the lighting or outlining.p  pI was able to calculate the surface normals in a geometry shader, but this created an un acceptable bottleneck as even with it mostly just being a passthrough shader the large number of polygons bogged the gs down. I am stuck with OpenGL 4.2 so nVidias passthrough extension is unavailable to me.p  pI was thinking maybe a pre computed normal map might be the way to go, but I am not sure how to generate that based on my equirectangular projection displacement map.

Negative 1602 pIm developing an app specifically a game for iOS 7 using SpriteKit for the game itself and UIKit for the surrounding user interfaces. Furthermore, Im interested in integrating Admob into the game probably a banner at the bottom of every UIViewController and thus at the bottom of every screen. Im using a storyboard to lay out all the interfaces.p  pNow that Ive gotten to the stage where Id like to integrate Admob, Ive run into a few issues that I cant seem to resolvep  ol liAccording to a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com1371iadtutorialforioshowtointegrateiadintoyouriphoneapp relnofollowthis tutoriala, I should have a content view inside of the root view of my UIViewController. This should in theory allow me to add and remove the ad view which would be a sibling of and below the content view when adds are received and not received, respectively. This would theoretically, as I understand it, allow the content view to resize dynamically to make optimal use of screen real estate. Is this design correct for integrating Admob with storyboard Is there a better way to do itli liPresuming that the line of logic presented in point 1 is correct, I tried to implement it. However, I ran into issues with that as well. I created a test project to get the minimum amount of  code I could that still contained the problem and here is what I got ul liMy goal was to have a nested contentView inside the root view, set the top, left, and right constraints on that view to bind it to those edges, and then dynamically set the size at runtime. I didnt set the bottom constraint of the contentView because I thought that since I had to conditionally set the size of the content view based on whether or not an ad was received, I couldnt bind the bottom of the contentView to any other view I actually did add a bottom constraint to keep Interface Builder happy, but told it to remove that constraint at runtime. I also added a button in the middle of the contentView with centering constraints to keep it there so I could tell whether or not it was working. For a simple test, I decided that I would set the contentView to fill the screen at runtime just to make sure that that basic test would work correctly. However, it failedli ulli ol  pSetup of project img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHszfX.png altSetup of projectp  pResult on iPhone 4S running iOS 8p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comXX1bq.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXX1bqm.jpg altResult on iPhone 4S running iOS 8ap  pCode that was used to set the contentView which was referenced as an IBOutlet size in this case, to the entire screen at runtime on view loadp  precodeinterface GameViewController   property nonatomic IBOutlet UIView contentView  end  implementation GameViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.contentView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height    ... end codepre  pBased of the tutorial referenced above as well as other tutorials I have read online, I presume I am supposed to not include the ad view in Interface Builder and instead instantiate and add it as a subview programmatically on view load instead hence the need to dynamically resize the contentView and the lack of a bottom constraint.p  pShould I be following that tutorial regarding how to add Admob ads into an iOS game Am I supposed to use the nested view approach contentView, in this case, or is there a better way Lastly, why does the attempt to size the contentView at runtime not appear to work the UIButton is half off the top of the screen, giving the impression that the contentView has no heightp  pI really appreciate any informationhelp I can get, and I thank you for your time.p  pIf there is anything elseany other screenshots I can provide to help debug this problem, Id be happy to provide them.p

Negative 1602 pI have a strange situation. I have one web server which hosts Dynamics CRM 2013 Web Site and another Web Site for a RESTfull service. Were using the Xrm Client to connect to the Organization.svc of Dynamics CRM 2013.p  pWe have configured SPNs, delegation, etc. All is working. But we have some strange behavior, every request takes 15 seconds to process. The first post is to get the User Id Guid of the user, and the 2nd post is to get the data from the Organization.svc.p  pThe first POST takes 15000ms to process, while other requests following the first POST takes only 20ms. p  pWe created a Console Application with the same code that is behind the RESTfull Service and it takes only 300ms to get all POSTS done. We changed the connectionManagement settings, weve checked the Proxy settings and everything bypassed. p  pWe have another server with the same setup, and there the service works perfect. What I am I missing that it can take that much timep  pFor your information, the Application Pools are separated with a Domain User account. Exact the same settings in Web.Config, ApplicationHost.config, etc. The only difference is the DNS names.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1602 pI do not understand behavior of setuptools well. p  pI have tiny package with some amount of static files generated in fly, using internally Flask framework, for a simple temporary web server. Everything works pretty well locally. I have managed to get setup.py script to work with overloading build command and adding few lines. And now when I use python setup.py install or build, everything works fine. My static files are copied to the right directories inside virtualenv envlibpython3.4sitepackagesmypackage, also file MyPackage0.0.1py3.4.egginfo is generated, and everything just works.p  pBut now I realized that i needwant functionality of installrequires, setuprequires, testrequires, and need to replace my from disutils.core import setup to from setuptools import setup and at that point everything stop working. Instead of coping my static files, setuptools is constructing big binary egg file with everything inside. setup.py stdout is telling me that my files actually are inside, scrolling the binary file in vim also gives me confidence that my files are inside. But neither my scripts or Flask core cannot read them. The open function with given right I think path throwing NotADirectoryError poiting at envlibpython3.4sitepackagesMyPackage0.0.1py3.4.eggmypackagestaticfile.txt. I understand that giving such path should automagicaly unpack egg file and give me content. I can understand my lack of experience, but Flask core is trying to do exactly same thing and fails exactly at the same point. So the question is what am I doing wrong  When I switch back to the distutils.core everything works again. p  pI understand that this is how setuptools works, but being unable to access my static files is not what I desired. I can write workaround for my code, and unpack files in fly, but I do not thing this is the right way. Additionally I probably wont be able to write workarounds for every external package that use my static files e.g. Flask here.p  pI would be grateful for any suggestions, links or tips. I have tried to read distutils and setuptools source files and find some configuration options, but I do not want end user to be forced to install my package with non standard way. What I want to achieve is to type python setup.py install and hide everything inside of my package.p

Negative 1602 pI have tried searching a lot before posting this.p  pI have a MVC sigle page application in which there are some Tabs, which are used to load URLs in Iframeimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3nXLq.jpg altenter image description herep  pThere is a function In JQuery which handles click event of Tabs viz Diagnostics Info, Diagnostics Tests, Device mngt, Tv Set Top etc.p  pThese Tabs load some URLs in Iframe. Application works perfectly fine when opened in chrome etc. But when I run application in IE9 and clicks on TV SetTop Box it refreshes the whole page which ideally should not happen.p  pI checked in the page of TV Set Top Box and find a tag likep  precodeltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetUTF8 gt codepre  pI doubt if this is the reason for refresh of whole page.

Negative 1602 pIve been using KnockoutJS for some time now, mainly on smalltomedium sized projects. However, Im now working on a very large project with many different views of the same data. For example, a product may be displayed to the customer, allowing them to add products to their shopping cart, and also to an administrator, allowing them to edit the product name, price and available stock. I want to be able to use the same model in both cases, but designing a solution with KnockoutJS is proving difficult. Specifically, I am having two issuesp  pI want to be able to reuse certain view functionality without repeating myself. For example, in both the customer and administrator view of products, clicking the product thumbnail displays the product image in fullscreen. Instead of each view containing the same verbose binding code e.g., codeltimg databindeventclickfunction codeToZoomgtcode in both views, I can move the binding information to the model itself. So the above becomes codeltimg databindeventimageEventsgtcode. However, doing the above forces me to include code that responds to user input in my model, which violates the singleresponsibility principle  e.g., the model is reponsible for business logic, not responding to user input. If I decided I wanted an administrator clicking the thumbnail to open an Upload New Image dialog, then Id need to implement a codeimageEventsForAdministratorcode function.p  pIve asked people how they deal with the above, and their answer has been Write two different models. This sounds good until you realise that a product has a lot of embedded logic, and writing two different models forces you to duplicate that logic. Sop  pstrongAccording to KnockoutJS, what is the recommended approach for separating embusiness logicem from emresponding to eventsuserinputemstrongp

Negative 1602 pThis is a restatement of the problem I was experiencing in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29827169howcaniaddthisfunctiontoanarraywithoutitbeingcalledimmediatelymy previous questiona, I think that question suffered from the X,Y problem. I hope this question gets closer to the heart of the issue Im experiencing. See a hrefhttpsgithub.comIronCountySchoolDistrictStudentContactsblobmasterwebrootscriptsstudentcontactsscchange.jsL439 relnofollowscchange.jsa on Github for code.p  h2Problemh2  pI have an array of deferred jQuery objects that Im calling code.whencode on. These are the functions that send POST requests to the server that modify data. The code.whencode call is wrapped in a code.getcode callback. This requests the data fields that Im about to modify, satisfying the authorization requirement. Heres the codep  precode.getadminstudentscontactsscchangephoneTlcForm.htmlfrn001  studentsdcid, function     console.logget callback reached   .when.applyj, phoneAjaxCalls.donefunction       console.logphoneAjaxCalls promises resolved     returnToStudentContacts     codepre  pI am using codephoneAjaxCalls.pushnewPhonetlcPhone,studentsdcidcode to push ajax calls to the array, and newPhone returns an ajax deferred objectp  precodefunction newPhonetlcPhone, studentsdcid      Create new phone     return function          return j.ajax             type POST,             url adminchangesrecorded.white.html,             data tlcPhone                    codepre  pWhen this code is run, I see in the Console that get callback reached is printed embeforeem phoneAjaxCalls promises resolved, which suggests that the requests are getting sent in the order that they are shown in the code. However, Chromes DevTools Network tab seems to suggest that the phoneAjaxCalls network requests are getting completed before the codephoneTlcForm.htmlcode document is loaded.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV23gZ.png altenter image description herep  pThe first 6 requests are all codephoneAjaxCallscode requests, and the last request is codephoneTlcForm.htmlcode from the code.getcode, but that should be firstp  pIt appears that the backend is receiving these requests in the same order as the Network tab is showing, because Im getting authorization errors in the responses to those codephoneAjaxCallscode requests.p  pWhat needs to happen is that the request to codephoneTlcForm.htmlcode should complete before any of the codephoneAjaxCallscode requests are made.p  h2Backgroundh2  pMy project is a plugin, so I cant modify the backend logic to make this process easier. The system that Im interfacing with has certain authorization requirements when creating or updating data. The backend system must see that the data fields that I want to modify were rendered in an HTML page embeforeem the requests that modify data are sent. This is why I need the codephoneTlcForm.htmlcode page to load before the other requests.p

Negative 1602 pI would like to start by saying that I am new to StackOverflow, so please forgive me if I make any newbie mistakes.p  pI have been assigned to write a java swing program that searches a URL specified by user, then pull the HTML code, and display all the image tags and link tags found in the HTML code. As of right now, I have a GUI that consists of one JTextField for the user to specify the URL, two JTextAreas to output link tags and image tags, and a search button. Once the user has searched a URL, the HTML code is read in and if the line contains an image tag or link tag it is written to the corresponding text file.

Negative 1602 pI am writing a transmuxer to turn MPEGTS files from an HLS stream into MP4 files, which can then be played in a web browser.p  pI had expected to be able to just do a simple onetoone mapping of TS files to MP4 files, but it turns out that some HLS streams are divided up such that the individual TS files do not always start on IDR frames this results in frozen images and stuttering whenever you cross a segment boundary.p  pI figure I can fix this by concatenating the data from multiple TS files, ignoring the original file boundaries, identifying the IDR frames in the video stream myself, and starting each new MP4 segment on an IDR frame. If I do this, however, Im worried about possible corruption at the emendsem of files IDR frames guarantee that no later frame can reference any earlier data, but nothing indicates that earlier B frames cant look forward past an IDR frame.p  pSo, how do I know where it is safe to make the cut, such that B frames before the cut wont try to look past itp

Negative 1602 pI am developing an app that uses ArcGIS iOS SDK.

As said above the SDK only exposed API amp usually accepts URL as a parameter. If i supply the URL of the map service, it would fetch the map info like images, etc amp loads it on my view. This token is used by my backend team to authorize the user amp respond the relevant map information from GIS server.p  pI wanted to know if this possible amp if yes how can I accomplish it. The web developers who use the ARCGIS SDK for .Net managed it by writing a proxy between the SDK amp service connector. They are suggesting me to also do a similar thing but I doubt if that is possible in iOS.p  pDid someone come across a similar scenario where u need to proxy the service calls made a library integrated in an iOS application.

Negative 1602 pI am trying to install the new version of Yosemite on my Mountain Lion 10.8. For this I need to back up my existing data of 95GB using Time Machine. I created a partition of my original 750GB drive into two, the new one being 110GB. I wish to back my whole data into this new partition and then upgrade to Yosemite. p  pSO when I created the new partition using disk utility, it created a new drive Macintosh Drive 2. But on the desktop now, I see the icon for new drive which is essentially empty. But the previous drive icon is not visible. How do I get to see both drive icons on desktop of one drive icon which gives access to me both the drives just like Windows OS. p  pAlso, is this an ok way of upgrading OS X. Will upgrading to Yosemite would affect any of my existing softwares and tools like Anaconda for python etc p

Negative 1602 pCurrently Im using socket.io without RethinkDB like thisp  pClients emit events to socket.io, which receives the events, emits to various other clients, and saves to the db for persistence. A new client connecting will get existing data from the db then listen to new events over socket.io.p  pHow would switching to RethinkDB and the changefeed help me herep  pThe way I see the same working with RethinkDB is the client could do a POST which inserts into RethinkDB instead of emitting to socket.io, and then socket.io is watching a RethinkDB changefeed and emitting to all clients when it receives new data.p  pHow is this method using RethinkDB and the changefeed better than my current method To me they both feel like they accomplish the same thing, but I dont see any obvious advantage in the RethinkDB method, and because Id be going to the db rather than emitting from socket.io on the server straight away it will surely be a bit slower.p

Negative 1602 pSo Im doing template matching on a colored image and skimage.feature.matchtemplate seems to work just fine. But Im not sure exactly how it is performing this because although the original images are size N x N x 3, the array output is one dimensional. I theorized that it was only performing the template match on the red layer perhaps, but this doesnt seem to be the case.  Does it do some sort of averaging for RGB images I want to understand where its getting its values from so I know that its interpreting the image correctly. Thanksp

Negative 1602 pI have been experimenting with ELK stack for a while now following a few resources on the web. But I didnt find any significant resource that clearly explains the difference between codefieldnamecode and codefieldname.rawcode for a field with say name codefieldnamecode. p  pThere is nothing much to try in this context but I did try and search this but no luck. The only primary understanding that I have on this is form Kibana window which I dont know how to reproduce, sadly that said codefieldnamecode is an analyzed field. There was not such info regarding codefieldname.rawcodep  pOne other thing I noticed is that when I use codefieldname.raw valuecode in the Kibana4 strongDiscoverstrong it shows little more results than what I see codefieldname valuecode. I could not see which ones were missing since I had 559 and 554 results form these inputs, respectively.p  pI am guessing the suffix code.rawcode says what it means  It might be a field from the logs itself without any intervention by Logstash. But I want to make sure if that is what it means. If so, then how and more importantly, why did I get less results in an analyzed field Is there anything that Logstash isnt doing right or is it some kind of misconfiguration Any pointers are appreciated.p

Negative 1602 pI would like to find out if it is nowadays possible to implement the download testing using Selenium. It would suffice to detect if the file download has started.  It is important to say that the files are not static, so they are not accessible over specific URL. They are dynamically created and filled with data, depending on the userprovided input.  I also cannot use the FirefoxProfile, because my automated webtests use chrome driver and phantomjs. They also need to run under Hudson here is of course used only phantomjs. Application runs under JBoss Server so I am using Arquillian libraries.p  pThank youp

Negative 1602 pI am writing a hybrid single page webPhoneGap application in Flask. Since cookies in a PhoneGap application are basically unavailable, I have implemented a custom a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgdocs0.10apisessioninterfacesession interfacea that completely avoids cookies. It stores session data in the application database and passes the session ID explicitly in the HTTP request and response bodies.p  pI have created a a hrefhttpsgithub.comjgonggrijpsessiontestcaseGitHub repositorya with a reduced testcase. Its still a sizeable project in its own right, but the Readme should help you to quickly find your way. The repo includes seven tests that all succeed when using Flasks default cookiebased session interface and all fail with my custom session interface. The main problem appears to be that data are sometimes not retained on the session object, but this is mysterious because the session object inherits from Pythons builtin codedictcode, which shouldnt spontaneously forget data. In addition, the session interface is straightforward and doesnt seem to make any obvious mistakes compared to a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgsnippets75Flasks example Redis session snippeta.p  pTo make matters more frustrating, the custom session interface seems to work correctly in the actual application. Only the unit tests are failing. However, for this reason it is unsafe to assume that the session interface works correctly in all circumstances.p  pHelp will be much appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrong Gist is not accepting the reduced testcase because it includes directories. I am now moving it to a fullblown GitHub repository. Ill update this post again when done.p  pstrongNew editstrong moved the reduced testcase to a proper GitHub repo. The Readme still mentions this Gist, sorry.p
Negative 1602 pTLDR How can I create the text for hoverover tooltips on google maps on the fly just as they are hoveredoverp  pMore detailp  pIm making google maps markers in what I think is the usual wayp  precodevar mar  new google.maps.Marker   positionloca.loc,   mapmap,   titleformatTitledata[i],   iconireturnColorsloca.lang10.png   codepre  pBut Im stuck because my map is in more than one language, so I want to display the tooltip in language A or language B based on a setting in the page.  Ive been able to configure all my other stuff for example, InfoWindows, etc by simply setting callbacks and at the moment when the display is called, I see which langauge were using and I show the appropriate text.p  pThe thing is that I want my hoverover tooltips titles to be in either langauge too.  Nevertheless, I havent figured out what callback if any is getting triggered when a tooltip gets displayed.  As Ive written the code above, the marker gets created when the map loads and the tooltip along with it.  I want some way to generate the tooltiptitle on the fly as the hoverover occurs.p  pThanks for any tipsp  pEDITp  pOne commenter downvoted the question without knowing the answer so that seems a little weird and made me think that perhaps Im not being specific enough.p  pSome event fires in the browser code to indicate that its time to display the tooltip at suchandsuch coordinates.  I want to override that event, if necessary.p  pClearly theres some code somewhere which dislays that text, I want to find that code and potentially override it.p  pHopefully that helps clarify what Im asking.  I dont need it to be a method in the google.maps. class hierarchy, I just need to be able to display the text dynamically.p  pPerhaps some other hoverovertooltip is the way to go, Ive done this some years ago with CSS pseudoclasses but surely theres some modern approach someone can recommend.p
