Positive 190 pExcuse my dev ops naivet but I assume all you need to deploy to a machine is a proper SSH key, a port to expose, the machines IP address a login and the code to deploy.  p  pSo are there any simple solutions that deploy code to a remote server with the only input being an SSH key, a Dockerfile and the code itself  Im thinking it could be set up in a deterministic almost functional manner where the input is server IP address, login, and the output is a running server.p  pIve tried setting up Dokku on digital ocean a hrefhttpswww.digitalocean.comcommunitytutorialshowtousethedigitaloceandokkuapplicationhttpswww.digitalocean.comcommunitytutorialshowtousethedigitaloceandokkuapplicationa and that requires a DNS record, and git.  I dont need those as dependencies.p  pThanksp
Positive 190 pIn developing a network application for Windows, I need to consider how the software will operate if the application is installed and run in a Domain environment, as compared to a Workgroup or nondomain environment.  I have limited experience with software in such installations, and although we will test our product thoroughly, I need to be aware of differences that may exist as early as possible.p  pThe application is currently targeted at code.NET4.5code and consists of two modulesp  ol liA Windows service, run as codeLocalSystemcode, which starts Automatically.li liA WinForms application, run on the system at login, which lives in the task tray for 99 of its life.li ol  pThe Windows Servicep  ol liUses two specific codeUDPcode and codeTCPcode ports to communicate over the local network.li liCommunicates with the WinForms application via codeTCPcode at codelocalhostcode.li liCommunicates with a server on the internet, outbound only, via a RESTful API.li liAutomatically attempts to create exceptions for itself in the Windows Firewall. Customers will be expected to create any other required exceptions for other firewall or AV products manually.li liDuring a livetest installation in the wild would ideally have attached codecdb.execode or similar for the purpose of automatically building a crash dump should the service throw an unhandled exception and terminate.li ol  pThe WinForms Applicationp  ol liDoes not have UserSpecific configurations.  Applicationlevel configurations only.li liCommunicates with the Windows Service via codeTCPcode at codelocalhostcode.li liFollowing installation should run at login for all users.li ol  pGiven this arrangement and description, what are some potential pitfalls that I should be aware of, if the operating environment is domainbasedp  pFor example, how can a Group Policy affect the desired operation per above  Its not a problem for us to require that such a Group Policy must be changedp

Positive 190 pI have an application configuration file, for example in Django there is a settings.py file. Within that file are database connection settings like sop  precodeDATABASES       default          ENGINE django.db.backends.mysql,         NAME dbname,         USER dbuser,         PASSWORD dbpass,         HOST localhost,         PORT 3306,     ,  codepre  pAnd then in environment specific groupvars files I have some variables that store values that will replace the ones in the settings.py file during a deploy role task.p  pWhat is the best practice for the above scenario Should dbname be something like [DBNAMEPLACEHOLDER] and then Ansible replaces that with a specified variable from the proper groupvars filep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI instead used an approach where I turned settings.py into a jinja2 template and now have a settings.py.j2 file in the templates directory of my deploy role. Then I made a task in my deploy role to use the template module to place the file in the right place.p  pI also removed settings.py from my django code base, as it is now being written during an ansible deploy play. I had to then edit my .gitignore to ignore changes to the settings.py file. This seems like a hacky workaround. Maybe place settings.py outside of the django source and then modify DJANGOSETTINGSMODULE environment variablep

Positive 190 pIm trying to understand what is the best way to deploy custom modules from a development environment to staging or production. Reading from SugarCRM support pages a hrefhttpsupport.sugarcrm.com04KnowledgeBase02Administration100StudioandModuleBuilder01BestPracticesWhenBuildingCustomModules relnofollowhttpsupport.sugarcrm.com04KnowledgeBase02Administration100StudioandModuleBuilder01BestPracticesWhenBuildingCustomModulesa, all new modules should be built with Module Builder. The output of this is a code.zipcode file which is a deployable unit. Then the support page says never to redeploy a package and all further modifications should be done with Studio.p  blockquote   pOnce the module is deployed, you should use Studio to perform any additional configurations to your module ...p blockquote  pAs I understand, Studio modifies files in the codecustomcode directory and theres no deployable package with the changes e.g. a code.zipcode file. How can I deploy changes made with Studio to staging or production environments I was thinking of using Git and have the modifications in codecustomcode directory tracked. Then I could pull the changes to the desired environment. Is this a viable solution Or has anyone come up with something elsep

The applets are from an external vendor and have not been updated, thus the need for this function in the DRS. Both the applets launch Java and then switch to JRE 1.7.079, as directed. One loads fine, the other errors with ClassNotFoundException  comAppNamewcmapiUser.

Positive 190 pMy data is in a SQL database and models are scaffolded, all works well on my machine. I deploy the web application to another machine, on that machine I also instantiate my SQL database. The web application launches fine until I try to login. On my local machine in my Web.config I see that the DefaultConnection is local and I believe this is where user identities, authentication etc. takes place. My DB entities are correctly accessed with another connection string. Ideally Id like to move the ASP.NET user database to be alongside my model tables. I create the deployment as a file deployment as the target machine has no internet access.p

I have the ftp credentials for the old site but I have no clue how I can sort of clone the new Laravel site to the old one.p  pBriefly, I have a Laravel app running on insertname.eu1.frbit.net but I want it to be hosted on www.insertname.com which an older site is being hosted on for the time being.p  pCan anyone help me out There must be a way to do this.

Negative 190 pSo, I have an autocomplete dropdown with a list of townships. Initially I just had the 20 or so that we had in the database... but recently, we have noticed that some of our data lies in other counties... even other states. So, the answer to that was buy one of those databases with all towns in the US yes, I know, geocoding is the answer but due to time constraints we are doing this until we have time for that feature. p  pSo, when we had 2025 towns the autocomplete worked stellarly... now that there are 80,000 its not as easy. p  pAs I type I am thinking that the best way to do this is default to this state, then there will be much less. I will add a state selector to the page that defaults to NJ then you can pick another state if need be, this will narrow down the list to lt 1000. Though, I may have the same issue Does anyone know of a work around for an autocomplete with a lot of data p  pshould I post teh codez of my webservicep

Negative 190 pWhen you write an iterator function in C, using yield syntax, the compiler internally translates your function into a class. So, if I write something like thisp  precodeIEnumeratorltintgt MyIterator     for int i  0 i lt 10 i     yield return i  codepre  pInvoking MyIterator constructs a class with a private field for i, instead of using a stack variable.p  pNow for the question I want to find a way to locate the field used to store is value. The reason is a little involvedp  pIm using iterator functions for cooperative threading. I write simple code like this in an iterator, in order to suspend execution of a function until an asynchronous operation has completed.p  precodeFutureltstringgt f yield return file.readLineout f string line  f.Result codepre  pWhen those three statements are executed, the readLine function is invoked and stores a future into the f field. The iterator function is then suspended, and wakes back up when the f Future has had a result stored into it, at which point I can retrieve the result.p  pWhat I want to be able to do, is thisp  precodestring line yield return file.readLineout line codepre  pUnder normal circumstances, this wouldnt be possible in .NET, since there is no way to guarantee that a stack variable stays alive long enough for me to be able to write to it.p  pHowever, knowing that iterator functions store all their locals inside of fields, I can theoretically do this by holding a reference to the iterator keeping it alive and to the field itself, so that when the readLine operation completes, I can store the result directly into the field.p  pThe problem is that the CLR doesnt seem to give me a way to do this.p  pIf I have an out or ref parameter, I can use unsafe C or raw MSIL to convert that parameter into a raw pointer, a reference, or a TypedReference. Unfortunately, its not legal to store any of those three types in a field  even if you trick the compiler into letting you do it, the bytecode verifier wont let you execute the code. This is most likely because storing a reference to a stack variable would be inherently unsafe.p  pSo what Im looking to do is write a function that takes an outref parameter, and searches the calling iterators fields to find a corresponding field. Once it has the field, it stores a reference to the iterator and field into a wrapper type and associates the wrapper with an asynchronous operation.p  pGiven the overhead involved in runtime reflection in .NET, I suspect that this isnt possible without either preprocessing my source code or postprocessing my assemblies after compilation.p  pHowever, Id love to hear some suggestions for alternate solutions.  Any ideasp

Negative 190 pI found a question already with a possible solution, but I had already tried the method suggested before reading it, and it even says its inconsistent.

But in the above scenario, Im just trying to tap into the new window to get what its alreadyset src. I have codeimgwin.htmlcode already written with a default codesrccode for the image, so it should alert that url. Instead I just get codeundefinedcode.p  pI also tried the following which should be identical on the back end, but with the same resultsp  precodeimg.clickfunction      var imgwindow  window.openimgwin.html,,width460,height345     alertimg,imgwindow.attrsrc  codepre  pI even tried variations of wrapping the codeimgwindowcode variable in codecode in case somehow jquery wasnt picking up on the variable as a DOM element.p  pThe only thing I can guess is that since codewindow.opencode is a method, jquery doesnt treat it like a DOM element, even though all documentation from basic javascript tutorials treat the variable as both a method to open the window and the pointer to the windows inner DOM.p  h2Noteh2  pI usually prefer and recommend to other developers the use of the jqueryui dialog widget, but in this scenario, the images are actually webcam feeds that the user will want to pop out of the main window and have open even if the main window is closed, so while I appreciate the move from popup windows in general, please avoid suggesting alternatives that involve samewindow widgets.

One disadvantage is that it only allows access to the cells from the inside, not in an action that validates the grid on command.pli lipA custom emitemRendererem is another possibility, as in the answer below, but like 3 above, it only allows access to the cells from the inside, not in an action that validates the grid on command.pli lipSee Richard Havens answer below.pli lipAnd heres a hrefhttpwww.switchonthecode.comtutorialsaccessingdatagriditemrenderers relnofollowhow to access the GUI objectsa The list of relevant GUI objects is a protected field so you can access it by subclassing, then iterate over the GUIcomponents which represent the cells and set the emerrorStringem on each one. pli ol

Your assumption is correct. I am modeling this application on the CoreData Books sample.  I am not using a button, but rather using two images to create a checked and unchecked checkbox.

Negative 190 pIm currently using the Silverlight Unit Test Framework, but Id prefer to run tests directly in VS2010.  Im curious to know what approaches and tools everyone else uses.p  pIm using Silverlight 4 with Prism and the MVVM pattern, and Im specifically interested in integrated Silverlight unit test support in VS 2010 that I can use with my ViewModel unit tests.  Im using dependency injection with Unity, and I am writing unit tests by mocking the calls in my WCF layer using Moq for Silverlight.  I am not even looking at integration tests at the moment, but even in a simple unit test which tests a single ViewModel command, the service request to my mocked service layer can take around 50 milliseconds.  Therefore support for asynchronous tests is important to me.p  pThe issue Im raising here is not related to View testing, which I have handled with some success in the past using System.Windows.Automation.Peers, and  although I have not used it yet  could possibly now handle more easily with the support in VS 2010 Feature Pack 2 which appears to be targeted at automation  playback of UI tests from what I gather.p  pI should mention that my findings from the products Ive looked at and used so far are as followsp  ul liSilverlight Unit Test Framework  I currently use this, and its great as far as it goes, but its limitations are a it is not integrated with Visual Studio and b if you dont want to run all tests, you are limited to the crude tag expression filter.li liStatLight  very nice.  I currently use this, and have used it since v0.9 when targeting Silverlight 3 on a previous project.  Being a commandline tool, it can be integrated with a continuous integration server  which certainly handles another required scenario.  But it is of no use directly in terms of Visual Studio integration during the development process.li liUnit Test Result Viewer for Silverlight Visual Studio extension on the Visual Studio gallery  looks promising, but its limitations are a currently fails to find projects which are located in solution folders, rather than under the solution root and b runs emallem tests in a given assembly via StatLight, with no apparent ability to run a specific test, or a selection of tests.li liEinar Ingebrigtsens Silverlight Unit Test Runner for ReSharper, which later became Odin  ahead of the game it first appeared in 2008, but the limitation is that it appears that this project is no longer maintained most recent update is Apr 2009.li liAgUnit ReSharper plugin  a hrefhttpagunit.codeplex.comhttpagunit.codeplex.coma   looks excellent initially. After downloading the source code for it and building the latest bugfixed version to work against ReSharper 5.1, I was very encouraged.  But unfortunately it does not handle asynchronous tests.  This is a design limitation with the threading, so it does not matter whether you try to use the asynchronous support that is built into Silverlight Unit Test Framework Microsoft.Silverliht.Testing.SilverlightTest base class, or whether youre using AutoResetEvent or anything else.  This has been noted by the coordinator on the projects discussion forum on CodePlex.  This is a massive limitation.li liTestDriven.NET 3.0  appears to have support for Silverlight 4.0 tests at first glance, but the limitation I suspect is Silverlight 4 assembly portability i.e. the 5 dependent assemblies that are portable between SL4 and .NET 4.  Certainly, when I tried using it with a simple POC, it crashed my instance of VS 2010.li ul  pPerhaps Ive missed something here  I wonder if anyone in the community has any better ideas for Silverlight unit testingp

Negative 190 pIve already looked for the answer for this question, and Ive found the following suggestionsp  ol liIf you are always expecting to find a value then throw the exception if it is missing. The exception would mean that there was a problem. If the value can be missing or present and both are valid for the application logic then return a null.li liOnly throw an exception if it is truly an error. If it is expected behavior for the object to not exist, return the null.li ol  pBut how should I interpret them in my so casual case My web app controller is receiving request to show details for a user with a certain id. Controller asks the service layer to get the user, and then the service returns the object, if its found. If not, a redirect to default location is issued.p  pWhat should I do when someone passes invalid user id inside the request URL Should I consider it as expected behaviour and return null to the controller, or perhaps should I call it a problem or unexpected behaviour and thus throw an exception inside the service method and catch in inside the controllerp  pTechnically its not a big difference after all, but Id like to do it the right way by following standard convetions. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.p  pEDIT I assume, that the URLs generated by the app are valid and existing  when clicked by user, the user with a certaing id should be found. I want to know how to handle a situation, when user tries to access URL with wrong not existing user id, by manually typing the URL into browsers address bar.p

Negative 190 pFor one of our applications, Ive written a utility that uses javas DOM parser. It basically takes an XML file, parses it and then processes the data using one of the following methods to actually retrieve the data. p  precodegetElementByTagName getElementAtIndex getFirstChild getNextSibling getTextContent codepre  pNow i have to do the same thing but i am wondering whether it would be better to use an XSLT stylesheet. The organisation that sends us the XML file keeps changing their schema meaning that we have to change our code to cater for these shema changes. Im not very familiar with XSLT process so im trying to find out whether im better of using XSLT stylesheets rather than manual parsing. p  pThe reason XSLT stylesheets looks attractive is that i think that if the schema for the XML file changes i will only need to change the stylesheet Is this correct p  pThe other thing i would like to know is which of the two XSLT transformer or DOM parser is better performance wise. For the manual option, i just use the DOM parser to parse the xml file. How does the XSLT transformer actually parse the file Does it include additional overhead compared to manually parsing the xml file The reason i ask is that performance is important because of the nature of the data i will be processing. p  pAny advicep  pThanksp  h2Edith2  pBasically what I am currently doing is parsing an xml file and process the values in some of the xml elements. I dont transform the xml file into any other format. I just extract some value, extract a row from an Oracle database and save a new row into a different table. The xml file I parse just contains reference values I use to retrieve some data from the database.p  pIs xslt not suitable in this scenario Is there a better approach that I can use to avoid code  changes if the schema changesp  h2Edit 2h2  pApologies for not being clear enough about what i am doing with the XML data. Basically there is an XML file which contains some information. I extract this information from the XML file and use it to retrieve more information from a local database. The data in the xml file is more like reference keys for the data i need in the database. I then take the content i extracted from the XML file plus the content i retrieved from the database using a specific key from the XML file and save that data into another database table. p  pThe problem i have is that i know how to write a DOM parser to extract the information i need from the XML file but i was wondering whether using an XSLT stylesheet was a better option as i wouldnt have to change the code if the schema changes. p  pReading the responses below it sounds like XSLT is only used for transorming and XML file to another XML file or some other format. Given that i dont intend to transform the XML file, there is probably no need to add the additional overhead of parsing the XSLT stylesheet as well as the XML file. p

Negative 190 pI have a main view that is supposed to display several subviews.

Negative 190 pI have a codeTestcode modeltable and a codeTestAuditLogcode modeltable, using SQLAlchemy and SQL Server 2008.  The relationship between the two is codeTest.id  TestAuditLog.entityIdcode, with one test having many audit logs.  codeTestAuditLogcode is intended to keep a history of changes to rows in the codeTestcode table.

Negative 190 pI have a website that is hosted in a different timezone than the users using the application. In addition to this, users can have a specific timezone. I was wondering how other SO users and applications approach this The most obvious part is that inside the DB, datetimes are stored in UTC. When on the server, all datetimes should be dealt with in UTC. However, I see three problems that Im trying to overcomep  ol lipGetting the current time in UTC solved easily with codeDateTime.UtcNowcode.pli lipPulling datetimes from the database and displaying these to the user. There are potentially emlotsem of calls to print dates on different views. I was thinking of some layer in between the view and the controllers that could solve this issue. Or having a custom extension method on codeDateTimecode see below. The major down side is that at emeveryem location of using a datetime in a view, the extension method must be called p  pThis would also add difficulty to using something like the codeJsonResultcode. You could no longer easily call codeJsonmyEnumerablecode, it would have to be codeJsonmyEnumerable.SelecttransformAllDatescode. Maybe AutoMapper could help in this situationpli lipGetting input from the user Local to UTC. For example, POSTing a form with a date would require converting the date to UTC before. The first thing that comes to mind is creating a custom codeModelBindercode.pli ol  pHeres the extensions that I thought of using in the viewsp  precodepublic static class DateTimeExtensions      public static DateTime UtcToLocalthis DateTime source,          TimeZoneInfo localTimeZone              return TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtcsource, localTimeZone           public static DateTime LocalToUtcthis DateTime source,          TimeZoneInfo localTimeZone              source  DateTime.SpecifyKindsource, DateTimeKind.Unspecified         return TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeToUtcsource, localTimeZone       codepre  pI would think that dealing with timezones would be such a common thing considering a lot of applications are now cloudbased where the servers local time could be much different than the expected time zone. p  pHas this been elegantly solved before Is there anything that Im missing Ideas and thoughts are much appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong To clear some confusion I thought add some more details. The issue right now isnt emhowem to store UTC times in the db, its more about the process of going from UTCLocal and LocalUTC. As Max Zerbini points out, its obviously smart to put the UTCLocal code in the view, but is using the codeDateTimeExtensionscode really the answer When getting input from the user, does it make sense to accept dates as the users local time since thats what JS would be using and then use a codeModelBindercode to transform to UTC The users timezone is stored in the DB and is easily retrieved.p

Should I pass the reference of the managedObjectContext into each different view within the parentView so that all the views can pull from and write to Core Data themselves Or should I keep the reference in the parentView, and let the children pass the requests to the parent to handlep  pThanks p

Negative 190 pI am debugging our webapp.   It is configured to create a DataSourceTransactionManager bean and also a HibernateTransactionManager bean on startup.   This is not intentional but is caused by a 3rd party dependency.  The effect appears to be benign.

Negative 190 pMy company is looking at SVN for our new version control tool but are worried that it stores passwords in plain text for our Unix users.p  pI saw that SVN now offers an alternative for GNOME and KDE users where the password is stored in a keyring, but many of our Unix users dont use either desktop environment.p  pIm looking for any alternative out there that can encrypt the passwords.  I did find a a hrefhttpwww.stylesen.orgfilessenthilbitsdissertation.pdf relnofollowdissertation from 2010a that described using the GNU Privacy Guards GPGAgent to act as a keyring for nix OSs that didnt already have a keyring.  The solution looks great, but I cant find any examples for how to install it.  Does anyone know what happened to this project  The author was working in conjunction with Collab.Net and seemed to have a working demo put together.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pIm referring to the SVN client.  It caches passwords for users convenience so they dont need to retype their credentials for every operation.  In Windows it encrypts that stored password.  In Mac, GNOME and KDE it uses a keyring to encrypt and store them.  In all other nix Desktop environments it stores them as plain text.  As we dont use GNOME or KDE this makes management very uncomfortable. See a hrefhttpwww.linuxforu.com200905subversion16securityimprovementsillustrated relnofollowSVN Client Password Cachingap

The .click wont work since it a its not consistent across browsers, but b more so because its not actually the same as the user clicking the link. Also, using the CBOpen script to rebuild a duplicate gallery didnt seem like a very ideal option nor could I get it to work and the .click just doesnt work with clearbox likely since its not actually the same as a user click.p  pSo, I could change the ImageButton input control to be an anchor instead and set the href to the first in the gallery Im displaying and then set the other list of anchors to start with image 2 in the list. However, when the user clicks the textual link View Photos 3 it will bring up clearbox on the index of the 2nd photo and not the first. So that works, but isnt an ideal solution either since I need it to come up and show the 1st photo from both places which wouldnt make sense for clearbox since the href of the anchor points to image 2 and not 1.p  pBasically, I am wondering if there is a way to bring up my already definedcreated clearbox gallery associted with the list of defined anchors on page from another control possibly even another anchor, but without images from gallery to avoid duplication andor issue outlined abovep  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 190 pIs there a way for me to return emfromem my caller instead of emtoem my caller e.g.p  precodesub foo      bar      this never gets executed   sub bar      returnfromcaller5    This prints 5 print foo codepre  pRationale I am writing a function memoizeself that memoizes a function from within the function itself. Id like it to work like thisp  precodesub complexfunction      my x, y       memoizeselfkey gt y, expiresin gt 5min      compute result     return result  codepre  pmemoizeself will check its cache, and if it gets a hit, return the cached value emfromem its caller. Otherwise, it will recall the function with a dynamically scoped var to avoid the obvious infinite loop, store the return value in the cache and again return it.p  pWithout the ability to return from caller, Id probably use  and write it this wayp  precodereturn  if memoizeselfkey gt y, expiresin gt 5min codepre  pBut this is extra noise, and also doesnt take context into account.p  pEDIT To the people who reasonably suggested a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocMemoize relnofollow titleMemoizeMemoizea  yes, I should have said, I know this module well. Im writing a more modern and featureful version of Memoize based on a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocCHI relnofollow titleCHICHIa.p  pBut as relates to this question, there are cases where its useful to memoize from emwithinem the function rather than emoutsideem the function Memoize only does the latter. It makes it easy to customize the cache key andor determine whether you want to memoize at all for this particular call. e.g.p  precodesub complexfunction      my key  ...    normalize arguments     if ...         is it worth memoizing in this case         memoizeselfkey gt key       codepre  pI also like the way it is wrapped up in the function instead of creating its own line outside, ala a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgfunctionsstate.html relnofollow titlestate variablesstate variablesa.p

Negative 190 pI hope someone can help me solve a very serious problem we face at the moment with a business critical application losing data when a user works in it. p  pThis happens randomly  I have never reproduced this but the users are in the system a lot more than me. p  pA document is created with a load of fields on it, and there are 2 rich text fields. Were using Domino 8.5.3  there are no extension lib controls in use. The document has workflow built in, and all validation is done by a SSJS function called from the data query save event.  There is an insane amount of logging to the sessionscope.log and also this is now captured for each user in a notes document so I can review what they are doing. p  pSometimes, a user gets to a workflow step where they have to fill in a Rich Text field and make a choice in a dropdown field, then they submit the document with a workflow button. When  the workflow button is pressed does a Full Update some client side JS runs first p  precode Process any autogenerated submit listeners if XSP.processListeners   Not sure if this is valid in all versions of XPages     XSP.processListeners XSP.querySubmitListeners, document.forms[0].id   codepre  pI added this to try and prevent the RTF fields losing their values after reading a blog but so far its not workingp  pthen the Serverside event runs and calls view.save to trigger QS code for validation and PS code to run the workflow agent on the server. p  p95 of the time, this works fine.p  p5 of the time however, the page refreshes all the changes made, both to the RFT field CKEditor and the dropdown field are reloaded as they were previously, with no content. Its like the save hasnt happened, and the Full Update button has decided to work like a page refresh instead of a submit. p  pUnder normal circumstances, the log shows that when a workflow button is pressed, the QuerySave code starts and returns True. Then the ID of the workflow button pressed is logged so I can see which ones are being used when I am reviewing problems, then the PostSave code starts and finally returns true. p  pWhen there is a problem, The QuerySave event runs, returns true if the validation has passed, or false if its failed, and then it stops. The ID of the workflow button is also logged. But the code should continue by calling the PostSave function if the QuerySave returns true  it doesnt even log that its starting the PostSave function.p  pAnd to make matters worse, after the failure to call the PostSave code, the next thing that is logged is the beforePageLoad event running and this apparently reloads the page, which hasnt got the recent edits on it, and so the users loses all the information they have typed p  pThis has to be the most annoying problem Ive ever encountered with XPages as I can find no reason why a successful QuerySave or even a failure because mandatory fields werent filled in would cause the page to refresh like this and lose the content. Please please can someone help point me in the right direction p

Negative 190 pIm trying to finish the search function in one of the sites Im developing. Since my search results only display excerpts of the contents of matched items, what I want to do is to highlight search terms within the search results and display only portions of texts that actually contain those search terms.p  pWhat I figured Id do is to fetch the whole content from the database and use codepregreplacecode to insert codeltspangtcode elements around the search terms and at the same time extract only the first 10 words before and after the term. So this is the regex part of itp  precode.wW0,10.implode, terms.WwW0,10 codepre  pBasically, I try to discard all text except the first 10 words before the search term by using a noncapturing subpattern, then get the 10 words before the term, then the term itself, then the next 10 words.p  pThis is the replacement text in codepregreplacecodep  precode1ltspan classsearchterm searchtermcontentgt2ltspangt3... codepre  pThe search term is being searched via the codeMySQLcodes codeMATCH...AGAINSTcode for codeMyISAM FULLTEXTcode indeces on multiple columns. However, the above regex is only being applied in one column lets call this column, the one that uses the above regex, codecontentcode.p  pSo my problem is whenever I get a match on other columns but not on the codecontentcode column, the regex above strips all text from the codecontentcode column. Thats because of the code.code subpattern at the very beginning which continues to match without ever finding the next subpatterns.p  pI was wondering if there was any other way to implement the original purpose of the regex without this side effect. I am currently thinking of simply using codepregmatchallcode to just match the search term and 10 words before and after it. Ill just iterate over all of the matches and build the preview text manually. Yes, this is a sound solution but given my inexperience with regex, I thought I might as well try to find a solution to this.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI just noticed that I only get blank codecontentscode when I put 2 or more search terms. Other than that, it works perfectly. I now have no idea why this is happening.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pEchoing codepreglasterrorcode, I get this error codePREGBACKTRACKLIMITERRORcode. I use the words codenewcode and codepostcode for the search terms.p  pA codevardumpcode of the regex and the terms show thisp  precode.wW0,10newpostWwW0,10i  array   0 gt string new length3   1 gt string post length4 codepre  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pI used codeRegex Coachcode to walk me through the matching pattern, it seems that it backtracks too much after it finds no match for codenewpostcode. The target text is simply a random 3paragraph lorem ipsum. I think I need to find a better regex for this task.p  pstrongUPDATE 4strongp  pUsing a codeOnceOnlycode subpattern solves the problem. Though I have no idea of its details, I just reread the PHP Manual and read a part of it that codeOnceOnlycode subpatterns help with too much backtracking. This is the new regexp  precode.gtwW0,10.implode, terms.WwW0,10 codepre  pBut Im still open for suggestions for better regexes. Thanksp

Negative 190 pMy problem is that I am using nested scrollviews. One for the horizontal paging and second to show the content with vertical scrolling cuz content, which is text, is more than the available space. Actually there are multiple copies of this vertical scrollview likep  precodeMainScrollView Horizontal      VerticalScrollView1      VerticalScrollView2      VerticalScrollView3 codepre  pBesides these the vertical scrollviews contains label that are draggable, I implemented dragging using touchesBegan and moved events. I developed the whole thing using only one vertical scrollview and its working just fine and I thought, to my dismay, that itll work exactly the same for the rest but when I added more vertical scrollviews, only the last one is allowing dragging of the labels. The first two aint allowing dragging, besides, they are also not responding to the vertical scrolling event, which was perfect earlier. I tried it with two vertical scrollviews and even then only the last one was allowing dragging. Aint sure about the vertical scrolling cuz right now only the first one has enough content to be scrolled rest need not to. I can try that out too but its kinda late here, so, if someone can guide me with the provided info. would be much helpful.

Negative 190 pSpending time reading through the docs, and searching for examples. I understand cropping an image from top 0, and left 0 is pretty straight forward. However. I would like to pass 2 sets of coordinates, a starting point and an ending point. Four Points, a Square that is defined anywhere. However from the examples I am finding, and from what I gather the rendition is not going to let me do this. codeigniter so I am seeking confirmation on this thought, is it true that I can only provide end points from 0, and it crops a square based on said end points or can I actually specify an x start, an x end, and similar for yp  pOr is there some other technique I can use within codeigniter that will allow me to pass for coordinates for starting and ending pointsp

Negative 190 pI am writing an application using WPF and the MVVM design pattern Im new to the MVVM pattern too. This application manages and keeps track of films the user has watched. It also needs to contact external websites in order to download metadata for films.

Negative 190 pCurrently Im using jquery.maskedinput for verious mask formats, but its not working for phone numbers.p  pIn Brasil we used to have all numbers in the format 9999999999. But lately, in a few cities, cell phones are using 99999999999, while their normal phones and the rest of the country remain 9999999999.p  pjquery.maskedinput seems to not support 2 formats on the same input where a character in the middle of the string may or may not be present. As I can see in its documentation, I could have 9999999999 and 99999999999, but that would confuse users.p  pIs there any other mask pluginframework that allows me to validate both 9999999999 and 99999999999p  pEdit I created a full test using harry and Dmitrii solutions a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netNSd6g relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netNSd6ga codefull.inputmask999999[9]9999codep  pIm gonna wait a bit more to see if I can find an even better solution.

Negative 190 pI really cant make this up so Id be thankful for any hint. I must make some mistake here 4.1.2.p  pI have an codeActivitycode which, in codeonCreatecode, sets up a subclassed codeArrayAdaptercode for codeListViewcode items which render as a codeCheckablecode codeViewGroupcode.p  pThe codeActivitycode already utilizes a codeNonConfigurationcode mechanism to rebuild the Adapter upon orientation change. However, its currently not storing the codeListViewcodes codegetCheckedItemPositioncode because I feel it shouldnt be necessary details below.p  pInterestingly, what Im observing is the following.p  ul liThe Activity is rendered.li liThe user checks a ListView item.li liThe ListView item is displayed in a checked state.li liThe codeonItemClickListenercode calls codegetCheckedItemPositioncode for the codeListViewcode and gets a correct result.li liThe user changes the screen orientation.li licodeonCreatecode rebuilds the ListView and it displays just like before after codeonCreatecode see below.li licodeonCreatecode calls codegetCheckedItemPositioncode and gets code1code despite the codeListViewcode showing the correcly checked itemli ul  pUpon further examination, the following details emerge.p  ul licodeonCreatecode ul liget codeListViewcode resourceli libuild codeMyAdaptercodeli liset codeMyAdaptercode as adapter for codeListViewcodeli licodegetCheckedItemPositioncode returns code1codeli ulli liafter codeonCreatecode ul licodeMyAdapter.getViewcode is being calledli licodeCheckableViewGroup.setCheckedcode is called with the correct codecheckedcode valueli lithe last two steps will be repeated for all itemsli ulli ul  pAs said before, Im relying on the Android feature that codeViewcode objects save their state if they have an ID assigned. Id say this is the case since there must be some object out there which sets the correct codecheckedcode status for all the list entries. By the way, codeCheckableViewGroupcode also overrides codeonSave,RestoreInstanceStatecode but that wont be called regardless whether or not it has an ID assigned presumably because it never gets attached to the layout root.p  pSo it stronglooks as if the codeListViewcode at the same time knows and does not know its codegetCheckedItemPositioncodestrong Or am I on the wrong trackp  precodepublic final class MyActivity extends Activity      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.myactivity         itemList  ListViewfindViewByIdR.id.malist         listAdapter  new MyAdapter         itemList.setAdapterlistAdapter         itemList.setOnItemClickListener             new OnItemClickListener                  Override                 public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt av, View v, int pos, long id  checkForm                                listAdapterSetup          this is where itemList.getCheckedItemPosition returns 1          when the listView has been rebuilt from NonConfiguration data         checkForm        codepre

Negative 190 pIn this situation, there are multiple rows with the same device GUID because more than one user may use the same app on the device but not simultaneouslyunless theyre extraordinarily close. What this query does is get all the rows that share the same device GUID, then sets the InUse bit to true 1 if the UserId matches 3012. Any row within that set with a different user ID gets its InUse bit set to false 0.

When theres an error in the connection config I didnt find a working method to evaluate that a connection could not be estabilished to the other database.p  pI found out that I could check if dbconnid is false to eventually return an error to the user but for some reasons it returns an object no matter what.p  pThis is a brief example of what Im doing inside the modelp  precodefunction pluginsubscribersimportsfguardchannelid       Get the channel object by its ID     channel  thisgtgetchannelbyid,channelid       Set the preferences for the second database      from the channel informations we retrieved     db[hostname]  channelgthost     db[username]  channelgtuser     db[password]  channelgtpassword     db[database]  channelgtdb     db[dbdriver]  mysql     db[pconnect]  FALSE     db[dbdebug]  TRUE       Open the connection to the 2nd database     otherdb  thisgtloadgtdatabasedb,TRUE      if   otherdbgtconnid                This never gets executed as otherdbgtconnid always          returns resource34 of type mysql link         return false          else               Execute the rest of the import script         otherdbgtselect         otherdbgtfromsfguarduser         otherdbgtjoinsfguarduserprofile,                         sfguarduserprofile.idsfguarduser.id,                         inner         query  otherdbgtget       codepre  pI wonder if theres something I didnt get out of the whole thing or if Im using the wrong logic to evaluate if the secondary database has a proper connection open.p  pI also tried to trycatch the connection issue with no success.p  pThanks in advance for all the support you can offer.

Negative 190 pI have been using pyqt and qt designer to make a program.  I wanted to custom style the top bar which holds the icon and minimize,resize,close buttons.  To do this I started with using the Qt.FramelessWindowHint and making custom buttons and such.  This has led to many problems with grabbing corners to resize and also snapping all the built in windows functions.  I was trying to sort through this but found many people talking about the problems that I am having. I was trying to go for the google chromemayaphotoshop look where the top part is completely customized.  A friend pointed out that if any of these programs crash, you can notice the windows bar will show through, which means they are not actually removing it but styling above it or something of that sort.  How can I go about doing this so all the functionality is still there but it is styled.   p

Negative 190 pIve had a little trouble googling, so I thought Id just ask. Im writing a flashcard app on Android, using SQLite to store all the data about the decks and cards. I want the user to be able to give a deck a name, description, and image as an icon they can click when browsing the decks. Id also like each deck to be its own table. I dunno if this is perfect design or not Im not much of an SQL guy yet unfortunately.p  pSo at the moment, I need to create an entirely separate table called DeckDescriptions where each row is a deck, and the columns are name, description, and icon theres a key ID col, too, obviously. To get a decks description, I have to look there. To see what cards the deck holds, I have to use that information to find the correct REAL deck table, and get the cards from there. So is there a way to instead have the DeckDescriptions stuff be a part of each individual deck table Sort of like how static variables relate to C classes, Im thinking.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf I ever need to get all the cards in a specific deck, I have to access 3 tables DeckDescriptions, the table for the deck Im looking for, and a separate Card table which holds all cards the user has ever added. The separate card table is essential, because I want a user to be able to create a new deck from cards that have already been added before, and be alerted when they start creating a card theyve already made. So I cant just associate each card to an entry in the DeckDescriptions table with a foreign key. What if one card is in every single deckp

Here is some examplesp  pstrongProperly working button that is created when the page is refreshedstrongp  precodeltdiv idusercompletedlt i gtgt           lt if isrunneruser ampamp job.status  assigned gt             ltdiv classrow jobbuttons idusercompletedbuttonrowlt i gtgt               ltdiv classsmall6 columnsgt                 ltdiv classbutton small success radius usercompletedbutton datajobidlt i gtgtjob completedltdivgt               ltdivgt             ltdivgt           lt end gt         ltdivgt codepre  pstrongButton that is added with javascriptstrongp  precode        var usercompleted  ltdiv classrow jobbuttons idusercompletedbuttonrow  id  gt                                  ltdiv classsmall6 columnsgt                                      ltdiv classbutton small success radius usercompletedbutton datajobid  id  gtjob completedltdivgt                                  ltdivgt                                ltdivgt         var usercompleteddiv  usercompleted  id         usercompleteddiv.htmlusercompleted codepre  pThese are the two buttons that are supposed to be equivalent. The first button is created when a job is in the completed state upon refreshing the page, and the second button is created when the job is in the completed state and the page is not refreshed. These two buttons should have the exact same HTML.p  pNow when the first button is clicked, the javascript event goes off without a hitch, but when the second button is clicked, the javascript event will not fire at all. I keep checking the chrome developer tool and they seem to have exactly the same HTML.p  pHere is the event I am trying to trigger.p  precode  .usercompletedbutton.clickfunctione      var id  this.datajobid     var url  jobs  id     .ajax       type PUT,       url url,       data job status completed,       async false,          codepre  pSide note I am using the javascript plugin pusher as well as turbolinks.

Negative 190 pI have seen many examples of chat room systems over websocket implemented with erlang and cowboy. p  pMost of the examples I have seen use gproc. In practice each websocket handler registers itself with gproc and then broadcastsreceives messages from it.p  pSince a user could close by accident the webpage I am thinking about connecting to the websocket handler a genfsm which actually broadcastsreceives all the messages from gproc. In this way the genfsm could switch from a connected state to a disconnected state whenever the user exits and still buffer all the messages. After a while if the user is not back online the genfsm will terminate.p  pIs this a good solution How can I make the new websocket handler to recover the genfsm process Should I register the genfsm using the user name or is there any better solutionp

If I dont know reliably, its impossible for me to do.p  pIs there a reliable way in which I can calculate exactly what the float value should be for the pdf version to be exactly x pixels high It seems that the formula Im using doesnt work, or maybe theres something elsep

In contrast, codedefinecode creates a runtime constant which is not set until runtime.

So what is the compiler putting for the value of codeRADIUSTOCIRCUMFERENCEcodep  pIm guessing that the compiler creates some kind of placeholder for the value of codeRADIUSTOCIRCUMFERENCEcode, and at runtime, that placeholder gets replaced with the value of codeRADTOCIRCUMcode.

Negative 190 pHere is the situation. I have an admin panelwhich multiple admins use at the same time and employee panelwhich multiple employees use at the same time. An admin can chat with multiple employees at the same time but an employee can only chat with admin. All the chats are saved in databasemysql with their respective from,to,msg,time fields, using which both the sides match the messages according to their active chat sessions. Right now I am using a  codesetIntervalfunction .ajax... ,3000code and in return server returns emallem the messages to the admin yet only returns the specific messages of the requesting employee. But this is not a practical solution since it will, if its not right, overuse my server resources with too much database queries too. A lot of improvements are possible. Starting with passing the last messages time to the server which then only sends back the messages that arrived later than that time. Still the ajax is calling every 3 seconds and database queries stay the same too. Then I can make it a self calling function with a 30 seconds delay like the following example.p  precodewaitformsg     .ajax url server, success functiondata          Do whatever I wish with the data...     , dataType json, complete waitformsg, timeout 30000   codepre  pBut even if I use this technique, how to wait on the serverside, rather what to wait for Keeping in mind I also want to reduce the number of database queries yet the only thing I need is the bunch of messages received after the sent time value.

Negative 190 pWhen I try to merge code from trunk to a branch, it will not pick up all of my files.  The files will show skipped in the merge log.p  pOf course I searched for the issue first and found the common problem of merging but not committing, then reverting, then merging.  Some order of those functions seems to cause a problem.  Something with the file still being on my hard drive but not in SVN so it is skipped.  I dont think that is whats going on here.p  pFirst thing I did was I deleted my branch locally I dont have any changes to commit.  I pulled a fresh copy from the repo and tried the merge again.  I got the same error.  I was hoping it would be solved bc from what I found already I think that should have done it.p  pThen things got strange.

Negative 190 pI know that this question has already been asked a couple of time but any answers helped me to fixed my own problem. Like I said I am working on OSX Mavericks and I would like to use tomcat with Eclipse JEE. Here is exactly what I did    I downloaded Eclipse JEE for mac.   I downloaded Apache 7.0.47 on a hrefhttptomcat.apache.orgdownload70.cgi relnofollowhttptomcat.apache.orgdownload70.cgia  I put my folder in Libraryapachetomcat7.0.47 and I created a symbolic link in this same folder that I named tomcat  I tryied to configure it with Eclipse but when I start the server an error message occur   Port 8080 required by Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost is already in use. The server may already be running in another process, or a system process may be using the port. To start this server you will need to stop the other process or change the port numbers.p  pDo you know which process is using the port 8080 on mac OS and how to kill it p  ul liI tried to start the server on another port by changing it in eclipse in port 8081.

I dont ever touch passenger until I deploy.li liIs my development environment correctli liProduction deployment is simply moving a rails application under the effects of Passenger coupled with an Apache VHOSTli ol  h2Background I suggest you readh2  pIt seems that all the information on the web is concerned about explaining things for people who already know what they are doing, rather than explaining in detail how things work its just a series of installation steps and that has left me extremely confused on the role of things, and how to setup a development environment and deploy a RoR application correctly  so please bear with this long question.p  pFor the past 3 days I have been trying to setup a development environment on my Macbook Pro that isnt destroyed by Apples rediculous limits on Apache installations. I installed a custom Apache install from bitnami using their ruby stack, since I refuse to use Server.app so that I can run Apache and upgrade things like PHP to 5.5 easily, and that works fine.p  pI am trying to get into RoR but so far it has been a struggle, and I am about ready to give up.p  pI understand you need Apache to serve Rails applications so that the server can handle requests concurrently rather than one at a time, and that various interfaces for this exist like Thin or whatever Passenger was highly recommended.p  pI installed Passenger via their instructions and did some hackery to compile it for the Bitnami passenger installation, rather than the default Apache on Mac OS X  and its working. When I start apache and run codepassengermemorystatscode I get results expected from the installation guide, so that tells me passenger is running.p  pHowever, when I try and deploy a simple hello world Rails application I get a slew of Were sorry or no result at all and just a blank page.p  pI am fairly sure my development environment is correct, everything works except this last bit. I can picture development taking place on a pow.cx server, and once deployment is ready you simply copy the Rails application and configure Apaches VHOST to point to your readytodeploy app while Passenger handles the rest, is that correctp  pI am using PostgresSQL via the Postgress.app, the server works fine and I can connect to it.p  pI have codegem pgcode in my Gemfile.p  pI have already read, and tried every conceivable solution from the following SO questions, but I either get no result or empty logs which is infuriating to say the leastp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10513450weresorrybutsomethingwentwrongwithrailsapachepassengerWe39re sorry, but something went wrong.  with Rails, Apache, Passengerali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7689097rubyonrailshowcanieditdatabaseymlforpostgresqlRuby on Rails How can i edit database.yml for postgresqlali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7304576howdoisetupthedatabaseymlfileinrailsHow do I set up the database.yml file in Railsali lia hrefhttpswww.rubyforum.comtopic187128 relnofollowhttpswww.rubyforum.comtopic187128ali ul  pSo with all that said, I am trying to deploy this hello world application which works on a standard rails server using the followingp  h2INVOKING APPLICATION VIAh2  precodehttpdmarket.local8081 codepre  h2VHOSTSh2  precodeltVirtualHost 8081gt      PassengerEnabled on      RailsEnv production     ErrorLog Applicationsrubystackapache2htdocshelloworldprojecterror.log     CustomLog Applicationsrubystackapache2htdocshelloworldprojecterror.log combined      ServerName dmarket.local8081     ServerAlias www.dmarket.local8081     DocumentRoot Applicationsrubystackapache2htdocshelloworldpublic      PassengerPreStart httpdmarket.local8081      ltDirectory Applicationsrubystackapache2htdocshelloworldpublicgt          Allow from all         Options MultiViews      ltDirectorygt  ltVirtualHostgt codepre  h2HOSTS FILEh2  precode127.0.0.1   dmarket.local 127.0.0.1   www.dmarket.local codepre  h2DATABASE.YML same for development, test, and productionh2  precode  adapter postgresql   encoding unicode   host 127.0.0.1   port 5432   database tsujp   pool 5   username tsujp   password  codepre

Suppose you wanted to aggregate the data set into a single dayseller observations, and you wished to do so based upon which product sold the most volume. To be clear, this would be simple for the volume measure, simply pass a max function to agg. However for evaluating which Product and Price would remain would mean determining which volume measure was highest and then returning the value tha corresponds with that max value.p  pI am able to get the result I want by using the index values in the column that is passed to the function when agg is called and referencing the underlying data framep  precodedef AggFuncx, df, col1         Create list of index values that index the data in the column passed as x     IndexVals  listx.index          Use those index values to create a list of the values of col1 in those index positions in the underlying data frame.

Negative 190 pI have a general question, and for that I will give an example  assuming Alice and Bob chose the prime number 593 and a public g 9 . Alice choose the number 530.  Bob choose the number 147. p  pAlice computes x ga mod p  574 Bob computes y  gb mod p  527 Their shared key is 156p  pNow Eve is trying to crack the key and find a. She has a cracking function, and she finds c such that gc mod p x  In our exmaple, c  234, but this is not the original a that Alice chose, so she still didnt succeed. My question is is there a way she finds out the original a of Alice, using this information that Eve has c, g, p  and x, and she knows that gc mod p x p  pMaybe by inverse function, I dont know..

Negative 190 pI have a specific question regarding the utilization of three tables in a database.  Table 1 is called Personnel, and lists the names of the staff.p  pTables 2 and 3 are identical, just listing two different types of overtime long and short, along with the hours of the OT, Date of the OT, and Assigned toPicked fields that are empty.p  pHere is the idea, I just dont know how to implement it.  I would like to create a form for people to enter their OT picks, then automatically move to the next person on the list.  So Rich Riphon, as an example, would be up first, would click on the link I would send, and a form would open up, showing his name, populated by the first table, and showing two drop down menus, populated from the Long OT and Short OT tables.  He would select one from each or None, which would be a option and Submit it.  p  pThe form action would be to place his name in the Assigned field for the OT he picked, and place a Yes in the Picked field.  p  pWhen the next person in the list opens the form, it has moved down to number 2 on the Personnel list, Cheryl Peterson, and shows her the remaining OT selections excluding those that have a Yes in the Picked column.p  pAny suggestions or comments or better ways to do this would be appreciated p  pThanksp  pJerryp

Negative 190 pOn the jQuery UI site, it says that By default, sortable items share draggable properties. I assumed this meant that all events that draggable has, sortable should inherit as well. However, this doesnt seem to be the case. I need something like the drag event in draggable for a sortable grid so that I can manually update the x and y values of an element thats being dragged. So far, Ive been able to get the X and Y values of the dragged element using the mousemove event and some flags, but I cant get it so that the X and Y values can be set. When I try to set the values, they simply get reset by the next time the event is fired it probably happens just after the mousemove event. Does anybody know of a way to accomplish thisp  pHere is a fiddle for what Ive tried so far a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netturtlewaxer1100CUXxn5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netturtlewaxer1100CUXxn5ap  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classrow grid span8gt     ltdiv classwell span2 tilegtAltdivgt     ltdiv classwell span2 tilegtBltdivgt     ltdiv classwell span2 tilegtCltdivgt     ltdiv classwell span4 tilegtDltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.placeholder      border 1px solid green     backgroundcolor white     webkitboxshadow 0px 0px 10px 888     mozboxshadow 0px 0px 10px 888     boxshadow 0px 0px 10px 888  .tile      height 100px     width 100px  .grid      margintop 1em  codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precodevar dragging  false  function       .grid.sortable         start dragging  functione, ui            return dragging  true         ,         stop dragging  functione, ui            return dragging  false         ,         tolerance pointer,         revert invalid,         placeholder span2 well placeholder tile,         forceHelperSize true,           Drag doesnt work as an event in sortable.         drag function                       console.logDrag fired                     My attempt at a custom drag event. can get values, but cant set them.     document.mousemovefunctione         ifdraggingtrue                       Grab the sortable element being moved.              element  .uisortablehelper               Show the current X and Y values. get reset after manually setting them below             console.logbefore X   element.cssleft  , Y   element.csstop                  Change the X and Y values to something arbitrary.             element.cssleft,0             element.csstop,0               Show the X and Y values after the change.              console.logafter X   element.cssleft  , Y   element.csstop                 codepre
Negative 190 pLooking for the best way to implement a C program that will be able to listen and send across TCP a client server. Im fairly new to networking stuff so Ill give a brief explanation of what I want to do, and how I thought to do it.p  pWhat I want Ok, so the GUI Ive made has a text box and 2 buttons more complex in actuality, but if I can get this to work I can get mine to workthe text box will hold a value read from the TCP, for me its a voltage integer read from a remote power monitoring system. On the GUI the user should be getting uptodate refresh of the current voltage, AND the buttons are used to increase or decrease the voltage by 1. SO the system needs to always be listening, and be able to talk.p  pHow I thought may work Have the program always listening for an updated value to put in txt box. If the user presses a button, the button interrupt will make TCP 1stop listening, 2send increasedecrease request, 3resume listening.p  pMy Questions 1is my idea on how to structure it ok or is there a more efficientsimplerbetter way of going about thisp  p2 Im not so sure on how to set up a ClientServerClientServer in TCP on C, is there any reccomended documentationtutorialsp  pFor testing purposes Ill just be communicating between 2 instances of the GUI on my 1 PC.p

Negative 190 pI have done some googling on it but to no avail.p  pMy scenario is that I have a helper method that takes some options and then renders a commonly used graphical element on the page through a partial, tweaked by the sent in options. Much of these options have different overridable defaults set by the helper, based on the first two required arguments  emobjectem and emcontextem.p  precodedef myhelperobject, context, options       defaults   ...      defaults[foo]  bar if object.isaSomeObject     defaults[ping]  pong if context.eqlsomecontext     ...     render partial pathtopartial, locals defaults.mergeoptions end codepre  pWhile the emcontextem is all nice and dandy, I have decided to move away from looking at the emobjectem class and, where plausible, use coderespondtocode rather. What I want to avoid though is having multiple codeif object.respondtofoo ampamp object.foocode, and just use something like codeif object.respondtoandsendfoocode, which would return nil if the object cannot respond to the method.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongbr I forgot to mention that this is a Rails 3.2 application, which is a shame since the updated codetrycode method in Rails 4, as mentioned in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma20661665638254Holger Justs answera, is exactly what I need.p

Negative 190 pToday was the first time that I tried  and failed  to symbolicate a crash log on a newly bought MacBook lets call this machine MB1. MB1 came with Mac OS X 10.9 preinstalled. I tracked the problem of the failing symbolication down to Spotlight not indexing any of my code.dSYMcode bundles without the Spotlight index, Apples codesymbolicatecrashcode script fails to locate the code.dSYMcode bundle that matches the crash log. I came to my conclusion becausep  precodemdfind comapplexcodedsymuuids   codepre  pdoes not print anything, although I have several code.xcarchivecode bundles in my codeLibraryDeveloperXcodeArchivescode folder, and they definitely contain code.dSYMcode subbundles whose UUID I can print with codedwarfdump uuidcode. I also have a couple of code.dSYMcode bundles inside my projects build folder codeDerivedDatacode, but none of them are indexed either.p  pThe short and easy question therefore is How can I tell Spotlight to index my .dSYM bundlesp  hr  pIn case there is no easy answer for this easy question, here is what I have already tried on MB1p  ul liCheck permissions of files and folders in codeLibraryDeveloperXcodeArchivescode they are all OK, 755 for folders, 644 for filesli liRun codemdimport LibraryDeveloperXcodeArchivescode has no effectli liIn System Preferences  Spotlight  Privacy first add and then remove the codeLibraryDeveloperXcodeArchivescode folder has no effect eitherli liCheck with codemdutil s code that indexing is enabled for the volume it isli liErase and rebuild the entire index codemdutil E code takes maybe 1015 minutes, but still has no effectli ul  hr  pTo go into more detail I have an older MacBook lets call this machine MB2 that was my dev machine before I switched to MB1. On MB2 I never had any trouble with symbolicating. MB2 had Mac OS X 10.8 installed while I was still actively developing on it, but I recently upgraded MB2 to Mac OS X 10.9.p  pToday, running codemdfindcode on MB2 still gives me a lot of code.dSYMcode bundles, both from the codeArchivescode folder and from the projects codeDerivedDatacode build folder. These are all old files from the Mac OS X 10.8 days, but apparently Spotlight keeps its index across OS upgrades. I thought it would be interesting to see how Spotlight behaves when new files are created, so I did the followingp  ol liFire up Xcode on MB2, create a new archive, and run codemdfindcode. This finds the intermediate code.dSYMcode bundle inside the codeDerivedDatacode build folder.li liDelete the intermediate code.dSYMcode bundle and run codemdfindcode again. No results this time, i.e. the code.dSYMcode bundle inside the codeArchivescode folder is NOT foundli liMake a copy of the code.xcarchivecode bundle created in step 1 and place the copy in the root of the user home directory. Run codemdfindcode. This finds the code.dSYMcode subbundle within the copied code.xcarchivecode bundleli ol  pAt this point, I jumped to the conclusion that because codeLibrarycode is a hidden folder this is what prevents Spotlight from indexing stuff within it. This can be easily confirmed by creating a regular file inside codeLibrarycode and searching for it no hits, then moving the file outside of codeLibrarycode and searching again 1 hit. Unfortunately, this theory falls flat on its nose because of two reasonsp  ul licodeLibrarycode was already hidden in Mac OS X versions prior to 10.9, but this never prevented Spotlight from indexing code.dSYMcode filesli liThe hidden flag is not all that keeps Spotlight from indexing stuff in codeLibrarycode If I unhide the folder with codechflags nohidden Librarycode, that does not make the regular file visible to Spotlight.li ul  hr  pBack to MB1 I tried to repeat step 3 from above, i.e. make a copy of the code.xcarchivecode bundle in the root of the users home directory, then run codemdfindcode. Surprisingly, on MB1, the result is different from MB2 codemdfindcode still finds no code.dSYMcode bundles whatsoeverp  hr  pAt this point I give up and hope for your help. My conclusion is that Mac OS X 10.9 is somehow responsible for my problems, but for the life of me I cant figure out why this is so. In case it helps, here are a few additional configuration detailsp  ul liMB1 Xcode 5.0.2 and Xcode 4.6 are installed, 5.0.2 is the default set with codexcodeselectcode. Also installed is Homebrew. The system is a clean install of Mac OS X 10.9.li liMB2 Xcode 4.5, 4.6 and 5.0 are installed, 4.6 is the default. Also installed is MacPorts. The system is an upgrade install of Mac OS X 10.9 previously installed .li ul

Negative 190 pI have an Express app and I use domains per each request received.

Im doing this cause I cant pass codereqcode directly to this code. This strange code is a kind of crossenvironment code for browser and for node which doesnt knows where it is executed. Under the hood, some base layers are implemented differently for Node and for browser, especially network code. For browser it is an XMLHttpRequest and for NodeJS it is a custom wrapper based on coderequestcode lib.p  pIm worrying about memory leaks. That references to codereqcode stored on domain. Can they keep this things and get them not garbage collected p  pAlso, do I need to dispose domains on a regular basis, or do I need to dispose them in some edgeerror casesp

Negative 190 pI am trying to do some local development on various toy projects for learning purposes.  I have Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2008 R2 10.50.1617.0 and Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web installed on my machine.  Projects using things such as Membership and Entity Framework codefirst approach are failing to create databases.  SSMS is configured to make connections to an external server with a bunch of my companys DBs on it, but I cannot connect to the local machines SQL Server instance, which might be because it doesnt exist.p  pThere is definitely no MSSQLSERVER service listed in the services list, which I assumed meant no instance of SQL Server was installed locally even though I assumed VS 2013 or SSMS would have installed MSSQLSERVER.  This led me to download a copy of SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB, but when I tried to install it, it failed, giving the following errorp  blockquote   pemInstallation of SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB failed because a higher version already exists on the machine.  To proceed, uninstall the higher version and then run SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB Setup again.emp blockquote  pSo I guess my question is, do I really have SQL Server installed  If so, how do I start the service which is not even appearing in the services list so that I can connect to it locallyp

My issue is that I keep getting an error saying that my HelloCedarville.class file cannot be found. p  pI have tried many things to get this to workp  ol liAt first I tried this without a java package, in other words the .class file was directly under WEBINFclasses, but this didnt work.li liNext I tried it using a java package as many of the answers to similar questions suggested to use a java package. I made sure the compiled java class HelloCedarville.class is under WEBINFclassescom, and that package com is at the top of HelloCedarville.java. li liI have checked my web.xml file multiple times to make sure that I mapped to the servlet correctly. li liI tried recompiling the java file and retesting to see if it can find the .class file.li liI tried deleting both HelloCedarville.java and HelloCedarville.class and recreating them.li ol  pI just cant figure out what is causing this error.

Negative 190 pI have created a Xamarin solution in Visual Studio 2013 with the following structurep  precodeSOLUTION     CORE  PCL     Android     iOS     WindowsPhone codepre  pTheoretically, the platformspecific projects will only contain GUI code XAML for WP, axml for Android, and whatever iOS uses  I as yet know nothing about the Cupertinians way of doing things all the logic business and data code, ampc will reside in the CorePCL folder, with each of the platform projects referencing that.p  pHowever, it seems that there is sort of a middle ground code that is not GUI but also cannot be shared, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22570498whatmodernpclequivalentforhandshakexonxoffprinting codea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22615794whatneedidotogetthiscodeto20workinaportableclasslibraryfile IOa, and these are probably just the nostrils of the bathing hippo.p  pIOW, the CORE  PCL folder is shared, but the code apparently still needs to be branched off within that, based on which platformdevice is calling it. To put it in real estate or sociological terms, the CorePCL area is a multiplex with separate private quarters, not a common area where lions lie down with lambs, diversity is celebrated, etc.p  pThe promised communal bliss thus becomes an every man for himself type of compound, with armed guards restricting access to the starbellied sneeches area, etc.p  pWhat is the common way to handle this sharedonthesurfacebutnotreally scenario Is Dependency Injection the answer, or...p  h2UPDATEh2  pIn fact, based on what I see a hrefhttpdocs.xamarin.comguidescrossplatformapplicationfundamentalspclintroductiontoportableclasslibraries relnofollowherea, it may be that separatecodeforeachscenario isnt even possible when using PCL it says there, emBecause the same Portable Class Library is shared between multiple applications, platformspecific libraries cannot be referenced eg. Community.CsharpSqlite.WP7.emp  pIs this really so If so, the advantage of using PCL is greatly reduced, as it is truly a lowest common denominator sort of approach, not unlike the lambastedbyXamarin HTMLJavaScript approach used by rivals such as the a hrefhttpphonegap.com20120509phonegapbeliefsgoalsandphilosophy relnofollowsuicidal PhoneGapa emThe ultimate purpose of PhoneGap is to cease to exist.em.p  pBut then again, that same page also says thisp  pemTo some extent both disadvantages can be circumvented using the Provider pattern or Dependency Injection to code the actual implementation in the platform projects against an interface or base class that is defined in the Portable Class Library.emp  pSo I reckon I live near Carmel, so I say reckon often in [d,r]eference to that most famous of all Carmelites, Clint Eastwood that the other viable option is Filelinking as they say emthere are two major approaches to code sharing in this manner filelinking and Portable Class Library PCL projects.em.p

Negative 190 pSorry for asking such a basic question, I have just come across Vaadin, it looks like a interesting way of creating web applications.

Negative 190 pIm writing my first Android application, and have utilized the Android Location Manager to obtain GPS readings. I a bit confused about the accuracy readings Im getting. For examplep  ol lipI used a tape to measure out 1000 linear feet between two points. pli lipWhile standing at point A I started the location manager update requests until I received an accuracy of  4 feet. pli lipI then hit a button in the app to save that particular location private var.pli lipWhile the location manager continues to poll I walked the line until I reached point B. pli lipOnce here I waited for an accuracy reading of  4 feet.  pli lipI then hit another button which takes that location and performs a distance measurement between the two points i.e.p  pdouble distance  startLocation.distanceToendLocationpli lipThe returned distance measurement was 1000.20 feet. pli ol  pI realize that the returned accuracy measurement from the GPS is constantly fluctuating, but I expected that the distance measurement would at least reflect this somewhat.

Negative 190 pI am using the deprecated System.Data.OracleClient from Microsoft to perform some remote querying of Oracle tables. I am technically unable to use the Oracleprovided ODP providers, regrettably, for reasons that arent relevant here. p  pIn performing a query, I would like to get the string representation of the Oracle type for a given column, and am relying on the GetSchemaTable method of the OraceDataReader to have this information. Im finding several things that are emcloseem, but not what Im really looking for. This seems almost a ridiculously simple request.p  pIve tried several things that seemed hopeful, but were red herrings I found the codeSchemaTableOptionalColumn.ProviderSpecificDataTypecode column to return the emMicrosoft providerem type name eg. codeSystem.Data.OracleClient.OracleNumbercode, but all I want is the literal column type as defined in Oracle, eg codeNVARCHARcode or codeNUMBERcode. I thought perhaps the codeProviderTypecode property, which returns a number, would map to the codeOracleTypecode enumeration in the provider, but it doesnt. The other hope, codeDataTypecode really maps more to the corresponding managed type of the column, which isnt what Im looking for, either. p  pI thought surely someone has solved this before, but if they have, Ive not yet found the right rock under which to look for it p
Negative 190 pHey all I am trying to figure out why my expander does not expand the second time I click on it.

Negative 190 pWeve got a project site where we have to replicate a legacy database system into SQL Server 2008 on a nightly basis.p  pWe are using the SQL DataWizard tool from Maestro to do the job, and because we cannot get an accurate delta every night, it was decided that we would dump the previous SQL Server database and take a fresh snapshot every night. Several million rows in about 10 different tables. The snapshot takes about 2 hours to run.p  pNow, we also need to create some custom indexes on the snapshot copy of the data, so that certain BI tools can query the data quickly.p  pMy question is is it more efficient to create the tables AND the indexes before the snapshot copy is run, or do we just create the table structures first, run the snapshot copy then create the indexes after the tables are populatedp  pIs there a performance different in the SQL Server database building the index WHILE adding rows vs adding all rows first then creating the indexes on the final data setp  pJust trying to work out which way will result in less database server CPU overhead.p

What I have to do is break TableA in 5 chunks using Sorting amp LIMITs 20 each. Now I know I can update TableAs data based on this limit easily. However, I cant sort and limit the other tables because they dont have the sort data  they simply have the IDs from Table A.p  pIs there a fast way I can do this Do I have to collect all the IDs and use the IN operator Do I have to join all the tables using the IDs and then update Whats the best query I could use to do this fastp

I have to sign my message with a X509 certificate, which I do using WSS4J.p  pUsing a custom handler I print the signed messaged to file and everything looks good. The message is divided over three lines, because of the two newline characters in the message signature.

Negative 190 pI have a problem after refactoring code of Test Application backend. Test has questions and answers, each question has multiple answers and only one of them is correct.p  pAfter some debugging everything seems to work fine, but all questions and answers managing logic was located in one controller. I moved answers logic to separate nested controller and after that stuck with this problem. Tried different methods but none of them helped.p  pThe goal is to combine Angular UI Tree Example 4  Groups amp Categories with Angular UI Bootstrap Modal.p  pBy design adding and editing questions and answers are happening in modal window. The template is located separately so its not repeated with each question and answer. When provided data is not valid, validation errors are shown, otherwise the success alert is shown and all fields clear and back to default state all that happens inside the modal window, its stay opened and can be closed only by hitting Cancel, X button or keyboard Esc button.p  pI need to update codeQuestionsCtrl scope.questionscode from modal window trigger button is located inside template of modal window. After hitting Add button codescope.questionscode will become updated in scope and the ui.tree is also updated in background. The success alert or validation errors doesnt shown, form fields doesnt clear. Repeated clicks is not calling the actual function again so it runs only once.p  pWithout modal window but with nested controllers adding works fine.p  pI created a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditmLTOd0WwBhlYsUMXW16Vppreview relnofollowplunka and removed all redundant code so focusing on the problem will be easier. I can provide more code if its needed. For example in the plunk results of codeconsole.logcode shown only once.p

Everything seemed to run OK and looked OK.p  pOver the course of the next few days I was making amendments to the project I am working on but only put the changes CSS into a codecustom.csscode file. I was wanting to ensure my client was happy with my proposed design before getting into the guts of SASS.p  pThis evening I came to make the changes to SASS. I ran codecompass watchcode before I made any changes and I was immediately met withp  pcodewrite stylesheetsapp.csscodep  pThis totally screwed up my codeindex.htmlcode despite not having made any changes. The codeapp.csscode file is only a fraction of the original size 750 lines vs. 8,500 and as a result the page is pretty much loading as raw HTML with no useful CSS  theres not even a hint of any styling on codebodycode for example.p  pAfter deciding to reinstall from scratch Im still no better off and running into very much the same issue.p  pAccording to Foundationp  blockquote   pstrongapp.scssstrong    Here you can determine what stylings will be in your project.   strongBy default all of Foundation is importedstrong, but you can deactivate and   select specific components you want to import or add your custom Sass   here.p blockquote  pWhen I first installed Foundation, it was all imported as the default styles loaded for my codeindex.htmlcode.

Negative 190 pIve been scouring the internet and MSDN websites, trying to wrap my head around this whole animation deal, and Im at a bit of a loss.

That works. It also makes the path shrink when you click the button again. However, I want something extra. When I click the button while its growing, I would like the animation to turn around right where it is and begin shrinking, and viceversa. Currently, when I click during the animation it will skip to the end of the currentlyrunning animation, and then begin to shrink, making the shape pop, so to speak, and not make a smooth transition from growing to shrinking. Id like it to be smooth.p  pThe way I see this working is to access the animation within the storyboard, set the codeTocode of the a new animation to the codeFromcode of the running one, then set the codeTargetPropertycode value of the running animation to the codeFromcode of the new one. Then, set the codeDurationcode of the new one to the difference between the base duration and the current time of the running one. Then make the new one run. However, I dont know how to access the animations from codebehind, which needs to happen, as this entire thing runs from a button click.p  pOnce helped with this, I should be able to know how to use the GetValue method of the StoryBoard class to fetch the properties of its Animation children, as well as be able to bind some codeTextBlockcodes to those Animation properties, just so I can see if they update in realtime.p  pSorry this is so longwinded, but I have been working on this for two days, and I have no way of how to make this query concise. Im not sure if Ive even explained it well. Can someone help me with thisp

Negative 190 pA codeprotectedcode variable is access to any class within a package and only to a subclass that codeextendscode the base class outside the package.p  pWhy did Java implemented this in this was i.e default within package instead of codeprivatecode within packagebr This is defeating the whole purpose of having blocking access to your variables.p  pThe definition of protected access modifier in java is that if you define codeclassAcode has a codeprotectedcode variable codexcode  then codexcode is visible to every class in the same package and it is also visible to any class outside the codepackagecode but codeextends classAcode. I feel that within the package level it should be codeprivatecode instead of default access. I am sure Java might have a good reason behind it, and I want to know what this might be.p

Negative 190 pI have a very simple setup using MSF from one client PC to one remote PC. Both are running SQL Server 2008 Express. The purpose is simply to send the data from a local server where the data is being collected at a competition to a web server for display.p  pHowever, this weekend I hit a situation where the local database is now continuously uploading 4 records to the remote database.  There are no error messages at this point and the sync apparently completes, but next time I run it again, it reports 4 records uploaded, even though there have been  no changes to the local database. p  pThe data is transferred over a 34G link and there are occasionally dropouts on the link, but in the past Sync has recovered on the next iteration.  The only error message I saw that was unusual was Cannot Enumerate Changes at the RelationalSyncProvider for tableHorses.  Ironically this is one table that doesnt change during the day But it does contain 4 records  hmmm.  p  pI have tried backup and restore to another SQL instance on my development machine SQL Server 2008 R2, have run fixup and then Sync to the remote and I get the same situation of 4 records uploaded and now 1 downloaded, with no errors, but again the same record counts every time I run  and I know nothing is being updated.p  pAs far as I can tell the data is in Sync as I cant see any obvious anomalies, but that is hard to be certain of.p  pSo ...p  ol lipCan I tell which records are the issuebeing uploadedpli lipWhat can I do to ensure the data has in fact syncedpli lipWhat can I do to reset so that the two databases know they are actually in Sync, preferably short of backup and restorepli ol  pThanks in advance Nickp
Negative 190 pI am using a USB hub GL850G chipset with an external power supply for the devices conencted to a Debian 7.6 PC.p  pIf the hub is powered and then connected to the computer, all the devices work properly. But if the power to the hub is removed and reconnected again the devices are not reconnected.p  pI tried with lsusb and I can only see the hub being present on the bus. On Linux the problem can be solved by unplugging and replugging the hub USB connector but unfortunately the system is meant for remote operations. I tried restarting udev, using udevadm but with no luck. Rebooting the computer generally fixes the problem even if once it did not work but I would like to avoid such a solution.p  pI also tried with the same setup with a Windows 7 computer and, after a power cycle, all the devices are normally reenumerated.p  pIs there a way to force device reenumeration or just reenumerate the devices attached to the hub under Linux I have a custom C application connecting to the USB devices, so I may execute a comamnd line application or add some C code to my application.p

Negative 190 pThe problem Design a SavingsAccount class that stores a savings accounts annual interest rate and balance. The class constructor should accept the amount of the savings accounts starting balance. The class should also have methods for subtracting the amount of a withdrawal, adding the amount of a deposit, and adding the amount of monthly interest to the balance. The monthly interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by twelve. To add the monthly interest to the balance, multiply the monthly interest rate by the balance, and add the result to the balance.p  pTest the class in a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a period of time. It should ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting balance, and the number of months that have passed since the account was established. A loop should then iterate once for every month, performing the followingp  pAsk the user for the amount deposited into the account during the month. Use the class method to add this amount to the account balance. Ask the user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month. Use the class method to subtract this amount from the account balance. Use the class method to calculate the monthly interest. After the last iteration, the program should display the ending balance, the total amount of deposits, the total amount of withdrawals, and the total interest earned.p  pI keep getting one issue in the Main Program on line 22, that if I fix, it messes up a bunch of the code.

Negative 190 pIm a C developer using VS 2012 and VS 2010 for developing AAA titles. I have read about not using STL and other stuff provided in the standard headers that come with VS. I read most of the stuff on the websites based on game programming and some are really from the people well known in the industry. I have seen cases where they wont even use vector, list, map and others and not even use utility functions and algorithms. In such cases they write those containers and stuff themselves which has almost the same interface and so much of debug and implementation time spent on such huge code.p  pI have two questionsp  p1 Isnt the C implementation that comes with VS optimized for the platform for better performance Isnt it using some intrinsic functions that people on the client end doesnt know about and supplying their own implementation would indeed be more slower in basic container operations such as insert, remove, find, swap, copy Lets assume that we supply our own custom allocators for faster memory management to every container that we use. Also, they take care of fragmentation, alignment and stuff. Why develop custom containers with almost same interface, why not spend that time on writing allocators and other stuff that might actually helpp  p2 There are times when we include a lot, a lot, of unnecessary stuff through the standard headers in a huge code base. Unnecessary, because we only needed a thing or two from such huge headers including other huge headers and so on. Now, I know templates arent instantiated unless used, same goes for the members functions inside them and blah blah. Since, these are precompiled headers, it is safe to assume that there is no compile time hit for that unnecessary stuff. My question is, is there any hidden effect of such inclusions on code size executable that grows with the huge growth of the code base In my opinion there shouldnt be, but I wanna know Im not mistaken just in case. p  pThanksp

Negative 190 pstrongSituationstrongp  pI am writing an image compositor, and I am using FBOs.p  pAs gl can not read a texture that it is currently writing to, currently I am using a pseudo Fbo Flip Chain logic. I create a list of about 10 FBO and each time I render I move to the next FBO which can happily read from one of the previous FBO textures. p  pHowever this is deeply flawed because of the way I am currently doing my composting an fbo can be overwritten when it is still needed in its current state. I tied a lockingunlocking logic but it is flakey.p  pAn image currently goes through the following stagesp  ul liDraw The Image to a texture using fbo ul lifbo flipli ulli liComposite all of the Images children onto imagebr ul lifbo flip for each child strongthis is the issuestrongli ulli liconvert the image to the destination type ul lifbo flipli ulli liBlend the image with its destination ul lifbo flipli ulli lipass texture along for composting with siblingsli ul  pI have decided to refactor this flip chaincompositing idea.

Negative 190 pI have a PLSQL package in an 11g database that looks up various attributes and deals with group memberships and so forth. One function in particular is a pipelined function that returns all the members of a group specified in the a function parameter. It works great for groups with less than 1000 members. In that case, I get this error message p  blockquote   pORA31202 DBMSLDAP LDAP clientserver error Sizelimit exceededp blockquote  pI understand that LDAP and MS Active Directory in particular, which is what I am dealing with has a query result set size limit of 1000. If an LDAP search results in more than this many entries, the query just fails and returns no results. I do not have the option of modifying the AD schema or anything like that. I know that there is a concept of paged result sets in LDAP, but I dont see mention of that functionality in the DBMSLDAP documentation that I have reviewed.p  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1050101network.920a96577smplcode.htm relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1050101network.920a96577smplcode.htmap  pI would greatly appreciate any advice, guidance, or documentation URLs for solutions or workarounds. p  pIf query slicing is the best way, then note that starting with a query for all the top level OUs, and using them with a logical AND in the search filters might work for some situations, but there are no guarantees that there would not be 1000 or more user objects in one OU and are also members of a target security group. So it might have to be a little cleverer than just OU limiting.p

Negative 190 pI have an AJAX query on my client that passes two parameters to a serverp  precodevar url  window.location.origin  instanceStats             .getJSONurl,  unit  unit, stat  stat , functiondata      instanceData[key]  data     var count  showInstanceStatstargetElement, unit, stat, limiter  codepre  pThe server itself is a very simple Python Flask application. On that particular URL, it grabs the unit and stat parameters from the query to determine the name of a CSV file and line within that file, grabs the line, and sends the data back to the client formatted as JSON roughly 1KB.p  pHere is the funny thing When I measure the time it takes for the data to come back, I observe that some queries are fast between 20 and 40 ms, and some queries are slow between 320 and 350 ms. Varying the stat parameter i.e. selecting a different line in the CSV doesnt seem to have any impact. The fast and slow queries usually switch back and forth i.e. all even queries are fast, all odd ones are slow. The Python server itself reports roughly the same time for each query.p  pAJAX itself doesnt seem to have any impact either, as I can take the url that is constructed in the JS and paste it into the browser myself and get the same behavior. Here are some measurements from two subsequent queriesp  pFast a hrefhttpi.imgur.comVQ7qopd.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comVQ7qopd.pngap  pSlow a hrefhttpi.imgur.comYuG0ROM.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comYuG0ROM.pngap  pThis seems to be Chromespecific, as Ive tried it on Firefox and the same experiment yields roughly the same query time everytime between 30 and 50 ms.

Negative 190 pI am trying to write a .tgz file containing tens if not hundreds of thousands of file entries, the contents of each of which have come from a string in a database. Each file entry is about 25k of data.p  pI want to avoid doing this without having to write the files out first. Currently I have PHP creating a traditional directory structure, writing files, then making a tgz from that at the very end using a shellexec.p  pThe disk we are using is slow and so writing tens of thousands of files is taking ages. Even running a prototype on another machine with a fast disk using a tmpfs ramdisk and lots of CPU, I get a rate of about 100200 file entries per second, which feels slow  half an hour for 150,000 files in a directory structure. Once that has been written, the actual conversion from the native OS directory structure to tgz is not problematic.p  pI was hoping to use PharData to do the writing. However, PharDataaddFromString seems to do a file write as soon as the file is added, rather than an an OpenAddWriteout pattern.p  pCan anyone suggest any strategies herep  pThe eventual tgz file is then to be made available for download, and will not be refreshed often. But because there are a series of these files to be created, having to wait 3060 minutes just to package it becomes quite a blocker.p

Negative 190 pIf it makes any difference, this is in AWS China.p  pI have a new EC2 instance. I created it a couple of days ago. Its supposed to be an application server for a rails app. Apache is up and running, and it works curl localhost works. When I try from another EC2 instance, it also responds OK using the EC2 internal IP address. p  pHowever, if I use the external IP address it doesnt work. It times out.p  pThings I checkedp  ul liApache is running, and its listening on eth0 as well as localhost.li liNo firewall in the instance default Amazon Linux image, iptables L returns all ACCEPT policies, no other rules.li liSecurity group is correct. It has rules for inbound port 80 and port 443 allowed for the whole world.li liThe security group Im modifying is indeed applied to the instance with issues. I tried removing SSH access from that security group and my ssh connection into the server died. Added access again and I was able to ssh in. So the security group is working and applying rules.li liI even tried setting up a load balancer in front of the instance. The load balancer cant reach the instance either.li liYes, Im using the correct IP address. I checked it over and over again.li liI tried using the public hostname, it still doesnt work why should it, but it confirms I have the right IP address because it does work from inside the instance because inside AWS it points to the internal IP address.li ul  pIm completely stumped on this. Its possible that its a really silly mistake on my part, but Ive already tried everything I could come up with. I googled and tried everything other people said worked for them. I had a coworker look into it, he also couldnt make it work.p  pSo, any ideas What am I missingp  pThanksp  pEdit a coworker suggested something which made total sense what if I listen in a different port Does it work then Turns out it does. Configured Apache to listen in port 9876, opened it in the security group, and of course, it works. So its just port 80 which is filtered. My next step was creating a load balancer which listens on port 80 and forwards to port 9876 to the instance. And, of course, it doesnt work. The LB connects to the instance, says its online, but I cant reach the LB in port 80. So it seems I cant reach anything on AWS China on port 80, and Im still totally blocked here.p

Negative 190 pId like extend Windsors Typed Factory Facility to create a factory which retains some state, e.g. properties on the factory itself that will be used to resolve dependencies on the things the factory creates. Kind of like a Typed Builder Facility.p  pSo, I would define my factory interface like so...p  precodepublic interface IFishBuilder      string FishType  get set      double SwimSpeed  get set       IFish CreateFishstring name     void ReleaseFishIFish fish  codepre  pThis would create components like this...p  precodeclass Fish  IFish      public Fishstring name, string fishType, double swimSpeed            codepre  pAnd be used like so...p  precodeIFishBuilder b b.SwimSpeed  50 b.FishType  Shark b.CreateFishFrank b.CreateFishBob b.SwimSpeed  95 b.CreateFishUsain codepre  pNot a great example, but lets not worry too much about the use case, beyond understanding that the initialised factory will be passed to someone else that will do the creation, without understanding how it had been initialised.p  pIve made some steps in the right direction  well actually, it works OK already... However, Im pretty sure there should be a simpler way to achieve this. What I have done so far is attach a second interceptor to the factory proxy, which intercepts the setter and getter properties on the interface. My original plan was that my custom codeITypedFactoryComponentSelectorcode for the factory would then read the properties from the interceptor attached to the proxy object.p  pWhere this all falls down, of course, is that the codeITypedFactoryComponentSelectorcode interface doesnt give any way to access the proxy object that implements the factory upon which the factory method was called. This means I have no path back to calling the property getters to read the factories properties back in for the codeGetArgumentscode to access. Let me try and explain that again. The component selectors function is defined as...p  precodeFuncltIKernelInternal, IReleasePolicy, objectgt SelectComponentMethodInfo method, Type type, object[] arguments codepre  pYou get access to the method on the factory emclassem, the emtypeem and the arguments passed to the method, but not the factory emobjectem itself. Before you get clever with circular dependencies, my factories are transient.p  pMy workaround for this currently is to access the Typed Factorys interceptor in my interceptor via the proxy, and then grab hold of the component selector which therefore needs to be made transient. I then poke the property values into a dictionary held by the component selector effectively, using the component selector as the storage backing the factorys properties. However, this feels like a lot of hacky crosscoupling, which I would rather avoid.p  pSo, now I am looking for suggestions as to how to improve this.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 190 pI have application, that  implements file sharing in my company. We use PlayScalaMongoDB. To store documents in mongo we use a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualtutorialmodeltreestructureswithmaterializedpaths relnofollowmaterialize patha The file itself is stored in S3. So, folders has path like code,folder1,folder2,folder3,...code. Document in DB looks like p  precode  path ,folder1,folder2,folder3,  path of folder where document in   name documentName.txt codepre  pAnd now I need to implement security for such documents structure. In this  Security model SM strongordinary userstrong not Admin may change permission of any documents and folders, if he has FullAccess to them. He may override, modify and create new permissions.  SM consist of p  ul liPermissions  permission read,write, and so onli liPolicy  is a Map codedocmentFullPath gt List[Permission]code li liGroup  list of users with the same policiesli liUser  user may contains individual policies. li ul  pAlso, security model must implement inheritance. If user codeUcode has codeReadcode permission to folder code,folder1,folder2,code, then codeUcode has codeReadcode to all nested folders and documents in this path. p  pUser may contains individual policies. For example, user codeUcode has codeWritecode permission to folder  code,folder1,folder2,folder3,code in individual Policy. p  pAnd finally, Groups. Group codeGcode contains user codeUcode and codeFullAccesscode to path code,folder1,folder2,folder3,code. p  pIn such model I collect all permissions from inheritance, from groups and user individual related to folder path.  If user has no permissions, then he cant see documents or folders in this path. Otherwise I have some problems. Let see this case related to path code,folder1,folder2,folder3,code p  ul liuser has codeWritecode from inheritance in path code,folder1,codeli liuser has codeReadcode from inheritance in path code,folder1,folder2,codeli liuser has codeFullAccesscode permission from Group codeGcodeli liuser has codeWritecode individual permission li ul  pI dont know, what result of this case. If I decide, that individual permission is always in priority, then result will be codeWritecode. But, if I want to change Group permission  and say  user codeAcode has no longer codeWritecode to this folder, only codeReadcode , individual permission is still priority. The same problem occur when I try to change inheritance permissions.  p  pAnother problem I try to change inheritance permissions to codeWritecode. But this action will affect to group codeGcode. This group give me codeFullAccesscode to this path, but I will get codeWritecode.     p  pWhere I was wrong or how to implement such SM with a lot of users and documents  Thanks a lot p

Negative 190 pSince I am fairly new to Swift programming on OSX, this question may contain several points that needs clarification.p  pI have a method which iterates over all subviews of a given codeNSViewcode instance. For this, I get the array of subviews which is of type code[AnyObject]code and process one element at a time.p  pAt some point I would like to access the codeidentifiercode property of each instance.

In order to get that identifier I would have writtenp  precodevar view  NSView  subview as NSView var viewIdent  String  view.identifier codepre  pThe second line is marked by the compiler with an error stating that codeidentifiercode is not of an optional type, but instead of type codeStringcode, and hence the postfix operator codecode cannot be applied.p  pRemoving this operator compiles fine, but leads to a runtime error codeEXCBADACCESS code1, address0x0code because codeidentifiercode seems to be codenilcode for some codeNSButtoncode instance.p  pI cannot even test for this property, because the compiler gives me a codeString is not convertible to UInt8code while I tryp  precodeif view.identifier  nil viewIdent  view.identifier codepre  pMy questions arep  ol liIs the documentation wrong I.g. the property codeidentifiercode is not optionalli liHow can I ship around this problem and get code that runs robustli ol

Negative 190 pThis is just a hypothetical question, but could be a way to get around an issue I have been having.p  pImagine you want to be able to time a calculation function based not on the answer, but on the time it takes to calculating.

But only if it is emnotem done in Android main UI thread, because the users GUI will be become unresponsive and will throw an ANR after 5 seconds.p

Negative 190 pI have a cshtml page with some Div elements. These div elements are colored with a gradient as specified in the style classes. I also added a hover class which turns the div color slightly lighter, in effect mimicking the effect of a button and the hovering over it. The divs ultimately are used to contain text received from the MVC controller.p  pWhat I would like to do is some way in jquery perhaps to dynamically change the shading of a set of divs. I will specify the set to be red FF0000, but the rest of the divs in the set should then go a shade lighter. Something similar to the W3 color pickers Shades block a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comtagsrefcolorpicker.asp relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comtagsrefcolorpicker.aspap  pHere is a jsfiddle with what I more or less need to do.p  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netezxkf3qL1 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netezxkf3qL1ap  pYou will note that I have 2 css classes defining the color gradients, red1 and red2. If I have 6 divs within 3 sets it means I need to build 18 different color classes and their respective hover methods.p  pIdeally I would like to have one color class and one hover method class for each set. Then jquery would take the color and dynamically change the red classs gradient colors for each element so as to get the same type of effect as in my example.p  pI have tried something like this alsop  precodevar list  div.col.find.get  var step  100  list.eachfunctioni, e     var shade  i  step    this.cssbackgroundcolor, rgb255,   shade  ,  shade    codepre  pThis does change the shading, but with 6 elements it kinda gets too light or doesnt distinguish the different shading enough. Also this does not solve my problem with the gradient.p  pThis same principle would apply to the coloring of buttons or whichever other element. Maybe there is jquery that could solve all of this at the same time which I am not aware of. Any assistance would be appreciated.p

I have been able to enter the CF into the Array of data that I have in my original workbook.  Its not as simple as putting it into a table, but by manually selecting the range in each column and inputting the CF I have made it work.p  pI also wasnt sure if the formatting would carry through to the new worksheet as I have used the Paste Special command to convert the array formula to values in the new sheet.  It does, however, carry the formatting across which is very handy.p  pIts not the perfect solution for me but it appears to be working so far.  I still need to test what happens when I change the date and get updated data.  It would still be interesting to know if I can move this formatting into my macro though.  Any tipsp

Negative 190 pI am using Amazon AWS and our project uses MySQL databases. So far we are self hosting them, but we want to move that out of the instances few production workloads each running its own MySQL db and use Amazon provided ones.p  pWhat I have right now is that each server has its own mysql root password and then creates new user with new random password that is used for user.p  pMySQL state uses credentials set up in codeetcsaltminioncodep  pstrongThe problem I want to avoidstrong is having a common root password of shared DB instance that is stored in text and shared within all production instances even thought they only need to know their own.p  pthe mysql state does allow right now to manually set connection credentials for each state, meaning I can template that based on grains or pillar. That would somewhat work since I could just create each instance credentials and manually distribute them. But thats not the salt way is itp  pSo I could have an event fire to master asking to checkcreate credentials, but there is no way to respondstop state there is itp  pI cant set up a slave in mysql instance since its just an interface I am allowed to access to.p  pSo I could also salt the master and have within master configuration a state that would go over a list of minions and check credentials. Then fire it off with an event and reactor and hope that this will finish always faster than rest of the deployment. Or is there a simpler way to keep some data secret from the minion but effectively use itp
Negative 190 pWhen I run project from Visual Studio, after some time of work I see System.AccessViolationException occurred in mscorlib.dll. But on source tabs there are only Source not availible.

Is it possible to find at least small part of stack trace For now from outside it all looks like mscorlib by itself issued some call and crashed on it lol.

Negative 190 pi am currently developing a content management system with symfony and symfony cmf. i am trying to implement a sorting functionality for some nodes that are belonging to a user.p  pWhat ive figured out so far is that the nodes had to be placed in the same depth to be correctly sorted and that the elements, which are found by the documentManager, are sorted from the lowest sortorder to the highest. p  pWhat i cant figure out currently is, how the hell do i set the sortorder The AbstractBlock class was having two Methods setPosition and getPosition, but setPosition isnt implemented at all. Its just a comment with a TODO and a return this statement. p  pSo did anyone in here already managed to implement a sorting functionality with Symfony CMF If so, please let me how i can do so.p  pSharpy35p

pMy question is, I can override the settings file properties or other workaround that could make the stronguser.configstrong file really portable avoiding the problem of the directory hash p  pWell, Im pretty sure its possibly because I did it in the past with another stronguser.configstrong file of another .Net app, I cant remember exactly what I did because it was a lot of trial and error, but I think what I did was creating a new strongapp.configstrong file in the same directory of the application folder and just copying the full content of the stronguser.configstrong stored in emAppDataem directory to my new strongapp.configstrong file in the apps working dir, then editing at my desire the properties inside the strongapp.configstrong file to preserve a custom default value when the app creates the stronguser.configstrong in the emAppDataem directory for first time ran, but that technique didnt worked this time for this application strongRED2.exestrong.p  pI tried some basic ideas like adding the stronguser.configstrong in the same folder where the strongRED2.exestrong is stored then adding in the file the configuration I like, also I did the same thing creating an strongapp.configstrong, anything worked, but maybe I did something wrong during the procedure.p

Negative 190 pAllp  pI am pretty to new to Gulp and Browserify, what I did is transpile some jsx code and browserify them into a bundle.js file.p  precodevar gulp  requiregulp var browserify  requirebrowserify var source  requirevinylsourcestream var reactify  requirereactify  gulp.taskdefault, function     browserify         entries [jsapp.js],         debug true          .transformreactify     .bundle     .pipesourcebundle.js     .pipegulp.destdistjs  codepre  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHemRo.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHemRo.png altenter image description hereap  pIn app.js, I specify a few require dependencieseach one may require some other file, and I thought browserify will parse them and compile into a single bundle.js file, but when I run it, even I only include bundle.js in index.html page, it still includes all those dependency files when I check in Chrome source tab, strongI wonder if this is just Chromes feature to parse bundle file which gives me a list of dependency file list or it actually download those dependency files as wellstrong My confuse is I actually can click and open those dependency files, so I guess Chrome download them all with bundle.js, but I am not sure about thatp  pThanks p
