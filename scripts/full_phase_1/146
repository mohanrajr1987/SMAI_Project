Positive 146 pThe code below is a registration form in which before inserting data into database we check If username and email is already taken, actually it was written codephpcode codemysqlicode where it worked fine but now I am switching to PDO.

The form displays fine on the webmail platform and other email accounts not on our server display the form perfectly fine.  p  pAny help is GREATLY appreciatedp  pUPDATEp  pI went through and removed each line to see if I could try and investigate error. It seems that the problem is to do with the length of the form. If there are 10 entries or so it goes through fine regardless of what the field is but once its over 10 entries it starts giving all the weird  all over the place. Very weird. Any ideasp
Positive 146 pOur server has been injected ... the virus creates phpfiles in different folders with different names. Then these files are loaded from external HackingServers so that they generate and send SpamMails from our server ...p  pBecause of getting on blacklists, i had to disable the mailfunction, because i cant find out, where the injection comescame from and how the files are generated. Deleting the files helps for a while, but then new ones are generated ...p  pWe need the mailfunction in daily work and have no time to stop and repair it. So i need a solution that allows me to send mails from some specific files that i can define maybe path included anywhere while others the ones that are generated are blocked generally until theres some freetime left ...p  pHope you can help me out ... any other working solution is welcome as well p

Positive 146 pIf this is too broad I apologize and will understand if it needs closing. However, I couldnt find much to this specifically. Maybe Im missing something obvious. My app is already setup to catch user name and email when signing up with email confirmation. I also want an email list though that is separate from signup. For instance, I want people to be able to just sign up to the mailing list without necessarily signing up as a user on the app with names and password. I also want users who have signed up to not necessarily be on the mailing list either if they dont want to. Im just curious what the best way to go about doing this would be. Have a separate mailing list model with email and opt in opt out boolean Or maybe allow subscribers to be users without first and last name Is it bad practice to catch user emails in two different models Thanks. p

I can program this in well under 1 minute.p  pIn XcodeInterface Builder, I have to physically type a declaration for both the text box and the slider, then type a propertyoutlet declaration for each as well, then create a method declaration and implementation for the ValueChanged even, then set up a relatively complicated typecast of the sliders integer value into an NSString using initWithFormat. I then have to return to Interface Builder to link up the controls with the control and method outlets I typed in. I dont see how this can be done in much less than 10 minutes. strongMaybestrong 5.p  pSo, whats the benefit of this Why doesnt Interface Builder automatically create, or at least suggest, control declarations and property statements, as well as method declarations and implementations Why cant doubleclicking a slider in IB offer you a list of events and offer to automatically insert a skeleton method into your .h and .m file And why does IB even have to be a separate applicationp  pIm willing to accept that some of this is my unfamiliarity with all things Xcode, but is this really as efficient as the development environment can bep  pMy apologies if this is a deadhorse, flamebait topic with opposing sides on full aggro. If so, please just say yes, that it is and move on.p  pThanks, Robp

Negative 146 pIf I have some HTML that looks like thisp  precodeltdiv idtextgt       This is some text that is being written ltspan classhighlightgtwith       a highlighted sectionltspangt and some text following it. ltdivgt codepre  pAnd I want to remove the span leaving the text node within, how would I go about doing that  I tried using jQuery to do the followingp  precodewrap  .highlight wrap.children.insertBeforewrap wrap.remove codepre  pBut that doesnt work Im guessing because children returns an empty set since theres only a text node in there.  So all that happens is that the span and its contents are removed.p  pIm also open to alternatives to my approach here.  Whats happening is that my code actually creates that span when a user selects a block of text.  It wraps the selected text in a span to visually differentiate it.  I need to remove the span afterward though because of some quirks with the way mozillas range object works.p  pEDIT I dont want to replace the entire content of text by the way since it could be very large.  p

So by declaring the template this way p  precodetemplateltT A, T B, typename Tgt struct sum      static T const value  A  B  codepre  pthe compiler could use its capability to infer the last parameter from the informations provided by the first and the second one, and then find the best template to instantiate.p

Negative 146 pI am trying to compare two byte arrays in memory and produce a data structure to hold the differences so that with byte array B and the data structure holding the differences it is possible to recreate byte array A.p  pThe size of the byte arrays are always identical and are relatively small.  The byte arrays represent bitmaps which typically range in size from 1000x1000x32 to 128x128x32.p  pThe speed and efficiency from a cpu time pov at which the datastructurethatholdsthedifferences and the second byte array can be combinedused to reconstruct byte array A is of the highest importance.  It is not as important that the generation of the difference object be as efficient.p  pRight now my solution will be to use a binary search  md5 hashing approach to build a list of the smallest units of difference inside the image and package the raw byte data with a reference of its offset inside byte array A. p  pI.e. I generate the hash for Image As byte array and compare it to the hash of Image Bs byte array, if it doesnt match I horizontally split the image in half and hash each block then compare those hashes between the images, this process is then repeated recursively until all blocks that dont match hit a minimum size like 32x32x32 andor a max number of splits.  Once a block is marked as matching it is no longer part of the recursive search.  Once all the differences have been identified they will be added to a list of changes and that list is then the difference object.p  pAre there any built in ways to efficiently produce the results Im looking for  Or are there any libraries that would do the jobp  phrp  pstrongNotesstrongp  ul liThis is a learning project for WCF, WPF and a number of other technologies,li liIt is a VNC style system  so the images are snapshots of a window and will be sent over a LAN connection.li liThe reason the reconstructing of Byte array A must be efficient is that a client can connect to more than one server and each server can serve more than one window, so a client could be monitoringinteracting with 30 windows.li liI would like to achieve 3 fps in each window for any content that changes.li ul

Negative 146 pI have a listener bean which calls on a session beans method in the MDBs onMessage method. If an exception occurs, such as IllegalStateException which I throw or NPE, then JBoss keeps logging the exception, and also keeps retrying to deliver the same message, again spamming the logs, then it sends the message to DLQ, and again calls onMessage which again fails... madness.p  pIs there any way to stop this Is there a configuration property for an MDB which tells, if any exceptions occurs in the onMessage if onMessage doesnt return retry X times, then fricking stop trying Is therep
Negative 146 pI wonder if its a good idea letting local applications in the same server communicate with each other entirely through Restful APIp  pI know this is not an uncommon thing, cause we already have applications like CouchDB that is using HTTP REST for communication, even with local applications.p  pBut I want to take it to a higher level by creating applications that act like modules for a bigger application, which could also be a module for another application and so on. In other words, there will be a lot of local applicationsmodules that are communicating with Restful API.p  pIn this way these applicationsmodules could be in any language and they could communicate over the wire between servers.p  pBut I have some questionsp  ul liIs this a good ideali liWill the data transfer between them be slowli liIf I do this, then each applicationmodule have to be a HTTP server right So if my application uses 100 applicationsmodules then each one of these have to be a local HTTP web server each running on a different port httplocalhost81, a hrefhttplocalhost82 relnofollowhttplocalhost82a, a hrefhttplocalhost83 relnofollowhttplocalhost83a and so on rightli liAny best practicesgotchas that I should know ofli ul

Negative 146 pIm working on my first iPhone app.  My UI is composed of 4 tabs.  The first tab shows active projects.  The last tab is a settings tab where user can toggle projects onoff.  The settings tab has a NSMutableArray of projects retrieved from a webservices call and I write them out to a file in the Documents folder for the app.  The first tab reads the projects from the file by reinstating the file into a NSMutableArray and only showing the projects with an IsActive bit set to true.  Everything is working, except when I trip a projects status in the settings tab then immediately click on the first tab.  The first tab is not reflecting the changes made in the settings tab.  However, if I click on one of the other tabs before going to the first tab, then the first tab reflects the changes made in the settings tab appropriately.  The only thing I can think of is the file is not finished writing to the Documents folder when going directly from settings tab to the first tab.  Im writing the NSMutableArray in the ViewDidDisapper event for the Settings tab.  What am I missing  Thanks for your help.  p

Negative 146 pI am trying to implement a scriptutility that renames a user, sets a default password, and then will prompt the user to change their password on their initial logon in Windows Server 2003. I am able to accomplish the first 2 items but not the third.

If they hit cancel, they are taken to the initial login screen. p  pI implemented the code below to try to accomplish this. The behavior I am getting instead is that the user is given a dialog box that states that the password has expired and must changed, is prompted to do so.

Negative 146 pIm using MVC3, C, Razor. I have a view Index.cshtml that includes a reference to a Partial List.cshtml. There is also an Ajax form Ajax.BeginForm... on the page that is a filter for the list. Ive been using the default POST method for the Ajax form and everything works great. One thing doesnt work as my client expects, however. When I filter the list, then click on an item to view its details Detail.cshtml, and then click back it does not show me the filtered list but reverts to the entire list. So I would like to change my form method to a GET to fix this as well as to give me the ability to link a person directly to a filtered list. I do this but it introduces a new anomoly. I filter my list, then choose an item for detail, then click back. Now I get my filtered list as desired but I also get the query string in the URL which overrides any subsequent attempts to filter the list. Im not sure if I need to manually clear my query string or if I need to pursue a new schema altogether.

Negative 146 pIm writing a yet another generic repository of entities, which is not necessarily backed by a relational database. Id like one of the codeIEnumerableltTgt LoadltTgt...code methods to take as argument a generic codeExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgtcode predicate that specifies userdefined criteria for the entities to retrieve. Please note that I dont want to expose a full codeIQueryableltTgtcode to the user as I want to limit the exposure of the underlying storage to my users.p  pIn those cases in which the repository is backed by NHibernate 3.1, by the way, simple predicates  such as codex gt x.NameMikecode  can be pushed down to the relational database by LINQ for NHibernate using the codeWhereExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgtcode method, with obvious performance gains when the underlying set of entities is large and the predicate only selects one entity. Nice. p  pHowever, my users do not necessarily know that the repository is backed by a relational database, so the predicates can be at times so complex e.g. codex gt MyFunctionx.Name  0code that LINQ to NHibernate fails to generate HQL for them. In these cases Id like to detect LINQs failure to generate HQL and transparently failover to loading all entities and explicitly applying the predicate to each.p  pThe problem is that I cannot find a way to reliably detect that LINQ to NHibernate fails to translate the predicate expression. Executing the query straight away throws a emSystem.NotSupportedExceptionem which could be caused by anything, even by an underlying emConnectionProviderem. p  pI entertained for a moment the possibility of breaking up the query execution in two  first translate, then execute  and then catch the emSystem.NotSupportedExceptionem during translation. To this end, I tried the solution proposed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1327306doesanyoneknowhowtotranslatelinqexpressiontonhibernatehqlstatementDoes anyone know how to translate LINQ Expression to NHibernate HQL statementa in order to translate the query before execution, and I have to say that I got it to work, but it uses Reflection to access undocumented, nonpublic methods of internal NHibernate objects, and thus it smells like an unsupported hack. p  pIs there a more reliable and official way to either detect that LINQ to NHibernate fails to translate an expression, or to translate the expression without executing the queryp

Negative 146 pIve come up with a strange, unelegant workaround for this, but heres the original question...  final musings after the breakp  hr  pIts been a while since Ive posted on stackoverflow, but this has always been the best place for me to dump my programmings woes.p  pHeres my issue only the necessary infop  pI have an asp.net web app. In the web app, I have a main.aspx page. The main.aspx file consists of two main partsp  ul lipA custom UserControl for navigation which is included in the markup, ie, not dynamically loaded  emno problems hereem.pli lipA PlaceHolder control which is used to dynamically add a UserControl in the code behind, dependent on what is clicked in the navigation control.  Note that this PlaceHolder is inside an UpdatePanel...  These UserControls load fine and the state is persisted finally  emno problems hereem.pli ul  pNow  emheres the problemem...  Some of those dynamically loaded UserControls placed in the PlaceHolder mentioned above contain a CKEditor control for webbased HTML editing.  The UserControl itself loads nicely  state is persisted, embut the CKEditor control never showsem...  on creation of the UserControl I can set a watch and the CKEditor instance isnt null, but it just doesnt show up in the rendered HTML.  If I move it in or out of UpdatePanels or anywhere within that dynamicallyloaded UserControl, its a no go.  If, however, I take the CKEditor Control out of the UserControl and place it in any other nondynamicallyloaded control anywhere else in the web app, it shows up fine.p  pAfter trying some things out, it looks like this isnt just a problem with CKEditor  I tried using one of my own Navigation UserControl mentioned above instead of the CKEditor control and it has the same problem of not appearing.p  pSummary  Custom controls included in a dynamically loaded UserControl dont show up.p  pAnybody have any suggestions or wisdom to impart  Being relatively new to ASP.NET, I assume Im missing something obvious.  Let me know if youd like to see some specific code.p  hr  pIt turns out that if the first dynamic UserControl that is loaded contains a CKEditor, then it works on all subsequent dynamic UserControls that get swapped in.  If the first one loaded in doesnt have it, it doesnt pull up on the following ones  also, the IDs need to be the same across the different controls that use it. This all seems very strange to me  the workaround works fine, it just seems very unintuitive  is it something to do with the location in the pages life cycle that the CKEditor is created or some ViewState thing  Either way, its working for now and I can move on.  I remember now why I was more comfortable with nonweb developmentp

It is also having a control that displays an image with size that takes up to 70 of the dialog.p  pWhen user resizes the dialog, some of the controls in the dialog should be strongrepositioned not resizedstrong. emIt also involves resizing of the image inside the dialog.em As the resizing of image makes the whole process slow, individual repositioning of the controls are causing a visual effect of flickering.p  pI need to get rid of these.

Negative 146 pI hope someone can help me with this weird bug. Ive got a popover with buttons to perform various actions. There is a toolbar item that must be clicked to bring up the popover. Here is the action method that is calledp  precodeIBActionshowActionsidsender    ActionsPopUpController controller  [[ActionsPopUpController alloc] initWithDelegateself stateDELETEENABLED  FACEBOOKENABLED  TWITTERENABLED  EMAILENABLED]   actionsPopUp  [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewControllercontroller]   [controller release]   [actionsPopUp presentPopoverFromRectactionButton.frame inViewself.view permittedArrowDirectionsUIPopoverArrowDirectionAny animatedYES]   actionsPopUp.delegate  self  codepre  pAs you can see, I have a propertyivar actionsPopUp that retains a reference to the UIPopoverController. This is used later to call dismissPopoverAnimated when I want to dismiss the popover. Here is an example of its usep  precodevoidshareWishToEmailidsender    [actionsPopUp dismissPopoverAnimatedYES]   [[WishCloudService sharedInstance] showMailerself withItems[NSArray arrayWithObjectself.item] delegateself modalYES]  codepre  pIn this method, I dismiss the popover first, and then perform the action associated with the button that was pressed in the popover. Unfortunately, this doesnt appear to work. The action gets performed, but the popover is not dismissed. In addition, it doesnt seem to get dismissed when the user clicks once outside of the popover. But if clicked outside again, it does get dismissed. Another observation is that the first click seems to hidedismiss the drop shadow of the popover, but not the popover itself. Its the second click that dismisses the popover. However, no amount of calling dismissPopoverAnimated seems to dismiss the popover at all.p  pIve swapped in UIPopoverControllers that seem to work in other parts of the application, but get the same results, which leads me to believe that it is something specific to the UIViewUIViewController that Im presenting the popover in. I am creating the view programmatically rather than through a NIB. It escapes me at the moment why I decided to do that, but I dont believe that it should be relevant. Someone please let me know otherwise. Here is my loadView methodp  precodevoidloadView    self.view  [self createViewitem]   self.currentView  self.view   wishItemViews  [[NSMutableDictionary dictionary] retain]   [wishItemViews setObjectcurrentView forKey[NSNumber numberWithIntegercurrentIndex]]  codepre  pI have a currentView property because I need to be able to slide new views in and out, and Im using CATransition animations to do it. The currentView property is used to swap the views when it performs the transitions. Again, not sure if this is relevant, but Im including it for completeness and just in case it does make a difference. Hopefully, thats enough information for someone to help point me in the right direction. Or at least prompt some additional questions that might help me think this through. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 146 pI have a Form which covers the entire screen. I have a codetextboxcode on it which is normally hidden but appears when a user clicks, drags mouse and then leaves. After that user can enter any value in the text box. Once entered, ideally user should be able to click outside of textbox and then the normal service should resume.p  pBy normal service I mean that form should start getting all the events. What I have done so far is that on TextBoxs KeyDown event when Escape key is pressed, I have set the focus to the main form like thisp  precodethis.Focus where this is mainform. codepre  pBut this doesnt seem to work since codeTextboxcode still keeps receiving all the keys. I have a codeKeyDowncode event handler both for codeFormcode and codeTextboxcode and I have checked that all the codeKeyDowncode events pass on to the TextBox. I have a codeTextBoxcode Leave event Handler as well which never gets called.p  pThis codeTextBoxcode is the only control on the form and the main form is used for drawing shapes if that matters.p  pSo, how can I make this codeTextBoxcode lose focus when user clicks outside of it.p
Negative 146 pI am trying to set up a development environment for node.js. I assumed at first that it requires something similar to the traditional, localhost server approach. But I found myself at a loss. I managed to start a node.js hello world app from the terminal. Which doesnt looked like a big deal  having to start an app from the console isnt that hard. But, after some tweaking, I found out that the changes arent shown in the browser immediately  you need to node [appName here] it again to run.p  pSo, my question is Is there a software or a tutorial on how to create a more traditional development server on your local machine Along with port listening setup, various configurations, root directories etc things that are regular in stacks like XAMMP, BitNami or even the prepackaged Ubuntu LAMP. Since Im new at node.js, I cant really be sure Im even searching for the right things on google. p  pThanks.p

Negative 146 pIm sure Im not following correct game coding conventions here, but Im very much learning as I go.p  pReference URL a hrefhttpwww.rustyeight.comgame relnofollowhttpwww.rustyeight.comgameap  pI have a JSON feed that Im using as part of a sprite based map rendering engine. Im using JQuerys .getJSON method to pull information from a feed maps.js and fill an array with its contents. p  pIm then calling this function with a draw function.p  precodefunction drawctx     mapctx     makeManctx  codepre  pI found it strange that I didnt declare the array within the .getJSON function, all of the array items would come up as undefined when I tried to access them. So I just moved the variable call and all other processes into the function and it seemed to work fine.p  pI also have a function that draws a character data from an object.p  pThe issue Im now having is that no matter where the makeMan function call is places, the character always renders under the map. I have a feeling that this issue is based off of the fact that I couldnt access the map array outside of the json call. Im also guessing its really inefficient to have to force the context into the function every time I call a drawing function.p  pPlease refer to the link above for the code. Please let me know if you need any clarification. Im pulling my hair out herep

Negative 146 pCurrently the gdb console of Eclipse just connects the stdinstdout between the java gui and the underlying gdb process, hence many gdb shell features are missing, e.g. tabautocomplete, command history etc. p  pI want to know if there is an enhanced console for fast gdb interacting.

Negative 146 pI am interested to see if anyone has some good ideasbest practice for the folder names and structure of their image folders, plus the naming of the actual images.p  pA nonimportant question but one that has been bugging me. At the end of a build I can end up with an overflowing image folder  mostly in one giant list. I try to name my images with what I think is a form of logic e.g. locationpurposemeasurements. p  pFor a website we can split it into header, footer, article etc, but for the images different rules should surely apply. hrdlogo224x45.jpg is great in respect that I know its a logo for the header and its measurements. Semantically though the use of hdr would confuse things in the future if for some reason the client wanted it used in the footer instead or in amongst the main content. Creating a folder in the images folder called header could also confuse things. Or, following the semantic layout of a webpage, should the folder structure mirror this  header, footer, article, navigationp  pe.g.br p  pimgbr nbspnbspnbspbrandingbr  nbspnbspnbspnavigationbr  nbspnbspnbspgallerybr  nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspapplesbr  nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsporangesbr  nbspnbspnbspstructurep

Negative 146 pThis is a followup question to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8193281rebuildingapackettoinjectviapcapRebuilding a packet to inject via pcapap  pWhat I want to accomplishp  ol lipfunctionA Capture packets with pcap. Modify sourcedestination addresses. Recalculate checksums. Inject with pcap. pli lipfunctionB Create two threads. Thread 1 sends a magic packet to wake sleeping client. Thread 2 captures packets with pcap and caches the packets into an array of uchar s, since pcap puts the packet data serially into uchar  packet. When both threads terminate, I then change the headers then inject each of the cached packets.pli ol  pWhat I need help withp  ol lipfunctionA I can do everything but calculate checksums. I tried to verify the original checksum by calculating it myself with a function but they never match. However, this issue is not as important because I dont need it to demo my final project. I understand that if IP checksums are incorrect, the receiving computer will discard the packet. But when I demo, so long as my client computer can be shown to have received this incorrect packet, I have proven my overall concept and will not fail. pli lipfunctionB I guess this is the more important problem. I dont know of an easy way to cache my captured packets. What Im working on right now is as followspli ol  pfunctionB creates a pointer to an array that stores uchar  called cachedPackets. So cachedPackets basically points to an array that stores strings. p  pItll be something like this codeuchar  cachedPackets[100]code, enough array elements for 100 packets.p  pAfter this, I start two threads. Thread1 to wake my sleeping client. Thread2 to open another pcap session so no data is lost while client is waking. Thread1 is easy, Ive already tested my send magic packet function independently. Thread2 is where Im screwing up.p  pThread2 eventually calls codeint pcaplooppcapt p, int cut, pcaphandler callback, uchar usercode.p  pcallback is the function that will be run after each packet is captured. It is where I will be caching the packet into the array.p  pcallback takes parameters code uchar user,                         const struct pcappkthdr packetheader,                        const uchar packetdata codep  puser is the same string in the 4th argument of pcaploop.p  pSo I was thinking, I could sneakily give my callback function the pointer to the array of string by type casting it. p  pcodepcaploopasdf, asdf, callback, uchar cachedPacketscodep  pSince I dont know how big the incoming packets will be, Ill dynamically allocate enough space in the callback function. I will also keep track of my position in the array with a static int. p  pthis is what the callback looks likep  precodevoid cacheCalluchar  user, const struct pcappkthdr  header, const uchar  packet      static int cacheindex  0      uchar  cachethis  uchar user       uchar  cachething  cachethis     cachethis[cacheindex]  uchar  mallocheadergtlen lt 497       int i  0      fori  0 i lt headergtlen i              cachethis[cacheindex][i]  packet[i] lt503           memcpycachething[cacheindex], packet, headergtlen     cacheindex codepre  pbut when I compile, i get p  precode497 warning assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast 503 error subscripted value is neither array nor pointer codepre  pThat was pretty longwinded, hopefully my knowledge of what Im doing isnt completely misinformed.

Negative 146 pI am building a dependency injection framework and part of that process includes looping through all class files in the classpath and storing classes annotated with a specific annotation in an enumeration object. In terms of dependency injection, when a class is loaded, it finds all inject notations and then searches through all the classes that contain an injectResource notation, then returns the method values that I need to perform the DI portion.p  pMy question is, it seems a lot more reasonable to build the enumeration class list at compile time, so that when my inject fields need to search those classes I dont have to search every class in the project every single time.p  pI figure I will build the class list at compile time through the servlet config, but where can I store this global list so that I can access it repeatedly throughout the projectp  pOff the top of my head, I am thinking that at compile time I will create a static class that contains the enumeration list, but I dont prefer to use static classes and im not sure if this is the most optimal approach.p
Negative 146 pWe recently migrated to Servlet API 3.0. Since we are developing a framework which sometimes needs a few changes in the codeweb.xmlcode, projects which are based on our framework need to update their codeweb.xmlcode whenever a change in the framework is made.p  pServlet API 3.0 introduces the new emWeb Fragmentsem, which make this behaviour more loosely coupled and dynamic. I create a codewebfragment.xmlcode and move all our stuff from the web.xml in there. So the projects now have only to define the following codeweb.xmlcode and their own additional declarations.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltwebapp     version3.0    metadatacompletefalse    xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee    xmlnswebhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeewebapp30.xsd    xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee          httpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeewebapp30.xsdgt ltwebappgt codepre  pWe have to use codemetadatacompletefalsecode to enable the Fragment search in JARs our framework has the codewebfragment.xmlcode in codeMETAINFcode.p  pSince we have many dependencies to other frameworks and libraries about 8090 and the codemetadatacompletefalsecode also triggers searching for Annotations it takes up to unacceptable strong12 secondsstrong to search through all libraries.p  pThe mechanism as it is works great and I like the fact that we are more decoupled from our framework, but the startup time is fatal Also we have to increase the available memory for Tomcat from codeXms256m Xmx512mcode to codeXms512m Xmx1024mcode to get it started without getting a codejava.lang.OutOfMemoryError Java heap spacecode caused by the inefficiently implemented annotation processor of the Tomcat about 50.000 classes are cached.p  hr  pemI know that we can disable the annotation search within a library, but as we use mostly thirdparty which dont have the codemetadatacompletetruecode flag, this also isnt an option.emp  pstrongCan we do anything to disable the search for annotations Or can we force the Servlet Container to only search in declared libraries for the codewebfragment.xmlcodestrong p  pI would really like to use the new web fragment feature, but with the increased startup time and memory this isnt possible.p

Negative 146 pId asked a very similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9264588pythonthreadingormultiprocessingearliera, but the project scope is quickly growing beyond where signals can get me I think.  Basically, my program will be doing stuff on three different intervals one function every 15 seconds, one function at a configurable interval 5 to 60 seconds, generally, and one function every hour or two.p  pFrom an intuitive standpoint, it seems like multiple signal.signal calls with separate functions wouldnt get me very far an ITIMERREAL timer only issues one signal  SIGALRM, and thus there would be no way to differentiate which itimer is issuing the signal.  Since the 15second interval function emneedsem to run regardless of what might be going on with the other functions, this leaves me with the choice of multithreading or multiprocessing.p  pIm leaning towards multiprocessing, in hopes I can just spawn three child processes, each with their own signalitimer intervals, and let them each do their work at their leisure.  Is this feasible  If not, what would be the best way to have these three functions run at their desired intervalsp

Negative 146 pI often find myself taking a lot of time to navigate through my filesystem when using the linux shell.

Negative 146 pIm trying to find some kind of elegant solution for fading inout a TextView that is part of an item in a ListView. p  pTo give you some context, the listview shows a list of players in a basketball game. The user taps on a name and is provided with a dialog to log an event, for example a shot or a foul for that player. Once the dialog is dismissed the user is brought back to the listview and it is here that Id like to provide some feedback about the event that has just been logged.p  pThe way Id like to do it is to have a small string appear for about 5 seconds in the view of the item player that has just been tapped on. The small string would display something like 3rd foul or 4 turnovers. p  pA naive implementation is straightforward. Change the text of the view to the required string and then start an animation that fades in the view, keeps it there for a while and then fades it out. Problems arise however when a second event for the same player is logged shortly after the first. Ideally the first feedback string should be allowed to stay for the allotted 5 seconds and the second string should fade inout in the next 5 seconds. p  pThis queueing of animation and text changes on a perplayer bases Im not quite sure how to implement. Furthermore, Im concerned by the interaction between the animations and the Activitys life cycle. What happens or should happen to the queued animations when the activity is sent to the background, stopped or even removed from memory Or when an item is removed from the ArrayAdapter behind the listviewp  pThoughtsp  pManup

Negative 146 pI have data sets in a magnitude of 3digit GBs or even 1 or 2digit TB. The input files are therefore a list of files, each sized like 10GB. My map reduce job in hadoop processes all these files and then gives only one output file with the aggregated information.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipWhat is the appropriate file size for tuning up the hadoopmapreduce framework from Apache I hear that bigger file sizes are more preferred than the small ones. Have any ideas The only thing I know for sure is that hadoop reads blocks, each with 64MB by default. So it would be good if the file size is kind of multiplicator of 64MB.pli lipAt the moment, my application is writing the output file into only one file. The file size is then of course 3digit gigabit. I am wondering how efficiently I can partition the file. Of course I can just use some unix tools to do this job. But is it preferred to do this directly in hadooppli ol  pThx for your commentsp  pP.S.  I am not compressing the files. The file format of the input files is textcsv.p
Negative 146 pI have the following scenario in activity A, when a user clicks a button, the app sends a request to the server to retrieve some information, then this information is placed into an intent to start activity B.p  pIn activity B, in codeonCreatecode method, I do codesetContentViewR.layout.activitybcode this layout is quite complex, so even inflating it from XML takes a while, then do a bunch of initialisation.  Finally, in codeonStartcode I do some final preparationarrangements of the components.p  pIn activity A, when the user presses a button, I start an codeAsyncTaskcode, which gets the info from the server and starts activity B, passing the required info into intent.  When I call startActivity, the window of activity B slides into position straight away, however it may take a few seconds to complete the initialisation.  During these seconds, I see a black screen.  Then, finally, the codeonStartcode is executed and everything goes on.p  pWhat I would like to do is to complete all this initialisation offscreen, strongbeforestrong activity B slides into view, so that when it arrives, all the layout is already present.  Any ideas how to achieve thisp
Negative 146 pI know this must be one of the most asked things at SO, but none of the other answers gave me a solution. But from reading the other answers, looks like Ill need to redesign the way the App is working.p  pIts like this, we have a ScrollView, which will inflate some views. A ListView cant be used in this situation, because to behave the way we want it would require extending the ListView, and this is something we dont want to do even though this seems to be our only solution to our current way of showing items, because of this OOM exception. The list can have a lot of columns per row, and the bigger the screen, more columns it will have.p  pEach inflated View has a layout displaying some info from the database, including a picture. This picture is stored through a byte array. Its any picture taken with the device camera. Currently every photo byte array is taking 800kb to 1mb, which seems a lot to me. Now the list have 30 items. I took photos until the OOM happened, and it happened when I took a total of 6 photos occasionally 7. That would be 8mb9mb of data. Everytime I go to other Activity, and go back to the Activity the ScrollView is in, the list needs to be repopulated.p  pThis is the snippet of the PopulateList methodp  precodeif item.getImg  null               if App.debug                   Log.dTAG, Setting bmp.                           Bitmap bmp  App.byteArrayToBmpitem.getImg              imgV.setImageBitmapbmp          codepre  pEvery inflated View will open an Advanced Dialog, which will contain other info. Maybe the Image could be there instead on the list meaning that there would be only 1 bitmap, as every inflated View shares the same advanced dialog. Or I could extend the ListView and benefit from it recycling method Its not a good solution as I though it would be considering more than 6 items can be at the screen. Another thing that bothers me is every picture having 800kb. Seems like a lot for a 128x128.p  pThis is the setup for the sizep  precodecameraParams.setPictureSizeApp.pxToDpi128, App.pxToDpi128 cameraParams.setPictureFormatPixelFormat.JPEG  camera.setParameterscameraParams  public static int pxToDpiint px       final int scale  app.getApplicationContext.getResources.getDisplayMetrics.densityDpi      int pixels  int px  scale  160      return pixels  codepre  pSo, do you think there is a solution to my issue keeping the current model of my App, or will I need to reformulatep  pEDIT The bitmap methodp  precodepublic static Bitmap byteArrayToBmpbyte[] byteArray       Bitmap img  null      BitmapFactory.Options opts  new BitmapFactory.Options      opts.inSampleSize  2      img  BitmapFactory.decodeByteArraybyteArray, 0, byteArray.length, opts      return img  codepre

Negative 146 pSo Ive been struggling with this for a couple days now. I have a login page, that checks if the user is logging in for the first time, and if so, it shows a jqueryui Dialog box asking the user to pick their security questions. The Dialog is simple, three dropdowns, three text boxes, and a continue and cancel button. The dialog is displaying find, and when you click continue, the data is saved to the database, but it only saves the default values of the dropdownlists, and it doesnt save the text from the text boxes. It seems to me like the form is posting back before the data saves, and then saves the blankdefault content. Ive tried everything I can find on the internet to fix this. As of right now, Im launching the dialog box on page load for testing purposes.

Id like to build a viewer that allows me to browse that data, but it would be nice to be able to structure it so I can view data by device, or by PartitionKey.

Negative 146 pI have created a webservice that delivers images. It will always be oneway communication. The images will never be changed, on the side that gets them from the service.p  pIt has multiple sources, and some can be far away, on bad connections. I have created a memory cache for it, but I would like to also have a disc cache, to store images for longer periods. I am a bit unsure on the best approach to do this.p  pFirst of all, all of my sources are webservers, so I dont really know how to check the last modified date as an example of my images, which I would like to use, to see if the file has changed.p  pSecond, how do I best store my local cache Just drop the files in a folder and compare dates with the original source Or, perhaps store all the timestamps in a txt file, with all the images, to avoid checking files.  OR, maybe store them in a local SQL express DBp  pThe images, in general, are not very large. Most are around 200kb. Every now and then, however, there will be 7 mb. The big problem is, that some of the locations, where the service will be hosted, are on really bad connections, and they will need to use the same image, many times. There are no real performance requirements, I just want to make it as responsive as possible, for the locations that have a horrible connection, to our central servers.p  pI cant install any real cache systems. It has to be something I can handle in my code.p

Negative 146 pI have some data represented as multidimensional arrays. I would like to embed these data into my OO application and provide extra functionality to these data but also a way to access it both with the traditional random access and using an iterator so I could use foreach. In other words strongI would like to implement a wrapping class for a multidimensional arraystrong.p  pWhat I already triedp  pstrongI. ArrayAccessstrong The problem with this one is that the server uses PHP 5.2.17 and codeampoffsetGetcode gives an error, thus I cant return by reference, which means I cant implement multidimensional element accessp  precodeobj[key1][key2]  value codepre  pNote, that upgrading to a newer PHP version is currently not an optionp  pstrongII. Using magic methodsstrong This is a bit trickier, but my problems rose when I tried using a variable as key. E.g.p  precodeobjgtkey1[key2]  value codepre  pThe interpreter first evaluated codekey1[key2]code throwing a notice and returning the first char of key1, and uses that as key on my array. I dont know how to solve this one either. I thought of using brackets to force operation priority, but that had the same problem as in my next attemptp  pstrongIII. Using simple get and set functionsstrong Again, old PHP. It cries when I try to writep  precodeobjgtgetkey1[key2]  value codepre  pBecause it doesnt know how to index an expression ending in round brackets.p  pTheres still the lost resort option make the array public and forget OO all together. But before I go there I want to be certain that theres just really no other way of doing this.p

Negative 146 pIs there a reason for thisp  pI personally think this is actually very bad decision do not include these versions of .NET in Windows 8, because our clients now have to install it manually via Programs and components and then reboot their machines, and infact we have to provide instructions and support them. This is very uncomfortable, they will blame our software, not Windows. Why MS cannot support easy backwards compatibility even for .NETp

Negative 146 pProblem All web service calls to ServiceNows ..cmdbciwinserver.doWSDL table return zero results. p  pCause Im using PowerShells NewWebServiceProxy method, which creates a .NET .dll dynamically from the WSDL definition provided by ServiceNow. The WSDL defines 174 params of which I wish to define and query against just one, but when exercised the .dll always sends the other 173 empty params in the WHERE clause of its query, which obviously results in a nonmatch situation. p  pHopes The dynamic .dll lets me create a parameter object that contains the 174 params, and then lets me set properties as needed. Is it possible for me to create a similar object somehow only containing the single param I need Ive tried doing so with param.PSObject.TypeNames.Insert0,paramClassName, but the resulting param object was not acceptable to the wsproxy.getRecordsparam call. Also, I was not able to directly add a native property, only NoteProperties. Reverting to using the original param object, is it possible for me to remove 173 of the params The underlying object seems immutable, but maybe theres some trick Ive never seenp  pDemonstration codep  precodecred  GetCredential wsproxy  NewWebServiceProxy uri httpssnowtestcmdbciwinserver.doWSDL Credential cred   if wsproxy       Force cred onto the new wsproxy, or it will default to nonauthenticated calls     wsproxy.Credentials  cred       The parameter object well send with the query must be built from the custom object.

Negative 146 pI have two Windows 2008 R2 Standard Server on which IIS 7.5 is installed Server1 and Server2. On Server1 I have installed Web Farm Framework 2.2 and created a server Farm myFarm.com. I have also installed ARR on the Server1.p  pIn the server farm, I have added Server2 and Server1 as the secondary servers. I have configured the ARR with default option. Load balancing is configured to Round Robin so that request can go to both of the server randomly. p  pTo test my setup I have created a Test.ASPX page and deployed it in both servers.  This is a simple page which returns serverName on which server page is executed. This way I would know that load balancing is working or not. p  pThen I opened Internet Exlorer and tried to browse my Test.ASPX page from server1 which hosts Web Farm and ARR. Everytime I hit the page request goes to Server2 only. I made my server2 has unhealthy in the webfarm to check if Server1 handle the request or not. When I tried to hit the Test.aspx in the browser, I was surprised to add following errorp  pstrongThe request cannot be routed because it has reached the MaxForwards limit. The server may be selfreferencing itself in request routing topology.strongp  pFrom the error message it appears that when my server2 is not available ARR is sending the request to Server1 which is again sending it to itself causing loopback. I couldnt find a way to stop this loopback. p  pOne of the solution which I found after searching is that I should not add Server1 to the web farm as it is hosting ARR, but I have only two servers and I dont want to use one server just for ARR. p  pAs soon as I mark my server2 healthy request starts getting executed by server2. p  pCould someone suggest what should be configured to resolve this errorp  pThanksp

Negative 146 pIm trying to animate sprites along a path in Three.js using Tween.js by chaining the animations in order to have something like this p  p etcp  pEvery sprite has its own tween animation, and I just delay each tween animation at the beginning. Each sprite has in fact N animations along the path that is not a straight line and I chain them to have a loop effect.p  pEverything goes well if the FPS is perfectly stable, but my problem is that if at some point I have a FPS drop, the animations of the different sprites are not in sync anymore, and the space between sprites is not equal anymore. I potentially end up with something like this p  p etcp  pI was wondering if there is a better approach for this, like having only one tween animation for all the sprites, but I dont know how to introduce the offset between each sprite on many line segments.p  pI cannot post the exact code has it is part of a bigger app, and wont be usable as is, but it looks like this p  precode create animations for each sprite      for each segment          var currentAnimation  new TWEEN.Tweensprite.position.to             x  segment.endpoint.x,             y  segment.endpoint.y,             z  segment.endpoint.z         , animationTime.easingTWEEN.Easing.Linear.None          currentAnimation.delaydelayTime  currentSpriteNumber         previousAnimation.chaincurrentAnimation          lastAnimation.chainfirstAnimation     lastAnimation.onCompleteonEachSpriteAnimationCompleted    start the animations for each sprite      spriteFirstAnimation.start    to remove the delay when each sprite animation has made one loop,   and instantly replace the sprite at the beginning of the path   my paths are not closed var onEachSpriteAnimationCompleted  function      sprite.position.setstarting position      for each sprite animation          animation.delay0       codepre

Negative 146 pI copied a few hundred megabytes of images from my production environment into my development environment. Even though I have them in code.gitignorecode codepublicuploadscode and they are not under version control I checked with codegit lstree r master nameonlycode my last commit to GitHub was huge a few hundred megabytes.p  pI saw that the few hundred megabytes seem to be in the following directory code.gitobjectscode in subfolders named from code00code to codeffcode. I cant see the code.gitcode directory on GitHub where I commited to, but since there is the huge amount of data in it I guess it must be the reason for the commit  100 MB. Can I simply delete the subfolders under code.gitobjectscode or how can I get rid of the hunderd MBs of images that I do not want to have under version controlp

Negative 146 pIm relatively new to Symfony2, so Im learning by doing.  My controller classes are getting pretty big.  Id like to break it up with functions or objectsmethod.

It errors out, and not pretty code to boot, either inside or outside of the  . p  pI cant simply add a new NewObject.php file to the controller directory. That errors out. The error FatalErrorException ...NewObject not found.  p  pIve toyed with manual mods to ..appautoload.php but that doesnt really make sense for a simple class add to my .SRC bundle.  Perhaps I should build a .srcautoload.php file similiar to .venderautoload.php but the contents of that file dont make sense to me at all. I simply cant figure out how the AnnotationRegistry Loader works.  p  pAm I missing something  This seems way too hard.. what I want is a wrapped up include so I can use the class in dev and after deployment. p  pHow do I include NewObject.php and the accompanying newObjectfunction   in my code p  pIm told I can add a service, yet that seems like outrageous overhead for such a seemingly simple task  again, all Im trying to do is clean up my very long controller php code...p  pthanks in advance for your advice.p

I do not care about the C11 requirement though, as the code is already only Gcc4.7 compilable.p  pWould someone have a reference that would support either version Or is there some other, preferred version of how to pass data p  pI was not able to Google anything as the keywords usually led to other topics.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT NOTE The second example got refactored to incorporate suggestions from the comments, the semantics remained unchanged.p

Negative 146 pI have a strange problem and am unsure on what exactly is causing it and not sure how to fix it in a clever way.p  pI have a signalR app that sends an object, which contains a date to my client. My client is written in TypeScript, although i am not sure if this has any influence on this or not.p  pThe date in my object is a local date, not UAT.  I need to show the date this way, but when the date arrives in my client it get converted. It is almost as if the client assumes that the date is UAT and then converts it automatically to local time of the client.p  pi do not want it to be converted. i just want it displayed as it is. The one solution i can think of is to convert the date on my server side c to a string first and then send it over like that. p  pAny better ideas I dont know if it is signalR that is doing it or its some sort of std JS behavior. I am really a c developer and this confuses me completely. p
Negative 146 pIm wondering if its preferable to publish events rather than throw exceptions from aggregates. Say, I have a domain where there is a requirement that only students of a certain grade level can enroll for sports. If I call EnrollForSports on a student that does not satisfy the criteria, should the aggregate throw an exception or publish an event, particularly if other aggregates or process managers are interested in the result of the processp  pIf an event is published, doesnt it mean there would be a need for a corresponding internal event handler to handle the event when were replaying, even though the event wouldnt change the state of the aggregatep  pIf an exception is thrown, how will the other parties get notified Can the command handler catch the exception and then raise an event Can events be raised from command handlersp

Negative 146 pIt is not obvious from the implementation in codeincludelinuxkfifo.hcode and codelibkfifo.ccode whether or not there is any difference between the codekfifoincode and codekfifoputcode  OR codekfifooutcode and codekfifogetcode APIs.

Negative 146 pI have an upper triangular matrix and the result vector b. My program need to solve the linear system p  pstrongAx  bstrong p  pusing the pipeline method. And one of the constraints is that the number of process is smaller than the number of  the equations lets say it can be from 2 to numberOfEquations1.p  pI dont have the code right now, Im thinking about the pseudo code.. p  pMy Idea was that one of the processes will create the random upper triangular matrix A the vector b.  lets say this is the random matrixp  precode1  2  3   4   5   6 0  1  7   8   9   10 0  0  1   12  13  14 0  0  0   1   16  17 0  0  0   0   1   18 0  0  0   0   0   1 codepre  pand the vector b is code[10 5 8 9 10 5]code  and I have a smaller amount of processes than the number of equations lets say 2 processesp  pso what I thought is that some process will send to each process line from the matrix and  the relevant number from vector b. p  pso the last line of the matrix and the last number in vector b will be send to  process[numProcs1] here i mean to the last process process 1  than he compute the X and sends the result to process 0. p  pNow process 0 need to compute the 5 line of the matrix and here im stuck..

Negative 146 pI got 6 textboxex and an Array with them. codeltinput idslot0 typetext gtcode id from 0 to 5, also Array named codeslotarraycode. I want arrray and textboxes to be bound codeslotarray[0]code with codeinput idslot0code etc.p  pFirst i needed function that will find first empty field in array no matter if corresponding textbox is empty  but should and put there string short string  shortcode like abc or sp1. This function also need to populate bound textbox with long string. If codeslotarray[2]  abccode then  with the same number in ID here be codeidslot2code need to contain long string like Abrasive Brilliant Conexant.p  pHere what i gotp  precodelta href onclickpopulateabc,Abrasive Brilliant Conexantgt click to populate ltagt codepre  pand then functionp  precode function populateshortstring,longstring    for var i0 ilt6 i      if slotarray[i]          slotarray[i]  shortsrting       slotid  slot  i       document.getElementByIdslotid.value  longstring       break             codepre  pWith clearing at the moment of creating  codeArray,,,,,code , and textbox code.valuecode its working as it should.p  pBut then i figured out that i need function to clear textbox and bound array field. Not all but one specific for one clic. So instead of 6 functions i start to wrote p  precodelta href onclickclear0,slot0gt clear this field ltagt codepre  pfor each of textbox, with different numbers and ids ofcourse, and clearing functionp  precodefunction cleararrayid, slotid    slotarray[arrayid]     document.getElementByIdslotid.value    codepre  pBut this function do not clearing textbox neither array. I see that textbox has text, and i know that array isnt cleared because first function works finding first empty object...p  pWhat am i doing wrong here its definition of emptycleared filedtextbox maybe i need to use more complex conditions maybe it is something else. Maybe i dont need array i can manage to get rid of shortcodes and just make functions work only on textboxesp  pOk  i prepared jsfiddle demo with this, but even populating dont work.. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netBYt4911 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netBYt4911ap

Negative 146 pWhat is memoization, how it is used in python  and also how it is different from recursion.

Negative 146 pI am coding a store generator for a table top RPG. I have it set up to generate different content based on which faction you select, a random roll to determine how well the shop is doing poor, average, good, excellent, and then randomly determines the amount of an item in the shop.p  pHowever to make certain items more or less likely to show up I set it to have say 3d65 Arrows, this results in a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 13 arrows. Naturally a store cannot have 2 arrows. Is there any way to be able to still set a minimum and maximum range for a variable, but have 0 be the lowest, or make any negative value display as 0p

Negative 146 pI am reading hashing by Algorithms in C by Robert Sedwickp  pThis implementation of a hash function for string keys involves one multiplication and one addition per character in the key. If we were to replace the constant 127 by 128, the program would simply compute the remainder when the number corresponding to the 7bit ASCII representation of the key was divided by the table size, using Horners method. The prime base 127 helps us to avoid anomalies if the table size is a power of 2 or a multiple of 2.p  precodeint hashchar v, int M      int h  0, a  127       for  v  0 v         h  ah  v  M       return h      codepre  pA theoretically ideal universal hash function is one for which the chance of a collision between two distinct keys in a table of size M is precisely 1M. It is possible to prove that using a sequence of different random values, instead of a fixed arbitrary value, for the coefficient a in Program 14.1 turns modular hashing into a universal hash function. However, the cost of generating a new random number for each character in the key is likely to be prohibitive. Program 14.2 demonstrates a practical compromise We vary the coefficients by generating a simple pseudorandom sequence.p  pIn summary, to use hashing for an abstract symboltable implementation, the first step is to extend the abstract type interface to include a hash operation that maps keys into nonnegative integers less than M, the table size. The direct implementationp  pinline int hashKey v, int M    return int Mvs p  pdoes the job for floatingpoint keys between the values s and t for integer keys, we can simply return v  M. If M is not prime, the hash function might returnp  precodeint .616161  float v  M codepre  por the result of a similar integer computation such asp  precode16161  unsigned v  M. codepre  pMy question how author mean prime base 127 helpus us to avoid anomalies if the table size is power of 2 or a multiple of 2p  ol lipWhat does authorm mean by for integer keys, we can simply return v  M.pli lipWhat does author mean by If M is not prime, the hash function might returnpli ol  pint .616161  float v  Mp  por the result of a similar integer computation such asp  p16161  unsigned v  M.p  pHow author came up with .616161 and 16161p  pRequest help to understand with simple examplep

Negative 146 pIve been getting intermittent errors compiling a vertex shader, preparing for the first render of a newly created OpenGL context. Its the same vertex shader that usually works, on the same hardware. After the failure, the info log returned by codeglGetShaderInfoLogcode usually shows thisp  precodeVertex shader failed to compile with the following errors codepre  pYes, thats the whole thing. It happens on Windows, with both ATI and NVidia GPUs, though Ive mostly been testing on ATI.  If Im running under the Visual Studio debugger, an access violation may be detected in codeglCompileShadercode or in the subsequent codeglGetShaderivcode call.p  pI havent seen the bug on the Mac, but since its not always easy to reproduce it, Im not absolutely sure it doesnt happen.p  pI have noticed that if I dont call codewglShareListscode when I create my contexts, the error goes away or at least I cant reproduce it easily.  I take that to mean that some bad information is bleeding through from a previously created and perhaps previously destroyed OpenGL context to the new one.  However, Ive been trimming out stuff until there is not much that should be shared No texture objects, display lists, VBOs, PBOs. The only things left that would be shared, as far as I know, would be shader and program objects.p  pAfter creating an OpenGL context for a window, I initialize shading roughly like thisp  precode Program initialization GLint vertexShader  glCreateShader GLVERTEXSHADER  glShaderSource vertexShader, 1, ampvertexShaderSource, NULL  glCompileShader vertexShader  GLint   status glGetShaderiv vertexShader, GLCOMPILESTATUS, ampstatus  if status  GLTRUE      GLint fragmentShader  glCreateShader GLFRAGMENTSHADER      glShaderSource fragmentShader, 1, ampfragShaderSource, NULL      glCompileShader fragmentShader      glGetShaderiv vertexShader, GLCOMPILESTATUS, ampstatus      if status  GLTRUE              GLint program  glCreateProgram         if program  0                      glAttachShader program, vertexShader              glAttachShader program, fragmentShader              glLinkProgram program              glDetachShader program, fragmentShader              glDetachShader program, vertexShader              glDeleteShader fragmentShader               check for link success...                else      char logBuf[1024]     glGetShaderInfoLog vertexShader, sizeoflogBuf, NULL, GLcharlogBuf      LogToFile charlogBuf   codepre  pThen I render multiple frames, and at some point clean upp  precodeglDeleteProgram program  glDeleteShader vertexShader  codepre  pand destroy the OpenGL context.  Later, I create a new OpenGL context in the same window, initialize it in the same way, but the vertex shader fails to compile.p  pIf I dont render any geometry, I cant get the bug to reproduce, but rendering a single point suffices.p  pIt still happens with a simplified vertex shaderp  precodeversion 120 void main      glPosition  ftransform     glFrontColor  glColor     glBackColor  glColor  codepre  pand a simplified fragment shaderp  precodeversion 120 void main      glFragColor  glColor  codepre  pI tried AMDs CodeXL OpenGL debugger, setting it to break on errors.  It just tells me that the compile is failing, which I already knew.p  pThe OpenGL context that fails is on a window where a different context was previously created, successfully rendered, and destroyed.  Theres nothing wrong with reusing a window like that, is there  I am aware that once youve called codeSetPixelFormatcode, you cant change the pixel format of the window.  I made sure that Im using the same pixel format each time.p  pADDED  While trimming down the rendering code, I found that if I commented out the linep  precodeglEnable GLVERTEXPROGRAMTWOSIDE  codepre  pthen the error went away.  But with more realworld rendering e.g., textures reinstated, it doesnt seem to make a difference.p  pADDED 372014  I finally made a selfcontained Visual C project that can reproduce the bug under certain circumstances, so that any interested parties can try it  a hrefhttpwww.frameforge3d.comnewsmacShaderBugTest.zipShaderBugTest projecta  To make the error reproducible, you need to have Microsofts Application Verifier set to watch for Heap errors.  An enclosed Read Me has more detailed steps to reproduce.p

As many as entries i give, it stores in the xml. But when i go to ReadActivity its supposed to show the arrayList size in textViewtxtv, but it isnt. Again when i nevigate back to the mainActitivy than it doesnt store the previous values any more , just keeps the recent values from EditTextBoxes. Any idea, where i am doing it wrongp

Negative 146 pSome warnings appear in terminal during runningp  blockquote   pOpenCV Error Assertion faileds0 in setSize, file homemeopencv2.4modulescoresrcmatrix.cpp, line 116p blockquote  pThe program compiled without error and able to execute, the problem is the eye ROI size changes when user moves closerfarther away from webcam, due to the changing of size, the warning appears. I managed to solve this warnings by setting the eye ROI size equal to my eye template size. However, it ends up the program fails to classify users eyes openclose because the minVal obtained is 0. The method used is OpenCV a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsimgprochistogramstemplatematchingtemplatematching.html relnofollowTemplate Matchinga. Alternatively, I fix my distance from webcam and fix the eye template size could avoid the warning. Every time warning appears, the program fails to classify openclose eyes. The program doesnt work effectively because sometimes it mistakenly classifies the open eyes as close and vice versa.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  ol lipIs there any alternative to identify open and close eyes other than template matchingpli lipAny ideas how to improve the program in classification of blinkingpli lipAny working example that you know in opencv CC API can classify open and close eyes and count accurately the blinking timesp  precode         static CvMemStorage storage  0             Create a new Haar classifier            static CvHaarClassifierCascade cascade  0             Function prototype for detecting and drawing an object from an image            bool detectanddraw IplImage image ,CvHaarClassifierCascade cascade             const char cascadename[1]eyes.xml            cvMat roiImg            int thresholdvalue  200            int thresholdtype  3            int const maxvalue  255            int const maxtype  4            int const maxBINARYvalue  255            int houghthr  35            cvMat srcgray, dst            using namespace cv            Mat img1 Mat img2 Mat templ Mat result            const char imagewindow  Source Image            const char resultwindow  Result window            int matchmethod0            int maxTrackbar  5            int eyeopen0            int eyeclose0             Matching with 2 images ,eye closed or open            void MatchingMethodcvMat templ,int id                           Source image to display             cvMat imgdisplay             roiImg.copyTo imgdisplay               Create the result matrix             int resultcols  roiImg.cols  templ.cols  1             int resultrows  roiImg.rows  templ.rows  1             result.create resultcols, resultrows, CV32FC1               Do the Matching and Normalize             cvmatchTemplate roiImg, templ, result, matchmethod              cvnormalize result, result, 0, 1, NORMMINMAX, 1, Mat               Localizing the best match with minMaxLoc             double minVal double maxVal Point minLoc Point maxLoc             cvPoint matchLoc             cvminMaxLoc result, ampminVal, ampmaxVal, ampminLoc, ampmaxLoc, Mat              Justing checkin the match template value reaching the threashold             ifid  0 ampamp minVal lt 0                                  eyeopeneyeopen1                 ifeyeopen  1                                            stdcoutltltEye Openltltstdendl                      eyeopen0                      eyeclose0                                                     else ifid  1 ampamp minVal lt 0                 eyecloseeyeclose1                 ifeyeclose  1                                            stdcoutltltEye Closedltltstdendl                      eyeclose0                      systempython sendarduino.py                                    For SQDIFF and SQDIFFNORMED, the best matches are lower values.

Negative 146 pI have installed better exposed form module on my Drupal 7 site, I created a view for commerce module catalog, and made a slider range filter on JQuery, here it is sorry, the site is in russian language, but anyway, the essential thing is a JQueryUI slider a hrefhttpdoors.ekt0.ru relnofollowhttpdoors.ekt0.rua. So, the question is, how to set the slider minimum and maximum possible values programatically from a hook. This is because a want to make the min and max prices be real, from the database table with product prices. Here is my codep  precodefunction zenformviewsexposedformalterampform, formstate     minmax  dbquerySELECT MINcommercepriceamount AS min, MAXcommercepriceamount AS max FROM fielddatacommercepricegtfetchAssoc    form[commercepriceamount][min][value]  minmax[min]   form[commercepriceamount][max][value]  minmax[max]  codepre  pand heres the contents of commercepriceamount key of form arrayp  precode[commercepriceamount] gt Array        [tree] gt 1       [min] gt Array             [type] gt textfield            [title] gt             [size] gt 30            [defaultvalue] gt               [max] gt Array             [type] gt textfield            [title] gt And            [size] gt 30            [defaultvalue] gt          codepre  pSo, as we see here, the only array key that looks like what I need is defaultvalue, but its not actually the one, it doesnt make any visible changes to the form, and I also tried value key as on the code, but it sets default slider range values, just moving the knobs, not making minimum and maximum values. So the question is, how to do it, and the second question is that perhaps, there is any setting in the module to set that min and max values automatically I coudnt manage to find anything in the settings. Thanks in advancep

Negative 146 pI am looking for a good approach for implementing intranet Web Application using Web Api2 with Asp.net MVC5. Application is designed in such a way that we use AngularJS SPA at client side and in server side MVC with Web Api as a single applicationweb site. MVC is because we have to  restrict the operations based on the security permissions. We dont render the action buttonseg. Save, Delete etc when we call MVC controller for views if the user does not have permission. Other operations are utilizing Web API methods to Save, Delete etc,p  pBasic idea is p  pMVC Controllers are for generating views with action buttons removed if the user doesnt have permissionhtml templates for AngularJS. Data Manipulation is through Web APIAngularJS http service web api callsp  pQuestions herep  pHow do we derive an authentication mechanism which we can utilize for both MVC and Web API We can create Authentication filters but we have to create separate filters for MVC and Web API, rightp  pOnce the user is authenticated how do we share this info with both MVC Controller and Web Api controller instead of validating the user each request from angular jsp  pIs it possible to use ASP.Net forms authentication for both MVC and WebApi for authentication. If so how do we do that. Will forms authetication token validates for both MVC controller and Web Api controllers automatically using [authorize] attributep  pAlso I would like to know, is it a good approach mixing MVC with WebApi with in a single application p

Negative 146 pIve been playing around with the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiForwardbackwardalgorithm relnofollowforwardbackward algorithma to find the most efficient determined by a cost function dependent on how a current state differs from the next state path to go from State 1 to State N. In the picture below, a short version of the problem can be seen with just 3 States and 2 Nodes per State. I do forwardbackward algorithm on that and find the best path like normal. The red bits in the pictures are the paths checked during forward propagation bit in the code.p  pNow the interesting bit, I now want to find the best 3State Length path as before but now only Nodes in the first State are known. The other 4 are now freefloating and can be considered to be in any State State 2 or State 3.

In this case, I want find a 25State length path with minimum cost.p  pAddendum Someone pointed out a better algorithm would be Viterbis algorithm. So here is a problem with more variables thrown in. Can you guys explain how would that be implemented Same rules apply, the path should start from one of the Nodes in State 1 Node a or Node b. Also, the cost function using the norm doesnt make sense in this case since we only have one property Size of node but in the actual problem Im expecting a lot more properties.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comm4Sk3.jpg altA better picture of the problem.p

I could also go through the elements in this sorted list and while the key value is the same, append it into a new bucket, but I am looking for something more STL like in nature, and right now the above smells like a bit of a last resort hack, also the final solution needs to be efficient as the testVec is potentially large and the objects are also big in size.  I would prefer not to modify the testvec  so it should be immutable.p  pIdeally I am looking for some sort of construct that spits out range iterators or something equally efficient.  The actual objects are large so passing references or moving them is really the only option  my actual objects the equivalent to MyStr are movable.  Something sort of foreach key, apply key predicate or something which I cannot figure out is what I am looking for.  I hard coded the 3 buckets below just to show what I need to be able to attain  this is totally a hack.p  pThanks in advance for any help with this problemp  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt include ltsstreamgt include ltiteratorgt include ltvectorgt include ltalgorithmgt  struct MyStr      int key     stdstring strval      MyStrint key, const stdstringamp rStrVal           keykey         , strvalrStrVal             let stream operators be friend functions instead of members     inline friend stdostreamamp operator ltlt stdostreamamp os, const MyStramp val          os ltlt key[ ltlt val.key ltlt ], strval[ ltlt val.strval ltlt ]         return os           bool operator lt const MyStramp str const          return key gt str.key        int main      stdvector ltMyStrgt testVec           MyStr4, key 4,          MyStr3, key 3,          MyStr3, key 3,          MyStr2, key 2,          MyStr2, key 2,          MyStr2, key 2           auto comparator  []const MyStramp lhs, const MyStramp rhs          return lhs.key lt rhs.key           stdvector ltMyStrgt foursBucket     stdvector ltMyStrgt threesBucket     stdvector ltMyStrgt twosBucket      auto ostriter  stdostreamiteratorltMyStrgtstdcout, ,     stdforeachtestVec.begin, testVec.end,          [amp]const MyStramp next             switch next.key              case 4                 foursBucket.pushbacknext                 break             case 3                 threesBucket.pushbacknext                 break             case 2                 twosBucket.pushbacknext                 break                           stdcout ltlt Elements with Key Value 2 ltlt stdendl     stdcopytwosBucket.begin, twosBucket.end, ostriter     stdcout ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Elements with Key Value 3 ltlt stdendl     stdcopythreesBucket.begin, threesBucket.end, ostriter     stdcout ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Elements with Key Value 4 ltlt stdendl     stdcopyfoursBucket.begin, foursBucket.end, ostriter     stdcout ltlt stdendl  codepre  pproduces the following outputp  precodeElements with Key Value 2 key[2], strval[key 2],key[2], strval[key 2],key[2], strval[key 2], Elements with Key Value 3 key[3], strval[key 3],key[3], strval[key 3], Elements with Key Value 4 key[4], strval[key 4], codepre  pAs you can see the structure is very simple and Ive shown how I can currently sort the objects using a predicate but I do not know which of the plethora of algorithms to choose from to efficiently iterate over p

Negative 146 pRight now I have an autocomplete directive with two types of inputs a general and a more specific category e.g. states vs cities, categories of business retail vs lines of business retail banking etc.  I have a window that presents cartouchesbuttons with all the added elements that are only of the latter, more specific kind which can then be individually removed.

Negative 146 pI am using the java API with the Tango Peanut phone, and I wanted to know if there is a way to get the raw IR image from the RGBIR camera that the depth sensor uses.  I know that a quarter of the pixels from the RGBIR camera is IR data.  I also know that all of the 4MP RGBIR image gets put into the superframe and then converted to YUV. However it was unclear on how to decode the IR channel, or if it is even possible at this point.  If its lost inside the YUV superframe, is there any other way I can retrieve the raw IR imagep

Negative 146 pMain question How do I combine different randomForests in python and scikitlearnp  pI am currently using the randomForest package in R to generate randomforest objects using elastic map reduce. This is to address a classification problem.p  pSince my input data is too large to fit in memory on one machine, I sample the data into smaller data sets and generate random forest object which contains a smaller set of trees. I then combine the different trees together using a modified combine function to create a new random forest object. This random forest object contains the feature importance and final set of trees. This does not include the oob errors or votes of the trees.p  pWhile this works well in R, I want to do the same thing in Python using scikitlearn. I can create different random forest objects, but I dont have any way to combine them together to form a new object. Can anyone point me to a function that can combine the forests Is this possible using scikitlearnp  pHere is the link to a question on how to this process in Ra hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19170130combiningrandomforestsbuiltwithdifferenttrainingsetsinrCombining random forests built with different training sets in Ra .p  pEdit The resulting random forest object should contain the trees that can be used for prediction and also the feature importance. p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 146 pWhat I mean by forkable iterator  it is a regular iterator with method codeforkcode which creates a new iterator which iterates from the current point of iteration of original iterator. And even if the original iterator was iterated further, fork will stay at the point where it was forked, until it itself will not be iterated over.p  pMy practical use case I have a socket connection, and some packets that sent through it. Connection can be shared between receivers and each packet can be addressed to some receiver. Packets can come in unordered way, so each receiver can potentially receive packet for different recevier. And more than that  if one receiver received packet for different recevier, this different receiver must still be able to read that packet.   p  pSo for that I want to implement such forkable iterator, which will represent the connection, and each receiver will make own fork, read it and search for packets addressed for it.p  pDoes somebody know any implementations of what Im talking aboutp

See code below.p  precodedef main    f  openusrlocaldocFEguide.txt, r    full  list    companies list    for line in f       line  line.split,       full.appendline[1] codepre  pA line from the opened file is in this format. The 1 slice is in order to omit the useless first element in the text line, not shown belowp  pNow I need to make it so that the user can enter the search term of an Automaker or Type ie. Standard SUV. My hunch is that I need to make a list of just automakers which could be done with some kind of slice and then a list of all the types and then have this call the entire line if true. Im having trouble actually implementing that. p
Negative 146 pIve just come across this program that deals with multidimensional arrays. While Ive got the gyst of it, theres a particular notation that Im not sure of.p  pThe idea is to pass a pointer to the column of a multidimensional array, because 2Dim arrays do not require you to mention the number of rows in the 2D matrix.

Negative 146 pSo I know there is a codeUITableViewcode, but it does not show up in the codeUIStoryboardcode and neither does it in the simulator.

Negative 146 pI am using two functions sprintf and snprintf for dealing with conversions of double to string, In one of the case, the application which is running has a different locale than the Windows locale. So, in such a scenario locale which is considered by sprintf is always of the application. Whereas, snprintf sometimes starts using Windows locale. As a consequence of this, decimal characters returned by both the methods are different and it causes a problem.p  pTo provide further details,  I have a library in my project which builds a string from double, this library uses snprintf to convert a double to string. Then I need to send this information to server which would understand . dot only as a decimal symbol. Hence, I need to replace the local decimal character with a . dot. To find out the local decimal character in order to replace it, I am using one of the libraries provided in my project which uses sprintf. Then I replace this character with a dot to get the final output.p  pAlso, please note, sprintf is always considering locale of native application while snprintf sometimes considers locale of Windows. As the problem is inconsistent, sorry for not providing a clear example.p  pSo, what are the circumstances under which snprintf might behave differently Why am I getting such different behavior from these two methods How can I avoid itp  pP.S.  I have to use these 2 methods, so please suggest a solution which would not require me to use any different methods.p  pThanks.p

Negative 146 pMy apps on Heroku use a DATABASEURL. This is simple to parse with Java into a JDBC URL with a user name and password. Theres no issue there. However, I have a JOOQ generator and Flyway migrator that have maven plugins and I cant figure out how to get the JDBC URL, User Name, and Password that these plugins require into maven. So currently I do it on app startup which is not ideal. When my app starts I get the DATABASEURL, parse it, then do the flyway migration and jOOQ code generation. But I would like this to happen during the actual build process, not during application startup.p  pBasically I need the Heroku Environment variable formatted like postgresuserpassec2host1234pathtodb to be accessible in maven as a property like this jdbcpostgresqlec2host1234useruseramppasswordpass.p  pI think the solution may lie with the maven build helper plugin but I cant get the regex properties specification quite right.p  pThanksp

In other words, to completely cover the interval AG, one HAS to go through F.  Therefore, my minimum spanning tree probably should only connect AF, not AG.  Is there a standard way, given a larger graph, to find all of the subgraphs whose intervals contain no unique patches  In other words, since all paths have to pass through F to get to G, AF is the min spanning path of interest, not AG.  How does one reduce a graph in such a way without inspecting it manuallypli lipBecasue I have to go from AG, I would never go backwards or take a cyclic path.  For example, Id never go ABA.  Do spanning trees incorporate this  And does this make my graph directed  Consider point C from C one could go to D, E, or F, but never back to A for our use case.

Negative 146 pNgmodel and iOS credit card scanningp  pI have a credit card form.  Each field looks something like thisp  precodeltinput typetext ngmodel  cc.number, ngclass  validClasscc.numbergt codepre  pThe codevalidClasscode function returns codevalidcode or codeinvalidcode, and it used for asyoutype validation.  It all works great if you type a credit card thats too long, or doesnt pass Luhn validation, it lights up red.p  pWhen you hit submit, the code does credit card stuff with the values of codecc.numbercode, codecc.securityCodecode, codecc.monthcode, and codecc.yearcode.p  pThe problem comes when you use iOSs a hrefhttpwww.cnet.comhowtoscanyourcreditcardinsteadofkeyinginnumberforpurchasesinios8 relnofollowcredit card scannera.  Its a feature that, when you click on a credit card field on a website, lets you use your phones camera to scan your credit card.  It then parses that photo and puts the credit card number  expiration date into the form.  Its pretty cool.p  pHowever, when iOS safari does this, it doesnt seem to trigger ngmodel to update.  The codevalidClasscode function output doesnt change based on the new input.  Worse yet, when the user submits the form, the updated value of codeccnumbercode doesnt appear to have changed.p  pIts frustratingly hard to debug this issue since this scanning feature isnt available on the iOS simulator.  Its also not available on a real iPhone when I point it to a local network address e.g., my laptop.  It emappearsem to only show up as an option on https sites, which makes it really hard to debug.p  pTLDR iOS Safaris scan credit card feature doesnt update ngmodel variables.  Does anyone have a good way to fix or work around thisp

The formulas listed on the wikipedia page easily spit out values a large amount above 256.p  pFor example, a longitude of 87.7494 radians, when plugged into the formula for the Xaxis, produces 3703.23219542.  This value is way above 256.p  pTry it yourself 128  pi  2  0  87.7494  pip

Both versions where build inside the same solution VB.net, VS 2010 using the same code. Both versions would be deployed using the VS setup project. Everything worked fine.p  pNow I added a new project for ACAD 2014. After building the setup and executing it on the development machine A, it installed everything correctly and the plugin worked in ACAD 2011 and 2014. The same setup executed on a different machine B seem to install everything perfectly. But the plugin is not executed inside ACAD. Not even the formerly working 2011 version.p  pI checked the installation itself, the files exists, all registry entries are correct. I can see, that the DLL is loaded into the acad.exe process. But no code is executed, no commands are available.p  pAnd now the strange thing After I build the setup on machine B, the setup worked like a charm and I was able to use both setup versions on both machiness A and B.  But the setup is not working on a different machine Cp  pIt seems, that during the creation of the setup something happended to machine B Some configuration change which is responsible for successfull execution of the pluginp  pWhat are possible reasons for such a behaviour How do I get this plugins executedp  pI tried to keep this as short as possible.

Negative 146 pI have a DataGrid whose ItemsSource is a ListCollectionView.  We are using grouping and grouping on an Enum property.  This works fine.  This issue is that the Enums are in an arbitrary order, so that the groups show up as unsorted.p  pWe resolved this by setting the CustomSort property to an IComparer implementation which sorts the enum in the correct order.  This works as well.  The groups are now sorted correctly.p  pWhat does not work is when the user clicks a column header to sort.  Within a group the sort is correct, but it causes to groups to get unsorted.  The IComparer provided to CustomSort is never called.  My question is how can I keep the groups sorted and allow the user to sort within the groups by clicking on the column headersp

Negative 146 pI am interested in using standard alarm PIR sensors to control the Nest autoaway functionality.p  pThere is a similar question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25617480nestapiquerycontrolofsystemfromintruderalarmNest API Query  Control of system from Intruder Alarmap  p1 If you manually set the status to home from autoaway, will the nest then reevaluate the autoaway status in a short while  I.e. If you set it to home whenever the PIR is triggered, will it behave as if you just walked infront of the Nest p  p2 In the Nest developer documentation it states the following a hrefhttpsdeveloper.nest.comdocumentationcloudawayguide relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.nest.comdocumentationcloudawayguideap  blockquote   blockquote     pHome and Away are set via user interaction in the Nest app or on the Nest Thermostat. Clients that set Home or Away must prompt and require a user confirmation for each HomeAway transition.p   blockquote      pThe Nest API provides the ability to directly set Home and Away, as well as listen for changes to these states. When setting HomeAway, it should be done as the Nest app does it as the result of an explicit user request. Trying to algorithmically set this state runs the risk of creating a confusing user experience and is forbidden by our UI amp Marketing Guidelines.p blockquote  pThis suggests that using external PIR sensors to remove the autoaway status is forbidden as the user has not explicitly requested the change. Is there a better way to do this or is the text in the Nest developer documentation just overcautious  The responses in the other question were talking about changing it based on the alarm being armed and disarmed which are explicit user inputs rather than just being changed by walking infront of the PIR sensors.p  pThanks, Andrew.p

He is so Im moving forward and checking if hes got 95 left for transfer. He doesnt so the transaction is rolled back. The problem is, in the end they both have 100. Why For method codepaycode I set codePropagation.REQUIRESNEWcode, which means it executes in a separate transaction. So why is it also rolled back The tax payment should be actually save into a database and only the transfer should be rolled back. The whole point of doing this for me is understanding propagations. I understand them teoretically but cant manage to do some real example of itHow propagation change affects my project. If this example is misunderstanding Id love to see another one.p
Negative 146 pI am using the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.Application interface I can get Outlook events to record OK ifp  pa Outlook is already running when my application starts,p  pb If Outlook started once my application is running.

I have done some checks, and at the time of the Quit event  the NewExplorer event is still assigned. But then obviously becomes unassigned before the next outlook open. Ive tried assigning it when the user clicks on the Outlook app button so just before it opens and this doesnt produce any runtime error, but this does not solve the problem.p  pSo currently if a user starts using Outlook, then shuts it and then restarts, only events from the first Outlook session will be recorded.p  pThe OutlookEventListener class that I am using is pasted below.

Unfortunately, either its not possible or just dont know how to do it. p  pBut lets leave the strongPassstrong , Ive created some column in ma source data, that do the trick. What i want the most is percentage amount of people whom pass the test in certain month  in other words, 200 done the test, 100 pass it and, obvious, 50 is the result what I want to get OR  strongPassPeople 100strong. p  pThats all. Sorry for the amount of text. I forgot to mention, i need it to create pivot chart and will use it many times. Thats why dont want to do it manually. Thanks for any thoughts, help and ideas. Cheers.p

It continues to receive messages with notification payload until deletetokenWithAuthorizedEntity is called. If i understand this correclty, when my app stops, it should call disconnect so it will recieve push notifications alerts and badgesp  pAny help is appreciated p

Negative 146 pI am converting an app to use Core Data from previously just being inmemory objects. This app fetches data from a remote API and, previously, created objects in memory with an incrementing ID and I figured out which direction the user was navigating turning pages in based on whether this incrementing ID was getting larger or smaller. And based on that populated child view controllers being given to the PageViewController with the correct info. The object selection logic was in the codedidFinishAnimatingcode pageViewController delegate method because it was only called once per page transition.p  pNow Im storing some objects in Core Data and I need to know what is next and previous in order to properly set the next and previous view controllers being fed to the PageViewControllers. As before Im fetching from a remote API but now creating Core Data managed objects based on the data retrieved from the API.p  pI could make my own incrementing counter field in Core Data but I wondered if there is a better way to do this I dont want to use Core Data like a RDBMS. p  pMore generally  how are people using Core Data to power PageViewController apps with a dynamic object collection with potentially no last pagep  pNote This project is written in Swift.p

Negative 146 pFirst off, I am primarily a back end developer.p  pBuilding a site with 2 navs. Main nav with something like home ect and a sub nav with about us, contact us ect..p  pThe nav changes enough between the bootstrap XS view and the regular view that it needs 2 completely different menus code wise. I want to keep them in sync so if someone clicks on a sub nav in xs and then resizes to xs, the correct nav is still highlighted. Or vise versa. p  pIe the home nav has 4 sub navs in xs, but in xs it turns into a drop down menu and has 6 sub navs. So some custom logic will be needed either way. p  pMy thought was to use the hash in the url to keep track of what navsubnav is current. When the nav in xs is expanded, read the hash url and change what is highlightedexpanded. Since clicking anywhere will collapse any sub nav drop down, I dont see any way other than to expandhighlight what is current when expanding the sub nav.p  pSo simply, what is the best way to handle this I am used to using backbone for my spa sites and I dont think it can handle this, I can also think of many ways to do this through just JS, or maybe angular has a good way to deal with it. p  pBuilt many spa sites with backbone as I normally just need the navigation so angular seems like a bit of overkill, but Ive never dealt with angular in depth and maybe it will do better at handling this. p  pAny ideassuggestions would be greatly appreciated. Hope it all makes sense. p  pI know its a lot, but thanx ahead of time.
