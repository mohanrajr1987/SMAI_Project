Positive 6554 pI have a very strange issue. I am trying to use the Wand ImageMagick binding for Python to convert a PDF to a PNG.

Positive 6554 pI wrote this function in PHP for changing a picture from one color to another, and I really like it.

Negative 6554 pI have two tables.  Widgets, which has information about each widget Color, size, etc each widget has a unique ID, WidgetID.br  The other table is Tests, and it contains information about multiple tests that were run on each widget. This table, therefore, has multiple rows for each WidgetID. It contains information that we can call WidgetID, Date, Param1, Param2, etc test information.br  I have written a query that finds, for each WidgetID, the most recent two tests by date.  The SQL looks like this  p  pSELECT Widgets.WidgetID, Widgets.Color, Widgets.Size, T.Date, T.Param1, T.Param2,br  FROM Tests AS T INNER JOIN Widgets ON T.WidgetIDWidgets.WidgetIDbr  WHERE Select COUNT FROM Testsbr  WHERE WidgetID  T.WidgetID AND Date  T.Date lt 2 p  pThis works very well. However, it gives me too many widgets.  I have created a query that filters the widgets called WidgetFilter.  It basically just chooses the ones i want based on whatever i choose.  The idea was that I would run the same query replacing Widgets in the code above with WidgetFilter.  However, when I do this it takes forever.  In fact, it just freezes.  I left it for an hour and a half and it just sat there and i had to alt ctl delete.  My only thought is that it is querying the WidgetFilter query for every row of Tests and thats a lot of rows.  I also tried applying the filter criteria within the original query.  I get the same result.  p  pIs there a better way to do this  Either a single query that does it all and possibly doesnt even look like this or what i was thinking is that there should be a way to run the WidgetFilter query once and make that data look to access like a table isnt there such a thing as a temp table.  That way it doesnt run WidgetFilter for every item in Tests.p  pEDITbr  WidgetFilter is actually pretty complex.  I have created these GUI pick tables where the user sees two columns.  The choices on the left and the list heshe is creating on the right and in the middle there is an add button and a delete button.  They then call the report which executes WidgetFilter, yadda yadda yadda.  Anyway, when the user adds an item, it adds that item to a table.  So for the Widget category, Color, there will be a table called ColorList.  The user constructs this list through the gui.  There are three of these guis Color, Size, Type.  For each of them there is a table and there is then a Global boolean eg, ColorFlag that tells which filter to use Color, Size, or Type.br  So, in the WidgetFilter query, the criteria box under Color will have thisbr  InSelect Color From ColorListbr  and there is an expression column Expr1 getColorFlag  which is a module that returns the value of the Global variable ColorFlag.  and it is true at the same time the color table is applied.  So, when all is said and done there are three rows of criteria.  The code looks like this  p  pSelect Widgets.WidgetID, Widgets.Color, Widgets.Size, Widgets.Typebr  From Widgetsbr  WHERE  getColorFlag  True AND Widgets.Color InSelect Color FROM ColorListbr     OR  getSizeFlag   True AND Widgets.Size  InSelect Size  FROM SizeListbr     OR  getTypeFlag   True AND Widgets.Type  InSelect Type  FROM TypeList  p

Ive been programming for a long time now but Ive really just gone in and decided in rather random fashion. p  pAre there any design patterns or books that deal with this A related question would be if we should only set parameters in an object using getter and setter methods.

Negative 6554 pCurrently Im working on a CC crossplatform clientserver software. Im very experienced developer when it comes to low level socket development. The problem with Berkley socketsWinsock, is that you always have to make some kind of parser to get things right on the receiver side. I mean, you have to interpret data, and concatenate packets in order to transmit correctly. packets often get sliced p  pHave in mind that the communication is going to be bidirectional. Is pure socket the best way to transmit data nowadays Would you recommend SOAP, Webservices or another kind of encapsulation to this application p

Negative 6554 pDevelopment environment is C 3.5 with a SQL Server 2008 database and Entity Framework.p  pImagine you have a class and a table called Sign which represents a physical electronic sign created by a third party which your software needs to control. You also have a class called SignDriver which takes care of actually communicating with the signs. The propertiescolumns of Sign represent configurable information needed by the Sign Driver to properly talk to the signs.p  pEverything is great and youve patted yourself on the back quite thoroughly. Then the need arises to talk to a different sign. However this sign works differently to the previous one and requires your Sign class and table to store additional information. Lets say 5 new things columnsproperties need to be stored, but, unfortunately the first type of sign does not need these 5 things. You then find when you want to control 10 of each type of sign, you have many NULL values in your table.p  pYour domain model grows until you have more classes like Sign, each representing a different part of your problem domain and each with a corresponding table in your database. Each class suffers the same issue of collecting the common information of its type well, but NOT catering for the specialisations of each type well at all.p  pYou realise that the nature of your problem means that there are going to be more types of signs to control, as well as more types of your other entities to cater for. You need a more extensible model.p  pWhat would be the best way forward for a system like thisp  pI have discussed this at length with my collegues and would really like to know what the best way to approach a problem like this is. Especially because it seems like a problem MANY people would have faced in the past.p  pBelow are the options weve come up with and some points about eachp  ul liCreate emnem number of type classes and table for each entity to share a 1 to 1 relationship with. ul liVery inheritancey.li liMost time consuming when extending.li liMany tables.li ulli liCreate one extended properties table for each entity to hold keyvalue pairs. ul liReferential integrity.li liExtensible.li ulli liCreate one global extended properties table to store properties for ANY entity. schema entityType, entityId, key, value, dataType ul liSuper extensible.li liCannot have referential integrity with existing tables.li liDoesnt look like Entity Framework will be able to handle this well.li ulli ul  pWhat would you do and whyp  pAny help greatly appreciated.

Negative 6554 pIm porting an application from iPhone to Android. The iPhone app has artwork for some dozen or more buttons in their normal and pressed state. That translated over just fine to Android. However, we of course currently dont have any images for the focused state.p  pBesides the work involved in creating all these focused button images, were not sure exactly what color to set the focus too. Selection color varies from phone to phone, etc. Wed have to come up with some neutral white glow of some sort I suppose.

Im testing my gitignore filters as I go by running git status.p  pHowever, I have a larger number of untracked other files in a emdifferentem subdirectory, so git status shows all of those too, which makes it very hard to see what the .gitignore rules are doing.p  pIf the files were tracked, then I could just do git status . and it would restrict the gitstatus output to only those files in the current directory, but because the current directory and all its contents are untracked, git status . returns error pathspec . did not match any files known to git.p  pIm using git1.6.6.1 for this, although interestingly my testing shows that git1.7.1 on a different system does actually let you do gitstatus on an untracked directory. Unfortunately I cant upgrade git on this system. Is there a known workaround for 1.6.6.1p

Negative 6554 pI asked myself this question a couple of times and came up with a solution for that feels very dirty. Maybe you can give me any advice since I think this is a basic problem for every DSL written in Scala.p  pI want to have a hierarchical structure of nested objects without adding any extra syntax. Specs is a good example for thisp  precodeMySpec extends Specification    system should      example0 in  ...      example1 in  ...      example2 in  ...        system can      example0 in  ...      codepre  pFor instance I do not have to write codeexample0 in  ...   example1 in  ...   example2 in  ...   Nilcode.p  pThis is exactly the same behaviour I would like to have. I think this is achieved by an implicit definition in the Specification class in Specs like please do not be offended if you are the Specs author and I missunderstood something p  precodeimplicit def sus2specsus Sus Specification     suslist  sus   this  codepre  pMy main problem arises now when I want to nest such objects. Imagine I have this grammarp  precoderoot statement  statement     IDENT  statement     declaration     declaration IDENT  INT codepre  pI would like to translate this into a DSL that looks like thisp  precodeMyRoot extends Root    statement0 is      nestedstatement0 is        nestednestedstatement0 is          declaration0  0               declaration1  1       declaration2  2           declaration3  3       statement1 is      declaration4  4     codepre  pThe problem that arises here is for me that the implicit solution does not work. The implicit definition would be executed in the scope of the root object which means I would add all objects to the root and the hierarchy is lost.p  pThen I thought I can use something like a Stack[Statement]. I could push an object to it for every call to codeiscode but that feels very dirty.p  pTo put the question in one sentence How do I create a recursive DSL wich respect to its hierarchy without adding any extra syntax and is there a solution to do this with immutable objects onlyp

Negative 6554 pI have a program that was written on XP.  What Ive found out is that it doesnt work properly on Win7 because HLKM is no longer writable by nonadmins.p  pEssentially, when you register the program, the licensing information is supposed to go into the registry. That information is valid for everyone on the computer, not just the one user, so I dont want to put it in HKCU.  But any copy of the program needs to be able to edit that registry even if its a nonadmin running it, because there are certain situations when its going to go get updated license information from my web server for example, if the registry data is lost or damaged, or if your current license is expired and it needs to see if weve applied an extension.p  pIts not horrible if it goes out to the web server for every unique user who starts up the program, but it causes some annoying issues, so Id rather it continue to work the way it did in XP.  Is there a way to store data in the registry and still have it shared under Win7, or am I going to have to start looking at storing an INI file on the drivep

The way Im referencing the path in the code is justp  precodeXmlDocument xDoc  new XmlDocument xDoc.LoadsettingsOpened.xml codepre  pWith the file being in the same folder as the .exe. I dont want to hard code the full path in for the XML files either.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Rossp

I would like to mimic that in the project but cant. After organizing my sources it says that some cant be found when I compile.

I have also tried to use the Add New Filter it has a folder icon and it does indeed create a folder in the project but they arent physical folders. They are just there to help organize the files in the Solution Explorer for the project.p  pIve tried Google searchingp  pcreate folder visual studio 2010 project add folder visual studio 2010 project create file structure visual studio 2010 projectp  pAnd they just direct me to drag over the folders from my Solution Explorer and again they dont actually add the folders.

Negative 6554 pSuposse I coded a C library which provides a bunch of public functions, declared in a codemylib.hcode header file. Those functions are supposedly implemented in say a codemylib.ccode file which is compiled to a say static lib codemylib.c gt mylib.o gt mylib.acode.p  pIs there some way to detect that I forgot to provide the implementation of some declared function in codemylib.hcode Yes, I know about unit testing, good practices, etc  and, yes, I understand the meaning of a plain function declaration in C.p  pSuppose codemylib.hcode declares a codevoid func1code and this function was not coded in the provided library. This will trigger an error only  if the linker needs to use that function. Otherwise, it will compile ok and even without warnings  AFAIK. Is there a way perhaps compiler dependent to trigger a warning for declared but not implemented functions, or there is any other way to deal with this issuep  pBTW a hrefhttpunixhelp.ed.ac.ukCGImancginm relnofollownm ua lists not all undefined declared functions, but only those used by the library, i.e., those functions that will trigger an error in the linking phase if not declared somewhere. Which makes sense, the library object file does not know about header files, of course.p

Negative 6554 pIn my WPF application  I have a Listview with a Gridview inside. A user is able to add files to this list.p  pThe gridview should allow me to have quite rich rows, each row showing file name, extra application detail and most importantly a progress bar. Each row in the gridview is databound to a business object in a collection, and specifically the object has a property Progress which is bound to the progress bar.p  pI need to process each file, extract data and send the data to a web service and I would like to display the progress for each file in its respective progress bar as I work through the collection of files.p  pInitially I started off with a simple loop containing the processing logic which periodically updated the Progress field for each row and noted that the UI didnt update very well.p  pI then moved the processing logic in the loop to a BackgroundWorker which modified the business object Progress field, and because the UI thread was not working so hard  it was a lot more responsive. p  pHowever due to the asynchronous nature of BackgroundWorker, it started multiple BackgroundWorkers one for each row virtually all at once as the loop spun out. All my progress bars started progressing...p  pWhat would be the best approach to limit it to only 23 BackgroundWorkers going at once Or even leave it at one BackgroundWorker  and it doesnt start until the previous one is completed How can I introduce a dependency so that in essence all the BackgroundWorkers are  synchronousp

Negative 6554 pOne thing Ive seen in some Desktop applications is the ability to change the color of text as the background changes  to effectively have multiple colors on a single character. Ive seen this most commonly with progress bars that display the percentage inside the bar. Generally a darker background color will be used as the progress bar color, and as it progresses, the dark color doesnt contrast enough with the dark text, so the text color changes as soon as the bar overlaps with the text. This image should explain what I meanp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1gvMm.gif altProgress Barsp  pAs you can see, the text is black when its at 0  when there is no dark background. When the background image fully progresses to 100, the text is completely white. But in the middle, as you can see at 50, the text is half blackhalf white, and its actually split on the 0 character in this example.p  pIs there any way to do this at all on a webpage CSS, Images, Jquery, otherwise Preferably not Flash or a Java applet though  Im really wondering whether an HTMLbased solution is possible.

Negative 6554 pI am using Core Data for the first time. I created an entity called Channel. The tutorial I was using also created a Model File for each entity. So it is like an object class called Channel which declares the attributes as ivars, and then retains them with property. Now in the .m file, instead of synthesizing them, dynamic iVars was used. Now obviously, since I am retaining and not releasing, the code leaks. I tried writing a dealloc method, but it does not work. It says Use of undeclared identifier ivar name.p  pWhat is the problem here Is creating a Model File even necessary when using Core Data If so, why is that And how would I release those variablesp  pThanks,p

Negative 6554 pIve needed own triangle shape so, I inherited my triangle class form TShape and override paint method. Everything works fine, but I need to move this shapes with mouse. I set the method for every shape handling onMouseDown event. Moving work also fine. But If two shapes overlaps shapes are in fact rectangles with some transparent areas, that the tops shape transparent area is over another shape, then the top shape moves instead of the shape below. Its correct, that is how delphi works. But its not intuitive for the user.

Negative 6554 pI am developing a big application and i have to load test it. It is a EC2 based cluster with one HighCPU Ex.Large instance for application which runs PHP  NGinx.p  pThis applicaton is responsible for reading data from a redis server which holds some 5k  10k key values, it then makes the response and logs the data into a mongoDB server and replies back to client.p  pWhenever i send a request to the app server, it does all its computations in about 20  25 ms which is awesome.p  pI am now trying to do some load testing and i run a php based app on my laptop to send requests to server. Many thousands of them quickly over 20  30 seconds. During this load period, whenever i open the app URL in the browser, it replies back with the execution time of around 25  35 ms which is again cool. So i am sure that redis and mongo are not causing bottlenecks. But it is taking about 25 seconds to get the response back during load.p  pThe high CPU ex. large instance has 8 GB RAM and 8 cores. p  pAlso, during the load test, the top command shows about 4  6 phpcgi processes consuming some 15  20 of CPU. p  pI have 50 worker processes on nginx and 1024 worker connections.p  pWhat could be the issue causing the bottleneck p  pIF this doesnt work out, i am seriously considering moving out to a whole java application with an embedded webserver and an embedded cache.p  pUPDATE  increased PHPFCGICHILDREN to 8 and it halfed the response time during loadp

Negative 6554 phere is the situationp  pI have written a C program doing some wireless measurements on a WRT54GL Router OpenWRT White Russian, Busybox 1.00, Dropbear client v0.49. Please note that i can not use a more up to date version of the operating system on the router or install additional packages just scripts or small programs are allowed. p  pUp to now, i log my measurements results every 15 minutes from the router to the server via abr codecat localfile  ssh targetaddress cat gt remotefilecodep  pwhich i call from my C program system for every logfile which is created or present at the moment the log starts. What i dont like is, that the system call opens a new shell for every single call, causing some overhead. The good thing is that in this way the data is encrypted and because i do a connection for every file, i can directly get per file feedback from the server, so that i can remove the logs from the router. Other approaches calling scripts from the router on the server, which then return values for the logging did not work, as the dropbear ssh client does not support this return.p  pSo what im asking for what could be a more elegant way to do so and to reduce this overhead  By now, ive read a few tutorials about how to use TLS  TCP Sockets so i can send the data encrypted to the server. Another possibility could be a HTTP PUT or POST, but there i am not sure how i could get feedback for the data being send. So i would just like to hear your oppions and how you guys would try to tackle this.p  pBest regardsp

Negative 6554 pI have a design problem.  I have an application which subscribes to a realtime system to show data.  essentially what happens is the client connects to a server, downloads a snapshot of the data at the current time, and subscribes for live updates, which are immediately displayed on the UI.p  pOne problem we have is that we can open multiple realtime reports which means that we have multiple connections and duplications of data which are not necessary.  So we want to make a central data repository to hold all of the data and serve it to the reports, so that we only use 1 socket connection and one set of data crosses the wire.p  pThe problem I have is this.  When a report subscribes to my data repository, it retrieves the snapshot at the present time, and then receives live updates afterward.  That means my repository is updating its internal cache with the live updates from the server, and sending those updates to subscribed reports.p  pwhen another report connects to the repository, it needs to also download the current data and subscribe to updates.  However, if updates come in while the snapshot is being downloaded, they will be missed by the report.  I also cant lock the cache while the snapshot is being downloaded, because that would cause report 1 to stop updating while report 2 gets its snapshot.p  phow can i ensure that report 1 continues to get its updates, while report 2 downloads an unmolested snapshot and then begins to receive all the updates that it missed in the meantime as well as future updatesp  pSorry if this isnt clear.  I am not always good at describing my problem   The data that comes in is essentially rows in a table which i then summarize into a tree.  they can be identified by key fields in the row, and my cache would store the latest copies of each rowp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 6554 pI am developing a Wordpress site locally on my computer. I have two installations of Wordpress, one is inside strongCxampphtdocswordpressstrong and the other one is in strongCMySitesmedicalprojectwordpressstrongp  pI have XAMPP installed and I access the first installation by typing stronglocalhostwordpressstrong. For the second I had created a virtual host named strongmedicalprojectstrong and to access that I simply opened my browser and typed strongmedicalprojectstrong.p  pAll was going well until I tried to create another host for testing purposes. I saw that it wasnt working so I deleted the new virtual host and was left with the emmedicalprojectem one only. But the problem is not solved. What happens is that the browsers FF, IE, Chrome, Opera do not recognize emmedicalprojectem and run a google search instead. Apache starts normally and I can access both emlocalhostem and emlocalhostwordpressem which is the first installation.p  pI mention that when I was trying to add the second virtual host Avira Free Antivirus blocked access to the hosts file where you have to add the loopback IP for local hosts 127.0.0.1 and the name of the server. I disabled that feature, restarted several times and tried but no luck.p  pBelow is how my httpdvhosts.conf looks like. I mention that this exact configuration was working before.p  precode Virtual Hosts   If you want to maintain multiple domainshostnames on your  machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations  use only namebased virtual hosts so the server doesnt need to worry about  IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.   Please see the documentation at   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2vhostsgt  for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.   You may use the command line option S to verify your virtual host  configuration.    Use namebased virtual hosting.  NameVirtualHost 80    VirtualHost example  Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.  The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not  match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any ltVirtualHostgt block.  ltVirtualHost 80gt     ServerAdmin postmasterdummyhost.localhost     DocumentRoot Cxampphtdocsdummyhost.localhost     ServerName dummyhost.localhost     ServerAlias www.dummyhost.localhost     ErrorLog logsdummyhost.localhosterror.log     CustomLog logsdummyhost.localhostaccess.log combined ltVirtualHostgt  ltVirtualHost 80gt     ServerAdmin postmasterdummyhost2.localhost     DocumentRoot Cxampphtdocsdummyhost2.localhost     ServerName dummyhost2.localhost     ServerAlias www.dummyhost2.localhost     ErrorLog logsdummyhost2.localhosterror.log     CustomLog logsdummyhost2.localhostaccess.log combined ltVirtualHostgt  ltVirtualHost 80gt     DocumentRoot Cxampphtdocs     Servername localhost ltVirtualHostgt  ltVirtualHost 80gt     DocumentRoot CMySitesmedicalprojectwordpress     ServerName medicalproject     ErrorLog CMySitesmedicalprojectmedicalproject.error.log     CustomLog CMySitesmedicalprojectmedicalproject.access.log combined   ltDirectory CMySitesmedicalprojectwordpressgt     Order allow,deny     Allow from all   ltDirectorygt ltVirtualHostgt codepre

Plus, it still restarts the app occasionally once enough changes are made.li liI can exclude the codebehind file from the web application project, change the codebehind attribute in the aspx page declaration to an src attribute, then edit the code from there while the app runs until i make enough changes to trigger a restart.

Negative 6554 pAll, p  pI manage to connect with MQ Websphere version 6 from C using two DLLs from IBMp  precodeamqmdnet.dll assembly version 1.0.0.3 amqmdxcs.dll assembly version 6.0.0.0 codepre  pThe above assemblies are deployed locally with my application.p  pHowever if try in a server that already has MQ Websphere version 7 installed in the GAC then I have a big issue. p  pBasically the above two DLLs are in the GAC but they are very different from the ones I have as they are for version 7. However the assembly version is the same.  Hence my application fails because it picks the version 7 assemblies as they have the same assembly version and same public key token. p  pOne solution is obviously removing the version 7 DLLs from the GAC.  Is there any other optionp  pThanks MKp

Negative 6554 pIve been wondering about the security aspect of my application. Im using CodeIgniter PHP Framework for my project.p  pId like to know some expert opinions on this. I have a login function. When a user logged in, the session is store in database. I added information like user Id in the information session. A user can create a company. But to do that, I first check his account to see if he already has one.  This session user Id allows me to run a DB request to find that out. For example p  precodefunction create     hasCompany  thisgtAccountmodelgthasCompanythisgtsessiongtuserdataid     ifhasCompany         data[company]  thisgtCompanymodelgtgetCompanyInfothisgtsessiongtuserdataid         thisgtloadgtviewcompanypanel, data          else         thisgtloadgtviewcompanycreate        codepre  pAnd then if he has one, I can print the company editdelete panel. It allows me to avoid the use of id parameters in the url like  myserver.comcompanyedit[id]p  pSo to get to the point, I was wondering if, in term of security, this is ok or there is some kind of vulnerability.p  pAny advices are welcome p

If I look into the raw post request, I can see that the post data is urlencoded which is I guess a different type of encoding than htmlentities does. Does that mean that client must perform some recoding before sending the request. Does client browser store input values in encoded form or decoded form in memory before sending I already know that php automatically decodes urlencoded data in requests so that part is fairly clear to me.p

Negative 6554 pConsider a solution has 2 projects ProjectA and ProjectB both are MonoTouch apps and ProjectBase. ProjectBase contains the whole application, but Main.cs file with the entry point is located in ProjectA and ProjectB which reference ProjectBase.

Negative 6554 pIm creating a language learning website and in one section Id like to have many pages each with a table of verb conjugations.

The question is, is there be a more efficient way of doing this  In particular, if there is a register with results from SSE or AVX comparisons on floats which put code0xffffcode or code0x0000code in that slot, how can the results of all the comparisons be for example anded or ored together, in general  Is codePMOVMSKBcode or the corresponding codemmmovemaskcode intrinsic the standard way to do thisp  pAlso, how can AVX 256bit registers be used instead of SSE in the code abovep  pstrongEDITstrong p  pTested and benchmarked a version using VPTEST from mmtest intrinsic as suggested below.  p  precodem128 x  x1, x2, x3, 0 m128 a[N]  packed a1[i], a2[i], a3[i], 0 m128 b[N]  packed b1[i], b2[i], b3[i], 0 m128i refmask  mmsetepi320xffff, 0xffff, 0xffff, 0x0000  for int i  0 i lt N i      m128 gtmask  mmcmpgtpsx, a[i]     m128 ltmask  mmcmpltpsx, b[i]     m128 mask  mmandpsgtmask, ltmask     if mmtestcsi128mmcastpssi128mask, refmask               do stuff with i       codepre  pThis also works, and is fast.  Benchmarking this Intel i72630QM, Windows 7, cygwin 1.7, cygwin gcc 4.5.3 or mingw x8664 gcc 4.5.3, N8 shows this to be identical speed to the code above within less than 0.1 on 64bit.  Either version of the inner loop runs in about 6.8 clocks average on data which is all in cache and for which the comparison returns always false.p  pInterestingly, on 32bit, the mmtest version runs about 10 slower.  It turns out that the compiler spills the masks after loop unrolling and has to reread them back this is probably unnecessary and can be avoided in handcoded assembly.p  pWhich method to choose  It seems that there is no compelling reason to prefer codeVPTESTcode over codeVMOVMSKPScode.  Actually, there is a slight reason to prefer codeVMOVMSKPScode, namely it frees up a xmm register which would otherwise be taken up by the mask.  p

However, is there a way that I can, in a centralised manner, first email the innerException message to myself along with the stack trace, and then show the message to the userp  pIn other words, I dont want to create a method like EmailException and call it in every catchException ex block but Id like to call it once somewhere where all exceptions are first caught.p  pIf my question is not clear enough please tell me.p  pThanks againp

Negative 6554 pIm about to start working on a project for an organization using C. In order to get the necessary data I have to get the data from a database, however, I will not be given access to the database even to create the application. As you can assume this creates a bit of a challenge.p  pIn a past project I created a PHP script that accessed a database for me and returned the data in JSON format. Id like to the same, unfortunately there are around 100120 queries that I would need to be able to make so it would be very time consuming to create a PHP script for every query that I need.p  pIs it possible to create a method in PHP that takes in a string argument and then use somehow pass the string into it from C If so then how can I do it If I can pass a string to the method within the script then it would only take 3 methods in the PHP script in order to make all the necessary queries.p

Negative 6554 pIm completely new to rails and have a bit of a question about some decimal values from my database showing up as being slightly off by a very small amount in the default scaffolding indexshow outputs in the browser. I have an item where the specific value of an attribute is 9.12, which I can confirm is stored in my sqlite3 database correctly as a decimal. However on the index page, or the show page for the item, its giving me 9.119999999999999p  pJust to be even more confusing, if I attempt to edit the item the form will show the precise value of 9.12 in the relevant field.p  pBy playing around a bit I can see that other values for instance 9.11, 9.13, 9.14, 9.123 will give me similar precision errors in the html output, while many others e.g. 9.1, 9.09, 9.15, 9.121 will display as they should.p  pNow I realize that this kind of behaviour is expected when using float values because of the way theyre stored in binary, but my understanding was that a decimal shouldnt have any such quirks to do with precision. If thats true then all I can assume is that the issue lies with Rails. So can anyone enlighten me on what causes this behaviourp  pObviously I can update my view so as to make it display properly like so  p  precodelt numberwithprecisionitem.value, precision 2 gt codepre  pbut considering that each item I seeded in the db has a plethora of decimal values that all display just fine, I dont want to have to do this for every decimal value when the issue seems to be the exception rather than the rule.p  pIm using Rails 4.0.0beta1 with Ruby 2.0.0 by the way in order to follow along with the latest edition of the Agile Web Development with Rails book.

Negative 6554 pI have a piece of code that Resharper tells me has unused variables, but the variables are definitely used.  The variables are used in a Databind and the fields to bind are specified as strings.  Since the field names are accessed using the string variable, Resharper doesnt think they are being used.brbr In the following code sample Resharper tells me to change the public variable to private.  After doing that it tells me that the variable is unused and can be removed.  Both of these suggestions are wrong as the variable is used and must be public.brbr I dont like that Resharper warns me about this and is yellow.  I would like to check in my code green.  I know I can ignore this using the option to suppress with a comment but in the past I have never stronghadstrong to use this option and was able to find other solutions to get my code green.

Negative 6554 pIve asked this question before on here but no one showed me how to actually make google charts appear via the codeload functioncode.I use google charts API and the charts display fine on a normal page .. However , when I am calling the page containing the charts code through the Jquery load function , nothing shows , but the same exact code shows on other pages .. I am required to use the load function for this , because as soon as you click on an image to compare two people , the charts have to appear from the page theyre created loaded through Jquery.p

Negative 6554 pI have a three part form that works like this, the first form is called createticket.php and its basically a form with a customers contact info and what they want done. When the ticket is filled out it gets submitted to MySQL then when a search is done of the db you can select the ticket you want by clicking on the select link associated with that ticket in the search result and the browser will open a new window with the 2nd part of the form but it will pass the id associated with that MySQL record in the browser so you see at the end of the url id10 now the 2nd part of the form is what a technician will use to fill out what they did and when they click get signature on the bottom of the page it will pop up the 3rd part of the form which allows the customer to sign on the techs ipad or Toughbook and when they click accept it should update that record in MySQL associated with that id passed in the url. My issue is its not working. so you can view the form at a hrefhttpjemtechnv.comtestticketresults.php relnofollowhttpjemtechnv.comtestticketresults.phpa and see when you click on select it brings you to the technicians form to be filled out.

Negative 6554 pI am encountering a strange issue which is only affecting several users from an over 7000 userbase. Having searched the web for several hours to no avail, Im hoping someone here can helpp  pI have an ASP.NET 2.0 website and when certain users try to access the home page Default.aspx they receive a white screen with no content loaded. This issue is occurring both in production environment and if I run the solution against a copy of production data. So I am able to replicate the exact same issue when I pseudo the problematic users.p  pWhen debugging the application in VS2005 and set a breakpoint in the code behind in the Default.aspx, the breakpoints are firedhit so I know the request is working. The problem seems to be once the server has finished serving the request, the response back to the clientbrowser is empty.p  pHeres another strange thing Ive noticed. If I alter the HTML in Default.aspx by adding a new white line or whitespace, the page will load fine for the same set of users. I thought I had resolved the issue with this fix but unfortunately the white screen issue just manifests itself once again.p  pWithin Default.aspx, theres some AJAX requests using jQuery .load function but this cant be the issue because this functionality exists for every user of the site. The only variable is the amount of content returned within this request can vary depending on the user. But why would it resolve itself when I put a whitespace or whiteline in the page and then manifest itself hours laterp  pAnother thing to note is its only Default.aspx that is encountering this issue. If I browse to another page by typing in a page in the address bar, the page is served OK.p  pHope someone can point me in the right direction on how I can debug or even resolve the issue.p

Negative 6554 pI have a couple of questions concerning the way Eclipse 4.3 and JBoss EAP 6.1 work together.p  pThe first would be concerning the Server clean function.  Does it matter if the server is running or not when that function is selected within Eclipse  I have tried both ways and get no indication one way or the other that it has preformed the task.p  pThe other question concerns the hot deploy. Im just starting a project so I have errors in my  files, mostly the configuration files.  Everything complies clean.  When Eclipse deploys my war file it does so with something like 0.0.1SNAPSHOT.war.  Its always the same name so I cant tell if mu updates have been deployed.  p  pThe way Im currently processing my deploys is to 1. Undeploy the war file from within the Server Admin page 2. Do a Maven clean 3. Do a project clean 4. Do a war build 5. Redeploy from within the Server Admin page.p  pSo this question would be how to determine if my current changes have been deployed  Is there a better way of doing it than the way I currently doing itp  pThanks for the support.p

Negative 6554 pId like to change the name of a parameter in my preferences file. The new version of my app expects the new name. If an older version is already installed, it will have created a preferences file that will contain the old parameter name. After updating, the newest version will not be able to find the new name. Therefore I need to change that name.p  pOne obvious solution is for the new version to check the parameter name in the preferences file and change it if necessary. That could be done for example in the codeonCreatecode method. But I would prefer to avoid the burden of doing that check every time the app is started. It would be better if it could be done just once, when the app is updated.p  pSo what I want is to do the cleanup of the preferences as part of the update process. Is it possible to run some Java code as part of the installation Can the update process do something other than copy the new app files on the old ones If not, is there any other way to do such changes to the preferences file on update Note that, although I want to change the emnameem of a parameter in the preferences file, I need to keep its emvalueem.p

Negative 6554 pI want to embed screensharing into my web app.  p  pThe idea would be that one user would broadcast their screen via a screensharing software ideally this would also be via the web and others could subscribe to this channel.p  pScreen Hero requires that everyone download their software, which is not ideal.  Google Hangouts API is too restrictive for my purposes.  I want this all to happen inside an iframe or flashHTML5 element in my website and I dont believe that that is feasible.  Id also prefer it if my users did nt have to connect with the G accounts.p  pAre there any known, cheap or free options  Any noncheap optionsp  pAm I misinformed about the Google Hangouts or Plus API, such that I can easily embedp  pThanksp

Negative 6554 pI recently updated to Xcode5, only to find myself in a totally unfamiliar environment. A lot of the important things I had gotten used in the previous year works differently or just simp[ly dont work at all, starting with the way how I initiate my root viewController in the appDelegate. It used to be something like thisp  precodeself.window  [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]]  self.viewController  [[ViewController alloc] init] self.window.rootViewController  self.viewController [self.window makeKeyAndVisible] codepre  pWith Xcode5 and iOS7, however, this has changed, and I cannot even do the most simplest things. There is simply nothing in the AppDelegate now. p  pI know it is a very broad question and Sketch Overflow does not like these types of questions, but can someone point me toward a tutorial, or documentation that lists the most important changes in the new Xcode and how to overcome them I did a search on the Apple Developer website but found nothing. I know it is probably there I am just not finding it.p  pSorry for the vague, amateurish question p

What is the mistake in my code.p  h1Q2h1  pIf I cancel the popup and again click on Test Connection it would never work.  The handler still maintains some kind of reference or state of previous popup instance.  As it could not be found, it throws undefine on object members.  I confirmed this as through the debugger, I could see the id of previous popup instance instead of the current one.  The handler always tries to honor the first popup instantiated no matter what.p  h1Q3h1  pIs the pattern we are trying to follow for this sample prototype is having any pitfallsproblems.  We are trying to develop using MVC features of ExtJS and ensure that we are using stand and good patternspractices so that we will not be facing above kind of very basic issues.p

Im using access just to look at the data and get a general idea of everythingp  pThere are a few tables that will not import due to precision errors.p  pIm just starting out with this database type so Im fairly new to all this. Although I do have past AS400 DB2 experience back in the day. The dictionary files remind me of that a bit.p  pAnyways the problem is a with a field with amounts in it. It works fine unless the amount is greater then 999.99 then I get an error about the field being too small. Apparently ODBC is assuming the field is precision of 5 with 2 decimal places. I looked at the dictionary file and  as far as I can tell the field is set to 10R  with a conversion code of MR2 which seems like it should be adequate.p  pWhere do I set this in Universe so that ODBC knows it is larger then that.p  pThanks for any help.p  pUpdate I was looking at wrong field the output format of the field I need in the dictionary is actually 7R. If that makes any difference.p

Negative 6554 pI am trying to connect my classic ASP website to the MySQL database. I am using the followingp  precode1. OS Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit 2. DB MySQL 5.6.14 64 bit 3. ODBC Driver MySQL ODBC 5.2 ANSI Driver 4. IIS IIS 8 codepre  pHere is what I have done till now.p  pI have downloaded the MySQL 5.6.14 64 bit database from MySQL website and installed it successfully. The database is working perfectly as I am able to create tables, stored procedures etc.p  pNext I created a folder miradev inside the wwwroot folder and wrote 3 classic asp pages. The first one is the login.asp page, the second one is the checklogin.asp page and the last one being the index.asp page.p  pNow I am able to see It works in my browser. p  pI next created a System DSN in the ODBC Data Source Administrator 64bit. I named it as MySQL 64 Bit, TCPIP Server as 127.0.0.1, Port as 3306, then username as root and password as root. I tested the connection and it says Connection successful.p  pThe connection string that I am using isp  precodestrconnect  DriverMySQL ODBC 5.2 ANSI DriverServerlocalhost Port4040DatabasemiradevUserrootPasswordrootOption4 codepre  pI next typed in the path to my login page on my browser and the login page came up alright.p  pI typed in the username and password as expected and hit Enter. The expected result is, after I hit enter it should authenticate me via the invisible page checklogin and then if it matches with the database, it should pass me to index.asp.p  pNow here is the catch. If I do this in ChromeFirefox, it takes me to index.asp but instead of showing the correct contents it displays the error message An error occurred on the server when processing the URL. Please contact the system administrator. If you are the system administrator please click here to find out more about this error. The click here takes me to a page which tells me how to configure classic asp with mysql. I have done all that and I think I am on the correct path but missing something very silly. p  pBut if I do the same steps in IE 11, then it stops me at checklogin.asp and tells me there is a server error. I am sure the logic in checklogin for authentication is fine as it works in my other computer but I am not sure what I am missing.p  pIt would be of great help if you guys help me out. Thanks a lot in advance p

Negative 6554 pI am using Mifare Ultralight C to make a access control system.  The method I am using is based on the UID of the card.

controller and its added controllers work just fine in other Windows, but on this specific kind of Window it gets buggy.p  pstrongEND EDIT 2strongp  pThe problem Im having in Android is that the touch events on the views contained on the rows are blocked for some reason, I have known about the performance issues on Android when dealing with TableViews and after testing in several devices, that unless the element that has the touch event has finished rendering the user will be allowed to interact with the views with touch events. This is only a guess but I think is somehow accurate to my problem. Another problem I experience is the images contained in the table rows sometimes disappear while scrolling or interacting with other elements of the table.p  pI switched from using ScrollView mainly because the methods for adding elements to a table view are way more practical than the ones found in ScrollView i.e. the ability to insert rows at an specified position and such behaviour not found in ScrollView. I tried List View but the implementation in Alloy is so confusing and the documentation isnt clear on how to change the contents dynamically using other Alloy views.p  pIs there a way to workaround these issues How can I make the images to stop disappearing How can I bypass this touch blockp

Negative 6554 pI am currently developing two forms which are pretty similar in functionality, although one form is to be used on a PC and the other form is tailored to be used on a lowresolution scanner device.p  pI want to share as much logic as possible, thats why I am using MVP Passive View for this.p  pBut the scanner version has some slight differences to it, for example to dynamically show and hide some controls. This is of course somthing I want to put in my Presenter as well so I can unit test it.p  pSo my question is should I put this logic in the same presenter Or should I make a variation of this presenter by inheriting from it Or should I simply make everything separate, dedicated to the specific form, although my View and Model are exactly the same for both formsp

Negative 6554 pMaybe this isnt the best way to do this, but now that Ive gone down the rabbit hole, I want to know how it works. Im trying to use d3 to create a tree where the nodes will settle downwards, much like there is gravity. Im hoping that this, along with the charge that each node has and the tension in the rope will make it so that it will end up looking as I imagine, with it balancing itself out. Im trying to simulate this constant downward acceleration in d3, but Im a beginner at d3, and dont know exactly how. Im also running into the problem that the simulation stops running, and d3.timerforce.resume doesnt help.p  pSo essentially, I want to have a root node fixed at a certain position like a pivot, with child nodes coming off of it and gravity, charges, and tension being present so that the children settle automatically and balance themselves into a tree structure.p

Negative 6554 pI have been pulling my hairs for the past few days. It appears I am the first one who has experienced this problem because I could not find anything that is even close through Internet searches. The problem that I have experienced is the followingp  pIcon for retina iPad of iOS 6.1 and prior size 144x144 and Icon for iPhone of iOS 7 size 120x120 are not installed correctly. If I use asset catalog, when installing my app on iPad retina with iOS 5, the iPhone icon 120x120 is installed. iPhone with iOS 7 works fine using the same icon 120x120. If I dont use asset catalog, but instead add the icons to the info.plist CFBundleIcons array, it goes the other way around. iPad icon is fine this time 144x144 icon was installed. But iPhone uses the iPad icon 144x144. p  pWhats more strange is that this is not a problem with one of my two targets. It is only a problem for the second target. The second target was created by duplicating the first one. I have compared the info and settings of the two projects, but did not see any difference other than bundle identifiers and product names etc., of course.p  pIve upgraded my Xcode to 5.0.2 and that makes no difference.p  pId appreciate it if anybody could shed some light on this.p  pUpdate 1 I tried to use the icons from the first target and the problem is still there. So its not related the icon png files. Its target related. Also tried to clean the project, delete the app from the devices to no avail.p  pUpdate 2 When I use plist instead of asset catalog, whats incorrectly installed on my iPhone iOS 7 is not the 144x144 icon. It is 144x144 icon for iOS 6.1 and prior. Its still an incorrect icon. p  pUpdate 3 This is actually easy to reproduce. I created a cocos2d project from scratch this time the Hello World project. Tried to add all the icons using the two ways introduced in the following technical article from Applep  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1686index.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1686index.htmlap  pWhen using the asset catalog, 120x120 icon was installed on my iPad retina with iOS 5. When using the project editor, 152x152 icon was installed on my iPad retina with iOS 5. p  pIn both cases, what is supposed to be installed is the 144x144 icon. Will probably contact Apple on Monday.p

On the contrary when I rightclick and install, I do not see it in Programs and Features.p  pIve followed this link to create the setup project.

Negative 6554 pI have a custom made listview control that shows a list of notifications to the user.  Basically, when a new notification comes in, a new entry is added to the listview in Bold.  When the user reads the notification, it turns to regular font.p  pThe only way I could work out how to achieve this probably a read status was to use checkboxes.  So a new notification would have its item checked and when it was read it was unchecked.  This works well and seems to achieve what I need.p  pHowever, my question is....is there a way I can remove the drawing of the checkboxes but still keep the functionality in the background.  So for example, not draw the checkbox for the listview item, but still be able to use ListView.Checkboxes  True and ListViewItem.Checked  Truep  pMy ListView control is ownerdrawn and the code for my DrawItem event looks like sop  precodeProtected Overrides Sub OnDrawIteme As DrawListViewItemEventArgs     Try         If Not e.State And ListViewItemStates.Selected  0 Then             Draw the background for a selected item.             e.Graphics.FillRectangleSystem.Drawing.SystemBrushes.Highlight, e.Bounds             e.DrawFocusRectangle         Else             Draw the background for an unselected item.             e.Graphics.FillRectangleSystem.Drawing.SystemBrushes.Control, e.Bounds         End If          e.DrawBackground         e.DrawDefault  True         MyBase.OnDrawIteme      Catch ex As Exception         MsgBoxException Error  amp ex.Message, MsgBoxStyle.Critical, Module lsvOverdueCallsDrawItem     End Try End Sub codepre  pIf I remove the codee.DrawDefault  Truecode it removes the checkboxes, but then I cant control the bold face font for a new notification.p  pAny help appreciated.

Negative 6554 pIm a newbie here  Hi, you can call me Bri  I need some help working with Actionscript2 coding in a game Im making with Macromedia Flash Professional 8. I know its a bit dated Im upgrading soon   p  pIts a catching game  strongI have eggs falling from the sky.  When my catcher catches an egg, the score goes up by one point.strong  My hit test works, and I have 2 types of eggs falling Blue and Pink. Theyre both worth 1 point when caught.  p  pI just added a timer to my game.  emWhat I need to happen is When strongthe timer hits zerostrong, the game goes to the gameover screen so that the players can restart the game.

Negative 6554 pThis may be annoying and discussed before but I could not find a good reference which would help to set a direction. I have to plan a migration of TopLink 10g Spring 2.5 ORM Native Support to JPA. I need some guidelines steps to follow and plan a successful migration.p  pLet me brief what I have in my technology stack. Primarily, as I mentioned above, application build around Spring 2.5 and Spring 2.5 Native ORM Support of TopLink. Spring 2.5 bundled to support only up to TopLink 10g and if you simply upgrade the TopLink JAR with the latest version it would not work as latest version of TopLink has completely changed the packaging but this still can be tackled by easily find and replace the package names. The main issue is the native api of TopLink ORM in Spring 2.5 which is built around TopLink 10g.p  pThe reason of this migration activity is we cannot upgrade Spring until we migrate datalayer to JPA.p  pPlease share steps if you already achieved something similar in your past or if the above briefing gives you an understanding on the problem you can also drop your opinion on how should I plan this migration.p

Negative 6554 pI had thought this was a reasonable pattern to use to call WebClient DownloadData asynchronously in an event handlerp  precodeprivate async void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e      WebClient wc  new WebClient     wc.Proxy  null     byte[] bytes  await wc.DownloadDataTaskAsynchttpwww.google.com     label1.Text  Encoding.ASCII.GetStringbytes  codepre  pBut I find DownloadDataTaskAsync blocks for about 5 seconds before returning unless the wc.Proxy  null statement is uncommented. Whats the point of a method being awaitable if it can at a whim perform nontrivial work before even returning the taskp  pPresumably this means to be safe I should strongneverstrong call xAsync methods as above but instead should always wrap them in a Task.Run myself to be sure. Or notp

The site will mostly be in html, js, and php. I will be hosting with bluehostp  pIs there any way of doing this Thanks in advance Littleswanyp

Negative 6554 pI implemented a web service that acts both as a server and a client. So, there is another web service that calls my web service and I forward the call to another web service. So, my web service is acting as a middleman. I implemented the web service using SpringWS, and I chose annotations over XML. So, there is no XML configuration file. When I act as a client and use HTTP to talk to another web service, I get the correct results back. However, I need to make HTTPS requests and I could not find good examples on what needs to be implemented in SpringWS client.

Is there a mechanism in Spring to check if the cert that I get from the server is the right onep

Negative 6554 pI am using XSockets to send real time image data to any connected clients. Each image is fairly largeup to 1080p quality and the video can be up to 30fps. Therefore there is a fair amount of data being shifted around. Whenever I get a new image I trigger an event and currently pass the raw byte array to the client as so p  precodevoid NewImagebyte[] imgData      this.InvokeToAllimgData, newimage  codepre  pMy java script handler is currently empty and isnt even doing anything with the received dataI have ensure it works by printing a message etc. when a new image is received.p  pWithout the InvokeToAll code my program runs without any issue and I have used the same code to render to Winforms before without any issue. After running this code for a few seconds it falls over due to an out of memory exception. Is there something I am missing here, the imgData is nulled from where it is sentafter sending it to the clients and the code works outside of XSockets without any issues.p

Negative 6554 pIm converting an application from C WebForms to MVC.p  pThe application gets settings from a centralized location using Web Services.  These are settings you would typically find in a Web.Config, but the desire of the company is to store these values in a centralized location for all apps.  p  pCurrently, any time you request an application setting, it checks HttpContext.Cache to see if youve already retrieved the settings.  If you havent, it makes the web service call, and stores the settings 100 objects that are essentially keyvalues in the HttpContext.Cache.  So the call to get application settings only occurs once.p  pShould I be looking at another way to do this  I was thinking the settings should just be a REST service call where you pass the key and get a value the current service is an .ashx which is really not ideal for exception handling amoung other reasons.  But obviously this would result in more web requests.  What is considered a best practice here  Is the current method fine and I should just leave the code working the same in the MVC appp

Negative 6554 pI need to develop a catalogue mobile app, that will be used as products brochure by the sales employees of the company. I need that the whole catalog of products the list of products, the single product page, the product search is accessible also when the device is offline.p  pIm sure that this could be easly done developing the app as a native app. But I strongly would prefer to develop it in HTML5 as a web app. But Im not sure that the HTML5 web app supports the offline access.p  pSearching on Google I found that if the cache is less than 5MB a web app works well as a native app. But in my scenario the catalogue of products is composed by 120 products, eachone with gallery of photos. So it is much more bigger than 5MB.p  pIn your opinion, how can I deal with the offline access requirement Maybe an hybrid solution, composed by half a web app and half a native app Feel free to suggest your approach.

Negative 6554 pIm looking in a book I have for algorithms and came across this problem which Im having trouble understanding. Using a max heap p  pLARGE is the bigger half of numbers to be sorted. I.E. LARGE   n2, n2  1, ... n p  pInitially, how many items in LARGE can be within the top log n4 levels of the heap, after build heap phase of HeapSortp  pLet A be the items in LARGE which are neither in the bottom level nor within the top log n4 levels initially. At least how many items are in Ap  pAs found out in a previous answer, the number of elements in LARGE that can initially be on the bottom level is 2h1. My theory is that if I find the ones in the top log n  4 levels, I can subtract the bottom from the top and find the middle ones. Not sure how to go about finding the top levels though. I can assume n is large enough to make the quarter of levels even, i.e. 8 levels  4  2 levels for each quarter.p

Negative 6554 pI have an NSTimer in an iOS that is polling a database server at every 10th seconds for a data row in a table based upon a certain data ID, that has been sent as an argument via a PHPscript. If the data ID matches the data ID of the row that have been inserted by an external source then the app will show an alert box containing the information from the data row and the NSTimer will stop to tick.p  pBut this only works while the app is running in the foreground and I want to show the information message as a local notification so that even though the user has exited from the app, it will still poll the server when the app is running in the background as well.p  pI have read on many sites that the Local Notification service and background fetch is the right kind of solution but I dont know how to set it up really, it is very confusing. Because I have seen many examples where Local Notification is used to send reminders at certain dates on the calendar and trigger alarms at certain times and not so much about polling to a server.p  pHow do you set up a Local Notification that will poll to a server at the interval of 10 seconds and then cancel it as soon as it receives right kind of information that it will display at lastp  pHere is how I have done so farp  precode...

Negative 6554 pMy class contains a list myObjects and my class then have a method which need to return an filtered view of the content of this list.p  pFor this I use the FilterIteratorlt from org.apache.commons.collections4.iterators.FilterIteratorp  pThen I can create a filter iterator, which gives the caller exactly the objects which fulfill my predicate. p  pThat works well, but there is one problem.

Negative 6554 pI have setup a view in playground to test some code. I usually divide my drawing code into sections and call the different functions from within drawRect call of UIView. In playground calling another function to draw from drawRect seems to go to an infinite loop. Here is the codep  precodeclass MyView UIView      override func drawRectrect CGRect          aCircle            func aCircle              let rect  CGRectx 20, y 20, width 100, height 100          var Path  UIBezierPathovalInRect rect          UIColor.blackColor.set         Path.fill          let testView  MyViewframe CGRectx 0, y 0, width 300, height 300  testView.backgroundColor  UIColor.whiteColor codepre  phowever if I take out the aCircle function out of the class structure and call it from the drawRect it draws as expected but if the function call is not placed above the class declaration it give an error message in the drawRect call where aCircle is calledp  precodeUse of unresolved identifier aCircle codepre  pAny suggestions of keeping the call within the UIView class.

Negative 6554 pIve been messing around with Java a lot lately amp Ive found that for my purposes, I need several different objects to be able to communicate with amp instantiate one particular class which generates a GUI JFrame with all variables, fields, etc. that the other classes need to edit. The simplest but probably erroneous way I found to do that is to instantiate the GUI class in the MainClass file, and then when I instantiate the other classes that explicitly require access to methods and variables in the GUI class, I simply pass on the GUI object to them.p  pMy issue is, Im not able to figure out if this just opens access to an already created object, or creates a new one entirely. In the case of the latter, then opening up several new GUI objects will just duplicate everything amp waste resources with no gain whatsoever, so thats what I want to avoid.p  pIll include the haphazardly made code below, so my question is will this create new redundant objects, or does this just let other classes access that one instance without creating new onesp  pMain Class codep  precodepublic class PlateauMainClass      param args the command line arguments    PlateauJGui plateauGui GenerateGUI plateauGuiDataGen  PlateauMainClass       Instantiate the plateauGui object, then pass it into the GUI generator.

Negative 6554 pI have tried searching google for this for quite some time and have had no luck find what I need. What I am trying to do is I have a few different versions of the same image these versions being derived from the original by dithering them to a palette. The image is split into 8x8 tiles that use one of n palettes. I want to pick which palette looks best. There are a few questions on stackoverflow relating to image difference however they suggest a simple algorithm SigmaR1subnsubR2subnsubsup2supG1subnsubG2subnsubsup2supB1subnsubB2subnsubsup2sup and picking the lowest sum. Some suggest that to improve this a better delta algorithm can be used, I have tried CIEDE2000 still found the results unsatisfactory and in many instances I can manually pick a better tile. Note that I did do a bit of verification of my implementation of CIEDE2000 using precomputed data and used this library for a hrefhttpwww.getreuer.infohomecolorspace relnofollowhttpwww.getreuer.infohomecolorspacea rgb to CIELab so I doubt that the reason I am a bit disappointed with the results is due to a bug and most of the time it does an okay job. What I want to do is implement a better algorithm than just the delta to pick the best tile. Does anyone know of a good algorithm for this inclusive or better terminology so that when I search for this I find more relevant informationp

Negative 6554 pIm attempting to use Shiro for Authentication and Authorization for a JSF Web Application Im building.  Unfortunately, Im still having some difficulty wrapping my head around how it all fits together.p  pIve been successful 100 using the shiro.ini file configuring authentication back to a JDBC realm where a test set of credentials are stored.  It has worked perfectly for me when credentials are stored in plaintext.  p  pMy ultimate goal is to unify an existing credential set in a MySQL database.  The passwords are stored as SHA256 salted hashes.  Ive spent an entire day reading over the documentation minus Javadocs that is available, but Im still having some difficulty understanding exactly how to set it up.p  pIn an attempt to implement in stages, Ive modified my shiro.ini as follows with the intention of simply using SHA256 hashesp  precode[main] dataSource  org.apache.shiro.jndi.JndiObjectFactory dataSource.resourceName  jdbcCommunicatordev jdbcRealm  org.apache.shiro.realm.jdbc.JdbcRealm jdbcRealm.dataSource  dataSource dataSource.resourceRef  true  jdbcRealm.authenticationQuery  select password from account where siteid   jdbcRealm.userRolesQuery  select userrole from webroles where siteid     From httpstackoverflow.comquestions20742666shirowithjdbcandhashedpasswords.  passwordService  org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.DefaultPasswordService configure the passwordService to use the settings you desire ... passwordMatcher  org.apache.shiro.authc.credential.PasswordMatcher passwordMatcher.passwordService  passwordService ...

I know that I need to use a different token to ultimately implement the Salted Hashes stored in my RDBMS, but Im confused on how to proceed.p  p1 I dont want to reinvent the wheel.  Does Shiro have something that does this natively  Ive checked out Les links to PasswordMatcher and PasswordService from link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20742666shirowithjdbcandhashedpasswordsshiro with jdbc and hashed passwordsa but this still isnt clear.

Is that supplied by the Realm  Since Realms encapsulate the actual security data, is this an object created from, in my case, the SQL queries that return the password from the RDBMSp  pThank you very much for your time  Im hoping to be able to contribute to the documentation when I get my head wrapped around it all.p

Negative 6554 pstrongBackground Infostrongp  pIve been programming in Java for a while, and Ive only switched over to C just a few months ago, so I apologize if the answer is just something silly that I missed Now that thats all been said, it is time for the issue at hand  I am developing a basic textbased game engine, and I recently ran into an interestingly specific and unlikely problem.  I tried testing it out on a smaller scale in the program below, and decided to just show that as opposed to my actual game code, as to not choke the screen, and make the issue less convoluted.  The problem modeled below mirrors the problem with my actual code, just without the fluffy distractors.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pEssentially the problem is one of polymorphism.  I want to overload the output operator ltlt to serve as a display function that is unique for each object in the hierarchy.  The issue is that when I call this operator from a list which stores these hierarchy members, they lose their identity and call the output operator of the base class.  Normally, one would solve this by replacing the operator overloads with a simple display method, marking the display method virtual, and moving on with their happy day.  I dont particularly mind making that alteration to the code, but now Im just plain curious.  Is there a way to overload operators in a hierarchy that results in what Im going for herep  pstrongThe [Example] Codestrongp  precodeinclude ltvectorgt include ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  class Polygon      friend ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp os, const Polygonamp p public  private     class Rectangle  public Polygon      friend ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp os, const Rectangleamp r public  private     class Square  public Rectangle      friend ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp os, const Squareamp s public  private    ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp os, const Polygonamp p      os ltlt Polygon ltlt endl     return os  ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp os, const Rectangleamp r      os ltlt Rectangle ltlt endl     return os  ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp os, const Squareamp s      os ltlt Square ltlt endl     return os    int main      vectorltPolygongt listOfPoly     listOfPoly.pushbacknew Polygon     listOfPoly.pushbacknew Rectangle     listOfPoly.pushbacknew Square      forPolygon p  listOfPoly          cout ltlt p       codepre  pstrongOutput for [Example] Codestrongp  precodePolygon Polygon Polygon codepre  pstrongDesired output for [Example] Codestrongp  precodePolygon Rectangle Square codepre

Negative 6554 pIm writing a script interpreter and i first need to tokenize a string containing the source code. For that ive identified different things p  ul liIdentifiers variable names li liSymbols , , etc... including alphabetic operators such as return li liLitteral values true, false, 1, 3.14, foo.li ul  pTo represent this I thought about two different ways  either creating a class hierarchy p  precodeclass Token  public     enum typee  EIDENTIFIER, ESYMBOL, ELITTERAL      const typee type  class Identifier  public Token  public     const string name  class Symbol  public Token  public     const symbole symbol  class Litteral  public Token  public     const Value value  codepre  pWhich i would use with down casts this way p  precodebla bla parseStatement bla bla        ...

Its basically the same thing, just a little shorter to write.p  pI was suggested to use the visitor design pattern, but I cant figure out a way to use this pattern for my problem. strongI want to keep the syntax analyzing logic outside of the tokensstrong. The logic will be in a syntax analyzing class that will manipulate these tokens.  I also need the tokens to either be of the same type or have a common base class so that I can store them in a single array.p  pDo you have an idea how I could design this  Thank you p

Negative 6554 pI created a DNN website on azure from the gallery on azure. I then created a custom module using aspnetC within VS2013. I was able to properly build this and deploy the files using FTP to my DNN on azure and add the module to a page.p  pSo currently my custom DNN module works ok on my azure DNN website. The question now is there anyway to remotely debug this custom module in visual studio that sits on my azure DNN site I installed the azure SDK and did as the steps say to remotely debug a website by right clicking the website and clicking Attach Debugger however none of my breakpoints in my custom module seem to be getting hit. p  pIs there anything I may be missing so I can accomplish this I would like to bypass if possible the need to locally install DNN.p

When user click on login button, the view controller with login form should be dismissed and the view controller with table view should be presented. When user click on logout button, the view controller with table view should be dismissed and the view controller with login form should be presented. For now to switch between the 2 view controllers Im using the following codep  precodeHistoryViewController historyViewController  [[HistoryViewController alloc]init] [self presentViewControllerAsModalWindowhistoryViewController] codepre  pbut if the user click on the logout button it shows me the login view controller and if user press on the close button the red button in top left corner it shows me again the view controller without user is logged in.

Since its already in production I wanted to install two versions on my device the App Store Version and the Development version.p  pI followed this a hrefhttpblog.chrismiles.info201104iosdevbetaproductionbuilds.html relnofollowinstructionsa and successfully installed two versions of the app, but when trying to Log in using Facebook I got a problem because the development version bundleID com.company.app.dev does not matches the registered one on my Facebook App com.company.app.p  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsiostroubleshootingsharedappid relnofollowThis guidea shows how to share the same facebook appID between apps. The guide is quite confusing to me. I registered the two bundle ids com.company.app.dev and com.company.app and one URL scheme suffix dev, and modified mi App.plist file to include the codeFacebookUrlSchemeSuffixcode key.p  pThat lead me into another problem, when I logged into the production app, the callback was opening the development app, because both apps had the same URL callbacks registered fbxxxx and fbxxxxdev, where xxxx is my facebook app id.p  pI solved it registering a userdefined build setting that adds the codeFacebookUrlSchemeSuffixcode when in Build mode and not in Release mode, and also modifying the URL schemes in the App.plist file to append the suffix in the same case.p  pBut this solution seems a bit hacky since it does now follow the Facebook guides. Is there any better solution to this I think Im not following the Facebook guide correctly.p

Negative 6554 pI am just beginning to tackle some USACO practice problems using Java.

They can make a huge   difference in the efficiency of your program Use themp blockquote  pHowever, the Oracle docs say p  blockquote   pStringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility   reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended   that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String   or the java.util.regex package instead.p blockquote  pI am finding very mixed opinions on the internet. Some, including the training pages, say that codeStringTokenizercode should be used because its faster than codeString.splitcode which is faster than codeScannercode though a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma165736734727735thisa answer disagrees.

Negative 6554 pI am working on a project that has an external API that I need to submit an image through, and the requirement of that API is that the image be a TIFF with Group 4 Compression.  I have tried several different approaches to convert my Bitmap to a TIFF including using JAI imageio in Android, porting libtiff into NDK and using OpenCV.  JAI imageio is commonly recommend on here as a possible solution, but I found that even when I found a standalone version of JAI imageio that I still had an unmet dependency on javax.imageio and as a result could not build my app.  Porting libtiff should work, and I have a branch in my code where I have begun this process, but due to the time required to do this I would prefer an alternate solution.  OpenCV I also started to implement, but I decided the requirement to install a secondary OpenCV Manager APK in order to use it is not acceptable for my app, in addition to this being significant overkill for solving a simple problem.p  pCurrently I have been working with the Android port of ImageMagick found here a hrefhttpsgithub.compaulasiimweAndroidImageMagick relnofollowhttpsgithub.compaulasiimweAndroidImageMagicka and this appears to be a promising approach.  So far I have set it up in my app and am able to output the image to a file in order to verify the image.  I am able to use it to convert to a couple different image formats, but when I try to convert to a TIFF I receive a SIGSEGV and the app crashes.p  pThe relevant code snippet isp  precodeMagickImage image  MagickBitmap.fromBitmapsizedImage image.setMagickTIFF image.setImageFormatTIFF image.setDepth1 image.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression  ImageInfo info  new ImageInfo info.setMagickTIFF info.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression  image.writeImageinfo codepre  pI have tried various permutations of the different calls to setMagick and setCompression, all of which yield the same result.  If a call to setMagickTIFF is made, then when it reaches image.writeImageinfo the app will crash with the following outputp  precodeFatal signal 11 SIGSEGV, code 1, fault addr 0x0 in tid 2283 codepre  pHas anyone used ImageMagick in Android to convert to a TIFF, or does anyone know of a clean method of converting to a TIFF in Android that is verified to actually work.  I know that it must be possible because there are apps on the Play Store for converting image formats which include converting to TIFF, including one from Paul Asiimwe, who published this Android port.p  pEDIT 1p  pBy using the following code I am able to get an uncompressed TIFF that appears to be correct in all other regards, but it just will not compress it to Group 4 compression.p  precodeMagickImage image  MagickBitmap.fromBitmapsizedImage image.setDepth1 image.setNumberColors2 ImageInfo info  new ImageInfoEnvironment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectoryEnvironment.DIRECTORYDOWNLOADSoutput.tiff image.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression image.writeImageinfo  info.setColorspaceColorspaceType.GRAYColorspace info.setMonochrome1 info.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression image.writeImageinfo  byte[] blob  image.imageToBlobinfo codepre

In this case use the Add method or the Added entity state to track the graph and then set the state of nonnew entities to Unchanged or Modified as appropriate.p  pModel objectp  precode public class MwbePaymentMethod  BaseEntity              public enum MethodTypeEnum                      Creditcard,             Virtualcard,             Wallet                  public MethodTypeEnum MethodType  get set          public string Number  get set          public DateTime ExpirationDate  get set          public double Balance  get set          public bool IsPending  get set          public bool IsDefault  get set          public MwbeAddress BillingAddress  get set          public MwbeCurrency Currency  get set          public MwbeUserData UserData  get set          public DateTime PaymentDate  get set           [JsonIgnore]         public virtual ICollectionltMwbePaymentgt Payments  get set       codepre  pEdit methodp  precodepublic override void EditMwbePaymentMethod payment                       if payment.Currency  null ampamp payment.Currency.Id  0                              Context.Entrypayment.Currency.State  EntityState.Unchanged                          if payment.UserData  null ampamp payment.UserData.Id  0                              Context.Entrypayment.UserData.State  EntityState.Unchanged                           if payment.BillingAddress  null ampamp payment.BillingAddress.Id  0                              Debugger.Break                  Context.Entrypayment.BillingAddress.State  EntityState.Unchanged                           Context.Entrypayment.State  EntityState.Modified             if Context.Entrypayment.State  EntityState.Detached                              DbSet.Attachpayment                       codepre  pADDED1p  pI changed code a bit, Im reading all Navigation fieldsobject especially for Billing Address which was not fully filled with the same data as they were in database.p  precode public void UpdateMwbePaymentMethodMwbePaymentMethodFilter filter, MwbePaymentMethodDtoInOut mwbepaymentmethod                      var currentPaymentMethod  paymentMethodRepository.FindByx gt x.UserData.Id  filter.userId ampamp x.Id  filter.id             if currentPaymentMethod  null  currentPaymentMethod.Count  1                              throw new DBConcurrencyException                          var mwbePaymentPethod  Mapper.MapltMwbePaymentMethodgtmwbepaymentmethod              load existing user data             mwbePaymentPethod.UserData  userRepository.Getfilter.userId.Data              load existing address with subproperties             mwbePaymentPethod.BillingAddress  addressRepository.FindByx gt x.Id  mwbePaymentPethod.BillingAddress.Id, xgtx.Merchants, xgtx.PaymentMethods, xgtx.Deliveries, xgtx.UserDatas.SingleOrDefault              if mwbePaymentPethod.BillingAddress  null                              throw new DBConcurrencyException                           paymentMethodRepository.EditmwbePaymentPethod             paymentMethodRepository.SaveChanges          codepre  pAnd Edit methodp  precodepublic override void EditMwbePaymentMethod payment               if payment.Currency  null ampamp payment.Currency.Id  0                      Context.Entrypayment.Currency.State  EntityState.Unchanged                  if payment.UserData  null ampamp payment.UserData.Id  0                      Context.Entrypayment.UserData.State  EntityState.Unchanged                   if payment.BillingAddress  null ampamp payment.BillingAddress.Id  0                      Debugger.Break  tutaj byl ostatnio problem             Context.Entrypayment.BillingAddress.State  EntityState.Unchanged                  Context.Entrypayment.State  EntityState.Modified       codepre  pNo matter if p  p1    codeContext.Entrypayment.BillingAddress.State  EntityState.Unchangedcodep  porp  p2 codeContext.Entrypayment.BillingAddress.State  EntityState.Modifiedcodep  pStill the same error is displayed.

Negative 6554 pI am trying to keep track of the number of results per page as I navigate through pages by sending them to a function in Django.  From my understanding the best way to do this is to use an AJAX GET or POST call, but I cant seem to get it working.p  pI have a function called codemyFunctioncode in my codeviews.pycode file that I want to pass my number of results per page to so I can manage the pagination between pages.

What makes me think its not working is when I print the coderequest.GETcode I dont see the codenumresultscode parameter that I thought I was passing in with my ajax call. Plus, I get an error for trying to use a codeNoneTypecode because there is no codenumresultscode parameter.  I feel like Django and jQueryAjax should make this process relatively simple, but my total lack of experience with JavaScript is making this extremely difficult for me.p  pIf anyone could either point out where I am going wrong or has a link to a more elegant or correct solution that would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 6554 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI use a small static hash table linear probing which I need in a stage in a OpenGL rendering pipeline, where I must retrieve and update int64t type keys and some data as fast as possible. In short, this stage is about translating large IDs to small local indices that subsequent stages use so here in this stage I relly need to deal with 64 bit keys once, and cant use 32 bit keys. p  pIve experimented long to find a hash function that works fast on both 32 bit and 64 bit arm architectures iOS and Android smartphones. Naturally, on 32 bit devices hashing of 64 bit keys is much slower than hashing 32 bit keys almost 10 times in my test case. p  pIm now very confident with the hash I found here on SO, which outperforms the MurmurHash3 32 bit finalizer in my case with some more collissions, but doesnt matter in my case a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma129960281708349httpstackoverflow.coma129960281708349ap  pAll works fine and well for now, but here s the catch I naively assign the 64 bit key to an int32t type before hashing it  this is done for performance reasons for the 32 bit platforms.

Negative 6554 pI am trying to write a code using vba that allows me to automatically create a schedule in excel that changes grey squares to white squares based on hours scheduled.  The sheet contains a column of the names of all the employees working on a particular day with a cell next to it showing what hours they are working. Then there is a column for each hour that our business is open from 8am to 9pm.  The hours show as a text string that reads exactly for example 1200p800p so I need to make the the cells in that row from 12pm to 8pm turn white they are default grey.  So it would read something like this G being grey and W being whitep  pFirst cell contains employee name.   Second hours scheduled.  Next 13 cells  hours we are open.p  pSam Smith1200p800pGGGGWWWWWWWWGp  pSo when I import my weekly schedule into the appropriate cells, I need to be able to click a button that automatically turns those cells grey or white depending on the two different values in the text string, which is where I cant seem to get any help, I need excel to somehow know for instance that I need my if statement to say basically if the first time in the text string is 1200p then anything greater than that should be a white cell but only until the 800p in the text string, which is way beyond my expertise.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.  If this is already covered and I missed it a link would be great, but I cant seem to find it, thanksp

Negative 6554 pIve recently migrated a project from Maven to Gradle IE replaced the pom.xml file with a build.gradle file.  Since my company still has several downstream Maven projects that depend on it we must continue to publish a pom file along with class, source, and javadoc JARs to our Nexus repository so that the downstream projects can still consume this project as a Maven dependency.

Once thats completed it will publish the jars to the buildtestsnapshot Nexus repository.p  pThis works perfectly fine on my machine as well as our build servers and most of my coworkers boxes.  However, some coworkers have been complaining because the gradlew publish command note that a Gradle 2.4 wrapper has been included with the project is failing on them with errors like thesep  pre classlangtext prettyprintoverridecodeCUsersuserPerforceWORKSPACEprojectsrcmainjavacommycompanytestrandomizati onRandomHelper.java18 error unmappable character for encoding Cp1252     private static final String NONENGLISHCHARACTERS  1234567890    amp. codepre  pInterestingly enough, the gradlew build command which compiles the project using javac executes just fine on everyones machines.  Its the gradlew publish command which has problems on some machines either passing or failing on both Mac and Windows.p  pI cant tell what the key difference is here, but I suspect that the affected users have their Perforce clients misconfigured no P4CHARSET specified and have all of the project files synced to their machines with the default encoding.  Its not clear to me how to check what encoding Perforce used when syncing though, so this is just a theory.  As far as I understand, even if they fix their configurations theyll still need to wipe out their enlistments and download everything from the Perforce server again to get all of the files with the correct encoding utf16lebom.p  pRegardless of any Perforce issues the blame is falling back on me since Im the one that switched us over to Gradle in the first place.  If theres some way that I can configure the mavenpublish plugin to work around the issue then Id prefer to do that.  If javac can compile the nonstandard characters from these files into classes then theres no reason that the plugin cant read them and generate javadoc for them, right  Maybe it needs to be explicitly told what encoding to usep  pIve already tried playing around with the Dfile.encodingxUTF16LEBOM option in JAVAOPTS and GRADLEOPTS this made no difference.  Ive also found the following snippet used for specifying the encoding for Compile tasks in Gradlep  precodetasks.withTypeCompile      options.encoding  xUTF16LEBOM  codepre  pUnfortunately, this is for Compile tasks, and the project is already compiling successfully.  Im not sure what type of tasks the mavenpublish plugin is generating, so I dont know how to apply this approach for those tasks is this possible.p  pstrongWhat else can I try to make the Gradle mavenpublish plugin stop tripping over fileencodingsstrongp

Negative 6554 pI have an Observable generated from a regular .NET event. The Observable is hot  not emwarmem  in the sense that it starts producing values even before any subscription, and everytime someone subscribes it will receive the latest produced value. Lets name this codeeventStreamcode.p  pThen I have another Observable, exposed by another class, which represents some emstate flowem, so every new value gives the current state of something managed by that class. This Observable is hot as well. Lets name it codestateStreamcode.p  pEverytime the event sequence produces a new value, I want to pick Id say emsampleem, but that might lead to confusion the latest value provided by state sequence. This should produce a new sequence, combining the two values, then processing them, etc.p  pThis is what I came up with, but it does not seem to work thoughp  precodevar eventStream  Observable.FromEventPatternltMyEventArgsgt... var stateStream  someDependency.SomeStateStream  eventStream.SelecteventValue gt    stateStream     .Take1     .SelectstateValue gt new  Event  eventValue, State  stateValue    .Switch   .Dovalue gt logger.Trace 0, 1 , value.Event, value.State   .Subscribevalue gt  do something  codepre  pThe rationale behind that is taken from other similar scenarios I worked with, where a new value produced by some source causes a new subscription to run, thus a strongnewstrong Observable gets returned, and finally the codeIObservableltIObservablelt...gtgtcode gets squashed into a emonedimensionalem IObservable again using codeSwitchcode or some similar operator.br But in this case, from a quick test, there seems to be no new subscription, and  only the very first codestateStreamcode value gets produced. Instead Id like to pick the first value codeTake1code everytime the codeeventStreamcode emfiresem.p  pAFAIK, codeCombineLatestcode and codeZipcode cannot fit the bill codeCombineLatestcode fires everytime one of the two sequences provides a new value codeZipcode fires everytime both sequences have a new value available, and tipically this means when the slowest of the two has values. codeAndThenWhencode should not be right as well for same reason as codeZipcode.p  pIve also checked SO thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27507484combiningoneobservablewithlatestfromanotherobservablecombining one observable with latest from another observablea, but I dont think that can apply here.

Negative 6554 pFirstly to give you an idea of the scale, let me tell you that my web server needs to handle requests from 10k users in parallel, each user sends up a post request. Now coming to each users request, the processing of each request is a CPU intensive work, the entire response for each request may take few minutes to over an hour to generate. However we have to send out the response in tiny packets as soon as they are ready continuously for the next 1 hour. From users end there would not be any request in the meantime except the fact he may wish to terminate the entire process altogether.  I am building such a system from scratch starting now in 2015, what should be the best choice for it at this point of time. Let me also mention here if it matters anyhow in making a decision that this system would eventually be integrated with a node.js website.p
Negative 6554 pThe project I am working at the moment uses camel as the routing framework. When configuring camel context in spring we pass a property file that contains a bunch of global properties needed when configuring camel routes or for controlling run time behaviorp  precodeltcamelcamelContext xmlnshttpcamel.apache.orgschemaspring idmyidgt     ltcamelpropertyPlaceholder locationmysystem.properties idglobalpropertiesgt     ... ltcamelcamelContextgt codepre  pand say mysystem.properties has an entry like belowp  precodemysystem.properties  Global properties that control mysystem configuration and run time ... foobar  ... codepre  pWhen configuring the routes I can access codefoocode property using the codefoocode notation. It is also available to other beans using codePropertyInjectcode annotation. However there is one use case in my design when a plain POJO not created by spring an enum instead but this is not relevant needs to access my codefoocode property. Because this POJO it is passed the CamelContext as a method argument I find it natural to think I should be able to get the value of codefoocode from there. However I spent a bit of time and could not figure out by myself how.p  pI know I can load the properties file again or even get the system property codeSystem.getPropertybarcode and everything will work but it looks like cheating to me.p  pThank you in advance for your inputs.p

However, since I still need to provide support in the functions of my library again, parsing, printing, etc I will be still using this node in different places in my code base.p  pI would like to avoid the deprecation warnings that I get while using this definition. It seems to me that this is legitimate use of a deprecated class, and would like to be able to tell the compiler dont worry about it, this is ok.p  pTo clarify with a small example, suppose the followingp  precodedeprecatedstop using OutdatedNode, 1.5 case class OutdatedNodex Int extends Tree  def printertree Tree String  tree match    ...   case OutdatedNodex gt outdatednode   x     ...  codepre  pThe codeprintercode function needs to continue working for end users that decide to still use the codeOutdatedNodecode, but by implementing it this way I get warnings when I compile my library.p

Negative 6554 pAs stated, how should we properly save a captured signature using SignaturePad component to a SQL Server database Well it should be easy, considering the GetImagefalse method used by the component returns a Bitmap and later on compress the Bitmap into a JPEG and into an array byte using a Stream. The byte array should then be saved directly to the SQL Server database however, the problem with this approach is that when you retrieve the image from the database, the image is all black. Its like the strokes were never captured, funny thing though is that the background color of the a hrefhttpscomponents.xamarin.comgettingstartedsignaturepad relnofollowSignaturePada was set to White and the stroke color is Black.p  pXamarin.Android Button OnClick Event Handlerp  precodevar signature  this.SignatureView.GetImagefalse  This returns the Bitmap from SignaturePad. var imageData  this.ImageToByteArraysignature  This converts the Bitmap to byte[].  var result  this.SaveDataAsyncimageData  Save the byte[] to the database. codepre  pXamarin.Android Extension Methodp  precodeprivate byte[] ImageToByteArrayBitmap image      if image  null return null      byte[] result      using var stream  new MemoryStream              image.CompressCompressFormat.Jpeg, 100, stream         result  stream.ToArray         stream.Flush           return result  codepre  pThis is the same approach we did on iOS, but doesnt work on Android.

Negative 6554 pI have started working on jTable, a jQuery plugin to create grids. I was going through the documentation. There I came across 2 terms  data.record and data.row. I have always understood that rows and records are synonymous. But obviously, in JTable, they mean different things and am not sure about the difference. It will be great if anybody can shed some light on this. Thanks in advance.p
