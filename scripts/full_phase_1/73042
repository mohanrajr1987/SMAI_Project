Positive 73042 pIm currently displaying a Kendo UI Grid in a modal.  Ive got a few custom validations hooked up which are working fine.  When the modals Save button is clicked, I need to be able to check whether the grid is currently in a valid or invalid state.  p  pSince Im only using custom validation, its certainly possible for me to keep a running track of the errors and then check the error count upon the modal closing, but I was hoping the Kendo UI Grid kept up with this and exposed something easy like myGrid.isValid or some such thing.p

Positive 73042 pHave a very simple task that for some reason is not working. What we are trying to do is allow the user to create an object in this case a filter, add it to an Angular drop down, and then set the drop down to that user created value.p  pEverything is working except the setting of the drop down.

If, for example what Im dealing with now I want to attach a dropdownlist editor for Department,p  precodeHtml.Kendo.DropDownList     .NameDepartment     .BindToSystem.Collections.IEnumerableViewData[Department]  codepre  pkendo will look at the .Name in the DropDownList, and attach the template to the first element it comes to with the proper id.

Negative 73042 pIve got an ASP.NET MVC VB project with two models that represent two different databases. Each model needs to include a table from its database with the same name. For example, model1.dbml needs to have db1.MyTable in it, and model2.dbml needs to have db2.MyTable in it.p  pI cant do this because both models try to create a Partial Public Class MyTable, and both have Public Sub New, so you get the multiple definitions with identical signatures error.p  pThere is a potential for a number of the tables between the models to have the same name.

Negative 73042 pFirst off, let me define the end goal p  pId like to Wordpress version 2.8 to manage the authentication datacredentials and access control for a web site. Wordpress will be used for most of the site, but some pages will be built outside of the Wordpress environment. These pages should be able to use the user authenticaion data stored Wordpress database as a reference to make their own decisions about access.p  pSo, the questionp  pHow, exactly, does Wordpress store user authentication data in its databasep  phr p  pThe first part of this answer is easy, inside the Wordpress database, there is a table that holds the primary user data. I believe the default name for this table is wpusers but that can change based on the way Wordpress is setup. This table contains the fields userlogin and userpass which hold the username and password data, respectively.p  pThe userlogin is simply a plain text field, so that is easy enough to access, but the password is salted and hashed. This leads to the first thing that still needs to be determined what is the salting and hashing process Wordpress uses for generating the strings that it stores in userpassp  pThe other portion that remains open is wherehow Wordpress stores its roles. In my install, these roles default to Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor and Subscriber. What I dont see is how these roles are associated with individual users. Also, can these role alteredp  phr p  pSo, to recap, the real question is in three partsp  p1 What is the specific method Wordpress uses to transpose users plaintext passwords to the strings that are stored in the userpass column of the wpusers database tablep  p2 Where are the links between individual users and their respective Wordpress roles storedp  p3 Can roles in Wordpress be modified to change their names andor addremove themp  phr p  pNote I realize that another approach would be to have nonWordpress pages check the Wordpress cookie to determine access. Im going to create another question along those lines, but for purposes of this question the focus is on how nonWordpress pages can utilize the actual Wordpress database for decisions on access control.p

This way all test results should be displayed by fixture even though theyre not gathered in a single run.p

Negative 73042 pIm building a website that constructs both sitewide and userspecific activity feeds.  I hope that you can see the structure below and share you insight as to whether my solution is doing the job.  This is complicated by the fact that I have multiple types of users that right now are not stored in one master table.  This is because the types of users are quite different and constructing multiple different tables for user metadata would I think be too much trouble.  In addition, there are multiple types of content that can be acted upon, and multiple types of activity following, submitting, commenting, etc.. p  pConstructing a sitewide activity feed is simple because everything is logged to the main feed table and I just build out a list.  I have a master feed table in MySQL that simple logsp  ol litype of activity litype of target entity liid of target entity litype of source entity i.e., user or organization liid of source entity. ol   pThis is just a big reference table that points the script generating the feed to the appropriate tables for each feed entry.p  pIn generating the userspecific feed, Im trying to figure out some way to join the relationship table with the feed table, and using that to parse results.  I have a relationships table, comprised of following relationships, that is similar to the feed table.  It is simpler though bc only one type of user is allowed to follow other content typesusers. p  ol liusersource id litype of target entity liid of target entity. ol  pColumns 2 amp 3 in the feed and follow table are the same, and I have been trying to use various JOIN methodologies to match them up, and then limit them by any relationships in the follow table that the user has.  This is has not been very successful.p  pThe basic query I am using isp  precode SELECT   FROM feed as fe LEFT OUTER JOIN follow as fo                      ON fe.feedtargettype  fo.followetype                         AND fo.followeid  fe.feedtargetid  WHERE fo.followuid  1 OR fe.feedeid  1        AND fe.feedetype  user  ORDER BY fe.feedtimestamp desc LIMIT 10 codepre  pThis query also attempts to grab any content that the user has created which data is logged in the feed table that the user is, in effect, following by default.p  pThis query seems to work, but it took me sometime to get to it and am pretty sure Im missing a more elegant solution.

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observeramp8212excellent for drawing the veil from menamp8217s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. ltpgt  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. ltpgt  One nightamp8212it was on the twentieth of March, 1888amp8212I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice, when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the wellremembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.             ltdivgt          ltdivgt      ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre

Here is an example of the  non functional  codep  precodePublic Function RetrieveDataid as Long   Dim result as String     This returns either Disabled or Loading   result  Application.Worksheet.Function.RTDSERVERNAME, , id   RetrieveData  result    Ifresult  Disabled Then       Obviously, this recurses and fails, so thats not an option     IfNot IsEmptyApplication.Caller.Value2 Then         So does this       RetrieveData  Application.Caller.Value2      End If    End If End Function codepre  pThe function will be called in thousands of cells, so storing the original values in another data structure would be a major overhead and I would like to avoid it. Also, the RTD server does not know the values, since it also does not keep a history of it, more or less for the same reason.p  pI was thinking that there might be some way to exit the function which would force it to not change the displayed value, but so far I have been unable to find anything like that.p  pAny ideas on how to solve this are greatly appreciatedp  pThanks, Chep  pstrongEDITstrongbr Due to popular demand, some additional info on why I want to do all this As I said, the function will be called in thousands of cells and the RTD server needs to retrieve quite a bit of information. This can be quite hard on both network and CPU. To allow the user to decide for himself whether he wants this load on his machine, he or she can disable the updates from the server. In that case, he or she should still be able to calculate the sheets with the values currently in the fields, yet no updates are pushed into them. Once new data is required, the server can be enabled and the fields will be updated.p  pAgain, since we are talking about quite a bit of data here, I would rather not store it somewhere in the sheet. Plus, the data should be usable even if the workbook is closed and loaded again.p

Negative 73042 pI am working on an extension for visual studio to update a project.br The situation is a follows  p  ol liWe create a new project from a template.  li liWe put the solution in tfsli liWe change the project which was used to create the template. The project on the tfs server still needs te be updated.li liWe publish the project to a folder. I now want to update the files in the TFS repo with the current files in the publish folder  li ol  pI thought of the following approachbr In the application we have all the project stored that are on the TFS server. When I want to update a specific project I select the project from the database. Next I load this project from the TFS server and create a new checkout for this project. So far so good. The problem arise when I copy the files from the published folder to the new checkout. Files that are already registered in the workspace get marked as changed but the files that are new are not added.  p  pThe only solution I can think of is to add all the files through the TFS SDK. But this seems pretty heavy to me.  p  pSo I got a couple of questions  p  ol liIs this the right approach to update the projectli liIs there any other way to add the files to the workspace instead of adding all files through the TFS SDKli ol  pThanksp

Ive also tried building PurchaseOrder objects from the contents of mid, inserting them into a new List of PurchaseOrders, and converting that list into a queryable to assign to po to pass on to the next block.  However, that changes pos data type from System.Data.Object.ObjectSet to System.Collections.Generic.List, which then throws an InvalidOperationException the next time I try and iterate through it using a foreach.p  pSo my question is, are there any obvious mistakes in my approach or any suggestions for other ways to approach the problem  Thanks very much for any help.p

Negative 73042 pWe have a mature Wince 6.0 R2 custom device that is capable of downloading files via WiFi and storing them in a NAND flash FAT file system partition.  This has been running on over 15000 devices around the world for over a year now, but recently on some test systems for new software and OS versions, we have been seeing some file system corruptions where a particular directory seems to have a recursive link back to the top level Flash contents.  In particular, we have a FlashManifest directory that includes a subdirectory called GCMaps. Normally this contains a number of map images, but when the corruption occurs, it also includes all of the high level Flash files and subdirectories in an apparent recursive loop, e.g. FlashManifestGCMapsprogram.exe and FlashManifestGCMapsManifestGCMapsManifest...p  pIt is always the same directory that has the problem, and it is happening on multiple devices on our test rack, although many of our test devices are completely unaffected.  I am able to temporarily fix the affected devices by either reformatting the file system partition or by erasing the entire flash device, repartitioning, reflashing the OS, and recreating the file system.  But the affected devices continue to develop the corruption within a couple of days.p  pRecent testing has shown that the file system remains intact after changing the Manifest files multiple times, but then we have an automated reboot at midnight, and upon bootup, some of the affected devices exhibit the problem.p  pWhat is strange is that we have not recently changed any of the manifest download or integration logic, nor anything that has anything to do with GCMaps at all.  One major change I have made recently was to remove the Windows Shell and run our devices in Kiosk Mode with our applications being the only UI.p  pHas anyone encountered this kind of recursive directory corruption on CE before, and if so, did you find a solution  Is there any reason that removing the shell could have caused this  Any suggestions or information would be appreciatedp  pThanks, Rich Jonesp

Negative 73042 pI have scriptA and siteB that I submit my form to. Script B is a separate script that isnt mine so I cant change any of its settings..However, ScriptA is mine so I can post that script below. Given a login screen, a user puts in their login credentials then clicks login. After this, the form POSTS to scriptB which is in the action attribute of the form, then the form using JQUERY POSTS to scriptA. scriptB I dont care about, I just need to POST the form to it and thats that. ScriptA that is POSTED to takes the credentials POSTED to it and does an LDAP bind to see if the credentials match to the ones in DB, if they match, user is redirected to www.examplesite.com, if the given credentials are false then user is sent back to login screen saying invalid username and password.p  pScriptB redirects on submission which I dont want, I dont even care what scriptB does, I just have to POST the credentials to it. I care about scriptA, once scriptA gets the proper credentials it should redirect the user. I cant make changes to scriptB so I have to somehow ignore its redirect.p  pWhat happens currently 1 At login screen user hits submit after entering credentials 2 ScriptB is POSTED to through the action atribute, ScriptA is POSTED to through JQUERY 3 ScriptB redirects the user to www.examplesite.comp  pWhat strongshouldstrong happen 1 At login screen user hits submit after entering credentials 2 ScriptB is POSTED to through the action atribute, ScriptA is POSTED to through JQUERY 3 If scriptA finds the credentials wrong, it should redirect back to login screen with message invalid login. 4 once the user enters correct credentials at login screen user and scriptA approves these credentials, redirect user to www.example2site.comp  pBelow is my scriptA, if I POST to it without scriptB then scriptA works just as intended but here I am trying to merge these 2 together.p  pscriptA is basically a website login authentication and it authenticates through LDAP bind.p  pWorking login screen code that submits to both the scriptsp  precode    ltform actionhttpservicedesk.site.comjsecuritycheck methodpost idform nameAuth classappnitrogt         ltdiv classformdescriptiongt             lth2gtLoginlth2gt          ltdivgt               ltul gt                      ltli idli1 gt         ltlabel classdescription forelement1gtUsername ltlabelgt         ltdivgt             ltinput idelement1 namejusername classelement text medium typetext maxlength255 valuegt         ltdivgt         ltligt       ltli idli2 gt         ltlabel classdescription forelement2gtPassword ltlabelgt         ltdivgt             ltinput idelement2 namejpassword classelement text medium typepassword maxlength255 valuegt         ltdivgt         ltligt                      ltli classbuttonsgt                   ltinput idsaveForm classbuttontext typesubmit namesubmit valueLog In gt         ltligt             ltulgt      ltformgt codepre  pJQUERY CODEp  precode        ltscript languageJavaScript typetextJavaScriptgt document.ready function    form.submitfunction      .ajax       type POST,       async true,       url httpsnoc.sde.site.comokhawajaLoginformLandingauthenticate.php,       data this.serialize,       success functiondata, status, xhr        ,       error functionxhr, status, err          alertstatus     err                               ltscriptgt codepre  pScriptAp  precodeltphp sessionstart  if issetPOST[jusername] ampamp issetPOST[jpassword]       LDAP stuff here.     username  trimPOST[jusername]     password  trimPOST[jpassword]      echoAuthenticating...     ds  ldapconnectldapldapport          ldapsetoptionds, LDAPOPTPROTOCOLVERSION, 3     ldapsetoptionds, LDAPOPTREFERRALS, 0      Cant connect to LDAP.     if ds        SESSION[rdr]Invalid Login.

Negative 73042 pI am trying to go through the mess of COM interop definitions we have scattered across various projects and collect them into a single, knowngood location from which the whole dev team can benefit. Part of this effort involves cleaning up the definitions that have been accumulated over the years. p  pSome of these are borrowed from other source code, some were copied verbatim from pinvoke.net, and some look to be directly translated from the SDK headers. One thing I notice is that there is no consistency about when to use the various marshalling attributes, even among the pinvoke.net examples this is pretty hitormiss. Part of the problem is, I dont think anyone here myself included fully understands when the various attributes are needed or not, or what they actually do. Up to this point, getting these right seems to be a combination of guesswork and random changes until the COMExceptions stop happening, but Id much rather the translations be correct because someone actually looked at them and declared them so.p  pSo, Im starting with code[In]code and code[Out]code. I know what those two attributes do conceptually they inform the marshaller which direction the data has to go. I emassumeem the marshaller, for example, wont bother copying code[In]code data back to the caller, or knows that code[Out]code data might need to be freed on the callee side, etc. The things I dont know arep  ol liWhen is it strongnecessarystrong to use these attributes That is, when is the default marshalling behavior wrong such that the attributes make it correctli liWhen is it strongsafestrong to use these attributes That is, will specifying what should already be the default behavior change the way the marshaller worksli liWhen is it strongdangerousstrong to use these attributes I assume that explicitly marking an output parameter code[In]code is bad, but is marking an input parameter code[In, Out]code actually going to break anythingli ol  pSo, given a hypothetical COM Interface method whose IDL looks like thisp  precodeHRESULT Foo     [in] ULONG a,     [out] ULONG  b     [in, out] ULONG  c codepre  pI might see this translated as any of the followingp  precodevoid Foo   uint cb,   out uint b,   ref uint c  void Foo   uint cb,   [Out] out uint b,   [In, Out] ref uint c  void Foo   [In] uint cb,   [Out] out uint b,   [In, Out] ref uint c codepre  pIs there any functional difference between those three Is any of them considered better than the others for reasons besides technical correctnessp

Negative 73042 pI currently have this working by passing bucketloads of data to PHP and then doing all the calculations there. I want and most likely need to perform all the calculations using MySQL only. I know that it is possible to write functions and procedures in MySQL but Ive never done it before and every time I sit down to get this written I confuse myself into a crying mess of selfdisappointment. So....p  pExplanation of database Lets start with a database diagram a hrefhttpi.imgur.comTh3NL.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comTh3NL.jpga p  pYou can immediately disregard the users table. Well not bother with that in this question.p  pSo this database hold information drawn from web pages. You can see the links table holds the URL and title, as well as the maximum term frequency for any term in that document.p  pThe object table is just to allow both users and links to be foreign primary keys in the occurences table. BTW, I am aware of the constant misspelling of occurrences as occurences p  pThe occurences table holds the majority of data. The table has a primary foreign key of linkoruser though just ignore user for this. It has wordid which refers to the dictionary table, tagid which refers to the tags table and finally score which is the number of occurrences of that word, of that tag type, in that document.p  pThe tags table has a tag id, the name of a tag eg. title, or H1 and its weight which is normally set between 1 and 10.p  pThe dictionary table has a word id, the actual word, and the inverse document frequency of that word. If you care what an IDF is then its the number of web pages, divided by the number of web pages containing that specific word somewhere.p  pExplanation of the systems function Given a link ID well call it BaseID, all other links are compared for similarity cosine similarity and the IDs, url and titles of all links are shown to the user, ordered by most to least similar.p  pScores for each word are occurences.score  tags.weight  links.maxtf  dictionary.wordidf ie the words number of occurrences in the document multiplied by the tag weighting for this particular words tag, divided my the maximum term frequency for that document. Then that multiplied by the words inverse document frequency to give you the final score for that word, in that context.p  pThe similarity is done via cosine similarity, best show in the image below. a hrefhttpi.imgur.comn3Bp8.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comn3Bp8.jpga p  pSo each page has its similarity to the BaseID, and the system shows the user all the page IDs, URLs and Titles, ordered by similarity from most to least similar.p  pExplanation of the problem Currently massive amounts of data is dragged out of MySQL and handed over to PHP which then does all the processing.p  pThis is because I only know my way around basic MySQL. I know it is possible to use functions and procedures, but I am getting mighty tangled.p  pWhat I would like to have is for me to pass a BaseID to MySQL and it return the page IDs, URLs and Titles, ordered by similarity from most to least similar.p  pI know this is a massive question, and nobodys getting paid to sit here and churn out solutions. So I really appreciate that youve even read this far downp

Negative 73042 pIve built an online community in Drupal with a homepage that is kind of like the Facebook wall. You see the 25 most recent posts, with the two most recent comments below those posts. There is also a textarea right below those comments so that you can quickly post a new comment on a particular post.p  pThese Facebookstyle posts have a lot of functionality built into them via JavaScript. Clicking a view all comments link directly below a post makes an AJAX call that grabs all the comments for that post and displays them right below it. You can also mark posts as helpful, as the solution to your question, edit comments inline, etc. All of these actions require AJAX requests, which means that the JavaScript making the request needs to know essential information such as the Node ID the unique identifier of the post, the comment ID unique identifier of the comment, etc.p  pMy initial implementation had these pieces of essential data sprinkled all over the posts, making it more complicated to write the JS that needed to find it. So my second implementation simply output all this data into a JSONcompatible string in the main wrapping element of each post. While this made it much easier for the JS to find the data it needed, writing JSON as a string is a pain escaping quotes, no line breaks.p  pSo now I have a third idea, and Im looking for feedback on it prior to implementation. The idea is to create a single global JS Array for all these posts that contains within it objects that hold the data for each post. Each element in that array would hold the necessary data needed for the AJAX calls.

Basically, Im taking a custom resizable array class, and thats being inherited by a different array class that lacks the ability to be resized.   Anyway, I have two equality operators, one for dealing with arrays of the same size, and one for dealing with arrays of different sizes, so long as the type is the same.p  pHeres the code for the operatorsp  precode operator   template lttypename T, sizet Ngt const FixedArray ltT, Ngt amp FixedArray ltT, Ngtoperator  const FixedArray ltT, Ngt amp rhs      forsizet x  0 x lt N x              thisgtsetx, rhs[x]          return this     operator   template lttypename T, sizet Ngt template ltsizet Mgt const FixedArray ltT, Ngt amp FixedArray ltT, Ngtoperator  const FixedArray ltT, Mgt amp rhs      thisgtresizeM     forsizet x  0 x lt M x              thisgtsetx, rhs[x]          return this  codepre  pAnd heres what Im using to create and assignp  precode    FixedArrayltchar, 10gt  fa1  new FixedArrayltchar, 10gt     FixedArrayltchar, 20gt  fa2  new FixedArrayltchar, 20gt fa1  fa1 works fa1  fa2 causes compiler to freak out codepre  pThe error message basically is saying that I cant do this with 10 and 20 its not picking up my second assignment operator with the template .p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 73042 pI designed a database using MySQLWorkbench EER model with many foreign key relationships and tables using Django default naming conventions like using codeidcode for primary keys, codeidcode for foreign keys. Now that I feel that I have a good backend design, how do I emconvertem that into a Django Python code for codemodels.pycode Do I have to manually type out every tablep  pI read that there is already a a hrefhttpcode.google.compumltodjango relnofollowUML to Djangoa conversation and I also know MySQLWorkbench can export and Forward Engineer SQL CREATE script. But Im not sure if MySQLWorkbench can export a UML diagram.p  pAlso another question, I have an codeordercode table that has 3 foreign keys to the codeusercode table. The three foreign keys are codeusercreatedcode, codeusermodifiedcode, and codeuserstatuscode. I know that normally Django would create a foreign key called codeuseridcode, but what if I need three strongdistinctstrong foreign key from one tablep
Negative 73042 pI am completely lost in C as I have never used it before.

Negative 73042 pI would like to implement perdirectory quotas for a multiuser web application were developing.

I create virtual volumes which I assign to my clients so they can store their private data and, in case they need more, they can pay on a perstorageammount basis.p  pThe problem I see with this is I just see 8 loop devices in my dev hierarchy, and we currently have 17 test clients for our application, so the ammount of currently present loop devices dont cover my needs.

Negative 73042 pIm trying to create a generic, reusable view, that looks like a lined notepad.

Something needs to coordinate these changes...p  pNow, one approach I thought of taking was to use a MVC design pattern. A view controller could handle all events and move the subviews around accordingly.  This MVC could then be embedded in other MVCs.p  pNormally when using a MVC design pattern, a controller would handle user events and manipulate the model and view.  However, my custom view doesnt have a model  all Im trying to do is have the view manage its own subviews when a user does something like scroll.  It seems to me that the MVC design pattern isnt a good fit here for two reasonsp  ol liThere isnt a model or logic that is specific to the program its being used in.li liIt seems to me that the view should be responsible for handling user events that change how the view should appear.li ol  p... but I could be wrong, which is why Im asking for help.

Negative 73042 pUPDATE I have boiled the problem down to two methods starting with a parameter of the same name. I have submitted a bug to CXF with demo code here a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseCXF4201 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseCXF4201ap  pI am trying to develop a simple web service with spring and Apache CXF 2.5.2. My first attempt was to start from Java and generate a WSDL from that. However, I was unable to get array parameters of complex types to work see also my other SO question.p  pNow I tried to take the WSDL generated from that, and use it as a starting point. I generate a service with the maven cxf wsdl2java plugin, and also a client for testing the one that calls every method once with parameter values like null or 0  so far they only have the default implementations.p  pI have essentially the spring config from an example on the cxf homepagep  precodeltimport resourceclasspathMETAINFcxfcxf.xml gt ltimport resourceclasspathMETAINFcxfcxfservlet.xml gt  ltjaxwsendpoint    idmyService    implementorbla.blubb.myServiceImpl    implementorClassbla.blubb.myServiceImpl    addressmyservice gt codepre  pNow a lot more stuff seems to work, but I have found that one of the methods disturbs the others. If I comment that out in the interface class, all the other method calls work fine I kept the same WSDL, but jetty only complains that it cant find an implementation for the other methods, so they wont be available. If I remove the comments, suddenly some other methods start failing with an error message like p  precodeWARNING Interceptor for myserviceservicemyserviceweirdmethod has thrown exception, unwinding now org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault Message part httpmyservicesomeparam was not recognized.  Does it exist in service WSDL codepre  pAnd that is even though the evil method is not even being called from the client. p  pI looked into it and it seems the evil method is the only one that has a return type that contains an array of objects of another type rather than an array of Strings or other normal stuff. Since I had those problems with arrays before, I suspected that might be causing a problem. But then I tried commenting out all other methods in the interface except for the evil method. Now the evil method works.p  pI dont understand WSDLs very well, but it actually looks OK to me. The definition of the return type of the evil method contains a line p  precodeltxselement maxOccursunbounded minOccurs0 namethings typetnsthinggt codepre  pand thing is also defined as a type elsewhere.p  pUnfortunately I can not post the full WSDL as it is a client project.p  pThanks for any pointers, I am really running out of ideas.p

Negative 73042 pIm currently developing a camera application for Android on which some problems have occurred. I need it to work on all Android devices and since all of these works in different ways specially with the camera hardware, Im having a hard time finding a solution that works for every device.p  pMy application main goal is to launch the camera on a button click, take a photo and upload it to a server. So I dont really need the functionality of saving the image on the device, but if thats needed for further image use I might as well allow it.p  pFor example Im testing my application on a Samsung Galaxy SII and a Motorola Pad. I got working code that launches the camera, which is by the way C code since Im using Monodroidp  precodeIntent cameraIntent  new IntentAndroid.Provider.MediaStore.ActionImageCapture   StartActivityForResultcameraIntent, PHOTOCAPTURE codepre  pAnd I fetch the result, similar to this guide I followed a hrefhttpkevinpotgieter.wordpress.com20110330nullintentpassedbackonsamsunggalaxytab relnofollowhttpkevinpotgieter.wordpress.com20110330nullintentpassedbackonsamsunggalaxytaba Why I followed this guide is because the activity returns null on my galaxy device Another device oriented problem.p  pThis code works fine on the Galaxy device. It takes a photo and saves the photo in the gallery from which i can upload to a server. By further research this is apparently galaxy standard behaviour, so this doesnt work on my Motorola pad. The camera works fine, but no image is saved to gallery.p  pSo with this background my question is, am I on the right path here Do I need to save the image to gallery in order for further use in my application Is there any solution that works for every Android device, cause thats the solution i need.p  pThanks for any feedback p

Negative 73042 pI had two separate stored procedures each with their own column description and info. Now that i combined them both information of the stored procedures are displayed but with the column description of my first select statement stored procedure. Is it possible in any way that i could distinguish between the two statements The reason is because i am using a report page to display information but because i cannot have two datasets in one list, i thought i could combine all the information into one dataset and then distinguish between the information to show in different tables but within the same listdataset. p

Negative 73042 pShould helper functions which are only used within the implementation file be excluded from header file declarations p  pBy helper function I mean a convenience function that is closely associated with a class, but doesnt represent an operation on the class, does not need access to member variables, and as such is not a method.p  pOn one hand, including them in the header file makes the header file a comprehensive reference for the corresponding c implementation. On the other hand, it introduces one more piece of code to maintain for consistency. More importantly, including helper functions encourages minor violations of a layer of abstraction, in the sense that the function isnt meant to be run in other contexts, although not in a severe way since theres not a risk of corrupting class state so long as the helper function itself is not breaking encapsulation of classes it works with.p

From the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidnetwifiWifiManager.MulticastLock.html relnofollowdocumentationap  blockquote   pClass Overviewp      pAllows an application to receive Wifi Multicast packets. Normally the Wifi stack filters out packets not explicitly addressed to this device. Acquring a MulticastLock will cause the stack to receive packets addressed to multicast addresses. Processing these extra packets can cause a noticable battery drain and should be disabled when not needed.p blockquote  p802.11 Probe Request frames, which are sent out by clients looking for wireless networks in range, generally use the broadcast MAC address as the destination.  Does this imply that an Android app that has acquired a multicast lock is capable of receiving these Probe Requests, or is my understanding of the codeMulticastLockcode misguided  I suspect the term emmulticastem may be in reference to Layer 3, as opposed to Layer 2 embroadcastem, but because the class overview states emAllows an application to receive strongWifistrong Multicast packetsem, Im a little uncertain and would like some clarification.p

Negative 73042 pI have a site that I enter a usernamepassword and click a login button.  The login button makes an XMLHttpRequest object, and fires it off.  p  pOn Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Android devices, iOS devices this works fine. IE9 will work fin so long as I am on an HTTP address and not using HTTPS.p  pOn HTTPS, IE9 behaves as followsp  pThe first login request never returns anything back.  The F12 screen does show my login request in the network tab and all looks correct. The scripting tab never throws an error.  Simply nothing happens.p  pHeres the crazy part   If I click login a second time, it actually works.   If I click refresh on the browser, and then login, that will work as wellp  pI am making the request as followsp  precode   var x  new XMLHttpRequest    x.openPOST, RelativeURLPath, true    x.setRequestHeaderContentType, textplain    x.onreadystatechange  function         if x.readyState  4 ampamp x.status  200               handle callback               x.sendmy request codepre  pWhen this fails, the debugger will go from the x.send line into the onreadystatechange code.  The readyState will be 1.  This will be the last I can debug because nothing else happens.p  pAny ideas would be extremely appreciated.p  p[EDIT] I let one request go to see what would happen.  The onreadystatechange event fired again with readyState  4 and status  12152.  The network view in IE9s F12 screen shows the result as Aborted and the time taken as 1589.07s.  A Google search shows this means the connection was closed on the server.p  p[EDIT 2] Based on a comment below I redid this code to just use jQuerys ajax method.  I thought this might have a chance at eliminating bad code on my part.  No such luck.  The same behavior occurs. p  precode   .ajax       url sUrl,       success function data, textStatus, x           workerCallbackdata, id,        ,       error function x, testStatus, errorThrown           workerCallbacknc, id, errorThrown       ,       contentType textplain,       data JSON.stringifyreq,       dataType json,       timeout 1600000,       type POST     codepre  p[FINAL UPDATE] Ive updated the code.  If a timeout occurs, I simply repost the same request  one time only.  Quite the hack but it works.  Unless anyone finds the solution Ill split the bounty between a few helpful ideas people have had below.p

For instance, did [What  0, 1, 2, 3] happen to [Who  0, 1, 2, 3] between [When  20121001 to 20121101].p  pIm looking for advice on how best to index this table. Im fairly sure a composite index is the way to go, but Im unsure of the exact configuration. For instance, what should the column order be Ive read that the most selective columns should go to the left, which I think in this case would be [When], [Who], [What]. Is this correctp  pSorry if this question seems vague, but Id be grateful for any input. Im using SQL Server 2012.p
Negative 73042 pI have a class variable codemysetcode which is a set, and into which I am adding stringsp  pcodeMyClass.myset.addself.somestringpropertycodep  pMy problem is that the instance of the class that runs the above may get garbage collected at any time, and when that happens I think I lose its codesomestringpropertycode in codemysetcode class variable.p  pIn order to preserve codesomestringpropertycode in codemysetcode for each instance, I need to create a copy of it and store emthat copyem into codemysetcode.

Negative 73042 pSo I have an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIterativeclosestpoint relnofollowiterative closest pointa ICP algorithm that has been written and will fit a model to a point cloud. As a quick tutorial for those not in the know ICP is a simple algorithm that fits points to a model ultimately providing a homogeneous transform matrix between the model and points. p  pHere is a quick picture tutorial.p  pStep 1. Find the closest point in the model set to your data setp  pStep 2 Using a bunch of fun maths sometimes based on gradiant descent or SVD pull the clouds closer together and repeat untill a pose is formedp  p[Figure 2][2]p  pNow that bit is simple and working, what i would like help with is  strongHow do I tell if the pose that I have is a good onestrongp  pSo currently I have two ideas, but they are kind of hackyp  ol lipHow many points are in the ICP Algorithm. Ie, if I am fitting to almost no points, I assume that the pose will be badp  pBut what if the pose is actually good It could be, even with few points. I dont want to reject good poses. In fact from experimentation , with a good seed few points is actually better, but if the seed is bad then it is no goodpli ol  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHXR2x.jpg altFigure 5p  pSo what we see here is that low points can actually make a very good position if they are in the right place. p  pSo the other metric investigated was the ratio of the supplied points to the used points. Heres an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGsdpv.jpg altFigure 6p  pNow we exlude points that are too far away because they will be outliers, now this means we need a good starting position for the ICP to work, but i am ok with that. Now in the above example the assurance will say NO, this is a bad pose, and it would be right because the ratio of points vs points included isp  precode211 lt SOMETHRESHOLD codepre  pSo thats good, but it will fail in the case shown above where the triangle is upside down. It will say that the upside down triangle is good because all of the points are used by ICP. p  pYou strongdontstrong need to be an expert on ICP to answer this question, i am looking for good ideas. Using knowledge of the points how can we classify whether it is a good pose solution or not p  pUsing both of these solutions together in tandem is a good suggestion but its a pretty lame solution if you ask me, very dumb to just threshold it.p  pWhat are some good ideas for how to do thisp  pPS. If you want to add some code, please go for it. I am working in c.p  pPPS. Someone help me with tagging this question I am not sure where it should fall.p

This is what I want to speed up.p  precodepackage example  import java.awt.datatransfer. import java.util. import javax.swing. import javax.swing.tree.  public class Example       private JScrollPane getContent          ArrayListltStringgt arrayList  new ArrayListltStringgt         for int i  0 i lt 3000 i               arrayList.add String.format Node d, i                    DefaultMutableTreeNode root  new DefaultMutableTreeNode Root          for String s  arrayList               root.add new DefaultMutableTreeNode s                    JTree tree  new JTree root          tree.setDragEnabled true          tree.setDropMode DropMode.ONORINSERT          tree.setTransferHandler new TreeTransferHandler          tree.getSelectionModel.setSelectionMode TreeSelectionModel.CONTIGUOUSTREESELECTION          expandTree tree          return new JScrollPane tree            private void expandTree JTree tree           DefaultMutableTreeNode root  DefaultMutableTreeNodetree.getModel.getRoot         Enumeration e  root.breadthFirstEnumeration         while e.hasMoreElements               DefaultMutableTreeNode node  DefaultMutableTreeNodee.nextElement             if node.isLeaf                   continue                          int row  tree.getRowForPath new TreePath node.getPath               tree.expandRow row                     public static void main String[] args           JFrame f  new JFrame         f.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXITONCLOSE          f.add new Example.getContent          f.setSize 400, 400          f.setLocation 200, 200          f.setVisible true         class TreeTransferHandler extends TransferHandler       DataFlavor nodesFlavor     DataFlavor[] flavors  new DataFlavor[1]     DefaultMutableTreeNode[] nodesToRemove      public TreeTransferHandler          try              String mimeType  DataFlavor.javaJVMLocalObjectMimeType                      class                      javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode[].class.getName                                   nodesFlavor  new DataFlavor mimeType              flavors[0]  nodesFlavor          catch ClassNotFoundException e               System.out.println ClassNotFound   e.getMessage                     public boolean canImport TransferHandler.TransferSupport support           if support.isDrop               return false                  support.setShowDropLocation true          if support.isDataFlavorSupported nodesFlavor                return false                   Do not allow a drop on the drag source selections.

Negative 73042 pWhen I change the time zone on my computer when testing on the simulator or on the phone when testing directly on the phone, codeDateTime.ToLocalTimecode does not return updated results.p  pI register and successfully receive notification events for codeUIApplication.Notifications.ObserveSignificantTimeChangecode.

This object is reset only when the difference between codeDateTime.GetNowcode and codeTimeZone.timezonecheckcode.

Negative 73042 pIm building a card game in JavaScript in order to increase my web programming chops, and Im having an issue with JavaScript Prototype inheritance. My design has a base Card class that contains all of the function and data any card will ever need. The design itself is relatively flexible, so just by changing the data stored about 25 of cards can use the base class. What I need to do is create new classes that inherits everything from Card  including the data  but overrides a small subset of the available functions without touching the base class functions. p  pIve been attempting to use prototype inheritance to accomplish this, but this changes the base class, which not only screws up any cards using the Card class, but also every other function that inherits from the base class.p  pWhat I need is a design pattern that allows me to override a function ONLY for the classes inheriting from Card. Is this possible in JavaScriptp  pEdit...p  pSorry, heres an example, probally should have added this in the first place.p  pStarting with the Base Card class.p  precodefunction Card     this.cardID  0     this.name       this.imageID  0     this.imageURL       this.imageAlt       etc....

I had not thought about it at all in this case, but when he asked I remembered the video saying In C11 you should generally use pass by value.p  pMy question is thus In the code below, would codestdpairltHostName, IPAddressgt pcode be better off like codestdpairltHostName, IPAddressgtamp pcode or not Will move semantics be used and would it make a differencep  precodeIPAddress NameServerlookup const HostNameamp host  const      auto it  stdfindif vec.begin, vec.end,                        [host]  stdpairltHostName, IPAddressgt p           return p.first  host           ...  codepre
Negative 73042 pIn my Web.API project, for development in the web settings I use the Project Url of codehttplocalhostreportercode on my local IIS web server.  There are pages that are served up from this site using asp.net mvc4 with javascript calls that post to urls like apigetdata. p  pFor some reason, these have stopped working for example, I would make a jQuery post to apigetdata and the full URL was codehttplocalhostreporterapigetdatacode which was correct.  And life was good.p  pBut now something has changed same jQuery post, nothing else in code different that Im aware of, but my full URLs are now codehttplocalhostapigetdatacode  I lost that reporter part.

Negative 73042 pstrongBackgroundstrong Our school entered in a competition where my team based on 3 people including me is assigned the task to do navigation and image processing. Its an year long project but I want to get started as soon as possible and see what are the options I have. University and other firms are funding in this research as well. I am no computer science major, we are building an engineering application that highly depends on navigation and image processing for basis of intense calculation purposes on top.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I understand we will be needing algorithms and smart data structure choices to cut down the processes and split the work in threads to harness the power of the device. Anyhow, I have been reading a lot regarding OpenCL implementations for Java that I found namely, LWJGL, JOCL, JavaCL. The problem is, they all do the same thing but some does it better in their own unique ways. I am looking for something simple with fair amount of community and crossplatform support. Because, the microcontrollers we will buy most probably run Linux I am thinking Arduino and SMARTGPU. p  pAnyways, this is very early so I need some pointers as to where to go from here. I will probably need to look up some guides, tutorials, and manuals as well to understand more on OpenCL.p

Negative 73042 pI asked a question previously but I realized its too confusing.  Basically I need to come up with a way to write a selector that behaves like the followingp  pfor each element in this  container, search to see if that element has a class of apple OR banana OR cranberry OR dragonfruit.  If it does then append this .style class to THAT element.p  pThe twist is, all the classes that Im checking for are dynamic.  I need a flexible way to insert different classes to search for in the selector.p  precodeFor example Lets say I have one selector that reads For each element in ltdivgt, does element have banana OR dragonfruit.  But another selector would be different For each element in ltdivgt, does element have cranberry. codepre  pSee so basically I need a dynamic selector that not only changes what it searches for, but also changes the length of the search list.  Some searches only need one filter, some need multiple.p  pTLDR Is there a way to writep  pcode.divContainer.hasClassx or y or z or w or....code  where x, y, z, w.... are different class names that are generated dynamically.  How can I do this  I was thinking of using function calls in place of x, y, z.... basically using functions inside the .hasClass argumentsp

The data is imported from Excel, cleaned up, corrected, and tested against a variety of validation checks.   Access then uses ADO to write the data to a table on the Oracle server, and then invoke a PLSQL procedure to process it.p  pThe procedure performs a number of validation checks some are duplicate, some are specific to the DB.  When passed, it reads in each record  interprets it  and populates the normalized tables in the database.p  pConsidering the amount of validation checks already at play in Access, I am really not expecting any errors to be raised from the Oracle Procedure  but if there is, Id like the error to be passed back to Access and displayed to the user.p  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrongp  pI have searched on this forum, and Google.  From what I read  raiseapplicationerror returns output to the calling client  but given that there is an OLE DB Provider and the ADO DB API between Oracle and Access, I am guessing that the error is being encapsulated and a simple PassFail is being returned from the Execute callp  precodeoraConn.Execute importdata oraErrText   Set oraErrors  oraConn.Errors  For Each oraError In oraErrors   debug.print oraError.Number   debug.print oraError.Description   debug.print oraError.Source   debug.print oraError.SQLState    debug.print oraError.NativeError Next codepre  pThe above results in a single error   strongORA00900 invalid SQL statementstrongp

Negative 73042 pI am trying to find out if it is possible to develop dynamic asynchronous forms and web pages without using any form of clientside programming or scripting. So basicaly Im trying to have the benefits of AJAX and DOM manipulation without using Javascript at all. If possible Id like to have all the programming done server side in Python or a similar language. Im trying really hard to circumvent using Javascript in web development. I just dont want to get into it or remotely touch it with a stick.p  pI came across AHAH Asynchronous HTML and HTTP and it seems interesting. However I was reading that the XHTML retrieved cannot be on local on your file system. Apparently, you must FTP your HTML document onto a Web site. And the HTML documents that you are fetching must also reside on a Web site. source a hrefhttpwww.xfront.commicroformatsAHAH.html relnofollowhttpwww.xfront.commicroformatsAHAH.htmla Anyone tried this and can confirm this I find that not very practical. It would make more sense to host everything in the same file system on the same server.p  pAlso a disadvantage of AHAH is that it seems to not be able to manipulate the DOM, meaning it is somewhat restricted to what it can do. Your placeholder have to already be there in your web page and then you can retrieve XHTML fragment to fill these placeholder.p  pDoes anyone know of some ways to have dynamic asynchronous web pages and also manipulate the DOM without using Javascript Im okay with anything serverside since I can pretty much use any language that I want. Worst case scenario I guess I could have a nice interactive web site without having to manipulate the DOM, but I think modern web sites have to be asynchronous. It is kind of a deal breaker for me, having to reload a page for every slight changes.p

Negative 73042 pWe would like to be able to set up iOS devices in such a way that users are not allowed to install new apps but are allowed to upgrade existing apps. Ideally this would be implemented as an MDM profile. Ive looked at allowAppInstallation, but according to the documentation, this disables both installation and upgrade. These devices will all be assigned a common Apple ID account, and users will not in general have access to the password for this account. This gets us close to what we want. The user will be prompted for a password on new installations but not on upgrades to free apps. We need to be able to lock to devices to the assigned Apple ID, though. Ive seen some references indicating that theres a way to do this, but havent found the appropriate setting or MDM key.p

Negative 73042 pI want to copy an entire TFS project to another project, e.g. MyProj to MyProjSev. Then I want to rollback MyProjSev to a changeset that corresponds to when the client stopped paying.  Then I will make MyProjSev available, including the history of the source files, to the client for a period of time as part of the severance agreement.  The accesssecurity aspect I know.  I can easily make a branch, but if the client views the branch from a TFS Explorer Client, then the history is not available.  There are a couple of approaches that involve cloning the entire collection, and lacking an answer to this question here, I will use one of them.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4918289553593httpstackoverflow.coma4918289553593a  [TFS admin detach the collection, back up SQL Server database, TFS admin attach collection, SQL Server restore database to new database name, then TFS admin attach the restored collection]p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee349263vvs.100.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee349263vvs.100.aspxa [Collection command with clone]p  pstrongNew Informationstrong  a hrefhttpvisualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.comeb77e739c98c4e369eadfa115b27fefe relnofollowhttpvisualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.comeb77e739c98c4e369eadfa115b27fefea TFS Integration Tools was what finally worked for me.  This 2012 release is a very nice product. It was easy to do a TFS to TFS transfer from my MyProj to the new MyProjSev that I created for client to access. Upon completion I simply did some rollbacks and set the security in the new project. It would have been easier if in TFS 2010 one can rename projects can do in TFS 2012 Neither the TFSConfig Collection clone nor the procedure described in MS Docs for Splitting a Team Projects Collection will work for this task. The issue is that even though one ends up with two collections, their projects have the same names, and that is not allowed and in TFS 2010 you cannot rename projects. p

Negative 73042 pIm having a hard time deciding on multi table inheritance vs an abstract base model.  Lets say I have a Django project with a load of models, say...p  pVideo, Document, Picture, and a load more.p  pThey will share some common fields and pieces of functionality.  Eg, I might want to show a list of the latest 20 items mixed of all types, and a user can rate or tag any of these content types, or a user can have their own list which will include multiple content types.p  pSomething like thisp  precodeBaseItem      added      updated      tags      ratings  VideoBaseItem  DocumentBaseItem  PersonBaseItem codepre  pIm wondering if this is a good case for using multi table inheritance or if I should simply use an abstract base class.p  p1  Use Multi Table Inheritence.p  pThus would mean I could easily query and display the latest 20 items across all types. I could use something like the InheritenceManager from djangomodelutils to get the correct types when needed. Id no doubt need to be careful with using selectrelated and keeping an eye on my query count when retrieving items.p  p2  Use an abstract base class.p  pThis seems as though it would be more simple in knowing exactly whats going on, and that it would save JOINs against a very large table when just querying a single content type, but I guess I wouldnt be able to combine the types at database level and so would need to do so in Python which feels like a fudge. Id also need my Tag model to use a GFK to multiple types rather than an FK to just the BaseItem.p  pMulti table inheritance feels like it should be right from some sort of purity standpoint, but Ive seen people recommend that its avoided where possible. In my case I feel as though Im not sure the extra JOINs and potential ability for someone to shoot themselves in the foot by missing a selectrelated call would be worth it, and I also feel as though Im not super clear on where this might cause problems in the future.p  pAny thoughts on which way would be a better choice and why, or anywhere I could find some more discussion around the trade offsp  pThanksp

For instance, if two gene sequence tokens have a Levenshtein Edit Distance that is lt a specified threshold of 5, 10, 25 etc... I would like to assign them to the same bucket  category.  However, I cannot use edit distance since the token categories are not known in advance and the calculation is rather overhead intensive.  I need a very efficient locality preserving hash function or alternative solution which will allow me to determine a bucket closest to the hash value based on the threshold or create a new bucket when a close enough bucket does not exist. So far, I have not even been able one locality preserving hashing function implementation in C, only publications.  I figured I would ask before attempting to write my own.       p

Negative 73042 pI have an application that sends data gathered from a data source on my PC say, Excel or Access to a receiving app on an Android tablet. I am in the testing stage of compressing the data before it is sent and then decompressing it after it is received. Im using GZIP for this, with DotNetZip on the C side and the builtin GZIPInputStream class on the Java side.p  pIm having issues getting it to work properly. When I do a test just on one side compressing and decompressing to see if the data remains intact, everything is fine. It works on both C and Java. But when I get to the point of the data being sent over and received, I run into this issue unknown format magic number ef1f. Ive seen other SO posts where this has been discussed but the answers dont seem to help.p  pHere is the code I am using to compress on the C sidep  precodepublic void compressData      byte[] buffer  Ionic.Zlib.GZipStream.CompressBufferthis.RawStreamData.ToArray     this.RawStreamData  new MemoryStreambuffer  codepre  pAnd here is the code I am using to decompress on the Java side.

I already know the way I am reconstructing the message from the resulting decompressed buffer is wrong from testing on the Java side only, but that is a problem I need to reach first  Any help would be appreciated. I suspect it might have something to do with the compression level settings in C I am using the default, but AFAIK there is no such setting on the Java side. The BufferedReader is created with an ASCII encoding.p

I already searched about this but, there is no good explanation about it.p  pSo for the first one, how to calculate mean square error I know this is silly, but I really dont get itp  psecond When Neural Network do its training , we inputted a Training Set which consists of many pairsInput and its desired output. Now when should we calculate the mean square error does it when we already take all pairs or does we calculate it for each pairp  pif it is for each pair, then there is possibility when the error reaches the minimum desired error before all pairs inside Training set taken.p  pthird does epoch value increase for one loop of training set or does it increase when each pairsinput and desired output takenI know this is another silliness but please bear with itp  pthank you very muchp

I have two csv files, one with school data that looks like this emid, name, longitude, latitudeemp  pThe other csv has network datap  pemidem, emnetIdem this is other school ids that are connected, emhitsem this is basically how many connections are between the two schoolsp  pI have the school data bound to circles on a map. What Im trying to do is on a click, find each of the connected schools and transition their circles on the map based on how many connections they have. p  pIm assuming this is going to need to be a series of for loops, but Im not sure of the best way to do it.  Currently, skipping past all the map creation stuff, I have thisp  precode    var currData  []   d3.csvnetwork.csv, functionnetworkData     d3.csvschoolData.csv, functiondata                create the circles               var circle  svg.selectAllcircle      bind the data                     .datadata                     .enter                     .appendcircle                     .attrcx, functiond                          return projection[d.lon, d.lat][0]                                          .attrcy, functiond                          return projection[d.lon, d.lat][1]                                       initial style of circles will move this into a class eventually                     .attrr, 5                     .stylefill, orange                     .styleopacity, 0.75                on click                      .onclick, function d                for i  0 ilt networkData.length i                      ifd.id  networkData[i].id                        currData.pushnetId networkData[i].netId,                                     hits networkData[i].hits                                               codepre  pThis is returning the netId and hits if I log it to the console within the for loop, but I cant seem to access currData outside of the for loop. Im not sure why.  I am also not sure of the best way to take each of the subsequent netIds and link them back to the school data bound to the circle elements. Am I making this more complicated than necessary Does D3 have an easy way of doing thisp  pWhen a circle is clicked on the map, I need to find the id of schools in the network for the selected school and then make a change to their circles on the map based on the number of hits.

Negative 73042 pI am trying to run a query against a 3rd party employee time tracking database. As far as I can tell, they do not keep a running total on an employees time throughout the day.

Negative 73042 pI have a singleton object that implements some basic functionality in a common library.

The library isnt installed on the machine where the code runs.  The contents of the common library is included within each JAR when the artifacts are created in IntelliJ IDEA.p  pBoth projects JAR files load and run as plugins inside a parent application, so theyre both loaded inside the same JVM.  I expected each JAR to have its own copy of this common singleton, since they are, after all, separate JAR files.  It is only included in a common library because many of my projects require the same functionality and I would rather include the library in my project than have multiple copies of the code floating around.p  h1ProjectModule 1  TestPluginOne.JARh1  precodepackage mystuff.plugins.TestPluginOne  import mystuff.lib.common.CommonSingleton import mystuff.lib.common.Objects.Cache  public class TestClassOne       public TestClassOne            public Boolean SaveItemInCacheString key, String content          return CommonSingleton.INSTANCE.getCache.addkey, content, 30           public void Reload          CommonSingleton.INSTANCE.Reload        codepre  h1ProjectModule 2  TestPluginTwo.JARh1  precodepackage mystuff.plugins.TestPluginTwo  import mystuff.lib.common.CommonSingleton import mystuff.lib.common.Objects.Cache  public class TestClassTwo       public TestClassTwo            public String GetItemFromCacheString key          return CommonSingleton.INSTANCE.getCache.getkey           public void Reload          CommonSingleton.INSTANCE.Reload        codepre  pI am finding, however, that when I use this object in both of my modules separate JAR files, mind you, that they are both accessing the same singleton.  While this particular example with a Cache object, might not indicate any issue with this, there are many reasons why I need these treated as separate objects.  There are many internalprivate member variables that need to contain different values, depending on the projectmoduleplugin that is consuming this Singleton.p  pIm confused.  When I do this in .NET for example in separate DLLs, each DLL maintains its own internal instance of that common object.p  pHow can I have this common Singleton functionality included in separate projects, from a common library, without them sharing instances of the Singleton objectp  pThanksp

Yet, is there a way to write shaders or enable a bunch of options so that only genuine 2d coordinates are usedin hard memory I know one could embed two 2x2 matrices in a 4x4 matrix, but the codeglPositioncode variable being a codevec4code seems to end the track here.

Negative 73042 pI am working in python. my problem is I have several strings and I have to detect which part of them look like a path and then normalize the ones that are actual paths. bre.g. I have several different strings like follows  br1. ......Workspace br2. CsourceWorkspace br3. B....source br4. build....worksource..workspace br5. HDabcbdsWorkspace brBasically some strings are paths straightaway and some have a trailing  attached to them. The length of option string is variable. brIn the above example strings 3, 4, 5 contain a path string preattached with an option B, build, H respectively. br The problem is how to detect from the above examples, which part of the string is a path and which is not. The options are not fixed so I cant just check given strings head for prespecified options. br The only way to go forward is taking the substring starting from .. or one character before  e.g. C or D. BRBRSo the question is that is there any generalized way of doing this or does python provide any function to take truncated portion of a string starting  from any particular position  brbrany answer which satisfies above 5 examples is cool even though it is kinda overfitting.p  pThe code that I am currently using for e.g. 2 and 5 is  codepath  path[path.find1]code and for others its codepath  path[path.find.]code.

Im not sure why this would occur since I am fairly new to pthreads. p  pIt seems like sometimes it works perfectly fine and other times and other times, the value of i becomes so large that it causes the program to either abort or presents a segmentation fault.p

Negative 73042 pI am developing app which can give user ability to open picture in ImageView  and then draw lines on it and also erase them. But i have one big problem when i am loading a big image the drawing  process becomes very slow. But when the image is small then drawing process is normal. p  pThis is an algorithm what i do to draw lines 1. Open image from SD card decode image size and rescale it if necessary. 2. Put Bitmap into ImageView by setImageBitmapbitmap method 3. Create transparent bitmap with width and height as the original bitmap has to draw and erase lines on it. 4. Draw or erase lines on transparent bitmap using Path class in ImageView onDraw methodp  pThis is my onDraw method p  precodeOverride protected void onDrawCanvas canvas      super.setImageMatrixmMatrix     super.onDrawcanvas     if mFragmentImage.inDrawMode return     canvas.save     if mFragmentImage.mShapenull         if mFragmentImage.mShape.getType  CustomShape.SHAPELINE              mOverlayCanvas.drawPathmFragmentImage.mShape.getPath, mFragmentImage.mShape.getPaint                   if mOverlaynull    canvas.drawBitmapmOverlay, mMatrix, null     canvas.restore  codepre  pCan anyone give some advices how to make drawing process faster.p

Negative 73042 pI need to calculate a static average value of all rows in a Table to compare individual row values against.

Is there anyway within this query that I could obtain a static average of all of the rows codeITEMPRICEcodes to compare the individual codeITEMPRICEcode for each row against I think the problem may be in the way the codeGROUP BYcode correlates the values, but Im not sure.p
Negative 73042 pIm trying to interface OpenMP with another language that emits C code a C code generator. From my perspective Im not the designer of the other language, it will be easiest to do this by calling a C function or functionlike macro instead of using pragma or Pragma directly. I do not have much experience with the C preprocessor, but I have gotten a simple example found on wikipedia to work in a nonsatisfactory way. Here is the original C examplep  precodeinclude ltomp.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int main int argc, char argv[]    int thid, nthreads   pragma omp parallel privatethid        thid  ompgetthreadnum     printfHello World from thread dn, thid     pragma omp barrier     if  thid  0         nthreads  ompgetnumthreads       printfThere are d threadsn,nthreads           return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pNow here is where I create a macro codepragmaompparallelprivatecode to do what I wantp  precodeinclude ltomp.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  define STRx x define STRINGIFYx STRx  define ompparpri STRINGIFYomp parallel private  char omptest[]  ompparpri define pragmaompparallelprivatethreadid           PragmaSTRINGIFYomp parallel private  threadid  int main int argc, char argv[]    int thid, nthreads     pragma omp parallel privatethid   pragmaompparallelprivatethid        thid  ompgetthreadnum     printfHello World from thread dn, thid     pragma omp barrier     if  thid  0         nthreads  ompgetnumthreads       printfThere are d threadsn,nthreads           return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pThe preprocessor will emit an error, but if I actually compile the preprocessed code, it works as expected.

Negative 73042 pThe end goal is to determine how crashy or stable a particular featuretask is.p  pIve been gathering crash reports from a crash reporting tool for a popularly used Android and iOS app. Fortunately, the crash reports include the class name and method name under which there was a crash.p  pHowever, suppose I want to now somehow map the crashes based on classmethod to a particular task or feature. I.e.   for class codeAnalytics.javacode, method codeonLogcode, i can safely map this to the analytics feature, because if i trace through the code and based on the naming, i find that this crash correlates to the code trying to log an anlytics event.p  pThe question isp  ol lihow can i do this programmatically, for all crashes is this even possible without AI li liIs there some sort of tool that i can use to generate the classes touched upon when i perform a particular taskfeature i.e. in the Android app when i tap a button to log in and then put in my email, this tool should show me all code paths touchedli liIs this an effective way to tell software stability if not, any suggestionsli ol

This behavior seems to be consistent with the first query above.  But in fact each group is an order.

Negative 73042 pIve noticed that Timers.Timer and Threading.Timer behave differently on a Console application.

Negative 73042 pI read a hrefhttpsblog.basefarm.combloghowtoinstalllogstashonwindowsserver2012withkibanainiisa blog posta about setting up Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana, and the author suggested to use NXLog to ship logs from different machines. A typical distributed scenario presented in The Logstash Book shows how Logstash can be used in both shipping and indexing role. We are currently experimenting with Logstash and setting up it to ship logs to Elasticsearch was straighforward. So I wonder why people choose NXLog as a log shipper to Logstash instead of using Logstash on both ends.p

Im using the builtin slickFilter method and then a bit of styling on the buttons to visually show that button has been selected. But as youve probably realised, creating a new Javascript function for every vendor is horribly inefficient. Is there a way for the function to know enough about what youve just clicked on for it to use the same function regardless of which one you clicked Also, the method of setting the var filtered is also a bit flawed since clicking another vendor will currently just unfilter rather than unfilter then refilter to that vendor  so the function ought to know whether the vendor button youve clicked on is already filtered and act on that.p  pSupplementary question for anyone who knows slick  is there a way to centre all the items in the slider area when there are less than the number of slidesToShowp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8vLs9qp6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net8vLs9qp6ap

Negative 73042 pIn my application, I am using Spring Security 3.2.5. I am trying to authenticate via ActiveDirectory using codeorg.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.ad.ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvidercode. I am testing a scenario that the password is wrong.p  pIn JBoss EAP 6.2, I get codejavax.naming.AuthenticationExceptioncode, this is handled in codeActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvidercode in a correct way as it was expected by Spring Security. Below shows how this exception is handled in codeActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvidercode from Spring Security 3.2.5p  precodetry          return contextFactory.createContextenv      catch NamingException e          if e instanceof AuthenticationException  e instanceof OperationNotSupportedException              handleBindExceptionbindPrincipal, e             throw badCredentialse          else              throw LdapUtils.convertLdapExceptione                   codepre  pBut when I test the same scenario with JBoss EAP 6.3, I get the codejavax.naming.NamingExceptioncode instead so the logic goes to else statement. And in codeLdapUtils.convertLdapExceptioncode method, it returns the p  precodereturn new org.springframework.ldap.UncategorizedLdapExceptionex     codepre  pand it ends up as error 500 since it is not an codeAuthenticationExceptioncode.p  pSince Spring Security 3.2.5 code uses codeinstanceofcode, and codeAuthenticationExceptioncode is the root cause in the codeNamingExceptioncode you can see this by running codee.getCausecode while debugging, so the exception is not handled neither in codeActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvidercode nor in codeLdapUtilscode.p  pI assume fixing this either in Spring Security or JBoss will take some time. I am desperately in need of a workaround solution. Since codeActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvidercode is a final class, I can not easily make a custom class based on it. Any other idea apart from extending codeAbstractLdapAuthenticationProvidercode and copy the whole thing from codeActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvidercodep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 73042 pIve got a web service which I currently connect to and Authenticate against using Basic authentication with WinInet.

Negative 73042 pI have a rather general question. I have made an app that uses a large word list. These words are stored in a text file along with the source code. On the initial launch of the app I populate a data object with words from the text file. This data object is then used for each new startup as it is persistent and the text file is never used again.p  pI find this solution to be a bit weird to be honest. Is it possible to rather prepopulateprecompile such a data object using builtin iOS functionality Im thinking along the lines of having a .sqlite file that already has all the data stored in it on the first launch, as one would do in any other language Ive worked with.p  pAll answers are welcome   p

All other processes cannot read from other sessions controlling terminal. So no one can read from the terminal, vhangup not needed.p  pPlease correct where I am wrong.p

Negative 73042 pIm making a simple mobile web app where users should be able to loginauthenticate to sign up for private events.

Data is sent to, and returned from my PHP processing script to the JQuery frontend. For handling the submit event, for some reason this code worked emdocument.readyfunctionem as opposed to an onclick thing which didnt work.p  pThis baffles me, as I read that document.ready is an event that occurs when the document has completed loading.p  pQ1 Could this have something to do with me using Jquery mobile emsectionsem   pQ2 What would be the correct JQuery eventtrigger to use prior to loading, to control form context based on data from backend PHP.p  pQ3a Is it a viable solution to rely on PHP sessions in such a case p  pQ4 Also considering that Id like to Phonegap it...will a PHP session be able to see the Jquerybased, phonegapwrapped app like a client session just like if it was someone using a webbrowser 4b.

Negative 73042 pI was not able to find an answer to a simple question like this... Id like to resize a XAML control using keyboard, like I did in Windows Forms. Example in Windows Forms when I placed a TextBox in a form, I could resize it using [SHIFT][LeftArrow] or [SHIFT][RightArrow]. In this way I was able to resize that TextBox with a high degree of precision, without using the mouse. If I do the same using XAML, the TextBox is being MOVED, not RESIZED. I tried many keyboards combinations, but I was not able to find the equivalent of [SHIFT][LeftArrow] or [SHIFT][RightArrow] for XAML controls.p  pDo you know if such a shortcut existsp  pSorry if it seems a dumb question, but Im missing this feature.p

Negative 73042 pWhat would be the best way to store daily health related data height, weight, calories burned, hours of sleep in a Parse MongoDB database   The user will update their health data up to 1015 times a day and I am unsure how to track their data in real time without having to create a new record every time they update only a certain piece of information. Currently I have a User class and a HealthProfile class, which contains basic information about height, weight, etc. p  pI could collect the data over the course of the day and then save it in the database at night however this will not work for database driven charts I want to display.p  pData Interaction will be as follows throughout the day a user inputs how much exercise they did, food they ate, etc. and the app will display a linebar chart showing their progresscalories burned or other health figures for the day, week, and month. It will also include things like blood pressure and other measurements and I want to be able to store all of these things for a user and allow them to view their history, as well as input new data, at any time. It is a similar concept to how Apples Health app works.p  pI will need to make sure the users data is always persisted in a database so if they login on their phone or the website, their data is always up to date, so writes to the database will need to be upon user input and reads will take place any time the user view a chart or figure.p

Negative 73042 pI am trying to figure out the optimum way to use maven on a CI server that has hundreds of jobs most more or less related to each other that use a lot of the same common libraries, plugins, etc.  They are all run by the same user, so by default they all share the same repo at code.m2repositorycode.  However, on a build server this is badespecially when many multimodule builds need to perform a codemvn installcode so that post build steps will work correctly, empost builds steps that may ultimately fail the build and decide not to do codemvn deploycode.em  p  pWhat I think I want is something like how eclipse works, or how mutlimodule projects work with a single reactor runyou can resolve all the dependencies without them actually being installed.  Short of that, I would like to have two sets of local repositories, one from which to resolve all deployed packages and one into which I can install the current builds artifacts such that post build steps can resolve dependencies from both giving priority to the latter.p  pAll of this said, what I am really interested in is a working solution whether it works along these lines or not, for the requirements of needing to do local installs but not wanting every job to have its own full repo due to the tremendous file system bloat that would entaila single repo could be in excess of 2GB even with all old snapshots cleaned out.p  pIt seems this would be a common problem and that a lot of busy CI servers would encounter and that there would at least one typical solution, but I cant seem to find anything.

Negative 73042 pIn my fragment, I want each custom item in my listview to look as followsp  pNamep  pSetsXRepsp  p[][][][][]  array of textviewsp  p[][][][][]  array of checkboxesp  pThe number of textviews and checkboxes depends upon the item in the adapter, so I need to create that part dynamically. I am having trouble adding these elements dynamically to my relativelayout that I partially define in my xml. Here is my fragment class followed by my xml for the custom list item. The id for the layout is listitemexerciseinworkout. I have the code to add the row of textviews, but am running into trouble adding the checkboxes. I have commented below the code that I have tried adding but is not working. The issue is coming from the second RelativeLayout.LayoutParams and how I attempt to add the second row to the view.

For example, code1,1,2,3,3,4,41,1,2,3code.li liAlternative sum set code[E,F,G,e]code as ul licode[E,F,G,e]EF,ecode, if sum all elements of multiset E is even,li licode[E,F,G,e]EG,ecode, if sum all elements of multiset E is oddli ulli ol  pFor example code[0,2,1,2,0,3,3]0,21,2,30,2,1,2,30,1,2,2,30,1,2codep  pThe problem statement is give a family of codencode nonempty natural numbers multisets codeXx0, x1, , xn1code and number codemcode and codekcode, find the sum of multiset being the result of the following operation code[[[,xi0,xj0,m],xi1,xj1,m],xik1,xjk1,m]code, i.e. applying codekcode times the alternative sum operation on the starting set codecode, for some give codelti,jgtcode pairs.p  pRight now I have solve this problem using an array representation of multisets and merging two multisets as efficient as I can merge two ordered arrays, cropping its size at the same time in codeOlcode where l is codemincode of the sizes of both arrays being merged and summing the result array at the same time.p  pBut I think there might be a faster treeheapbased solution that would allow me to merge the multisets faster and keep information about sum of the multiset in more flexible way.p  pWhat data structure would be the best choice in this casep

Negative 73042 pIs there a way to find out which anonymous Virtual Memory Areas are createdaccessed by libc p  pI have a program that codemprotectcodes VMAs on its address space. But when it codemprotectcodes an area that will be accessed by libc, a SIGSEGV occurs. Unfortunately, the signal handler that Ive installed only handles faults that occurred on my code, and not libcs.p  pIn detail, the fault I am getting is because codeprintfcode uses varargs. It tries to access the location of coderegsaveareacode which is within the codevalistcode structure. That location belongs to an anonymous VMA which I have earlier codemprotectcodeed.p  pSo, is there a to know which are these areas before I codemprotectcode them Or at least a way to know where codestdarg.hcode chooses to place coderegsaveareacodep  pThe most clean way would be to handle SIGSEGVs that occur within the libc. But I doubt that there is such a way.p  pstrongNotestrong The databss segment of libc can be easily identified because it is not anonymous. If I codemprotectcode that VMA too, it will also cause an unhandled SIGSEGV, which is why I choose not to.p

Negative 73042 pPer spec a hrefhttptools.ietf.orgiddraftthomsonhybihttptimeout01.htmlrfc.section.5 relnofollowhttptools.ietf.orgiddraftthomsonhybihttptimeout01.htmlrfc.section.5a, we can include KeepAlive headers in our request Connection KeepAlive KeepAlive timeout100 and hopefully expect a response with KeepAlive timeout15, max100 back. If there is no KeepAlive response header, Http client defaults to keeping connections longer by default, however, you can also use a custom strategy to close connections after a custom timeout as we did not get a Connection close either as discussed here a hrefhttphc.apache.orghttpcomponentsclientgatutorialhtmlconnmgmt.html relnofollowhttphc.apache.orghttpcomponentsclientgatutorialhtmlconnmgmt.htmla and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13677261howtokeephttpclientconnectionkeepaliveHow to keep HttpClient Connection KeepAlivea.p  pIn our case, the server neither returns a keepalive header nor returns a connection close meaning requests can be keptalive for some more time.p  pDoes the Http Client take care of such Connection close cases in future responses from the same reused connection that did not return any timeout header previously What happens when other side has dropped connection or timeouts on an existing keep alive connection does it re open another connection or fail on the same connection What is the best way to handle thisp  pIs there a better way to handle KeepAlive connections when DNS entries are updated I am sure Http Client can theoretically be aware of this change. This is also a very common use case because you typically use a VIPLB and they point underlying servers to different colo during releases. Again, in this case, all of the keep alive connections will fail, because the state from one colo is not replicated to another. Is there a hook like the IdleConnectionMonitor to checkp  pIs there a better way for Http Client to automatically add the request header by default KeepAlive,timeout, max20 based on socket and connection time out settings if Keep Alive is enabledp  pWe are using httpcomponents httpclient 4.3.6.p

Negative 73042 pI have an html form and d3 chart. The idea is that each checkbox in the form represents a bar on the graph. Each bars visibility is set to hidden until someone selects options from the form and the chart function reveals the bars that each checked checkbox represents.p  pHowever, I also want some bars to preload based on the forms preselected check boxes marked checked on load.p  pThe problem is that the chart only displays the bars after a checkbox has been changed.p  pIt will not show the preselected data on load. This is despite having check boxes preselected and running the exact same function that the checkboxes call when changed it works when a user makes a change but not on loadp  pWhy isnt the function

Negative 73042 pThe abstracted problem is this I have a log filep  precodeA 1 A 2 A 3 B 4 B 5 A 6 C 7 D 8 A 9 A 10 A 11 codepre  pand I want to end up with a list of lists like thisp  precode[[1, 2, 3], [6], [9, 10, 11]] codepre  pwhere the file has been broken up into runs of strings starting with codeAcode. I know that I can use codeitertools.groupbycode to solve this, and right now I have this solution where codefcode is a list of the lines in the file.p  precodestartswitha  lambda x x.startswithA coalesced  [g for , g in groupbyf, keystartswitha] runs  [re.subrA , , s for s in coalesced if startswithas] codepre  pSo I use groupby, but then I have to filter out the stuff that doesnt start with A. This is okay, and pretty terse, but is there a more elegant way to do it Id love a way thatp  ul lidoesnt require two passesli liis terser andor is more readableli ul  pHelp me harness the might of codeitertoolscodep
