Positive 1227 pI am attempting to parse some XML data and place it into a nested dictionary for later use. However as the XML data is not structured, as I understand it in a child type format or blocked data format I am not sure on the best approach. I am currently trying to use XPath and think this is the best option with this data structure but I am not sure how to parse it in a fashion that will allow me to add it to my nested dictionary correctly. I have tried the below method, but as you may have guessed its not correct. Could someone advice on the best method to parse this data p  pstrongData To Parsestrongp  precodeltaddress addr192.168.1.74 addrtypeipv4gt ltaddress addrFC751603D02A addrtypemac vendorDLink

Negative 1227 pWe have a Web project containing both an ASP.Net forms UI, and some WCF web services. This is hosted in IIS 6. Both the UI and the WCF services make use of a PDFgenerating tool which requires a license, stored in the codeltappSettingsgtcode section of the web.config file. The license is based on the domain of the website, i.e. example.com all subdomains are included in the license.p  pWhen the tools DLL is called, it does some check to see if it is indeed running in a domain for which its licensed. When the UI calls through to this tool, all works fine. When the WCF services do the same, the tool somehow gets the name of the server rather than the domain, and so thinks its unlicensed.p  pI dont really want to concentrate on the tool, what Id like to know isp  pIf code.aspxcode and code.svccode files and their parent DLL are both hosted in the same IIS 6 website and virtual directory, should they be running under an identical account  user  permission set  etc And does it matter that the WCF service implementation and contracts are in a separate DLLp

I need the da object to be instantiated at the top level base class. The concrete type UsersDAL is supplied by the concrete class UserController and the correct type should be propagated till the top level base class BusinessDataController where it should be instantiated.p  pNow while I am debugging the BusinessDataController, I can see that the type UsersDAL is being propagated, a new UsersDAL object is getting created in BusinessDataControllerBase constructor but as soon as the code is coming out of the constructor in BusinessDataControllerBase, the da member variables shows as null and hence the DoLogin process da.GetUser is giving an error object not instantiated. p  pBut, if instead of instantiating da in BusinessDataController, I create it in BusinessMasterRootData controller at Level 2, i.e. the class just above the concrete class UserController, then everything is running fine and da.GetUser works as expected.p  pI have tried to explore inheritance impacts of Generics closed construction and open construction etc. but could not find any deviations in my code. In designcompile time, I am not getting any error and getting all methods of UsersDAL with IntelliSense which possibly indicates that the type usage is correct.p  pAny idea where am I going wrong I will have multiple base classes at the third level, i.e. the BusinessMasterRootDataControllerBase level. So instantiating da at the third level will make da available in the concrete classes but will be redundant in all classes at that level and that is why I want to place it da higher up. By the way, same observation is happening if I place the constructor code at the second level i.e. BusinessRootDataControllerBase.p  pAnother information to share is I am using the UserController concrete class as a Singleton class.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 1227 pWeve got a Silverlight application with several listboxes and comboboxes that display data sorted incorrectly, which I need to fix. Most of their ItemSource properties are set through XAML. Their DataContext may not be set directly on the control, and instead were set on a parent. So I cant easily slap an OrderBy on the ItemSource or DataContext assignment in the code behind, since that assignment may not explicitly exist.p  pSo I had the idea to create a proxy collection.

Negative 1227 pI am developing a GUI frontend application in MATLAB. Its becoming quite complex these days, but as a showcase of the problem Im having, I created a simple GUI containing an axes and a button. I display a surfpeaks plot in the axes, and the buttonpress adds a colorbarlocation,southoutside to the plot. The axes stretch and overlap the boundaries I set for the object in GUIDE. Resizing them via sethandles.axes1,Position,[...] doesnt help. Any insights on how to compensate for this will be greatly appreciated.p  pAs a side note, Id like to add that maintaining an evergrowing application especially a graphicallyoriented one in MATLAB is absolutely tedious if you want the widgets to do some more complex stuff.

I can build a webapp war etc.p  pI copied the jar files to resins projectjars as they were generated by maven for this particular webapp.p  pWhen I deploy the war, resin spots pom.xml and tries to resolve dependencies unfortunately it cannot find any artifacts in its repository projectjars.p  pI suppose this is because all the jars I have put there do not have METAINFmavenpom.xml files packed in them. They are just normal jars like those downloaded by maven.p  pOn pomegranate website they say resin scans projectjars for jars with pom.xml files, to determine their versions. p  pHow should I create jars with pom.xml files includedp  pOr should I manually copy the foobar1.0.pom files from the repository on my devel machine to the resins projectjars directory which kind of beats the purpose of all the automagicp  pThanks for answer,p  pBest regardsp  pHoracep
Negative 1227 pThis issue has nothing to do with whether the assemblies have been signed or caspol has been run for the shared network folder.  Apparently, the location of the files is the issue, but I cannot find what the real problem is.p  pI have one executable that references 5 dlls.  I can run the app from a local drive without any problem.  When I run the app from a network share, I get an error stating that Could not load file or assembly homer, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull or one of its dependencies.

And, as far as I understand, the DNSSD.register will call the serviceRegister method of the ServiceAnnouncer class. But how DNSSD.register knows that it needs to call a method of the ServiceAnnouncer class Can DNSSD.register know that it is called from a particular class in this case ServiceAnnouncer class p

Negative 1227 pI am having a few nagging issues with NSFetchedResultsController and CoreData, any of which I would be very grateful to get help on. p  pIssue 1  Updates I update my store on a background thread which results in certain rows being delete, inserted or updated. The changes are merged into the context on the main thread using the mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification method. Inserts and deletes are updated properly, but updates are not e.g. the cell label is not updated with the change although I have confirmed the updates to come through the contextDidSaveNotifcation, exactly like the inserts and deleted. My current workaround is to temporarily change the staleness interval of the context to 0, but this does not seem like the ideal solution. p  pIssue 2  Deleting objects My fetch batch size is 20. If an object is deleted by the background thread which is in the first 20 rows, everything works fine. But if the object is after the first 20 rows and the table is scrolled down, a CoreData could not fulfill a fault error is raised. I have tried resaving the context and reperforming the frc fetch  all to no avail. Note In this scenario, the frc delegate method didChangeObject.... is not called for the delete  I assume this is because the object in question had not been faulted at that time as it is was outside the initial fetch range. But for some reason, the context still thinks the object is around, although is has been deleted from the store.p  pIssue 3  Deleting sections  When the deletion of a row leads to the deletion of a section, I have gotten the invalid number of rows in section error.

Negative 1227 pIm trying to implement the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCommandpattern relnofollowcommand design patterna, but Im stumbling accross a conceptual problem. Lets say you have a base class and a few subclasses like in the example belowp  precodeclass Command  public boostnoncopyable      virtual ResultType operator0      Restores the model state as it was before commands execution.     virtual void undo0      Registers this command on the command stack.     void register    class SomeCommand  public Command      virtual ResultType operator  Implementation doesnt really matter here     virtual void undo  Same  codepre  pThe thing is, everytime operator codecode is called on a SomeCommand instance, Id like to add this to a stack mostly for undo purposes by calling the Commands register method. Id like to avoid calling register from SomeCommandoperator, but to have it called automaticaly someway  p  pI know that when you construct a sub class such as SomeCommand, the base class constructor is called automaticaly, so I could add a call to register there. The thing I dont want to call register until operator is called.p  pHow can I do this I guess my design is somewhat flawed, but I dont really know how to make this work.p

Negative 1227 pPlease suggest any template matching algorithms, which are independent of size and rotation. any source codes as examples if possible pleasep  pEDIT Actually I understand how the algorithm works, we can resize template and rotate it. It is computationally expensive, but we can use image pyramids. But the real problem for me now is when the picture is made at some angle to object, so that only a perspective transform can correct the image. I mean that even if we rotate image or scale it, we will not get a good match if the object in image is perspectively transformed. Of course it is possible to try to generate many templates at different perspective, but I think it is very bad idea. p  pEDIT One more problem when using template matching based on shape matching. What if image doesnt have many sharp edges For example a plate or dishp  pEDIT  Ive also heard about camera callibration for object detection. What is the algorithm used for that purpose I dont understand how it can be used for template matching.p

It seems like it might be wasteful memorywise if the data is really large, so if every inner hash is stored from scratch it seems that the names of the strongkey namesstrong can take far more sapce than the data itself... Also note that when I build such data structures I often codenstorecode them to disk.p  pI wonder if creating a child strongobjectstrong makes more sense in that perspective, even though I dont really need OO. Will it be more compact Will it be faster to queryp  pOr perhaps representing each child as an array makes sense e.g.p  precodemy name, age, height, weight, haircolor, favoritecolor, listofhobbies  0..7  my childrenh     James gt [James, 12, 1.62, 73, dark brown, blue, [playing football, eating icecream]],    Norah gt [...],    Billy gt [...]  print James height is childrenhgtJames[height]n codepre  pRecall my main concerns are space efficiency RAM or disk when stored, time efficiency i.e. loading a stored dataset then getting the value of property x from instance y and ... convenience code readability etc..p  pThanksp

Negative 1227 pI have an android app on the market for some time 7 month that was labeled as Beta in the title. Yesterday I published a new version and thought its time to leave the beta state. Therefore I switched the apptitle in the market backend and removed the beta tag.p  pThe problem is now, the users dont receive any update notification If you search for the app in the market, the red update label is shown correctly. But in the my apps section, the update label and the notification is never shown. The user doesnt see that theres an update.p  pIt didnt work on my two phones both 2.2, I cleared the market cache and it seems like, nearly all users continue to use the old version. p  pSo, is this a known problem Or was it just a temporary problem on my phone Can anybody confirm this behaviourp  pAnd, what can I do now Switching the title back doesnt seem to help.p  pThanks a lotp  pMarcusp

Negative 1227 pI currently have something working where I can drag a box horizontally on the screen what I want it to do. However, it works when you click ANYWHERE on the screen, and I want it to work only when the box has been clicked. I have tried implementing this in different ways, and Ive looked all over the place and still remain lost. Can anybody help I also cant figure out how a bitmap is placed Im using a bitmap right now as I cant for the life of me figure out how to implement the ImageView inside my SurfaceView.

The problem with objectdetail is that the SQL that pull out the row by specified id is done inside objectdetail and then the object goes to the view. If Im interested in using the form that I created with ModelForm then I want to set a formmymodelFormobject and pass form to the template for rendering. Another way to ask my question is where is the hook in objectdetail that specifies what kind of object is specifiedp

Negative 1227 pEDIT Rephrased question.p  pOther than being bad practice, what other reasons are there against empty paragraphs in HTML p  pORIGINALp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pCurrently to add a nicely space paragraph in our CMS you press Enter key twice. I dont like empty paragraphs because they seem unnecessary to me. If you want a new paragraph, just press Enter and space it with CSS. If you want to write just below some text e.g. to display code, then do a line break with ShiftEnter.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs there any very good reason in not allowing empty paragraphs Is there a standard here Seems like I just have a philosophical issue right now  i.e. using empty paragraphs probably wont make page viewing faster or save that much space.p

Negative 1227 pI want a pointer where I can tell when the reference count is one. Essentially the pointer works like a weakptr, but the cleanup needs to be manual. That is, every so often the program goes through a loop of its pointers and checks which ones have only one reference remaining. Some it will clean, others it will retain a while longer in case somebody needs it again.p  pNow, I know how to do this using a combination of a custom cleanup function and weakptr. I just think the same thing could be accomplished, with simpler code, if I could simply figure out when only one user of the sharedptr remains.p  pI know that sharedptr has a codeusecountcode function, but it has this ominous note in the docs em...not necessarily efficient. Use only for debugging and testing purposes...em Naturally Im not so keen on using something with such a warning.  I dont really need the count anyway, just a way to detect when there is only one left.p  pIs there some boost wrapper that achieves what I want can be in any library Or must I use the technique I already know of custom cleanup function combined with a  weakptrp

Negative 1227 pGood morning,p  pI am currently working on a project that utilises Codeigniter and the Datamapper Library httpdatamapper.wanwizard.eu.

Negative 1227 pIm trying to create a RESTful API for a game.p  pThe game will support both anonymous users users that just want to play now and users that are willing to register.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is that while an unregistered user is still using the same computer, data associated with them will be persisted. Im having troubles meshing that well with also having proper user support for those who choose to register.p  pcodeGET userscreate Users.createcode will create a new anonymous user which will return back the user and a unique token it can be identified byp  pcodePOST usersregister Users.registercode will take an optional token if the user was previously anonymous, an email and a password. It will create a new registered user with the same token, if one was provided  or a new one.p  pcodePOST authlogin Auth.logincode will take an email address and a password, returning the user if successfulp  pcodePOST authauthenticatecode will take a unique token, returning 200500 based on whether or not the token exists in the database.p  pBasically, every call to the server will require one of these unique tokens. Ill be able to use that to track which user its associated with.p  pMy real confusion comes in when trying to implement some sort of remember me function for registered users. If a registered user has one of these unique tokens available, can I use that as the remember me token It seems like this is a poor choice, securitywise and that could cause for a lot of codeauthauthenticatecode failures. Since new tokens have to be created each time a user logs in at a new computer.p  pAm I completely missing something This whole process seems to have security disaster written all over it. Is there a good recipe out there for this sort of behaviourp  pCheers,p  pIanp

Negative 1227 hr  pupdated infop  pI now do not believe this is a timeout issue. But something does seen to create a server error 500. Ive tested with various sets of data and once the size goes over some threshhold, the ajaxError function is called. The server queries a db for rows of data and turns those into an XML string. The db has a onemany set of tables that create the recursivly constructed xml string. The parent table has 2300 rows and the child table has about 20000  so the string is rather large. BUT, this function works fine if I use code like thisp  precode    ltform idtheTax methodpost actionProcessTax gt      TaxonomyHelper th  new TaxonomyHelper1     Html.Rawth.TaxonomyDivTag.ToString           ltformgt codepre  pSo, in this case, a silly amount of data is returned and while it takes over a minute to render done recursively on the client...it works. My goal was to leverage ajax and divide and conquer depending on the users needs always a significant subset of this full dataset. My only curiosity was why, when I do the same thing using ajax, jquery and json, do I get this server error And more importantly, is there some limit that I should check for before asking for a dataset size too big to succeed p  pSo in todays testing, when I subdivide the set to a limit of some smaller size, I do not get an error. And it always works or does not work  as if it measured what the server said was coming across the wire and said nope when that size restriction is hit. I have tried delays, sitting on a breakpoint and other silly measures  Ive tried to carve up the level 2 xml nodes in various forms by adjusting the linq2sql query... no matter what, it always works or always does not work.p  pSo the question now is DOES ANYONE KNOW OF A TOTAL DATA SIZE LIMITATION ON WHAT COMES BACK FROM A SERVER CALL FOR A getJSON CALL It seems that this is true as the relative size of success vs. failure seems pretty close. Id need to add some code to measure size but if someone knows this, thatd be faster p  pthanks again for the swags but I now do believe this may be of value rather than me learning something new about jquery, ajax and how to spell json p  hr  pThe code snippets below are part of a MVC3 app. The JasonResult returned by URL a function named GetJson returns html that is displayed in a div tag. The JasonResult function called GetJason returns a rather small number of chars  approx 10K. GetJasonAll is a rather large number of chars  well in excess of 100K. They are both renderings of a large taxonomy.p  pI trying to find the reason for why the smaller version of the JasonResult works fine while the other fails to display the data. When using the jquery ajax features, Ive tried async, sync and a few other ideas  all to no avail. It seems to act like it times out. But I know the function is returning the data from the JasonResult controller function. But it seems to die there  as if the browser will wait just so long before saying moving on. Ive stepped through the jquery js but cannot seem to find out where the result seems to null out.p  pAny help is appreciated. Note that if I use an ActionResult and pull down the larger data set, Ive no issues with the page. It just takes forever and my strategy was to divide and conquer as I open a recursive list progressivly dependent on a users input. Obviously I can just round trip without ajax but that would be less attractive and Im hoping Im missing something here. p  pOne other bit of info that might be helpful if I put a debugger breakpoint in the processJSON function  the small set obviously hits it but the larger set does not. Which makes sense if theres a timeout issue. In either case, the button that kicks off the script can be clicked immediately.

Negative 1227 pI know there are many questions like this one on SO, but I havent found a good solution so far. The best solutions Ive seen are homegrown, but before implementing a custom tool, Id like to hear your take. So here we gop  pstrongI have a .NET solution with a couple of web applications and a few windows services. I want to automate the rollout of these applications to, say, 1020 different servers  but the appweb.config files on each server may have different values.strongp  pMicrosofts answer to this issue is to have 1020 different web.config files locally on the dev machine, and then using configuration manager to choose the right one. But thats not good enough, because emthe developers dont know about the production server settings, nor should theyemp  pThe ideal solution would be to include a deployment model of some sort where the production servers and their settings are defined, and which could be used with some deployment script could be codePowershellcode as a step in the build server Im using codeTeamCitycode. This could be done by replacing the config settings before XCopying the solution to the remote server. But its a tedious and time consuming task.p  pAnother solution could be to use configSource to point to a folder with a fixed name, but the problem here is that some parts of the config files such as serviceModel cant be used with configSource.p  pSo I havent found the best answer to this.

Negative 1227 pI have VBOs to section off my world, kind of like in the game Diablo. I used to set the vertex data itself to the exact position within the world, but as the position grew, so did the floating point math errors. p  pI have now changed it so that the vertex data is relative to 0,0,0 and I am using glTranslatef to set each VBO to the correct location around the player.p  precodeglPushMatrix glTranslatefmX, mY, mZ draw VBO glPopMatrix codepre  pThis makes it so that the players X and Z positions are always within the range 0512The physical size of 1 VBO and as they leave it, the world shifts the opposite way. This works well and fixes the floating point errors, however it introduced a new error.p  pIn my shader, I create a water waving like effect by taking the cossin of the X and Z positions of the vertex multiplied by the time variable and modify the Y position with them.p  precodeuniform float timeVar ... vec4 v  vec4glVertex v.y  sinv.xtimeVar2cosv.ztimeVar25 ... glPosition  glModelViewProjectionMatrix  v codepre  pThis was working when the vertex positions were exact, but now I suspect they are within the range 0512, as that is what they are all set to before I glTranslatef them to their actual positions.

Id also like to do a lot of selfposting because it might mean I wont have to have a lot of empty files laying around in my views folder.p  pAnother advantage I was thinking about was the fact that if a form is self posting, Id have the benefit of having it used globally. For example, I might have a form in my header that I want my user to fill out anywhere in the website. Or is there a way to detect where the user came from and do a dynamic redirectTop  pMany thanks, Michael.p

Negative 1227 pI have already made a MSI installer with WiX using a custom WPF UI with the EmbeddedUI element. It is similar to the sample found in srcDTFSamplesEmbeddedUI. p  pI would now like to have a bootstrapper that checks if .NET 4 is installed and install it if its not, and then launch my MSI. p  pIt looks like Burn would override my WPF EmbeddedUI in order to chain the .NET 4 and MSI installations into a single installation with a single progress bar. I know that I could have a managed application to change the UI of Burn then pass parameters to my MSI but the problem is that I would like my UI to be in WPF which relies on .NET, and if the whole bootstrapper relies on .NET then the user couldnt even open the bootstrapper if he doesnt have it installed in the first place. p  pWhat I would like is the bootstrapper to install .NET if needed with a simple UI like Wixstdba, and then launch my MSI as it is, with its own WPF EmbeddedUI, without chaining it with the .NET installation. I dont mind that both installations would have their own progress bar, I would just like to be able to use my WPF EmbeddedUI for the installation of the main application. p  pWould that be possible.

Negative 1227 pDuring a proposal about implementing unit tests for our projects, my manager argued that it could be more expensive to create unit tests since you will be maintaining two sets of code. His argument is whenever there is a change in requirementfunctionality, the unit tests can be obsolete, hence the developers should update the tests in order to pass the automated build. He said that it can be inconvenient for the developers since their coding time might be reduced and spent fixing the tests.p  pThe reason I wanted to implement unit tests is to minimize bug occurence especially the critical ones before the codes are turned to validation team for functional test. I also believe that the cost of creating unit tests can be recovered by having better quality systems.p  pRight now, his challenge to me is to create easy to maintain tests that would be easy to modify or if possible tests that will not break easily. I am using xUnit testing frameworks like JUnit and mocking frameworks like mockito and powermock to help in testing.p  pIm looking for tips and techniques on how to write easy to maintain tests or how to avoid brittle test. Are there other tools which can come handy in creating such tests. Im writing codes in Java and C. Thanks.p

Negative 1227 pIm building my first MVC 4Razor web app using Entity Framework 5, and doing a bit of homework before making any design decisions.p  pI see that the EF objects descend from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comquerydev11.queryappIdDev11IDEF1amplENUSampkk28System.Data.Objects.DataClasses.EntityObject29k28TargetFrameworkMoniker.NETFramework,Versionv4.529k28DevLangcsharp29amprdtrue relnofollowcodeEntityObjectcodea, which appears to have a lot of useful bestpractices stuff built it, not least of which is optimistic concurrency handling.  In other words if 2 people load the record of Jane Doe of 123 Maple Street simultaneously, the first one changes her name to Jane Smith and the second one changes her address to 321 Maple Street, then its very easy to allow both changes to be merged into the record without conflicts, while an attempt by a second user to modify the same field as the first user will result in an error.  p  pOn the other hand, it seems pretty standard practice to create lightweight a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDatatransferobject relnofollowData Transfer Objectsa to pass data between the server and the client, and which serve as or in models for the MVC framework.  This is great for ensuring minimal traffic to the client, but it screws up concurrency checking.p  pSo Im questioning the rationale for using DTOs.  What are the reasons for using DTOs  How bad is it to use an codeEntityObjectcode as or within a MVC model  What other solution would you propose to enable optimistic concurrency handling as Ive described abovep

Negative 1227 pThe latest vogue seems to be things that move when you scroll.p  pNow, I have a bunch of square codedivcodes containing a background image scattered around a long page of content. My idea is to ever so slightly make these background images slide upwards when you scroll downwards. The background image is as wide as the square, but 1.5 times as tall.p  pThe easy solution is to set the codebackgroundPositioncode to a fraction of the current codescrollTopcode, but when I thought about it more, its not altogether that simple.p  pEssentially, the background image of a div should be at codebackgroundposition 0 0code when the div is just obscured beyond the fold. Once it appears, the top position would decrease relative to scrolling, until reaching the end of the background images bottom edge once the codedivcode has disappeared over the top edge of the window.p  pThe codedivcodes are codefloatcodeed within text content, so theres no way to hardcode any position values for them.p  pMaybe I could manage to do this on my own, but there are several considerationsp  ul liScrolling back and forth at any speed, and never moving the background image to a location where any part of the square codedivcode wasnt covered.li liDivs which appear in the middle of the page on load. It doesnt matter if the codebackgroundpositioncode isnt code0 0code for them initially, the important thing is that the background image moves at the same speed as all the others.li liAdjusting when the user changes the window size.li ul  pNow since this is just an extra little flair, Im not expecting amazing browser compatibility or that this would work on mobile although if it does, cool.p  pBut I cant even begin to think how all of this would work out. What would be the best way to achieve this Since the scrolling sliding thing is so popular, are there any jQuery plugins that I could utilize to build thisp

Negative 1227 pIn my database I have a codezipcode table with a codecodecode column. The user can upload a list of Zip codes and I need to figure out which ones are already in the database. Currently, I do this using the following Hibernate query HQLp  precodeselect zip.code from Zip zip where zip.code in zipCodes codepre  pThe value of the codezipCodescode parameter is the list of codes uploaded by the user. However, in the version of Hibernate Im using theres a hrefhttpshibernate.onjira.combrowseHHH2166a buga which limits the size of such list parameters and on occasions were exceeding this limit.p  pSo I need to find another way to figure out which of the potentially very long list of Zip codes are already in the database. Here are a few options Ive consideredp  h2Option Ah2  pRewrite the query using SQL instead of HQL. While this will avoid the Hibernate bug, I suspect the performance will be terrible if there are 30,000 Zip codes that need to be checked.p  h2Option Bh2  pSplit the list of Zip codes into a series of sublists and execute a separate query for each sublist. Again, this will avoid the Hibernate bug, but performance will likely still be terriblep  h2Option Ch2  pUse a temporary table, i.e. insert the Zip codes to be checked into a temporary table, then join that to the codezipcode table. It seems the querying part of this solution should perform reasonably well, but the creation of the temporary table and insertion of up to 30,000 rows will not. But perhaps Im not going about it the right way, heres what I had in mind in pseudoJava codep  precode   Indicates which of the Zip codes are already in the database     param zipCodes the zip codes to check   return the codes that already exist in the database   throws IllegalArgumentException if the list is null or empty   ListltZipgt validateZipCodesListltStringgt zipCodes     try       start transaction       execute the following SQL     CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ziptmp     code VARCHAR255 NOT NULL      ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS       create SQL string that will insert data into ziptmp     StringBuilder insertSql  new StringBuilder      for String code  zipCodes        insertSql.appendINSERT INTO ziptmp code VALUES   code                   execute insertSql to insert data into ziptmp       now run the following query and return the result        SELECT z.     FROM zip z     JOIN ziptmp zt ON z.code  zt.code     finally       rollback transaction so that temporary table is removed to ensure      that concurrent invocations of this method operate do not interfere      with each other         codepre  pIs there a more efficient way to implement this than in the pseudocode above, or is there another solution that I havent thought of Im using a Postgres database.p

Negative 1227 pOur task is to read information about table schema from a file, implement that table in cc and then successfully run some select queries on it. The table schema file may have contents like this,p  precode    Tablename Student     ID,int11,NO,PRIMARY,0,. codepre  pNow, my question is what data structures would be appropriate for the task. The problem is that I do not know the number of columns a table might have, neither as to what might the name of those columns be nor any idea about their data types. For example, a table might have just one column of type int, another might have 15 columns of varying data types. Infact, I dont even know the number of tables whose description the schema file might have.p  pOne way I thought of was to have a set number of say, 20 vectors assuming that the upper limit of the columns in a table is 20, name those vectors 1stvector, 2ndvector and so on, map the name of the columns to the vectors, and then use them accordingly. But it seems the code for it would be a mess with all those ifelse statements or switch case statements for the mapping.p  pWhile googlingstackoverflowing, I learned that you cant describe a class at runtime otherwise the problem might have been easier to solve.p  pAny help is appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 1227 pIm trying to read from multiple I2C slave devices using a dsPIC33 microcontroller.p  pI was hoping someone could advise me on the correct method to user a timer interrupt in this case timer1 and collecting the I2C data. p  pSo far I can collect data fine from the I2C slave devices by looping in a while loop, but since attempting to add a timer interrupt so I can apply my own sampling rate rather than collect as fast as you can my I2C software driver is getting stuck.p  pIve tried with a very low timer speed 1Hz at the moment and I2C is on the standard 100KHz speed. The PIC is processing at 80MHz. p  pWhat is the correct method to use timers and I2C modules Ive had a look online and it seems it could be a matter of interrupt priority as when using timer1 I have an interrupt I2C within an interrupt timer1, although no luck so far.p

Negative 1227 pI have some IOS devices week by week to which I must send my apps for testing purposes during development. These devices cant be pluuged to my computer, because they are far away from me and just for this case they wont be taken to my local machine. If plugging would be available, my life would be much easier. But it is not the case.p  pNow I have to do a lot of annoying things by hand add it, regenereate it, delete it from local machine, add to new one etc etc. p  pAfter adding a device to my devices in Apple developer portal Id like to have it in XCode without regenerating certificate, delete, download to my local machine. There should be some automatic refresh process. p  pBefore XCode 4.5 there was an option in organizer to refresh it automatically by Xcode.p  pWhat about in the current XCode versionp

Negative 1227 pIm creating an online Calendar app like Google Calendar or MS Outlook, and strongnot sure how I should store the datastrong to make it fast to query for the basic views Daily, Weekly, Monthly.p  pBefore you mark this as a duplicate, please keep in mind I have read several threads here and in most cases they say too hard to optimize for general purposes.  In my case this is a very specific purpose that I havent seen asked about yet  a very specific type of data which many developers have [hopefully] had experience with.p  pI need to quickly get any rows that land inside my view day, week, month, so something likep  precode[end date of row] gt [start date of query] AND [start date of row] lt [end date of query] codepre  pI dont see a normal btree index working well for this, but I also suspect someone has figured out something clever that will work with SQL Server 2005 and probably older, since calendar apps have been around forever, and there are 100s of them.p  pIm also curious about reoccurring events, how to store those, although my current plan is to just always read all of those index by Is Recurring and optimize that in code, and not SQL. There shouldnt be a huge number of those, unlike normal events which could get very large over time.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Also unique to this question, because it is for a calendar app, I need to store dates with timezone info, but my queries cannot be timezone specific.  If you have experience with a Calendar app, youll know what I mean if not, youll just say store as UTC.p

Negative 1227 pIve designed my database in MySQL Workbench, and have all my foreign keys setup, etc.p  pIm wanting to use this DB schema with Laravel 4, however from the docs there is no word of any sort of ability to work with an existing set of database tables. From my understanding, other frameworks such as Cake with its Baking allow you to automatically generate your model classes based on the tables already in your database.p  pIve looked around everywhere and cant see anything about this at all for Laravel 4. The closest thing Ive found is Jeffrey Ways Generator package for artisan, however this only creates the base model, and doesnt detect established foreign key relationships. p  pIs this even possible with Laravel 4 or am I going to have to just do it all manuallyp

Negative 1227 pthanks for taking time looking at my question.p  pOk so Im working on this iPhone app. Im responsible for the server side code. Client side is asking for a solution to delete private messages from the app. I have created a HTTP DELETE for them that deletes a specific message. But this request deletes the message from the database and that makes the message disappear for both users and not only the one that have choosen to delete it. p  pIve been thinking but I cant seem to find the best solution for this. What I need is a solution to only delete the message for the current user.p  pShould I add some columns in the database that tells which user the private message should be shown for And when a user deletes the message from the app it only stops showing on that users phone. Or is there a better solution for thisp  pI need help with some brainstorming. I hope it is an OK question.p  pThanks p

Negative 1227 pI am BRAND NEW to Matlab like, 5minutes ago new.  I need it to read some files that I have because no other program can read them.  I was hoping someone could help me understand some basic matlab so that I can accomplish this.  I need to go through every file in a folder and perform the function p  precodeX  multibandreadfilename, size, precision, offset, interleave, byte order  codepre  pon each file. X is an array and I need to make a different array for each file.  To further complicate things, the size argument to multibandread is a 3element vector of [height, width,N], and Id like to get the height and width values from other files.  i.e [sizeotherfile, 1 sizeotherfile, 2 2].p  pSo, Im still very much trying to understand matlab.  It seems like a powerful type of command prompt that I can write programs into Is that accurate  Is there a way to point to each file in my program, call multibandread on it, and then move to the next file I know some C programming but know absolutely nothing about matlab.p  pThanks for any help or really any general matlab education anyone can givep

Negative 1227 pIm working with a program that uses a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsqdbm relnofollowqdbma to maintain a keyvalue store qdbm is linked into the program. In certain cases, the process puts a value in the qdbm database and then restarts itself by calling an external init script via system. It appears that sometimes a value written to the qdbm database doesnt actually stick, and Im wondering if it could be due to the data not getting flushed to disk before the process is killed via SIGTERM.p  pSince qdbm does writes using the write system call versus say, the fwrite library function, I would think that the Linux kernel should know to flush everything to disk eventually the system doesnt get restarted, just the process. Also, close does get called on the FD before the process is killed.p  pSo, is my understanding correct, or do I need to add some fdatasync or similar calls in there somewhere Links to authoritative references on the semantics here would also be appreciated.p

Negative 1227 pI am trying to create a program in which the user inputs the amount of numbers, user choiceascending or descending order, and the numbers themselves. Then afterwards it creates an input fileinput.txt in which it contains the amount of numbers, user choice, and the numbers themselves. Then that file is passed through a function in which it reads the input file and creates a output fileoutput.txt in which contains the amount of numbers and the numbers after they are sorted. Currently it is giving me errors when the program  attempts to enter the size and I do not know why. Also I have read Absolute C by Walter Savitch for awnsers but I cant find where it says you can have a program read both numbers and characters in an input file.

Negative 1227 pI need a simple Java service which starts at system boot and uses shared library with some functional which uses POSIX threads. While implementing JNI interface I faced with a some problem which doesnt allow me to make a Java method call from native code. GetMethodID returns not NULL so I suppose it is doing well. Also there is no any suspicious errors which can help.

Negative 1227 pIve implemented a post method as external api which responses large data in json format. How can I use gzip to compress these data to make possible to uncompress by client without any problem Also I use chrome extension Advanced REST Client to make post requests for testing.

RackDeflate in config.ru parses all responses from the server and when I tested with chrome extension Advanced REST Client it wasnt be parsed to json as well.p
Negative 1227 pIm trying to get to grips with the concept of a ViewModelLocator in MVVM Light, although the question applies to the concept of a ViewModelLocator in general, regardles of which MVVM framework is used, and I have a hard time figuring out how to use it.p  pAs I understand it, your views use one of the properties on the singleton instance of the locator as their datacontext. The locator defines these various properties, and returns the proper viewmodel instance for each.p  pThats all fine, but I have trouble understanding how you actually populate these viewmodels with the model data the views are supposed to present.p  pFor instance, suppose I have a view that presents a list of employees. I can create an EmployeesView and an EmployeesViewModel. In the ViewModelLocator, I can create a property that returns this EmployeesViewModelp  precodepublic EmployeesViewModel Employees      get              return ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstanceltEmployeesViewModelgt       codepre  pNow, the viewmodel needs a list of employees, so I can create some sort of dataservice that returns all employees, and register that with the Servicelocator in the ViewModelLocators constructorp  precodepublic ViewModelLocator      ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider gt SimpleIoc.Default     SimpleIoc.Default.RegisterltIDataService, AllEmployeesDataServicegt  codepre  pSo, thisll work, if I instantiate the EmployeesView the EmployeesViewModel will be instantiated and injected with a dataservice that returns all employees.p  pHowever, now I want to see the details of a certain employee that I just clicked in the EmployeesView. This employee presumably has some sort of Id by which to retrieve himher from a database, or whatever.p  pI can create an EmployeeDetailsView and an EmployeeDetailsViewModel, and add a property to the ViewModelLocatorp  precodepublic EmployeeDetailsViewModel EmployeeDetails      return ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstanceltEmployeeDetailsViewModelgt  codepre  pand perhaps register some sort of dataservice in the ViewModelLocators constructorp  precodeSimpleIoc.Default.RegisterltIDataService, EmployeeDetailsDataServicegt codepre  pBut how do I tell either the dataservice or the viewmodel which employee theyre supposed to present the details for Where do I pass the employee id p  pAm I looking at this all wrong Anyone know of any good examples All the examples I can find just return the same single instance of each viewmodel.p

Negative 1227 pIn Varnish, does the std.log subroutine have a performance impact I should be concerned with For example, if I call it 34 times a request, will that have a cumulative effect when dealing with a large number of requestsp  pFrom what I can tell, std.log logs to shared memory by requesting a lock, writing the message, and releasing the lock. This should be pretty fast, but if it happens during every single request wouldnt that affect concurrent requestsp

Negative 1227 pIs there a way to generally NOT minify js files but DO minify a single concatenated versionp  pBasically heres the issue Large project with 100s of files. During development we dont serve up minified js files as they dont add any benefit and just slow us down having to compile a file every time you make a change.  However in production we concatenate the core framework files into a single minified and source mapped file.p  pCurrently we do this using a Bundle via WebEssentials in VisualStudio, the bundle is just an xml file listing the files to concat with attributes saying whether we want it minified and whether we want a source map generated. We also do the same thing with css files. Both are output into a release folder.p

Negative 1227 pbr  I want to access to a server hosted in Lonex trough SSH for file handling. For this I  use PuTTY. To do so safely, I use Pagent, it needs a public and a private key.br  In the server, under the ssh folder in the root directory there are two files br  idrsa  which has the private key.br  idrsa.pub  which has a public key. br  Given this information, if posible, I would like to generate the necesary files for Pagent.p  pWhat I have triedp  pUsing PuTTYgen to importload a local copy of the file idrsa. This successfully generated the the .ppk file needed for Pagent. I refered to the .ppk file in connection  ssh  auth. In this .ppk file appears the public and the private key. But when I use PuTTY to connect, having the generated .ppk added to Pagent, an alert prompts stating that I do not have the servers host key cached in the registry and then shows the servers rsa key fingerprint, which I know to not be the right one from the one shown in Pagent. The fact that this alert prompts tells me that my Pagrent key is not correct. Am I correctp  pCommentsbr br   Given that the host already has a publicprivate key pair I believe I should generate a local private key given the same public key from the host. I could not accomplished this I read about sshkeygen comands but I did not find out how to get what I wanted done.br br   The ISP suggested that everything I need is in this link a hrefhttpsourceforge.netappstracsourceforgewikiSSH20keysKeyGenerationPuTTY relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netappstracsourceforgewikiSSH20keysKeyGenerationPuTTYa br  I could not find the use to it given that I do not have a form where I should place a public key generated locally by me and also the fact that it does not consider the situation where I already have a public key generated in the host. br br   I asked the ISP if it was possible to add a public key generated locally by me to the authorizedkeys2 file and they told me no due to the fact that it is a shared hosting.p  pThank you, Adrin.p

The strange thing is that if I do a fork before, the program works as expected. More specifically, if I uncomment either one of the two fork commands at the end, it works. Hence it does not depend on if its the parent or child process, but somehow the fork event matters. Can someone explain to me whats going on and how to fix my codep  pThanks a lot, Lutzp

Negative 1227 pI want to know about file sharing encryption in windows 7 and windows 8.1. Scenario is I want to share file between two machines with enabled end to end encryption in flight. Now according to my research, SMB2.0 is used to share files and there is no endtoend encryption in SMB 2.0 which means if network packet is captured without IPSec then content of file can be seen in READ RESPONSE packet. While in windows 8.1 and server 2012, SMB3.0 has been introduced which provides endtoend encryption for onflight file sharing.p  pFirstly, I have confusion in default security option for file sharing in windows 7 and 8. File sharing security can be enabled from  Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsNetwork and Sharing CenterAdvanced sharing settings by enabling use 128bit encryption to help protect file sharing connection. What does this option do With this option being enabled if i capture data at network layer using wireshark, will it show me encrypted content of shared file Well I have captured and it shows plain text data. Can anyone tell me how this option worksp  pSecondly, I have shared file between machines running windows 8.1. here again in wireshark captured packet details SMB2.0 is used. Can we enable SMB3.0 for file sharing between peers running windows 8.1 so that files are end to end encrypted inflight I have seen that in server 2012 the option of encrypted access can be enabled for specific shared folders but how this end to end encryption of SMB3.0 can be enabled between peers of 8.1p

Negative 1227 pIm working on a project that is our companies first foray into Domain Driven Development. p  pOur Web API originally simply provided CRUD operations and the project exposed OData controllers, but Im not sure if that is still a good idea.p  pIs OData a good way to expose nonCRUD APIsp  pMore info Initially our web api basically exposed CRUD functions. To create a new User you would simply create one and post it to the service. To change, for example, an address you would get a copy of the user entity, make changes, then perform an update operation. Basic OData stuff.p  pBeyond providing query support, OData also exposed the service in a readily consumable way, so it could be added to other projects as a service reference and accessed with a proxy.p  pSince we have moved over to a DDD approach, things have changed significantly. Our Web API is now simply a gateway to a number of independent subdomain services. We no longer provide CRUD operations or direct access to entities, instead making service calls to manipulate entities. Instead of creating a User entity sending it to the User service via a Put request, a consumer must generate a CreateUserBindingModel and send it to the UserCreate service and let the service generate the entity. Changing an address is done through the ChangeAddressChangeAddressBindingModel model method, rather than just updating the whole object. Queries are much more targeted and rarely if ever return entire domain objects.p  pIs it a bad idea to keep using OData as a basis for our Web API, when we no longer provide CRUD operations Is there another way to expose the details of our service the way you can with OData I know WCF services provide similar functionality, but I was under the impression it was even more tied to CRUD than OData.p

Its in this handler that I asses the actual connection state via a property on the Service and update the ViewModel.p  pNow, all of this works just fine because it is extremely unlikely that the race condition poke its head in. However, in the unlikely case that the Service finishes its initialization before the ViewModel is constructed, it will never handle that Initialized event and will just stay in its Pending state.p  pIve considered changing the Service interface to return awaitable types for properties, so that any module trying to access properties will have to wait for initialization to finish, but Im not sure that this is the best approach. Im also wary of having part of the client kick off the Service because then who should initialize it if several modules use itp  pIs there some conventional way of dealing with this sort of asynchronous initialization that I am missingp

Negative 1227 pIve run into a very puzzling problem regarding a table in a Sqlite database. The table has this simple DDL definitionp  precodeCREATE TABLE [MATable2] [ID] INTEGER  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,   [AName] VARCHAR20,  [AMemo] MEMO codepre  pUsing XE6, DBExpress and v.3.8.5.0 of sqlite3.dll Ive created a project to investigate another SO q.  The project 32bit target is deliberately as minimalist as I could make it, i.e. Ive just pulled off the component palette a SqlConnection, SqlQuery which just does a SELECT  from [MATable2], DataSetProvider, CDS, DataSource, DBGrid and DBNavigator wired up in lefttoright order as it were. The code is equally minimalist, and I dont think I need show it because my problem isnt with the code per se, which works fine.p  pThe problem Ive been getting is this Every now and then, usually after Ive made some blunder that generates an exception like calling CDS.Refresh in its ApplyUpdates event the project I would say or its server if the server in Sqlites case werent just a dll gets into an error condition which persists across restarting the XE6 IDE and rebooting the machine.  It manifests itself by the SqlQuery.Open generating an exception complaining about a mismatch between the expected and actual field types, e.g. in the case of the ID field, the exception will report that it was expecting a WideMemo field but received a LargeInt one instead  its as if there is something off by one in the tables metadata as received by the SqlQuery.p  pThinking this condition might be DBXspecfic, and something to do with Sqlite column types really being thinlydisguised memo fields, I created a FireDac equivalent project and that gets the error condition, too.  Then, the condition clears, as mysteriously as it appeared, usually after I delete the dataset components  TFields and replace them.p  pSo, my question is, does anyone know where can the error cause could be persisting, I mean such that it survives IDE restarts and machine reboots  My first thought was in the DFM, because of what Ive said about how it spontaneously clears.  Next, I suspected the database itself, but it seems perfectly ticketyboo accessed, queried and recreated using two independent Sqlite utilities, Sqlite Expert and the Sqlite Manager addin for Firefox.  The OS reports the disk as wout errors.  Ive looked for persisted info that might be the cause, in Ini files and the Registry, but found nothing obvious.p

Negative 1227 pI have a dropdown whose selected values determines what values are displayed for a group of radio buttons.  I am using jquery .get to an mvc5 controller that returns a partial view containing the radio buttons.  This works fine.  However, when I try to submit the form, the model field for the radio button never binds to the model property.  The other fields on the form bind correctly.  I examined the code via view source and I can see where the name property for the element has a binding of NameControlName instead of NameViewModel.Child.ControlName as the other form element names have.  What is a way to get binding to occur when you are dynamically adding a field to the form  What is the recommended way of handling this scenariop

Negative 1227 pI want to provide a binaryonly program written in C or C where the user has to pass a valid code via command line to be able to use some extra features of the program itself. The idea is to implement some verification strategy in the program which compares the passed code against a runtime generated code which  univocally identifies the system or hardware on which the program is being run.p  pIn other words, if and only if the runtime checkp  precodefltsysinfogt  ltgiven codegt codepre  pis true, then the user is allowed to use the extra features of the program. codefcode is the function generating the code at runtime and codesysinfocode is an appropriate  information identifying the current systemhardware i.e. MAC address of the first ethernet card, Serial Number of the processor, etc...p  pThe aim is to make it as much difficult as possible for the user to guess or guess the way to calculate a valid code without knowing codefcode and codesysinfocode a priori. More importantly, I want it to be difficult to reimplement codefcode by analyzing the disassembled code of the program.p  pAssuming the above is a strong strategy, how could I implement codefcode in C or C and what can I choose as its argument Also what codeGCCcode compiler flags could I turn on to obfuscate codefcode specifically Note that, for example, things like MD5MAC or MD5SHAMAC would be too simple for evident reasons.p  pEDIT Another interesting point is how to make it difficult for the user to attack the code directly by removing or bypassing the portion of the code doing the check.p

Negative 1227 pemSummaryem strongLoading a jar from a running Java program causes a codeNoClassDefFoundErrorcode caused by a codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode caused by interclass dependencies e.g. codeimportcode statements. How can I get around itstrongp  pemThe problem in more detailemp  pI am attempting to programmatically load a jar file  lets call it Server  into the Java Virtual Machine through my own Java program  lets call it ServerAPI  and use extension and some other tricks to modify the behavior of and interact with Server. ServerAPI depends on Server, but if Server is not present, ServerAPI still has to be able to run and download Server from a website. p  pTo avoid errors caused by ServerAPI loading without satisfying its dependencies from Server, I have made a launcher  lets call it Launcher  that is intended to download Server and set up ServerAPI as necessary, then load Server and ServerAPI, then run ServerAPI.p  pHowever, when I attempt to load jars from Launcher, I get errors caused because the ClassLoaders are unable to resolve the other classes in the file that the class its loading depends on. In short, if I try to load Class codeAcode, it will throw an error if codeAcode imports codeBcode because I havent loaded codeBcode yet. However, if codeBcode also imports codeAcode, Im stuck because I cant figure out how to load two classes at once or how to load a class without the JVM running its validation.p  pemWhy all the restrictions have led me to this problememp  pI am attempting to modify and add to the behavior of Server, but for complicated legal reasons, I cannot modify the program directly, so I have created ServerAPI that depends on and can tweak the behavior of Server from the outside. p  pHowever, for more complicated legal reasons, Server and ServerAPI cannot simply be downloaded together. Launcher see above has to be downloaded with ServerAPI, then Launcher needs to download Server. Finally, ServerAPI can be run using Server as a dependency. Thats why this problem is so complex.p  pThis problem will also apply to a later part of the project, which will involve a pluginbased API interface that needs to be able to load and unload plugins from jar files while running.p  pemResearch I have already done on this problememp  pI have read through and failed to be helped byp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9898102javaloadinganexternalclassinruntimethis questiona, which only addresses the issue of a single method and does not address interclass dependency errors li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21921196javaerrornoclassdeffoundexceptionthis questiona, which will not work because I cannot shut down and restart the program every time a jar is loaded or unloaded mainly for the plugin part I briefly mentionedli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10231474noclassdeffounderrorwhendynamicallyaddingjarfilesatruntimethis questiona, which only works for situations where the dependencies are present when the program startsli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions402330isitpossibletoaddtoclasspathdynamicallyinjavathis questiona, which has the same problem as 2li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23132980loadclassthrowsnoclassdeffounderrorcausedbyclassnotfoundexceptionthis questiona, which has the same problem as 3li lia hrefhttpwww.javaworld.comarticle2077260learnjavathebasicsofjavaclassloaders.html relnofollowthis articlea, from which I learned about the hidden loadClassString, boolean method, but trying with strongtruestrong and strongfalsestrong values did not helpli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions194698howtoloadajarfileatruntimethis questiona, which has the same problem as 1li ul  pand more.

If I try to import AVC into TVC so I can access its properties I get an error, which makes sense. I can access the rootViewController byp  precodeUIViewController rootViewController  [[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] window] rootViewController] codepre  pBut that wont bring in the properties of the subclass. Id need to cast it to AVC. Which I cant. So is there a means of accessing the properties of the parent viewcontroller from the contained VC p  pThanksp

Negative 1227 pI am using node.js to launch a serve so that my html can communicate with R code. But I am facing a problem on node.js.

Negative 1227 pI developed a Java application which sends ESCPOS commands to a thermalprinter Sewoo LKTL200 via serial port.

Negative 1227 pAn attempted deployment from localhost to remote server yielded the Error 27123 which, appears to be a credentialsrelated issue. After spending several hours the resolution appears to be one of assigning localtotheremote server Windows credentials that are used to launch DTEexec.exe. I am using VS2012 Ultimate locally with SQL Server 2014 Developer version and remote SQL version 2012 SP1. However, my attempts have failed so far.p  pI would VERY much like to be able to deploy to the remote server inside of VS2012, including creating folders, etc but am still at a loss as to the missing piece needed.p  pWe do not have Active Directory set up as the remote is on the Amazon S3 cloud bit other than that is pretty much a plain vanilla setup. I also noted some folks suggested a Kerberosbased response but before I ask our network guru to proceed Id like at least to get confirmation.p  pI AM able to manually FTP, install and run packages when remoted in but that stinks for my contractor who I would also like to be able to have me out of his way. emsemp  pAll found online materials have not yet yielded the one last piece. I suspect my ignorance rather than the lack of a real solution and would appreciate any guidance. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1227 pSuppose we have an codestdvectorcode, or any other sequence container sometimes it will be a deque, which store codeuint64tcode elements.p  pNow, lets see this vector as a sequence of codesize  64code contiguous bits. I need to find the word formed by the bits in a given code[begin, endcode range, given that codeend  begin lt 64code so it fits in a word.p  pThe solution I have right now finds the two words whose parts will form the result, and separately masks and combines them. Since I need this to be as efficient as possible, Ive tried to code everything without any codeifcode branch to not cause branch mispredictions, so for example the code works in both cases when the entire range fits into a word or when it spans two words, without taking different paths. To do this I needed to code those codeshiftlcode and codeshiftrcode functions, which do nothing but shifting a word by the specified amount, like the codegtgtcode and codeltltcode operators, but gracefully handling the case when codencode is greater than 64, which would be undefined behavior otherwise.p  pAnother point is that the codegetcode function, as coded now, works also for empty ranges, in a mathematical sense, e.g. not only if begin  end, but also if begin  end, which is required by the main algorithm that is calling this function. Again, Ive tried to do this without simply branching and returning zero in that case.p  pHowever, also looking at the assembly code, all this seems far too complex to perform such a seemingly simple task. This code runs in a performancecritical algorithm, which is running a bit too slow. codevalgrindcode told us this function is called 230 million times and accounts for the 40 of the total execution time, so I would really need to make it faster.p  pSo can you help me to find a simpler andor more efficient way to accomplish this task I dont care emtooem much about portability.

Negative 1227 pI am trying to solve regression task using recurrent neural network I use pybrain to build it. After my network is fit I want to use it to make predictions. But prediction of recurrent network is affected by its previous prediction whih in turn is affected by prediction before it etc.p  pQuestion is  once network is trained and I want to make predictions with it on a dataset, how to properly kickstart the prediction process. If I will just call .activate on first example from a dataset for predictions that means that the recurrent connection will pass 0 to network and it will affect the subsequent predictions in an undesireable way. Is there a way to force fully trained recurrent network to think that previous activation result was of a some special value If yes, which value is the best here maybe mean of possible activation output values or smth like itp  pUPDATE. Ok, since no one had any ideas within a day on how to do this with recurrent network in pybrain, let me maybe a bit change a formulation to forget about pybrain. Consider that I build a pybrain network for regression for example, predicting price of a stock. Network will be used with a dataset which has 10 features. I add one additional feature into the dataset and fill it with previous price of from a dataset. Thus I replicate a recurrent network aditional input neuron replicates recurrent connection. The questions arep  p1 In the dataset for training I fill this additional feature with previous price. But what to do with the FIRST record in a training dataset I dont know previous price. Should leave it 0 It should a bad idea, previous price WAS NOT zero. Should I use mean of prices in training dataset Any other suggestions 2 Again, same question as 1 but for running fully trained network against test dataset. While running my network against test dataset I should always pick up its prediction and put the result into this new 11th input neuron before making next prediction. But again, what to do when I need to run first prediction in dataset since I dont know previous pricep

Students who do not pass both modules will be deemed to have failed. Students who fail only one of the two modules will be allowed a resit attempt. Students who fail both modules will be required to repeat the year. Students who pass both modules will be awarded a class based on their aggregate mark using the following scale 70  100    1st 60  69.9   2.1 50  59.9   2.2 40  49.9   3rd The aggregate mark is the mean of the two module marks A list of students taking Irrational Studies is contained in the following file.

Id like to understand the differnces before I start reworking my query generator.  p  pBackground The query is supposed to calculate the Top 6 descendants of a given AppPackage for a given time range, based on the given measure. I start by finding the non empty descendants for the time range, on which I add the topcount, making sure that the time aggregated measure value drives the top calculation. Finally I put the evaluated set on the rows, the time on columns, specifying by where what to see. It works out nicely, besides the described effect.p

Negative 1227 pI am using nginclude in my application. Its working, but Im wondering if this is a good way of doing nginclude. The html inside the nginclude file is calling the function from its parent.p  pThe example can be seen in this a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditPxP3WLaKfcAHxBskHmaQppreview relnofollowplunkra. The plunkr doesnt show the button, but the idea is the element from nginclude file is calling out its parent function. Is that bad practice Is there an alternative for this  For example, the html in my nginclude contains thisp  precode  ltbutton classmybutton ngclickctrl.parentFngtltbuttongt codepre  pThe reason I asked is because I have a directive where there is a default template with the buttons. If user want to specify custom template like different positioning of the button, or more elements they can specify the custom template but they are allowed to use the default functionality ngclick from its parent controller. p  pAny comments are really welcomed and appreciated.p
Negative 1227 pI am having trouble trying to initialize a variable correctly. Earlier I was getting a Number Format Exception because I was parsing an integer inside of an empty text field. Now I have created an if statement that checks first to see if the field is empty, then parses an integer inside of it. The problem im having now is that my event handler cant recognize the variable, because it is inside the if statement. I tried declaring it outside of the if statement but that didnt work either.

Negative 1227 pHeyya,p  pI know this question has been asked before and I have read each and every answer of every single question here but still cant seem to get my project working properly. My scenario is a bit different than other questions though, not sure if this makes any difference but here we go.p  pI have a project made of web services. Services alone works fine, there is no problem with that. And there is this another project which handles the UI part of things and call these services through jquery ajax. It has been working fine because I havent tested this case on Google Chrome before. Everything works perfectly on Internet Explorer.p  pNow my web service application runs on port 40000 localhost40000 and the UI project runs on some other random port but still in the localhost. Like I said, my ajax calls etc works perfectly on Internet explorer but when it comes to Google Chrome it fails. The console shows the following errorp  precodeXMLHttpRequest cannot load http127.0.0.140000abc.asmxTheMethodName. No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin httplocalhost17256 is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 400. codepre  pBy the way, it was like localhost40000 before so some post on the internet suggested that I should change it to an IP address instead of localhost.p  pAnyway, I have also edited my web.config file on my web service project and added the following which doesnt make any sensep  precodeltsystem.serviceModelgt   ltbindingsgt     ltwebHttpBindinggt       ltbinding namecrossDomain crossDomainScriptAccessEnabledtruegt       ltbindinggt     ltwebHttpBindinggt   ltbindingsgt    ltbehaviorsgt      ltserviceBehaviorsgt       ltbehaviorgt         ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledtrue gt         ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultsfalse gt       ltbehaviorgt     ltserviceBehaviorsgt    ltbehaviorsgt    ltserviceHostingEnvironment multipleSiteBindingsEnabledtrue gt ltsystem.serviceModelgt   ltsystem.webServergt   ltmodules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststrue gt   lthttpProtocolgt     ltcustomHeadersgt       ltadd nameAccessControlAllowOrigin valuehttplocalhost17256 gt       ltadd nameAccessControlAllowOrigin value gt       ltadd nameAccessControlAllowMethods valueGET, POST, OPTIONS gt       ltadd nameAccessControlAllowHeaders valueOrigin, XRequestedWith, ContentType, Accept gt       ltadd nameAccessControlMaxAge value1728000 gt      ltcustomHeadersgt   lthttpProtocolgt ltsystem.webServergt codepre  pBTW, if I use the first line  it completely fails and says the response header messages do not match and I cant even start the service invoke.p  pAnd yes, I have also edited my ajax call, added the following parameterp  precodecrossDomain true, codepre  pNow, what am I missing here I have been on this for days now and I am about to lose my mind  It is kinda too late to change the whole structure of the project service  UI style I mean since loads of code have been written to the services and UI projects. Please help Im desperate p  pCheersp  hr   pstrongEditstrongp  pSo it turns out I need to use JSONP, not JSON  since it doesnt get stuck with Access Control thing, which is fine. I can convert my ajax calls into JSONP ones. But I need another help p  pI have written a global ajax method that is called from each operation on seperate pages and it works like charm on Internet Explorer again of course. Now what should I do to convert this wrapper function into a jsonp thingy p  precodefunction RemoteCallWebService, RemoteMethod, RemoteParameters, callbackResult   if RemoteParameters  null  RemoteParameters        RemoteParameters      var remoteCall  .ajax     type POST,     url ProvideServiceWebService, RemoteMethod,     data RemoteParameters,     contentType ajaxContentType,     dataType ajaxDataType,     async true,     crossDomain true,     success function msg          msg.headerAccessControlAllowOrigin,          callbackResultmsg.d     ,     error function xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError          callbackResultxhr.status  rn  thrownError  rn  xhr.responseText       codepre  pp  pI saw some posts that I should add a property as jsonp jsonpcallback with the callback method this is where I am confused. What about thisp  pAnother thing I have been sending my json parameters as a text in a variable like p  precodevar jSONParams   UserID 1, EmailAddress ab.com   codepre  pShould I keep sending this as the same format or should it be converted to some sort of JSON object or somethingp  pBTW my global ajax function is in a completely seperate JS file  not sure if it makes any difference though...p  pCheersp

Negative 1227 pI am creating panel data by importing from a databases API using a function called codeinstancecode which generates a pd.DataFrame column of 200 dict objects, each containing the values for the same variables e.g. Number of comments and Number of views corresponding to one of the 200 members of the panel.p  pThis data is constantly being updated in real time and the database does not store its data. In other words, if one wants to keep track of how the data progresses over time, one must manually call the function codeinstancecode every desired period e.g. every hour.p  pI am wondering how I would go about writing a program to passively run my codeinstancecode function every hour appending it to every other hours execution. For this purpose, I have found the codethreadingcode module of potential interest, particularly its codeTimercode program, but have had difficulty applying it effectively. This is what I have come up withp  precodedef instancelogyear, month, day, loglength     start  datetime.datetime.now         log  instanceyear,month,day     t  threading.Timer60, log.joininstanceyear, month, day     t.start     if datetime.datetime.now gt startdatetime.timedeltahoursloglength         t.cancel         returnlog codepre  pI tried running this program for loglength1 i.e. update the codelogcode DataFrame every minute for an hour, but it failed. Any help diagnosing what I did wrong or suggesting an alternate means of achieving what Id want would be greatly appreciated.p  pBy the way, to avoid confusion, I should clarify the inputs codeyearcode, codemonthcode, and codedaycode are used to identify the 200 panel members so that I use the same panelists for each iteration of instance.p

The query time massively increase 12 seconds to 90 seconds but I can only presume this is because of the increase in size of data.p  pBefore I paste out the query, the following is a quick explanation of the tablesp  ul listrongflaggedcasesstrong list of unique cases main table  352 rowsli listrongdatasourcesstrong list of data sources, each cases references this table using a foreign key  20 rowsli listrongmatchesstrong rows of text matches for a case onetomany relationship, i.e. one case, many matches  22000 rowsli listrongflaggedcaseskeywordshitsstrong mapping of case ids to keywords and number of hits  2500 rowsli listrongkeywordsstrong list of keywords  121 rowsli listrongreviewedstatestrong iddescription for 3 states, only ever checking reviewedstate  1 for this query  3 rowsli ul  pThe following is the query, I realise its pretty sizeable but I think there must be an underlying issue with indexes that unfortunately I just dont have the knowledge to fully troubleshoot so any help is appreciated.p  precodeSELECT    flaggedcases.id,            datasourceid,            title,            fetchdate,            publishdate,            caseid,            casetitle,            caselink,            relevancescore,                                 SELECT   groupconcatmatchstringhighlighted ORDER BY matches.id SEPARATOR                     FROM     matches                     WHERE    flaggedcaseidflaggedcases.id AS allmatches,            reviewedstateid,                                 SELECT   groupconcatconcatk.keyword,  , x, castkh.hits AS CHAR,  SEPARATOR                     FROM     flaggedcaseskeywordshits kh                     JOIN     keywords k                     ON       kh.keywordid  k.id                     WHERE    kh.flaggedcaseid  flaggedcases.id                     ORDER BY k.weighting DESC AS hitcount  FROM      flaggedcases  JOIN      datasources  ON        flaggedcases.datasourceid  datasources.id  JOIN      reviewedstate  ON        flaggedcases.reviewedstateid  reviewedstate.id  LEFT JOIN matches  ON        flaggedcases.id  matches.flaggedcaseid  WHERE     reviewedstateid  1  AND       datasourceid IN1,                              3,                              4,                              5,                              6,                              7,                              8,                              9,                              10,                              11,                              12,                              13,                              14,                              15,                              16,                              17,                              18,                              19,                              20  AND       fetchdate gt 20150510 000000  AND       fetchdate lt 20150517 235959  GROUP BY  flaggedcases.id  ORDER BY  title DESC  LIMIT     10 codepre  pAs a result of doing SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST I can see the query stays in the Sending data state which from some research I can see is basically MySQL fetching and selecting data so I can only presume there must be a missing index or something causing this to slow down.p  pIve also obtained the EXPLAIN of the query, which is as followsp  precode  id  selecttype         table           type    possiblekeys                     key              keylen  ref                         rows  Extra                                            1  PRIMARY             reviewedstate  const   PRIMARY                           PRIMARY          4        const                          1  Using index Using temporary Using filesort    1  PRIMARY             datasources    range   PRIMARY                           PRIMARY          4        NULL                          19  Using where                                     1  PRIMARY             flaggedcases   ref     datasourceid,reviewedstateid  datasourceid   4        proactive.datasources.id     14  Using where                                     1  PRIMARY             matches         ref     flaggedcaseid                   flaggedcaseid  4        proactive.flaggedcases.id    32  Using index                                     3  DEPENDENT SUBQUERY  kh              ref     flaggedcaseid,keywordid        flaggedcaseid  5        func                           3  Using where Using temporary                    3  DEPENDENT SUBQUERY  k               eqref  PRIMARY                           PRIMARY          4        proactive.kh.keywordid        1  Using where                                     2  DEPENDENT SUBQUERY  matches         ref     flaggedcaseid                   flaggedcaseid  4        func                          32                                                 codepre  pAny help  advice  hints massively appreciated p

Negative 1227 pIm looking at a waterfall in Chromes Developer tools of several CSS and Javascript files.p  pWhen refreshing the page, several of the files load from the browser cache, as expected. These are taking 1ms to load most of the time. However some files, and it seems to be the same offenders each refresh, are taking quite a bit longer. Sometthing between 400ms and 800ms. p  pThe waterfall timeline in Chromes network tab shows that this time is spent in the TTFB time to first byte in some cases. This doesnt make any sense to me, if its getting it from the browser cache it should be getting it from the hard drive, not the server, why is there a TTFBp  pFor other files or sometimes on a different refresh I see the time is blamed on content dowloaded time. Again, coming from cache this should be pretty instantaneous, yet Im seeing it take over half a second sometimes.p  pCan anyone shed some light on whats happening here This is a web app Im working on so I dont have a link I can share Im afraid.p

Negative 1227 pSo assume you have lots of stuff to draw with a sample time of 10ms, namely 9 chartsgraphs based on qcustomplot library and a GLWidget. Now all the computation, with which i mean maths, is performed in a separate thread yet instructions like populate the array of the 1 chart or clean the chart are performed in the GUI thread clearly at a speed of 10ms.p  pMy problem is that basically, due to the high frequency of the drawing, buttons become unresponsive.p  pNow my question is Is there a way to improve the performance of my code I would like to avoid to draw every 50ms rather than every 10ms.

In the form is displaying fine, but what I want to do is when submit is clicked, I want each row to be added to the database where the selected team and the game number are submitted. p  pThe problem Im having is that only one row is getting submitted, and the radio buttons arent sending the value unless I leave the radio button the original name but then each repeating row is under one big group so I cant select a winner for each game, only one for the whole form.p  pAny advice would be great, I need to find out how to somehow store each rows values into arrays and then loop through the arrays to insert them into the databasep

Negative 1227 pI know the question is very long, but in a nutshell its just that. As you know Netbeans has a feature with the help of inno setup that allows the creation of .exe installers of Java applications. The problem is that I would like to change the default icon it has a grey java icon for a custom one.p  pI have searched a lot through both Stack and Google and I havent found anything. The closest it got is to change it via Launch4j. The thing is if it is possible to do it within Netbeans.p  pFurthermore, I was wondering if there is a possibility to add several languages to the installer and some other features like the creation of a desktop icon. I guess if the option exists it would be in the same place as the changeicon... but I am completely lost regarding this issue.p

Negative 1227 pIm curious how android handles the children of hero views in the shared element transition one can see in Google Keepp  pIn the standard shared elements transition, on the enter animation, the hero views in the calling activity are instantaneously overlaid with the destination view at the starting dimensions before the transition animates changes in the destination views dimensions to get to their new location. p  pHowever, on the return animation, the returning activitys views remain on top of the overlay, and they are the views that are displayed until the animation ends, at which point the destination calling activitys hero views snap into place.p  pThis creates a pretty jarring effect if theres any differences in the content of the two hero views  for example, a textview where the lines wrap differently, or different child views altogether.p  pMeanwhile, in Google Keep, the shared element transition seems to fade the content views back and forth each way, so this jarring effect is considerably less noticeable. Consequently differences in things like padding or line wrapping are much less problematic.p  pWhats the best way for me to implement this in my own appp

Negative 1227 pI was asked to develop a login system using html,jsp and servlets. The login page should ask the user for userid and password and after authentication should display a welcome message. There should also be provisions for adding a new user and changing the password of an existing user. However the catch here is that I have been asked to use a hashtable instead of a database system. I have a fairly good idea of implementing this system with Oracle .

I also tried throwing the codeltpagesgtcode inside the codeltStackPanelgtcode that holds my RadioButtons, but it does something weird, where it appears my Home Page is inside the SplitView Pane under the buttons.

Negative 1227 pI want to align a button relative to another button in my layout.

I would search my mistake somewhere else if setting it relative to the layout didnt work either, but strangely it does work perfectly fine. Just adding the rule for specific buttons in the codelayoutcode doesnt work.p  pMy codebutcode is a custom class that inherits from codeButtoncode, just in case that matters.p  pSorry for the low quality screenshot but Google servers just went down so I only got the thumbnail. However, you see whats happening. The upper picture shows what happens with ALIGNRICHT, but[ 4][ 1] and the lower shows the same with ..., layout.
