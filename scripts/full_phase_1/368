The parsed data is corrupted sometimes.p  pOriginally I serialized instances of selfdefined class manually, with each instance being a line in a text file. However, the speed was slow.The text file was dealt in a speed of 2 MBsec, which can be seen in windows task manager. Recently I changed to use the boost binary serialization. However, strange things happens.p  pI stored many many instances of class InstanceIdentity, which contains a string member variable and a struc member variable representing the xyz integer coordinates.p  pMy Problem The previous 504 instances can be parsed from the binary file successfully and printed to screen. However the 505th instance is falsely parsed.The xyz coordinates should be no more than 512. And then the following instances become a mess. And soon an unknown exception is thrown from boost. I tried to catch it and used the .what method to reveal more information. However, it only says codeUnknown Exceptioncode.p  precodeline 503 0294.sraw.gz 306, 215, 64 line 504 0294.sraw.gz 224, 154, 86 line 505 0294.sraw.gz 68109, 36608, 16384  Then the screen output becomes a mess.

Positive 368 pSorry for a possible duplicate post, I saw many similar topics here but none was exactly I needed. Before actually posting a question I want to explicitly state that this question is NOT A HOMEWORK. p  pSo the question is how to convert a large integer number into binary representation The integer number is large enough to fit in primitive type Java long cannot be used.

Instead, I want to implement an algorithm.p  pSo far I ended up with the following approach Input and output values represented as strings. If the last digit of input is even, I prepend the output with 0, otherwise  with 1. After that, I replace input with input divided by 2. I use another method  strongdivideByTwostrong for an arithmetical division. This process runs in a loop until input becomes 0 or 1. Finally, I prepend input to the output.

An example of this is youtubedl, which is a python program that can be executed with the simple command codeyoutubedl [input]code. As far as I have understood, this is simply because there exists a file called codeusrbinyoutubedlcode, and codeusrbincode is in PATH. However, I do not understand what I have to do to make something like this myself. Right now, I have a python project called codetestprojectcode that includes a python program like this codetestprojectfilesmyownprogram.pycodep  pWhat do I have to do to make this a binary executable such as youtubedlp  pI know I can make an codealias moppython testprojectfilesmyownprogram.pycode, and this is also what I have done, and it works fine. That is, I can write code mopcode, and successfully run my program.  But for curiositys, and learnings, sake, I want to know how to make a file such as the codeusrbinyoutubedlcode file, removing the need for aliases.p  pI find this hard to find information about in search engines... Any help is greatly appreciated p  pstrongEditstrongp  pMy question differs from the one marked as duplicate, in that Im not looking to execute it as a .shscript. I simply want to execute it as a suffixless oneword command, similar to all the other executables that are in codeusrbincode. p  pEx. code myowncode should run my program, without the need for aliases or writing .sh or .py at the prompt. That is, I want to have a file codeusrbinmyowncode that somehow runs my codetestprojectcode at the simple command codemyowncodefrom anywhere.p
Negative 368 pIs there a .net equivalent to the C unexpectedsetunexpected functionalityp  phr p  pstrongEditstrong  SorryI omitted some details previouslyp  pLanguage C 2.0p  pI have some legacy apps that seem to be throwing some unhandled exception somewhere.  I just want to put something in place to stop the customers pain until I can trace the actual source of the problem.  In C, the function pointed at by setunexpected gets called, as far as I know, when an otherwise unhandled exception bubbles to the main routine.

Negative 368 pGood morning,p  pApologies for the newbie question.  Im just getting started with ASP.NET internationalization settings.p  pBackground infop  pI have a website which displays a codelttablegtcode HTML object.  In that codelttablegtcode HTML object, I have a column which displays dates.  My server being in the US, those dates show up as codeMMDDYYYYcode.  Many of my users plug into this webpage through Excel, via the Data  Import External Data  Import Web Query interface.  My users, for the most part, are in the US, so those dates show up correctly in their Excel screens.p  pNow I need to make the webpage work for UK users.  As is, they are downloading the dates as codeMMDDYYYYcode, which makes their spreadsheets unusable since their regional settings are set to codeDDMMYYYYcode.p  pMy question isp  pHow do I make it so the web server realizes that the incoming request has a codeenGBcode culture setting  I could engineer my own little custom workaround, but Im sure Im not the first programmer to come across this.  How do the pros handle this  Im looking for a solution that would be relatively simple and quick to put up, but I dont want to just put some crappy buggy piece of my own logic togethe that Im going to dread 6 months from now.p  pThanks a lot in advance, Alan.p

Negative 368 pWhen starting my application, I have a couple of classes which are required to read certain files in order to create a set of default data.p  pThe logical place to me to do this is in a Shared class constructor the idea would be to throw a classlevel event if the reading of the defaults file fails. Unfortunately, this does not work as attempting to access such an event, in order to attach a handler to it, fires the class constructor embeforeem the event has been attached. In a failing case, the constructor starts, fires the fail event, the constructor completes, and then the event handler is attached, emafterem the event has fired.p  pThe only other solution I can think of is to give the class a typeInitialisedSuccessfully boolean property and put a trycatch block around emeveryem call to construct an instance of the class, which seems unnecessarily kludgey to me.p  pCan someone suggest a more elegant solutionp  pEDIT Because this is a fundamental Class, used in one form or another across nearly all of our software tools, I would greatly prefer a solution that will notify future programmers that the type initialiser needs to be called, which is why I initially went towards the Shared Constructor as a solution.p

Here is an example of what I am attempting to accomplishp  pre public partial class MainWindow  Window      public static Service binding     public static Result lr     public progressDialog dlg      private void login              string sPwd  txtPwd.Password         string sEmail  txtEmail.Text         binding  new Service         lr  binding.loginsEmail, sPwd          private void btnLoginClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              BackgroundWorker worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.DoWork  new DoWorkEventHandlerworkerDoWork         worker.RunWorkerCompleted  new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandlerworkerRunWorkerCompleted         worker.RunWorkerAsync         dlg  new progressDialog         dlg.Show         login          private void workerDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e              e.Result  login          private void workerRunWorkerCompletedobject sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e              this.Hid         Window1 newWindow  new Window1         newWindow.Show         dlg.Close       pre  pI know that as this stands, it will not work because login is a void and does not actually return a value to use with e.Result in the DoWork event.  However, I have set up a login class to pass the parameters to and I still receive errors stating that I cannot access the UI thread.  The main problem is that lr and binding are accessed by another window so they must be public static data from the other window I set public static Service binding  MainWindow.binding.  Im just having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around how exactly to set this up.p
Negative 368 pThis happens to me a lot and Ive yet to find a good solution. Say you have two classes, Tree com.company.Tree and Fruit com.company.Fruit. On the stage in Flash, the Tree has an instance of Fruit classfruit1, base classcom.company.Fruit, and its instance name is fruit. Everything is fine, until you duplicate the tree and fruit movie clips to create a 2nd tree, which has a DIFFERENT instance of Fruit classfruit2, base classcom.company.Fruit, but whose instance name in the 2nd tree is also fruit. This is necessary because the code for the Tree class references fruit fruit.x  20, for example.p  pI get thisp  precode Warning All instances named fruit will be automatically declared as fruit1 in symbols that use fruit as their base class.

Negative 368 pI have a domain object that stores some metadata and some raw bytes. This is used for storing binary objects such as PDF documents and images.p  pI would like to persist the metadata in a database so it can be easily queried but I want to store the raw bytes in the file system for performance reasons. What is a good design for achieving thisp  pShould I have a domain object representing the raw bytes with its own DAO to perform CRUD and a separate JPA DAO to do the same for the metadatap  pIf that is the case would the domain object for the metadata contain a reference to the raw byte object that is marked as transient so JPA wont attempt to persist itp  pAm I following an overly complex design for little benefit over storing raw bytes in the database Im using PostgreSQL 8.x if that makes a difference.p  pMany thanks.p

This schema can also be modified at any time. This application will be installed at the customer location, and will need to function even when they change their field structure.p  pIn order to insert or update a record, I first call their Project.GetSchema method, which returns the XSD file based on the current set of fields, and then I can call the Project.AddProject method, passing in an XML file containing the project data.p  pstrongMy question isstrong Whats the best way to generate the XML from the XSD file at runtime I need to be able to check for the existence of fields, and fill them out only if they exist for instance, if the customer deleted or renamed some fields. p  pI really dont want to have the application attempting to recompile classes on the fly using xsd.exe. There simply must be a better way.p  pstrong[update]strong My current solution, that Im working on, is to basically parse out the XSD file myself, since the majority of the schema is going to be the same for each installation. Its just an ugly solution, and I was hoping there was a better way. The biggest problem I have is that their schema uses xsdsequence, so putting things in a different order always breaks validation.p

Negative 368 pWith reference to this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2122546howtoimplementtagcountinghttpstackoverflow.comquestions2122546howtoimplementtagcountingap  pI have implemented the suggested 3 table tagging system completely. To count the number of Articles per tag, i am using another column named tagArticleCount in the tag definition table. other columns are tagId, tagText, tagUrl, tagArticleCount.p  pIf i implement realtime editing of this table, so that whenever user adds another tag to article or deletes an existing tag, the tagdefinitiontable is updated to update the counter of the addedremoved tag. This will cost an extra query each time any modification is made. at the same time, related link entry for tag and article is deleted from tagLinkTable.p  pAn alternative to this is not allowing any real time editing to the counter, instead use CRONs to update counter of each tag after a specified time period. strongHere comes the problem that i want to discuss.strong This can be seen as caching the article count in database. Can you please help me find a way to present the articles in a list when a tag is explored and when the article counter for that tag is not up to date. For example 1. Counter shows 50 articles, but there are infact 55 entries in the tag link table that links tags and articles. 2. Counter shows 50 articles, but there are infact 45 extries in the tag link table.p  pHow to handle these 2 scenerios given in example. I am going to use APC to keep cache of these counters. Consider it too in your solution. Also discuss performance in the realtime  CRONNED counter updates.p

Negative 368 pIm using DBDeploy.NET for change control management in my TSQL codebase.  DBDeploy works by the developer maintaining a numbered set of change scripts.  When a deploy is triggered via NAnt, DBDeploy looks at a changelog table and determines which patches need to be executed to bring the instance up to date.p  pThe issue I have is with setting the required settings necessary to create an indexed view.  QUOTEDIDENTIFIER, ANSINULLS, and ARITHABORT all need to be on.  Yes, I can easily put these SET statements at the top of the change script that createsalters the indexed view.  But these settings are connection level.  What if later Im building a new instance from scratch  When I run DBDeploy on the new instance, these settings will bleed through to all subsequent change scripts, since all change scripts are effectively concatenated into a final SQL script to be executed on a single connection.  Whats worse are parsetime options like QUOTEDIDENTIFIER, which would be applied to all change scripts prior as well.  Sop  ol liIm on SQL Server 2000.  Is my interpretation of connectionlevel settings correct  I.e. using GO to break the script into batches does nothing to limit the scope of these SET options.  What about later versions, where connectionlevel settings have been renamed batchlevelli liIs there any way to unSET the SET  As I understand it, connectionlevel settings are trinary  i.e. ON, OFF, and default, where default is interpreted based on the content of the SQL statement, instance settings, database settings, and persisted user settings.  If I SET something to ON, I cant undo it simply undo it by setting it to OFF, because it would mask default, if thats what the setting was before.li liIs there any way to save the state of the connectionlevel setting before setting it, so I can manually restore it afterli ol  pThe alternatives suckp  ol liI can wrap each createalter statement for indexed views in dynamic SQL  with its 40008000 char limitation on SS2K.  That would limit the scope of SET statements quite well.li liI can institute a policy of fixing the SET options to be used at the project level, and requiring all devs to place those SET options at the top of each change script to enforce it, since theres no telling until deploy time precisely which change scripts will be applied.li liI can patch DBDeploy itself to always use a new connection for each change script, but that would require redesigning the way it handles undoing change scripts.li ol  pSo what can be done, and what should I dop

I was prompted to ask the question due to Google analytics new code which uses both of these methods.p  hr  pI recently noticed that Google analytics is now suggesting including its Javascript snippet right before the codeltheadgtcode tag. They used to suggest including the snippet right before the codeltbodygtcode tag.p  pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comperformancerules.html relnofollowYUI Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Sitea suggests putting scripts as far down the page as possible, since scripts can block parallel downloadsp  blockquote   pThe problem caused by scripts is that they block parallel downloads. The HTTP1.1 specification suggests that browsers download no more than two components in parallel per hostname. If you serve your images from multiple hostnames, you can get more than two downloads to occur in parallel. While a script is downloading, however, the browser wont start any other downloads, even on different hostnames.p blockquote  pGoogle saysp  blockquote   pOne of the main advantages of the asynchronous snippet is that you can position it at the top of the HTML document. This increases the likelihood that the tracking beacon will be sent before the user leaves the page. It is customary to place JavaScript code in the codeltheadgtcode section, and we recommend placing the snippet at the bottom of the codeltheadgtcode section for best performance.p blockquote  pIm generally more concerned with user experience and page load speed than making sure each and every tracking beacon is sent, so this would push me toward including the Google analytics script toward the bottom of the page, instead of in the codeltheadgtcode, rightp  pIm sure theres more things to consider than these two points of view.

Negative 368 pI am trying to figure out the best, or most efficient way of doing this.p  pMy website is written in PHP on the server side, with a MySQL DB and using javascript and jQuery on the client side.p  pThe user comes to this one specific page i.e. map.php which contains an image map. There are five different clickable areas on this map. Each area has a queue of images that will go down the queue, loading each image sequentially as the user clicks on the image. For example, if you click on area A then it might generate the queue A1.jpg, A2.jpg, A3.jpg, A4.jpg, map.jpg. First it will load image A1.jpg, when the user clicks on the image, it then loads A2.jpg etc. The last image returns them back to the main map.p  pWhen they click on one of the five areas on the main map, javascript removes all the clickable areas and creates a new area which is the whole image for the user to click on. Returning back to map.jpg also readds the five image map areas.p  pTo make things a bit more complicated. None of the 5 areas have the same queue and you might not keep coming back to the same image queue.p  pFor example, the first time you click on area A you might go through A1, A2, A3, A4 and map. The second time they return to A the queue might be A3, A4, map. A trigger by viewing an external page outside of map.php might turn the next queue into A5, A3, A4, or A6, A3, A4 or A7, A3, A4. A final image queue could be A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, ... A18.p  pAnd image map area B, C, D and E can all have different image queues.p  pNow I am trying to think of how to do this but no matter how I try and write it, it seems overly complicated and there must be a better way. I thought of possibly storing each possible image queue in the DB and then store what state each user is at on map.php. But the database state might need to change and since the frontend is in javascript I wasnt sure how to do this. Theres also the issue of preloading the images to try and get them as smooth as possible.p  pThats why I am here to try and ask for ideas and opions, try and bounce ideas around to help me think of a better way to do this.p

Similarly, on the portfolio page if you click forward and backward through the images, eventually an image will no longer show up.  Again, looks like the image is there but its not being displayed.

Negative 368 pAs it is set up now, I have two UITextViews inside of a UIScrollView. The point of this is that the UITextViews themselves dont scroll, they just get larger their contentsize as more text is added. The UIScrollView handles all of the scrolling up and down of the view regardless of how much text there is think similar to Mail.app where the subject view is above the message view, etc. That said, Ive ran into a problem now. When I programmatically add text to my UITextView in this code, bodyText, the UIScrollView automatically scrolls to the bottom for some reason.p  pTo add the text I just do p  precodeNSRange selectedRange  [bodyText selectedRange] NSString selectedText  [bodyText.text substringWithRangeselectedRange] bodyText.text  [bodyText.text stringByReplacingCharactersInRangeselectedRange withString[NSString stringWithFormatltbgtltbgt, selectedText]] codepre  pSo, for instance, if I had 2000 pixels vertically of text and was currently scrolled to position 400 and then added text somewhere around there, the UIScrollView would then go all the way down to 2000.p  pIve tried to stop it via subclassing UISCrollView and overriding setContentOffset, but that freezes all scrolling then.p  pMy question is, why does it scroll all the way to the bottom in the first place The text is added when the user clicks a button somewhere else on the screen, and the scrolling has nothing to do with any finger drags or anything.p

Negative 368 pIm using JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database. We are trying to block access to the database for the users themselves instead they should be forced to use our frontend. We blocked access to any table, and gave only procedures, which do all the work for users, still not giving them any opportunity to access data directly. We tried to block access to schema pgcatalog, which limits users to procedures we created, but it seems that this access is needed for JDBC to call any procedure.p  pAnyway, the question is either how to use JDBC without access to pgcatalog, or how to authorize only connections made by application, not user.p

Negative 368 pI have an application that uses the Oracle MERGE INTO... DML statement to update table A to correspond with some of the changes in another table B table A is a summary of selected parts of table B along with some other info.  In a typical merge operation, 56 rows out of 10s of thousands might be inserted in table B and 23 rows updated.p  pIt turns out that the application is to be deployed in an environment that has a security policy on the target tables.  The MERGE INTO... statement cant be used with these tables ORA28132 Merge into syntax does not support security policiesp  pSo we have to change the MERGE INTO... logic to use regular inserts and updates instead.  Is this a problem anyone else has run into  Is there a bestpractice pattern for converting the WHEN MATCHEDWHEN NOT MATCHED logic in the merge statement into INSERT and UPDATE statements  The merge is within a stored procedure, so its fine for the solution to use PLSQL in addition to the DML if that is required.p

Negative 368 pForwardInvocation does exist, but it is slow and has the annoying problem of compiler warnings.  So that got me to thinking  is there a way to use macroes to quickly implement a bunch of getter methods that get the property in question from another objectp  pFor example, if I have a Car object, it might want to implement the followingp  precodeCar.h  class SparkPlug class Engine  . . .  int nPistons float horsepower SparkPlug sparkPlug  Car.m  . . .  int nPistons      return self.engine.nPistons   float horsepower      return self.engine.horsepower   SparkPlug sparkPlug      return self.engine.sparkPlug  codepre  pQuestion  would it be possible to set up some macroes so that by making emoneem change somewhere, I could add another such method to both the header and implementation filesp  pe.g. MagicForwardingMacro nPistons, int, enginep  pIdeally, in such a way that the macroes would be reusable if I later wanted to later use a similar strategy to get the firstName, lastName, placeOfBirth, and dateOfBirth properties of a Person from his or her birthCertificate.p

Negative 368 pI have a problem I need to solve, but I cant think of any easy and more important fast solution. Its a bit like a part of a multiple traveling salesman problem.p  pFirst I have a matrix with codeXcode rows and codeNcode columns, codeNcode is a static variable of my algorithm and codeXcode can vary. Lets assume it looks like here codeN  5codep  precodematrix  [1 2 4 3 5 4 3 1 2 5 1 2 4 3 5 ] matrix   1     2     4     3     5  4     3     1     2     5  1     2     4     3     5 codepre  pevery row is seen as a route and contains all the unique numbers between 1 and codeNcode Each route  row will be split in partial routes. That means, I have a breakpoint matrix which contains codeXcode rows and codeMcode codeM lt Ncode columns. E.g.p  precodebreakpoints  [2 3 4 1 2 4 1 3 4] breakpoints   2     3     4  1     2     4  1     3     4 codepre  pThe indices of each row of codebreakpointscode give the elements of the corresponding row of codematrixcode AFTER which the route will be split into partial routes. Just to make clear, lets regard the frist row as an example codebreakpoints1,   2     3     4code which means, that the route codematrix1,   1     2     4     3     5code will be split into the partial routes code[1 2], [4], [3] and [5]code. The second row has the breakpoints codebreakpoints2,   1     2     4code which will split the second route codematrix2,   4     3     1     2     5code into the partial routes code[4], [3], [1 2] and [5]code.p  pNow my aim is to remove all rows from codematrixcode, whereas the partial routes are redundant duplicates, just in a different order. In this example row 2 is a duplicate of row 1. Row 3 is NO duplicate even if it has the same route as row 1, because there are different breakpoints which lead to the partial routes code[1], [2 4], [3] and [5]code.p  pHow could I do this cleanly and fast Matrix can contain many elements, like codeX  5e4code rows and codeN  10code, codeM  6code. p

Would this be an autosizing issue  I went through all of the NIBs and unchecked codeAutoresize Subviewcode for each one and then went through all of the images in each view and unchecked codeAutoresize Subviewcode and that seemed to resize the images so theyre smaller but still not staying in the bounds and sizing constraints of the codeUIImageViewscode that contain them.p  pAnyone have an idea of whats going onp  hr  h2Updateh2  hr  pHeres images of what the app looks like now after unchecking all of the codeAutoresize Subviewcode check boxesp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comr1sOA.pngimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlfZfq.png altafter uncheckingap  pThe sliders shouldnt be that close to the images either...p

Negative 368 pI feel embarrassed to ask this question as I feel like I should already know.

Specifically, I need to load CSV or really tab delimited files. p  pI am experimenting with codeCSVReadercode and specifically a hrefhttpwww.csvreader.comcodecsuploadcsv.php relnofollowthis code samplea but Im sure Im doing it wrong.

Negative 368 pemEven if this question is a year old, I am still searching a good answer for this question. I appreciate any information that will lead me to fully understand this issue regarding low performances of communicating web services hosted on the same machine.emp  pI am currently developing a system with several WCF Web Services that communicate intensively. They are running under IIS7, on the same machine, each service being in a different Application Pool, with multiple workers in the Web Garden.p  pDuring the individual evaluation of each Web Service, I can serve 1000020000 requests per minute, quickly and without any issues for the resource consumption processor and memory.p  pWhen I test the whole system or just a subsystem formed by two Web Services I cant serve more than 2000 requestsminute.  I also observed that communication time between Web Service is a big issue sometimes more than 10 seconds. But when testing with only 1000 requests per minute everything goes smoothly connection time of no more than 60 ms. I have tested the system both with SOAPUI and JMETER, but the times were computed based on system logs, not from the testing tools. Memory and network arent an issue they are used very little.p  pLater on, I have tested the performance of 2 communicating WCF web services, hosted on two server and on the same server. It again seems that there is a bottleneck when the services are on the same machine, lowering the number of connection with from ten thousands to thousands again, no memory or processor limiting.p  pAs a note, I am working with quite big data in some cases and some of the operations needed are long ones.p  pI used perf.mon to see whats going on, for memory, processes, webservice, aspnet, etc. but I didnt see anything that could indicate what its going wrong. I also tried all the performance settings and tuning options I could find on the Internet.p  pDoes someone know what can be wrong Why the communication between Web Services could last so long Why the Web Service which serves as an entry point in the system can accept 10000 requestsminute when is tested alone, but when communicating with another Web Service barely accepts 2000 Its an IIS7 problem Could my system perform better if each Web Service will be deployed on a different serverp  pI want to understand better how things internally function IIS and WCF services to improve performances for current and future systems.p

Negative 368 pThe idea behind is a multiplayer browser game which interacts with a PHP server.p  pRight now it works like this Every second the browser is doing an ajax call to the php script which checks everything and returns the response. All in all it runs fine, but the problem is that the browser gets overloaded because of thousands of ajax requests after a while and it becomes impossible to play anymore. Also the delay of 1 second is pretty much.p  pMy idea is to have a simple flash pixel which will have a 2way communication with the server. For examplep  ul liUser makes and actionli liJavascript function calls the flash pixel with some parametersli liThe flash sends the request to the serverli liThe server announce about this action to all other flash listeners users onlineli liThe response from the server is receivedli liUI updatedli ul  pSomething like that.p  pThe data which is sent and received can be just strings json or any other.p  pI read about different RTMP servers and also about a hrefhttpsmartfoxserver.com relnofollowsmartfoxserver.coma. It wouldnt be a problem to buy any of them, but in my eyes they are offering too much for my needs audio video streaming, etc.. Also they are not PHP based. So using an RTMP server would require it to start a PHP script when needed. This would be also not a problem until the user can play without lags.p  pIn case the solution would be to install a RTMP server, there is a a hrefhttpcode.google.compphprtmpclient relnofollowRTMP clienta in PHP, but unfortunately there isnt much informationdocumentation about it.p  pIn any case, if no solution is found, Im going to use the same Flash pixel which will send requests and receive responses via PHP AMF. It will have small delays and wont be persistent but it should solve a part of the problem.p  pMaybe some of you already had this problem and found a solution or any other ideas of how to realize this are welcome.p  pThank youp  pstrongP.S.strong Google Wave was using something similar in their interactive chat, when some user was typing and the other could see this in real time.p

Negative 368 pCould someone please help me with the code for below requirement or scenarios...I achieved 80 , but stuck up with autoformatting...Its silly but new for me p  pWell my business user would like to feature for a big amount field textbox which should allow 2 decimal points only.i.e when she types 1000, it should be automatically formatted as 1,000.00 and when she types 1000000, it should be like 1,000,000.00 and when she types 1K, it should be formatted as automatically 1,000.00 and when she types 10000.23 it should be 10,000.23 and Mm should be million and bB should be billion. Well I could achieve all these MM, kK etc and limitting the decimal only to 2 decimal points. Even I kept validation and all like it wont allow any characters except kK,mM,bB,. and ,. Please also remember, if user mentions just 2k, it should be 2,000.00 i.e I mean to say, if no values she keyin for decimal or no . in the number value in textbox, it should be that number.00 against to 23333.32 which should appear as 23,333.32p  pBut I have a problem of implementing autoformatting the inputs with a coma for interval of every 3 digits starting from first digit to the left of decimal place. I am not sure how to do this autoformatting for coma... This should happen only when the user finishes keying in the input and presses tab. Please help me achieve this  I would be really greatful if you can share the sample code for me like above. emPlease consider all scenarios I mentioned while we try for code for thisem  Meanwhile I will also workout ways to achieve this...I know it might look silly to you, but new for me  ....thank you all....p

Negative 368 pI hope this is a simple question. If I have a UINavigationController and I push a new view controller onto the stack with an animated transition, how can I detect when the animation has finished and the new view controller is on screen p  pI have a few scenarios where I need to push a new controller that then has to do a longrunning operation. Id like to push the new view first so theres something on screen before I start blocking the main thread for a long time. If I do the push immediately followed by my longrunning task the view wont show up until after both are done of course and the main thread is able to process events again. p  pSo, what Id like to do be able to detect in the new controller once the animation is done and the view is on screen, and then start the task. p

Negative 368 pIm faced with a curious problem in my current project p  pIve got multiple Spring MVC based web apps deployed on a Glassfish 3.1 server  and I need to be able to timeout the user based on the sesion timeout parameter in their respective web.xml  no matter in which application the user is on. Please dont ask why the applications are in separate WARs  the architecture is so. The user is logged in via WebApp A and is redirected to a WebApp B  and then the user can keep jumping to different web apps  I guess you get the idea. The WebAppB etc. have numerous Ajax calls Im not even going there as well. The question, I guess, boils down to the fact that Im not able to share session data between WebApp A and WebApp B I may be wrong here  and this is where I require help and so I dont have any way to know by checking  p  precodehttpServletRequest.getSessionfalse   codepre  pin WebAppB since it returns null in both cases when the first request hits the WebAppB and the first request after a session timeout. I have to keep something in the WebAppAs session and check for its existence in WebAppBs session  which brings me back to the issue of sharing session data within web applications. I cannot use DB storage, since that would mean a DB call on every request. I got a direction by googling that crossContext thing in Tomcat helps in such scenarios  but will something like this be helpful in Glassfish  theres a crossContextAllowed property for sunwebapp.xml which I recently found. p  pIve been stuck with this for quite some time now and Im not even sure this is a question worth your time  so thanks in advance for trying to help.p  pTrishulp

Negative 368 pIm implementing Comet with longpolling AJAX and ApachePHP. The problem is that if there is not interaction in a unknown for me period of time, ie, no data sentreceived, and then after some time, I send an event, the clientside longpolling request keeps pending without receiving the new data. Sometimes clientside receives a timeout and reconnects, but sometimes it doesnt receives anything and, as I already said, the request keeps pending. Im implementing it as indicated a hrefhttpwww.zeitoun.netarticlescometandphpstart relnofollowherea with some alterations unrelated to the comet implementation per se ie using database instead of file. It uses a loop on the serverside waiting for new events and seems that server timeout closes the connection but client doesnt receives the connection close for reconnecting. How can I avoid this problem Would the solution be using a clientside timer for reconnectingp

Negative 368 p The question below has been answered by Andrew Whitakers response great example. Basically you can use .getJSON.. to programatically fetch JSON data from a service such as YQL, noting that this service can be associated with a different domain i.e., not provided by the same domain from which the page was loaded. Normally, you cannot make such a request to a different domain and thus a trick is used in implementing the request where HTML is dynamically generated and inserted into the DOM and new crossdomain script is fetched and executed. In executing the returned script, it causes the JSON carried with it to be processed and your supplied callback function called. Because this technique blindly executes returned script, one must be careful of security concerns probably similar to loading any script. In order to enable the crossdomain ability, it is IMPORTANT in the provided getJSON url to include the option callback, which is picked up and removedmodified by jQuery as a signal to use the JSONP crossdomain calling technique. Note that this method of returning JSON data relies on serverside support of JSONP. Thanks again for all the help. p  pThe following code goes out to YQL and fetches the current stock price of IBM as an example. It works fine and does its task by loading a script file whose URL effectively causes the dynamic generation of JSON data, which upon loading and executing, causes topstories to be run and the price extracted. However, I would like to make this process based on an AJAX call .getJSON.. where I presume I separate out the url and data components from the below scriptbased example. Ive tried a lot of variations without successit doesnt seem like I can get the .getJSON.. call to call the callback function. Any thoughts would be appreciated. ...Ericp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml gt   ltheadgtlttitlegtYQLlttitlegt    ltstyle typetextcssgt     results width 40 marginleft 30 border 1px solid gray padding 5px height 200px overflow auto     ltstylegt   ltscript typetextjavascriptgt    Parses returned response    function topstorieso        var price  o.query.results.xmlapireply.finance.last.data       alertlast    price        Place price in div tag       document.getElementByIdresults.innerHTML  price    ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt    lt Div tag for stories results gt    ltdiv idresultsgtltdivgt    lt The YQL statment will be assigned to src. gt    ltscript srchttpquery.yahooapis.comv1publicyqlqselect2020from20google.igoogle.stock20where20stock3Dibm3Bampformatjsonampdiagnosticstrueampenvstore3A2F2Fdatatables.org2Falltableswithkeysampcallbacktopstoriesgtltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 368 pRecently I inherited a new ASP web application that merely allows customers to pay their outstanding invoices online.

Negative 368 pI need to handle the HTTP Response Splitting Issue for a ajax call through the XMLHTTPRequestResponse. I am using a filter for filtering the servlet request and response and have defined inner classes for the wrapper in which the methods are overridden to check for any presence of CRLF characters. Now I need to do the same for the AJAX request. The filter is configured in the web.xml. so every request and response can be tracked. This implementation is done and working fine. And I need to have the same implementation for this AJAX request and response. But I am not been able to find any java API to implement the same. Can any one have any suggestion or tips for this issue. Any implementation example is welcome. Thanks a lot in advance.p

If I change something at the front of the cleartext then only the front of the output is affected etc.. Can it be that somehow has to do with 8 or 16 Byte boundaries of byte strings and how could I fix this Is something misguiding me herep  pIndependent from the CTR mode it should be noticed that AES works with 4x4 byte arrays and the question is about the encryption of a single array. AES should to my understanding perform four rounds of mixing and the change of a single byte out of 16 should result in at least 50 of the bits  being different. Thus, it can in my opinion not be that changes at the end of a 16 byte cleartext change exactly the end of the cipher text and changes at the front change the front etc.. To my understanding the IV only comes into play as a counter when multiple 4x4 arrays are involved.p

Negative 368 pI wish to implement a program to monitor the GPS positions of multiple aircraft.

At the moment I can only think of have a table with 3 main fields ID of aircraft, TimeStamp increments by 1 after every update and the position.

What I want to share is position and rotation.p  pAs it is a videogame I dont want the main thread to be blocked or be just the minimum time possible and I dont want the performance to be affected.

Negative 368 pI am attempting to implement a character device driver for Linux and am having trouble. In short, data written to the device is buffered for reading. When no data is available, the call to read blocks via waiteventinterruptible. Data received by the write handler calls wakeupinterruptible. The release handler also calls wakeupinterruptible to unblock the reader but sets a flag to indicate the driver is releasing.p  pFrom user space I have an executable that opens the driver via open and then starts another thread. The main thread proceeds to call read. As intended, no data is available for reading and the call blocks. The other thread sleeps for one second providing sufficient time for the main thread to read and block, calls close and then calls close again. The first call returns 0 while the second returns 1 as expected. However, my drivers release handler is never called and I cannot understand how to unblock my reading thread without explicitly sending it a signal or writing some data to the device. My understanding is that when the last handle to the driver closes that its release handler is invoked. I am trying to implement what I believe is standard user space behavior a thread blocked reading from a file will become unblocked and receive an endoffile return value when asynchronously closed.p  pDo I have the correct understanding of readclose at the file level in user space Do I have the correct device driver understanding Am I missing something else I looked through Linux Device Drivers 3rd Edition and couldnt quite find an answer to this question. I have also searched Google but cannot seem to find the answer either. Any help you can provide is appreciated. My kernel version is 3.0.15.p

Negative 368 pWe have an MVC 3, .Net 4.0 application and a number of specflow tests in xunit that seem to be running with no problem. To be in full control of our test data, we want to setup a clean database at the beginning of each scenario and dispose of it afterwards. For that, we need to change the connection string on the fly before each scenario. Connections to the database are handled using NHibernate sessions and we used the following code to change the connection stringp  precodepublic class SessionFactoryProvider      private static ISessionFactory sessionFactory     public static ISessionFactory BuildSessionFactorybool resetConnection  false              if ConnectionString  null                      ConnectionString  ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConnectionString].ConnectionString                   if sessionFactory  null  resetConnection                      sessionFactory  Fluently.Configure                                .Mappingsx gt x.FluentMappings.AddFromAssemblyOfltInvoiceMapgt.Conventions.AddFromAssemblyOfltCascadeConventiongt                                .DatabaseMsSqlConfiguration.MsSql2008.ConnectionStringConnectionString                                .ExposeConfigurationUpdateSchema                                .CurrentSessionContextweb                                .BuildSessionFactory                  return sessionFactory       [BeforeScenario] public static void SetupDatabase              var connection  DBHandler.GetAcceptanceDatabaseConnection         SessionFactoryProvider.ConnectionString  connection.ConnectionString         var session  SessionFactoryProvider.BuildSessionFactorytrue.OpenSession       codepre  pBut it looks like the Specflow tests and the actual application are running as two different processes and they dont share the same sessionFactory although its defined as static. So changing the connection string in the SetupDatabase function changes the session of the specflow tests process not the connection string that the application process is using.p  ol liAre there any better methods for acceptance test data populationli liDoes our approach for switching connection strings make sense li liIs it possible for the Specflow tests to manipulate the session of the application itselfli ol

Negative 368 pThis is a MVC3 project using razor. Instead of displaying another view to inform the user that the changes have been saved successfully I would like to simply fire a JavaScript popup informing them...

The way Ive done it is as belowp  precodevar validator  frmSite.validate   onkeyup functionelement      var elementname  jQueryelement.attrname     if this.settings.rules[elementname]  undefined        if this.settings.rules[elementname].onkeyup  false          jQuery.validator.defaults.onkeyup.applythis, arguments               ,   rules      lttxtUsername.UniqueIDgt        onkeyup false,       required true,       minlength 6,                     remote function           var params             userName userNameTextbox.val                  return            type POST,           url servicessecurity.asmxUserNotExists,           data JSON.stringifyparams,           contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,           dataType json,           dataFilter function data              var msg  eval  data               if msg.hasOwnPropertyd               return JSON.stringifymsg.d             else               return msg           ,           error function jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown              alertjqXHR.responseText                                     codepre  pThe problem I have is that now that the remote rule is triggered on the codeonfocusoutcode event, whenever I click on something else in my page for example, the logout button the rule triggers. Ive added the codeonsubmit false,code as part of the options of the codevalidatecode function and a function to handle the click event of the submit button, but even with this the rule continues to trigger on the codeonfocusoutcode. To control this I added a function similar to the one I set for the codeonkeyupcode so the rules are not triggered on the codeonfocusoutcode either, but with this the only moment the user gets the validation message is after clicking on the submit button. However, I want to be able to notify the  user about the error as soon as possible i.e. as soon as he finished typing the username. Is there a way to do any or all of the followingp  ol liTo add a delay for the onkeyup so the rule is triggered some seconds after the user stopped typing in the username This should be in a way that affects only to the username textbox as I dont want the delay to affect the other inputs in the form.li ol  p1a. If the above is possible, can be set in a way the affects only to the coderemotecode rule So the coderequiredcode and codemaxlengthcode validations are triggered during normal keyup, but only the coderemotecode one is after some seconds the user stopped typing inp  ol liTo make the codeonkeyupcode event to trigger only for the coderequiredcode and codemaxlengthcode rules, but not for the coderemotecode one So the coderemotecode rule is triggered only when user clicks on submit, but the other two are triggered on normal codekeyupcodeli ol  pIf there is any other possible way out, please suggest.p  pThanks.p

Negative 368 pNow this is a question for which I searched a lot of places,did a lot of coding but still am very confused. I am new to Java,so I was writing this program which saves an object data as a serialized object. The data members are two Strings. I read that when an object is serialized and stored in a file,the whole object state is saved. True. Then also the data is in binary form which cannot be read by humans or normal text editors. So when i stored the object using writeObject,it saved the data successfully,but when i open the file, it contains a lot of gibberish data,with the strings dispersed within. If i see a little more carefully, i can make out the strings clearly. So are the strings nit transformed into something else like in case of numeralsp
Negative 368 pThis seems like it should be an obvious question, but I have had some issues finding a good answer.  I am building an ntier application that needs to be UTC time sensitive.  Values can be updated and when they are timestamps are recorded.  This includes transactions in the database where updates or inserts will impact datetime columns.p  pTo give some context I am using SQL 2008 R2  with DATETIMEOFFSET2 for most of my datetime columns.  I am considering putting the updates for timestamps into the Stored Procedures so that they do not need to be passed through the network.  This will save bandwidth as the system grows which is a good thing ... and can be used to validate if data changes first wins on shared data.  The down side is that the first to submit a transaction may not be the one who wins if they run into slower response time on their instance of the application.p  pWhat is the ideal or recommended way to handle UTC time data in this context  p  ol liSet it in the SPROC with SYSUTCDATETIME OR ...li liSet it in the application with DateTimeOffset.Now or DateTime.UtcNowli ol  pIf two above, would it be recommended to fire this at the Presentation Layer and pass it through the service to the domain layer or just set it when it hits the domain on the back end of the servicep  pAs you can see there are a lot of options here and I am leaning toward the database ... but I would appreciate any advice or words of warning before I continue building this thing out.p  pSide note  I am tracking geospatial info as well ... but this is not a hard realtime system.  User real time is more than adequate.p  pUPDATE I will be using DateTimeOffset in the applicaiton.  My research has lead me to uncover that you can reliably compare any tow DateTimes by first calling ToUniversalTime on each.  This strategy fails if and only if exactly one of them has a DatTimeKind of Unspecified.his potential for failure is another reason for favoring DateTimeOffset  C 4.0 In a Nutshell, ORiely books.p

Negative 368 pI have a RESTful API built with Spring 3.1, using Spring Security as well. I have a web application, also a Spring 3.1 MVC application. I am planning to have mobile clients accessing my REST API. So my API is the central place to authenticate, get data served from, etc.. It all makes sense so far.p  pNow what I cannot wrap my head around is how to add Spring Social in an easy and smart way. How did you do it Did you maybe only move the ConnectionRepository to the API Or did you have the API do it all I want to prevent doubleauthorization for each clienttechnology by all means preventing doubleauthorization meaning userA connects to facebook in the webapp, and then starts using our mobile client and should NOT be asked to connect to facebook again just bc userA is using a different client.p  pThanks for sharing your thoughtsp

Negative 368 pIn my .hgignore file, I am trying to ignore all generated xll files.  I unfortunately have a directory called xll within the domain of the repository, and I do emnotem want to ignore the directory itself.p  pI have triedp  precodesyntax regex .xll codepre  pwhich I thought should mean match all that ends in .xll andp  precodesyntax regex ..xll codepre  pwhich I thought should mean match all that have at least one arbitrary character, followed by .xll.p  pWith either of the above, the directory is not ignored yay but neither is a file foobar.xll darn.  If I use a bare xll with regex, or .xll with glob, embothem the directory and the file are ignored.p  pThis is in linux Ubuntu 10.04.4 with hg 2.6 TortoiseHG 2.8 Im observing the effect in Nautilus via the presence or absence of X icons.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT adding comments in here as they are too long to fit in a comment... Thanks for all the responses.  Turns out I was misinterpreting some things.  So  because I used regex instead of regexp and I had glob at top of file, whatever I put on the line that referred to xll was being interpreted by glob, so the line did have an effect which made me think, incorrectly, that the syntax regex line was doing what I thought it was  by coincidence, all the files in my xll directory were filtered out as they should have been by other lines in .hgignore, and not by the .xll line  consequently, in Nautilus, the xll directory was marked as ignored, not because the filter ignoring the entire directory, but instead because other filters were filtering emallem files within that directoryp  pBottom line, the .xll I had under syntax glob was actually filtering out files exactly as desired.  The feedback in Nautilus was just different than I expected.p

Negative 368 pIf I get an initial Name or service not known EAINONAME, the next call to getaddrinfo seems to go straight to the dns instead of checking the cache first nscd logs show no lookup attempts, tcpdump shows traffic to DNS server. If the first call succeeds in getting an address, from then on, all getaddrinfo calls go to nscd first, as expected.p  pIm compiling against glibc2.13 for arm linux. In my rc.d, nscd is started before my daemon. nscd is set to disallow shared caches, and maintain a host cache. I am using the nscd from busybox 0.47. nsswitch.conf is set so host checks cachefilesdns. hosts.conf is set to check filesbind.p  pMy daemon is calling getaddrinfo.p  pI have debug logs for nscd running, and they show that the client started to read the DNS response closes with a Broken Pipe error. p  pAfter that it will show GAI attempts from other daemons attempting to use the cache so I know its not nscd locked up or anything, but the daemon that got EAINONAME never again contacts nscd to do a cache lookup.p  pIf I restart the daemon, I get the same behaviour, emifem the first DNS query times out again.p  pIs there something in glibc that is invalidating my daemons link to the cache Is there a way to reconnect my daemon to the cache without restarting it similar to forcing a resolv.conf reload via resinitp
Negative 368 pIve watched the RailsCast, another nested attributes video, lots of SO posts, and fought with this for a while, but I still cant figure it out. I hope its something tiny.p  pI have two models, codeUsercode created by Devise, and codeLockercode aka, a product wishlist, and Im trying to create a codeLockercode for a codeUsercode when they sign up.

My codeLockercode model has three attributes  codenamecode, codedescriptioncode not mandatory, and codeuseridcode to link it back to the codeUsercode.

This is simply means that no one else should tamper the information once its being transmitted once the submit button is clicked, nor anyone could forge or create a fake value spoofing the server.p  pThis theory leads to digital signature, where again in theory I should somehow sign the POSTed value using server PUBkey, then hash the POSTed value using the server PUBkey and finally send both the original POSTed value along with the hashed value.p  pPrior sending the POSTed value, the client MUST request for the server PUBkey, so the client can hash the POSTed value. The server could probably store the PUBkey information along with SESSION information.p  pThen the server will have to again hash this time with the server PRIkey the original POSTed value sent by client and compare the two hashed value. If those value is the same, it simply means it is authentic. p  pNow the part which I am yet to understand is the HOW.....p  pis there any toolsframeworkspluginstutorialexample on how to do this since it would be too much for me not to mention the limited amount of time I have for developing the whole PublicKeyInfrastructure from scratchp

Negative 368 pI have an embedded linux setup generated using buildroot. As part of my application I have a dedicated thread that opens the serial port devttyS0 for the purposes of listening for and replying to modbus messages. It works fine, but when my target device is connected to my host development machine, whenever I shutdown my dev machine, something is being sent over the serial port that is killing my process on the target. In this case I believe that it is the SAK secure attention key being received which results in SAK kernel messages and process being killed. I posted a hrefhttpunix.stackexchange.comquestions80857myprocesswaskilledbuticannotunderstandthekernelnoticethis questiona on unixlinux stackexchange and the answer to it partially helps me. The problem is that when I disable the serial port SAK usingp  precode setserial devttyS0 sak codepre  pat system startup, when I later open the port using userspace API C code the serial port is opened with the SAK option again I have verified this by disabling SAK, starting up my application, checking codesetserialcode again only to find SAK set once more. Basically, I need to know what flags I need to set in my codetermioscode struct that I pass to codetcsetattrcode when I am configuring the serial port. Currently my code that opens the serial is as followsp  precodeint currentfd  openstrfile.cstr, ORDWR  ONOCTTY  ONONBLOCK termios newsettings tcgetattrcurrentfd, ampoldoptions tcgetattrcurrentfd, ampnewsettings  newsettings.ccflag  0 newsettings.ccflag  CLOCAL  CREAD  CS8 newsettings.clflag  0 newsettings.coflag  0 newsettings.coflag  ONOCR  ONLRET   newsettings.ciflag  0 newsettings.ciflag  IGNBRK  IGNPAR  IGNCR     tcsetattrcurrentfd, TCSANOW, ampnewsettings codepre  pI have read through all of the codetermioscode man pages and I cannot see anything that refers to the SAK  the only relevent thing is the codeIGNBRKcode setting which I have set. Is there anything I can do to disable the SAK setting on the serial port via the userspace APIp

Such as h2.alt,h3,h4.alth4.  It cant be actual code.p  pThanksp

Pending some investigation, its the AJAX calls made to an API located on another, external server.

Negative 368 pI am converting from one ORM to another LLBGen Pro to Entity Framework.  In order to properly refactor I need to understand something.  In LLBGen Pro theres a concept called a hrefhttpwww.llblgen.comdocumentation2.6Using20the20generated20codeSelfServicinggencodeprefetchpaths.htm relnofollowprefetch pathsa. Prefetch paths exists in order to reduce the number of queries required in cases where lazy loading negatively impacts performance.  In Gen Pro, lets say I have 50 orders and I want to gather the customer related to each order.  With lazy loading I could end up with 51 DB queries.  1 for the orders and 50 more for each customer due to the lazy loading of customers vs just 2 queries with prefetch paths enabled.p  pMy understanding is that entity framework or perhaps LINQ to SQL generates the most optimum SQL for the situation.  Is Entity Framework somehow smart enough to optimize the queries in such a case where LLB Gen Pro cannot  In other words, does entity framework generate the SQL at runtime intelligently where it can look ahead and see the need for all customers and generate a single query rather than 50 individual queries  Or, does EF support some type of prefetch path or does this require some advanced custom expression trees...etcp

Negative 368 pWe are doing some summer clean up on our code base.p  pWe have found we are using both openssl openssl ... functions and mcrypt mcrypt ... functions for some light weight encryption.p  pI am by no means an expert on encryption, but both our openssl and mcrypt use appears to be AES256.p  pSince we are in the process of removing a number of unused  redundant extensions php extensions that is... We would like to remove either mcrypt or openssl.p  pWhat one is recommended Should we convert everything over to openssl or mcryptp  pEncryption  decryption takes place in about 0.51 of requests. We would prefer whatever one of the two is faster.p  pThanksp

Negative 368 pIntro  I am writing an app which displays a list of custom QWidgets namely, ScopeWidget in a container widget with VBoxlayout ScopeView.p  pEvery scopeWidget has a pointer to an own data source class Scope. These objects are logically arranged in groups, i.e. there are some shared parameters ScopeShared among objects in one group.   These parameters are needed when retrieving or preparing the data which has to be displayed on a scopeWidget. p  pOne step further  A scopeWidget needs two sets of parameters these given by Scope and given by ScopeGroup.  A scopeWidget can, by user action, change some of the shared parameters in a group, thus invalidating all previous retrieved data, held by Scopes in this group.   By default, there is no displayable data in a Scope. Data is retrieved on demand  when a paintEvent occurs this is the source of the problem. To get displayable data in a Scope, one have to process all Scopes in this particular group which yields usable data for all Scopes in the group. p  pHow it works  The user forces one of the scopeWidgets to change shared data in a group. After making these changes, all data held by Scopes in this group, is invalidated, so the change event reprocesses the whole group. And calls update for all scopeWidgets in this group. Widgets are redrawn. This worksp  pThe problem  is a paintEvent which occured spontanously. When the user changes something  Iknow that this happened and I can process the scopeGroup prior to enqueuing updates of widgets. But when something else the system itself executes a paint event, Ineed to process the whole group before any painting happens.   So the paint event does no painting directly, but executes scopeGroup processing, and after that, it paints the widget which had the painting event, and calls update for all other widgets in that group  which in turn causes new paint events, which cause a next scopeGroup processing, one paint, and updates for other widgets, which causes new paint events  it ends up as recursive repaint and scopeGroup processingp  pLame solution  flags  spontaneous paint events do group processing, one paint for the requesting widget, and updates on the rest of widgets in the group, together with setting flags for every widget.p  pThis pseudocode depicts this mechanismp  precodepaintEventQWidget w    ifwgtflag    wgtpaint wgtflag0    else    wgtgroupgtprocess  wgtpaint  QWidget x  foreachx,group ifxw  xgtflag1 xgtupdate    codepre  pWhat would be IMHO betterp  pa if widgets could be painted without a prior paint event or call to update or repaint  this would be the best ], but it doesnt work in the straightforward and obvious way  is there any other way  orp  pb force the system to call a custom function instead the paint eventp  pAre these better solutions possiblep

Negative 368 pSo I have been building a text based game in python as a project for learning python, implementing things as I learn them, so I started getting this error in some cases, I have been developing this game on a raspberry pi, on a machine running mint 13 and on an android tablet.

Negative 368 pFirst some explanationp  pI am attempting to make what should be a simple strongofflinestrong character generator for a game I am working on. I am using VB for this and I am still a beginner. I have created a WinForms application in VS 2012 and created a local database object to hold various data. Within the database I have a Players table to hold all the data. I have also added a BindingNavigator to the form, yet I removed all but the add and delete buttons as navigation is controlled by a List control which is bound to the PlayersBindingSource. I also added a save button to the BindingNavigator.p  pI manually populated the Players table with two example entries to work with and, when the form loads, the listBox displays the two entries by their Player Name field correctly. When one is selected all the controls representing each field change accordingly. If I change any values and hit the save button, it emseemsem to work with the code Im using.p  pNow the problemsp  pWhen the add button is pressed, it makes a new entry in the ListBox, yet none of the default values specified are showing up. If I edit this entry and then hit save it seems to update fine. However, if I make any other changes to any of the entries and try to save, it throws an exception.p  pWhen the delete button is pressed, the entry disappears from the list as expected, but again, if I try to save, I get an exception.p  phere is the code that is in my form thus far not muchp  precodePublic Class frmMain      Private Sub frmMainLoadsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles MyBase.Load         Me.PlayersTableAdapter.FillMe.DatPlayerDataSet.Players     End Sub      Private Sub SaveToolStripButtonClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles SaveToolStripButton.Click         Me.Validate         Me.PlayersBindingSource.EndEdit         Me.TableAdapterManager.UpdateAllMe.DatPlayerDataSet     End Sub End Class codepre  pAlso, if I look at the data contained in the Players table, the two example entries remain unchanged, and no additional entries are added, so I dont think the edits were never actually committed to the table.p  pIf anyone can help me with this, or could even simply provide a link to some tutorials that would help me, I would be highly appreciative. I have browsed this site, and microsofts msdn library, searching for information about data binding and navigation, yet I couldnt seem to find anything that helped.p

Negative 368 pI have downloaded the FreeRDP project from a hrefhttpwww.freerdp.com relnofollowhttpwww.freerdp.coma. I have tried to import the android project after removing the .cmake extension for the XMLs and PROPERTIES files. I tried importing and resulted with a build error, a NullPointerException in ECLIPSE IDE. I have the latest Eclipse IDE with ADT and Android SDK. p  pPlease help me run this project on android client and windows server. There is a readme file for android, which I read and never understood what I actually have to do. p  pstrongThe README filestrongp  precodeOverview   The FreeRDP Android port consists of two parts the Android Java GUI clientAndroid  and the JNI bindings clientAndroidjni which are written in C and wrap FreeRDP to  be used with Java. The JNI is directly integrated within FreeRDPs build system. For building the GUI part there are three possibilities   integrated ant build  have cmake to operate ant and build everything  manual ant build  build JNI with cmake and invoke ant manually for the GUI  IDE builds using your favourite IDE  use cmake for building JNI and your IDE for GUI  Manual build and IDE build are mostly used for development.   Build requirements   For the Android port some additional dependencies need to be fulfilled   for JNI  Android NDK gt r9  prebuild static openssl libraries see below   for the Java GUI if build with ant  ant  Android SDK  version gt 21  FreeRDP requires openssl libraries for building but they are not part of the  Android NDK and therefore they need to be prebuild manually. Multiple source versions and builds of static openssl libraries are floating around. At the time of writing we have tested and used httpsgithub.combmiklautzAndroidexternalopensslndkstatic. However, any other static build should work as well.  To build openssl  git clone gitgithub.combmiklautzandroidexternalopensslndkstatic.git cd androidexternalopensslndkstatic ndkbuild  found in the Android NDK   Building   Integrated build   Run the following commands in the top level freerdp directory. Dont forget to set ANDROIDNDK, ANDROIDSDK and FREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATH to the absolut paths on your machine  cmake DCMAKETOOLCHAINFILEcmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  DANDROIDNDKyourndkpathhere  DFREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATHyoursslbuildrootpath  DANDROIDSDKyoursdkpathhere make  After that you should have a clientAndroidbinaFreeRDPdebug.apk.  Manual ant builds  First run cmake to prepare the build and build JNI. Dont forget to set ANDROIDNDK, ANDROIDSDK and FREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATH to the absolut paths on your machine  cmake DCMAKETOOLCHAINFILEcmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  DANDROIDNDKyourndkpathhere  DFREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATHyoursslbuildrootpath  DANDROIDSDKyoursdkpathhere DANDROIDBUILDJAVAOFF make  Now you can run your favourite ant command in clientAndroid like this  cd clientAndroid ant debug install  Using an IDE  Here is an example on how to use Eclipse for developingbuilding the Java GUI. For this the Android development tools for Eclipse are required available via the eclipse marketplace.  cmake DCMAKETOOLCHAINFILEcmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  DANDROIDNDKyourndkpathhere  DFREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATHyoursslbuildrootpath  DANDROIDBUILDJAVAOFF make  Open Eclipse and choose File gt Import gt General gt Existing Projects into Workspace  Browse to the clientAndroid directory in your FreeRDP folder and click finish. If you get something like Project aFreeRDP is missing required source  folder gen just build the project once and you are good to go.  Side note If you add G Eclipse CDT4  Unix Makefiles when running cmake you can also import FreeRDP into Eclipse too. Then you have one Java project and one cc project you can work on. This requires CDT to be installed in Eclipse.   cmake variables   JNI related   CMAKETOOLCHAINFILE  the toolchain file to use must be cmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  ANDROIDNDK used from toolchain file  absolute path to the NDK  ANDROIDABI used from toolchain file  Android ABI to build for default is armeabiv7a  FREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATH used by FindOpenSSL  absolut root path to the prebuild static openssl libraries  WITHDEBUGANDROIDJNI  enable debugging for JNI  The libraries must be located in objlocalarmeabi or objlocalarmeabiv7a. Cmake searches in armeabi first then armeabiv7a. It is possible to build FreeRDP for armeabiv7a and link against armeabi openssl but not the other way around. Therefore it is suggested to build openssl for armeabi.  Java GUI related   ANDROIDBUILDJAVA used by clientAndroidCMakeLists.txt  can be ONOFF default OFF whether or not to build the GUI with cmake  ANDROIDSDK used by clientAndroidCMakeLists.txt  absolute path to the Android SDK to use  This is used to generate local.properties needed by ant. Needs to be set if you build manually with ant or do integrated builds.   Development   Updating JNI headers   Whenever the FreeRDP API changes or you need some extra functionality in your Java GUI the JNI needs to be updated. The JNI headers are generated from the compiled Java classes   edit clientAndroidsrccomfreerdpafreerdpservicesLibFreeRDP.Java to    reflect your changes  build the Android Java project as described above  run .scriptsregenerateJNIheaders.sh from your FreeRDP checkout top level   directory  After that you need to implement the functionality in clientAndroidjniandroidfreerdp.c and add the call to clientAndroidjnigeneratedandroidfreerdpjni.c. After that FreeRDP and the Android package need to be rebuilt to include the latest libfreerdpandroid in the package.  Android CMake related Variables   ANDROIDAPPTARGETSDK         ... specifies the desired android target SDK, currently 11 ANDROIDAPPMINSDK            ... specifies the minimum android SDK version supported, currently 8 ANDROIDAPPGOOGLETARGETSDK  ... specifies the minimum google SDK requirement, currently 16 codepre  pIf someone has worked with this FreeRDP project before, please guide me, thanks in advance...p

However, consider download times   when determining your apps size. Minimize the files size as much as   possible, keeping in mind that there is a 50 MB limit for overtheair   downloads. Abnormally large binary files are usually the result of   storing data, such as images, inside the compiled binary itself,   instead of as a resource inside your app bundle.

Negative 368 pI have a problem with multiple lines tracking by using Kalman filter. Input data  number of items and set of structures with x1,y1, x2,y2 coordinates. For each iteration the number of items can be different so some lines can appear or disappear.p  pFor single line it looks simple  we have input data, equasions etc. and we can create output. We always know the line can exist. If not, and it will appear later  it will be still the same line.p  pBut for multiple lines I dont know how to start  in one iteration I can get few objects  ok, I will use this set of equasions for each of them. But in next iteration I can get less of more lines. Im not sure whats the correct approach  I have data from previous iteration but I will need to use it for the same object. So 1. I need to find it  checking distance between middlepoints for pair estimated previously lt line N and choosing the smallest value Is it correct approach or we have different method 2. Storing old data  the line was visible long time but after next iteration will never appear. I got new line and again  the same situation. It will be good to store old results but in this case, after looong time, I will have a lot of zombiedata. Do we have some special criteria to clean it or I need to use some own ideas like max iterations if no detection etc.p

Negative 368 pIm developing a iOS application and id like to check if a specific user is online or not. My first idea was to send cyclically at a distance of five seconds asynchronous connections from the application to a php page that updates a field in the database by inserting the current date and time. Then, to see if a particular user is online, the application fetch this data from the database every 5 seconds and compare it with the current time if current time is greater than data collected greater than 5 seconds, it means that the user is offline , otherwise it is online. This works but surely the instant messaging applications do not use this method because it is too expensive. Which approach should be usedp  pI hope i explained myself, thank youp

Negative 368 pIm working with a database schema that our company has used for years, and am not in a position to change the fundamental structure of it. The need for an API to access this data came up, so we decided to go with WCF Data Services and the Entity Framework. In order to have a data model that made more sense than our table structure, we have our EF models attached to SQL Views instead of tables. This has worked really well for our purposes.p  pNow Im in a situation where Im considering creating a second updated version of our API, while needing the existing API to continue to work for old applications, and having the two APIs running sidebyside, accessed via different URL endpoints.p  pIve created a new WCF Data Service endpoint for the new version, new SQL views as necessary the names of which have v2 appended to them, and a new DB Context that maps the models to the new views. This also works well.p  pThe hiccup is that Id like to also have separate versions of the EF model classes, as Id like implement slight differences into them. But I run into the naming conflict, where the EF framework gives the error mapping of CLR type to EDM type is ambiguous.p  pThe only way to have a second set of EF models with the same names is by having the models be loaded from a separate assembly. Is that my only option here Is there some other approach I should considerp  pIve also considered using the same EF model classes for both versions, and using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydn23719228vvs.11329.aspx relnofollowIgnorea method when configuring the models, but this also doesnt feel ideal.p  pAny suggestions on alternative approaches appreciatedp

Negative 368 pI had been thinking of using a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12628251javafactorypatternwithgenericsgeneric factory patterna for this, however I just want to make sure that I am using it correctly.p  pFirst of all, this has to be Javabased, due to client needs.p  pMy application can instantiate several objects, and each of those objects should be able to change type at run time.  For instance, a variable can start out as a float, be converted to an int, then to a char, then back to a float.  That would be a basic example, however custom data types can be added in for extra fun.p  pIs a generic factory pattern the correct one to use in this case  Or, is there something better  To me, the factory pattern seems to be better at instantiating and not updating unless if I essentially destroyed and reinstantiated the variable.p  hr  pMore detailp  pThis is an evolutionary algorithm where I dont necessarily know the types when the program starts.  It may find that an int is more desirable than a float, based on how evolution goes.p  pFor instance, if I start with a floating point value of 4.34p  precode start of program object var  4.34   evolution running...... ...   evolution determines that var would be better as a float var.convertToInt   var is now an int with a value of 4 codepre  pMy initial thought had been to have a generic factory type object where I keep track of the current type of the object and return the appropriate value.  So in the beginning it would return a codefloatcode, and after the conversion would return the intconverted value mapped to an internal codeintcode.p  hr  pEdit 2 Code clarification.p  pI guess my point is just not coming through.  Here is an example of what I would expect to see, codewise.  p  precodeobject var  new objectint, 4     create int variable with value of 4  where object is whatever base design pattern i am using here ... var.toFloat                       convert var to float, value is now 4.0 System.out.printlnvar.getValue  prints 4.0 ... var.toCustomClass                 var is now a custom datatype System.out.printlnvar.getValue  calls the print method of the class codepre  pI should also mention that the instance of codevarcode needs to persist throughout execution, as it is an object within my evolutionary algorithm and cant be destroyed and reinstantiated as something else.p

Negative 368 pI am working on a web app, and I have considered hiding or display some contentoptions using CSS or stamping it in dynamically using an AJAX requests as needed. However, I can also stamp everything in at the time of load and just use CSS to hide or display the content as needed.I know it can mean a busier DOM, but it seems like CSS would be snappier than an AJAX request. What are the pros and cons of this Your recommendations would be greatly appreciated as well as explanations about why you recommended what you recommended.p

Negative 368 pIm using a Raspberry Pi and im working on a car computer project. Im building the interface with pygame, and the thougt of a GPS system just hit me and would be awesome. So Im just checking if this some how is possible, or if someone knows about a similar project.p  pIve spent some time googeling but not found anything thats interesting. I know that  Google maps has a pretty neat GPS service, but then i would need to have some kind of web browser in my pygame project to render the maps  I guess theres nothing like this, huhp  pMaybe I could reach the Google API some how and just get the directions and all that but no maps. That is, just display text with in 200 meters turn right for example. Not spent any time checking it out, I thougt it was best to check for ideas and tips here first. p  pHas enyone else done anything similar to this Any good tips or ideas Streamed or locally stored maps does not matter. The Pi will have internet access through wifi to hotspot on my phone. Yes, its easier to just let the phone guide me, but teres no fun in that.p

Negative 368 pIm looking for some help on the best way to handle API Logging. Id like to log all requests and responses to either sql or to a textfile if thats the best way. Currently Ive been inserting a row into a logs table in SQL Server. I do that with a static method called LogAction, and I run it near the end of every Controller in my Web API. I also log exceptions that are caught as well. Is there a way to do this with an MVC Web API natively, or am I on the right track p  pCurrently it looks just like thisp  precode Log API Call System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer x  new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializerrequest.GetType StringWriter s  new StringWriter x.Serializes, request Utilities.LogActionUtilities.LogType.MAIN, false, response.ToString, s.ToString, MainController Successful codepre  pIs there a way to get it to log all API actions natively This feels wrong to me because if something happened between this static method and actually returning the response, then this log is no longer valid. What is the most effective way to log API actions p

Negative 368 pI have a csv file with nearly 200000 rows containing two columns name amp job. The user then inputs a name, say username, and I have to search the entire csv to find the names that contain the pattern username and finally print the output to screen. I have implemented this using ArrayList in Java where I put the entire names from csv to ArrayList and then searched for the pattern in it. But in that case the overall time complexity for searching is On. Is there any other data strucure in Java that I can use to perform the searching in ologn or something more efficient than ArrayList I cant use any database approach by the way. Also if there is a good data structure in any other language that I can use to accomplish my goal, then kindly suggest it to mep  pEdit The output should be the names in the csv that contains the pattern username as the last part. Eg If my input is son, then it should return jackson,etc. Now what I have done so far is read the name column of csv to a string ArrayList, then read each element of the ArrayList and using the regular expression patternmatcher of Java to see if the element has the username as the last part. If yes, then print it. If I implement this in a multithreaded environment, will it increase the scalability and performance of my program p

When they are done, they click the Logout button, and it logs out of the account and quits the webdriver instance.p  pWhat Im trying to provide is a way for them to log into multiple accounts at once, while still maintaining the ability to click one of the clients names that they are logged into, process the logout on that account, and close that browser instance. p  pOne thing I was hoping is to be able to control the webdriver by either a process ID, or unique ID, in which I can store in a dictionary linking it to that client, so when they click the clients name in the app, and press logout, it uses something in PyQT like clientname  self.listitem.currentItem.text to get the name of the client they have selected which Im already using for other things, too, finds the unique ID or process ID, and sends the logout command to that instance, and then closes that instance.p  pThis may not be the best way to go about doing it, but its the only thing I could think of.p  pEDIT I also know that you can retrieve the Selenium sessionid with driver.sessionid considering your webdriver instance is assigned as driver, but i have seen nothing so far on being able to control a webdriver instance by this sessionid.p  pEDIT2 Here is an incredibly stripped down version of what I havep  precodefrom selenium import webdriver from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore   class ClientAccountManagerQtGui.QMainWindow      def initself          superClientAccountManager, self.init          grid  QtGui.QGridLayout          Creates the list box         self.clientlist  QtGui.QListWidgetself           Populates the list box with owner data         for name in clientnames.itervalues             item  QtGui.QListWidgetItemname             self.clientlist.addItemitem           Creates the login button         loginbtn  QtGui.QPushButtonLogin, self         loginbtn.connectloginbtn, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.login           Creates the logout button         logoutbtn  QtGui.QPushButtonLogout, self         logoutbtn.connectlogoutbtn, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.logout       def loginself           Finds the owner info based on who is selected         clientname  self.clientlist.currentItem.text         clientusername, clientpassword  getcredentialsclientname           Creates browser instance         driver  webdriver.Firefox           Logs in         driver.gethttpswww.....comlogin.php         driver.findelementbyiduserNameId.sendkeysclientusername         driver.findelementbyidpasswordId.sendkeysclientpassword         driver.findelementbycssselectorinput[typesubmit].click       def logoutself           Finds the owner info based on who is selected         clientname  self.clientlist.currentItem.text           Logs out         driver.gethttpswww....comlogout.php           Closes the browser instance         driver.quit   def main      app  QtGui.QApplicationsys.argv     cpm  ClientAccountManager     cpm.show     sys.exitapp.exec   if name  main     main codepre

Negative 368 pMy site works fine, no problems, in live Paypal mode using real money and real paypal accounts, so I know my listeners work, but despite trying every option and there are so many Ive found, I cant get the sandbox to work at all, to thoroughly test as needed. For instance, Id like to test echecks and lots of other options Im not familiar with live.p  pFor the sandbox, We are told to change the posting address to sandbox.paypal.com .... but even this is a bit vague in the Paypal documentation, although I assume and have changed it in all of my submitted website form, my IPN handler and my return page for the PDT handling.p  pThen we are told, again somewhat vaguely, to create development accounts. Ive done that, a buyer and a seller, both verified.p  pThen we are told, elsewhere, maybe, that its necessary to login to your development account as you test your page in the Sandbox, although Im still not clear if this is absolutely necesssary and which incidentally is again vague, because its possible to use your normal business login and get to the development page through Paypal Developer site, without logging in specifically to one of your created sandbox accounts which is a separate login. But Ive mainly assumed you need to be in a specific Sandbox created account, with the separate login from your normal Paypal one, but maybe its just the development page with my normal paypal login thats required None seem to work anyway.p  pSo then you have the issue if it is an issue  I just dont know  if you DO have to login in to a created Sandbox account as you test sending your form to sandbox.paypal, which one The one you pay with when the paypal payment page comes up on your site, the one that is set up as a seller account, the one which is referenced as your business in your input form Are there any requirements for all this. Then, which account needs to be on my form as my business  my real or my test seller, which account do I login to on the Sandbox as I test and which account do I buy with, because if I buy from my sandbox buying account, it will change my paypal session if Ive used the selling account or my real account to login to the sandbox.p  pI dont even know if any of these login issues are issues  they only seem like issues because I cant get the sandbox to work and Ive tried each combination multiple times.p  pIve also seen that you maybe need to have input typehidden nametestipn value1 in your submitted form, so again, its meant testing each possibility with and without that.p  pThen someone says it only works on certain ports e.g. 80 or 443, and not others, so you test each login combination, with the testipn option, with the port options ... still nothing with the Sandbox.p  pSo, does anybody know  are there any rules which are required to be followed other than changing the posting addresses I assume all of them  your form and your handlers to a hrefhttpswww.sandbox.paypal.comcgibinwebscr relnofollowhttpswww.sandbox.paypal.comcgibinwebscra ... etc. p  pIm thinking of rules about needing to log in to a Sandbox account, so which account, if any, you should login into on the Sandbox as you test your form it seems obvious it should be the seller account but that creates a conflict when I then login as a buyer on my paypal form, which one you buy from and which one is declared as your business on the form, bearing in mind that one may overwrite the session of the other and using all the same hasnt worked for me. Are there specific ports required Do we have to use the testipn field in the form or are there any other requirements Ive overlooked which Paypal doesnt properly explain, because its just about driving me crazy and the Paypal documentation really isnt fit for purpose.p

Negative 368 pIm trying to use an codeImageReadercode to get RGB images from the camera. Im using the Camera2 API from Android 5.0 L on a Nexus 5 running the developer preview.p  pI already have a codeSurfaceViewcode configured for RGB images which is working fine, and I know that the camera hardware produces RGB data because all the tone mapping and color gain settings on Android are specified to operate on RGB channels.p  pI can obtain YUV420888 images from ImageReader by creating the ImageReader this wayp  precodeimageReader  ImageReader.newInstanceW, H, ImageFormat.YUV420888, 4 codepre  pand then converting the YUV images to RGB. However, this is introducing both an unwanted quantization error since my application requires RGB images, and unnecessary processing time.p  pHowever, when I try creating the image reader this wayp  precodeimageReader  ImageReader.newInstanceW, H, PixelFormat.RGB888, 4 codepre  pthe image capture fails with the following exceptionp  precodejava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException The producer output buffer format 0x22 doesnt match the ImageReaders configured buffer format 0x3.         at android.media.ImageReader.nativeImageSetupNative Method         at android.media.ImageReader.acquireNextSurfaceImageImageReader.java293         at android.media.ImageReader.acquireNextImageImageReader.java339         at android.media.ImageReader.acquireLatestImageImageReader.java243         at ltmy code...gt codepre  pIm confused on two fronts. First, the output format mentioned, 0x22, is not in either PixelFormat or ImageFormat. It seems to be some sort of undocumented raw mode, but I cant use codeImageReader.newInstanceW, H, 0x22, 4code to capture it I get codejava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException Invalid format specified 34code. I would love to capture in the raw format but I cant convince ImageFormat to accept it and the other raw format codeImageFormat.RAWSENSORcode is incredibly slow for some reason.p  pSecond, the codeSurfaceViewcode is already happily consuming codeRGB888code images as far as I can tell, and putting them directly on the screen. So why isnt codeImageReadercode not accepting RGB images properly What did I do wrongp

Lowest Importance  will be the first one to be removed from memoryli ol  pI have to give a seminar for this topic, it goes without saying that I need to give example for each of the above 5 cases.p  pI am having a hard time for coming up with an example for strongBackground Processstrong.p  pSo for an app to be categorized as Background Process by the Android OS then there should not be any interaction with the user and a thread should be running.p  pThe thing is I am not able to come up with a proper convincing example for Background Process.p  pCan some one help me out p  pstrongEditstrong Only for those people who think this topic is not related in any way to memory managementp  pThis is how Android OS assigns memory to app if there is not enough memory by removing app based on above categories, I believe it comes under memory management.p

Negative 368 pHi I have a question with regards to the efficiency of iterating through a list of values.p  pI am wondering say you have to look through a list of values pulling out those values that match your current search criteria, does it make sense to remove the match you have found once you have found it, resulting in a smaller list of values to search through on the next iteration. Or does this make little difference. Here is my code.p  precodeforeach Project prj in projectList                      string prjCode  prj.Code              var match  usersProjects.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.Code  prjCode             if match  null                              usersProjects.Removematch                 More logic here                       codepre  pBasically I am searching for a project code that corresponds to a user from a list of all projects.

Negative 368 pI am reading multiple data files of varying length using struct.unpack. It works fine for files around 200MB, but gives MemoryError in struct.unpack when the size of files exceed 200MB. A related discussion at a hrefhttpbugs.python.orgissue14596 relnofollowhttpbugs.python.orgissue14596a mentioned that the struct.unpack works fine for same length of data files, and it produces memory leaks if the data files are of different length. I further tested multiple files of same size which accumulate upto 2GB, and it works fine.p  pSo, what is the solution for reading multiple files of varying length using struct.unpackp  pThank you Sabihp

But when arriving in the WCF method itself this authentication is gone. resulting in access exceptions from Sitecore as anonymous user does not have add item rightsp  pAfter a few tests and studying the interactions I noticed that the issue would be that WCF uses multiple messages and thus multiple HttpContext are being used. The cookies and login are not being retained between the requests.

Negative 368 pI need an advice from a SWIG guru, Ill try to explain this with my best even its a little complex I have a base lib that encapsulated all my base data members , for the example, well take a Job class. This library is used extensively by several .exe and its into a dedicated DLL. The entire DLL is wrapped with swig and exposed to python, so I can easily launch python code that access my Job class.p  pIn one particular executable, thats entirely multithreaded, the Job class is a base class of a more protected class called MultithreadJob. This class also derives from a GCClass, that implements a garbage collecting policy.p  pIm writing a new module that accepts and returns MultithreadJob as input and output parameters.p  pThe point here is that I needp  p1 To handle calls like GetJoblong id, MultiThreadJob job directly in Python using pointers to pointers as a return typep  p2 Handle the garbage collector, each type I return a MultiThreadJob , it needs to be Retain , and also Release when Python disposes it.p  p3 From a Python point of view, I would like to user to have access to Job in the same way as the base class, so what should be definitively passed back to Python should be a down casting of the pointer to a Jobp  p4 The Job class is exposed from the base.i module, but all this stuff should apply only to functions I define into the more generalized multithread.i module, thats compiled separatelyp  pIve read the refunref extensions of swig as well as using pointers to pointers, but Im facing a more complex case, and totally lost at the moment.p  pDo you have any advice p

Negative 368 pI am working on code to programmatically eject a USB device on user request using the Win32 API which I dont normally work with.  From searching the web up and down, the code below is what I have come up with.p  pAs you can see, my call to CreateFile used to pass GENERICREADGENERICWRITE for the dwIoControlCode parameter, but when I debugged, I got a handle with value INVALIDHANDLEVALUE.  In my call to FormatMessage, the GetLastError call returned a code that translated to Access is denied.  Looking around, I saw someone who said pass 0 instead of GENERICREADGENERICWRITE.  I tried that and I got a handle, no longer a bad handle value.  With the nonbad handle value, I continued working with the subsequent code.p  pThe next call was to DeviceIoControl GetHandleInformation and DeviceIoControl came in later for debugging purposes, passing the supposedly nonbad handle along with FSCTLLOCKVOLUME for the dwIoControlCode parameter, and the call returned false, with GetLastError returning a code translating to Incorrect function.  I inserted the calls to GetHandleInformation and DeviceIoControl..., IOCTLSTORAGECHECKVERIFY, ... just before this in order to check my handle.  GetHandleInformation returned true, so that sounded good.  However, DeviceIoControl..., IOCTLSTORAGECHECKVERIFY, ... returned false, with GetLastError returning a code translating to Access is denied.  I havent yet been able to get passed this point.p  pThis code, or variations on it, is suggested by many on the internet, but its not working for me.  Im hoping someone can point out where Im going wrong here.  Im compiling on Win7 64bit using the MSVC2010 compiler.p  pThanks for any help.p  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt  void ejectDrivechar driveletter      DWORD dwRet  0     DWORD retSize     LPTSTR pTempNULL     bool ok  false     char devicepath[7]     char format[]  .     wchart wtext[7]      strcpysdevicepath, format     devicepath[4]  driveletter     mbstowcswtext, devicepath,strlendevicepath1      HANDLE hVol  CreateFilewtext, 0 GENERICREAD  GENERICWRITE,                              FILESHAREWRITE  FILESHAREREAD, NULL,                              OPENEXISTING, 0, NULL     if hVol  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE              retSizeFormatMessageFORMATMESSAGEALLOCATEBUFFER                               FORMATMESSAGEFROMSYSTEM                               FORMATMESSAGEARGUMENTARRAY,                               NULL,                               GetLastError,                               LANGNEUTRAL,                               LPTSTRamppTemp,                               0,                               NULL          return           LPDWORD lpdwFlags     ok  GetHandleInformationhVol, lpdwFlags     retSizeFormatMessageFORMATMESSAGEALLOCATEBUFFER                           FORMATMESSAGEFROMSYSTEM                           FORMATMESSAGEARGUMENTARRAY,                           NULL,                           GetLastError,                           LANGNEUTRAL,                           LPTSTRamppTemp,                           0,                           NULL       ok  DeviceIoControlhVol, IOCTLSTORAGECHECKVERIFY, NULL,0,NULL, 0, lpdwFlags, 0     ifok              retSizeFormatMessageFORMATMESSAGEALLOCATEBUFFER                               FORMATMESSAGEFROMSYSTEM                               FORMATMESSAGEARGUMENTARRAY,                               NULL,                               GetLastError,                               LANGNEUTRAL,                               LPTSTRamppTemp,                               0,                               NULL          return           ok  DeviceIoControlhVol, FSCTLLOCKVOLUME, 0, 0, 0, 0, ampdwRet, 0     ifok              retSizeFormatMessageFORMATMESSAGEALLOCATEBUFFER                               FORMATMESSAGEFROMSYSTEM                               FORMATMESSAGEARGUMENTARRAY,                               NULL,                               GetLastError,                               LANGNEUTRAL,                               LPTSTRamppTemp,                               0,                               NULL          return           ifDeviceIoControlhVol, FSCTLDISMOUNTVOLUME, 0, 0, 0, 0, ampdwRet, 0              return           DeviceIoControlhVol, IOCTLSTORAGEEJECTMEDIA, 0, 0, 0, 0, ampdwRet, 0      CloseHandlehVol  codepre

The call to getProp is not virtual so it goes directly to the proxied class which has not been assigned to yet.p  pIs this correct Is there any way I can fix thisp  pIf there is a solution avoiding DynamicProxy altogether Id love to hear it, but please note that in the real scenario ClassB may be one of many classes so just deriving from it manually isnt a viable solution.p

I reset the state to N at the start of each update cycle updates throttled and at first, with 2 DataTriggers for each scenario , it looked like all is working fine. I was seeing both green amp red animations but then I noticed that there were updates happening with no updates. Once updates came through, it seemed only the DataTrigger that was declared first would actually work, on the rare occasion when there is no occurrences of first condition, the other trigger would fire. To test this theory was true I ran with each condition first and as expected in each case the first declared trigger would only fire 90 the time.p  pI have searched everywhere to try find reason for this anomaly but have had no luck, if anyone can shed some light on how to fix this issue or even perhaps implement the same functionality in a more reliable way, would greatly appreciate it.p  precode ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderLast Trade Width60 BindingBinding lasttrade IsReadOnlytruegt       ltDataGridTextColumn.CellStylegt                     ltStyle TargetTypeDataGridCellgt                          ltStyle.Triggersgt                             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding Pathlasttradestate ValueDgt                                 ltDataTrigger.EnterActionsgt                                     ltBeginStoryboardgt                                         ltStoryboardgt                                             ltColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetPropertyBackground.Color Duration000001 FromLightSalmon ToTransparentgtltColorAnimationgt                                         ltStoryboardgt                                     ltBeginStoryboardgt                                 ltDataTrigger.EnterActionsgt                             ltDataTriggergt                              ltDataTrigger BindingBinding Pathlasttradestate ValueUgt                                 ltDataTrigger.EnterActionsgt                                     ltBeginStoryboardgt                                         ltStoryboardgt                                             ltColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetPropertyBackground.Color Duration000001 FromLightGreen ToTransparentgtltColorAnimationgt                                         ltStoryboardgt                                     ltBeginStoryboardgt                                 ltDataTrigger.EnterActionsgt                             ltDataTriggergt                          ltStyle.Triggersgt                     ltStylegt                 ltDataGridTextColumn.CellStylegt             ltDataGridTextColumngt codepre

Then I commented out all sections that used anything in that unit and strongcompiledstrong, strongbulitstrong and strongranstrong the project. It went without any errors or warnings. I strongsaved all filesstrong and closed the Delphi IDE, started up a Notepad and removed the forms declaration from the unit, then deleted every associated file, except the .pas with this, it became like any other regular unit.p  pThen I searched every file in the projects folder with Total Commander to see if any of them contained the name of the removed unit. None did. I started Delphi and loaded the project. With this I felt satisfied and added the units name to the emusesem list and pressed emCompileem.p  pstrongIT STILL LOOKS FOR THE DAMNED DFMstrongp  pIf someone knows, please explain this to me.

Negative 368 pSo I am currently learning OpenGL ES 2.0 with iOS and working on a maze game. The maze is randomly generated so not a loaded model and my struggle is texturing the walls and floor of the maze. My approach is to just treat the maze as a series of cubes, and I have code that draws the individual faces of a cube separately so I can create a path by simply leaving some faces out.p  pUsing capture GPU frame, I have confirmed that the texture is indeed loading in correctly, the data in the frame buffers is correct and that Im not getting any errors.

Heres a portion of my Tomcat directoryp  precodeTOMCATHOME     lib          jtds1.3.1.jar          many other default jar files     webapps          TestSite                 index.jsp                 login.jsp                 WEBINF                        classes                              com                                    testsite                                         LoginServlet.class                                         ConnectionManager.class                                         UserDAO.class                                         UserBean.class                        lib                        web.xml codepre  pThe package for the class files are codecom.testsitecode, hence the subdirectories within the codeclassescode folder. Reading the Tomcat documentation, placing jar files in the root codelibcode folder will allow all web apps to access them. Ive also tried putting the jar files in the codewebappsTestSiteWEBINFlibcode directory, but get the same error.p  pIn my web application, Im registering the jTDS with the DriverManager in one of my classes, which is called from a servlet.p  precodepackage com.testsite import java.sql.  public class ConnectionManager      static Connection con     static String url      public static Connection getConnection throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException           url  jdbcjtdssqlserverlocalhost1433testdb          Class.forNamenet.sourcefourge.jtds.jdbc.Driver           con  DriverManager.getConnectionurl,username,password          return con        codepre  pWhen I start up the Tomcat server, Im able to successfully navigate to the starting page, but when I try to login which calls the codegetConnectioncode method, it gives the following error. Why can it not see it in the codelibcode folder How can I fix itp  precodejava.lang.ClassNotFoundException net.sourcefourge.jtds.jdbc.Driver         at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.loadClassWebappClas sLoaderBase.java1305         at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.loadClassWebappClas sLoaderBase.java1157         at java.lang.Class.forName0Native Method         at java.lang.Class.forNameClass.java264         at com.trainingsite.ConnectionManager.getConnectionConnectionManager.ja va22 codepre

Negative 368 pIs there something special about how an MFC project handles includesp  pHeres the scenario. I like to define my class member functions in the codehcode file, instead of splitting up a class between two files.p  pIn Visual Studio I can create an empty Win32 project and do something like thisp  pstrongmain.cppstrongp  precodeinclude doubleDef.h  int main      doubleDef t     t.func     return 0  codepre  pstrongdoubleDef.hstrongp  precodepragma once  class doubleDef  public    int func   int doubleDeffunc      return 4  codepre  pThis builds just fine.p  pIf I take codedoubleDef.hcode into an MFC dialog project, and add codeinclude doubleDef.hcode to the codehcode file of the main dialog, I get LNK2005, saying that codefunccode is already defined, making it seem as if the codepragma oncecode is being ignored.p  pIf I instead include codedoubleDef.hcode in the main dialogs codecppcode file, everything is fine. But in the empty Win32 I can include codedoubleDef.hcode multiple times by doing thisp  pstrongHeader.hstrongp  precodepragma once include doubleDef.h codepre  pstrongHeader1.hstrongp  precodepragma once include doubleDef.h codepre  pstrongmain.cppstrongp  precodeinclude Header.h include Header1.h  int main      doubleDef t     t.func     return 0  codepre  pThat is, it appears codepragma oncecode works as expected prevents multiple definitions of codedoubleDeffunccode.p  pIf I turn codedoubleDefcode into a template class, then the function definition emmustem be in the codehcode file. Likewise, I can make codefunccode codeinlinecode, either by adding the keyword or implicitly by defining it next to the declaration in the class as in codeint func return 4code, and then, again the definition emmustem be in the codehcode file.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryz8y1yy88.aspxf255ampMSPPError2147217396 relnofollowdocumentationa, the compiler treats codeinlinecode as more or less optional, so it seems like if I just want to keep everything in the codehcode file, I can just make everything codeinlinecode.p  pWhat givesp

Weve found that we   left out important information about how the secure functions behave   from the Format Specification Syntax page. The secure functions do   additional validation of the format string, and invoke the invalid   parameter handler if an unexpected character follows the initial    character. By default, this terminates the program with a Dr. Watson   report. In Debug mode, it causes an assert first. More information is   available in the Parameter Validation topic at   a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryksazx244.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryksazx244.aspxa . The Format   Specification Syntax page is being updated with this information.   Expect to see the updated page for Visual Studio 2013 in the next week   or so.p blockquote

However, it does this by enumerating through the active sessions, and as far as I can tell, there isnt any easy way to get the application name directly through any of the Core Audio Interfaces. p  pIve tried a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopdd368246vvs.85.aspx relnofollowIAudioSessionControlas GetDisplayName function, and it sort of works. Out of the five sessions being reported by the program, two of them return a value when the function is called. One is AudioSrv.Dll, which appears to be the Windows system sounds, and the other is my Line In input that I have set up to monitor through my output device. The other three sessions dont return anything when that function is called, so it cant be used to identify which is Teamspeak and which is Foobar2000.p  pAnyone have any ideas on how to get the application name so I can identify which session index corresponds to which application at runtimep

The sequence, for example, is 4F B0 33 47 A3 BC. p  pSo its hex numbers and each 6 bytes all together must be unique and would start from 00 00 00 00 00 00 to FF FF FF FF FF FF.p  pSo the problem is that I cant figure out how I could set the counter to go like from 0 to F and do all the possible combinations.p  pAll I know is that it cant be done randomly because it can generate duplicates during the process and as I said it must be unique 6bytes sequence.p  pSo any one have any idea on how I could do thatp

Negative 368 pI am a beginner and I am using SQL Server for this particular query.  I have to combine data of two rows into one row. The difference is the people who conducted the inspection. I have no problem getting all data. But I cannot put two rows of data into single row. codeConductor 1code and codeConductor 2code are not supposed to be the same person.  Every inspection can be reviewed more than 2 person. So, right now I am trying to group each row by codeItemscode. Each item can be reviewed more than 2 person.

Negative 368 pI would like to integrate a system of differential equations for several parameter combinations using Pythons multiprocessing module.

Negative 368 pWe have a PhoneGap based app that has been built on jQuery Mobile.

Negative 368 h2Backgroundh2  pOne of our clients has a system where they have recordings of phone conversations between their agents and their customers, who they create various contracts with. The recordings are stored on a server with their locations saved in the Recordings table in the database. The agents can then attach a recording to a contract, which creates an entry in the ContractRecordings table. I have a need to create a report that shows which recordings are not attached to a contract but the way the tables are designed is making this more difficult than expected.p  precodeRecording  recordingId  INT PK, IDENTITY agentId  INT, FK filename  NVARCHAR255   ContractRecording  recordingId  INT PK, IDENTITY contractNumber  INT created  DATETIME username  NVARCHAR20 note  NVARCHARMAX fileLocation  NVARCHARmax codepre  pThis would be easy if ContractRecording.recordingId was a foreign key reference to Recording.recordingId but it isnt. Its its own identity key. The only link between the tables is the file location but Recording.filename only stores the filename whereas ContractRecording.fileLocation stores the full path. Yeah, I know but I didnt design these tables. Luckily, there is a pattern and the full path is derived from the Agents name and the date of the recording, both of which we can know from data in the Recording table. But of course, theres another problem the format for the file path changed a year or so ago and some recordings are stored under the old format and some under the new format. p  pOld Format CJohnRecordings201506150811.wavp  pNew Format CRecordingsJohn Smith201506150811.wavp  h2The Problemh2  pIn order to link the two tables, I have to join them on the full path of the recordings, which must be constructed manually on the Recording table and can be in one of two formats. I originally tried using an OR in the JOIN clause but that takes around 8 minutes to return back around 15k rows, which is not acceptable. I then tried using two LEFT OUTER JOINs  one for each condition  but that took ten minutes to pull what seemed to be the same data. I imagine thats because Im joining on a custom field, which isnt indexed. Splitting it into two SELECTs and using a UNION resulted in duplicate rows each query would return one row for every recording. Do I have any other options to get this query down to under a few seconds Heres my original query using the OR clause.p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT  FROM     SELECT          cr.recordingid AS attachedrecordingid         ,rec.recordingid AS rawrecordingid         ,cr.contractnumber         ,cr.created         ,rec.name         ,cr.note         ,cr.filelocation         ,rec.filename         ,rec.recordtime     FROM ContractRecording cr     RIGHT OUTER JOIN     SELECT          recordingid         ,a.name         ,filename         ,retain         ,r.recordtime         ,CRecordings  a.name    CONVERTNVARCHAR4, DATEPARTyyyy, recordtime    CONVERTNVARCHAR2, DATEPARTm, recordtime    filename AS fullpathnew         ,C  SUBSTRINGa.name, 0, CHARINDEX , a.name, 0  Recordings  CONVERTNVARCHAR4, DATEPARTyyyy, recordtime    CONVERTNVARCHAR2, DATEPARTm, recordtime    filename AS fullpathold     FROM Recording r     JOIN Agents a         ON r.agentid  a.agentid rec     ON cr.filelocation  rec.fullpathold OR cr.filelocation  rec.fullpathnew main ORDER BY main.name, main.recordtime codepre  pThe report needs to show one row for all records in the Recording table unless a single recording is attached to multiple contracts, in which case it should show one row per pairing, with data from ContractRecording displayed if there are any rows that match on either of the filelocation formats. p  pIf absolutely necessary, Im not opposed to just pulling all the data from both tables and linking them through code but that would be a last resort. p  h2UPDATEh2  pAs requested, heres the UNION version of the query for analysis. As mentioned, it returns two rows for every pairing  one with data and one without. This is because at least one of the two JOINs is always going to have no matches but I only want to ignore those when the other JOIN does have a match. If neither JOIN matches, I also only want to display it once. Im less confident I can achieve my desired result with a UNION than I am with other possibilities so I havent pursued this approach.p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT  FROM     SELECT          cr.recordingid AS attachedrecordingid         ,rec.recordingid AS rawrecordingid         ,cr.contractnumber         ,cr.created         ,rec.name         ,cr.note         ,cr.filelocation         ,rec.filename         ,rec.recordtime     FROM ContractRecording cr     RIGHT OUTER JOIN     SELECT          recordingid         ,a.name         ,filename         ,retain         ,r.recordtime         ,C  SUBSTRINGa.name, 0, CHARINDEX , a.name, 0  Recordings  CONVERTNVARCHAR4, DATEPARTyyyy, recordtime    CONVERTNVARCHAR2, DATEPARTm, recordtime    filename AS fullpathold     FROM Recording r     JOIN Agents a         ON r.agentid  a.agentid rec     ON cr.filelocation  rec.fullpathold     UNION     SELECT          cr.recordingid AS attachedrecordingid         ,rec.recordingid AS rawrecordingid         ,cr.contractnumber         ,cr.created         ,rec.name         ,cr.note         ,cr.filelocation         ,rec.filename         ,rec.recordtime     FROM ContractRecording cr     RIGHT OUTER JOIN     SELECT          recordingid         ,a.name         ,filename         ,retain         ,r.recordtime         ,CRecordings  a.name    CONVERTNVARCHAR4, DATEPARTyyyy, recordtime    CONVERTNVARCHAR2, DATEPARTm, recordtime    filename AS fullpathnew     FROM Recording r     JOIN Agents a         ON r.agentid  a.agentid rec     ON cr.filelocation  rec.fullpathnew main ORDER BY main.name, main.recordtime codepre
Negative 368 pI have used Ruby, Sinatra framework to implement a webservice API. Used MYSQL for db connection and query. My ruby code interacts with active record model and fetch records from db.p  pMy database is a dynamic db which grows very fast and updates records very frequently, where I cant use any cache.p  pCurrently, in my database, single table contains more than 500k records. which takes too much time to execute a select query and fetch records from tablecontaining 500k records which might grow even bigger.p  pThis results and impacts badly on my API get request. Taking around half an hour to process the API which is a big impact on API performance.p  pCan anyone please suggest me what tools or any efficient ways to make my API faster.p

Negative 368 pIve got a graph of small multiples with line charts. All is spiffy, except I cannot figure out how to get the tooltip to grab the data I need it to.p  pThe sample and the code is at a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgemagee8b2f557396d6f16ba65f relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgemagee8b2f557396d6f16ba65fa. The tooltip code starts at line 198, with the toolTip variable declared just above that. The tooltip itself is working awesomely, but I cannot figure out how to get the tooltip to show the date and count variables.  I did figure out how to get the subject in tool tip, but that is redundant, as you will see.p  pSpecifically, my problem stems from not knowing how to skip a level as I dig deeper into the object  key is the first level, then values, then an unnamed construct, THEN the data I need date and count.p  pAny guidance on how to get from key to the date and count data would be most appreciated.  I do understand that it may be more of a basic JS problem than a D3.js problem, but Im a bit shaky with bothp  pAddendum and, Im afraid, a second question  Im also wondering now if part of the problem is that Im accessing the entire linepath  as opposed to individual points. Should I perhaps overlay some appropriately sized, invisible circlespoints on the lines and have the tooltip try to take readings from those...p

My question is what is the easiest way of changing the code so click and click2 can be found in the code Should I claim them as global variables at the beginning if so, how or something elsep
