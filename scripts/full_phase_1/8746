Positive 8746 pIm very new to prolog. I have a size of list predicate. Im trying to make another predicate that takes two arguments an int, and a list and it calls the size of list predicate on the passed in list and returns true if the list size matches the int passed in.p  pThis is what I have so far.p  precodesize[],0. size[HT],N  sizeT,N1, N is N11.  isEqual[X,Y]  Xsize[Y,N]. X is an int representing expected length of list, Y is the list codepre  pAdvice is welcomed. p
Positive 8746 pI am fresh in Prolog.

Positive 8746 pI need to apply my predicate to a list of lists. I heard maplist3 might be able to do this but my lists within the list may vary in length and maplist likes all the same length lists. p  pHere is the predicate I need to apply to all lists in the list. It checks if any elements in another list in the same position are the same and if they are it returns false. Ex compatible[1,2,3,4,5],[1,6,7,3,2] would return false since the 1 matches in the 1st position. This predicate works for varying lengths of lists.p  precodecompatible[],. compatible,[]. compatible[HATA],[HBTB]      HA  HB,     compatibleTA,TB. codepre  pA sample lists of list might look like thisp  precode[[3,4,6,6,7],[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]],[[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]].  Let X and Y be the lists passed in. where X[[3,4,6,6,7],[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]] and Y[[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]] codepre  pI need to apply the predicate to the Y list only. How would I call compatible on the list of lists to do that keeping in mind varying length.p

Positive 8746 pIm quite new to Prolog, and this way of thinking is kind of messing with my mind. Im currently using SWIProlog to run and debug my code. I have implemented a tail recursive algorithm to solve the Nth fibonnacinumber. I have tried debugging step by step, and I cannot explain why my implementation is skipping the base case. Where am I thinking wrongp  precodefib0, A,, A. Base case, when we reach N  0, return. Tail recursion. Use N as counter, iterate until base value N0 is  reached. fibN, A, B, F     Nnew is N  1,    Sum is A  B,    fibNnew, B, Sum, F.  fibN, F     fibN, 0, 1, F. set start values for when fibN,F. is called codepre  pMy implementation is working great and fast if I want to calculate the nth fib number. For example, if I run code fib5,F.code, I get F  5 back. Great. If I want to check code fib5,5.code I get codeTruecode back, which is correct. Great.p  pBut, if I input a false statement, for example code fib5,4.code then the program is looping forever. What happens is that N passes 0, ignores the base case, and continues on to be decremented. Why is the base case skipped In my eyes, codefib0,A,,A.code is satisfied. Where am I wrongp

Positive 8746 pSo i am trying to write a predicate in prolog that can take a list L1 and a list L2 and return a list of all the elements in L1 that are not in L2. This is what i have so farp  precode Append an element to a list. myappendelemX,L,[XL].   True if input list contains X. mycontains[H  T], X      H  X     mycontainsT,X.   Does the work for notin. nocontains[],,A,A. nocontains[HT],L,A,R     mycontainsL,H,     nocontainsT,L,A,R     myappendelemH,A,AR,     nocontainsT,L,AR,R.   Returns all elements in L1 not in L2. notinL1,L2,R     nocontainsL1,L2,[],X. codepre  pThis works, however it gives more than one answer, for example p  precodenotin[5,1],[4,3,2,1],X. X  [5] X  [5,1]. codepre  pThis is a problem as i am using this predicate to sort out paths in a graphL1 being the list of nodes i might go to, and L2 being the nodes i have already been to to ensure that i wont visit the same node more than once and get stuck in a loop. But this implementation gets me stuck in a loop, because it backtracks after it tries with the first X and it fails, to the unaltered X, getting into an infinite loop between the same two nodes that can reach each other. I know this is easy to fix by adding cuts to nocontains like sop  precode Does the work for notin. nocontains[],,A,A. nocontains[HT],L,A,R     mycontainsL,H,,     nocontainsT,L,A,R     myappendelemH,A,AR,,     nocontainsT,L,AR,R. codepre  pBut is there a way to achieve the same without cuts So when I use notin I get only one possible answer Its for school, and part of the assignment is to not use any builtin predicates or control operatorsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pJust to be more specific on the limitations of the assignment It should consist of pure facts and rules, we are not allowed to use any builtin predicates or control structuresincluding but not limited to arithmetic, cuts or negationasfailure. Semicolon is okay. Any utility predicates needed we need to define ourselves.p  pThanks for all the answers but I am starting to think that it might be more a problem with the method I use for finding a path between two nodes in a graph, as from the answers it doesnt look like there is an easy way around this.p

Negative 8746 pUp until today, I had always thought that decent compilers automatically convert struct passbyvalue to passbyreference if the struct is large enough that the latter would be faster.  To the best of my knowledge, this seems like a nobrainer optimization.  However, to satisfy my curiosity as to whether this actually happens, I created a simple test case in both C and a hrefhttpwww.digitalmars.comd1.0Da and looked at the output of both GCC and Digital Mars D.  Both insisted on passing 32byte structs by value when all the function in question did was add up the members and return the values, with no modification of the struct passed in.  The C version is below.p  precodeinclude iostream.h  struct S      int i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p   int fooS s      return s.i  s.j  s.k  s.l  s.m  s.n  s.o  s.p   int main      S s     int bar  foos     cout ltlt bar  codepre  pMy question is, why the heck wouldnt something like this be optimized by the compiler to passbyreference instead of actually pushing all those codeintcodes onto the stackp  pNote  Compiler switches used  GCC O2 O3 inlined foo., DMD O inline release.p  pEdit  Obviously, in the general case the semantics of passbyvalue vs. passbyreference wont be the same, such as if copy constructors are involved or the original struct is modified in the callee.  However, in a lot of realworld scenarios, the semantics will be identical in terms of observable behavior.  These are the cases Im asking about.p

Negative 8746 pI have a thirdparty library that is sometimes throwing an exception.  So I decided to wrap my code in a trycatch... so that I could log information about the exception occurring no specific details, just that it happened.  p  pBut for some reason, the code still crashes.  On client computers, it crashes hard and the code to log the exception in the catch... never gets executed.  If I run this on my debug  development machine I get the popup asking me if I want to debug.  When I do this, it reports 0xC0000005 Access violation reading location XXX.p  pThe odd thing is that with an older version of the thirdparty library, the exact same code DOES catch the exception, and the code to log the exception DOES execute.  I verified this within VS watching the same conditions occur.p  pHeres the pseudocode that is executingp  precodepObject  pSystemgtGetpObject pSystemgtDoSomethingThatMightDestroypObject try     Call to third party function that is throwing exception  pObjectgtSetValue0  catch ...

Negative 8746 pObviously I am wrong in saying that DDD is similar to EAVCR in usefulness, but the only difference I see so far is physical tables build for each entity with lots of joins rather than three tables and lots of joins.p  pThis must be due to my lack of DDD understanding.  strongHow do you physically store these objects to the database without significant joins and complication when importing datastrong  I know you can simply create objects that feed in to your repository, but its difficult to train tools like Microsoft Sql Server Integration Server to use your custom C objects and framework.  Maybe that should be my question, how do you use your DDD ASP.NET C framework with Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services and Report Services LOL.p  pIn an EAVCR database, we can setup a single Person table with different classes depending on the type of person Vendor, Customer, Buyer, Representative, Company, Janitor, etc.  Three tables, a few joins, attributes are always string with validation before we insert, just like ModelValidation in MVC where the object accepts any value but wont persist until its valid.p  pIn a standard relational model, we used to create a table for each type of entity, mixing in redundant data types like City.p  pUsing Domain Driven Design, we use objects to represent each type of entity, nested objects for each type of ValueObject, and more nested objects still as necessary.  In my understanding, this results in a table for each kind of entity and a table for each kind of information set value object.  With all these tables, I see a lot of joins.  We also end up creating a physical table for each new contact type.  Obviously there is a better way, so I must be incorrect in how I persist objects to a database.p  pMy Vendor looks like thisp  precodepublic class Vendor      public int vendorID get set     public Address vAddress get set     public Representative vRep getset     public Buyer vBuyer get set  codepre  pMy Buyerp  precodepublic class Buyer     public int buyerID get set    public Address bAddress get set    public Email bEmail get set    public Phone bPhone get set    public Phone bFax get set  codepre  pDo we really reference things like Vendor.vBuyer.bPhone.pAreaCode  I would think we would reference and store Vendor.BuyerPhoneNumber, and build the objects almost like aliases to these parts Vendor.Address1, Vendor.Address2, Vendor.BuyerPhoneNumber ... etc.p

Negative 8746 pIm trying to plan a architecture for a robotcontroller application, which will be written in WPF. Since that MVVM is the emde factoem pattern for WPF, and in general is much more sexy I decided to use it as a base layout.p  pThe application will have some controllers that access hardware, beyond the domainmodel that represents the database and utility classes. And for the database access I intend to use a Repository coining Ayendes IRepository as the general idea, and then Linq2sql or EF4 for the actual access. p  pThe application will also have its own scripting engine, for custom scripts.p  pBut what Im unsure of, is if I should consider access to the hardware controllers and the scripting engine, to be part or below the domain model, or something thats directly accessed from the controller level.p  pI attempted to draw up what I think is the right way to do it. But Im not at all sure its the right way to go, so I would love some input and advice on this, and how I possible can do it better.p  pimg srchttpdl.dropbox.comu1744224UploadDrawing7.png p

Negative 8746 pI have a ACLauth driven app. Everything works fine but I discovered that user is logged out after a random period of time. After doing some research I discovered that the cookie set once doesnt change its expiration date on page refresh.

Does CakePHP deal with cookie files automatically Or do I have to take care about it myself  All I did is set up a cookie name in configcore.php and setup auth. I dont have any cookie handling function, but the cookie is created itself  correctly, just isnt updatedp
Negative 8746 pI have a single threaded message listener that listens for the incoming messages.The received messages are persisted in a database as they are recieved.p  pThere is a message A and associated message B follows it with a reference it.In Some Odd occurences, B arrives before A.  Now in this case, There has to be 3retries after some x equal intervals to see if A has arrived and then persists the association.p  pAs the message listener is single threaded if we put the thread to sleep the whole system would be affected. So there has to be a separate thread retrying.p  pCan we use Quartz Job Scheduler for this purpose to avoid handling multiThreading issues and to have a PERSISTENT STORE of the in any of the following 2 ways,p  ol liSchedule a Job in Quartz for 3 times  and keep track of a flag in the JobDataMap to check if previous retries succeeds then return without doing anythingli ol  pORp  p2.Schedule a Job to retry once and then if the retry fails schedule the same job after a few seconds. p  pCan quartz be used only for repetitive jobs and not have some state information span across job or Is there any other better way to do this.p

Negative 8746 pI need a HashMap that is accessible from multiple threads.p  pThere are two simple options, using a normal HashMap and synchronizing on it or using a ConcurrentHashMap.p  pSince ConcurrentHashMap does not block on read operations it seems much better suited for my needs almost exclusively reads, almost never updates.

Negative 8746 pIve had an idea for a nonlinear regression algorithm that I havent seen beforep  pWe fit a simple parametric function, such as a radial basis function, to the data using gradient descent. We find the residual from this and then fit a function to this, repeating this process to reduce the error and build up a collection of superimposed functions. Im assuming that the search can be persuaded to find the functions that fit the most points firstp  pAs presented this algorithm would overfit. I think there are a few ways to overcome that but probably the most obvious is to limit the number of functions that are fitted. p  pI think it should be faster than a neural or rbf network because it doesnt have to tune so many parameters at once. There is no network architecture to choose. It should be more accurate than a decision tree algorithm such as M5 because it could follow a continuous curve more closely and doesnt have to choose attributes on which to split.p  pHas it been tried before If so, why wasnt it successfulp

Negative 8746 pMy question might be silly, but Im pretty sure I miss a very important part of the issue. I have to do some object to object mapping between domain classes used in C project and classes which are sent to flash clients.p  pMy first choice was Automapper. But Ive had some issues with it nested properties, not paramterless constructor defined. It turns out that it is not so easy to map a really complex type with automapper.p  pThen my question is Why not implement methods like p  precode  ClassA GetClassAByClassBClassB pObj             ClassA objA  new ClassA        objA.Prop1  pObj.Prop1        objA.NestedType.Prop2  pObj.Prop2        ....Some more.....        return objA         codepre  pIt has exactly the same level of flexibility like mapping done using Automapper. You still have to provide which property from source object are copied into what properties in destinations object. You just do this using  and not lambda expression.p  pBut if you change something in your domain classes you have to change this mapping part anyway. So what is the main thing which should convince me to using Automapper as I said at the beginning Im pretty sure Im missing something important.p

Anyway, I have a rapidly developing framework and quite a few times foldersfiles get deletedrenamed. Deletionrenaming itself is unintuitive in SVN through tortoise anyway but Ill let that slide. p  pProblem occurs when I am merging. If I have deletedrenamed a file or directory I get tree conflicts. Sometimes the merge fails to add a file to the trunk which was added to a branch and keeps on telling me that merge is successful and no files are added. I have now resorted to manually merging these problem branches. p  pManual merge is dead easy except when there is a rename or a deletion. I will take rename as deletion as well, because in the end that is what it really is. Is there a way to automatically delete the folders and files that are left in the trunk when I do a manual merge p  pThis is how I am doing a manual mergep  ol liExport all the changed files from the branchli liSwitch to trunk, overwrite all the existing files while adding new foldersfiles as wellli liCommitli ol  pTo reiterate, the hard way to delete the renameddeleted filesfolders is to do a comparison.

Negative 8746 pI cant find the answer on SO but its very likely that the argument has been already discussed. p  pIm trying to write a quite small size program using the Python language. Its my first real experience with a dynamic language and I would prefer to do everything in the right way. One of the practice that I would try to apply since the beginning is unittesting.p  pHow can I quickly test that the parameters of a method are of the right type Should I do itp  pWith right type I mean for instance to check that a method that works with float numbers is not called with a String. In this case consider the possibility that the method should obviously accept even integers and not only float.p

Negative 8746 pUgh.  Word is notorious for its bloated, convoluted, nonstandardscompliant, nonsemantic HTML.  Unfortunately, I have a professor who is requiring us to generate an outline to very exacting standards.  Id rather not handwrite it, so I decided to make something that would be useful for my classmates as well.  I created the outline using a simple numbered list in NeoOffice on my Mac, exported it as HTML, and wrote quite a bit of CSS to style it.  Then, I got someone to create an ordered list in Word for Windows, export it as html, and send it to me to check compatibility.  After scrolling miles down the page, trying to repress a shudder, I saw a problem.  Word did not use codeltolgtcode and codeltligtcode.  It used mountains of nested codeltspangtcodes with classes out the wazoo.  I hate to see all my work go to waste, but this content is impossible to work withId have to style on a documenttodocument basis, rather than with a universal stylesheet.p  pIdeally, Word would generate HTML using standard tags so that I could style it just like any other list, but this doesnt seem to be the case.  How can I make it generate lists that actually use codeltulgtcode and codeltligtcode rather than codeltspangtcode, or at least modify something in my code to somehow work with the way weird way it does create listsp

I created a group developer. I added myself and him to a group, changed the group of the directory recursively, and then recursively gave the directory codegrwxcode permissions.p  pAt this point codeid usercode returns the name of the group as the primary group, and codellcode prints out the permissions as sop  precodedrwsrwxrx 15 john developer codepre  pThe owner being me, the group being developer, and group permissions being rwx. However, the other user still only has read and execute permissions, leading me to think hes being treated as other.p  pAny ideas of what I could be doing wrong here It seems pretty cut and dry and I cant find my error, any help would be greatly appreciated.p

When I run the code it pops up the force close menu and the debugger gives NullPointerException on my code for checking if savedInstanceState is empty. p  pHere is part of the main code where the problem occurs.p  precodepackage nicholsoft.LevelCounter  import android.app.Activity import android.app.AlertDialog import android.content.DialogInterface import android.os.Bundle import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.View.OnClickListener import android.widget.Button import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.ImageView import android.widget.TextView  public class LevelCounter extends Activity implements OnClickListener      public Player [] Players     TextView p1text     TextView p2text     TextView p3text     TextView p4text     TextView p5text     TextView p6text     TextView p1Level     ImageView p1Epic     TextView p2Level     ImageView p2Epic     TextView p3Level     ImageView p3Epic     TextView p4Level     ImageView p4Epic     TextView p5Level     ImageView p5Epic     TextView p6Level     ImageView p6Epic     TextView tTitle      private static final int MENUEPICON  1     private static final int MENUEPICOFF  2     private static final int MENURESETLEVELS  3     private static final int MENURESETNAMES  4     private static final int MENURESETALL  5     private static final int MENUQUIT  6      boolean Epic  false     String Title     int MaxLevel  10     int ilevel  1     String slevel  1      void ResetLevels         forint x0xlt6x             Players[x].setLevel1                  p1Level.setTextString.valueOfPlayers[0].getPlayerLevel         p2Level.setTextString.valueOfPlayers[1].getPlayerLevel         p3Level.setTextString.valueOfPlayers[2].getPlayerLevel         p4Level.setTextString.valueOfPlayers[3].getPlayerLevel         p5Level.setTextString.valueOfPlayers[4].getPlayerLevel         p6Level.setTextString.valueOfPlayers[5].getPlayerLevel         p1Epic.setImageResourceR.drawable.black         p2Epic.setImageResourceR.drawable.black         p3Epic.setImageResourceR.drawable.black         p4Epic.setImageResourceR.drawable.black         p5Epic.setImageResourceR.drawable.black         p6Epic.setImageResourceR.drawable.black          void SetNames         p1text.setTextPlayers[0].getName         p2text.setTextPlayers[1].getName         p3text.setTextPlayers[2].getName         p4text.setTextPlayers[3].getName         p5text.setTextPlayers[4].getName         p6text.setTextPlayers[5].getName          void ResetNames         forint x0xlt6x             Players[x].setNamePlayer .concatString.valueOfx1                  p1text.setTextPlayers[0].getName         p2text.setTextPlayers[1].getName         p3text.setTextPlayers[2].getName         p4text.setTextPlayers[3].getName         p5text.setTextPlayers[4].getName         p6text.setTextPlayers[5].getName          void ResetAll         ResetNames         ResetLevels          void MinusLevelPlayer p         if p.getPlayerLevelgt1         p.setLevelp.getPlayerLevel1                    void PlusLevelPlayer p         ifp.getPlayerLevelltMaxLevel             p.setLevelp.getPlayerLevel1                    void AskNamefinal Player p         final AlertDialog.Builder alert  new AlertDialog.Builderthis         final EditText input  new EditTextthis         alert.setViewinput         alert.setPositiveButtonOk, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener              public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int whichButton                  String value  input.getText.toString.trim                 p.setNamevalue                 SetNames                                alert.setNegativeButtonCancel, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                      public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int whichButton                          dialog.cancel                                               alert.show            Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 8746 pI have some Java code which executes a certain command on a Windows machine.

Now, things that I know arep  ol liI should really be using the overloaded Runtime.execString[] methodli liThe command uses a mix of forward and back slashesli ol  pThese are valid comments which Ill probably end up fixing the problem with, but what Im trying to work out is why the exact same code fails on emonlyem 3 out of 4 machines.p  pAnd yes, all the paths on mentioned in the command exist on the box.p  pAnd it gets more strange.  If I execute the following very similar command it works fine on all four boxes.p  precodecmd c APPHOME....somemorepathexecutable arg1value1 arg2value2 errorlognameDpathtoprogramlogserrors.log arg3 some more parameters codepre  pIn the above working version, the only difference is the codeAPPHOMEcode reference has been replaced with the absolute path for the codeerrorlognamecode argument.  But the variable has been left to point at location of the executable.p  pNow the fact that the identical code runs fine on one box leads me suspect that the problem is not the Java code.  Similarly, the mix of slash directions I dont see being a problem, because this concoction works on one machine.p  pIn my view, it should be failing on every machine.  Not just one of them.p  pObviously, if everything really was identical it would break or work on every machine.

Negative 8746 pIm working on a game in Java and have the following challenge.p  pI have 2 codeJPanelscode and need to visually drag shapes from one codeJPanelcode to another. Ive got this working using the codeGlassPanecode from the codeJFramecode. When I press the mouse to drag a shape, the codeGlassPanecode activates and transfers the shape to the glassPane. Because of this you need to transfer the codemousePressedcode state from the codeJPanels mouseAdaptercode to the codeglassPanes mouseAdaptercode. I solved this by using the Robot Class which simulates another codemousePressedcode event after the glassPane has been acivated.p  pNow here comes the problem, this workaround only works on windows and not on mac osx, on osx the mouse keeps talking to the codeJPanels mouseAdaptercode as long as the mousebutton is pressed. So does anyone know how to transfer the codemousePressedcode state from one codemouseAdaptercode to another while pressing the mousebutton, in a proper way Releasing the button and pressing it again is not an option as this would defeat the purpose of dragging.p

Negative 8746 pThe basic parts of this full motion video game isp  ul liThe user is shown a video clip which either plays to the end or can be skipped. A clip could be something like a character talking or of a location. Some of the clips might loop until the user clicks something e.g. the clip might show birds flying in the park.li liThe user is presented with several choices that are overlaid over the video clip at some point where the choices are things like 1. go to the park or 2. ask the man about the park.li liEach choice is linked with another video clip and another set of choices e.g. if the user picks option 2, they are shown a video of the man responding and can then follow up with more questions.li liId like the above to look seamless and presentable. For example, video clips and text options should fade in and out and Id like the  page to be fullscreen.li ul  pWould it be possible to do the above in HTML5 while supporting most desktop and mobile browsers Would some other language be more appropriate Id rather not use Flash, primarily because then I cannot easily support iOS.p  pFrom doing some research, the above seems easily possible in all modern browsers on desktop machines with the caveat that there doesnt appear to be any reliable way to make an HTML5 page go full screen, unlike Flash. The iOS situation looks grim as far as I know video clips will only play once the user has clicked on the clip and Im not sure if I can overlay buttons on these. Ive also read that the video tag can be buggy on Android.p  pCan anyone comment on what approach I can use for addressing these issuesp  pEdit More infop  ul liI have no constraints about it being server or client hosted.li liI know I cant realistically get this to work on every browser out there so Im really asking without having to write several ports of the game, what approach can I use to target a sizeable  audienceli ul

Negative 8746 pMy target is building a highly concurrent backend for my widgets.

Negative 8746 pI ran into this problem when I tried to write out an new algorithm to reorder elements in stdvector. The basic idea is that I have stdlist of pointters pointing into stdvector in such way that codelist.begin  vector[0]code, codelist.begin  vector[1]code and so on. However, any modifications on lists element positions breaks the mapping. Including appended pointers When the mapping is broken the lists elements can be in random order but they point still into correct elements on vector. The task would be to reorder the elements in vector to correct the mapping.p  pSimplest method to do it How I have done it nowp  ul licreate new empty stdvector and resize it to equal size of the old vector.li liiterate through the list and read elements from the old vector and write them into new vector. Set the pointer to point into new vectors element.li liswap vectors and release the old vector.li ul  pSadly the method is only useful when I need more capacity on the vector. Its inefficient when the current vector holding the elements has enough capacity to store all incoming elements. Appended pointers on the list will point into diffrent vectors storgate. The simple method works for this because it only reads from the pointers.p  pSo I would want to reorder the vector in place using constant amount of memory. Any pointer that was not pointing into current vectors storgate are moved to point into current vectors storgate. Elements are simple structures. PODs Ill try post an example code when I have time..p  pWhat should I do to achieve this I have the basic idea done, but Im not sure if it is even possible to do the reordering with constant amount of memory.p  hr  pPS Im sorry for the possibly bad grammar and typos in the post.

Negative 8746 pHow do I debug my C app when it really needs to be running from a specific folder and not from bindebug One of the first things my program does for example is determine what set of tools will be presented based on the executable file it finds. But since its running from the debug folder it cant find them. I can add the file there but that seems silly. There has to be a better way. Plus, theres really a bunch of other thighs it does that really requires it to be running from the proper folder eg.

Maybe a Maven import is not as straightforward as it seems, or it is not worth the effort even in the given case there is no simple 11 relation between Maven module and component for issue tracking, so it would only be useful for an initial configuration. p

The part of the image inside the rectangle should be visible, so all facecolor  should be none.

If PHP ended, wouldnt the socket connection be lost Or if the php reruns it will look back the user by ip I dont see that likelyp  pThen I found this library a hrefhttpcode.google.compphpwebsocket relnofollowhttpcode.google.compphpwebsocketa but it seems to be a little old it mentions only Chrome nightly is compatible with WebSocketsp  pIn one point says From the command line, run the server.php program to listen for socket connections. which means I need SSH, something many shared hosting plans dont have.p  pAnd my other doubt is this other line in the source of that libraryp  precode settimelimit0 codepre  pdoes that mean that the php file will run continuously Is that allow in shared hosting From what I know all hostings kill php after a timeout of 1 o2 minutes.p  pI have a mysql table with online users and I want to use PHP to broadcast via websocket the amount of logged in users to those online users. Can someone please help me or point me somewhere with better information how this could be achievedp  pThanksp

Negative 8746 pI am tying to write an application in .Net for a handheld RFID reader on which Windows CE is running.

Negative 8746 pHaving a wierd problem in JIRA at the moment. When Im on the Edit Issue page, If I have this line of code in my velocity template file edit.vmp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript         srcreq.contextPathdownloadresourcescom.company.jira.plugins.customerjqueryautocompletejquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pthen the down arrows next to the links at the top of the page for Dashboards,Projects,Issues etc... no longer work. However if i remove that line from my velocity template then the arrows start working again.p  pIt is important to note that when i remove this line from my velocity template my jQuery autocomplete input box stops working which is to be expected as I am removing the jquery.js from being included. Also when i include the above line the jQuery autocomplete box works flawlessly, its just that the arrows dont work as stated above. Obviously its crucial that the edit page has this jquery.js script included in a way that the arrows work as well.p  pAny suggestionshelp as to how i can include the jQuery library are much appreciated.

Negative 8746 pI have studied LDA and Topic model for several weeks.But due to my poor mathematics ability, i can not fully understand its inner algorithms.I have used the GibbsLDA implementation, input a lot of documents, and set topic number as 100, i got a file named final.theta which stores the topic proportion of each topic in each document.This result is good, i can use the topic proportion to do many other things. But when i tried Bleis C language implementation on LDA, i only got a file named final.gamma, but i dont know how to transform this file into topic proportion style. Can anyone help me. And i have learned that LDA model has many improved versionsuch as CTM,HLDA, if i can find a topic model similar to LDA, i mean when i input a lot of documents, it can directly output the topic proportion in the documents. Thank you very muchp

Negative 8746 pId like to start running my existing Selenium tests in parallel, but Im having trouble deciding on the best approach due to the way my current tests are written.p  pThe first step in of most of my tests is to get the DB into a clean state and then populate it with the data needed for the rest of the test.  While this is great to isolate tests from each other, if I start running these same Selenium tests in parallel on the same SUT, theyll end up erasing other tests data.p  pAfter much digging, I havent been able to find any guidance or bestpractices on how to deal with this situation.  Ive thought of a few ideas, but none have struck me as particularly awesomep  ol lipRewrite the tests to not overwrite other tests data, i.e. only add test data, never erase  I could see this potentially leading to unexpected failures due to the variability of the database when each test is run.  Anything from a different ordering of tests to an illplaced failure could throw off the other tests.  This just feels wrong.pli lipDont prepopulate the database  Instead, create all needed data via Selenium itself.  This would most replicate realworld usage, but would also take significantly longer than loading data directly into the database.  This would probably negate any benefits from parallelization depending on how much test data each test case needs.pli lipHave each Selenium node test a different copy of the SUT  This way, each test would be free to do as it pleases with the database, since we are assume that no other test is touching it at the same time.  The downside is that Id need to have multiple databases setup and, at the start of each test case, figure out how to coordinate which database to initialize and how to signal to the node and SUT that this particular test case should be using this particular database.  Not awful, but not what I would love to do if theres a better way.pli lipHave each Selenium node test a different copy of the SUT, but break up the tests into distinct suites, one suite per node, before runtime   Also viable, but not as flexible since over time youd want to keep going back and even the length of each suite as much as possible.pli ol  pAll in all, none of these seem like clear winners.  Option 3 seems the most reasonable, but I also have doubts about whether that is even a feasible approach.  After researching a bit, it looks like Ill need to write a custom test runner to facilitate running the tests in parallel anyways, but the parts regarding the initial test data still have me looking for a better way.p  pAnyone have any better ways of handling database initialization when running Selenium tests in parallel  p  pFWIW, the app and tests suite is in PHPPHPUnit.p  h2Updateh2  pSince it sounds like the answer Im looking for is very projectdependent, Im at least going to attempt to come up with my own solution and report back with my findings.p

Negative 8746 pOk so Im to create a code in C which outputs all the possible solutions of a board. The board is a nxn board with a row looking like this3x3 AA BA BB. p  pThe objective of the game is to visit every position in the board by only going vertically or horizontally across the board. Also, you can only go to the next position if the first or second letter is the same so I can go from AA to BA but not from AA to BB and you can only visit each position once. The starting position is always the upper left corner or the 00 position. p  pAnyway, I thought of an algorithm where the computer starts at 00 and checks the next valid position, lets say 01. Then the computer checks all possible solutions using the chain of 00 and 01 as starting positions. When theres no more, the computer checks a new chain lets say 00, 10 and so on. How do you know not to repeat the previous solutions I was thinking something with recursion. Are there more efficient pathfinding algorithms other than minep

Negative 8746 pWhat I am trying to achieve is to setup a new build controller in my laptop running on XP SP3 in domain X, with Application tier running on 2008 Server in Y domain.

On Application tier I have granted that user Admin rights and even added to TFS Administration console users. So when I logon with the local user in Y domain all TFS service are up and running.  Installing build service on XP has no issues with the local user, but when I try to start the controller or Agent it fails with  error  strongThere was no endpoint listening at that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details.strong However if I install build service on a machine in Y domain I am able to add new controller and agent without any issues. I have tried various solution suggested on net like setting IE connection properties or adding TFS machine domain trusted sites but nothing have changed so far.

Negative 8746 pMy goal is to animate my UI, and I am using UIView animations.

I have asked questions on this topic previously a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10792026multipleuiviewanimationsMultiple UIView Animationsa, and all the responders say I have to set a delegate to the animation with a method like codeanimationDidStopperformSelectorcode but I was wondering if I could instead add subviews to the main view and perform animations simultaneously on each subview.

Negative 8746 pIm trying to write my own little PNG reader in Python. There is something in the a hrefhttpwww.libpng.orgpubpngspec1.2png1.2.pdf relnofollowdocumentationa I dont quite understand. In chapter 3.3 where chunks are handled it saysp  blockquote   pFour bits of the type code, namely bit 5 value 32 of each byte, are used to convey chunk properties. This   choice means that a human can read off the assigned properties according to whether each letter of the type   code is uppercase bit 5 is 0 or lowercase bit 5 is 1. However, decoders should test the properties of an unknown   chunk by numerically testing the specified bits testing whether a character is uppercase or lowercase   is inefficient, and even incorrect if a localespecific case definition is used.p blockquote  pOk, so it explicitly denotes one should strongnotstrong test whether a byte is uppercase or lowercase. Then, how do I check that embit 5emp  pFurthermore, the documentation statesp  blockquote   pAncillary bit bit 5 of first bytebr   0 uppercase  critical, 1 lowercase  ancillary.p blockquote  pI have the following function to convert an integer to a bitstreamp  precodedef bitsx, n      Convert an integer value x to a sequence of n bits as a string.      return .joinstr[0, 1][x gtgt i amp 1] for i in xrangen  1, 1, 1 codepre  pJust for example, take the codesRGBcode chunk. The lowercase codescode denotes the chunk is ancillary. But comparing the bitstreams of an uppercase codeScode and lowercase codescodep  precode01110011 01010011 codepre  pwe can see that bit 5 is zero in both cases.p  pI think I do have a wrong understanding of counting the bits.

Negative 8746 pWe have a set of 5 online auction systems running on Windows Azure amp SQL Azure. Each system consists of a single web worker and one or more web roles. Each system is using ASP.NET MVC 3 and Entity Framework, Repository Pattern and StructureMap.p  pThe worker role is responsible for housekeeping and runs two groups of processes. One group is run every ten seconds, the other every second. Each process will likely run a database query or stored procedure. These are scheduled with Quartz.netp  pThe web role serves the public interface and back office. Among other basic crud functionality, both of these provide screens which, when open, will repeatedly call controller methods which will result in execution of stored procedure readonly queries. The frequency of repetition is about 23 seconds per client. A typical use case would be 5 back office windows open, and 25 end user windows open  all hitting the system repeatedly.p  pFor a long time we have been experiencing intermittent SQL timeout errors. Three of the most common ones arep  blockquote   pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException A transportlevel error has occurred when receiving results from the server. provider TCP Provider, error 0  An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.p      pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException A transportlevel error has occurred when receiving results from the server. provider TCP Provider, error 0  The semaphore timeout period has expired.p      pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.p blockquote  pThe only predictable scenario is during an auction where a specific controller  sproc starts to timeout during the event presumably due to load. All other times the errors appear to be completely random and come in singles, twos, and threes etc. even during periods of user inactivity. For example the system will go 18 hours without an error and then could be 5  10 errors from different housekeeping methods, or perhaps a user logged on and viewed their account.p  pOther infop  pI have tried to run the affected queriessprocs on SQL Azure using both local SSMS and Azure webbased query tool  all seem to execute quickly, 1 second max.

I have defined a custom bindingHandler lets call it rows, which defines a number of Jquery functions attributed to links based on an edit, remove, update,cancel behaviour of names in a list.p  ol lipThe user types their names, into an input bound to a knockout AppViewModel. they click the add button to add it to an observableArray, which is then outuput in the browser. pli lipOnce they have done this, they may edit the name bly clicking edit, or remove it with the remove link.pli lipif they click edit, they are shown a new div previously hidden that provides them the ability to edit their name in the text box and select update which adds the new name to the list or they can cancel which takes them back to the non editable list. pli ol  pHowever, my issue is that if the user changes their name, in the input box during the edit process and then selects cancel, the new name is still added rather than the original one. p  pI have been assured the issue is merely in this jQuery functionp  precode          element.find.cancelBtn.onclick, function                      element.find.editRow, .detailRow.toggle              codepre  pHowever Im not convinced, does the toggle or hide function submit the value in the input boxp  pthe input tag itself is bound to a namep  p  which corresponds to the appViewModel ... self.name  ko.observablep  pIn just wondering if the observable binding, being two way, is preventing any return to an original state of the name, and simply continuing to observe the updated name entered into the input box altering it before any link is clickedp

Negative 8746 phow to if even possible search for a string in a file including all its revisions p  pThe reason to do so is that I know that some string was in my file codefoo.barcode somewhere in past, but was removed since. There are lots of revisions on the file so manual search is time consuming. I need a tool that will download all revisions of the codefoo.barcode file and search for my string in each revision.p  pIf possible, Id be great to search in a directory and not just single file but also including all revisions. This is optional however.p  pThe only solution I came with is to write a python script to export revision by revision and always read the file and search for the string using a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarystring.htmlstring.find relnofollowfinda. p

Is there a more painless way to manage this going forward  I feel like we are going to run into this again and again.  p  pI have a couple of ideasp  p1. Set up the app on a private server and do all of our development directly on the server via ssh.  Is this a common approach  p  p2. Set up the app to be completely self contained.  i.e. run everything including ruby, rails and all the gems we need directly from the app folder.  If everything you need is in the project directory, seems like you could avoid problems where app works on one machine but not others due to slightly different ruby versionsgem versions etc.  p  p3. Clone my hard drive and send to my friend so that we are starting from exactly the same set up.  Is there a way to copy the contents of an entire disk partition running ubuntu and then install on someone elses computer so that they can run the os from boot  Even though were both running ubuntu we found that a lot of things that worked on my machine would not work on his and vice versa.  Very bizarre.  p

Negative 8746 pstrongUse casestrongbr I am developing a CMF on top of Symfony2. One of the features will be the support of widgets an possibility for end users to add small blocks or modules to a page. Examplesp  ul liA small login formli liA list of productsli liSome photos from a galleryli liA shopping cartli ul  pThe idea is that most of those widgets will link to to normal, full page RoutesControllers.p  pFor example a user want a list of popular products in a sidebar on a content page. The items will link to the normal productname route of the ProductController. But the list in this case would be a widget. The end user can define where it must be placed, and for example, how much items must be shown.p  pThe behaviour of the widgets is the same as regular Symfony2 controllers, it has routes, actions, it renders a view, etcetera. There is a WidgetManager with a catchall route to load the widgets, configure them and render them in the right place.p  pI have not that much experience with Symfony2, but I am playing wit it now for more then 3 months. I definitely want to stay with Symfony2, but will need to add some magic to realise some of my ideas.p  pstrongQuestionstrongbr What is the best way to support rendering multiple controllers widgets in one requestp  pstrongResearchstrongbr Symfonys TwigExtension ActionExtension contains a render method, wich contains the basic ideap  precodeltdiv idsidebargt      render AcmeArticleBundleArticlerecentArticles with max 3  ltdivgt codepre  pDocumentation a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentbooktemplating.htmlembeddingcontrollers relnofollowhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentbooktemplating.htmlembeddingcontrollersap  pBut it is quite limited.

Negative 8746 pSo, I have a domain. Lets call it emwww.example.comem for this question.  Thanks to the wonders of how I have things setup andor Wordpress, if I were to type in emexample.comem it would redirect me to emwww.example.comem and Wordpress would do its thing.  I also have a subdomain called emmembers.example.comem in which I have built a rather elaborate system using CodeIgniter into the folder strongmembersstrong off of publichtml.p  pIn a perfect world, what I would like to do is be able to put some php code into Wordpress that would allow someone reading the www side of things to be able to determine if they are also currently logged in on the members side of things.  I know the CodeIgniter session persists so that whenever I jump on to the members side, Im still logged in.  My first thought was to put together a quick page in CI that did thisp  precodepublic function isLogged      x  off     if thisgtsessiongtuserdatamemberKey  0          x  on          echo x  codepre  pThen, whenever I would run the link strongmembers.example.comloginisLoggedstrong , I would always get either off or on to determine if I was in or not.  emThe memberKey would be either 0 for not logged in, or a number based on someones corresponding key in the databaseem.  My hope was that I would be able to run something like THIS from the www side within Wordpressp  precodehomepage  filegetcontentshttpmembers.example.comloginisLogged codepre  p...and I would be able to act on whether the person was logged in or not.  Well, obviously the flaw here is that when I call the above function, Im always going to get off as my result because Im making that call from the server, and not from the client in question that needs this information.p  pWhat would be the most elegant solution to being able to read this information  Is there a way to read cookies cross platformp

Negative 8746 pI have a jQuery Cycle slideshow, consisting of images with additional text used as headline style text. The images fade in, with the text placed in divs animating in and out, roughly at the same time as the images using the before callback method. I am trying to now add previous and next controls. They work, but they immediately advance to the nextprevious slide, because the before callback is on a delay, they dont seem to be triggering the before callback. I am wondering how to get this whole system working, and have the animated text fade in at the same time as the image if I click the previous and next controls.p  pWhat is the best way to tackle this setup Am I on the right path or is there a more efficient and proper way to go about this Code below, thanks in advancep  precodeltdiv idsliderContgt     lta href idprev1 nameprev1gtPREVltagt lta href idnext1 name     next1gtNEXTltagt      ltul idslidergt       ltligt         lta hrefgtltimg srclibraryimagescartarp.jpg gtltagt          ltdiv classcaptionHiddengt           ltdiv classcaptionInnergt             lth2 idslide1headline1gtUnveiling a Revolutionlth2gt              lth3 idslide1headline2gtin Automotive Hospitalitylth3gt              lth4 idslide1headline3gtWhat Makes Us Differentlth4gt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltligt        ltligt         lta hrefgtltimg srclibraryimagespassion.jpg gtltagt          ltdiv classcaptionHiddengt           ltdiv classcaptionInnergt             lth2 idslide2headline1gtProviding the Blueprint Forlth2gt              lth3 idslide2headline2gtPerformance withltbr gt             Passionlth3gt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pNext, CSSp  precode, html, body  margin0padding 0  sliderCont  height 512px width1200px overflow hidden position relative margintop 30px webkitboxshadow 0 0 7px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.35, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 mozboxshadow 0 0 7px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.35, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 boxshadow 0 0 7px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.35, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2  slider  width 1200px height 512px zindex 1 margin 0 padding 0 background ccc overflow hidden  slider li  margin 0  div.caption  display none position absolute top 60px left 60px zindex 2 fontweight lighter   div.captionHidden  display block position absolute top 60px left 60px zindex 2 width1080px  div.captionInner position relative width1080px div.caption span.item  display inlineblock padding 10px fontsize 20px backgroundcolor 2C2C2C webkitboxshadow 0 1px 3px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0,    0.2 mozboxshadow 0 1px 3px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 boxshadow 0 1px 3px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 color E7E7E7  div.caption span.item.second  marginleft 15px margintop 5px  span.sliderhighlight  color 59b5e2   h2slide1headline1  fontsize 79pxtextalign rightfontweight normal color  353534 h3slide1headline2  fontfamily Arial Black, Arial fontsize 32pxtextalign rightfontweight bold color353534 h4slide1headline3  fontsize 18pxtextalign rightfontweight normal color 353534   h2slide2headline1  fontfamily Arial Black, Arialfontweight bold fontsize  32pxtextalignleft color ffffff h3slide2headline2  fontsize 79pxtextalign leftfontweight  normalcolorffffff codepre  pThen our jQuery for the cyclep  precodefunction      slider.cycle         fx fade,         speed 800,         prev prev1,         next next1,         easing easeOutCubic,         timeout 5000,         before onBefore           function onBeforecurr, next, opts          this.children.captionHidden.css             opacity 0,             top 0px                  this.children.captionHidden.animate             opacity 1,             top 60px         , 600, easeOutCubic.delay5000.animate             opacity 0,             top 5px         , 500, easeOutCubic       codepre

Negative 8746 pI recently wrote a .NET service that, even though it was configured to start automatically and log in as my user account, and even though according to Task Manager it was Running every time I restarted my PC, it was not.p  pI sort of fixed the problem by making sure that the Windows Event Log was set up as a dependency, but now I find that unless I restart my PC, the service does not start automatically. Task Manager and the Services snapin will say its Started, or Running, but its not. In other words, if I log off and then log in again the service is not running, even though Windows will say it is.p  pI was wondering if there is a way to fix this problem Am I missing a dependency If so, is there a general way to tellp  pAll my service uses is the Windows EventLog, System.IO.FileSystemWatcher, and my code. Almost all the action takes place inside one of the event handler procedures hooked up to one of FileSystemWatchers events. The event handler procedure is hooked up inside the services constructor. Could it be that those event handler procedures dont survive a system log off If I am on the right track here, where should I hook up the event handler procedurep

Negative 8746 pWe are developing some device and we need to find good solution for one of needed functionality.p  pThing is that we need communicate WinCE 6.0 ARM and Windows on PC. Easiest way is of course COM port but in our case it is impossible all serial ports are used on WinCE and we dont want to add one more. Second option is LAN but for us it is not the best option for few reasons.p  pSo there is third option we could use. USB to USB communication but how to do that  Of course WinCE is USB Device and PC is USB Host so all hardware basics are meet.p  pWe could use Active sync but there are few problems with it  WinCE 6.0 is not working with WMDC drivers on device just crash after connecting device with PC and I didnt find any solution for it so in this case we need to use WinXP on PC side old ActiveSync   we need to filter communication with active sync to only our application, no other non authorized software should be allowed what I know this is imposible to obtain.p  pSo propably best way to do what we need is to communicate throug USB like standard COM serial communication. The question is, how it could be made, are we need to write driver on WinCE and also a Driver on Windows PC, or there are better solution Maybe some driver for WinCE 6.0 that would emulate Virtual COM on PC side and of course allow standard ReadWrite to it on WinCE side  Could someone tell me if something like that exists p

Any suggestionsp  pI realize that, depending on the link function in my glms, Chisquared may not be the most appropriate test, but I have used F in appropriate contexts as well with similar disappointment.p  pIs this problem familiar to anybody else Suggestions Many thanksp  pExamplep  precodemakeandcomparemodels lt functionfitnesstraitname, dataframename, vectorformultipleregression, predictorforsingleregression, fam         fit1ltglmformulaas.formulapastefitnesstraitname,, pastevectorformultipleregression, sep, familyfam, datadataframename         print summary fit 1         printsummaryfit1         fit2lt glmdatadataframename, formulaas.formulapastefitnesstraitname,,predictorforsingleregression, familyfam          printsummary fit 2         printsummaryfit2         printmodel comparison stats         modtestltanovafit2,fit1          suggestion 1         printanovafit2,fit1, testChisq          suggestion 2         print significance     print 1pchisq absmodtestDeviance[2],dfabsmodtestDf[2]             dataltstructurelistID  c1L, 2L, 4L, 7L, 9L, 10L, 12L, 13L, 14L,  15L, 16L, 17L, 18L, 20L, 21L, 22L, 23L, 24L, 25L, 27L, 28L, 29L,  31L, 34L, 37L, 38L, 39L, 40L, 41L, 43L, 44L, 45L, 46L, 47L, 48L,  49L, 52L, 55L, 56L, 59L, 60L, 61L, 62L, 63L, 65L, 66L, 67L, 68L,  69L, 71L, QnWeightinitial  c158L, 165L, 137L, 150L, 153L,  137L, 158L, 163L, 159L, 151L, 145L, 144L, 157L, 144L, 133L, 148L,  151L, 151L, 147L, 158L, 178L, 164L, 134L, 151L, 148L, 142L, 127L,  179L, 162L, 150L, 151L, 153L, 163L, 155L, 163L, 170L, 149L, 165L,  128L, 134L, 145L, 147L, 148L, 160L, 131L, 155L, 169L, 143L, 123L,  151L, Survivedeclosion  c0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L,  1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L,  1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L,  1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, Dayswrkreclosionminus20  cNA,  1L, NA, 3L, 0L, 2L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, NA, 0L, 7L, 1L, 0L,  1L, 0L, 1L, 2L, 2L, NA, 2L, 3L, 2L, 2L, NA, 0L, 1L, NA, NA, 0L,  0L, 0L, 0L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 1L, 0L, 2L, NA, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 3L, 1L,  2L, MLH  c0.5, 0.666666667, 0.555555556, 0.25, 1, 0.5, 0.333333333,  0.7, 0.5, 0.7, 0.5, 0.666666667, 0.375, 0.4, 0.5, 0.333333333,  0.4, 0.375, 0.3, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.875, 0.6, 0.4, 0.222222222,  0.222222222, 0.6, 0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.714285714, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6,  0.4, 0.7, 0.625, 0.555555556, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.25, 0.428571429,  0.3, 0.25, 0.375, 0.555555556, Acon5  c0.35387674, 0.35387674,  0.35387674, 0.35387674, 0.35387674, 0.35387674, 0.35387674, 0,  0, 1, 0, 1, 0.35387674, 0, 0, 0.35387674, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,  0.35387674, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0,  0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.35387674, Baez  c1, 1, 1, 0.467836257,  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.467836257, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0.467836257, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1,  1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, C294  c0, 1, 0, 0, 1,  0.582542694, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0,  0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.582542694, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1,  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, C316  c1, 1, 0, 0, 0.519685039,  0.519685039, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.519685039, 0,  1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.519685039, 1, 0, 1,  1, 0, 0.519685039, 1, 0.519685039, 1, 1, 1, 0.519685039, 0.519685039,  0, 0.519685039, 0.519685039, 0, i120PigTail  c1, 1, 0, 1,  0.631236443, 0.631236443, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0.631236443, 1, 1,  1, 0, 0.631236443, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0.631236443, 0, 1,  1, 0, 1, 0.631236443, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.631236443, 0.631236443,  0, 1, 0, 0.631236443, 0.631236443, 1, 0.631236443, 0.631236443,  1, i129  c0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L,  1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L,  0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L,  0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, JackstrawPigTail  c0L, 1L, 1L, 0L,  1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L,  1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L,  0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, NeilYoung  c0.529636711,  0, 1, 0, 0.529636711, 0.529636711, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1,  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,  1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, Ramble  c0, 0, 0,  0, 0.215163934, 0.215163934, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,  0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.215163934, 0,  0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0.215163934, 0, 0, 0, 0, Sol18  c1,  0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0.404669261,  1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, .Names  cID, QnWeightinitial,  Survivedeclosion, Dayswrkreclosionminus20, MLH, Acon5,  Baez, C294, C316, i120PigTail, i129, JackstrawPigTail,  NeilYoung, Ramble, Sol18, class  data.frame, row.names  cNA,  50L  makeandcomparemodelsQnWeightinitial, data, cAcon5,Baez,C294,C316,i120PigTail,i129,JackstrawPigTail,NeilYoung,Ramble,Sol18, MLH, gaussian codepre

Negative 8746 pSo, I know you should not call an intent from a nonActivity class, let alone an intent with a result. A nonActivity class simply shouldnt do that and be responsible for whatever its supposed to do.p  h3What I haveh3  pNow, I have a codeNappingActivitycode, which displays a dozen buttons, implemented in codeVideoButtonViewcode. These buttons extend codeandroid.widget.Buttoncode.p  pI want to be able to drag and click the buttons, so I implemented the drag  click logic in the codeVideoButtonViewcode, by settingp  precodethis.setOnTouchListenernew View.OnTouchListener    codepre  pAnd when a user clicks the button inside codeonTouchView v, MotionEvent eventcode, the following is calledp  precodeContext context  v.getContext Intent showVideo  new Intentcontext, ViewActivity.class context.startActivityshowVideo codepre  pSo far, so good.p  h3What I wanth3  pNow, this intent returns to the codeNappingActivitycode, but Id like to separare this video playing intent by returning a result. So, ideally, Id call this codestartActivityForResultcode from the codeNappingActivitycode, and not the codeVideoButtonViewcode, because the latter isnt possible anyway.p  h3Questionsh3  ul lipHow do I go about refactoring this, so I can handle the click from within the activity rather than the button, or at least send the intent from therepli lipShould I move the whole click and drag logic to the activity Doesnt sound very clean.pli lipCan I implement some kind of custom listenerspli ul

Negative 8746 pI am building an application with a GUI and several worker threads. Now I want it to be a multithreaded application so I am executing the same thread several times, in a loop, each thread grabbing different input parameters defined in a class outside of the thread.p  pSo my mainGui.py file looks something like this relevant code shown onlyp  precodeself.workers  [worker.Worker, worker.Worker, worker.Worker] for i in xrangethreadCount     self.currentWorker  self.workers[i]     self.currentWorker.alterTable.connectself.alterMainTable     self.currentWorker.start     time.sleep0.1 codepre  pAs you may imagine, I am connecting the Workers codealterTablecode signal to the codealterMainTablecode method I have defined in my main GUI thread. This method updates the table in the GUI.p  pThe worker thread looks something like thisp  precodeclass WorkerQThread      alterTable  Signaldict      def initself, parentNone         superWorker, self.initparent      def sendToTableself, param1, param2, param3         This method emits the signal with params as defined above         params           params[param1]  param1         params[param2]  param2         params[param3]  param3         self.alterTable.emitparams      def runself         Perform a lengthy task, do this every now and then         self.sendToTableparam, param2, param3 codepre  pWhen I am running this application in a single worker thread so when Im not calling that loop in the main thread, it works fine  the signals are emitted, and the main table in the GUI is updated.p  pHowever, the problems arise when I run several threads at once. The Worker threads do their job, but the Signal is only emitted sometimes. Or, better yet, it is emitted as if Qt or whatever was waiting for all the threads to finish, and then update the table. This is literally what happens  I can see in Python console that the threads are performing their tasks, and once strongallstrong of them are doing whatever they were doing, the table is suddenly populated with a bunch of data at once. p  pAs you may imagine, another problem that comes out of this is that since there are no events being processed, after some time, my application appears to be frozen.p  pI have tried adding the codeQt.DirectConnectioncode to the codeconnectcode method, but that didnt really help.p  pBonus question Ive been reading about this topic on SO and other websites, it seems that people recommend codeQRunnablecode instead of codeQThreadcode especially when it comes to subclassing it. Consequently, Id be using codeQThreadPoolcode. But when I tried this, it seems that I cannot emit a signal from a codeQRunnablecode  it gives me the codeAttributeError PySide.QtCore.Signal object has no attribute connectcode, even though the Signal is defined within the QRunnable class  which is quite odd, I must say. p  pstrongEDITstrong In another answer on SO, someone mentioned that one may be spamming the main GUI thread with events to be processed. However, I dont believe that this is the case here as the codesendToTablecode method from the QThread is only called 56 times at most from the thread, and the codethreadCountcode is never larger than 20 at most, but I usually keep it at around 5.p
Negative 8746 pI know there are a lot of related questions, I have read them but still have not gained some fundamental understanding of how to readprocesswrite. Take the following function for example which uses codeclojurecsvcode library to parse a linep  precodedefn takecsv   Takes file name and reads data.   [fname]   withopen [file reader fname]     doseq [line lineseq file]       let [record parsecsv line] codepre  pWhat I would like to obtain is data read into some collection as a result of codedef data takecsv file.csvcode and later to process it. So basically my question is how do I return coderecordcode or rather a list of records.p
Negative 8746 pI am working on a Symfony2Doctrine app which uses classtableinheritance httpdocs.doctrineproject.orgen2.0.xreferenceinheritancemapping.htmlclasstableinheritance to manage Complaints in a Consult. Each Consult can have many Complaints OneToMany, and each different type of Complaint has a different structure and appearance. Complaints are a collection and are added dynamically with JS.p  pAt this point, I am able to persist the Complaints and link them to the Consults by recasting them as the appropriate types in the Controller before persistence. I have run into some issues with this and Im planning on migrating this to a form event httpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbookformdynamicformgeneration.html or something of that nature to streamline the process.p  pThe problem that I am running into at this point, however, is that I am unable to display existing Complaints in a view using the FormView because the form builder demands that I set the type of the collection to be displayed. If each Consult had only one type of Complaint, that would be fine, but they can have multiple types, and setting the type in the form builder limits me to that one type.p  pIs there some approach that I can take to stop the FormView from tyring to convert to string in the absence of a type or some way to dynamically detect and assign the type on a perComplaint basis using complaintgetComplaintType, perhapsp  precodeltphp namespace AcmeConsultBundleEntity class Consult             ORMOneToManytargetEntityAcmeConsultBundleEntityComplaintBase, mappedByconsult, cascadepersist, remove           protected complaints  gt   ltphp namespace AcmeConsultBundleEntity    AcmeConsultBundleEntityConsultBase     ORMEntity   ORMTablenameConsultComplaintBase   ORMHasLifecycleCallbacks   ORMInheritanceTypeJOINED   ORMDiscriminatorColumnnamecomplaintname, typestring   ORMDiscriminatorMap    ComplaintDefault       AcmeConsultBundleEntityComplaintDefault,    ComplaintRosacea       AcmeConsultBundleEntityComplaintRosacea,    ComplaintBotox         AcmeConsultBundleEntityComplaintBotox,    ComplaintAcne          AcmeConsultBundleEntityComplaintAcne,    ComplaintUrticaria     AcmeConsultBundleEntityComplaintUrticaria,      abstract class ComplaintBase             ORMManyToOnetargetEntityAcmeConsultBundleEntityConsult, inversedBycomplaints       ORMJoinColumnnameconsultid, referencedColumnNameid           protected consult            ORMColumntypestring, length255           protected complaintType  gt   ltphp namespace AcmeConsultBundleFormType class ConsultType extends AbstractType      public function buildFormFormBuilder builder, array options              builder             gtaddcomplaints, collection, array                  type gt new ComplaintUrticariaType,                 errorbubbling gt true,                 allowadd gt true,                 allowdelete gt true,                 byreference gt false,                    gt codepre

Negative 8746 pZIP entries store the full path name of the entry because Im sure of the next part the ZIP archive is not organized as directories. The metadata contains the info about how files are supposed to be stored inside directories.p  pIf I create a ZIP file in Windows, when I unzip the data in another OS, e.g. Mac OS X, the file structure remains as it used to be in Windows. Is this because the unzipper is designed to handle this, or isit  because the file separators inside the ZIP are standardp  pIm asking this because Im trying to find an entry inside a ZIP file using the name of the zipped file.

Negative 8746 pIve built a trivia game using PHP and javascript. Since each question has a time limit, Ive not provided a submit button instead, the user can directly submit the answer by pressing the Enter key. After the enter key is pressed, the user is redirected to another URL which checks if the posted answer is correct, adds 10 points if the answer is correct and then updates the database with the users points and then redirects the user to the trivia page where they have another question to answer. However, when a user enters the right answer and presses the enter key multiple times without letting the page reload, their answer is deemed as valid by the script and their points are added as any times as the answer was submitted. So, if I hit the enter key 40 times after typing in the right answer, it adds 400 points.

Negative 8746 pI am working on a project that basically consists of complicated form containers repeated in an ngrepeat. Each of these forms has enough functionality that it could easily be its own angular app, but instead they are repeated on the screen, and there can be up to 30 of them. p  pWith 5 or more of these on the screen, performance becomes very slow. Although I tried to disbale some of our heavier features, it seems that the big performance wins just come from disabling the uninteractable scopes. p  pI am looking for a good pattern to freeze the unused scopes. I want them to maintain their state, but I dont want them to listen or be attached to anything until the user focuses on the form that they apply to.    p

I do have AutoPostBack on. Do I need some kind of codebehind for the second textbox as wellp

Negative 8746 pYou have an xml schema, which you run through the XML Schema Definition Tool xsd.exe to auto generate your classes.  You can then programme against that to populate the classes  serialise to an XML document  validate against the original XML schema all great.p  pBut what happens if that xml Schema changes every week. I do not want to keep on going in and making code changes every time a new version of the schema is released.  Is there a general technique in dealing with this type of problemp  pI had thought about analysing the schema, and producing a mapping class which will allow end users to map new properties found within the schema to columns within the database.  But then creating a method to loop through this, and use reflection to map the data onto the auto generated classes is difficult with large schemas.p

Negative 8746 pAt the moment I try to figure out how Spring Security evaluates the given URL, expression and annotations. So far it seems like it always checks the entries from codesecuritycontext.xmlcode first. And if thats a codedenyAllcode it will simply stop further processing of the request.p  pMaybe I forgot to set some configuration option, but in my eyes its not possible to build a nice whitelist using Spring Securitys annotations like codeSecuredcode, codePermitAllcode, etc..p  pWhat I want is basically to annotate the methods inside a codeControllercode for strongallowingstrong access. For examplep  precodeController RequestMappingtest public MyController      RequestMapping     public void tryToGetSomething         no security annotation gt denyAll           RequestMappingpublic     PermitAll     public void tryToGetSomethingPublic         this will always have access allowed           RequestMappingadmin     SecuredROLEADMIN     public void tryToGetSomethingReallyImportant         this can only be accessed by admins       codepre  pThe main reason for this approach is Security codecode. Its always possible to forget some annotations while writing code. And with this method such a mistake wont affect security of sensitive data.p  pSo my question is How can I achieve thisp

Negative 8746 pWe have noticed that with the 2012 NetSuite Web services and perhaps all other versions, when we make a call from a .NET 2.0 64bit application, if the response does not come back quickly, then intermittently our application will hang however in the NetSuite application logs it appears the SOAP call was successful. The hang eventually times out timeout after 5 minutes  because NetSuite or something keeps the socket open, it just stops sending packets.p  pWe ran a Network Trace and noticed packets coming out of order, being dropped, inexplicable duplicate acks  etc. Essentially, it freaks out. Microsoft techs have never seen anything like it  least the ones I talked too.p  pWe ran a simple test app that does nothing more than passport in, then do a query for Accounting Periods. Its the search method that hangs as its parsing the SOAP response  always gets about 10s in.p  pAs soon as we target a 32bit environment, everything works like a charm, even though the 32bit binary is running on a 64 bit OS. Clearly, running as a 64bit app sets some network protocol configuration that NetSuite really doesnt like.p  pWe tested on Azure, Amazon and on a local to our corporate network Windows 2008 R2 SP1 64 bit servers  physical and VMs.p  pWe dont have hard evidence of the why this is happening, but after a month of pulling our hair out were all bald now we think weve stumbled upon an issue. This one is so weird, however, Im not willing to go out and claim that its still not something were doing. So, if you dont believep  ol liOpen Visual Studio 2010 and create an .NET 2.0 console application targeting Any CPU.li liDo a Add Web reference... and add the NetSuite WSDL.li liCreate a simple passport login and do a search that returns something with some volume.li lipRun the EXE on a 64bit OS, several times this bug is intermittent, during peak working hours i.e. appears around 7am  2pm PST. p  pThats exactly what we did. If you go back and create a new x86 target and rebuild the project, it works fine.pli ol

Negative 8746 pThis has been a bit of a head scratcher for me. In an app Im building I am using a UITextField, and adding a button as the leftView property. However, it seems that on an iPad both sim and on device, the button is receiving touches that are well outside its bounds. This is interfering with the ability of the UITextField to become the first responder when the user touches the placeholder text. It seems that when touching the placeholder text, the events are being handled by the button instead of the text field itself. Strangely, this only appears to happen on iPad it works as expected on the iPhone.p  pHere is some simple code demonstrating the problemp  precode voidviewWillLayoutSubviews       [super viewWillLayoutSubviews]      UITextField textField  [[UITextField alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake10.0f,                                                                            10.0f,                                                                            self.view.frame.size.width  20.0f,                                                                            35.0f]     textField.borderStyle  UITextBorderStyleRoundedRect     textField.placeholder  Test text     [self.view addSubviewtextField]      UIButton addButton  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeContactAdd]     [addButton addTargetself actionselectortouchDown forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchDown]     [addButton addTargetself actionselectortouchUpInside forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]     [addButton addTargetself actionselectortouchUpOutside forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpOutside]     textField.leftView  addButton     textField.leftViewMode  UITextFieldViewModeAlways        voidtouchDownidsender      NSLogtouchDown    voidtouchUpInside      NSLogtouchUpInside    voidtouchUpOutside       NSLogtouchUpOutside   codepre  pIt seems that sometimes touches are still perceived as being inside even though they appear to be outside the buttons bounds.

Negative 8746 pI have an app that has a very lengthy registration form filled with all sorts of Spinners and checkboxes and younameits.  Im presenting them all for clarity in a ViewFlipper and offering them to the user one at a time.p  pOn all the handset devices that Im testing this on, it works perfectly.  However, when running on a Samsung Galaxy Node 2 the latest one, the keyboard grinds to an unusable glacial pace, with keys taking multiple seconds to respond.  This appears to be directly connected to the spinners that are NOT displayed but are part of the layout because when I remove those particular Layouts from the Flipper everything speeds up dramatically, though still not back to what youd expect from a late generation Android tablet.  p  pIs there something I should know about app performance when dealing with a ViewFlipper that has many child layouts  The layouts themselves are pretty simple... just a few Views each, except for the Spinners, some of which have tens of AdapterViews as selectable items.p  pI realize this question is somewhat vague, but I dont really know what to do, other than to refactor my code to load the Flippers children 1 at a time and dismiss them when theyre out of sight, which is a colossal hassle that Im hoping to avoid, especially given that it works brilliantly on all the other devices Ive tested this on.p  pI turned on harware accel in the manifest as a last ditch attempt, but, as expected that didnt do anything helpful. p

codepre  pThe dataset is the timeseries of dye concentration at 24 locations. Each station has 24 data points hourly. Hence, in the first line of the data, 24 means number of data points for that station and codei5,j529, Depth Avgcode means the codeidcode of that station and data is depth averaged. For simplicity we can treat the first location as 1 and the last location 24. I want to plot the graph such that time series of each station is plotted as the box plot and another linecurve is plotted which joins the median points for all the data. The location of 24 points is defined as  codedist lt c0,1850,seqfrom3100,to29350,by1250code . It means the starting point is at 0 and second point is at 1850 metres and all other stations are 1250m apart. p  pExpected plotp  pDistance Vs Dye concentration showing box plot for each locations amp curve joining median of 24 data points at each station. p
Negative 8746 pI know this question is a bit vague and not sure this is even possible. On my web site I want to display a combo box with maximum possible languages available in unicode and when the user selects the language respective  character map of that language should be loaded. Then users can click and complete the given text area with their comments in their own language. I am not asking for the code but a kind guide line about the possibility of this and a way to do this will be really helpful. My ultimate need is to give user to type in any language of their choice. Do the users need to install the language in their computer before using it Thank you.p

If yes , will it compile .tt files in to service exe or do we deploy .tt files seperately  Also can be be used in a web application p
Negative 8746 pSo basically, I have 8 items these images are not stored on my database but on img folder on my index page. When user clicks on a specific item, the whole image should be displayed on productsdetails.html . But I believe theres no control structure in markup language so I should do it with PHP. I really dont have an idea to achieve this thing.  Any ideas or suggestions to help me I would really appreciate any help. Thanks.p

Negative 8746 pWe are maintaining a large website based on Lotus Notes, running on Domino Server 8.5.3. Recently we have been fed up with the lack of source control in our project, so we thought we would try to Git things up a little. But how to do this rightp  pFor various reasons that I will not get into here, we cannot run our applications locally on the development PCs. We can only run them on the development, staging and production servers. Local Domino server running on the development PCs is not an option, unfortunately.p  pThis figure illustrates the current situationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBDj4r.png altCurrent situation. Oh, the horror...p  pIn production and staging there are multiple web sites that all have the same functionality. They are basically the same site with the same design, but with different content. Each site consists of a number of Notes databases News, Archive, Discussion etc. The design of these databases is the same for all sites, so they all inherit their design from the same set of master templates NewsTemplate, ArchiveTemplate, DiscussionTemplate etc.p  pA set of replicas of the master templates resides on the Development server. When we deploy new functionality, the required code changes are added to the templates on the Dev. server more details on this below. Then these templates are replicated to the Staging server for testing, and finally to the production server. This part works quite well.p  pThe problems may be found in the lower part of the figure. We are currently two developers, and we both work in the same set of dev. databases News, Archive, Discussion etc on the dev. server. Naturally we keep tripping over each others work, which is quite frustrating. When it is time to deploy, the code that is to be deployed is selectively copiedpasted from the set of dev. databases to the dev. templates. This is done manually, and thus the risk of mistakes is high. We cannot simply replace the design of the templates with that of the dev. databases, because the dev. databases at all times contain code that is under development. So we must take great care to only deploy code that is finished. Also, we have no history of changes. This is a horrible, horrible, horrible add as many horribles as you see fit way to do software development, and we know it.p  pNow, using Git, local replicas, database copies or whatnot, what would be the best way to achieve a more streamlined development and deployment schemep

Negative 8746 pIm reworking my terrain renderer, now it uses gpu tessellation with shaders, with a projected grid style approach grid centered the and positioned around the camera by finding the nearest gridpoint behind it, at making it as the center.skytigers approach a bit reworked It runs well until I turn off the reposition method, and go to the edge of the grid.p  pSince the tessellation algorithm is under testing, I use a simple distance from camera type tessellation, the outer tess factors are depend on the distance of the edge center points from the camera, and the inner from the quad patch center point from the camera. When I move around I runs pretty well, but when Im near the edge of the grid, in my case at 0,0,0 I get a terrible lagg.p  pI use VBOs, VAO, heightmap sampler in tessellation shader, no frustum cullingyet, no tessellation culling out of screenyet, my map width is 2nGRIDSCALE, n and GRIDSCALE depends on the frustum. I tested it with map of 81928192. The average fps with camera unlockednot centered is about 6070, but around P0,0,0 its 815.p  pI rendered the whole test grid without cpu LOD, only with gpu tessellation.p  pWhat could possibly cause thisp  pstrongEDITstrong I encountered this kind of lag when I made my first ever heightmap, it was the simple static grid with triangle strips with VBO and index array. When I moved the camera to the center of the map, it was not 0,0,0 or the upper half in the z axis in the z direction, and looked down the z axis I got the lag.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJXGLV.png altenter image description herep  pThis is the laggy point of view. Around 0,0,0. Elsewhere it runs smooth.p  pstrongEDITstrong Point strongisnt at 0,0,0,strong I just didnt take into account the emvertex shader transformem, so the strongterrain quad center is 0,0,0strong and the bottom right corner is MAPWIDTH,0,MAPWIDTHthe corner in the pic At the other corners there is not any lagg.p

Negative 8746 pAm trying to Learn Tkinter. The following program works fine. It creates a textbox and a scrolllbar connected to the textbox. There is also a button, which when pressed inserts a line into the text box. Now what I want to do is to move the scrollbar such that when the text goes beyond the first screen, the scrollbar automatically scrolls down so that the user sees only the last line of the input. What I want to do is for the text box to behave like an extended stats window, so that the user is able to see the progress so far. Right now the user will continuously have to scroll down by using the scrollbar to the last line. I want this process to be automatic. Is there a command which I can use to do thatp  pThanksp  precodefrom Tkinter import   root  Tk  def checkFn     text.insertEND,  gt The check button has been pressed ... n   ...............

Negative 8746 pI have spent quite a bit of time scouring the overflow forums and using other resources to try and figure this out without success. My apologies if this has been answered elsewhere. But, to my knowledge it hasnt p  pHere is a little background. I have some experience with SQL, Visual basic and Auto Hot Key awesome program. Currently I am trying to learn more than the basic stuff I know about SQL little rusty too.p  pFor my previous and current job I worked a lot with IBMs iSeries or Mainframe as some veterans like to call it. Specifically its version IBM DB2 PE 9.7 FP5 SRM R1 on the DB2 i5OS. p  pAs you may know, iSeries related emulators have a feature that allows its users to record macros for later playback. This feature of course has its limitations. I have written some from scratch in Visual Basic that are more flexible in the operations that they can perform. However, you can only do so much with VB.p  pRegardless of how you look at it, iSeries is slow IMO. In order to passretrieve information tofrom its databaseserver its users are limited to the speed of the program among other things. VB macros are subject to smart pausestimeouts as these are needed for scripts to work like auto hot keyp  piSeries does have a feature where you can query information, interact with libraries schemas if I have that right and tables using the i5OS Query manager. It also has an FTP feature which has its uses I guess. I have started playing around with Powershell and SSHQshell, I have read a lot of documenation in IBMs extensive support section on their site regarding iSeries and all things related. p  pstrongSo here are the questionsstrongp  ol lipIs qshellSSH an efficient way to retrieve information from a database, or more specifically, the libraries that DB2 for iSeries uses .lib.file extension filespli lipWouldnt writing SQL scripts and executing them via SSHQshell be faster than using the iSeries emulator itselfpli lipIs this only possible via port forwarding or tunnelingpli lipHow do I find out more about the server via SSH commands I can navigate the servers directories pretty easily and view files that I otherwise cannot see within iSeries. Its database files are .lib.file.mbr file extensions that I cannot view using the cat command. This would require using SQL commands I am assumingpli lipDo I need to log on as a root user in order to have readwrite access privelages and perform anything SQL relatedpli ol  pAs mentioned above I have played around with sshqshell but I am having difficulty bringing up the mysqlsql prompt to do anything I am using openSSH 4.7p1  a unix CLI which I believe changes from  to  when you successfully do this. I have been able to do this but am unable to execute any SQL related commands so I am not sure what I am doing wrong.p  pBelow is an example of me logging into the server over ssh via powershell and trying to execute something SQL relatedp  pPS H ssh 1 myusernameblabla.something.com mysql u myusername e show tablesp  penter password passwordp  pconnectedp  pCould not chdir to home directory homemyusername A file or directory in the path name does not existp  pbsh mysql execute permission deniedp  pbsh cannot executep  pConnection closed to blabla.something.comp  pstrongThis is an example of just logging in over ssh as normalstrongp  pssh 1 myusernameblabla.something.comp  pCould not chdir to home directory homemyusername A file or directory in the path name does not existp  p Mysqlp  pmysql execute permission deniedp  p mysqlp  blockquote   pshow databasesp blockquote  pmysqlp  pshow databases not foundp  pAny insight as to what I am doing wrong or feedback on my questions is greatly appreciated. I know there are alternatives to what I am trying to do using PuTTY not really an option at work, ODBC drivers cant really download an IBM iSeries fixpack to get the drivers or repair the installation of iSeries as I cant anyways I dont have Windows admin privsp  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr First, I want to thank you all for your comments and your insight. p  pstrongWarrenstrong Thank you, for you insight. IBM DB2 PE 9.7 FP5 SRM R1 is indeed DB2 LUW, or COBRA. This particular emulator is an adaption of IBMs 3270 emulator. This knock off brought to you by attachmate they added a couple bells and whistles and no longer offer support, ODBC drivers etc. Within this version, I have the option to utilize IBM DB2 Query Manager for i5OS. I would agree that the server is partitioned I think as I have been able to call different prompts like DB2SQLJJAVA, just havent been too successful with using them lol. Perhaps my attempts below will reveal a little more.p  pstrongJamesstrongbr Thank you for your input, I never thought to do this from powershell directly. As for the redbook, have it Im still reading it though. This may be a little more advanced than where I currently stand with powershell and ADO.NET. I will need to take a more in depth look at your coding example to gain a better understanding of it.p  pstrongBuckstrongbr I appreciate your point by point feedback. Not sure what your setup is, but IBM i in general especially anything after i5 is insanely fast. The company I work for.. or at least the immediate people I work with, know very little in regards to ivbaqshetc. To put it politely. So, much of what I have learned has been through reading and applying what I learn. This, actually, is only my second post. On any website, ever. I dont like to just post away because I cant figure something out in a minute. Im stubborn and will spend hours if I have to make a script work.p  pAs for STRSQL, the equivalent I use is STRQRY. From reading IBMs i5OS Query Manager PDF 300 pgs . I would agree that this is a very powerful tool. The only drawback is 1. you have to make a form that will format the query and 2. You have to create the Query using SQL   . This is no big deal whatsoever. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of schemas, and sometimes  thousands of .FILE extensions within any given LIB among other extension types. Luckily I have narrowed this down to the primary LIB that I access most. Unfortunately, there are something like 4000 files extensions within this library and files within some of those files    . Going through all of them is a little time consuming to say the least.p  pThere are some macros that perform a query in batch and then prints the data to a formatted file onto the server which takes erm... like 30 mins for 500600 pages. Is there any way I could view the parameters of this batch run Work with queriesquery forms p  pThe primary reason I am more so interested in using QSHSQL to perform a query and navigate a database is due to the fact I would like to improve my SQL skillz beginner but I would like to be able to apply this knowledge to other environments in the future.p  pGod, I write too much sp  pstrongMy recent effortsstrong I am sorry.

Negative 8746 pWhat is the difference between returning by pointer and returning by reference In both cases, the address is returned to the caller, am I rightp  pAccording to this little program  its obviously the same  it prints the value of an integer.p  pAre the any limitations concerning returning by reference rather than returning by pointer My teacher tells us  when you return by reference to a receiver, the receiver borrows the object.

Negative 8746 pI am in the midst of creating a workout log for a team of mine. What I currently have is a MySQL query written in PHP that retrieves an array of user ids associated with posts made in the current week. The code is as followsp  precodemysqlquerySELECT uid FROM posts WHERE id IN SELECT pid FROM postgroups WHERE gid . group[id].  AND date gt  . dstart .  AND date lt  . dend .  codepre  pTo better explain this, say a user with codeuid  6code posts five workouts this week. The array generated by the above query should contain code6code a total of five times. This is done for every workout posted by users in the week  so I end up with a large array full of duplicate user ids.p  pWhat I am looking to do is, instead, return an array of size 10 that contains the codeuidcodes that appear most frequently in the array above. So, if codeuid  6code appeared the most frequently in the above array, lets say 10 times, and codeuid  8code appeared the second most frequently, lets say 9 times, then the array that I wish to return would have a value of code6code at [0] and a value of code8code at [1], etc.p  pI am not sure how to trim down this array and sort it by most frequent occurrences of codeuidcode, as my SQL skills are a little lacking at this moment. I was hoping someone would be able to shed some light on the ideal query that I am looking for. I appreciate your helpp

Negative 8746 pIn the book emOracle Database Conceptsem, Oracle gives an example to explain codeRead Committed Isolation Levelcode. p  pIn the example, transaction 1 updates row 1, then transaction 2 updates the same row before transaction 1 commits.

Negative 8746 pI saw a post similar to this one that had a solution that would be more of a work around to this issue than a solution.p  pWe are moving SQL from 2008 to 2012.  There was a process already in place that cannot be changed.  Basically the application takes queries stored in the DB runs the queries on a schedule and then in some cases returns the results and sends them in an HTML formatted email.p  pThe problem is that the current application when sending an email using SQL 2008 returns the date formatted as mmddyyy hhmmss AM but using the exact same code on the 2012 server we get yyyymmddTHHMMSS.000 with military time and a T in the middle of the date and time.p  pThe solution I saw in the other post said to format the date like this in the queryp  precodeconvertnvarchar, startdate, 121 As [startdate] codepre  pWhich works...but this would require changes to all of the hundreds of queries that are currently stored in the data.  It is working in the current production environment with SQL 2008...but the new app using SQL 2012 changes the date format.  On another site I saw someone with a similar issue, but they were using 2008 and the issue happened while still in 2008.  No real resolution there either.p  pIs there a setting perhaps that we may be overlooking  The client does not want us to change the code unless we absolutely have to.p  pSo an example query stored in the DB would bep  precodeSELECT startdate FROM basetable codepre  pA stored procedure then runs the query and returns the results as XML p  precodeSET sql  query   FOR XML RAW  EXECsql codepre  pwhich are stored in a varcharmax field in the data.p  pAnother stored procedure takes the XML from that field and puts HTML tags around the XML datap  precodeltTABLEgt  XML  ltTABLEgt codepre  pThen sends the email using dbmail.p  pResults in the email for SQL2008 would bep  h2startdateh2  p10152004 100 PMp  p10212005 525 PMp  pResults in the email for SQL 2012 would bep  h2startdateh2  p20041015T130000.000p  p20052121T172500.000p  pConvoluted I know...but thats what we have to work with.p  pThanksp

Negative 8746 pIn my app I am constantly getting and putting data to my database.  In fact what I desire to do is to run three separate threads to do so.  I do not think I have a thread problem as in my DDMS I can monitor the threads opening. But what I think I am failing to grasp is the Database instances.  For example I have a method which shall construct a filename.  That filename is made up of the value in a cell of one table    value of a cell in another table.  So I have this method calling two other methods each with the task to go to the database and get that value.p  pProblem is that I am not sure how I should open an instance.  Below you see that for each method I am opening a separate instance of the same database and then closing it.  In this AsyncTaskRunner class I have many methods of the same as below which are doing their own task, but open a different instance name for the same database each time.p  pThis to me seems very wrong.  I would imagine that as soon as the class opens I could open ONE single instance of the database and then not close it until Destroy so that all methods can do their thing.p  pWhat can I do betterp  precodepublic String evaluateATableString filenamePrefix      SQLDatabase getATableData  new SQLDatabasemContext     getATableData.open      String aRowId  SQLDatabase.evalATablefilenamePrefix      getATableData.close      ifaRowId  null         return aRowId          return null       public String evaluateLTableString filenamePrefix      SQLDatabase getLtabledata  new SQLDatabasemContext     getLtabledata.open      String lRowId  SQLDatabase.evalLTablefilenamePrefix      getLtabledata.close      iflRowId  null         return lRowId           return null  codepre

Negative 8746 pI am currently using NDesk.Options to manipulate my command line arguments. The problem I encountered now is that when I run with multiple flags, the computation is done in the order the flags appear. But this is not always what I want. For example for these argumentsp  pt 20 g mailGroup p  pI want first the g flag to be computed which loads a mailGroup data and just after it to compute the t 20 which is top 20 of some analysis. This works g mailGroup t 20p  pAlso, my t 20 will not work if nothing is loaded, so basically the g mailGroup is a needed option before t 20.p  pIs there an elegant way to provide priority of evaluation for these flags  Also maybe dealing with the cases that one flag requires the existence of a subset of another flags to be computed before it like for example I have multiple ways and forms of loading, not just g. p

Negative 8746 pCoin Change is a pretty popular problem which asks how many ways you can get to a sum of N cents using coins C[0], C[1]...C[K1]. The DP solution is to use the method sN, K  sN, K1  sNC[K1], K, where sN,K is the amount of ways to arrive at a sum N with the first K coinssorted in ascending order. It means the amount of ways to make N cents using the first K coins is the sum of the amount of ways to arrive at the same sum without using the Kth coin added to the amount of ways to arrive at Nthe Kth coin. I really dont understand how you can come across this solution, and how it makes sense logically. Could someone explainp

Negative 8746 pHi I have made a doubly linked list container. For a project I now have to turn the doubly linked list into a square list. What I mean by square list is that the data will be stored in a square. So for example 4 elements would be stored like thisp  p10 30p  p20 40p  p5 elements would be stored like thisp  p10 30 50p  p20 40p  p10 elements would be stored like thisp  p10 40 70 100p  p20 50 80p  p30 60 90p  pBasically the number of rows or columns cannot exceed the square root of the ceiling of the size of the list. What it is meant to do is if there is a large number of data it can insert or erase that data quickly by traversing the columns until it finds the column that the value would be inserting or deleting and then traversing the list from that point until it finds the proper spot to do the insertion or deletion.p  pWhat I am thinking about doing is to have the data stored in the doubly linked list and then have a doubly linked list that represents the columns. So each node in the column list will point to where a node in the row list that should represent a column header. How would I go about implementing thisp  pHere is my doubly linked list containerp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std  template lttypename Tgt class doubleLinkList       typedef typename stdsizet        sizetype  private     struct rowNode          rowNode prev         rowNode next         T data         rowNode  prevnullptr, nextnullptr            struct columnNode          columnNode prev         columnNode next         T data         columnNode  prevnullptr, nextnullptr            struct       rowNode head     rowNode tail     unsigned count  0  public     doubleLinkList     doubleLinkList      void insertT value      sizetype size const  return tail  head      sizetype maxsize  return stdnumericlimitsltsizetypegtmax       bool empty const  return head  tail    template lttypename Tgt doubleLinkListltTgtdoubleLinkList      head  nullptr     tail  head   template lttypename Tgt doubleLinkListltTgtdoubleLinkList      while head              rowNode tmp  head         head  headgtnext         delete tmp        template lttypename Tgt void doubleLinkListltTgtinsertT value      rowNode node  new rowNode     nodegtdata  value       Case 1 There are no nodes yet     if head  nullptr          head  node         tail  head         count         return            Case 2  Inserting at the head of the list     if nodegtdata lt headgtdata              nodegtnext  head         head  node         count         return            Case 3  Inserting at the end of the list     if nodegtdata gt tailgtdata              nodegtprev  tail         tailgtnext  node         tail  node         count         return            General case  Inserting into the middle     rowNode probe  head     while probe ampamp nodegtdata gt probegtdata              probe  probegtnext          if probe              nodegtnext  probe         nodegtprev  probegtprev         probegtprevgtnext  node         probegtprev  node         count         return           return   template lttypename Tgt bool operator  doubleLinkListltTgt constamp lhs, doubleLinkListltTgt constamp rhs      if lhs.size  rhs.size         return false     auto lhp  lhs.begin     auto rhp  rhs.begin     while lhp  lhs.end          if lhp  rhp             return false          return true   template lttypename Tgt bool operator lt doubleLinkListltTgt constamp lhs, doubleLinkListltTgt constamp rhs      auto lhp  lhs.begin     auto rhp  rhs.begin     while lhp  lhs.end ampamp rhp  rhs.end          if lhp lt rhp             return true         if lhp gt rhp             return false         lhp         rhp          if lhp  lhs.end ampamp rhp  rhs.end         return true     return false   template lttypename Tgt inline bool operator  doubleLinkListltTgt constamp lhs, doubleLinkListltTgt constamp rhs      return lhs  rhs   template lttypename Tgt inline bool operator gt doubleLinkListltTgt constamp lhs, doubleLinkListltTgt constamp rhs      return rhs lt lhs   template lttypename Tgt inline bool operator lt doubleLinkListltTgt constamp lhs, doubleLinkListltTgt constamp rhs      return lhs gt rhs   template lttypename Tgt inline bool operator gt doubleLinkListltTgt constamp lhs, doubleLinkListltTgt constamp rhs      return lhs lt rhs   int main      doubleLinkListltintgt list     list.insert10     list.insert20     list.insert15     list.insert25  codepre

Negative 8746 pI am trying to understand the concept of speed in a game which supports different screen sizes in android. p  pLets say I have a Sprite that should take 10 seconds from the right end in landscape mode to the left end. The emFrame Rateem is not steady so sometimes its 30 for a while and then all of a sudden it changes to 10. But I still want my Sprite to take 10 seconds from one end to the other. How would I do thatp  precodefinal int time  10 time from one end to the otehr float baseSpeedX  screenWidth  time float currentFrameRate  30.0 just as an example float baseFrameRate     50.0 the frame rate we want float factor  baseFrameRate  currentFrameRate playerSpeedX  baseSpeedX  factor codepre  pstrongThis is what I understoodstrongbr You get the embase speedem by dividing the emscreen widthem by the emtimeem you want to get the sprite from one end to the other. The embase speedem is the speed your Sprite should add to your emcurrent locationem every second if a steady framerate is available. However, I dont know how to achieve that so I just get the emcurrent frame rateem and divide the embase frame rateem, the frame rate we really want for our game, to get the factor we multiply our embase speedem with. p  pThis would, if it really works, make the Sprite reach the other end in 10 seconds, right Even if we have a frame rate of 10 for 2 seconds and then 50 after that for 8 seconds. The higher the frame rate now, the lower the Sprite increases in distance and the lower the frame rate, the higher the Sprite increases in distance.p  pIf this all works, would it be something I could use in a game Or is it totally wrong approach for getting the sprite speedp

Negative 8746 pIm using Backbone to create a site where users would interact with content bookmark, star, etc and I want a way to store the content a user has interacted with in the user data. Simple enough, but Im looking for info on the best approach here.p  pI have built a prototype without user accounts data is loaded into localStorage, so the content itself stores the user interaction right now in the metadata of that content, but to open this up to more than one user at a time, I want to change it so that once a user saves a piece of content, the ID or something permanent of that content gets saved into the user account data instead.p  pIm currently using the localStorage adapter and I load the content in on page load, but with Backbone, the ID of the models changes each time. Once I move to a REST db with user accounts, Im not sure how to save the piece of content the user has interacted with in their account details object and be able to reliably use that in the UI.p  pAny help pointing me in the right direction would be great.

But now I have another question related to this problemp  pHere in my job we make these patch reports every week. So, there are new patches and applied patches every week. Im building a webpage where the users our employees can log in, select one customer, an initial date and a final date and via ajax I load the requested data. Everything is working well, the webpage is done, so is the log in system. The problem is If an user selects only 2 dates the initial and the final, how can I get information on the data in the middle of both dates For example, lets say the user logs in and selects the dates 20150202 and 20150223. Assuming the database has data for both dates and also for the dates between them, which are 20150209 and 20150216, how can I use these queries you guys showed me to make the same kind of comparison but for EACH week In the example above, Id need to get the number of new and applied patches between 20150202 and 20150209, then 20150209 and 20150216, then 20150216 and 20150223 and finally 20150302, instead of 20150202 and 20150302.  I tried to create some kind of loop with php to loop through the dates in mysql and codeforeachcode date I ran a query and summed up the numbers I got, in order to display the final count in each case, but it didnt work. Can anybody help mep
Negative 8746 pHow do I create sandbox environments on Mac OSX for running different program  projectsp  pLet me envision a scenario for you. Say, I want to achieve three things from my computer simultaneously 1 Work on an open source project that requires a particular set of configurations such as GCC4.6, Python 2.6 etc. to run  test etc. 2 Work on another open source project which gives its full functionality when running GCC4.8 or greater, Python 3.x etc. to run  test etc. 3 Listen to iTunes in the background.p  pNow, configuring the environment for the first two things is not easy and messes things up. What is even more hard is finding an intersection of combinations that can run both.p  pI achieve this by running VMWare and creating a new virtual machine for each open source project  configuring it to work with the projects requirements. However, this is not scalable. Is there a better way to achieve sandboxing I have a 2.53 GHz dual core processor with 16GB memory.p

Negative 8746 pIm working in Pentaho 4.4.1GA Kettle  PDI.  The database is Postgres.p  pI need to be able to insert emmultipleem records into a fact table based on the fields that come from a emsingleem record.  The single record contains fieldsp  precodeproductcode1, price1 productcode2, price2 productcode3, price3 ... productcode10,price10 codepre  pSo if there was a value for each of the 10 productcode  prices then Id need to insert a total of 10 records into the fact table.  If there were values for 4 of the combinations, then Id need to insert 4 records into the fact table, etcetera.  All field values for the fact records would be identical emexceptem for the PK generated by sequence, product codes, and prices.  p  pI figure that I need some type of looping construct which would let me check whether or not a value was present for each productx field, and if so, do an insertupdate step on the fact table with the desired field values.  Im just not sure how to do this in Pentaho.p  pAny ideas  All suggestions are welcome p  pThank You,p  pRakeshp

Negative 8746 pI was just about to write my hundredth login form when a thought crossed my mind Why do I need a usernamep  pA while ago my dad had to change his emailaddress, and he still didnt figure out, why he cant log into various websites with his new address. Im also not a huge fan of individual persite usernames. And wouldnt it be easier to remember only a passwordp  pWhat are usernames good for You obviously need some unique string to identify a user by. If you had just the password, that would work until a user picks a taken password and you would have to tell him Sorry, GreatPassword123 already belongs to another user  bad idea.p  pSo part of the password needs to be unique. My idea strongPredetermine the first three charactersstrong You could choose from lower and uppercase letters and digits, providing 2626103  373,248 unique prefixes. At registration, the user would get a dialog, telling him that he only needs a password, and it starts with N0i for example, he has to pick the rest deaWhy comes to mind. He can then log in with his password only, being N0ideaWhy, not knowing or caring that N0i actually is a unique username.p  pI see the following pros and consp  h2Prosh2  ul liindependence from emailaddressesli liuser needs to remember just one stringli limight reduce password reuseli lisafe from leaked lists li lifaster login through fewer keystrokesli ul  h2Consh2  ul lineed to split the passwordstring and submit the first three characters unencrypted while hashing the restli liscalability comes to a dead stop at 373,248 users or 26.8 million if you use four charactersli liusers might be skeptical  unexperienced  thrown off by not being able to reuse their standard password li ul  pIm really wondering why nobody else did this so far Are there any concerns that I missedp

Some of the values are missing amp hence represented by blank in these 4 columns. I want this data set to be reduced to below format p  pThere should be 1 row for each year amp correspondingly other columns should contain mean of the values for respective year. Ex.  In case year 2005 has 6 rows in total with 2,6,2,6 nonnull values for those 4 columns.  Then output row for year 2005 should be arrived at by  sum of values for rows with year 2005 divided by 2,6,2,6 respectively. above example contains NAs hence if 2005 is working fine it can be assumed that steps will work fine in other cases as wellp

Negative 8746 pI have been working in Visual Studio for a while now and have come to love intellisense.

That way, if I were say trying to reference a RelObj I could have Intellisense remind me that TableA is supposed to be equivalent to the codeNamecode Property of the TblObj that holds the RelObj, while TableB is the table being related to.p  pIf not, its not like I havent gotten by without it thus far, but it would be nifty and a way to avoid mistakes.p

Negative 8746 pIm working on a project that is suppose to send a file from one machine to another using DatagramPackets and DatagramSockets. The implementation is suppose to mimic the TCP protocol. So once the receiver gets a packet it sends back an ACK to the sender, confirming the packet was delivered. My program so far without making any checks for ACKs. Im having trouble implementing the ACK messages. On my receiver program, it shows that the ACKs are being sent, but the sender application is not getting them.p  pI keep getting an error from creating the socket. java.net.BindException Address already in use Cannot bind.

Negative 8746 pThis question is more to help my understanding of Yesod than anything else.  Take the example at a hrefhttpwww.yesodweb.combookbasics relnofollowhttpwww.yesodweb.combookbasicsa and in particular the code generated by the emmkYesodem strongTHstrong function.p  pThe problem that I perceive is that this strongTHstrong generates both the route data type emdata Route HelloWorld  HomeRem and the emyesodDispatchem function which calls emgetHomeRem etc.p  pThe difficulty there is that in a larger project you cant split out the definition of emgetHomeRem into a separate module because Haskells simple module system is strictly hierarchical  so if emgetHomeRem simply called emgetHomeRimplementationem which were defined in another module say strongHomeImplementationstrong then that module would need to import the definition of emdata Route HelloWorldem and there would be a circular dependency.p  pIt seems to me that this could be avoided if the emRenderRouteem, emParseRouteem and emYesodDispatchem instances could be declared in separate modules  then emRenderRouteem could be at the bottom of the importation hierarchy, and emYesodDispatchem, at the top.  Does that make sense   Maybe the fact that I ask this question shows that I dont understand something about the emmkYesodem strongTHstrong  e.g., that there is some crucial interrelationship and they should not be separated.p

With this solution, Ive added a foreign key codeidcustomitemcode in my table codeuserlistitemscode which give the followingp  precode  id  iduserlist  iditem  idcustomitem  number     1             6        3               0       2    2             6        0              25       1    3             6        7               0       5    4             7        7               0       3    5             9        3               0       1   codepre  pAnd now I have a problem with codeuserlistitemscode because can link to codeitemcode or to codecustomitemcode and it seems like a very bad practice.p  pMy question is, how could I save users custom input with a list of predetermined item br Sorry this question is not very well formulated but I couldnt find any other way to express it.p

Negative 8746 pIs it safe to shorten this usage of the ternary operatorp  precodeprocessptrptr  ptr  defaultptr codepre  pwith the shortcircuitp  precodeprocessptrptr  defaultptr codepre  pin C and C In other words, are we guaranteed to get emeitherem codeptrcode emorem codedefaultptrcode back from the experssion, or is it perhaps allowed for the expression to result in an arbitrary logical true value, if the expression is logically truep  pThis is the kind of code youd see all over Perl code, but I rarely see it in CC, thats the original basis of my question.p

Negative 8746 pIm making an application that has one codeMainUsercode class that should be accessible throughout the application. For example, the codeMainUsercode class has the variable codefullNamecode that contains a String with the full name of the user.

It doesnt seem very efficient in my mind, so Im wondering if there is some global method to do it although I searched this up and found that global variables are rather unstable and unpopular.

Negative 8746 pI am working with a neo4j database currently and need to be able to have a query check if a date property in a node is before or after the current date.

How could I get neo4j to do a query where it checks if currentDate  dateProperty  meaning the current date is after the date in the date propert if neo4j doesnt support dates  I would prefer not to change the format, unless there was a way to store the date in a format that neo4j can use but display it as mmddyyyy.

Negative 8746 pIs it possible to produce multiple intermediate SHA256 values that could somehow be combined at a later time to produce the same SHA256 that would be produced from a single hashing computationp  pIn other words, if I hash a 4GB .ISO image file for a SHA256 value one day, could I produce the same single SHA256 by splitting the file into, lets say 10 sections, producing an intermediate SHA256 for each section, and then at a later time, produce the final SHA256 using only the intermediate SHA256 valuesp  pI realise there is probably no way to produce 10 intermediate SHA256 values from 1 final SHA256 value but I thought it might be possible to hash a file in chunks and combine those 10 intermediate SHA256 values at a later time without needing the actual data at the same time.p  pIf this is possible, how would I produce the final SHA256 from the intermediate SHA256 values in C andor JavaScriptp  pstrongEditstrong I want to take away the requirement of the intermediate values being SHA256 values.p  pI dont care what they are as long as I can produce a final SHA256 at a later time using only the multiple intermediate values and no data.

Negative 8746 pI have a C library that provides an IO device interface including an implementation for files. It also provides a UTF8 string class. Now, I just need to read a line from this codeIODevicecode.

I dont mind using stdlib in fact, I prefer it, but I do need to read the line from my codeIODevicecode and return it as my codeStringcode. p  pNow, the specific question if I read the file byte by byte, is it safe to assume that any byte with value codencode is in fact a new line symbol, and not the trailing part of some different multibyte symbolp

Also, refreshing doesnt help. This happens only on Safari.p  pOne thing i noticed is that the local storage usage increases on Safari every time i call codeAV.Player.fromURLcode and it does so on Chrome too, but the player does work on Chrome after the first method calls. p  pI supose the problem is related to the way browsers cache these files after they were first requested.

The apps user will input data anywhere from once a week to multiple times a day. This information must be stored locally on the device and, through a paid option, in the cloud. The information to be stored will be mostly text but with some amount of videos and images.  p  pThe user should be able to access this data via a website or the mobile app. They should be able to share it with specified users, manually or automatically. p  pThere will be two types of user. One will have access to only their own data and the other will have access to multiple users data. The later will be able to run operations on this data to get graphs and comparisons etc.  p  pThat is 99 of the functionality the app will need from the backend. My question boils down to can firebase do the above or would I be better off with the likes of Heroku. My main reason for thinking firebase is its great support in the ionic community and its high recommendations.  p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 8746 pWe have a backend C Solution which provides web services. And a frontend website which accesses the backend.p  pBoth of them should be deployed automatically on one server for testing.p  pDeploying the backend is no problem  I can use the TFS Build for building the projects and deploy them to the server.p  pBut how can I deploy the frontend website It is not integrated in any Solution or Project in Visual Studio. Because it is just simple HTML, JavaScript etc. and doesnt contain any ASP code or something. The only place, where I can find the website files, is at the Build Server in the local src folder.p  pSo the only options I see is one of the following 1. Access the src folder on the Build Server via BatchFile. Or 2. Create a new project that contains all the website Filesp  pBoth of them do not look as a proper solution. The first one because I think its bad practice to pick my own files out from the buildserver. The second because I would have to add every file manually to this project.p  pAny better ideas or experiencep

Negative 8746 pI am wondering what the benefits are for the skelton amp content implementation of MPI functionalities such as provided in Boost.MPI. As far as I understood is the skeletonampcontent approach ONLY beneficial if a message has a fixed size of arbitrary type and this message needs to be sent several times with different content.p  pSo skeletonampcontent does not work in the following casep  precodestdlistltintgt l   Exchange Skeleton mpiskeletonl   Send Content mpicontentl but modify the size of the list, so sending once 10 element and in the next time 2 elements, for example codepre  pBoost sends the content by serializing the data, and deserializing it on the other end.  I assume it will send the data with type MPIBYTE and handling the endianess with flags somehow p  pTwo questionsp  ol liWhy the need for sending the skeleton for any serializable type can also be a serialization wrapper object Can Boost not just deserialize given the same serialization wrapper which provides deserialization the received data without the need of the skeletonli ol  pSo the skeltonampcontent approach is beneficial in the sense that dynamic sizes of lists etc.. do NOT need to be serialized again in subsequent calls. So the real benefit is that the serialized message sending content is smaller with the skeletonampcontent approach. And if the message is sent several times this is beneficial.p  pSo to conclude, if the message is highly dynamic shape changes and only one message is sent skeletonampcontent should not be applied.p  pIs that correctp

Negative 8746 pHow can I set onclicklistener for images in a gridview to place them in a gridview in another activityp
Negative 8746 pIm using jquerybootgrid to display events to the user. Because of events could have different states Ive added an additional filter as dropdown where the user can select the status.p  pIn the codejQuerycodeclickhandler I remove all rows which do not match the selected state withp  precodevar rowsToRemove  [] var clickedLink  this var selectedType  clickedLink.dataeventstatus var currRows  eventBootgrid.bootgridgetCurrentRows  for var idx  0, rowCount  currRows.length idx lt rowCount idx      var theRow  currRows[idx]     var status  theRow[EventStatus]      if selectedType  Official ampamp status  Official          rowsToRemove.pushtheRow[EventId]        eventBootgrid.bootgridremove, rowsToRemove codepre  pwhich is working as expected.p  pThe user has also the ability to reset the status back to codeAllcode. emQuestionem How can I reset the filters so all rows are displayed againp  pI would show all rows first and afterwards remove all which do not match the selected status. If status is set to codeAllcode no row would be removed.p  pFrom the docs Ive only found codeeventBootgrid.bootgridsearch, code which is desribed as p  blockquote   pSearches in all visible columns for the given phrase. If no argument is    passed, it will reset the search. This method is chainable.p blockquote  pBut I dont want this behaviour because this would reset any searchphrase which has been set by the user.p
