Positive 1381 pThe requirement is that, I need to write an ArrayList of integers. I need threadsafe access of the different integers write, read, increase, decrease, and also need to allow maximum concurrency.p  pThe operation with each integer is also special, like this  Mostly frequent operation is to read  Secondly frequent operation is to decrease by one only if the value is greater than zero. Or, to increase by one unconditionally  Addingremoving elements is rare, but still needed.p  pI thought about AtomicInteger. However this becomes unavailable, because the atomic operation I want is to compare if not zero, then decrease. However the atomic operation provided by AtomicInteger, is compare if equal, and set. If you know how to apply AtomicInteger in this case, please raise it here.p  pWhat I am thinking is to synchronized the access to each integer like this p  precodeArrayList ltIntegergt list  ... ...  Compare if greater than zero, and decrease Integer n  list.getindex boolean success  false synchronized n      if ngt0  n successtrue     To add one Integer n  list.getindex synchronized n      n    To just read, I am thinking no need synchronization at all. int n  list.getindex.intValue codepre  pWith my solution, is there any sideeffect Is it efficient to maintain hundreds or even thousands of synchronized integersp  pThen another thing is to implement the operation of adddelete, that it is threadsafe, but do not impact much of the concurrency of the other operations. I am thinking ReadWriteLock, for adddelete, need to acquire the write lock, for other operations change the value of one integer, acquire the read lock.  Is this a right approachp

Positive 1381 pThe specifics for this question are for a mod for Minecraft. In general, the question deals with resizing a threadpool based on system load and CPU availability.p  pI am coming from an Objective C background, and Apples libdispatch Grand Central Dispatch for thread scheduling.p  pThe immediate concern I have is trying to reduce the size of the threadpool when a CMS tenured collection is running. The program in question Minecraft only works well with CMS collections. A much less immediate, but still of interest, is reducing the threadpool size when other programs are demanding significant CPU specifically, either a screen recorder, or a twitch stream.p  pIn Java, I have just found out about deep breathbr Executors, which provide access to thread pools both fixed size, and adjustable size, with cached thread existence to avoid the overhead of constantly recreating new threads, or to avoid the worry of coding threads to pause and resume based on workload,br Executor no s, which is the generic interface for saying Now it is time to execute this runnable,br ExecutorService, which manages the threadpools according to Executor,br ThreadPoolExecutor, which is what actually manages the thread pool, and has the ability to say This is the maximum number of threads to use.p  pUnder normal operation, about 5 times a second, there will be 50 high priority, and 400 low priority operations submitted to the thread pool per user on the server. This is for highpowered machines.p  pWhat I want to do isp  ol liWork with lesspowerful machines. So, if a computer only has 2 cores, and the main program two primary threads, plus some minor assistant threads is already maxing out the CPU, these background tasks will be competing with the main program and the garbage collector. In this case, I dont want to reduce the number of background threads it will probably stay at 2, but I do want to reduce how much work I schedule. So this is just How do I detect when the workload is going up. I suspect that this is just a case of watching the size of the work queue I use when Executors.newCachedThreadPoolli ol  pBut the first problem I cant find anything to return the size of the work queue ThreadPoolExecutor can return the queue, and I can ask that for a size, but newCachedThreadPool only returns an ExecutorService, which doesnt let me query for size or rather, I dont see how to.p  ol start2 lipIf I have enough cores, I want to tell the pool to use more threads. Ideally, enough to keep CPU usage near max. Most of the tasks that I want to run are CPU bound disk IO will be the exception, not the rule concurrency blocking will also be rare. But I dont want to heavily overschedule threads. How do I determine enough threads without going way over the available corespli lipIf, for example, screen recording or streaming activates, CPU core usage by other programs will go up, and then I want to reduce the number of threads as the number of threads go down, and queue backlog goes up, I can reduce the amount of tasks I add to the queue. But I have no idea how to detect this.pli ol

Otherwise players will experience different states of the same game effectively breaking the game logic. Determinism is required for game replays as well. And it is useful for other purposes where it is important that each run of a simulation produces the same result every time given the same starting conditions and inputs.p  pstrongUpdating and rendering at individual speedsstrongp  pThis is really a prerequisite for full determinism as you cannot have the simulation depend on rendering speeds ie the various monitor refresh rates, graphics adapter speed etc.. During optimal conditions the update speed should be set at a certain fixed interval eg. 25 updates per second  maybe less depending on the update type, and the rendering speed should be whatever the clients monitor refresh rate  graphics adapter allows.p  pThis implies that rendering speed higher that update speed should be allowed. And while that sounds like a waste there are known tricks to ensure that the added rendering cycles are not wastes interpolation  extrapolation which means that faster monitors  adapters would be rewarded with a more visually pleasing experience as they should.p  pRendering speeds lower than update speed must also be allowed though, even if this does in fact result in wasted updating cycles  at least the added updating cycles are not all presented to the user. This is however necessary to ensure a smooth multiplayer experience even if the rendering in one of the clients slows to a sudden crawl for one reason or another.p  pstrongNo blocking on shared resourcesstrongp  pIf the other criterias mentioned above are to be implemented it must also follow that we cannot allow rendering to be waiting for updating or vice versa. Of course it is painfully obvious that when 2 different threads share access to resources and one thread is updating some of these resources then it is impossible to guarantee that blocking will never take place. It is, however, possible to keep this blocking at an absolute minimum  for example when switching pointer references between queue of updated object and a queue of previously rendered objects. p  pSo...p  pMy question to all you skilled people in here is Am I asking for too muchp  pI have been reading about ideas of these various topics on many sites. But always it seems that one part or the other is left out from the suggestions Ive seen. And maybe the reason is that you cannot have it all without compromise.p  pI started this seemingly common quest a long time ago when I was putting my thoughts about it in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11403359thoughtsaboutrenderingloopstrategiesThoughts about rendering loop strategiesap  pBack then my first naive assumption was that it shouldnt matter if updating and reading happened simultaneously since this variations object state was so small that you shouldnt notice if one object was occasionally a step ahead of the other.p  pNow I am somewhat wiser, but still confused at times.p  pThe most promising and detailed description of a method that would allow for all my wishes to come through was this a hrefhttpblog.slapware.eugameengineprogrammingmultithreadedrenderlooppart1 relnofollowhttpblog.slapware.eugameengineprogrammingmultithreadedrenderlooppart1a A threestate model that will ensure that the renderer can always choose a new queue for rendering without any wait except perhaps a microsecond while switching pointerreferences. At the same time the updater can alway gain access to 2 queues required for building the next state tree 1 queue for creatingupdating the next state, and 1 queue for reading the previsous  which can be done even while the renderer reads it as well. p  pI recently found time to make a sample implementation of this, and it works very well, but for two issues.p  ul liOne is a minor issue of having to deal with multiple references to all involved objectsli liThe other is more serious unless Im just being too needy. And that is the fact that extrapolation  as opposed to intrapolation  is used to maintain a visually pleasing representation of the states given a fast screen refresh rate. While both methods do the job of showing states deviating from the solidly calculated object states, extrapolation seems to me to produce much more visible artifacts when the predictions fail to represent reality. My position seems to be supported by this a hrefhttpgafferongames.comnetworkedphysicssnapshotsandinterpolation relnofollowhttpgafferongames.comnetworkedphysicssnapshotsandinterpolationa And it is not possible to implement interpolation in the threestate design as far as I can tell, since it requires the renderer to have readaccess to 2 queues at all times to calculate the intermediate state between two known states.li ul  pSo I was toying with extending the threestate model suggested on the slapwareblog to utilize interpolation instead of extrapolation  and at the same time try to simplify the multireference structur. While it seems to me to be possible, I am wondering if the price is too high. In order to meet all my goals I would need to havep  ul li2 queues or states exclusively held by the renderer they could be used by another thread for readonly purposes, but never updated, or switched during renderingli li1 queue or state with the newest updated state ready to switch over to the renderer, when it is done rendering the current sceneli li1 queue or state with the next frame being builtupdated by the updaterli li1 queue or state containing a copy of the frame last builtupdated. This is the same state as last sent to the renderer, so this queuestate should be accessible by both the updater for reading the previous state and the renderer for rendering the state.li ul  pSo that would mean that I should keep at all times 4 copies of render states to be able to keep this design running smoothly, locklessly, deterministically.p  pI fear that Im overthinking this. So if any of you have advise to pull me back on the ground, or advises of what can be improved, critique of the design, or perhaps references to good resources explaining how these goals can be achieved, or why this is or isnt a good idea  please hit me with them p

Positive 1381   pGreetings everyone,p  pI am developing a strategy game in C and while I was working on UI behaviour, I thought about a construction that allows code being written like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeThis is running in a parallel thread.  Vector2 targetPosition  UI.ChoosePosition waits for position being picked tank.GoTotargetPosition instructs the tank to go to that position codepre  pThe code above is running in a seperate thread than the main UpdateDraw loop. For clarity I will call the thread with the UpdateDraw loop the main thread, and the thread that runs the above code will be called parallel thread It is never actually run simultaneously to the main thread  a construction of semaphores allows me to give the control to the parallel thread and back to the main thread as soon as the parallel thread is waiting. As long as the parallel thread is working, the main thread is waiting.p  pThe current thread stops when ChoosePosition is called and continues when a position is picked and the main thread allows it to continue running. All this works great, and I am quite content how clean the code looks. You can simply read it from top to bottom, which is far worse when such behaviour is programmed into an Update method that runs in a loop.p  pYou see that I dont actually need threads for this  I just want to have multiple stacks at once. The part about threads that cares about speeding up programs through parallel code execution is irrelevant for me. I guess that this causes some overhead, as I have to wait for the OS to switch to the parallel thread and back. I am not quite sure how much overhead though.p  pNow I thought about using a similar construction for unit behaviour, which would allow me to write code of similar cleanness, e. g. like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeShooting behaviour of the tank. Again, this is running in a parallel, but synchronized thread. whiletarget.IsAlive ampamp tank.IsDisrupted      tank.TurnTurrettargetDirection suspends current thread until turret is turned correctly     tank.WaitForShotReady suspends thread again     tank.Shoot     soundSystem.StartSoundEffecttankshooting     particleSystem.EmitParticlestank.TurretMuzzlePosition  codepre  pThe problem is that this would require an own stack for every active unit, and that means an own thread for every active unit. Aditionally, as stated above, I fear some OS overhead from the thread switching. This leads me to my first questionp  h2Is there a class in the .NET framework that allows me to have a seperate stack without having the overhead of a threadh2  psupsubStack obviously referring to the call stack, and not to the data structure.subsupp  pAFAIK the strongThreadPoolstrong and strongTaskstrong classes which internally either uses a new thread or the ThreadPool are not suited for longrunning tasksthreads as they provide a limited number of threads and therefore a limited number of stacks. According to MSDN, a task marked as longrunning just creates a thread in the background.p  pOf course I benchmarked the performance implications of running a lot of threads that are not in the readyqueue. It turns out that they are quite acceptable the creation of 10k threads takes a bit under a second, and as I can reuse threads for new units once an old one dies, this performance overhead comes only at loading time. The frame time overhead of 10k threads seems to be about 12 ms per frame although I tested with a very high framerate, Im not sure how this scales, which isnt that great, but probably acceptable, considering 10k units will require a lot of performance anyway and therefore be more like the upper bound of units existing simultaneously.p  pAnd before you ask yes, memory consumption was a few hundred megabytes, but thats relatively low compared to the memory the rest of the game requires. Its not designed for lowend computers anyway  p  pSo my result is basically Performance overhead is not great, but acceptable even with threads. But The performance was terrible like, literally a hundred times worse when I ran the benchmark with Visual Studio debugging, because the VS 15 UI displays all the threads and a lot of threadrelated events. I like this behaviour in general, because it makes debugging multithreaded applications much easier, but when displaying emtheseem threads, performance is kill. So my second question which would be answered by the first one, too isp  h2Is there a possibillity to hide a thread from Visual Studioh2  pYou might now argue that threads are not made for mass production and constant blocking, and that this approach is an abuse of threads. That might be true, but there are several reasons against thisp  ol liMy task manager shows me more than 1.5k threads running right now, while just having a browser and Visual Studio open. This doesnt seem to cause any performance issues, and I bet that most of these threads are not in the ReadyQueue but are currently blocking. I cant look it up in the Windows task manager, but when using htop on Linux its visible that most threads are not actually doing anything. Not only my benchmarks, but the system I use everyday shows me that having a lot of idle threads in the background is no problem at all.li liMSowned Windows Forms works in a kind of similar way when a dialog box is opened, the current thread stops, but certain OS threads keep the window semiresponsive make noise when clicked. This requires a vastly smaller amount of threads though.li liEven if threads are not really designed for this use case, they might still work just fine. If you say dont use threads, they arent made for this, I would prefer a reason that refers to the properties of the concept or implementation of the thread, and not to the incentive of the author of threads  because an incentive alone doesnt neccesarily break anything li ol  pI guess that I am not the only person on earth encountering this kind of situation. Is there maybe a pattern that could be applied here p  pI know that I could probably use some scripting engine. But I really like C and its ecosystem, and I would like to not have even more external dependencies.p

Positive 1381 pSo, Im using a Hibernate DAO with Spring. My DAO is going to be constructed by the ApplicationContext IOC container, and the SessionFactory is going to be injected by the container LocalSessionFactoryBean.p  pNow, this DAO is going to be a singleton, used for all CRUD operations in my program, with a pool of database connections behind it. My concern is about the thread safety of the sessionFactory field.p  pMy understanding of thread safety is that all state fields need to be guarded in a multithreaded environment. Now, the use of this class will be that Spring will set the SessionFactory upon bean creation, and that factory wont be changed after that. This means that TECHNICALLY it could function safely in a multithreaded environment, but I feel thats a very risky practice, to just operate on the assumption that the setter method wont be called again.p  pThe thing is, synchronizing the SessionFactory would require all calls to it to be synchronized as well. So the insertPortfolio method I put in below would need to be synchronized as well, which defeats the purpose of having a pool of available connections to the database, since access will be limited to one thread at a time.p  pI guess the best solution I can think of is to change this from setter injection to constructor injection, and make the SessionFactory field final.

Positive 1381 pI want to have a list of objects that satisfies just a few basic requirements. It needs to support fast random access and it needs to be safe to use from multiple threads. Reads will dominate by far and ideally should be about as fast as normal codeArrayListcode access, i.e. no locking. There is no need to insert elements in the middle, delete, or change the value at an index the only mutation required is to be able to append a new element to the end of the list. More specifically a caller will specify an index at which an element should be placed, and the index is expected to be only a few more than the length of the list, i.e. the list is dense. There is also no need for iteration.p  pIs there anything that supports this in Java It can be in a third party library.p  pIf not I am thinking I will implement my own class. Therell be an internal array of arrays, each twice as big as the last. Lookups by index will do just a little more maths to figure out which array has the right element and what the index in that array is. Appends will be similar unless they go beyond the available space, in which case a new array is allocated. Only the creation of a new array will require a lock to be acquired.p  pDoes this sound like a sensible approachp  pThis doesnt sound like a particularly novel data structure. Does it have a namep

Positive 1381 pI observed an odd behavior when using the Ping class. After creating and launching a number of instances via .SendAsync... from within a thread that hosts a Form, I am waiting for a List from which each instance removes itself in the method called by the PingCompleted event getting empty, but this never happened because the callback method never got executed, until I inserted an Application.DoEvents in the waiting loop.p  pI discovered that the callback method is executed in the same thread that called .SendAsync, which of course explains why the callback didnt work. If I first create another thread and call .SendAsync there, or do this in a console project, the callback is alternately executed in one of a small number of different threads, none of them being identical to the thread that called .SendAsync.p  pSo why does the behavior of Ping.SendAsync and probably others regarding thread creation depend on whether there is a Form associated to the invoking thread or not I thought maybe to save the programmer the need of checking .InvokeRequired when accessing a Control from a callback method, but I prefer utilizing .InvokeRequired.Invoke in these methods that actually involve interaction with FormsControls, rather than not even having the method executed because of deadlock.p

Positive 1381 pSuppose I have a kernel in which I first bring in the neighbors of a vertex from a CSR graph representation into the shared memory.

Positive 1381 pIn my understanding, heres how MRI 1.9 GIL worksp  ol liInterpreter spawns a new thread by calling the corresponding underlying C function and ask to acquire the GIL.li liIf GIL is free, we are happy. If not, the new thread will wait and invoke another separate timer thread to set up timesliceli liWhen current executing thread hit some boundaries such as return or checking backward branches, interpreter checks the timer to decide if context switch should happen.li ol  pHowever, as pointed by this a hrefhttpwww.jstorimer.comblogsworkingwithcode8100871nobodyunderstandsthegilpart2implementation relnofollowarticlea, we can only guarantee atomicity for pure C implementing. That being said, if some parts of our thread contains ruby code, we are still in danger of race condition.p  pMy question is if a thread needs to acquire GIL before executing, why only C implementation methods guarantee atomicityp  pThank you in advancep

What this means is that you have at all times 300 threads available for blocking database actions or 300 requests per second at max also if I had more resources to the server like more Ram,CPU or cores does that increase the amount of threads available For example if I buy a server that has 4 cores or etc.. would the available threads jump to 1,200  As stated before all my actions are blocking from user registration to user chats so trying to get my misconceptions out now before they become more costly.p

Once the start method of first object is called, it waits for the thread to run. When it runs, it invokes the run method which in turn starts the for loop.

Negative 1381 pI am trying to create a unique CDKEY to put in our products box, just like a normal CDKEY found in standard software boxes that users use to register the product.p  pHowever we are not selling software, we are selling DNA collection kit for criminal and medical purposes. Users will receive a saliva collection kit by mail with the CDKEY on it and they will use that CDKEY to create an account on our website and get their results. The results from the test will be linked to the CDKEY. This is the only way that we will have to link the results to the patients. It is therefore important that it does not fail p  pOne of the requirements would be that the list of CDKEYs must be sufficiently spread apart so that there is no possibility of someone entering an incorrect CDKEY and still having it approved for someone else kit, thereby mixing up two kits. That could cost us thousands of dollars in liability.p  pFor example, it cannot be a incremental sequence of numbers such asbr 00001br 00002br 00003br ...br The reason is that if someone receives the kit 00002, but registers it as 000003 by accident, then his results will be matched to someone else. So it must be like credit card numbers... Unless a valid sequence is entered, your chances of randomly hitting a valid number is 1 in a million...p  pAlso, we are selling over 50,000 kits annually to various providers who will generate their own CDKEYS using our algorithm so we cannot maintain a list of all previously issued CDKEYS to check for duplicate. The algorithm must generate unique CDKEYs.p  pWe also require the ability to verify that the CDKEY is valid using a quick check algorithm, so that we can inform the user if the code he enters is invalid. This leaves out many hashing or MD5 algorithms I believe. And it cannot be a 128 bit because, who would take that time to type it out on the computer screenp  pSo far this is what I was thinking the final CDKEY structure would look likebrbr 4 char product code  4 char reseller code  12 char unique, verifiable CDKEYbrbr Ex. 384A  GTLD  4565  FR54  EDF3brbrp  pbr To insure the uniqueness of the KEYS, I could include the current date 20090521 as part of the source. We wont generate unique keys more than once a week, so this value changes often enough for the purpose of unique initial value.p  pWhat possible algorithm can I use to generate the unique keysp

Negative 1381 pI am using NHibernate with FluentNHibernate for my DAL. I am also using codeSchemaExportcode and codeSchemaUpdatecode to create and update my database schema.p  pMy problem is that the schema operations all require the database to exist before they will work. I want to programmatically create my database and update the schema as there may be multiple databases and the creating of the database is not only a onceoff operation.p  pI know I can do this manually by executing a create database command on a connection to the master database, but this feels wrong considering that I otherwise use NHibernate for all my database interactions. As an aside, I use a SQLite inmemory database for my unit tests so any sql I write will then have to know which database Im using.p  pIs there any way to get NHibernate to create my database for mep

He wants to know which ads perform the best, on which sites, and how long we retain our new visitors, if at all. That is, hes not satisfied simply knowing that our ad campaign brought in X new visitors, what he wants to know is where they came from, what they did, and if they bought anything. p  pAs I said in the short version, I know that most of this is available in the log files, but is this the best way to go about it or should I use the backend php system to track this information and store it in the db in real time Does there already exist a generally accepted method p  pTracking a users progress is a topic that has always interested me, but until now Ive never had the the time to delve into it. If anyone has some advice on even where to begin, I would greatly appreciate it. p

Negative 1381 pSimple situation. Im trying to write my own blog with a minor twist. Part of the blog will be controlled from a client application instead of a web interface. Basically, Im still in the design phase and havent written a single line of code. emBut Im trying to combine several techniques into an interesting exercise in software development.em Thus I want a client application which I can use to write articles in, which can then upload the article through a web service to the server. The client would be Delphi 2007WIN32 and the service is ASP.NETC with SQL Server.p  pThe article itself would be stored in RTF format, including images. This would be in a local database on the client, which would also keep track of the articles status. Once uploaded, it will keep the article synchronised with the version on the server. Technical details are just boring and as said before, still in a design phase...p  pBut I do need a good solution to convert the article from RTF in the database to HTML to be displayed in the blog. I have two optionsp  ol liUpload both the RTF and HTML from the client, with the client doing the convertion from RTF to HTML.li liUpload just the RTF and let it convert on demand on the server. Or convert on the server when the RTF is uploaded.li ol  pOption 1 would need a DelphiWIN32 solution to convert it while option 2 would need a .NET solution for the conversion. I dont want an RTF editor for .NET but need a good option to use in Delphi 2007. And I need something to convert an RTF to HTML, which would keep almost all formatting and which would include all images from the text. This could be both in .NET or Delphi.p  pSo, I have the following questionsp  ul liIs there a good, free RTF editor for Delphi which can handle imagesli liIs there a good RTFtoHTML converter for Delphi or C which can keep as much of its formatting intact as possible, including imagesli ul

Negative 1381 pThe following question is related to passing a variable from routes to the controller. I have a Ruby on Rails v 2.3.3 app with one model, which is delivered to the user with multiple views. The current solution involves using multiple controllers which are triggered by multiple routes. For examplep  precodeActionControllerRoutingRoutes.draw do map  defines map  map.resource simpsons, only gt [] do b   b.resources episodes, controller gt SimpsonsEpisodes end map.resource flintstones, only gt [] do b   b.resources episodes, controller gt FlintstonesEpisodes end codepre  pHowever, for the sake of DRYness I would like these routes to operate with the same controller. In order for the controller to distinct between the routes I would like to pass along a variable via the route. For examplep  precodemap.resource simpsons, only gt [] do b   b.resources episodes, controller gt Episodes, type gt simpsons end map.resource flintstones, only gt [] do b   b.resources episodes, controller gt Episodes, type gt flintstones end codepre  pSo in the controller I could do thisp  precodecasetype when simpsons then ... do something for the Simpsons ... when flintstones then ... do something for the Simpsons ... else      .... do something for all episodes .... end codepre  pI found a way to do this with nonRESTful routing map.withoptions etc., but Id prefer to use RESTful routes with map.resources. One ugly solution might be to parse the request URI in the controller, which Id not prefer.p

Negative 1381 pAt first I thought that hash hack is a requirement, however judging from the recent updates from facebook, I am thinking otherwise.p  pThe original hash hack I am not sure if this is the correct term is that by changing location.hash, one may save a state in the URL without refreshing the page. That is extensively used by Googles apps, and Facebook, and lately NewTwitter. However today I noticed that Facebook no longer have this  if you use a modern browser  like chrome or firefox. I double checked that they are not reloading by using developer tools and firebug respectively.p  pWith a minimal search in stackoverflow, the closest one to the solution is using Flash  however I disabled Flash and facebook.com still works like a charm.  Judging from the coverage in chrome 8 dev and firefox 4 beta, I wonder that could be related to HTML5era APIs, but the code in Facebook is not of my capacity to debug to find out what they did.p  pSince this is like the first question I ask here, I wonder if any of you may have already solved this problem.p  pThanks guys.p  pP.S.

Negative 1381 pI have one form that has several elements and two submit buttons, one is Save the other is Delete. On the Delete button I am using jQuery dialog to confirm user wants to delete.

Negative 1381 pI have the following Clojure code to calculate a number with a certain factorable property. what exactly the code does is secondary.p  precodedefn factor9   []     let [digits take 9 iterate inc  1           nums map fn [x] ,Integer. apply str x permutations digits]       some fn [x] and factor9 x x nums   [n]       or          1 count str n         and divisiblebylength n factor9 quot n 10 codepre  pNow, Im into TCO and realize that Clojure can only provide tailrecursion if explicitly told so using the coderecurcode keyword. So Ive rewritten the code to do that replacing factor9 with recur being the only differencep  precodedefn factor9   []     let [digits take 9 iterate inc  1           nums map fn [x] ,Integer. apply str x permutations digits]       some fn [x] and factor9 x x nums   [n]       or          1 count str n         and divisiblebylength n recur quot n 10 codepre  pTo my knowledge, TCO has a double benefit. The first one is that it does not use the stack as heavily as a non tailrecursive call and thus does not blow it on larger recursions. The second, I think is that consequently its faster since it can be converted to a loop. p  pNow, Ive made a very rough benchmark and have not seen any difference between the two implementations although. Am I wrong in my second assumption or does this have something to do with running on the JVM which does not have automatic TCO and coderecurcode using a trick to achieve itp  pThank you.p

Negative 1381 pWe have a customer who is running a proprietary application, that they want to extract some data from so they can display it on a Web site. The application has an export capability that writes the needed data to a MS Access .MDB file.p  pWe wrote a simple program, using MSs JET drivers, that simply copied the relevant tables to a SqlServer database, where another program would run queries against them to collect what was needed.  This worked fine for a number of years.p  pThen the vendor updated their proprietary application, and while the .MDB files look the same, and display the correct data when viewed in MS Access, what we are getting in our program when we pull records with the JET drivers is corrupt.  It sometimes looks like the field alignments are wrong  a numeric field that should contain 23.40 will contain .23, Im getting dates in the 2150s, etc.p  pMy program, running on my machine, processing the same file works correctly.  The same program, running on the servers where it needs to run, reads corrupt data.p  pI noticed that the version of the JET driver  msjetoledb40.dll  is higher, and the date newer, on my Windows 7 box, than on any of the servers weve tried it on. so I thought it might be a problem with an outofdate driver.  Unfortunately, the latest version of the JET drivers that is available is SP 8.0, which is the version we had installed, and which isnt working.  Later versions are only available with OS installs.p  pSop  pIs there any way of getting and installing more current JET driversp  pAre we being mislead by the version differences in the JET drivers  Is there something else that could be causing the problem, that we should be looking atp  pIs there some other means or tool of extracting data from a MS Access .MDB file  Note  this is a passwordprotected file, so wed need a tool that could handle that.p
Negative 1381 pright now authorization is working perfect in my asp.net web forms application. p  pI was wondering if it were possible to absolutely prevent all unauthenticated and unauthorized users from discovery the admin directory. p  pAs it stands if a user types in the url to the admin directory it takes them to the login page assuring them it exists which is not good, and if successful they will be able to access the admin directory. For security purposes is there a way of preventing them from getting redirected to the login page and maybe just redirect them to the home page, so that they are never really guaranteed that the url they type in is validp

This is correct for a UIViewController, but not for a UITableViewController.p  pThe UITableViewController initWithStyle initializer actually calls loadView and viewDidLoad as part of it initialization process. The property of self.tableView is being set in loadView, but not if you override loadView, which I had done and hence, self.tableView was not being set.p

Negative 1381 pWhat is the proper way to normalize feature vectors for use in a linearkernel SVM  p  pLooking at LIBSVM, it looks like its done by just rescaling each feature to a single standard upperlower range.  However, it doesnt seem like PyML provides a way to scale the data this way.  Instead, there are options to normalize the vectors by their length, shift each feature value by its mean while rescaling by the standard deviation, etc.p  pI am dealing with a case when most features are binary, except a few that are numeric.p

Negative 1381 pI recently came across the subject of exact real arithmetic after reading a hrefhttpwww.dcs.ed.ac.ukhomemheplumeindex.htmlthis papera and a hrefhttpwww.doc.ic.ac.ukteachingdistinguishedprojects2009m.herrmann.pdfthis papera.p  pI have found a number of papers that discuss realizations of exact arithmetic using signed digit streams. The use of infinite streams for arbitrary precision leads to nice practical implementations in functional languages, like Haskell, using lazy lists. However, the papers that discuss such implementations in functional languages seem to come to the conclusion that performance is very poor.p  pNow, I appreciate that exact, nonhardware implementations will generally have relatively poor performance compared to the standard floatingpoint representation, but I am interested in providing a more efficient implementation in an imperative language specifically, C and a collection of operationsfunctions arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exp, log, etc..p  pstrongMy questionsstrong is there something inherently slow about a signed digitlazy stream representation that causes the bad performance, or is it Haskell What is it that makes it slow Would it be possible to implement a signed digit stream representation using lazy streams in C that achieves significantly better performance than its Haskell counterpart, or is this an exercise in futility Perhaps reconstructing as iterationsp  pI know there exists two C libraries, RealLib and iRRAM, that achieve efficient real number computation. However, these seem to use interval arithmetic, representing real numbers as shrinking nested intervals, which doesnt seem as pure an approach as infinite streams please correct me if you disagree. But perhaps these are the only approaches that achieve good efficiencyp  pAny input is appreciatedp
Negative 1381 pI am working on ASP.MVC3 project. I created a base project where I will have all common files  pages like Master Page, Global.asax, Web.Config, Script files, CSS files, and images.

Negative 1381 pIve been doing some research and I cant seem to find the specific answer I am looking for.  p  pThere is an app that is available for Androids that I would like to compile and run on Blackberry.  I have hacked together apps on both platforms, but I have never ported an app from one platform to the other.  I know the APIs are very different and most of these will need to recoded, but since Im a hack, I need a starting point.  So what I am hoping to do is to simply take the Android source and compile for Blackberry.  I know this wont work due to some interface items, but I dont know where to start for those items.  So my question is this  What are the major differences between the Android SDK and the Blackberry SDK with regards to interface designing  Can someone point me to a comparison if there is one or if its quick enough, can someone highlight it for mep  pThe app that i am looking to port is an application written by Google at a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogletvremote relnofollowhttpcode.google.compgoogletvremotea  It is an Android app.  I have reviewed the source and it looks simple enough to try to write a new program from scratch using this code as a base, but I would much rather have a similar looking application to start to customize, rather than building a brand new one.p  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 1381 pI am creating a rails app which will help out businesses. These businesses have thousands of employees who will need a user account on this app.p  pI would like the business to be able to implement a form on their local intranet which can be submitted by users when they want to sign up to my app. This form posts some semisensitive fields to my rails API about their currently logged in user, such as their name and email address which would be populated by their server side code.p  pI can use this information to aid in the process of signing the user up to my site, and in identifying which business they actually do belong to. However, the form information along with an API key will need encrypting to avoid any data being stolen or a business being spoofed.p  pstrongWhat methods of encryption are there out there that can be implemented on a variety of different languages and frameworks, and that involve the least amount of fuss to implement for the businessstrongp  pOPEN SSL with Public and Private key encryption does seem like a good choice, but this does require some exchanging and creating of keys and can get complicated. Are there easier optionsp

Negative 1381 pIm in the process of creating a UI, thats central component is a scrollviewer holding a stackpanel with a variable number of items. If there is not enough space on the screen, buttons on the left and right appear to allow clicking through the stackpanel using the scrollviewer. Note that the items are all of the same size.p  precodeltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt    ltColumnDefinition xNameLeftButton WidthAutogt    ltColumnDefinition xNameContent Widthgt    ltColumnDefinition xNameRightButton WidthAutogt ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt codepre  pThis is working fine. However, Im now required to display only full  complete items. So if there are more items in the stackpanel, than I can display on the screen I dont want to partial items on the right or left appear. I just want my scrollbutton to appear, indicating that there are more items available. So, if a child is added to the stackpanel, the scrollviewer holding the stackpanel should see if there is enough space on the screen to display all items. If not it should reduce its width, so that the next partially visible item is hidden instead.p  pMy question is whats the best way to determine whether all items in the stackpanel can be displayed on the screen. And if not, how can I achieve hiding partial items probably displayed p  pI have played around with the width of the Scrollviewer itself, relying on the strongSizeChangedstrong event, but Im not sure if this is the wisest method to achieve this behavior. Is it better to determine the strongMaxWidthstrong of the scrollviewer on initialisation, set it accordingly and let it growp  pThanks in advance, curiosityp
Negative 1381 pI know the answer is it depends. Im finding with some operations that removing the eagerloading is actually improving performance, both on my LM and on AppHarbor still not yet tested on Azure.p  pIn the cases I have tried so far, the root entity is not being queried by its primary key. The primary key is an int, but these queries go against Guid candidate keys to obfuscate the int pk from URLs. I do not have a key or index on the Guid, the only key other than fks is the int pk, and it is clustered.p  pMight eager loading be faster with a nonclustered index on the Guid candidate keyp

Negative 1381 pIm taking a shot in the dark that someone can guide me with this.  Ive just started working on this and information is not so easy to find.  I have a python code that simulates land use change and can output arcgis raster images.  The watershed model SWAT uses these images to calculate land use parameters generating streamflow quantities.  I have the source code for SWAT, its written in fortran.  Im basically asking how to talk with SWAT using my python code.  SWAT uses txt files to compile the watershed model.  I need to intercept SWATs writting of txt files with my simulated land use rasters...over and over again for each yearly change of land use.  I dont know where to start so any advice on the process would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 1381 pI am using Achartengine for making graphs, and so far it was not so confusing when I made linegraphs with float datas and the achartengine cut the numbers at the decimal point. But if I use PieGraph and count the percentage of all parts and put this number into the graph that indicates the part, it cuts the number at the decimal points again. For example I get three numbers 28,51,20, summing only 99   The LineGraph also accepts only integers, so it cuts the 344.6 to 344.  Is it possible to make float numbers appear on graph using achartengine p

Negative 1381 pI am trying to write a custom report in Spiceworks, which uses SQLite queries.   This report will fetch me hard drive serial numbers that are unfortunately stored in a few different ways depending on what version of Windows and WMI were on the machine.p  pThree common examples which are enough to get to the actual question are as followsp  pstrongActual serial numberstrong  code5VG95AZFcodebr strongHexadecimal string with leading spacesstrong code2020202057202d44585730354341543934383433codebr strongHexadecimal string with leading zeroesstrong code3030303030303030313131343330423137454342codebrp  pThe two hex strings are further complicated in that even after they are converted to ASCII representation, each pair of numbers are actually backwards.  Here is an examplep  pcode3030303030303030313131343330423137454342code evaluates to code00000000111430B17ECBcodep  pHowever, the actual serial number on that hard drive is code1141031BE7BCcode, without leading zeroes and with the bytes swapped around.   According to other questions and answers I have read on this site, this has to do with the endianness of the data.p  pMy temporary query so far looks something like this shortened to only the pertinent sectionp  precodeSELECT  pd.model as HDModel,   CASE      WHEN pd.serial like 30303030 THEN          castX  pd.serial   as TEXT      WHEN pd.serial like 202020 THEN          LTRIMX2020202057202d44585730354341543934383433   ELSE      pd.serial   END  as HDSerial codepre  pThe result of that query is something like thisp  precodeHDModel             HDSerial     Normal Serial       5VG95AZF 202020 test case   W DXW05CAT94843 303030 test case   X3030303030303030313131343330423137454342 codepre  pThis shows that the codeX....code notation style does convert into the correct but backwards result of codeW DXW05CAT94843code when given a fully literal number the 202020 line.  However, I need to find a way to do the same thing to the actual data in the column, codepd.serialcode, and I cant find a way.p  pMy initial thought was that if I could build a string representation of the codeX...code notation, then perhaps codecastcode would evaluate it. But as you can see, that just ends up spitting out codeX3030303030303030313131343330423137454342code instead of the expected code00000000111430B17ECBcode.   This means the concatenation is working correctly, but I cant find a way to evaluate it as hex the same was as in the manual test case.p  pI have been googling all morning to see if there is just some syntax I am missing, but the closest I have come is this concatenation using the codecode operator.p  pstrongEDITstrong  Ultimately I just want to be able to have a simple case statement in my query like thisp  precodeSELECT  pd.model as HDModel,   CASE      WHEN pd.serial like 30303030 THEN          LTRIMXpd.serial      WHEN pd.serial like 202020 THEN          LTRIMXpd.serial   ELSE      pd.serial   END  as HDSerial codepre  pBut because pd.serial gets wrapped in single quotes, it is taken as a literal string instead of taken as the data contained in that column.   My hope wasis that there is just a character or operator I need to specify, like codeXpd.serialcode or something.p  pstrongEND EDITstrong p  pIf I can get past this first hurdle, my next task will be to try and remove the leading zeroes the way LTRIM eats the leading spaces and reverse the bytes, but to be honest, I would be content even if that part isnt possible because it wouldnt be hard to postprocess this report in Excel to do that.p  pIf anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it   It would obviously be much easier if I was using PHP or something else to do this processing, but because I am trying to have it be an embedded report in Spiceworks, I have to do this all in a single SQLite query.p

Negative 1381 pIs there a way to directly access the original key object from a C Dictionary where the key is a reference type Ive seen this question asked on a different site a hrefhttpwww.pcreview.co.ukforumsgetoriginalkeyobjectdictionaryt3351718.html relnofollowhttpwww.pcreview.co.ukforumsgetoriginalkeyobjectdictionaryt3351718.htmla and since most responders didnt understand why this is a reasonable questionnot symptomatic of bad underlying design, I give background detail below.p  pThe workarounds I have so far arep  pa iterate over the keys checking for equality, which is On complexity p  pb maintain an additional intern pool e.g. another Dictionary that maps the keys to themselves. This gets us to O1 complexity but requires extra memory, extra work when items are added to the dictionary, risk of failing to get this coordination right... none of this is fatal but its not ideal and would not be necessary if Dictionarylt offered a method to retrieve the key by key.p  pSpecifically, I have a Dictionarylt State, Listlt State which represents a state graph each key represents a state of a state machine and the associated value is a list of neighbour states directly reachable from there. e.g. the state could represent the configuration of a chess board, and the neighbouring states would be the configurations reachable in a single move.p  pI am populating the state graph by starting from an initial state, constructing the list of neighbours and then recursively calling the population routine for each of those neighbours. At each stage the algorithm checks whether a neighbour state is already a key in the Dictionary otherwise well never finish. State is a reference type i.e. a class with overridden GetHashCode and Equals methods.p  pSemantically, this works fine. But now the lists of neighbours are distinct copies of the states rather than the original copy, so if there are N states with an average of M neighbours each, we have NxM State objects in memory, when we really only want N State objects and NxM references to State objects. Besides blowing up memory footprint it makes equality testing slow because you cant benefit from the referenceequality shortcut in Equals.p  pFrom the comments it seems the problem isnt clear, so here is some pseudocode to illustrate it betterp  precodepublic class StateGraphExample      public static void Main              State initialState  State.GetInitialState         var graph  new DictionaryltState, ListltStategtgt         BuildGraphinitialState, graph           public static void BuildGraphState state, DictionaryltState, ListltStategtgt graph              var neighbours  new ListltStategt          foreach State.Move move in state.GetValidMoves             neighbours.Addstate.ApplyMovemove          graph[state]  neighbours          foreach State neighbour in neighbours             if graph.ContainsKeyneighbour                 BuildGraphneighbour, graph           public class State              Lots of data members here...          public static State GetInitialState           Return State object representing initial state...            public class Move           Representation of a move that takes us from one State to another...            public ListltState.Movegt GetValidMoves           Return valid moves from this State object...            public State ApplyMoveState.Move move           Clones this State object, applies move to it and returns the result...            public override int GetHashCode           Compute hash...            public override bool Equalsobject obj           Test equality...            private State Clone           Clone self...         codepre

Negative 1381 pWe are currently using v1.0.3.3 of Quartz.net on an MVC3 website with SQL Server 2008.p  pThe website is running on IIS7 in which we have set the Idle Timeout property to 0. We have also installed an App Warmup Module. As a safety net we also have  a windows scheduled task set up to download a page every 5 minutes using a powershell script to ensure the site is awake since we were unsure if the app warmup module was working correctly.p  pWe have 13 cron triggers scattered to run at different points of each day.  Some fire once a day, some hourly, some every 1015 minutes all simple.  No trigger uses the same job as another so each job has its own trigger so as far as I can see blocking is not the issue.p  pWe log each time a job starts and ends, as well as any exception that may occur.  When the jobs do run, none are throwing exceptions so we know the jobs arent being triggered and then failing silently.p  pAll the jobs run. It is the frequency that is the issue. yesterday an hourly job 0 0     ran at 2, 5, 6 and 8 in the morning then not run again until 3pm. During this time other unrelated jobs ran so the site is awake and firing triggers.p  pThe quartz section of our web.config is as follows I have removed our connection string nodep  precode  ltquartzgt     ltadd keyquartz.threadPool.type valueQuartz.Simpl.SimpleThreadPool, Quartz gt     ltadd keyquartz.threadPool.threadCount value25 gt     ltadd keyquartz.threadPool.threadPriority valueNormal gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.misfireThreshold value60000 gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.useProperties valuetrue gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.type valueQuartz.Impl.AdoJobStore.JobStoreTX, Quartz gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.driverDelegateType valueQuartz.Impl.AdoJobStore.SqlServerDelegate, Quartz gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.tablePrefix value[qrtz]. gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.dataSource valuedefault gt     ltadd keyquartz.dataSource.default.provider valueSqlServer20 gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.lockHandler.type valueQuartz.Impl.AdoJobStore.UpdateLockRowSemaphore, Quartz gt     ltadd keyquartz.jobStore.acquireTriggersWithinLock valuetrue gt   ltquartzgt codepre  pWe originally had our ThreadPriority set to Low and our ThreadCount set to 5 but have since upped it to Normal, and 25, to no avail.p  pI realise we are using an older version of quartz.net but we do not wish to upgrade since our database and all our jobs have been coded against v1.0 and reimplementing the jobs and db is not an option given our time constraints.p  pI have scoured the interwebs and while there are plenty of questions where cron triggers are not firing, I cant find any remedies to sporadic or intermittent triggersp  pMany thanks for reading this lengthy question and thanks in advance for you help.p

Negative 1381 pIn my current project, I have PostgreSQL as my master DB, and Redis as kind of a slave, e.g., when some user adds another as a friend, first the relationship will be stored in PostgreSQL and then a friend list in Redis will be updated.

Negative 1381 pThe entity framework connects to my database to retrieve columns, datatypes, relations, etc.  It also knows which columns can be null and not null.p  pIf I connect a regular asp.net grid to an entity datasource, it can generate the grid automatically based on the entity.  It knows which fields should be a checkbox based on the datatype, etc.p  pSince data types are built into the entity class, can a regular asp.net control like a grid or formview also perform validation automatically  or generate the necessary validation controls at leastp  pThanks, Kevinp

Negative 1381 pI have a Silverlight page that I would like to have below appearance in portrait and landscape mode.  Essentially, there are three images arranged in a grid.  The big image spans two columns.  When the phone rotates, the images rotate, but the overall layout does not.  The small images remain close to the backwindowssearch button and the large image remains towards the top of the phone.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8h9Pe.png altenter image description herep  pI have tried a number of methods to achieve this effect, but they have  all proved unsatisfactory in one way or another.  Im hoping that someone can point out something that Im missing or, at the very least, prevent someone else from having to waste 4 or 5 days coming to the same conclusion that I did.  strongQuestions in Boldstrongp  ul lipThe first thing I tried was applying a RotateTransform to the LayoutRoot element and rotating it 90 degrees whenever the phone rotation changed to landscape.  I had to hard code the height and width of the layout root to 800 and 400 instead of Auto or it gets drawn squished.  This solution almost worked, but the RotateTransform gets applied after the page is drawn.  Because it is drawn as an 400x800 image on an 800x400 screen, the top 200 and bottom 200 pixels arent drawn.  This becomes obvious after its rotated and the nowleft and right portions are missing.  strongIs there a way to force the layout engine to draw off the screen so that all the pixels are there after the RotateTransform is appliedstrongpli lipThe next thing I considered but did not try was to set the page SupportedOrientations to PortraitOnly and then use the accelerometer to generate my own OnOrientationChanged event and then selectively rotate the images by 90 degrees when the phone is tilted to landscape.  I determined this is a bad idea because I would probably get this wrong in some subtle way resulting in confusion when rotation didnt work quite the same way in my app as in every other app.  strongIs there a way to have the OnOrientationChanged event fire without also automatically updating the layout of the grid that contains my elements  Alternatively, is there some other hook that can be used to detect the phone orientationstrongpli lipThe last thing I tried was similar to the advice offered here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3934811windowsphone7applicationsorientationchangeWindows Phone 7 applications  Orientation Changea and here a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combptorrarchive20100327strategiesfordealingwithorientationchanges.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combptorrarchive20100327strategiesfordealingwithorientationchanges.aspxa.  This solution seems a bit brittle to me because it forces me to change the relative sizes of my grid rows and columns in the OnOrientationChanged event handler as well as in the xaml code.  In the portrait mode, the first row is set to 5 and the 2nd row is set to 2.  Then when I switch to landscape, the rows need to be each set to 1 and the columns need to be set to 5 and 2 respectively.  Alternatively, I could hardcode the size of the small images and set the rows and columns to Auto, but then Im still stuck hard coding something. strongSince Ive exhausted all of my other options, I think this is the solution that Im stuck with.strongpli ul  pAm I missing anything, or is this the way to do itp

Negative 1381 pIve written an app that relies heavily on iSGL3d for 3D rendering, and Ive come to a point now where I need to start fiddling with texture sizes for memory allocation reasons.p  pMy app uses very large textures 1024x1024 and going from that to 512x512 is unacceptablep  pSo, using GL ES 2.0 as a basis, I want to slightly reduce my textures to something closer to 700x700p  pI know this is possible, because Ive painstakingly handwritten OpenGL code in a previous life that uses nonpowerof2 texturesp  pBut Ive had a hell of a time trying to sift through iSGL3ds code to find where I can affect this change... and the project appears to be abandoned now.p  pBasically, by default, even if you use a GLES 2.0 instance, iSGL3d will just make a poweroftwo bitmap and dump your texture into it, leaving a bunch of transparent pixels. This is worthless.p  pForcing the texture size to a nonpoweroftwo image generates GL errors.

My setup fixture would bep  psetupfixture.xmlp  precodeltdatasetgt     lttable nameusersgt         ltcolumngtidltcolumngt         ltcolumngtemailltcolumngt         ltcolumngtpasswordltcolumngt         ltrowgt             ltvaluegt1ltvaluegt             ltvaluegtuser1email.comltvaluegt             ltvaluegtpasswordltvaluegt         ltrowgt     lttablegt ltdatasetgt codepre  pAnd my expected dataset would bep  peditemailexpecteddataset.xmlp  precodeltdatasetgt     lttable nameusersgt         ltcolumngtidltcolumngt         ltcolumngtemailltcolumngt         ltcolumngtpasswordltcolumngt         ltrowgt             ltvaluegt1ltvaluegt             ltvaluegtuser1changedhisemailemail.comltvaluegt             ltvaluegtpasswordltvaluegt         ltrowgt     lttablegt ltdatasetgt codepre  pHowever, if I later added another property called notes to this user object, my setup fixture would now be newsetupfixture.xmlp  precodeltdatasetgt     lttable nameusersgt         ltcolumngtidltcolumngt         ltcolumngtemailltcolumngt         ltcolumngtpasswordltcolumngt         ltcolumngtnotesltcolumngt         ltrowgt             ltvaluegt1ltvaluegt             ltvaluegtuser1email.comltvaluegt             ltvaluegtpasswordltvaluegt             ltvaluegtnotesltvaluegt         ltrowgt     lttablegt ltdatasetgt codepre  pTherefore, I would also have to amend my expected dataset file in the edit email function test to include this new notes property.p  peditemailexpecteddataset.xmlp  precodeltdatasetgt     lttable nameusersgt         ltcolumngtidltcolumngt         ltcolumngtemailltcolumngt         ltcolumngtpasswordltcolumngt         ltcolumngtnotesltcolumngt         ltrowgt             ltvaluegt1ltvaluegt             ltvaluegtuser1changedhisemailemail.comltvaluegt             ltvaluegtpasswordltvaluegt             ltvaluegtnotesltvaluegt         ltrowgt     lttablegt ltdatasetgt codepre  pMy question is, how do I avoid having to edit all my expected datasets everytime I add an extra fieldp

Negative 1381 pIm trying to figure out how the navigation style in Twitter for iPhone has been implemented. p  pWhen you tap a tweet in the timeline, the custom tab bar stays in place during the transition from timeline to detail view. This suggests that the tab bar is a subview of the main codeUIViewControllercode, which contains an array with 4 codeUINavigationControllerscode, one for each tab. When a tab is pressed, the main codeUIViewControllercode removes the currently visible codeUINavigationControllercode from its view and adds the new one as subview. In this approach the tab bar is not part of any navigation stack, thus it stays in place during each transition.p  pHowever, when you tap a URL in the detail view, the tab bar moves offscreen and a new toolbar appears. This contradicts the theory described above. p  pTweetbot uses exactly the opposite navigation style of the official Twitter app. If you tap a tweet in Tweetbots timeline, the tab bar does move offscreen. The tab bar never stays in place during a transition. They probably use one codeUINavigationControllercode, with the main codeUIViewControllercode  tab bar as rootviewcontroller. I assume that the timeline calls code[self.navigationController pushViewController]code on the main codeUIViewControllercode via delegation or something similar when the user taps on a tweet.p  pIn fact, Twitter for iPhone mixes the first theory with the theory behind Tweetbots navigation style. How can I achieve what the official Twitter app doesp

This way there is no halting other calls.p  pId really appreciate any input on this matter as I cant seem to find anything provingdisproving whats happening.p

Negative 1381 pI am programming in VB.net.  I am trying to populate 2 gridview tables by searching an email address against my database.  When the user clicks on the search button i want my program to take the value from a textbox, search the email address against my database and then display the user profile in either, or both my ScrumMaster table and my Developers table.

Currently the code I have isp  precode Protected Sub btnSearchEmailClickByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles btnSearchEmail.Click  End Sub   Protected Sub ScrumMastersDataSourceSelectingByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs Handles ScrumMastersDataSource.Selecting     Dim db As New AgileClassesDataContext      Dim enteredEmail  txtEnteredEmail.Text      Dim scrumMasters  From u In db.Users                       Join ur In db.UserRoles On u.UserId Equals ur.UserId                       Join r In db.Roles On ur.RoleId Equals r.RoleId                       Where r.RoleId  2 And u.Email  enteredEmail                       Select u.Distinct      e.Result  scrumMasters End Sub   Protected Sub DevelopersDataSourceSelectingsender As Object, e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs Handles DevelopersDataSource.Selecting     Dim db As New AgileClassesDataContext      Dim enteredEmail  txtEnteredEmail.Text      Dim developers  From u In db.Users                       Join ur In db.UserRoles On u.UserId Equals ur.UserId                       Join r In db.Roles On ur.RoleId Equals r.RoleId                       Where r.RoleId  3 And u.Email  enteredEmail                       Select u.Distinct      e.Result  developers End Sub codepre  pAs you can see there are 3 methods here.  I want to place the ScrumMastersDataSourceSelecting and DevelopersDataSourceSelecting within btnSearchEmailClick event so that they both run when btnSearchEmail is clicked.  As an email address may be linked to both the developer and scrum master roles, the duplication is not an issue.  Any advice would be welcome.  I hope this question makes sensep

Negative 1381 pI upgraded to Savon v2.0.2 from 1.1.0 and it broke my app.  I made the necessary adjustments to the code to account for the changes in the Error callbacks SavonSOAPFault to SavonSOAPFault, SavonHTTPError to SavonHTTPError, etc and using the call vs the request method.  Im having trouble tracing the error as now I get a strongstack level too deepstrong error.  Ive increased my ulimit s to as much as 40000 and no help.  I dont believe it to be a loop in my code as prior to v2 the code work flawlessly.  None of the examples presented anywhere on the Savon site or as a result of a Google search come close to the XML calls I have to make and have made to the appliance serving the APIs.  Heres what I have for a my client config, XML structs, Builder, and XML Request that has to be made.  Ill also include the code from my working version prior to the upgrade.

LINK3 However it disappears again when you try to interact with it. LINK4 in commentsp  pDoes anybody see any visible error in my JFrame or JPanel construction Do you have any suggestions to help me figure out what is going onp  pSide note The Paint function is called three times when the frame first loads. Once more when JComboBox opens. Once more when JComboBox closes. And finally more times when trying to ineract with the graph by clicking on it. p
Negative 1381 pIve designed a custom container view controller that mimics the functionality of something like path or facebook the sliding deck effect. In order to communicate with those controllers, Ive defined a protocol that allows ask them for some info alert them to some events.p  pNow, ive decided Id like one of these child view controllers to be embedded in a navigation controller. Unfortunately, The navigation controller is now receiving those protocol methods and Im getting a crash.p  pMy temporary solution is to create an intermediary method that asks whether the controller i want to talk to is infact a navigation controller, and if it is, send the message to the root.p  pIs there any more graceful way of doing this It seems like code smell to have to write an in between method that performs this check for every single protocol method in my base controller.

Negative 1381 pIm working on a programming assignment and I was wondering if somebody could help me out with this issue. This assignment says to write a program in Prolog which takes the text from an input text file and write it to an output text file. In order to get the location of the text files, the user needs to be prompted to write the path of the text files.p  pI have figured out how to do it, but I have one small issue that is really annoying. Here is my codep  precodemain     Ask the user for the input text file and then open the file     writePlease enter the filename you would like to read from,     nl,     readX,     openX,read,In,      Ask the user for the output text file and then open the file     writePlease enter the filename you would to write to,     nl,     readY,     openY,write,Out,      Read in characters from the input text file and then put them     on the output text file.     tellOut,     repeat,     getcharIn,T,     writeT,     T  endoffile, ,     closeIn,     told,     closeOut. codepre  pLets say the text file that is going to be read says this is a test. My issue is if I use the program to save this text and write it to another text file, it will write this is a testendoffile instead. p  pI realize that this is happening because the loop isnt being terminated at the right time, but Im not sure how to go about fixing the loop so endoffile doesnt get accidentally written to the text file as well. Any help would be much appreciated. I feel like Ive tried everything. p

Negative 1381 pIm working in a project where Cairo was chosen as the graphics library running on Xlib in an OpenSUSE Linux environment.  I have very little experience working with graphics libraries or graphic file formats, and I was wondering if it is possible to draw a Windows bitmap image to a Cairo surface  It appears to be relatively straightforward to draw a png in Cairo, but Ive been looking around everywhere for information on drawing bitmaps and couldnt really find anything.

I suspect it has something to do with the file format, and that Im parsing and feeding the binary data incorrectly and with improper settings to Cairo.  Can anyone give guidance on how to get this working properly  I apologize for my lack of knowledge and wish to understand this problem better, and any help is greatly appreciated, thanks p

Negative 1381 pI actually want to put up a different toolTip if a control is disabled e.g. to tell the user how to enable it, but the first step is to get MOUSEMOVE events while the control is disabled, as this is how ToolTipManager starts the tool tip process.p  pNow, SkinnableComponent uses .mouseEnabled to turn off mouse events when disabled. Im trying to hack it so it respects the explicit .mouseEnabled, but also eats or declines to dispatch all mouse events when disabled for backwards compatibility.p  pAny ideas commentaryp  pUPDATE Im going to try and use a skin as a wrapper. The skin will be a UIComponent containing a regular TextInput. I will still have to eat the mouse events when disabled for compatibility, but if I override codeaddEventListenercode in the host component not the skin and copy references to any listener for the ToolTipManager, I can give it the MOUSEOVER and MOUSEOUT events.p  pThis allows me to avoid the codeUIComponentthis.enabled  valuecode hack, which was really bothering me.p

Negative 1381 pI have a remote Java web service client based on Axis2 that invokes a web service in OFBiz on another machine. However, My supervisor insists that i use Mule esb to invoke the OFBiz web service as it is the integration platform we are using or our project at hand. OFBiz uses request maps which makes it very hard to invoke its web services using CFX or JAXWS in Mule. I can invoke the web services using Axis2, but Mule does not support Axis2, hence cannot use an Axis2based java client as a Mule component. So my plan is to have a java component in mule that can automatically trigger the Axis2based client to run when the component starts to run in the flow. I tried making the Project with the Axis class part of the Mule project and import all the Axis2 jar files. Then call the Axis2 java client by instantiating it in the Mule Java component. But when i run the mule flow, it complain that it cannot find the logger for Axis2. I know Mule does not support Axis2.p  pSo my question is, How can i trigger the Axis2based Java client by another java class in a different project without creating an instance of that class to make the call All i want is  if my Mule component runs, it should trigger the Axis2based java client to execute too. Thanksp

My final code goes like p  precodeltphp                this variable is the result of the user            selecting word or phrase           coleccion  implodeamp, keysres      contents1  array     contents2  array     contents3  array      words1  array     words2  array     words3  array      switch coleccion       case palabrasamppalabrasamppalabras           contents1  pregsplit[s,], buscar1          foreach contents1 as word              arraypushwords1,  MATCH contenido1 AGAINST word                    contents2  pregsplit[s,], buscar2          foreach contents2 as word              arraypushwords2,  MATCH contenido2 AGAINST word                    contents3  pregsplit[s,], buscar3          foreach contents3 as word              arraypushwords3,  MATCH contenido3 AGAINST word                    searchwords1  implode OR , words1         searchwords2  implode OR , words2         searchwords3  implode OR , words3          consulta                   SELECT                   FROM catalogo                  WHERE                     searchwords1 .                     oper1                     . searchwords2 .                     oper2 .                     searchwords3      break  gt codepre  pThe problem is that when I change the values of the select fields, say someone chooses to do an  OR operation instead of an AND, and chooses to do a phrase search for the second of my text fields, in such cases, I do not see the search being restricted or widened. For example I do a variable dump with the case of codecoleccionpalabrasampfraseamppalabrascode and I do a vardump of the query, then it shows codeSELECT  FROM catalogo WHERE MATCH titulo AGAINST mesones OR MATCH titulo AGAINST y OR MATCH titulo AGAINST bariones OR MATCHtitulo AGAINSTmesones y totems AND MATCH titulo AGAINST barionescodep  pSo my question is what is the correct way of limiting  widening searches in SQL Unfortunately I dont have too many entries on the database to test with.p  pFinally, I also have set things so that queries that try to get all records except some end up with this syntax p  precodeSELECT  FROM catalogo WHERE MATCH titulo AGAINST comunicaciones OR MATCH  titulo AGAINST y OR MATCH titulo AGAINST poder AND NOT MATCHtitulo AGAINSTmesones AND NOT MATCH titulo AGAINST bariones   codepre  pBut I wonder if such a query really excludes the records specified. Or should I use the leading minus in BOOLEAN mode, according to this p  blockquote   pA leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in   any of the rows that are returned.   Note The  operator acts only to exclude rows that are otherwise   matched by other search terms. Thus, a booleanmode search that   contains only terms preceded by  returns an empty result. It does not   return all rows except those containing any of the excluded terms.p blockquote  pI think I now have an example about what Im doubting. Suppose the following queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM catalogo WHERE MATCH titulo AGAINST comunicaciones OR MATCH     titulo AGAINST y OR MATCH titulo AGAINST poder AND MATCH titulo AGAINST mesones OR MATCH titulo AGAINST y OR MATCH titulo AGAINST totems AND NOT MATCHtitulo AGAINSTbariones codepre  pThen I guess that should show all records with the words comunicaciones, y and poder as well as those with the word mesones and y and totems, yet not show those with the ord bariones.  However the result of that query is only those with the word comunicaciones in my DBp

Negative 1381 pI have a large dump 25K of all the private keys from my bitcoin wallet, but I dont have a mapping to the associated addresses for each private key.

I also found these two JavaScript sites that do this a hrefhttpbitaddress.org relnofollowbitaddress.orga and a hrefhttpbrainwallet.org relnofollowbrainwallet.orga.p  pI found the following libraries on CPAN, which sound like they might be helpful to do this, but I have no idea how to plug the pieces together a hrefhttpmetacpan.orgmoduleMath3a3aEllipticCurve3a3aPrime relnofollowMathEllipticCurvePrimea, a hrefhttpmetacpan.orgmoduleCrypt3a3aOpenSSL3a3aEC relnofollowCryptOpenSSLECa. The documentation for the former says its really slow, the latter is probably faster because it uses a C library, but the documentation is confusing.

So on the first line, it spent 0 of its time between 03meters, 59.6 of its time between 100150 meters, etc. With a bit of help from some answers to my last question here on stackoverflow, I calculated the mean  time spent in each depth bin by this animalp  precodediving.means lt colMeansdiving[, 14] lowerIntervalBound lt gsubX, , namesdiving[14] lowInts lt as.numericlowerIntervalBound plotxfactorlowInts, ydiving.means, xlabDepth Bin MetersLower Bound, ylab Time Spent codepre  pwhich provided me with this plotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLV0VG.jpg altenter image description herep  pUnfortunately because my data are means a single value, and not frequencies, I couldnt figure out how to plot them as a histogram... Thats neither here nor there, as I can easily just input these as values and make the desired plot if necessary.. but this does the trick analytically for now.p  pNow Ive got multiple animals and different time bins that Id like to compare. Ill eventually work out a system to weight the time spent in bins to get an average depth to compare statistically, but for now I just want to compare them visually, qualitatively, as well as produce plots that I can use in presentations and eventually publications. What Id like to do is create a density curve representing my histogram, and then plot those curves from multiple scenarios on a single plot to compare. However, I cant seem to make this work  with the codedensitycode function, as I dont have frequency data. I sort of have densities calculated already, as  time spent in each bin.. but theyre not represented in raw format in my dataset as frequencies of categories, which I can then make histograms and density curves out of. p  pThis is how my data lookp  precodegt diving.means           X0           X3          X10          X20          X50         X100         X300         X400           X150         X200   3.330978261  3.299456522  8.857608696 17.646195652 30.261413043 29.356521739  6.445108696  0.664130435    0.135869565  0.001630435  codepre  por p  precodegt dfltdata.framelowInts, diving.means gt df  lowInts diving.means X0         0  3.330978261 X3         3  3.299456522 X10       10  8.857608696 X20       20 17.646195652 X50       50 30.261413043 X100     100 29.356521739 X150     150  6.445108696 X200     200  0.664130435 X300     300  0.135869565 X400     400  0.001630435 codepre  pAnd what I would like to produce is something that looks more or less like this pulled it randomly from a publicationaxes are unrelated to my datap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comseQ6z.png altenter image description herep  pand then be able to isolate the curves and plot them together.p  pThanks for any help you can providep

Negative 1381 pI am working on a project that is supposed to compare the cost of automation vs nonautomated call analyzing and then tell you what year the payback period will be. I am having issues trying to get the formula right to just display the year when the cost of the automated system is less than the cost of the nonautomated system. I have tried using LOOKUP, but cant seem to figure out the logic I guess to get it to display the right year. All formulas must us cell references.

The second row is an example of total spent per year of the automated system, and the third row is the total spent on the nonautomated system. These are cumulative totals. Once the total cost in the second row becomes less then the cost in the third row in the same year, then the cell in the fourth row after Payback Period Year should display the correct year number from the top row. Any help with this would greatly be appreciated.p

Negative 1381 pI have a WPF project set up to use a local SQL Server Compact database through an ADO.NET Entity Data Model in Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop. The project works great, on first run I can load all of the data, manipulate it as I please and come back later with the changed data still in place. p  pI noticed while doing a little restructuring to the schema that the data visible to VS was only the very first bits of data that I entered manually when creating the database and the next time I compiled all of the data I had added since was gonep  pAfter some digging, I came to the conclusion that the compiled version of the app was using the SDF file sent to the binDebug folder by the files ContentCopy If Newer build action. This means that there could be as many as 4 different copies of the database to be worried about project folder, debug folder, release folder, and the deployed copy on the end users PC.p  pI would like to have a single copy of the database on my dev machine that is accessed by both debug and release compiled versions and the database explorer in VS that is installed on the end users PC by ClickOnce. I suppose I could change the connection string to an absolute path during development and hope I can remember to change it back to relative before I publish for deployment.p  pFinally, I foresee the need to release updates for this application as well and am worried that such an update would erase the end users data if improperly done. If possible, I would like to be able to only update the schema of the end users database without touching the data itself whenever I release an update. If this is not possible that is acceptable and Ill just have to make sure I put every structure I can think of into the database before my first deploy.p  pIn summary my questions are the followingp  ol lipHow to share a single sql compact database between VS, debug, and releasepli lipHow to handle local database during application deployment and updates, with the optional ability to update the database schema without erasing the datapli ol

Negative 1381 pI need to save plots from R as EMF format windows metafile format because this makes the chart look good on screen and paper in Microsoft Word. No other option PNG, postscript etc works well on both. The codePNGcode device produces poor res plots. Tinkering with coderescode parameters blows up the graph elements and I cant find anything that clearly explains how to mitigate this. Using codepostscriptcode print output is pretty good. However, Words EPS filters are busted so that I cant see the EPS file on screen. I need something that works well on screen and on paper. codewin.metafilecode is only thing that does both.p  pHeres the twist. I am using codegridExtracode to customise the layout of my plots. From what I gather, this means that I am writing multiple plots onto one device which I then want to export to EMF. But I know that codewin.metafilecode only allows one plot per file.

Negative 1381 pI have to create a program in C, so that I can communicate with a device through serial port. The configuration of the port should be 9600BPS start bit1 data bit8 Parity biteven stop bit1. I am sending you a copy of how I configured the port, but I have a problem, and I can solve it. p  pI send a status request to the device in every 100 to 200 milliseconds, and the device should response back, because of that I have a timer. In the powerup sequence I send commands to the device, and the device is responding back, but after a few sent and received commands, the sending stops, so the receiving also stops, and I notice that the write command and the read command sends back 1, and after that nothing is happening. Why is this occurring p  pIs it because I am trying to read, and I have nothing to read, so at this case I am getting 1, but if this is the case, why I have 1 after write      Thanks in forward for all the help.p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]       timert tid  0         struct itimerspec it          fd  opendevttyUSB1, ORDWR  ONOCTTY  ONDELAY         if fd  1              perroropenport Unable to open devttyS0n             exit1                   satimer.sahandler  signalhandlerTIMER         satimer.saflags  0         satimer.sarestorer  NULL         sigactionSIGALRM, ampsatimer, NULL          it.itvalue.tvsec  0         it.itvalue.tvnsec  10000000         it.itinterval.tvsec  0         it.itinterval.tvnsec  10000000         if timercreateCLOCKREALTIME, NULL, amptid  1             fprintfstderr, error in timercreate n          printftimer ID is 0xlxn, long tid         if timersettimetid, 0, ampit, NULL  1             fprintfstderr, error in settime n          fcntlfd, FSETFL, FNDELAY         fcntlfd, FSETOWN, getpid         fcntlfd, FSETFL, OSYNC           tcgetattrfd, amptermAttr         baudRate  B115200           Not needed          cfsetispeedamptermAttr, B9600         cfsetospeedamptermAttr, B9600         termAttr.ccflag  PARENB         termAttr.ccflag amp PARODD         termAttr.ccflag amp CSTOPB         termAttr.ccflag amp CSIZE         termAttr.ccflag  CS8         termAttr.ccflag  CLOCAL  CREAD         termAttr.clflag amp ICANON  ECHO  ECHOE  ISIG         termAttr.ciflag amp IXON  IXOFF  IXANY         termAttr.coflag amp OPOST         termAttr.ccc[VMIN]  5         termAttr.ccc[VTIME]  5         tcsetattrfd, TCSANOW, amptermAttr         CleanRxBuffer         PowerUp                 ......  void PowerUpvoid     unsigned char pcommands,ima,komanda  STATUSREQUEST     pcommands  ampcomandi[0]     unsigned char ptxbuffer     for               if milisekundi  10  milisekundi  30  milisekundi  50                      milisekundi  70  milisekundi  90                  makeTXpaket0x00                 makeTXpaketkomanda                 ptxbuffer  amptxbuffer[1]                 nbytes  writefd, txbuffer, ptxbuffer                 if nbytes  sizeoftxbuffer                       problem                      printferror writing on serial port                                  sleep0.2                 bytes  readfd, rxbuffer, sizeofrxbuffer                             if bytes  sizeofrxbuffer                                   problem                                  printferror reading on serial portn                                                          printfXn, rxbuffer                                                  ima  CheckRXbuffer                         if answer  0x40 ampamp ima  0x00                              pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0x50 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0x1B ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC0 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC4 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC1 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC2 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC5 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC6 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC7 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0xC3 ampamp ima  0x00                             pcommands                             komanda  pcommands                                                  if answer  0x11 ampamp ima  0x00                             break                                                  if pcommands  0xFF                              break                                                  CleanRxBuffer       codepre

Negative 1381 pFirst of all Id like to apologise for my bad English  Yesterday I finished writing my first multiplayer game Pong in C using Winsock and Allegro5. The game consists of one server for all players and clients.p  pEvery frame FPS  60 clients send their mousey coordinates to the server which passes them to their opponents clients respectively. When I play the game on my 2 computers connecting to the server, which runs on one of them, by local network it works perfectly, opponents paddle is moving smoothly. But when I do the same connecting through my external IP address the opponents paddle is lagging, which ruins the game, because its client which checks if the ball hit opponents paddle or not. Thus synchronisation is ruined, whenever I move one paddle to bounce the ball on the other computer it lags and doesnt make it in time resulting in scoring a point for opponent... But its not the game which is lagging. My paddle and the ball are moving smoothly. The problem is only with opponents paddle.p  pIm new to network programming as Ive only read a hrefhttpbeej.usguidebgnet relnofollowBeejs Guide to Network Programminga. I use TCP sockets to send and recv coordinates of paddles and select function to poll sockets for data.p  pI dont have a single idea what could be the cause.p  pTLDR Opponents paddle lags when I connect through external IP, but it doesnt when I connect through local IP.p

Negative 1381 pI am writing a project in C using Visual Studio 2010 but wanted to use NUnit for unit testing.p  pI am quite new to oop but tried to go as far with information hiding and exposing only the minimum of interfaces required. This means that I have a couple classes which are entirely internal to the library  they can handle some internal state while the user only needs to be aware of a couple of public classes which provide an interface.p  pThis seems to hide as much as possible, providing a minimal interface to the user.p  pHowever, if I want to unit test, I cant see a way to test these classes. So my question is what is best practice Having to expose them purely for the sake of unit testing seems a shame.. or is there a better tool for the jobp  pIt seems a trade off between encapsulating as much as possible and exposing as many methods as possible to allow them all to be tested  surely it would be best for unit testing to test the internal workings and let integration testing test the public interfacep  pp  pI realise that normally, you would only worry about unit testing the public interface, but in this case that would lead to a lot of very convoluted tests  it is surely better to have everything broken down into small chunks to testp

Negative 1381 pI have a main Activity thats happily been working with a Service I created for a while now. Recently Ive had to add a DialogFragment to my app and although its working nicely as well, I now need to make a call to my Service and pass along more than the usual Intent type strings. Basically I need to pass an array of Bitmaps to the Service, and I dont think its reasonable to try and stuff them into an Intent.p  pSo I was hoping, without luck so far, that I could bind to the service while the DialogFragement is open so I can make a direct method call to the Service.p  pIs there any way to do this So I have to copy the entire ServiceConnection class and bind to it from onStart I figured there must be a less messy way to do this.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1381 pI have the following Groovy script which deletes all builds of a given Jenkins job except one build number that user provides i.e. wants to retain.p  precode BEGIN META    name  Bulk Delete Builds except the given build number,   comment  For a given job and a given build number, delete all build except the user provided one.,   parameters  [ jobName, buildNumber ],   core 1.409,   authors  [       name  Arun Sangal    ]  END META     NOTE Uncomment parameters below if not using Scriptler gt 2.0, or if youre just pasting the script in manually.   Logic in this script takes 5000 as the infinite number, decrease  increase this value from your own experience.

For ex If your Jenkins job name is TestJob and you have 15 builds i.e. build 1 to build 15 in Jenkins, and you want to delete all but retain build 13, then this script will delete the builds build 112 and 1415  even if you mark any build as Keep this build forever and only keep build13.p  pbr strongNow, what I want isstrongbrp  ol lipwhat should I change in this script to not delete a build  if a build is marked in Jenkins as Keep this build forever. I tried the script and it deleted that keep forever build too.pli lipLets say, if Im using Build name setter plugin in Jenkins, which can give me build names as what name I want i.e. instead of getting just build as build1 or 2, or 15, I will get build as build 2.75.0.1, 2.75.0.2, 2.75.0.3, ..... , 2.75.0.15 as I would have set the build namedescription as use some variable which contains 2.75.0 as a release version value and suffixed it with the actual Jenkins jobs build number i.e. the last 4th digit  ex set the name as p  precodeENV,varsomepropertyvariable.BUILDNUMBER codepre  pIn this case, Ill start getting Jenkins builds as 2.75.0.1 to 2.75.0.x where x is the last build of that release 2.75.0. Similarly, when Ill change the property release version to next i.e. 2.75.1 or 2.76.0, then the same Jenkins job will start giving me builds as 2.75.1.0, 2.75.1.1, ...., 2.75.1.x or 2.76.0.1, 2.76.0.2, ...., 2.76.0.x and so on. During the release version change, let say, our build will start from 1 again as I mentioned above for 2.75.1 and 2.76.0 release versions.p  pIn this case, if my Jenkins jobs build history shows all builds for 2.75.0.x, 2.75.1.x and 2.76.0.x, then what change should I make in this script to include a 3rd parameterargument. This 3rd argument will take release version value i.e. either 2.75.0 or 2.75.1 or 2.76.0 and then this script should delete build numbers on that release only and should NOT delete other releases builds.pli ol

Negative 1381 pstrongHi Everyone,strongp  pIm working on a little jQuery, and trying my hand at fading out amp in a single element.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve from this is to fade a HTML button element out when it is clicked, replacing the text inside, and then fading the button back in with the new text. But when I add the fadeOut amp fadeIn functions to only the first click handler, it creates a fading outin loop for each time the mouse is clicked. I would only like the first click to fade out amp in the button element.p  pThis code is only for experimenting on amp as I am only just learning about jQuery, it is not that important if i cant find an answer to this problem.

Negative 1381 pOK, so I am doing a course booking system via webpage which connects to a server and a database on ms access.

Negative 1381 pSo I have a tutorials app on the play store. p  pIn the tutorials activity I simply have a single codetextviewcode inside a codescrollviewcode. The codetextviewcode is massive and may contain upwards of 5000 characters. I want to add an option to auto scroll since scrolling so much rubs my fingers raw and I think users may also feel the same since I got a few requests about this feature.p  pOnce again, I want the user to tap the menu button, click the Auto Scroll option and the text should start scrolling smoothly, from wherever its at to the end. p  pI found thisp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16130294scrollviewautoscrollingScrollView autoscrollingap  precodepublic void scrollRightfinal ScrollView h   new CountDownTimer10000, 25        public void onTicklong millisUntilFinished           h.scrollBy1,0            public void onFinish             .start  codepre  pBut I have a few doubts about this. Would this keep the user interface reactive I mean even if it is auto scrolling I want the user to be able to move up or down by flinging all they want emwhileem it is still auto scrolling.p  pFurther this might be a bit jittery on some devices, how do I make the scrolling smoothp  pAbove it runs for ten seconds, but I need it to run indefinitely. Is there a way I can calculate the max time needed to scroll Or simply using a large number will work equally well Say 1 million millisecondsp  pEventually Id let the user set the scroll speed. But I reckon that will be easy once I get the basic auto scrolling right.p
Negative 1381 pIm building a website in PHP and Im trying to implement asynchonous behaviour on some occasions, in this case to load an HTML form into an overlay and making it visible. This works as intended, however Im now testing everything considering existing data. p  pSo I basically created a codevariables.phpcode file that sets values to the codeSESSIONcode global and was working from there. Everything was working as expected on codeindex.phpcode, but as soon as I click the overlay I notice the values arent passing through to populate the form that was added.p  pI already poked google for a few hours to no avail. Ive added codeecho vardumpSESSIONcode on the codeindex.phpcode file and the values are all there. However on the overlay it returns NULL. Ive even codeincludeonceloginForm.phpcode right in the middle of index.php and that gave me the values.

Negative 1381 pIs it bad practice to skip view controllers in a navigation stack p  pIn my example I have a UINavigationController which is being presented modally with three UIViewControllers firstViewController, secondViewController and thirdViewController, most of the time the user will be accessing firstViewController, maybe tapping a row which will then load secondViewController and so on, but what if in some circumstances I want to load the second or third view controllers immediately but still keep the first view controller in the stack, so that the user can still go back to the firstViewController.p  pI can do this but it doesnt feel right  is this something I should avoid doingp

Negative 1381 pIve released several Windows Store apps over the last 2 years. And while theyre moderately successful, theyre all Productivity apps. And a Microsoft employee has confirmed to me that they do not allow generic access to the DocumentsLibrary. What this means in the context that we were speaking in, is that even if I held a Company account with the Windows Store, IWe are still not allowed to gain automatic access to files contained within the Documents Library and we are not allowed to Write datafiles to the Documents Library  unless we also use SkyDrive  but if we use SkyDrive, we must also use the users SkyDrive Folder on the Desktop. And this really screws with how many apps should work.p  pI am finding it increasingly more difficult to release many apps that I have ideas for, due to such silly restrictions placed on us Developers.p  pBased on surveys and research, 92 of our customers do strongnotstrong like storing their data in the Cloud, and nor is it a part of how we want our apps to function. Our apps must function a certain way with and without Cloud storage.p  pNow, lets take a look at an all too common scenario of a normal, safe, Windows Desktop Productivity app. To keep the scenario simple, well be using a Notepadlike program. The only difference being, that it automatically loads all notes into the program on startup. And automatically determines if changes need to be saved, and saves them, if required.p  pIn Windows 8 and 8.1. These apps are dead. We cannot access the Documents Library without a File Picker. What is the user going to do Individually pickselect about 40 files using the Open File Picker So that they can have them at hand in the app and just click it whenever they feel like modifyingviewing it Thats pathetic.p  pSo I began using the AppData folder which theyve told us in Documentation in the past is what thats there for.p  pBut if the user Uninstalls the app, intentionally or unintentionally  their data, is lost. Gone. Unrecoverable.p  pPlease dont think this is a rant. Its not. I am merely explaining the problem in detail in case some dont quite understand my need for such access  or similarsame functionality.p  pSo, my question isp  pSince we cannot use the Documents Library for generic use, where is a strongsafestrong location to store files opened by, created and modified by, the user that is on their hard drive A location that will still make it through App Certification. A location that will remain, even if the app gets uninstalled. A location where we have noquestionsasked access to read andor write tofrom  without the use of silly File Pickers.p

Negative 1381 pIm assuming this is very easy to do, but Ive been searching for a couple hours on Google and StackOverflow with no luck.p  pFor starters, I have a jsp page using Dojo.  I use Dojos request module to make AJAX calls to Spring controllers for all sorts of things.  The controllers call services, the services call DAOs, etc etc.p  pOriginally, I had a properties file that contained several configuration settings for my site.  These were injected into various Spring components using Value.  I wanted to make these dynamically configurable from my admin page, so I added a domain object called SiteSettings that holds the values from my properties file.  When my webapp starts up, if it cant fine a SiteSettings object in persistence, it creates a new one, populates it with the settings from my properties file, and persists it.  If one is already in persistence, it just uses it.p  pAll of the site properties are used on the backend except for one, a boolean called authenticationRequired.  I need to access this value in a javascript value on the frontend.  This would be very easy to obtain via AJAX after the page loads, but I thought its kind of silly to have to make an additional request, when Im sure I should just be able to get the value from my SiteSettingsService which uses the DAO to get the domain object.p  pRight now, Im getting the value directly from the properties filep  precodeltfmtbundle basenameswtcgt      ltfmtmessage keyswtc.authenticationRequired varauthenticationRequiredgt   ltfmtbundlegt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      window.authenticationRequired  ltcout  valueauthenticationRequiredgt ltscriptgt codepre  pHow can I modify this get the value from my servicedaodomain object instead of directly from my properties file  Here are my controller and service files... nothing fancyp  pControllerp  precodeRequestMappingvalue  getSiteSettings, method  RequestMethod.GET     ResponseBody     public ModelMap getSiteSettingsModelMap model          try              SiteSettings siteSettings  siteSettingsService.getSiteSettings             model.addAttributesiteSettings, siteSettings             model.addAttributesuccess, true          catch Exception ex              logger.errorThere was an error getting the site settings data. , ex             model.addAttributeexceptionMessage, ex.getLocalizedMessage             model.addAttributesuccess, false                  return model      codepre  pServicep  precodeOverride     public SiteSettings getSiteSettings         ListltSiteSettingsgt siteSettings  siteSettingsDao.findAll         if siteSettings  null ampamp siteSettings.isEmpty             return siteSettingsDao.findAll.get0                  return null      codepre

Negative 1381 pIm trying to make an open source application that will listen to a socket for incoming data, parse it and visualise this data on multiple fragments. Im programming in Android for only a couple of weeks now so I wanted to get opinions on my approach to the problemp  pSo the application is currently made of  A single activity that dynamically load fragments for UI The main activity receives Messages from a bound service  A single service that creates a socket and a connection on a separated thread This service sends Messages to all bounded client activities when incoming data is receivedp  pMy first question is  What is the cleaner way between using a Bound service or a service running in the background Ive been thinking that as this service will not be used by any other app, it should be Bound so it automatically loads and unloads with the application correctp  pMy second question is What is the best way for a two way communication between a bound service and an activity Im currently using Messages. But Ive seen that I could use a broadcast receiver in the main activity. Is there a way that is more resources consuming than the other one What is the typical clean way of communicating from a service to an activityp  pThanks for your advicesp

Negative 1381 pI have a C program which uses gccs codeuint128tcode which is great, but now my needs have grown beyond it. What are my options for fast arithmetic with 196 or 256 bits The only operation I need is addition and I dont need the carry bit, i.e., I will be working mod 2192 or 2256.p  pSpeed is important, so I dont want to move to a general multiprecision if at all possible. In fact my code does use multiprecision in some places, but this is in the critical loop and will run tens of billions of times. So far the multiprecision needs to run only tens of thousands of times.p  pMaybe this is simple enough to code directly, or maybe I need to find some appropriate library. What is your advice, O great StackOverflowp  pClarification GMP is too slow for my needs. Although I actually use multiprecision in my code its not in the inner loop and runs less than 105 times. The hot loop runs more like 1012 times. When I changed my code increasing a size parameter so that the multiprecision part ran more often vs. the singleprecision, I had a 100fold slowdown mostly due to memory management issues, I think, rather than extra ops. Id like to get that down to a 4fold slowdown or better.p

Negative 1381 pI am currently evaluating how to test a rather big and complex web application, based on Rails 4 on the server side and EmberJS on the client side. In our app, the client exclusively communicates through a restful JSON API with the server. p  pWe did a lot of unit testing based on Konacha so far and are now willing to setup integrationacceptance tests too. We are not sure whether we should start writing endtoend tests, so tests including a running instance of our server, or whether we should go for integration testing the API and the client side separately.p  pOur preferred choice at the moment is endtoend testing, because we fear that in the case of integration testing API and client separately we have twice the effort of creating and maintaining tests and that there might be tiny, little specialities of the comunication between API and client which we could not catch.p  pWell, we like modern amp fast testing frameworks like Konacha, so we dont really want to use Selenium. Not only because it feels a little bit old, but also because its performance is quite poor. Still you will need to control instantiation of mock data on the server and reset of the server, why we came up with the following approachp  pWe implemented a Testing API which conceptually is used to control the state of the server, e.g. it has the following methodsp  precodeGET apitestsetup   Simple bootstrapping of the database, e.g. populate table with ISO language codes etc... GET apitestreset   Reset the database, using databasecleaner gem codepre  pA konacha test case would then call codesetupcode and coderesetcode, before and after each test case respectively.p  pWhat do you think about this approachp

Her house and family traditions support this suggestion. However, I do not see her as a victim of the values of chivalry, formal manners, and tradition. I consider these values to have positive effects of a person rather have negative impacts. If for any reason that had made Emily isolate herself from her community and ultimately kill a man she likes, it would be herself. She acts as her own antagonist in the story because she does not have conflict with anyone else except herself. She makes herself become a victim, as in being friendless and miserable. The traditions and manners taught to her may have effects on her behavior but it is her attitude towards the outside world that separates her from the rest of the townspeople np  pwith the n at the end. some of the characters i get the correct huffman codes, but some others i dont. Ascii 83S, 120x, 84T are some of the characters with the wrong codes. Thanksp

Negative 1381 pIve noticed that the workbook creation statement for xlsx files with Apache POI v3.10 e.g. p  precodeWorkbook wb  WorkbookFactory.createinputStream  codepre  porp  precodeWorkbook wb  new XSSFWorkbookinputStream codepre  p...is taking a long time 30 seconds and the file only has 72 rows with 10 columns 365KB.p  pIts not a problem, but it just seems a bit excessive. Im wondering if Im doing anything wrong or not doing something I should be doing. Instantiation of an xls file with the same data but only 25KB only takes 1 or 2 seconds. If this is normal, then could someone just let me know.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis is the workbook creation code Im usingp  precodeLOG.infoLoading Excel Workbook... Workbook workbook try      workbook  WorkbookFactory.createdataStream  catch InvalidFormatException e      throw new IOExceptionInvalid file format gt   e.getMessage  LOG.infoWorkbook loaded. codepre  pJust to be clear, codedataStreamcode is an codeInputStreamcode. The 30 second delay occurs between the first and second log statements. As I said previously, Ive tried replacing the factory with codenew XSSFWorkbookdataStreamcode but the delay remains.p  pstrongEdit2strongp  pI ran a standalone test which does nothing except the workbook initialization using 1 a codeFilecode, and also 2 an codeInputStreamcode where the source is the xlsx file Ive been having trouble with. They both completed in 2 seconds. p  pI should have added some background earlier. Im using the Google App Engine. The input stream that Im giving to POI is retrieved from a file upload to the server. App Engine doesnt support Servlet 3.0 for handling file uploads so I have to use Apache Commons FileUpload lib to retrieve the file data. Ultimately, the data I get is an codeInputStreamcode retrieved from a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgpropercommonsfileuploadapidocsorgapachecommonsfileuploadFileItemStream.htmlopenStream2829 relnofollowFileItemStreamopenStreama. This is what I supply to POI.p  pSo, I dont know if this is a problem with the App Engine, or if POI doesnt like the flavor of the InputStream that codeFileItemStreamcode is returning. Incidentally, I cannot try the initialization with a codeFilecode instead of a codeInputStreamcode because App Engine doesnt allow writes to the file system.p

Negative 1381 pI have been developing a research code using CMake to generate the Makefiles for a c code on an Ubuntu machine.  I link in several shared libraries which are rather involved to setup and build on a machine one in particular has a dozen or so version specific dependencies which themselves are non trivial to build.  Some are also custom builds of the library bug fixes.p  pI am more familiar with the windows environment with the CLR, but, what I am hoping to achieve is building the binary and including all of the shared libraries along with it.  Hopefully the linker on the other environment redhat EL6 would then be able to use those shared objects at runtime.p  pSince the linker doesnt look in the applications path, I assume I would also need to bring the shared libraries into a user specific library path for it to find.  p  pIs there a nice way using Cmake perhaps Cpack, to build the binary and package all of the shared objects with it for the other machine  Then I could even if manually install the shared libraries for my user only, and run the binary there.p  pIm hoping the answer is not using static libraries, as that has given me a lot of trouble for these dependencies in the past.p  pIm a linux noob, so if my issues is in lack of understanding a better approach I am all ears p

Negative 1381 pHow does one use Firebase to do basic autocompletiontext previewp  pFor example, imagine a blog backed by Firebase where the blogger can tag posts with tags. As the blogger is tagging a new post, it would be helpful if they could see all currentlyexisting tags that matched the first few keystrokes theyve entered. So if blog, black,  blazing saddles, and bulldogs were tags, if the user types bl they get the first three but not bulldogs. p  pMy initial thought was that we could set the tag with the priority of the tag, and use startAt, such that our query would look something likep  precodefb.childtags.startAtbl.limit5.oncevalue, functionsnap    console.logsnap.val   codepre  pBut this would also return bulldog as one of the results not the end of the world, but not the best either. Using startAtbl.endAtbl returns no results. Is there another way to accomplish thisp  pI know that one option is that this is something we could use a search server, like ElasticSearch, for  see a hrefhttpswww.firebase.comblog20140102queriesparttwo.html relnofollowhttpswww.firebase.comblog20140102queriesparttwo.htmla  but Id love to keep as much in Firebase as possible.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pAs Kato suggested, heres a concrete example. We have 20,000 users, with their names stored as suchp  precodeusersuserIdname codepre  pOftentimes, users will be looking up another user by name. As a user is looking up their buddy, wed like a dropdown to populate a list of users whose names start with the letters that the searcher has inputted. So if I typed in Ja I would expect to see Jake Heller, jake gyllenhaal, Jack Donaghy, etc. in the dropdown. p

Negative 1381 pDar All We want to develop a rule engine in Java application to validate dataset because I think there is no rule engine which can be leveraged. We have huge datasets and rule can involve many tables. For example a.age  b.age where a and b are tables datasets and age is filed I explored Java API for script which is very hood framework for developing rules and Java API for rules JSR 94. But both are not very helpful as data is in form of tables. So I think SQL query based rule engine will be efficient and easy to implement. For above rule simple SQL query will do the thingp  pPlease advicep  pRegards Shaileshp

Negative 1381 pIm completely new to using Node.js and even utilizing the command line, so this question may be extremely elementary, but I am unable to find a solution.p  pI am trying to set up an app directory using Node.js and NPM. For some reason, whenever I try to use the port5000 I get a Cannot GET error. My question is, why is my setup for my app directory not workingp  pI have installed connect and servestatic, and yet it will not retrieve files and listen on port 5000.

I do this as a user kstach1. p  pThe only thing I can think of that I may be doing wrong, is where my files are located. I have the angularjs folder located in the root user folder on my Mac kstach1, as well as the server.js file. Is this incorrect If this is not the issue, is it because of where Node is installed usrlocalbinnode My research to this point has led me to think that my problem could also be that I need to add the installation directory to my path. However, I dont want to mess with this unless I know that is the case.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1381 pI know how to specify cultures, date formats, time zones, etc...  p  pMy question here is when you just type DateTime.Now or DateTime.UtcNow in C, is it using the culture from the web server your serverside code runs on, or is it using the clientside langculture of the web browser making the requestp  pTo my great surprise, from my testing, it looks like this server code DateTime.Now is not using the web servers culture.  But is actually using the client LangCult inside the web browserp  pIs there anyway in the web.config to specify DateTime.NowUtcNow to run in my web servers culture by default  I only want client cultures to be applied when I write code specifically for them.p
Negative 1381 p[Note Im only asking this question in order to post the answer, because I found the answer before I finished asking, and I thought someone else might want to know. My answer is purposefully an answer, and is not part of the question.]p  pHow do I use Tkinters codemyWidget.placecode method to get the widget fully visible in the exact lowerright corner of the screen Ive tried using codeanchorSEcode, but the widget disappears although its there its just off the screen somewhere. The following code works well for the upperright cornerp  precodeself.entry.placerelx1, x0, y1, anchorNE codepre  pBut, changing the anchor to codeSEcode doesnt do what I expected.p  pI dont want to use codepackcode or codegridcode with this.p  pAnyway, I want this to go on top of another widget that is already there without being packed into it because that gives me issues, and I need a new widget for every tab that way, whereas this way I would only need one widget.p

Negative 1381 pI have a .NET ClickOnce application. Sometimes the installation of a new version fails and user cannot launch the application any more. p  pWhen the failing app is uninstalled on a local computer and installed anew, then everything is ok.p  pWhen I rollback to the previous version from Windows control panel it is also working, but after the rollback I am unable to retry the installation of the failed update. It means, that after a rollback the newer version that is actually published on server is ignored by the client even if I try to update it explicitly by the code. The code I use is similar to this example a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms404263.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms404263.aspxa.p  pIs there any way how to retry the installation of a previously rolled back updatep  hr  pI have tested it now with another application that is also deployed with ClickOnce to IIS server directly from Visual Studio. The behavior was little different. When I rolled the app back then after launching it, it did offer an update once but after refusing the update then it is not offered during startup any longer.p  pSo it seems to me now that perhaps launching the app from the installation URL and not from the shortcut might do the trick. But to be sure I will wait until the update fails again.p

Negative 1381 pI have constructed a set of python scripts that move files around and tag them with iTunes compatible metadata once they are downloaded. The scripts are set to trigger off of sorting via SickBeard and so they are called from a python program operating as a service. The final stage of the program is to insert the new files into iTunes, but to avoid disrupting SickBeards automated tracking and PLEX, for smarter clients than our AppleTVs I cant simply use iTunes Add Automatically folder. To accomplish my goals I use the iTunes COM interface to add the files directly into the main Library  since I input metadata via AtomicParsley ahead of time its as simple as adding a single new file to the library.p  pEverything works except for the COM interface. I can test it and have perfected about 5 different ways to accomplish my goal in IDLE, but when I call the script from within my functionality triggered by SickBeard I get a variety of errors. p  pIf I simply make a call to the COM interface via the python scripts, the error returned is essentially that win32com couldnt find the COM server itunes.Application. I have tried making the service start under my user account rather than the default SYSTEM account, but it made no difference. I have also tried a number of options to start as a different userp  ol lirunas default  this fails because I cant preseed the account password for storedcredli lilsrunas, runas same programmer  this let me input the password, but have bugs handling input arguments with spaces. I worked around those and these work from IDLE but seem to fail silently when run from the service. Looking at the return results from SickBeard shows no obvious errors but the files are not inserted into the library.li liPsExec  I couldnt get this one to work quite right.li ol  pQuestionsp  ol liShould the COM servers I am able to communicate with be limited by which user is running a service, and why would a service and a command line both running on different users have different resultsli liAm I doing something just incredibly dumb here li liIs there a way to watch SickBeards script execution to see why it might be failingli ol

From the django docs I cant glean any suggestions on how to interact with this cache.p  pI can force the tests that generate the test model to execute last in the particular test file by alphabetical naming, and I know that at least for now there are no other tests in the application that will fail because of this, but as a solution this feels extremely nasty.p  pIs there a proper way to test abstract models without creating test models in application code, while not breaking other tests due to stale backwards relationsp

Let me explain the behavior via simple example.p  pstrong1.strong strongFirst static librarystrongp  pAt the very bottom of hierarchy, I have a static library  lets name it strongFirstLIBstrong. This library includes two pairs of headersource files. The strongsample.hstrong header file contains strongMyClassstrong class definition. Corresponding strongsample.cppstrong file contains implementation of this class its methods. The code is presented belowp  pemsample.hemp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeifndef sampleh define  sampleh  namespace SampleNamespace      class MyClass              int counter      public         MyClass         int GetCounter         void SetCounterint value        endif codepre  pand emsample.cppemp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include sample.h  namespace SampleNamespace      MyClassMyClass counter0              stdcout ltlt Inside of MyClass constructor ltlt stdendl           int MyClassGetCounter  return counter      void MyClassSetCounterint value  counter  value   codepre  pOnwards, the strongdvcl.hstrong file declares simple API used to manipulate MyClass object and strongdvcl.cppstrong implements this API. Its important to notice that dvcl.cpp file contains definition of MyClass object that is used by the methods of this API. The variable is defines as static so it will be visible only inside of this source file.p  pstrongdvcl.hstrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeifndef dvclh define dvclh  void DVCLInitializeint counter int DVCLGetCounter void DVCLSetCounterint value  endif codepre  pstrongdvcl.cppstrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude dvcl.h include sample.h  static SampleNamespaceMyClass myClass  void DVCLInitializeint counter      myClass.SetCountercounter  int DVCLGetCounter      return myClass.GetCounter  void DVCLSetCounterint value      myClass.SetCountervalue  codepre  pstrong2. Second static librarystrongp  pSecond static library  lets name it strongSecondLIBstrong  is even simpler than the first one. It only contains one headersource pair. The strongdvconferenceclient.hstrong header declares one function, while strongdvconferenceclient.cppstrong implements this function. dvconferenceclient.cpp also includes dvcl.h header file which will trigger compilation of dvcl.cpp source. The code can be found belowp  pstrongdvconferenceclient.hstrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeifndef externalfile define externalfile  int DoSomething  endif codepre  pstrongdvconference.cppstrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude dvconferenceclient.h include dvcl.h  int DoSomething      return DVCLGetCounter  codepre  pstrong3. Main executablestrongp  pAnd finally, the main executable strongMainEXEstrong includes only one main.cpp file. This source includes dvconferenceclient.h and dvcl.h headers. The code is presented belowp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include dvconferenceclient.h include dvcl.h  int main      stdcout ltlt DoSomething ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt DVCLGetCounter ltlt stdendl     return 0  codepre  pstrong4. My doubts and questionsstrongp  ul liIf I dont call a function that references myClass object so DoSomething or one of DVCL functions, the MyClass constructor is not invoked. I expected that myClass object will be instantiated by default as dvcl.cpp is compiled. However, it appears that compiler generates needed statements only if it understand that object is actually used in runtime. Is this really trueli liIf particular header file in this case dvcl.h is included in different sources, the corresponding dvcl.cpp is compiled only once. I remember reading something about this, however Im not sure that this is really true. Is it actually correct that C compiler will compile every source file only once, regardless of how many the corresponding header file is included.li limyClass object defined in dvcl.cpp is instantiated only once. If I correctly understand the 2nd point and if dvcl.cpp is compiled only once, then there is nothing to question here.li ul  pI hope more experienced colleagues can clear my doubts and I apologize for very long post.p

And in this case I think there should be only one stream since there is only one file compressed in the file. Structure of the stream is stream header  block  block  ...  block  index  stream footer. And structure of the stream header is header magic bytes  stream flags  crc code.p  pI can find the stream header from my file, but after the first sixteen bytes it doesnt seem to follow the description anymore.p  pFirst six bytes above are clearly the magic bytes. Next two bytes are the stream flags. Stream flags indicate that CRC64 is being used, so the CRC code takes next eight bytes. Seventeenth byte I count from one should then be the first byte of the first block.p  pStructure of a block is block header  compressed data  block padding  check. Structure of block header should be block header size  block flags  compressed size  uncompressed size  list of filter flags  header padding  CRC. So the seventeenth byte should then be block header size 0x16 in my file. Thats possible, but the eighteenth byte seems a bit weird. It should be the block flags bit field. In my file its null  so no flags set. Not even the number of filters, which according to description should be 14.p  pSince bits 6 and 7 of the block flags are also zeros, compressed and uncompressed sizes should not be present in the file and the next bytes should be the list of filter flags. Structure of the list is filter ID  size of properties  filter properties. Nineteenth byte should then be filter ID. This is null in my file which is not any of officially defined filter IDs. If it would be a custom ID it would take nine bytes, but as I understand the encoding of sizes described in section 1.2 of the description it cant be, since according to the description All but the last byte of the multibyte representation have the highest eighth bit set., but in my file the twentieth byte is also null.p  pSo is there something I dont understand or is the file not following the descriptionp

The problem seems to be that ninja does a codecdcode into srcExample and runs codegcode instead of running it inside bldExample where the codeninjacode command is run.  So what should I do differently in order to have a.out in bldExample so that its equivalent to running codeg ....srcExampleHelloWorld.cppcode from bldExamplep  pThanks.p

Negative 1381 pHopefully this is a quick, simple question, but it has got me a bit puzzled...p  pI have a function that takes two compulsory arguments and several keyword arguments that I want to integrate using codescipy.integrate.rombergcode. I know I can pass extra arguments to codescipy.integrate.rombergcode using the codeargscode keyword, where I can specify extra arguments as tuple, but, in the tuple, how wold I specify which function argument is the keyword argument and which are the keyword argumentsp  pe.g. p  precodeimport numpy as np from scipy import integrate  def myfuncx,y,a1,b2     if y gt 1.0          c  1.0ba     else          c  1.0ab     return cx  y  2.5 a  4.0 b  5.0  integral  integrate.rombergmyfunc,1,10,...  What do I specify here so                                                 that romberg knows that                                                  y  2.5, a  4.0, b  5.0 codepre  pAt first I tried defining the function inside a class, so that all the keyword arguments were set in the codeinitcode, but codescipy.integrate.rombergcode didnt seem to like me passing a function with codeselfcode as the first argument. Dont have the error message to hand right now Im afraidp  pAny ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 1381 pI have an app with tutorials. I also have a tab where users can suggest tutorials. Right now, the app loads a table view with an JSON array taken from my website. Every tutorial object in the array looks like this string  Tutorial Name, value1, devices[deviceid1,deviceid2] The string is the name of the tutorial they want to see. The value is how many people have voted for it. The devices is an array of strings where I would save the device ID of each user who votes for that tutorial. This is to make sure they do not vote more than once.p  pNow, what I want the app to do is to change the value key to add one and to add its deviceID to the array.p  pHow do I do that in xcode I am assuming I might have problems with 2 users trying to change the values at the same time.

Negative 1381 pSELECT col1 FROM tbl ORDER BY RAND LIMIT 10p  pThis can work fine for small tables. However, for big table, it will have a serious performance problem as in order to generate the list of random rows, MySQL need to assign random number to each row and then sort them. Even if you want only 10 random rows from a set of 100k rows, MySQL need to sort all the 100k rows and then, extract only 10 of them.p  pMy solution for this problem, is to use RAND in the WHERE clause and not in the ORDER BY clause. First, you need to calculate the fragment of your desired result set rows number from the total rows in your table. Second, use this fragment in the WHERE clause and ask only for RAND numbers that smallest or equal from this fragment.p

Negative 1381 pI am really struggling at implementing threads into my application. This might get kind of long so please bear with me.  My questions are more around the suggested structure of my application than it is around the code to add threading.p  pFirst let me show a visual of my application.  Than explain a few things.  The application is fed data via an Arduino on the serial port.  In a nut shell I open a serial port, read the data line by line, process it and show it visually on the screen.  The visuals are two parts. The first is the time for each racer that is kept and passed via the serial port by the Arduino.  The second it the race progress based on the distance of the race that is represented in the clock style hands you see also see in the screen shot.  This all happens real time and the data coming from the Arduino via the serial port happens very fast. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUAnZc.gif altenter image description herep  pOnce the race is started this function is how I parse the data and tell the system what to do with the data.p  precodedef letsraceself     def getsome         global var1, var2, totalCount         self.reset          self.senddemo         letsRace  1         ser.writegn         while letsRace  1             print mycount             s  ser.readline             s  s.striprn             Check for                        pattern  r[]             if re.searchpattern, s                 print VALID  r  s,                 var1, var2  s.split                 self.options[var1]             else                 print INVALID  r  s,                 pass             if totalCount  4                 letsRace  0         self.racecomplete     thread  threading.Threadtargetgetsome     thread.start   codepre  pAs you can see I do have a thread going.  This worked great since displaying the timer for each racer was bogging down the application.  I have had no problem once I added the threading on the race function.p  pI should also point out that I use a dictionary as a case statement.  It is up in the ini of a Race class. It looks like this below. p  precode    self.options  0 self.drawr1,         1 self.drawr2,         2 self.drawr3,         3 self.drawr4,         0f self.racerFinish,         1f self.racerFinish,         2f self.racerFinish,         3f self.racerFinish,         x self.emptyLine,         t self.raceTime,         G self.letsGo,         CD self.countDown,         C self.emptyLine,          codepre  pBased on what I parse from the realtime data stream I process it with the correct function. Pretty basic stuff so far I think you will agree.  p  pI just completed the code to add in the racer dials on top of the clockstyle display. I am using Pillow PIL to rotate the dials.  This is also pretty basic stuff. I have a canvas and I added four images to the canvas to represent each racer.   I use a different function for each racer to update their position in the race.  They are the first four functions you see in the dictionary above. Here is an example of one of them.  They are all pretty much the same other than what image they are updating on the clock.     p  precode    def drawr4self     if self.r4isdone  0         self.angle  floatvar2  self.movement   1          if self.angle lt 360            self.angle  0         self.canvas.deleteself.canvasobj4         self.newarrow4  ImageTk.PhotoImageself.imager4.rotateself.angle         self.canvasobj4  self.canvas.createimage215, 215, imageself.newarrow4 codepre  pIf you are familiar with PIL and rotating an image you  know that it basically redraws the graphic over and over to show the new positions. Here is where the system now has issues.  On a Win8 or Mac the dials dont really impact the performance of the application.   On a Raspberry PI with limited processing power it does. A demo race takes about 6.4 seconds to complete but on a RPi it take about 15 seconds due to the processing of the image redraws. To get this working on something like the Raspberry Id like to have each dial animation running in its own thread.p  pSo, if you are still reading this great.  I apologize for the length. Now my question.  How would you suggest I get each dial movement into its own thread  Keep in mind that the main racing function above has a thread.  Every threading example I have read is so basic that implementing anything in a full gui application has my head spinning a bit. p

Negative 1381 p2 questions for you regarding Paypal Hosted Checkout solution and the goal of the Identity Token or Token ID.p  p1 Ive come accross several online Paypal docs such as for Payflow integration that talk about providing the Identity Token or Token ID, I think theyre the same do they, but I was wondering whats the goal of passing over this token ID, is it for my own security, or Paypals one, or something else Does anybody know exactly whats the purpose of that token ID, what Paypal is doing with it, andor what the vendor shall be doing with itp  pAsking this because when doing the form post to redirect the user to the Paypal hosted checkout, we have to first call the paypal gateway server to obtain the secure token and this API call is already secured through another method right, I need to pass my account credentials. So why posting only the secure token is not enough and we also need to post that token ID Paypal should already have associated the secure token with my account information through the first API call nop  p2 Also, at the end of the flow, once Paypal returns the customer to my vendor website, does Paypal include any of those tokens token ID or secure token as part of their request perhaps by adding url parameters to my given vendor return url If so, does Paypal recommands any sort of validation to be made on the vendor side, such as validating that the tokens match the ones that I, the vendor, stored in the user session prior to redirecting the customer through a form post to the Paypal hosted checkout Basically, how can I ensure that the session was not hijacked between the time I redirect the customer to Paypal hosted checkout and the time Paypal returns the customer back to my sitep  pReference  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comdocsclassicpayflowintegrationguidehostedcheckoutpages relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comdocsclassicpayflowintegrationguidehostedcheckoutpagesap  pThanks a lotp

Negative 1381 pIm developing a website for someone who requested a dynamic sliding page when you scroll i.e. a hrefhttpwww.balenciaga.comus relnofollowlike thisa.

IE10 however seems to only load the last of the available items but creates titles for all existing web pages. In the network monitor of IE the XHR request is completed and the content is shown but not in the webpage. Oddly, when I uncomment the codealertxhrfilecode everything is shown in IE10. So it seems that there is a timing error but I cannot figure out where. Synchronous request does not solve the problem.p

Negative 1381 pStep 1. I am dragging and dropping some items in a div. Step 2. Item size is auto resizing according to the available space by an auto zoomout functionality. p  pStep 3. Now when I again zoomin, the widthheight  of the parent div should adjust to reflect the scroll effect. For that I am setting the width and height dynamically on click of zoomoutzoomin buttons.p  precode container.csswidth,     container.cssheight,     var maxlist  maxgroupfiltercontainer     var totallist  listcountcontainer1       var boxWidth  container.find.column .outerWidth20     boxWidth  boxWidth  totallist       var boxHeight  container.find.sortableitem.outerHeight20     boxHeight  boxHeight  maxlist       container.csswidth,boxWidth     container.cssheight,boxHeight ifscrollbarnew         updateScrollbarcontainer, new     else          updateScrollbarcontainer, update      codepre  pMy updateScrollbar, is working fine but the problem I am facing is that when I am clicking on the zoom buttons for the first time, the width and height values are adjusted according to the previous zoom values. Its getting updated on the second click of the zoom button. I tried to remove the zoom cache by using .removeData.p  precodecontainer.removeDatadatazoom codepre  pBut this is not effecting the cache clear. p  pStep 4. The Catch I am facing is that when I try to debug the script using Firebug, the values are working fine and thus the scroll works fine. But without debug mode its again a failure. p  pStep 5. I also tried to update the properties using SetTimeout and .done  function but failed. p  precodecontainer.find.column .eachfunctionindex, element         boxeswidth  element.outerWidth  20     .promise.done function           container.csswidth,boxWidth     container.cssheight,boxHeight        codepre  pBut above code also failed. The only reason I have understood by far that jQuery is taking the values for zoom functionality from previous state. I am defining the zoom by using datazoom attribute as below.p  precode.droppedArea[datazoom1] .column     transition all 0.2s ease     width25px     fontsize0.3vw     lineheight0.1em     marginright1px   .droppedArea[datazoom2] .column     transition all 0.2s ease     width35px     fontsize0.4vw     lineheight0.2em  codepre

Negative 1381 pI wondered if anyone can shed some light on this,p  pI have one activity app which has a listview. In onCreate I populate some data in that listview reading it from sqlite database.

It is very simple and plain request and I do not think any code is necessary but if anyone interested I will post some code too.  p  pWhat I want is same behavior as a banking app in exit, when user leave the main screen or click sign out, the App closes altogether.

Negative 1381 pYesterday , I and my roommate discussed a question on the stack. And this questions is here p  pstronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16136943howtogetthesecondcolumnfromcommandoutputwithawkhow to get the second column from command output with awkastrongp  pThey talk about how to separate the second column from the input stream like thisp  precode1540 A B    6 C  119 D codepre  pAnd with the first upvoted answer p  precodeltsomecommandgt  sed s. .1 codepre  pthe result is perfectly satisfied with the request. p  pBut then we find if we follow the greedy rule of regex, the pattern code.code will match code1540 Acode which confused my roommate. With the benefit of hindsight, the pattern code.code should make a compromise with the pattern code.code. Otherwise, the second pattern would match nothing. However, my roommate cant be convinced by my hypothesis. So this guy give me another example to test and we did do it.p  pWe made two experiment. The strong1ststrong add a quote codecode follow the character A like thisp  precode1540 A B    6 C  119 D codepre  pand it is easy to get this result with the previous regex codep  precodeA B C D codepre  pAnd for the strong2ndstrong one , we add a white space and a quote codecode follow the A like thisp  precode1540 A  B    6 C  119 D codepre  pthe result isp  precode B C D codepre  pUntil now, my roommate got more confused, cause his focus always concentrate on the second pattern code.code. And in his mind, the pattern code.code should observer the same behavior between the two string code1540 A Bcode and code1540 A  Bcode , so the second tests result should be codeA  Bcode not rather code Bcode. And I think for the second one , its sure that the pattern code.code cant match this part code1540 Acode which will result in no match for the second pattern. But for the second experiment code1540 A  Bcode , the two choice code1540code and code1540 Acode seem all reasonable , the difference is that the former results from the greed of code.code , the latter thanks to code.codes. p  pSo can anyone give me an answer more specifically to discern which is the key in our confusion.  Thanks .p

Negative 1381 pI am doing some work with MEANjs to help get some experience with it, and Im having issues with Mongooses asynchronous function calls. Im having to build workarounds because Im hell bent on coding in a synchronous mindset. Am I doing all this wrongp  pstrongExample 1 Invoke next action at end of asynchronous callbackstrongp  pFor example, imagine a JavaScript game MEANjs that has serverside combat code. This code will grab any AI enemy entities that have battle commands such as Attack, Shoot Fireball, etc and process those commands. However, the very first thing that needs to take place is looking up the list of available abilities from the MongoDB so that we know what these battle commands need to do. For example, if an enemy wants to execute their Spit Fire IV ability, the returned information would let us know how much damage this causes, etc.p  pThis would require a call to Mongooses model.find which is an asynchronous call. The callback would populate an object with all ability information that can be used later in the battle command processor. This is the troublesome part.p  pOnce model.finds callback has invoked, the data will be stored, and the processCombat function will be executed at the end of this callback. No problem here, right, is this best practice I have in the past just put a setTimeout after calling this type of asynchronous call to ensure that the object is populated, but that seems like a poor design.p  pstrongExample 2 Passing data to asynchronous methods called iterativelystrongp  pImagine now youre in this combat processor method. You have a model.find to get the set of enemies that must be processed, and within that finds callback, you must perform a model.findOne to get that enemys targeted player and execute certain things in its callback such as validating the combat command, changing the players health, updating the enemy to let it know that it has processed its combat command, etc.p  pPseudo code For each enemy that is ready to perform combat, 1 get the enemy, 2 get the player it is targeting in combat, 3 update the player and enemy data to complete combat, i.e. player loses some health.p  precodeEnemy.find... functionerr,enemies      var enemyList  []     forvar i0 i lt enemies.Length i          enemyList.push           playerID enemies[i].combatTargetID,           enemy enemies[i],           processed false                   Player.findOneid enemies[i].combatTargtID, functionerr,player              var enemy  null             forvar j  0 j lt enemyList.length j                  ifplayer.id  enemyList[j].playerID ampamp enemyList[j].processed  false                      enemy  enemyList[j].enemy                     enemyList[j].processed  true                     break                                           do things with enemy and player                codepre  pThe important parts are with enemyList being populated and then its usage within the asynchronous callback. It is very likely, since findOne is asynchronous, that enemyList will be fully populated by the time the first findOne callback executes, but despite that, it wouldnt need to be fully populated for it to validly execute i.e. the target object used in the callback would be available at the time of executing findOne. Once the findOne is executd, it iterates through the list of enemies to find its own playerID that hasnt been currently processed  keep in mind multiple enemies can target the same player, so there is a need for a processed variable in addition to simply looking up the playerID.p  pIs there a better wayp  pA caveat to this What if multiple callbacks are being invoked at the same time. Its possible to create a race condition where multiple instances are on the same line, so using the processed variable wouldnt be 100 perfect..p  pSorry if this is a crazy question, but this type of programming is weird and I feel like Im designing against it rather than with it, so Im looking for insightsp
Negative 1381 pI have created a sample plugin application using RCP framework using Hello RCP framework. Then, I converted the project into Maven project in configure option.

Negative 1381 pIm not used to post questions so please excuse my mistakes.p  pIm looking into moving to GradleNexus for my company and Ive hit a wall. I will try to describe my problem as clearly as possible.p  pI wrote 2 simple java programms, one depends on the other, both depends on junit to run theirs tests. I could compile, test and run them while I was using Maven repository but one of the goals of using Nexus is to have 3rd party libraries on it as well as ours. While using Maven I could upload my builds to Nexus and also use them to compile with through the dependencies so no problem there.p  pBut when I downloaded junit and uploaded it to Nexus I could not compile anymore. Here is the error message I gotp  blockquote   pCould not resolve all dependencies for configuration Project2testCompile.p      pCould not find junit.jar junitjunit4.12.p      pSearched in the following locationsp  precode  httpmycompanynexuscontentrepositoriesTRUNK3rdPartyjunitjunit4.12junit4.12.jar codepre blockquote  pSo gradle looks at the right place but cannot find junit.

Also the first repodepend block is from the build.gradle file of project2 and the second one is from the one of the root folder.

Now I need to find info on codecountcharscode, but a full list would be very convenient for future porblems.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pAfter some research on space and time complexity in general, I found out that this code has ON time complexity and O1 space complexity becausep  pThe codecountcharscode will loop N times full length of the input string, giving it a start complexity of ON . This is generating an array with limited maximum number of fields 26 precisely, the number of different characters, and then it is applying a filter on this array, which means the filter will loop 26 times at most. When pushing the input length towards infinity, this loop is insignificant and it is seen as a constant. Count also applies to this generated constant array, and besides, it is insignificant because the codecountcode function complexity is O1. Hence, the time complexity of the algorithm is ON.p  pIt goes the same with space complexity. When calculating space complexity, we do not count the input, only the objects generated in the process. These objects are the 26elements array and the count variable, and both are treated as constants because their size cannot increase over this point, not matter how big the input is. So we can say that the algorithm has a space complexity of O1.p  pAnyway, that list would be still valuable so we do not have to look inside the php source code. p

If the face A1D1DA is in front of us, then we will see a rectangle the depth cannot be seen with a width of 1 and a height of 2. The problem is  if this face is not parallel to us but slightly rotated so that we can also see part of the face D1C1CD, then the resulting line will have a width  1.p  pThe best way to solve this problem is by drawing a cylinder to make a line. The resulting line will have always a width of 1 regardless of the rotation. But a cylinder is heavy a lot of triangles for the GPU.

Negative 1381 pI use Restlet to implement a web service that processes POST requests, but I have problems with nonASCII character encodings.  p  pI added a filter that looks at the request before it is handled, and coderequest.getEntity.getCharacterSetcode returns codeUTF8code. But at any point, calling codegetTextcode on that entity returns codecode for Korean strings in the input. p  pWhen I start the service locally on my machine, theres no problem this happens only on the server. Although another web service running on that server, also using Restlet, can handle Korean strings properly  the only difference is that it converts an incoming representation into a codeFormcode and then accesses the fields in that form which maybe never calls codegetTextcode.p  pAny ideas how I could find out where exactly the problem isp

And in those debugs it shows that the variable is being set correctly, but the thing is... Nowhere else in the code am I setting the chance variable after that unless the values are getting mixed up in some way, but even then I checked to make sure it was setting the value to the right spawn type.p  pIs there anything I am missing or did I find a bug in luap  pNOTE I invite you to copy and paste the code into a lua command prompt, edit the code and put in print fuctions to debug parts of the code. It should work correctly.p

Negative 1381 pI have a very simple C console .NET 4.5 application in Visual Studio 2015 Community edition. If I go in project properties, and go to settings a can add settings to my application. It adds the designer to my project and I can insert some new application settings which are then in my app.config, that was also added to my project. p  pIn my code I use the ConfigurationManager object as the ConfigurationSettings class is no longer to be used. I added the correct assembly which seems to be an often missed thing, but I got that covered and the program builds.p  pHowever, ConfigurationManager always returns null for any configuration parameter. I found some articles explaining the applicationSettings section in the config file is not correct, and this should be replaced with the much simpler appSettings section.p  pEven though I could change the app.config manually, howwhy is Visual Studio not doing this correct so that I can work on my application and do not have to worry about the layout of automatically generated settings file Is there some setting I have to use in Visual Studio such that these config files are correct in format and function, I can use the project properties and just hit the rundebug button Is this a known issue in Visual Studio p
Negative 1381 pMy website has been experiencing a denial of servicehack attack for the last week.  The attack is hitting our web API with randomly generated invalid API keys in a loop.p  pIm not sure if they are trying to guess a key mathematically impossible as 64bit keys or trying to DOS attack the server.  The attack is distributed, so I cannot ban all of the IP address, as it occurs from hundreds of clients.p  pMy guess is that it is an Android app by the IPs, so someone has some malware in an Android app, and use all the installs to attack my server.p  pServer is TomcatJava, currently the web API just responds 400 to invalid keys, and caches IPs that have made several invalid key attempts, but still needs to do some processing for each bad request.p  pAny suggestions how to stop the attack  Is there any way to identify the Android app making the request from the HTTP headerp

This results in a loop where RDDs are recycled and updated RDDs are readonly, so it actually creates a new RDD.  In principle, one should be able to use  codeRDD.cachecode.p  pThe problem that I have is that it appears that in my loop, strongeven with the code.cachecode the RDD is recomputed at each iteration in the loop.strong  I know the RDD fits in memory because the input file Im using is very small, the RDD only has 8 elements.  My code is belowp  precodefrom pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf import sys  def mymapline     The structure of line is vertex, [list of outgoing edges], currentPageRank     outedges  line[1][0]     currentPageRank  line[1][1]     e  lenoutedges     if e gt 0             returnlist  []             for f in outedges                     returnlist.append f, currentPageRankfloate              return returnlist    conf  SparkConf.setAppNamePageRank sc  SparkContextconfconf fileName  sys.argv[1]   lines is an RDD list where each element of the RDD is a string one   line of the text file. lines  sc.textFilefileName   edgelist is an RDD where each element is the list of integers from a line of the text file.  edgelist is cached because we will refer to it numerous times throughout the computation.  Each element of edgelist is of the form vertex, [out neighbors], so int, list. edgelist  lines.maplambda line intline.split[0], [intx for x in line.split[1]] .cache   vertexset is an RDD that is the list of all vertices. vertexset  edgelist.maplambda row row[0]   N is the number of vertices in the graph. N  vertexset.count   Initialize the PageRank vector.  Each vertex will be keyed with its initial value 1N where N is the number of vertices  Elements of LastPageRank have the form vertex, PageRank, so int, float. LastPageRank  vertexset.maplambda x x, 1.0N .cache   for number in xrange40     LastPageRank  edgelist.joinLastPageRank.flatMapmymap.reduceByKeylambda a, b ab.cache       In version 2, I comment the previous and last line out, and uncomment the following 3 lines.     LList  edgelist.joinLastPageRank.flatMapmymap.reduceByKeylambda a, b ab.collect     print LList     LastPageRank  sc.parallelizeLList  print LastPageRank.collect codepre  pTo give an idea of why I believe the caching is not working, I timed the code above with the number of iterations of the loop being 5, 10, 15, ..., 40.  Then, I changed the code so that at each step I collected the RDD with codeRDD.collectcode, print it to screen, then use codesc.parallelizecode to redistribute the list as an RDD.  When I did this, the computation was significantly faster.  The timing data without the code.collectcode is as followsp  precodeNum Iterations    Times  5                 14.356s 10                 27.783s 15                 47.983s 20                 75.019s 25                108.298s 30                148.345s 35                195.525s 40                248.699s codepre  pBy contrast, when I use the code.collectcode workaround, the 40 iteration version takes only 43.922s.  I would expect then, if the caching were working as I thought it should, that the original version should take at most the 43.9s.p  pAny help is appreciated.  By the way, I appreciate any explanations in lay terms as Im a selftaught programmermathematician by education.               p

Negative 1381 pI am using a form software that has limited editing capabilities, however allows to add java script. Normally I would like to use PHP for something like this, but in this case i will have to use Javascript, which I have very little experience with.p  pEssentially on my landing page, I have a form in which people can submit. First Name Last Name Email etc.p  pthe problem is  I mail merge the submissions, and when people enter their name as BOB SMITH or bob smith and not Bob Smith, it makes it look unprofessional when I send them this email. So I would like to add a javascript to this landing page that when the form submits, it converts the strings in the firstname text field and the lastname text field to have the first letter capitalized, and the rest lower case. Another problem is I do not think I can edit the form properties, so if at all possible this javascript would essentially go at the top of the page, and hopefully I dont have to edit the text field properties to activate it...any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp
