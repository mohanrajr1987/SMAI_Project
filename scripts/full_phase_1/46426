Positive 46426 pI am considering using node.js to build an API like service but am having trouble understanding whether to use a data structure vs. storing information in a databasetext file.p  pBasically the program would allow for a user to come on line and collect that users geocoded location. Then the service would store that information in either a javascript data structure or store it into a database or text file. Then another user would log on and I would connect them with a user who is closes to them.p  pMy question is, if I have a datastructure some sort of custom implemented sorted list based off of geocodes would all of that information be volatile and I would loose it if the program crashed  p  pWould it be more preferable to store the information in a text file or database even though the access and write of that information would take longerp  pAlso, if I was using the data structure approach, would that make it more difficult to scale the application if I needed to expand to additional serversp  pAny thoughtsp

How is the logic works for my case I can understand the logic of public chat use, but couldnt figure out for notification system.p  pIs it like are all these sending notification info data function supposed to be triggered when inserting it to database with unique channel name maybe UID and preset messages for predefined actions eg. UserX started following youp  pBy that, I am planning to use Bootstrap dropdowns and appending the notification data in that dropdown with javascript.p

But for a webbrowser you need much mnore then the WebKit Widget. So it contains a complete GUI Toolkit which is native. It means it uses Cocoa on MacOSX and GTK on UnixLinux and Win32WTL on Windows. But at some level they have to create a common API again. So it has to be like WxWidgets a crossplatform toolkit. The question is if this is useable for development of a different API. p  pPlease answer only if you understand how Chrome is designed.p  pAnd no i dont want to look at QT as it is not pure Cocoa its only using NSView and Appearance Manager and i dont want WxWidgets as this is bloated and you see the design of 1992 together with very late Cocoa patches. p

Negative 46426 pWhat is the best way to maintain a unique ID field across multiple database tablesp  pMy database contains both businesses and people, and both entities need to have a unique ID field associated with it. In addition, there are other tables for example Addresses which can reference either a business or a person using their ID as a foreign key. p  pSome ideas I am thinking of arep  ul lipUse a nonautonumber ID field that gets calculated when a row is inserted. This would solve my problem of being unique, but then anytime I wanted to lookup something by a related property such as by an address Id have to check both tables for which one contains the record Im looking for.pli lipAdd a Prefix to the AutoNumber ID to identify what table to look for the ID in, however then my ID fields in associated tables would probably either become strings or contain flags for what table they are associated with and Im not sure how that will affect performance.pli lipMerge the People and Businesses into a single table. My problem with this is people and businesses have different properties and need separate fields, and this kind of goes against my nature since I prefer to have separate tables for separate entities.pli lipCreate a master table containing a unique ID field, the ID field of either the Person or the Business, and a flag to say which one it is. Then use that ID as my external reference  and in all associated tables.pli lipSome better way of handling this that I am not aware of since I am not a dbapli ul  pWhatever solution I go with needs to be able to easily to handle a large number of records the database this is going to replace has a few million records and is on MS Sql Serverp

Negative 46426 pIm trying to port some Java code of mine that makes heavy use of the System.arraycopy method and want to know if there is an equivalent in C.  Basically I want to have n byte arrays and combine them into one big array.  Each of the initial arrays can be of variable length, so I dont want to go through the hoops of calculating the end arrays length and then populating the entire array one position at a time as this feels rather slow and Im sure this operation has been optimized.  However, I cant find what this optimization is although I may be making this more complicated than it should be.p  pHeres some pseudo Java code to illustrate what I want to do.p  precodebyte[] a  new byte[]0x00, 0x01, 0x02 byte[] b  new byte[][0x03, 0x04, 0x05] byte[] ab  new byte[a.lengthb.length] System.arraycopyab, 0, a, 0, a.length System.arraycopyab, a.length1, b, 0, b.length Now, I would expect ab to look like 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05 codepre  pLike I said, this may be simple in C, but I will be doing this many, many times and want to make sure Im doing it as efficiently as possible.p

Negative 46426 pTime and again I find myself creating a database utility class which has multiple functions which all do almost the same thing but treat the result set slightly differently.p  pFor example, consider a Java class which has many functions which all look like thisp  precodepublic void doSomeDatabaseOperation      Connection con  DriverManager.getConnectionjdbcmydriver, user, pass     try          Statement stmt  con.createStatement         ResultSet rs  stmt.executeQuerySELECT whatever FROM table  query will be different each time         while rs.next               handle result set  differently each time               catch Exception e           handle      finally          con.close       codepre  pNow imagine a class with 20 of these functions.p  pAs you can see, tons of boilerplate opening a connection, tryfinally block, and the only thing that changes would be the query and the way you handle the result set.

I know I could just link it to the category name, but my real scenario is a bit more complex and I would really need to display a second field based on the selection in another p  pMany thanksp

Negative 46426 pIs there a way to progammatically detect when a module  specifically a DLL  has been unloaded from a processp  pI dont have the DLL source, so I cant change its DLL entry point.

From the webapp Invoker, it executes the package but the tasks responsible for calling the executable doesnt execute as the entire package takes only 1 second to complete whereas it should take about a minute.p  pThe executable DOES have a GUI, but it is NOT interactive. This is because when you call the GUI with specific parameters, it automatically runs in batch mode and executes a macro used to generate the desired spreadsheet.p  pI know this is ok because it works on the UAT server AND it works from the command linep  pI have checked the permissions on the executable bu rightclicking the executable and clicking properties.

Negative 46426 pI currently have a concurrent queue implementation that uses a codeBlockingQueuecode as the data store.  I now need to introduce a second type of object that has a higher priority, leading me towards a starvationpriority queue for the original queue.  So were working with objects of type A and type B being produced from multiple threads.  Any objects of type B should be processed before those of type A, but other than that FIFO order MUST be maintained.  So if  1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, 2B  are inserted the order should be 1B, 2B, 1A, 2A, 3Ap  pI tried a single codePriorityBlockingQueuecode to push type Bs to the front, but I couldnt maintain the FIFO requirement theres no natural order between items of the same type.p  pMy next thought is to use two concurrent queues.  Im looking for common gotchas or considerations when coordinating access between the two queues.  Ideally, Id want to do something like thisp  precode   public void addA a            aQueue.adda        public void addB b            bQueue.addb         private void consume             ifbQueue.isEmpty           processbQueue.poll        else ifaQueue.isEmpty           processaQueue.poll     codepre  pWould I need any synchronization or locks if both queues are codeConcurrentLinkedQueuecode or insert more appropriate structure here  Note I have many producers, but only one consumer single threaded codeThreadPoolExecutorcode.p  pEDIT  If a B comes in after the isEmpty check, its ok to process an A and handle it on the next consume call.p

Negative 46426 pI have a Windows desktop application that gathers and stores metadata about a users media library.

This will let me add new features such as displaying their content on the web and social networking aspects.p  pSo Im thinking of creating a web service for users to upload and download their media data.

This is what Im thinkingp  ul liDesktop app asks the user to authenticate with an OpenID or OAuth provider user Anthony chooses to use his Twitter account, using his login name RepWeiner.li liNow that Anthony has been verified to be RepWeiner on Twitter, the data uploaded from the desktop app to the server will be identified to be owned by RepWeiner on Twitter.li liLater, Anthonys hard drive crashes, losing everything in it. He installs the desktop app again in order to download his data from the server.  Again, he logs in using his Twitter account.li liThe desktop app downloads all the data belonging to RepWeiner on Twitter from the server.li ul  pI guess the gist of it is, I want users to identify themselves on the web service, but I also want to avoid making them create yet another login and I want to avoid having to handle the authentication.

So I have been trying to see what is going on in the examples that are using OpenId, and see if I can use parts of that to implement OAuth without OpenId.br   Various approaches includes, on the server side, to read an UnauthorizedTokenRequest and return it via calling the ServiceProvider.Channel.PrepareResponseunauthorizedTokenRequest.AsActionResult, which for some reason tries to add two values of nonce and timestamp to the response which crashes, and skipping that, it still returns a response that I am not able to read on the client end.  p  pSo I guess, my question really isp  ol liIs there a guidedocumentation that tells you what parts of the DotNetOpenAuth library I should be using on the server side, and when in the process they should be used, in order to implement OAuth on a MVC server that is not hardcoded to OpenId, as neither of the websites X nor Y supports OpenIdli liShould I rather use another library if I am not going to use OpenId as DotNetOpenAuth seems to be focusing the most onli liAny other approaches that would fit my need better are very welcome.li ol  pThank you in advancebr  Johny, Denmarkp

Negative 46426 pI apologize for what I realize is likely a very simple question  Im very new to programming and what is likely very simple for the majority of you, Ive been struggling with for quite a while.p  pEssentially, Ive been working on a simple weather app which fetches its information from the Google weather API. The API is set up such that you simply append the town name or zip code to the end of the URL.p  precodequery  toronto,on  CXMLDocument parser  [[[CXMLDocument alloc] initWithContentsOfURL[NSURL URLWithString[NSString stringWithFormathttpwww.google.comigapiweather, query]] options0 errornil] autorelease] codepre  pAs you can see, by changing the value query, I control what town or city the weather is being fetched for. The rest of the app works relatively well  the weather data is displayed and it is reliable for the most part. However, it only displays the weather for whatever city I code into the app, rendering it useless for anyone apart from the residents of my city.p  pMy question is what would be the easiest way to first prompt the user to type in their location, then take that location and have it equal the query string.p  pAs I said, this is likely a very simple question, however being new to programming in general Ive been struggling with it for quite a while. Id be perfectly happy give a few bucks via PayPal to a response which answers my question totally.p  pIf you need any more information to better answer the question please dont hesitate to ask, Im happy to provide it. p  pThanks againp

Negative 46426 pI need to run several independent analyses on the same data set. Specifically, I need to run bunches of 100 glm generalized linear models analyses and was thinking to take advantage of my video card GTX580.p  pAs I have access to Matlab and the Parallel Computing Toolbox and Im not good with C, I decided to give it a try.p  pI understand that a single GLM is not ideal for parallel computing, but as I need to run 100200 in parallel, I thought that using parfor could be a solution.p  pMy problem is that it is not clear to me which approach I should follow. I wrote a gpuArray version of the matlab function glmfit, but using parfor doesnt have any advantage over a standard for loop.p  pHas this anything to do with the matlabpool setting It is not even clear to me how to set this to see the GPU card. By default, it is set to the number of cores in the CPU 4 in my case, if Im not wrong. Am I completely wrong on the approachp  pAny suggestion would be highly appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThanks. Im aware of GPUmat and Jacket, and I could start writing in C without too much effort, but Im testing the GPU computing possibilities for a department where everybody uses Matlab or R. The final goal would be a cluster based on C2050 and the Matlab Distribution Server or at least this was the first project. Reading the ADs from Mathworks I was under the impression that parallel computing was possible even without C skills. It is impossible to ask the researchers in my department to learn C, so Im guessing that GPUmat and Jacket are the better solutions, even if the limitations are quite big and the support to several commonly used routines like glm is nonexistent.p  pHow can they be interfaced with a cluster Do they work with some job distribution systemp

Negative 46426 pLATEST check code at the bottom for my hack solution..p  pORIGINAL Ive followed some tutorials and examples and went and made my own database.  The problem is that when I download the database to the phone its supposed to be read and fill a spinner.. ive found that the downloaded database is intact but when it gets read by the dbhelper it somehow gets rewritten into a blank table.  I cant understand why.p  pEDIT1 Im sorry, I should have been more clear. The database is coming from a server. it is downloaded directly to datadataprojectdatabases . Thats where I checked the file after it was downloaded. It was good until I called DbAdapter mDbHelper  new DbAdaptercontext mDbHelper.opennames after which the Android Metadata table and names table and sqlite table are still in the database, the columns have names, but there are no entries so the table is essentially blank. p  pEDIT2 sorry so lengthyp  pI commented back in the following        p  precodec  initSpinnerc codepre  pits a method I wrote in case the cursor returned  moveToFirst . in this method the database is created and add name is inserted into the table. p  pI then played with the app a little and this is what I foundp  pwhen i first open the app on my device, on a clean install, the spinner shows the default add a name. so i add a name.. I reopen the app and the name i entered is there along with add a name... go to the emulator after clearing all the data and uninstalling.. open the app and only add a name is there.. back out and reopen and the spinner has add a name and the name i entered on my phone... so i add a name on the emulator, go back to my phone and close and reopen the app and there are now 2 names and add a name... p  pSummary It works but I have to reopen the app after the initial install to read the db and populate the spinner correctly.

Negative 46426 pIm a software developer. I love to code, but I hate databases.... Currently Im creating a website on which user will have a functionality to make an entity marked as emlikedem like in fb, emtagem it and emcommentem. And I get stuck on database tables design for handling this functionality. Solution is trivial, if we can do this only for one type of thing eg. photos. But I need to enable this for 5 different things for now, but I also assume, that this number can grow, as the whole service will grow.p  pI found some similar questions here, but none have an satisfying answer. So I asked the problem again.p  pSo, the problem is, how properly, emefficientlyem and emelasticallyem  design the database, to store comments for different emtablesem, emlikesem for different emtablesem and emtagsem for them. Some design pattern as answer will be best p  pDetailed description I have  emtableem codeUsercode with some user data, and 3  more emtablesem codePhotocode with emphotographsem, codeArticlescode with emarticlesem, codePlacescode with emplacesem  I wan to enable to any logged use top  ul lipcomment any of those 3 tablespli lipmark any of them as likedpli liptag any of them with some tagpli lipI also want to count number of likes for every element and number of times that particular tag was usedpli ul  pI approachp  pa For emtagsem, I create emtableem codeTag [TagId, tagName, tagCounter]code, then I create emmanytomanyem relationships emtablesem for codePhotohastagscode, codePlacehastagcode, codeArticlehastagcode.p  pb Analogically for comments.p  pc I create a emtableem codeLikedPhotos [idUser, idPhoto]code, codeLikedArticles[idUser, idArticle]code, codeLikedPlace [idUser, idPlace]code. Number of emlikesem are calculated by emqueriesem which, I assume is bad. And... p  pI really dont like this design for the last part, it smells badly for me p  pII approachp  pI create table codeElementType [idType, TypeName  some table name]code which is populated by administrator me with the names of emtablesem that can be emlikedem, emcommentedem or emtaggedem. Then I create emtablesemp  pa codeLikedElement [idLike, idUser, idElementType, idLikedElement]code and the same for Comments and Tags with the proper columns for each. Now, when I want to make a photo liked a insertp  pcodetypeId  select id from ElementType where TypeName  Photocode codeinsert user id, typeId, photoIdcode and for places codetypeId  select id from ElementType where TypeName  Placecode codeinsert user id, typeId, placeIdcodep  pand so on... I thing that the second approach is better but I also feel that something is missing in this designp  pAt last, I also wonder which is the best place to store counter for how many times the element was liked Only two I can thought about are in element codePhotoArticlePlacecode table or by select count.p  pI hope now the I have explained it better.p

Negative 46426 pIn C03, Boosts Foreach, using a hrefhttpwww.artima.comcppsourceforeach3.html relnofollowthis interesting techniquea, can detect emat runtimeem whether an expression is an lvalue or an rvalue. I found that via this StackOverflow question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3025421rvaluesinc03Rvalues in C03a p  pHeres a a hrefhttpideone.coml9wXE relnofollowdemo of this working at runtimeap  pThis is a more basic question that arose while I was thinking about this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9004831isitpossibletotakeaparameterbyconstreferencewhilebanningconversionsother recent question of minea. An answer to this might help us answer that other question.p  pemNow that Ive spelled out the question, testing rvalueness in C03 at compiletime, Ill talk a little about the things Ive been trying so far.emp  pI want to be able to do this check at emcompiletimeem. Its easy in C11, but Im curious about C03.p  pIm trying to build upon their idea, but would be open to different approaches also. The basic idea of their technique is to put this code into a macrop  precodetrue  rvalueprobe  EXPRESSION codepre  pIt is true on the left of the codecode, and therefore we can be sure that EXPRESSION will never be evaluated. But the interesting thing is that the codecode operator behaves differently depending on whether its parameters are lvalues or rvalues click that link above for details. In particular, it will convert our codervalueprobecode object in one of two ways, depending on whether EXPRESSION is an lvalue or notp  precodestruct rvalueprobe      templatelt class R gt operator       R   throw rvalue      templatelt class L gt operator       L amp  const  throw lvalue      templatelt class L gt operator const L amp  const  throw const lvalue   codepre  pThat works at runtime because the thrown text can be caught and used to analyze whether the EXPRESSION was an lvalue or an rvalue. But I want some way to identify, at compiletime, which conversion is being used.p  pNow, this is potentially useful because it means that, instead of askingp  blockquote   pIs EXPRESSION an rvaluep blockquote  pwe can askp  blockquote   pWhen the compiler is compiling strongtrue  rvalueprobe  EXPRESSIONstrong, which of the two overloaded operators, codeoperator Xcode or codeoperator Xampcode, is selectedp blockquote  p Ordinarily, you could detect which method was called by changing the return types and getting the codesizeofcode it. But we cant do that with these conversion operators, especially when theyre buried inside the codecode. p  pI thought I might be able to use something likep  precodeisreferencelt typeof true  rvalueprobe  EXPRESSION gt  type codepre  pIf the EXPRESSION is an lvalue, then the codeoperatorampcode is selected and I hoped that the whole expression would then be a codeampcode type. But it doesnt seem to work. ref types and nonref types are pretty hard impossible to distinguish, especially now that Im trying to dig inside a codecode expression to see which conversion was selected.p  pHeres the demo code pasted herep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std struct X          X   X x X amp xr  x const X xc        X   foo   return x  const X   fooc  return x        X amp foor   return x  const X amp foorc  return x   struct rvalueprobe          templatelt class R gt operator       R   throw rvalue           templatelt class R gt operator R const   throw const rvalue   doesnt work, dont know why         templatelt class L gt operator       L amp  const  throw lvalue          templatelt class L gt operator const L amp  const  throw const lvalue    typedef int lvalueflag[1] typedef int rvalueflag[2] template lttypename Tgt struct isref      static const int value  0 typedef lvalueflag type  template lttypename Tgt struct isrefltTampgt  static const int value  1 typedef rvalueflag type   int main          try true  rvalueprobe  x        catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y lvalue         try true  rvalueprobe  xc       catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y const lvalue         try true  rvalueprobe  xr       catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y       lvalue         try true  rvalueprobe  foo    catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y rvalue         try true  rvalueprobe  fooc   catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y rvalue         try true  rvalueprobe  foor   catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y lvalue         try true  rvalueprobe  foorc  catch const char  result  cout ltlt result ltlt endl   Y const lvalue   codepre  pI had some other code here at the end, but its just confusing things.

Negative 46426 pI need to process an input file, and copy its content line by ilne to an output file. However, there are some unimportant data stray inside this input file that I need to skip. The main problem that I am trying to solve is actually more complicated than this, but I am just gonna simplify the problemp  pSo, I have an input file containing hundreds of thousands of lines. If the following sequence of 3lines occur inside the input filebr Abr Bbr C  p  pthen I need to skip these 3 lines and proceed with the next line in the input file. I can only skip these 3 lines if these 3 lines occur as a sequence of consecutive lines.p  pFor examplebr Input File  p  pAbr Abr Bbr Cbr Bbr Pbr Abr Bbr Cbr Abr Bbr Abr Abr Bbr Cbr A  p  pOutput filebr Abr Bbr Pbr Abr Bbr Abr A  p  pClarificationbr Abr A skippedbr B skippedbr C skippedbr Bbr Pbr A skippedbr B skippedbr C skippedbr Abr Bbr Abr A skippedbr B skippedbr C skippedbr A  p  pNotice that I can skip the sequence of lines A, B, C only if they occur sequentially. All the other lines which are not skipped have to be copied to the output file. If I use BufferedReader.nextLine, I cannot backtrack to the previous lines if the next line doesnt match the input pattern. For example, if I already encounter an A, and the next line is another A not B, I then have to copy the first A to the output file, and start the filtering again from the second A which I have not processed, and check the next following line, and so on. p  pOne way that I can think of is to firstly save the contents of the input text file, so I can easily backtrack when traversing the input file contents if it doesnt match the pattern I am looking for. However this is not a memorywise solution. Is there any clever algorithm to solve this, preferably in one time traversal, i.e. O N complexity Or if this is not possible, what would be the most optimal solution which is still memorywise Some example C  Java codes will be really helpful. p

Negative 46426 pWe have a CFD solver and while running a simulation, it was found to run extraordinarily slow on some machines but not others. Using Intel VTune, it was found the following line was the problem in Fortranp  precodeRHOV RHOINF1.0wp  COEFFEXPF01.0wpGAMM  1.0wp codepre  pDrilling in with VTune, the problem was traced to the codecall powcode assembly line and when tracing the stack, it showed it was using codeslowpowcode. After some searching, a hrefhttpentropymine.comimageworsenerslowpowthis pagea showed up complaining about the same thing. p  pOn the machine with libc version 2.12, the simulation took 18 seconds. On the machine with libc version 2.14, the simulation took 0 seconds. p  pBased on the information on the aforementioned page, the problem arises when the base to codepowcode is close to 1.0. So we did another simple test where we scaled the base by an arbitrary number before the codepowcode and then divided by the number raised to the exponent after the codepowcode call. This dropped the runtime from 18 seconds to 0 seconds with the libc 2.12 also. p  pHowever, its impractical to put this all over the code where we do codeabcode. How would one go about replacing the codepowcode function in libc For instance, I would like the assembly line codecall powcode generated by the Fortran compiler to call a custom codepowcode function we write that does the scaling, calls the libc codepowcode and then divides by the scaling. How does one create an intermediate layer transparent to the compiler p  pstrongEditstrongp  pTo clarify, were looking for something like pseudocodep  precodedouble powa,b     a  5.0    tmp  powfromlibca,b    return tmppowfromlibc5.0, b  codepre  pIs it possible to load the codepowcode from libc and rename it in our custom function to avoid the naming conflicts If the codecustomPow.ocode file could rename codepowcode from libc, what happens if libc is still needed for other things Would that cause a naming conflict between codepowcode in codecustomPow.ocode and codepowcode in libcp

Negative 46426 pI have a chat server in CLinux using TCP sockets. When using libev I am able to create an evio watcher for read events once for a socket. Something likep  precodeevio newwatcher  eviomallocsizeofevio  initialize the watcher evinitnewwatcher, readcb  set the fd and event to fire on write eviosetnewwatcher, watchergtfd, EVREAD  start watching eviostartloop, newwatcher codepre  pand this works fine because the read event will only fire when there is data to read. However, I have to treat write events differently because they are constantly firing even when I dont have data to write. To solve this problem I have my readcallback create an evio watcher for a write data only when there is data ready to be written, and then the writecallback will delete the watcher after it has sent its message.p  pThis means that I am allocating, initialising, setting, watching, unwatching and deallocating the write watcher each time I need to handle a message. I worry that I may be handling this incorrectly and inefficiently. p  pstrongWhat is the best method for handling writecallback events in libevstrongp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 46426 pIm currently seeking out options for a lightweight dynamic web imaging solution to be tailored for mass customization of virtual product samples. The only tools Ive been able to find that do this are technologo which is really slow and has a weak UI and easypromo3d which is a 3d rendering engine coupled with virtual sampling.p  pThe ideal solution would be able to take both vector eps, ai and raster graphics via user upload and overlay them onto the placement or imprint area of a product image with the correct rotation, skew and blend mode so blending options for different imprint techniques e.g. screen printing, lazer engraving in addition to a tool preferably a GUI of some sort to configure this image placement.p  pThe only option other than those stated above that I have been able to come up is building this from scratch using something like GD or Imagemagick, but thats seemingly beyond the scope of this project. This tool is needed for an ecommerce wordpress site. Any help would be much appreciated.p
Negative 46426 pIf you want to jump directly the the jsFiddle code, its here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbbkxK2httpjsfiddle.netbbkxK2ap  pIdeally, I would expect both object instances to output something else for theMessage.p  pHeres the context We have a massive Ember app, and we want to use a conventionoverconfiguration approach by specifying appropriate default bindings to global singletons in our class definitions if you want to go off on a tangent and argue thats horrible and theres a better way, Im all ears. I dont love our current architecture but it follows the patterns set forth by Ember devs via the example apps.p  pSo we specify default bindings that just work in the running application. And all is well so far. The problem is when we start unit testing. Once we hit about 500 unit tests, we started having problems with test isolation. Some test would update the state of a singleton controller and then other tests would start to fail. It has turned into a huge mess and time sink the last few weeks.p  pTo isolate the tests, we started attempting to override the default bindings specified at the class level, in the test subject instances we were creating in our unit tests. Often, we would try to replace the binding to singleton with a static reference to a mock object. With me so farp  pAfter trying many, many different approaches, the best strategy Ive come up with so far is the codeMyApp.classWithDeferredDefaultBindingscode pattern you can see in the jsFiddle example httpjsfiddle.netbbkxK2. p  pBut... its so much more verbose than the normal Ember way of doing things, and it just doesnt feel right. I guess we could create a mixin or monkeypatch Ember to make it better, but it seemed like a good time to reach out to the devs amp community before we take that step.p  pstrongSo my multithronged question is Is our approach reasonable for overriding default singleton bindings in the context of a unit test Should we be making a feature request to Ember to support this more seamlessly Can you argue its actually a bug in the frameworkstrongp

Negative 46426 pI am developing a Spring Java salesforce app and using Database SDK 22.0.8BETA and OAuth 2.0 to authenticated user login.

I must be missing something simple in Spring or Security config to make 2 users connect to their different orgs and get separate connections. I try many different settings nothing seem to work, ForceServiceConnector always returns the connection for the 1st initial authenticated user to all incoming sessions regardless where they come from or what browser it is or what user it is. So anyone with Salesforce USER ID always get the same 1 user connection instead of their own ORG connection based on their user authentication.p  pAnyone knows this problem or how to configure Spring Security with this SDK to allow user to get their separate connection via OAuthp  pI use this code in Controller to get User informationp  precodeController public class HomeController      Inject     ForceServiceConnector oauthappconnector  RequestMappingvalue, methodRequestMethod.GET public ModelAndView handleRequestHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException, ConnectionException      uid  oauthappconnector.getConnection.getUserInfo.getUserName codepre  p...........p  pHope somebody is doing this or have solved this can point me in right direction.p

Negative 46426 pIve been trying to get a understanding of concurrency, and Ive been trying to work out whats better, one big codeIORefcode lock or many codeTVarcodes. Ive came to the following guidelines, comments will be appreciated, regarding whether these are roughly right or whether Ive missed the point.p  hr  pLets assume our concurrent data structure is a map codemcode, accessed like codem[i]code. Lets also say we have two functions, codefeasycode and codefhardcode. The codefeasycode is quick, codefhardcode takes a long time. Well assume the arguments to codefeasyfhardcode are elements of codemcode. p  p1 If your transactions look roughly like this codem[feasy...]  fhard...code, use an codeIORefcode with codeatomicModifyIORefcode. Laziness will ensure that codemcode is only locked for a short time as its updated with a thunk. Calculating the index effectively locks the structure as something is going to get updated, but we dont know what yet, but once its known what that element is, the thunk over the entire structure moves to a thunk only over that particular element, and then only that particular element is locked. p  p2 If your transactions look roughly like this codem[fhard...]  feasy...code, and the dont conflict too much, use lots of codeTVarcodes. Using an codeIORefcode in this case will effectively make the app single threaded, as you cant calculate two indexes at the same time as there will be an unresolved thunk over the entire structure. codeTVarcodes let you work out two indexes at the same time, however, the negative is that if two concurrent transactions both access the same element, and one of them is a write, one transaction must be scrapped, which wastes time which could have been used elsewhere. If this happens a lot, you may be better with locks that come via blackholing from codeIORefcode, but if it doesnt happen very much, youll get better parallelism with codeTVarcodes.p  pBasically in case 2, with codeIORefcode you may get 100 efficiency no wasted work but only use 1.1 threads, but with codeTVarcode if you have a low number of conflicts you might get 80 efficiency but use 10 threads, so you still end up 7 times faster even with the wasted work.p

Negative 46426 pIm going to be writing my Android app soon, and thinking about buying a solid android device to develop on and play with. My question is for you guys, assuming you wanted to develop and test your app on an Adroid device, what would you recommendp  pSamsung Galaxy looks promising, but I know choosing a good dev phone is one of those things you definitely need to choose wisely on. The Android device landscape seems to be broadening every day, so itd be good to hear about the latest devices for developing. Perhaps I could just get a cheap clunker and it wont make a differencep  pIm sort of a nerd, so if the device is pricey, but has some cool features that others dont, then Id still consider it. However, I dont want to waste too much money on features that I may not need or that may distract me , like HD video, although it looks like a lot of phones have HD support anyways.p  pTablets seem a bit much, but Im still open to it... if youre loving your Android tablet emfor developingem, let me know about it. I could see some benefits like being sure my app will run on Android tablets and different resolutions.p  pAny caveats I should be worried about I have a buddy who was developing Android when it first came out and I remember him complaining that he could never update his device, since the updates were always restricted for some reason. Is that still the case p  pIf you can speak to any of these points, Id be happy to hear them.p  pAlso concerned about using the location based stuff, like gps, will I need a contractp  pIll be developing on my Macbook Air OSX, if you have any additional input as far as devices go, and using a Mac, that would be great too.

Negative 46426 pI just set up SSL on my server. I wanted old requests to the http site to forward to https. The works great in the browser with a rewrite condition and a rewrite rule in Apache2. However, one of our partners has a server that makes requests to a certain URL, and the site doesnt seem to be rewriting those URLs properly.p  pI try to recreate this behavior using curl. When I make the url request with https i.e. curl https......, it works properly and finishes the request as expected. When I make the request the url request with http i.e. curl http......., it returns html text that says this page has bee redirected to https..... . When I do either the http or the https request in the browser, it rewrites properly.p  pUpdate I should say here that this is merely a diagnostic for the observed behavior. As per the comment below, you can set curl to follow redirects, but I dont think the machine that is making requests of which I am trying to accommodate to the server is able to follow redirects in this manner.p  pFurther update If anyone knows where it would be logged that the redirect notification was sent in apache logs, please let me know. Then I would be able to tell what requests werent redirected and be able to tell if the curl diagnostic above is illegitimate. Thanksp  pAny advice appreciated and thank you for all your help. Please let me know if you need any clarification or if there is any Apache configuration or further diagnostics I should provide.p

Negative 46426 pWe have built an Android application which is used to collect data for volleyball stats. This application creates a data file which we ultimately want to be transferred to desktop computers Windows PCs and Macintoshes.p  pWe currently write  the data out as a simple character stream in the default application directory datadataappnamefiles and specify MODEWORLDREADABLE when we create each of these data files.p  pThe problem is that even though the data files are MODEWORLDREADABLE, the various utilities which we would like to use to transfer the data cannot see the data files. I assume that the problem is that they may have read access to the files, but they do not have read access to the directories in which the files are stored. Specifically, I am unable to browse to the files using the ES File Explorer app on the Android device and I am unable to browse to the files when I connect my Android device to the PC or Macintosh as a USB device.p  pIs my only solution to write files to the external directories, or is there something I am missing here about using MODEWORLDREADABLE with application directoriesp

Negative 46426 pIm having troubles finding a bad query thats really causing high CPU load due to MySQL.

Is there a way to do this without altering the code after every mysql query that already exists Since there are a lot of include files its hard to find every query in the script.p  pIm aware that I can log every query to a mysql log, but Im afraid that writing possibly hundreds of queries so fast would overload my server even more.

Negative 46426 pIm trying to make a cucumber test setup with Node.js that can test any website by using an iframe. Normally the iframe is a no go because of cross script security limitations. However if it was possible Im sure it is. And i trust you to come up with a solution to fetch the website being target for the test via the requested url when a specific url name is being requested, so that the iframe would be loaded with a copy of the test target. Basically just a standard node.js server that fetches specific pages based on the req.url Akin to an Address Request Router.p  pHere is my blatant attempt to do exactly that. Fetching the test page via. the url works. But im having a problem switching from the http server to the connection object. Is there a way to feed the connection with the http server responsep  pPS. i also created a solution with two node.js servers. Node 1 fetched the test target and mixing it with cucumber test page. Node 2 hosting the cucumber test. This solution is working. But it creates problems on websites where javascript naming conflicts occur.

Negative 46426 pI really hope someone can help me here  this is my first piece of work in this area and I have hit upon an issue I cannot fix and I starting to pull my hair out looking for an answer. p  h3Overviewh3  pThe plan was to mirror an existing functionional website offline for testing new site designs.p  pOnline the site appears to be hosted on a standard shared host. There is an FTP login and a control panel which gives access to the typical hosting, database and mailbox setup. p  pOffline I am running RHEL 6.2 Scientific Linux with freshly installed Apache, mysql and PHP. I have the site content running as a virtual host on a dummy local domain and have copied the contents of the mysql database locally. p  pVersions  Apache 2.2.15 Scientific Linux PHP 5.3.3 Mysql 5.1.61p  pAt a basic level my offline mirror works. Apache is serving up the HTMLCSS and images. The PHP files for the main content are pulling information out of the database and displaying it in the browser visible website. p  h3The problem...h3  p...is that the backend administration section of the website appears to be in suspended animation  at the login panel stage it just sits there, unresponsive, when credentials are entered. p  pI had been hoping that I could just change the MD5 encrypted password stored in the database and then get the admin section up and running offline. p  pThere is also a very slight visual difference between the online and offline versions of the login page. p  pOnline [a hrefhttpimgur.comJ0yLh relnofollowhttpimgur.comJ0yLha] Offline [a hrefhttpimgur.comsDb6l relnofollowhttpimgur.comsDb6la]p  pThis admin section has been coded in PHP using CodeIgniter as the framework. p  h3Here are my notes so far from attempting to fix this....h3  pstrongModrewrite seems to be required by CodeIgniter.strongp  pI have confirmed this module is loaded by my local Apache the module is listed to load in httpd.conf and I have tested that it is working.p  pThe strange thing is that the method used to test relies on settings in a .htaccess file, while on the live site the .htaccess file is an empty file and I cannot find any other file on the FTP or switch via the admin panel that sets up modrewrite. p  pIf modrewrite is required for CodeIgniter then it is a mystery how it is setup on the online server. It is worth me saying that it is possible that there is a httpd.conf config for this on the server itself as the hosting company and original web design firm have very similiar names so may be one and the same. p  pstrongconfig[urlprotocol]  AUTOstrongp  pI have tried this in each of the settings and none seem to make it work.p  pstrongCode Igniter error logs...strong p  pThese are the result of switching config[logthreshold]  4 within config.php ..adminsystemapplicationconfig.p  precodeERROR  20120827 154141 gt Severity 8192  gt Function setmagicquotesruntime is deprecated varwwwhtmlwebsitehttpdocsadminsystemcodeigniterCodeIgniter.php 46 DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Config Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Hooks Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Router Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Output Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Input Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Global POST and COOKIE data sanitized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt URI Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Language Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Loader Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Helpers loaded url, form, array, auth ERROR  20120827 154141 gt Severity 8192  gt Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated varwwwhtmlwebsitehttpdocsadminsystemdatabaseDB.php 81 DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Database Driver Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Session Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Controller Class Initialized DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Helpers loaded url DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Helpers loaded form DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Config file loaded configbookingssettings.php ERROR  20120827 154141 gt Severity 8192  gt Function ereg is deprecated varwwwhtmlwebsitehttpdocsadminsystemlibrariesConfig.php 177 ERROR  20120827 154141 gt Severity 8192  gt Function ereg is deprecated varwwwhtmlwebsitehttpdocsadminsystemlibrariesConfig.php 177 ERROR  20120827 154141 gt Severity 8192  gt Function ereg is deprecated varwwwhtmlwebsitehttpdocsadminsystemlibrariesConfig.php 177  DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt File loaded varwwwhtmlwebsitehttpdocsadminsystemapplicationviewsloginview.php DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Final output sent to browser DEBUG  20120827 154141 gt Total execution time 0.0278 codepre  pThere were also repeated warnings regarding an incorrect timezone declaration which PHP states it corrects.

Maven will also compile code that is marked with compile errors in Eclipse, when methods from the aspects are used.p  pI tried to enable JDT Weaving via the preferences and also followed the instructions a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgJDTweavingfeaturesTurningonJDTWeavingmanually relnofollowfor manual activation from the eclipse wikiap  pAm I right that the problem I am facing is related to the disabled JDT Weaving feature If yes, how can I enable JDT Weaving or find the reason why it wont be enabledp  pThanks for helpp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I created a new workspace and imported the Spring Roo project as a Maven project. I see dialog coming up, that wants to convert a legacy STS project. When I confirm, it seems that nothing happens. But now at least I can see Advice Markers in the Entities generated by Spring Roo. However I still not able to use any method, that was woven in the class.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Running JUnit Tests is also no problem, even if there are the compile errors. Im using Eclipse Indigo.p

Negative 46426 pI have been reading up on JFileChooser in javax.swing. I know the showOpenDialog method will allow me to select a File and click choose but I have a specific way I want it to work.p  pI want to use two JFileChoosers probably side by side in a JPanel to select a TO and FROM path and then click a button that will take the user input from both Choosers and do something. p  pPerhaps if anyone has an example of just doing a single JFileChooser like this Essentially just highlighting the filedirectory in the chooser and clicking some OTHER button to take the input from the Chooser also the JFileChoosers buttons cancel and choose are hidden. p  pMost likely this other button would just be a signal to the code to get the value from the JFileChooser object.p  pIm hoping being new to Swing that there is another class I am missing that can do what I have described but its just not coming up in Google searches I have been crafting. p

Negative 46426 pIm wondering if there is any mechanism to set an input to a codeViewPartcode.p  pFor example My application has a search functionality. When I hit search i want to show my result in a codeViewPartcode that contains a table. How can I set the input of this table, how can a transmit the results to the ViewPart Im currently using codeorg.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPage.showViewString, String, intcode to show the codeViewPartcode.p  pI am currently using a Util class, called ViewUtil with static methods like showViewString id and showViewWithParameterString id, Object parameter. The second method shows the view, and save the parameter in a Map in the ViewUtil class. The createPartControlComposite method gets the parameter from this map and sets the input to the table. It works but I really dont like it.p  pAnother problem is that when a call the org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPage.showViewString, String, int method, if the ViewPart is already shown, the createPartControlComposite method is not called, thus the input of the table is not set.p  pIm sure there is a better way but I cant find it.p

Negative 46426 pIm doing a project which needs to track location indoors. It needs to track where someone is inside a building and show them where to go.

Negative 46426 pIm curious what sort of difference there is in browser behavior when loading a page by clicking through a link vs. copypasting said link into the browser bar. Is there a general difference in the load process that I should know about p  pI ask because I am working on an application using the Google Maps API, in which the user is able to create custom map links with a GPS location defined in the URL. The links work fine when copypasted into the browser however, if the link is clicked directly, the browser generates a stack exceeded exception appropriate for this site. p  pWhile I understand that generally we like to see code examples on Stack Overflow, Im going to refrain from that for now  perhaps if anyone knows about differences in the  DOM loading process between click and copypaste, I can use that to narrow in on the issue without bogging down the discussion with tangentiallyrelated code. p  pThe same issue occurs in both Firefox and Chrome. p  pthanks p

Negative 46426 pIm trying to understand how the configurations under .sshconfig and .gitconfig interact.p  pHeres the situation I have two separate github accounts, lets call them GH0 and GH1, and I want to interact with both passwordlessly, i.e., using ssh keys in code.sshidrsa.GH0.pubcode and code.sshidrsa.GH1.pubcode.  At the moment this works for GH0 but not for GH1.  E.g., codepushcode commands to GH1 die with codeERROR Repository not found.nfatal The remote end hung unexpectedly.code codessh T gitgithub.comcode works, but only because it connects codeGH0code.p  pThis means that for each of these github accounts I have to have a corresponding section in .sshconfig, specifying which ssh key file to use for it.  E.g., the section for GH0 will have something like codeIdentityFile .sshidrsa.GH0code, etc.p  pThe question is what else do I have to put in each of these sections  More specifically, p  blockquote   pwhat do I have to put as the argument to the codeHostcode keyword in code.sshconfigcodep blockquote  pThe information that Ive found so far on this makes no sense to me.  In some examples, I see stuff likep  precodeHost github.com     Hostname github.com     User git     IdentityFile .sshidrsa  Host ac2.github.com     Hostname github.com     User git     IdentityFile .sshidrsaac2 codepre  pWhere does that ac2. prefix in the second codeHostcode come fromp  blockquote   pWhere do I find the corresponding ones for my github accountsp blockquote  pSome of the info Ive found lead one to guess that arguments to the codeHostcode keyword are in fact arbitrary, implying that the following would be fine toop  precodeHost omgwtfbbq     Hostname github.com     User git     IdentityFile .sshGH0  Host 4.8.15.16.23.42     Hostname github.com     User git     IdentityFile .sshGH1 codepre  pBut if so, this raises yet another question strongemHow does codegitcode or github know which of these two sections to use for any given commandemstrongp  pAgain, I emguessemsup1sup that this would be specified in the projects code.gitconfigcode file, under some code[remote ...]code section, but howp  psup1supsubI must resort to guessing because, for one thing, I have not been able to find documentation for the interpretation of the keyvalue pairs in .gitconfig.

Negative 46426 pI am writing a greasemonkey script and using an external script that creates a preferences window. The preferences window is initialized with the following codep  precodeUSP.init         theName showadvd,         theDefault true     ,          theName showahd,         theDefault true     ,          theName showat,         theDefault true     ,          theName showbithd,         theDefault true     ,          theName showbmtv,         theDefault true      codepre  pThe code is actually about 50 of those blocks instead of just 5, and it is constantly being updated. What I want to do is have an external file of the names that would be read in and made into an array. For test purposes Im just using a test array.p  precodevar test  [test0,test1,test2] codepre  pNow I was planning on using a for loop to make the block so I would have just one instead of 50, but I cant figure out how to not break the formatting thats necessary.p  pIt would look something like thisp  precodeUSP.init forint i0ilttest.lengthi               theName test[i],         theDefault true       codepre  pBut obviously that doesnt work.

Negative 46426 pAs many people know, Python uses the Mersenne Twister MT algorithm to handle its random numbers.  However, despite having a very long period 219937, it is also wellknown that you cant reach every random permutation when you shuffle a sequence greater than 2080 elements since 2081  219937.  As I am dealing with permutations and statistical properties are important to me, Im trying to figure out the best way to mix or reseed the Python generator with an additional source of randomness to avoid repetition.p  pCurrently, my concept is to use the system random number generator SystemRandom to add an external source of randomness to the MT generator.  There are two ways that I can think of to do thisp  ol liXOR the SystemRandom random number with the MT random numberli liUse the SystemRandom to reseed the MTli ol  pThe first approach is used with some frequency by hardware random number generators, to reduce their bias tendencies.  However, its wildly inefficient.  On a Windows XP machine, the SystemRandom is 50 times slower than the standard Python random function.  Thats a huge performance hit when most of your function involves shuffling.  Given that, reseeding the MT with the SystemRandom should be significantly more efficient.  p  pHowever, there are two issues with that approach also.  Firstly, reseeding the MT during operation might disrupt its statistical properties.  Im fairly certain this shouldnt be an issue if the MT runs long enough, as each run of MT values should be wellformed regardless of the starting point.  It does however indicate that a sizable period between MT reseeding is preferred.  Secondly, there is the question of what is the most efficient way to trigger reseeding.  The simplest way to handle this is with a counter.  However, more efficient ways might be possible.p  pSo then, there are three questions on this pointp  ol liHas anyone read anything to the effect that reseeding an MT with a random value after every N samples will alter its desirable statistical propertiesli liDoes anyone know a more efficient way to do so than incrementing a counter to trigger a reseedli liFinally, if anyone knows a generally better way to approach this problem, Im all ears.li ol

Negative 46426 pWe have a caching solution which relies on StructureMap to provide the correct cache implementation to developers. Im trying to reduce the amount of StructureMap configuration needed, but have gotten stuck... The cache providers such as local cache, distributed, ... all implement the interface codeICacheltTgtcode, and types are registered against different cache profiles as per the need for crossserver consistency. A profile is then mapped agains some cache provider. Currently, it is required to specify for each type cached how it should be cached, which gives a lot of lines like these in initializationp  precodeCacheSetup.CacheTypeltFoogt.WithltLocalMemoryCachegt CacheSetup.CacheTypeltBargt.WithltLocalMemoryCachegt CacheSetup.CacheTypeltBazgt.WithltDistributedCachegt codepre  pEach of these lines basically fetches the cache provider for the requested profile and the registers that provider implementation of codeICacheltTgtcode for that type.p  pWhat I want to do, is to be able to set a default cache profile that will be used for types that are not explicitly registered. In the above example, Id like to set codeLocalMemoryCachecode to the default profile, and then when codeGetInstanceltICacheltFoogtgtcode is called, it should be resolved by the cache provider associated with that profile. Ive been reading the documentation extensivly, especially the interception parts, but there doesnt seem to be a way to intercept strongbeforestrong the instance is created, which I would need. p  pAny ideas how this could be accomplished p

Negative 46426 pIn our app, we replace the standard select by a jQuery plugin to be able to style the selects in CSS. I am trying to make it work with Ember but my solution is really dirty. Is there a proper way to do thisp  pI think the key issue is this kind of plugins need the HTML to be rendered in the page to update themselves. Yet, Ember bindings fire before the HTML is actually rendered in the page.p  precodeEmber.Select.reopen     didInsertElement function         this..selectBox  Create the jQuery plugin     ,     valueChanged function         this..selectBoxvalue, this.getvalue  Update the plugin value     .observesvalue,      contentChanged function         this.setvalue, 10  Fake value, just to force the cache. Othwerwise it wont refresh if the previous value was also 0.         this.setvalue, 0  Default value for the new content.            Option 1 manually recreate the plugin using content  it fails with          Uncaught Error Cannot perform operations on a Metamorph that is not in the DOM.          And anyway it means content needs to have a specific format which is not great.         var contentAsJson           this.getcontent.forEachfunctionvalcontentAsJson[val.getid]  val.getdisplayName         this..selectBoxdestroy         this..selectBox         this..selectBoxoptions, contentAsJson         this..selectBoxvalue, this.getvalue           Options 2 wait for the actual HTML to be rendered with a timer. It works but it is terrible I guess          to rely on a timer.          var self  this.         setTimeoutfunctionself.selectBoxrefresh, 100      .observescontent   codepre
Negative 46426 pIve got a C function behind a clambda which needs to do some grubbing around with a select2 call and decide on a scheme symbol to return as an indication of what it did, and whether an error condition occurred.

Negative 46426 pI am building an offline web application, and I want to be able to change the html of the page before the user saves it. since I cannot seem to find a way to trigger the save as function from javascript except from IE, I need to just do some prep work before letting the browser save the page. I am not trying to force the user to do anything, just trying to update the page so that it saves its state to the actual html of the page being saved. I can do this with a button, but i have to then ask the user to press CtrlS which is not smooth at all.p  pSo I either need to be able to trigger a browser save from JavaScript, or handle the save event myself before allowing the default callback to happen. p  pCan this be done in a crossbrowser supported way I have found several pages dealing with the issue, but none clear it up as I wished, so sorry if this sounds like a duplicate.p

Negative 46426 pI dont have much experience with development in Android. I am working on app, which can communicate with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google. p  pEvery social network has own wrapper, which handles communication between Android app and social network. Facebook communication is already done. I have problems with Twitter communication. Implemetations, which I have found on internet use twitter4j library and internet browser for logging. Then you must read response data from browser.p  pFor example this a hrefhttpsgithub.compunitmgTwitterTestApp relnofollowTwitter Test Appap  pMy issue is reading this response data from browser. Logging and authorizing in browser goes without problems. Tutorials like I mentioned above use usually onNewIntent Activity method for dealing with browser response.

Negative 46426 pIm developing an application, in Java, that uploads data received from an Xbee device to an online database. The functionality is there and everything works, but when developing a GUI with WindowsPro Builder, everything goes sour. The thing is, the app needs to be able to detect the Xbee device and if not connected, wait for it to be connected  indefinitely or until closed. I already have a method that detects if the serial port is an Xbee device like I said, everything works, except when I integrate it with the GUI.p  pThe problem Im having is creating a GUI that first detects if an Xbee device is connected, and if not, display a message notifying the user to connect the device in order to continue. At the same time while displaying the message, I need to be calling the method that scans serial ports. Im thinking threads, but I havent used those in a while. Please note that the method already ran once, when the application started, in order to try and connect. Ive no code to show, since all I did was put up the basic frames, buttons, etc no events yet. Im new to GUI programming in Java, any suggestionsp  pstrongUpdatestrong So I kinda tried to implement what MadProgrammer suggested, which Im kinda convinced it works given the SwingWorker tutorial, but nothing happens.The only thing that runs is setting up the GUI.

Negative 46426 pIm running TorqueBox on Amazon AWS. Ive created a load balancer, which does TCP pass through for Web Socket connections on port 8675. When I first load up the page this seems to work quite nicely, however if I leave the page open for a while, the connection just stops working. I dont get an error message, it just silently ignores any further messages sent over the connection. If I reload the page at this point, everything works fine again.p  pIve tried connecting to individual nodes in the cluster directly, and the connection does not get dropped in that case, so my suspicion is that it has something to do with the load balancers.p  pAny ideas what might be causing thisp

Negative 46426 pI have two WCF services hosted in IIS running on a server Ogre C and Troll VB.Net. Yes, that is their real names.  In this process I call a web method in the Troll service.  The Troll in turn calls the Ogre for a supporting function.p  pWhen the Troll attempts to instantiate the Ogre service client  p  precodeDim ogre As New OgreService.OgreClient   codepre  pan exception is thrown.  That exception is  p  precodeOperations marked with IsOneWaytrue must not declare output parameters, byreference parameters or return values.   codepre  pNow, the ogre does have a few methods defined as one way.  However, they all return void and none have output parameters.  Some do accept an object defined in the data contract as a parameter.  There are several other programs that call the ogre without a problem.  Furthermore, if I run the Troll on my development system, in Visual Studio, it emdoes notem have a problem calling the ogre on the server. I can also call the ogre on the server from my development machine, using the WCF Test Client, and have no problems.p  pI know that this has got to be a configuration issue but I cant for the life of me figure out what it is.  Are there any issues with an IIS hosted WCF service calling another IIS hosted WCF service on the same machine  p  pIm not even sure what data I can provide that might be of help as it is only the one configuration that is experiencing the problem.  Any ideas of what might be going on would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p  hr  pIt turns out that this is a problem with the service proxy that Visual Studio generated.  When I configured the service reference I accidently checked the Allow generation of asynchronous operations.  The option to generate taskbased operations was selected.p  pThis caused methods to be defined with the oneway decoration that returned a value.p  pSo that is what caused the problem.  Since I dont need asynchronous operations I just unchecked that option and the problem went away.p  pIt does bring up other questions such as Why didnt it fail when running from my development machine and Why does the automatically generated client generate code that is not valid but that is for another discussion.p

Negative 46426 pI am using the a hrefhttpsimple.sourceforge.net relnofollowSimple XML Serializationa library in my Android app for parsing and mapping an XML response from a web service to objects, like sop  precodeRootnameroottag, strictfalse public class XMLRequest     Pathab   ElementListnamerouteList   private ListltRoutegt routes    public ArrayListltRoutegt getRoutes      return new ArrayListltRoutegtroutes     codepre  pI have several more dependent modelclasses like codeRoutecode written in a similar way with the proper annotations, the parsing an mapping works fine.p  pI now want to pass the codeRoutecode list to a new fragment and display it in a codeListViewcode. There are quite a lot of variables in several more modelclasses, so I just wanted those classes to implement codeParcelablecode and pass the list like this to my fragmentp  precodepublic static ResultFragment newInstanceArrayListltRoutegt routes      ResultFragment fragment  new ResultFragment      Bundle args  new Bundle     args.putParcelableArrayListROUTELISTKEY, routes     fragment.setArgumentsargs      return fragment    codepre  pMy problem I cant let the modelclasses implement codeParcelablecode, that breaks the mapping with the Simple framework. I also dont want to write new Parcelable model objects, thats redundant work which increases when I have to adjust my model classes. Putting every single variable in the bundle is also not an option, there are too many and also too many lists.p  pWhat I tried so far as a workaround is to pass the result string to the fragment instead of the objects and do the parsing and mapping there. But the process takes a while and I only want to do it once and just use my model objects from there on.p  pDoes anyone have a suggestion how I can solve this I would really like to keep the codeSimplecode mapping, because manual parsing and mapping via XMLPull would be a lot more work.

This requires them both being aligned to the topleft corner of codecontainercode. Normally, Id just use codeposition absolutecode with the defaults codetop 0code and codeleft 0code to superimpose them. The problem with this is that then the container collapses to 0px tall rather than the height of its contents, which I want, as codeacode and codebcode have been removed from the flow.p  pOk, so I cant user absolute positioning on codeacode and codebcode. How else can I get them to overlap A negative codemargintopcode also wont work since I dont know the heights of the children they can change dynamically based on their content, and there could be any number of them.p  pIs this even possible without JS If it isnt, whats the least hacky way that doesnt assume A a small number of children in codecontainercode or B the children are a fixed size known ahead of time or otherwise.p

Negative 46426 pI am using twisteds Perspective Broker for a network application. I encountered the problem that it automatically uses an MD5 challengeresponse scheme for authentication. Ideally I would prefer not to store MD5 hashes on the serverside due to a number of security vulnerabilities. Alternatively, scrypt, bcrypt or pbkdf2 provide more secure algorithms.p  pHowever, while these algorithms are readily available in python, I dont quite see, whether it is possible to implement a custom authentication scheme using the Perspective Broker. Judging from the source, it looks like MD5 is very tightly integrated within the system.p  pSo my question goes to more experienced twisted users is there a way to use a custom authentication scheme without having to rewrite the whole thingp  pAlso, please correct me, if any of my assumptions about twisted or cryptography are wrong. I am quite new to both.p

Negative 46426 pGiven is the following shortened threadedcode interpreter finite state machine. It has a operation stack and a operand stack. On execution, the next operation is popped from the operation stack and executed.p  pThere are three instructionsp  ul liThe emadditionem instruction, which pops two operands from the operand stack, adds them and pushes the result on the operand stackli liThe emprintem instruction, which pops one operand from the operand stack and prints it outli liThe emspecialcallem instruction, which tries to manually call the emadditionem instruction from within the instruction and needs to get the result of the calculationli ul  pNow the problem is, that in the specialcall method, the result of the calculation is needed, but after the addition operation was called in the instruction loop, further execution would simply continue right after the initial specialcall.p  pOne approach would be to create a operation struct which contains a the operation and b the address where to jump back  if necessary. Then in the instruction loop, when the instruction struct is popped and the address is set, a jump to this address would be made right after the execution of the actual instruction.p  pIs there any other way to solve this problemp  precodeinclude ltstdint.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltdequegt  const uint32t operationaddition  1 const uint32t operationprint  2 const uint32t operationspecialcall  3  stddequeltuint32tgt operations stddequeltuint32tgt stack  void specialcall      stdcout ltlt specialcall ltlt stdendl       Manually create the call     stack.pushback52     stack.pushback25     operations.pushbackoperationaddition       place to jump back       Need result of calculation here     ...   void addition      stdcout ltlt addition ltlt stdendl      uint32t operandA  stack.back     stack.popback     uint32t operandB  stack.back     stack.popback      uint32t result  operandA  operandB     stack.pushbackresult   void print      stdcout ltlt print ltlt stdendl      uint32t result  stack.back     stack.popback      stdcout ltlt result ltlt stdendl   void start      while operations.empty          uint32t op  operations.back         operations.popback          switch op          case operationspecialcall             specialcall             break         case operationprint             print             break         case operationaddition             addition             break                 int main      stack.pushfront25     stack.pushfront53     operations.pushfrontoperationaddition     operations.pushfrontoperationprint     operations.pushfrontoperationspecialcall     start      stdcout ltlt execution finished ltlt stdendl  codepre

Basically, the method will return codetruecode if any of the properties are strings with a value on the RootClass or anywhere on sublevels of the class for example, if codeRootLevel1ChildClass11code has a string property with a value.p  pHeres what I have so farp  precodepublic static bool ObjectHasStringDataltTgtthis T obj      var properties  typeofT.GetPropertiesBindingFlags.NonPublic  BindingFlags.Instance     foreach var property in properties              Type propertyType  property.PropertyType         if propertyType  typeofstring                      try                              if String.IsNullOrEmptyproperty.GetValueobj, null as string                     return true                          catch NullReferenceException    we want to ignore NullReferenceExceptions                  else if propertyType.IsValueType                      try                              if ObjectHasStringDataproperty.GetValueobj, null                     return true                          catch NullReferenceException    we want to ignore NullReferenceExceptions                   return false  codepre  pthis works great on the first layer so any codestringcode within the codeRootClasscode, but once I start using it recursively on the codeif ObjectHasStringDataproperty.GetValueobj, nullcode line, the return value of codeproperty.GetValuecode is codeobjectcode, so when calling the method recursively, codeTcode is codeobjectcode.p  pI can get the codeTypecode of the current object, but how do I convert the codeobjectcode returned from codeproperty.GetValuecode to the actual type of the propertyp

Negative 46426 pBackground on this project. It started as a simple homework assignment that required me to store 5 zip codes and their corresponding cities. When a user puts a Zip code in a textbox, a corresponding city is returned, and likewise the opposite can be done. I wrote the code to return these values, but then I decided I wanted to store ALL zip codes and their corresponding Cities in an external .csv, and store those values in arrays and run the code off that because if its worth doing, its worth overdoing To clarify, this is no longer for homework, just to learn more about using external files in C. p  pIn the following code, I have called to open the file successfully, now I just need help in figuring out how to pull the data that is stored in two separate columns one for city, one for zip code and store them in two arrays to be acted upon by the for loop.

However when I hardcoded a number in there even when it was the exact same number the variable would have echoed, it works just fine.p  pemMaybe the API doesnt play nicely with variables in that spot in the arrayem brI actually reset the variable manually with a number see below and it worked no problem.p  precodevalue  SOAPgtaddOrganisationparams groupSOAPgtgetLastResponse echo ltbrgtGroup .group.ltbrgt     group55     echo ltbrgtGroup .group.ltbrgt paramsarraySIDgtsid, useridgtuser, organisationidgtgroup, insertedbygt1 value SOAPgtaddUserToOrganisationparams codepre  pemAny stray spaces attached to that variableem brNone that I can see.p  pem...Maybe you pissed off the gnomes inside your computer that make it workem brQuite possibly but theyve put up with my abuse for so long, why the sudden uprisingp  pstrongMy best guessstrong  As far as I can tell, there just seems that there is something inherently unacceptable about using the output of getLastRequest, even though it just looks like a regular old number when echoed.

Negative 46426 pIm using TestNG and Selenium to perform parallel tests. This works great in Firefox and Chrome, but breaks in IE. The steps I have the web driver executing are as followp  ol liA browser instance is created using a parameter from testng.xml found belowli liAn available user is selected from a pool of test user credentialsli liThe user is logged inli liTests proceedli ol  pWhen IE launches its instances, all of them are assigned the same user. Furthermore, all instances appear to fight over which one has focus. Conversely, in Firefox and Chrome, all instances are appropriately assigned their own user and do not fight over focus.p  pBecause each IE instance uses the same user credentials, I get testing collisions and because they fight over which instance has focus, I get Selenium TimeoutExceptions due to waitForElementPresent commands.p  pMy hunch is that IE is simply incapable of having multiple unique instances open concurrently. Can anyone either confirm my suspicion or direct me as to how I might remedy the issue Thank you for your helpp  pFor reference, here is my testng.xml filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltDOCTYPE suite SYSTEM httptestng.orgtestng1.0.dtdgt ltsuite threadcount6 verbose0 nameCommand line suite paralleltestsgt      lt IE Tests gt     lttest nameSourceBoxUIIe preserveordertruegt         ltparameter namebrowser valueiegt         ltclassesgt             ltclass nameorg.familysearch.links.uitests.SourceBoxUITestgt         ltclassesgt     lttestgt     lttest nameEditPageIe preserveordertruegt         ltparameter namebrowser valueiegt         ltclassesgt             ltclass nameorg.familysearch.links.uitests.EditPageUITestgt         ltclassesgt     lttestgt     lttest nameLinksGadgetPageIe preserveordertruegt         ltparameter namebrowser valueiegt         ltclassesgt             ltclass nameorg.familysearch.links.uitests.LinksGadgetPageUITestgt         ltclassesgt     lttestgt     lttest nameAdminChangeLogIe preserveordertruegt         ltparameter namebrowser valueiegt         ltclassesgt             ltclass nameorg.familysearch.links.uitests.AdminChangeLogPageUITestgt         ltclassesgt     lttestgt     lttest nameAttachedToPageIe preserveordertruegt         ltparameter namebrowser valueiegt         ltclassesgt             ltclass nameorg.familysearch.links.uitests.AttachedToPageUITestgt         ltclassesgt     lttestgt     lttest nameChangeLogIe preserveordertruegt         ltparameter namebrowser valueiegt         ltclassesgt             ltclass nameorg.familysearch.links.uitests.ChangeLogUITestgt         ltclassesgt     lttestgt      lt Firefox Tests Would Be here gt     lt Chrome Tests Would Be Heregt    lt Command line test gt ltsuitegt lt Command line suite gt codepre
Negative 46426 pFirst, Im not exactly sure if this is an AFNetworking problem or CFNetwork.p  pI am using AFNetworking in an iOS app that downloads thousands of images. This is implemented via NSMutableURLRequest, AFHTTPRequestOperation with a AFHTTPResponseSerializer, NSOperationQueue The maxConcurrentOperationCount on the NSOperationQueue is set to 8 btw.p  pwhat im seeing is that while these images are downloading from the server, the memory footprint of my app goes up significantly. Using allocations in instruments XCode5, it looks like a lot of the memory goes to CFData in HTTPProtocolbytesAvailable in CFNetwork.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comswjcC.png altenter image description herep  pWhile i dont know anything about CFNetwork, i am just speculating that while images are downloading, some CFData is not being released, which leads to the temporary accumulation of a lot of memory.p  pJust to be clear, this memory is eventually released, somewhere, somehow, as i see the memory footprint go down in Instruments after a while, but what Im concerned abut is whats going on while the images download.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb5avh.png altenter image description herep  pThe strange things is that with maxConcurrentOperationCount8, you would think that no more than 8 images are downloaded at any one time...p  pIs this an issue that others have come across and if so, how to fix it can AFNetworking be configured in a way so this doesnt happenp  pThanks.p
Negative 46426 pI am working on a project that relies heavily on a timer.  I have seen 12 scenarios where the timer slows down and is not ticking every second as it should, but 1 secondtick takes 23 seconds.  Usually it is due to the entire computer slowing down and becoming very laggy.  I cannot replicate it, but some users have reported similar findings, and once they reset their computer, everything is as it should be.p  pMy question is, how does the timeoutinterval work  If the browser is bogged down, does it slow down the timer, or is it based off the CPUsystem time  Also, has anyone else had something similar happen, and if so, what types of things can I do to rectify the situation make a 15 second timer actually fire an event after 15 seconds even if the system is slowp

Negative 46426 pI am using JAXWS with the JAXWS reference implementation. Im creating a Web Service that gets XML to store and later can return that previously stored XML.p  precodeWebMethodoperationNamestore public void storeWebParamnameXML String XML    ...   WebMethodoperationNameretrieve public String retrieve    String s  XML   return s  codepre  pMy Interface uses the type String for the XML. When I send the XML data, I wrap the whole string into a CDATATag since I need to send characters like lt and  within the soap message. However when the Web Service later returns that XML data, strange things happenp  pIf the string is long enough, the WS wraps everything into CDATA, thats the way I want it.p  pHowever if the string is really short e.g. small XML instances, the single characters are escaped e.g. lt becomes amplt. This is NOT what I want because it makes it really hard to work with the data. Besides, if my string contains characters like codeampcode because I stored escaped text, this gets killed and becomes codeampampcodep  pHow can I force my Web Service to return the string always within CDATA and not escape anything by itself Simply appending codelt[CDATA[code and code]]gtcode before and after the string right before returning the value does not help because the CDATAMarkup itself then gets escaped.p  pBTW I think the fact that I store and retrieve XML does not even matter. The same would be the problem if I store usual strings containing characters like lt,  and amp which is essentially what I do. If I store them via CDATA but do not get them back via CDATA but with every single special characters escaped independently, I have to reconstruct the whole string by myself. How can I enforce the use of CDATA when returning stringsp

Negative 46426 pIm trying to write a pluginlike function in jQuery to add elements to a container with AJAX. It looks like thisp  precode.fn.cacheload  functionindex      var this  this     .getcache.php,  id index .donefunctiondata           cache.php returns ltdiv classentrygtContentltdivgt ...         data.insertAfterthis.last       codepre  pand I would like to use it like thisp  precodevar entries  div.entry,     id  28  entries.cacheloadid codepre  pThink that this would load another entrycontainer and add it to the DOM.p  pThis is works so far. But of course the variable that holds the cached jQuery object codeentriescode isnt updated. So if there were two divs in the beginning and you would add another with this function it would show in the DOM, but codeentriescode would still reference the original two divs only.p  pI know you cant use the return value of get because the AJAXcall is asynchronous. But is there any way to update the cached object so it contains the elements loaded via AJAX as wellp  pI know I could do it like this and requery after insertingp  precode    .getcache.php,  id num .donefunctiondata          data.insertAfterthis.last         entries  div.entry      codepre  pbut for this I would have to reference the variable holding the cached objects directly. Is there any way around this so the function is selfcontained I tried reassigning codethiscode, but got an error. code.addcode doesnt update the cached object, it creates a new temporary object. p  pThanks a lotp  p UPDATEp  pJohn S gave a really good answer below. However, I ended up realizing that for me something else would actually work better. Now the plugin function inserts a blank element synchronously and when the AJAX call is complete the attributes of that element are updated. That also ensures that elements are loaded in the correct order. For anyone stumbling over this, here is a JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJZsLt2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJZsLt2ap

Negative 46426 pWe have several international partnerswebsites that have complained about their traffic being stolen by our domestic site located in US.  I thought it best to implement a free geoip service to offer a redirect option to our international users to their appropriate site if they happen upon our domestic site.p  pAfter researching the free options, I found that MaxMind offers a complete package with an option for fairly accurate IPaddress data ipV4 and ipv6 included.  In fact, our management strongly suggests the use of MaxMinds implementation.p  pI recently downloaded MaxMinds free GeoLiteCity.dat and githubs C code for my domestic website.  I found the documentation to be quite vague as it relates to implementing their C code on anything but a console application.p  pBefore I implemented it on my current website  in my development environment, I successfully tested the implementation of the database, and the API on a console application and then successfully on a aspx page for a mockwebsite.  I am currently experiencing dreaded Object reference not set to an instance of an object errors in my development environment.p  pIve added the class library for MaxMind and also added reference to that class library.p  pHas anyone run into issues implementing MaxMinds data while using C code  Has anyone successfully utilized MaxMinds data and C code on a webform  I would appreciate any insight.  If you can provide a walkthrough of the implementation process and perhaps some sample C code that works or worked for you, I would truly appreciate it.p

Negative 46426 pAssume we have a clientserver application communicating over the net, with client side written in javascript so pretty much opensource. Lets say for example that we want to run multiplayer inbrowser game and gather some revenue from ads. We want to stay in business, so we keep secured the server part, which handles most of the logic, and we accept that frontendUI handling client is thrown into the wild and might be messed with by anyone.p  pQuestion is how to detect and prevent the situation where someone copies all public facing content of web app, including JS client, puts it on hisher own server with hisher own advertisements, potentially malware etc, while the hijacked client still talks to our original serverp  pOr perhaps thats just silly and there is some obvious reason why such behaviour would not work that might be why I havent found anyone mentioning it Im feeling like Im missing something there, but nothing in my experience so far tells me that hypothetical situation from the paragraph above would not be possible or even profitable for a highjacker.p

question is where do I go from here Ive attempted to find any more information about this error from google or other SO questions but everyone just keeps saying its because its missing a class, which is obvious but this only started happening after I started using maven so that must mean theres a dependency Im missing What would I need to include to stop this issuep  pAlso a side note the project builds when I run the mvn compile via command line on the correct folder, of course when running it it claims there is a cert issue, even though its the exact same code that was used before I switched to maven, which worked perfectly fine.p  palso if needed here is my POM for this projectp  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance

Negative 46426 pIm making some breadcrumbs and restricting the width of them using codetextoverflowcode so the text does not spill over. I have wrote a jQuery script which enlarges the size of the breadcrumb when the user hovers over it.p  pMy problem is that when the breadcrumb is enlarged, they end up too long to fit inside the container. I need to make the width of the other breadcrumbs smaller and at the same time, make the highlighted breadcrumb longer.p  pI have wrote a script for this but it is very buggy. The reason is that when other breadcrumbs are shrunk down in size, the position of the highlighted breadcrumb moves.p  pI would like the highlighted breadcrumb to expand in size emoutwardsem, so that it remains in the same position.

Negative 46426 pAs the title says, I am trying to implement a colorbox overlay whereby the overlay is positioned at the top, and the user cannot scroll up, hence showing the blackened areas if you are opening the overlay from the middle of a long page. This issue is particular annoying on mobile devices. Actually as an extension to this wish, it would be equally great if we could only scroll until the end of the overlay, and not past it.p  pThe first method to solve this would probably bep  pstrongThe Fixed position, top 0 methodstrongp  pProblem is this assumes your overlay is always within the window size. If your overlay is taller than the window size and requires scrolling to view it in its entirety, you cant scroll the overlay with the fixed positioningp  pThe ugly solution would be to do the above, keep the overlay in a conservative height and allow the scrolling parameter in colorbox. This however is unideal as it shows ugly scrollbars on certain browsers.p  pSo Im hoping if anyone knows of a way to prevent scrolling up perhaps, when the overlay is open For preventing scrolling down past the overlay, Im hoping for some javascript sages enlightenment.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 46426 pI need to plot over 10,000 points on a single scatter plot, and there are many points overlapping with each other. This makes the entire PDF file very large, which is undesired.p  pSince I am using codeggplot2code for producing all the plots, I wonder if there is any function that can avoid plotting the many overlapping points, say, using huesp  pI know that codestathexbincode may work in such cases, but I am thinking of some approach similar to the codesmoothScattercode function in baseR graphics. If we could use some kind of density presented in color gradient that would be great. Thanksp

Every form as you can imagine has his submit button.  Now what Im trying to do without any success is to send one of this form to my controller, but not the whole list of A that I render but A. So my controller will look something like.p  precode   RequestMappingvalue  save, method  RequestMethod.POST          public final ModelAndView saveModelAttributea A a  codepre  pBut Im receiving a IllegalStateException Neither BindingResult nor plain target object for bean name because the render name of my modelAndView aList is not the same than a.p  pWhat I think I understand is that Spring MVC components like form dont allow submit a different class that was used in the render. Even if is a nested class of the render class, what is too bad.p  pI would like to avoid have to send the aList again.p  pAny ideap  pRegards.p
Negative 46426 pIm launching a mobile version of an existing corporate web application that currently loads in an iframe for corporate authentication purposes.  When accessing the web apps direct link from a mobile device, it displays beautifully.  The problem is that when accessing through the iframe, the site doesnt seem to scale correctly and it looks more like Im accessing the desktop version of the site.  Any suggestions on how make the site within the iframe recognize the mobile devices width and adjust appropriately  Ive tried setting the viewport within the HTML and CSS of the site being loaded and even then Im not getting the change I expect on my iPhone.  I havent had the opportunity to test an Android yet but within our company, iOS is the most important.  Some of snippets of code I have tried are listed below.  Ive also tried 480px and devicewidth which I believe I cant access because the iframe is a different domain.p  pUnfortunately, modifying the iframe page and settings are not an option.

Negative 46426 pIm currently working on a C program in the a hrefhttpwww.lpcware.comlpcxpressoLPCXpresso eclipsebaseda toolchain on Windows 7, an IDE with gcc targeting the an NXP Cortex M3 microprocessor.  It provides a simple way to compilelinkprogram the microprocessor over JTAG.  The result of a build is an AXF file ELF format that is loaded by a debug configuration.p  pThe loaded program resides in Flash memory from 0x00000 to 0x3FFFB.  Id like to include a 4byte CRC32 at 0x3FFFC to validate the program at startup.  I added another section and use the gcc codeattributecode directive to access that memory location.p  precodeuint32t crc32build attribute section.textMFlashCRC codepre  pTo compute and store the CRC32 value, my plan was to use a hrefhttpsrecord.sourceforge.netSRecorda with the following postbuild stepsp  precodearmnoneeabisize BuildArtifactFileName armnoneeabiobjcopy O binary BuildArtifactFileName BuildArtifactFileBaseName.bin checksum p TargetChip d BuildArtifactFileBaseName.bin ..utilsreccat BuildArtifactFileBaseName.bin binary crop 0 0x3FFFC fill 0xFF 0x00000 0x3FFFC crc32be 0x3FFFC o BuildArtifactFileBaseName.crc.bin binary echo  echo CRC32 ..utilsreccat BuildArtifactFileBaseName.crc.bin binary crop 0x3FFFC 0x40000 o  hexdump codepre  pThis creates a binary with a checksum necessary for bootloader and then computes the CRC over the used Flash memory, storing the CRC value at 0x3FFFC.p  pHowever, I dont think I can load the binary file using the debugger.  There is a built in programming utility with LPCXpresso that can load the modified binary file, however, that doesnt let me debug.  I believe I can then try to start a debugging session with the original AXF file using attachonly mode, however, this becomes cumbersome.p  pIve been able to use readelf to inspect the codecrc32buildcode variable in the AXF file.  Is there a way to edit the variable in the AXF file  Is there an industrystandard approach to inserting a CRC as a postbuild stepp
Negative 46426 pWith much efforts, I finally was able to write a simple HTTPS server in Java to handle HTTPS requests.

Unfortunately when Im printing what the server has received, I dont see any POST data except codePOST run.html HTTP1.1code. What is the problem, and how can I add this feature into itp  pPS dont forget to create a keystore for the SSL and write the info in the code if you want to test.p  pThe POST request I get is this

Negative 46426 pI am new to coderegexcode and want to do the following task p  pI have a string say, codeJOHN.Scode and I would want to replace the period with tab. However, the replacement should only occur if the period is between two letters. Something that I dont want it to happen is to replace period in codeJohn, S.code with a tab. Instead, I will just replace code,code with a tab, which I know how to do. p  pIf I try to replace code[azAZ].[azAZ]code, then the surrounding letters will be removed but obviously I want to keep them. They should just be used to identify the context. p  pI have searched for a long time but have not come up a solution. More specifically, I am working with codebashcode.

Negative 46426 pI am working on a application that involves remote control. The keyboard and mouse state gets updated about 100 times a second, saved on arrays, sent on the internet, and reproduced. Perfect reproducing timing is required. Since now I only coded the keyboard part and it was actually easier to program than windows messaging. All I had to do is call GetAsyncKeystate every 9 milliseconds on the host, and then, on the client, use SendInput every 9 milliseconds to get perfect timing. The other side of the medal is, I will have to manually check if the host window is highlighted, and if is not, avoid calling GetAsyncKeyState. But now that im about to code the mouse part, I have a doubt about what method to use, since perfect timing for mouse will be difficult to achieve even  without window messaging. Thats why I am asking to programmers that are more experienced than me In this case, is it better to use a combination of GetAsyncKeyState and GetCursorPos or is it better to use Windows Messaging What are the positives and negatives of both Thanks in advance.p

Negative 46426 pIm new at using gitolite and have been doing some tests and there is one thing I dont understand. When a user generates its key say, pablo the idrsa.pub needs to be renamed to pablo.pub because it says in the file content pablopc10 and hence the username needs to match the name of the file. This work.p  pNow the problem is that there is another username pablo in another pc pc12. So I obviously cant add both keys to the keydir as they both have the same file name. I have tried to rename them to pablopc10.pub and pablopc12.pub, but this doesnt work whenever they try to clone the repository it asks for the gitolite3 password, which should not happen. I have also edited the conf file to reflect that the user is pablopc10 and pablopc12 after the RW  sentence.p  pMy question is, what am I doing wrong How do I add multiple keys for the same username on different machinesp

Negative 46426 pI have to write a code which will compare two CSVs which is sorted. CSVs are autogenerated and always have more than 600,000 rows with more than 140 columns. It is not necessary that comparison will happen row by row. Few of the cells will be treated as Primary Key and will be matched against the rows in CSV2 and as soon as the match is found, that particular row in CSV2 will be compared. But for this, I will need to iterate CSV2 again and again for finding the matching rows in CSV2 as it might happen that rows might be present in the beginning of CSV2 or in the very end. This will consume a lot of time. p  pAnother approach I took was to split the files according to size. But, there was one more problem with this approach as some of the lines also split into two in the files. For example, if files were divided into two, Row 320 was not complete as only a part of it was present in the file1 and rest of it was present in the File2.p  pUsing multithreading if each thread works on split files, there is one problem, as the header of the disk where the file is present will have to move as per each threads requirements.p  pAlso tried using JDBC CSVDriver, but OutOfMemoryException was thrown owing to large CSV file.p  pIs there any approach, where we can go forth and back in a CSV using any File Reader or CSV Reader. For example, using CSV reader object, say doing this csvReaderObject.get120 gets me 120th row or csvReaderObject.contains gets me the matching line numbers, something like that p

What it does   it starts a thread, picks up a url, opens the page and gets the text and finally writes that into the csv file.p  pThe NumThread parameter basically is the total number of  threads that the program should run. Each thread working is on a URL of its own. Then saving the data in a csv file.p  pError When I run this program with NumThread 1, it runs fine. But that is too slow and I wanted to make it faster. So I changed the parameter NumThread to higher values, but for all values 1, I get this error saying that program couldnt start the firefox browser for one of the threads actually and eventually all of the threads would stop working. Pls go to end for the error message.p  pI want to know what am I doing wrong here.p  pURL Sample a hrefhttpwww.facebook.compermalink.phpstoryfbid10204434388406719ampid1441642514 relnofollowhttpwww.facebook.compermalink.phpstoryfbid10204434388406719ampid1441642514ap  pCode p    precode    from selenium import webdriver     from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys     import csv     from threading import Thread     from Tkinter import Tk     from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename      Tk.withdraw we dont want a full GUI, so keep the root window from appearing     filename  askopenfilename  show an Open dialog box and return the path to the selected file.

Negative 46426 pI am building a 3rd party library ogre3d that I will statically link against. I am using c visual studio 2013. I have always built 3rd party static libraries from source code and then linked against them using the same compiler including compiler version number and configuration settings to ensure compatibility.p  pI like the way boost generates its library filenames by including compiler version and other flag settings to make things nice and easy.p  pHowever whilst building ogre it expects you to get about 10 3rd party dependencies admittedly only one is actually required. Whilst downloading the prebuilt binary dependencies static lib files they dont specify which compiler the lib was built with. So whats the point of supplying this Is it wiser to get the source code and build myself But if this dependency also has dependencies that I have to go and build then I could be doing this forever. Or are some static libraries safe to link against despite mismatched compilers Perhaps libraries built in C due to no name manglingp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 46426 pI am having trouble to set correctly the rows that I need to pass to a function. I have calculating functions and row selecting functions. The functions that I use to calculate are doing what I want.  The function must subset first codeestado3code that part goes fine then subset the correct row numbers and pass them to the calculating functions.p  pAs I said, my code to select should pick specific row numbers in this case 111, 2323, 4656 and 6878. The thing is Im trying to make this automatic for any data frames length. I should get this pattern rep 11 , 12 where I mean I have drop the first 11 between the first two dfs I pass to the calculating function and drop 12 between the first two and the next block and loop till the data frame is over see photo to get better undesrstanding. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsQvHc.png altenter image description herep  pThe row selecting is based on time you can see that theres a codetiempocode column so theres a little bit of calculating rows based on times tmuestreo, tpasaje, tentre.

Negative 46426 pWhen we change an icon foundry, it causes a minor snafu in that a lot of code needs to be revisited because icon names change. Some automated translation might be possible using text utils, but not when icon names are generated in a structured way e.g., istarfilled vs istarempty based on a boolean.p  pWhat I want instead is to use functional names for my icons such as xyzsearch, xyzcancel, xyzfilterable, etc. and then map them to the actual icon name provided by the foundry. For example, glyphicon names might be different from those used by font awesome. How can I provide some kind of indirection the same kind of liberation that HTML tags strong and em providep  pOur first thought was to use a lookup table in javascript to translate from one namespace into another. But that works only when the HTML is being generated we use angularjs not helpful for static code, nor in those few cases where the icon name is generated computationally, as in the example in the first para.p  pSo now we are toying with SASS I have googled a fair bit but all in vain, nor is my CSS very shiny. Is there a SASS idiom that fits here, to translate something likep  precodelti classxyzfilterable ...gt codepre  ptop  precodelti classifunnel ...gt codepre  pfor the same visual and interaction outcome. I understand the actual CSS will look quite differentp  pI do not want to use any foo.addClass.p  pThanksp

Negative 46426 pI have csv two files. Im trying to remove all rows where certain columns match. I thought Id use lists in Python to do this. I thought itd be fast, but its running way too slow.p  pI only want to compare the first 3 columns as the last 2 are unreliable.

However, my list A is 50,000 and list B is 600,000 rows. This is taking 3.5 hours. I need to run it on a set of 300,000 and 4,000,000 rows but after seeing how long this takes it will run for days.p  pHeres the two For Loops Im comparing columns 0, 7, 9, and 10.p  precodefor Acquisitionrow in Acquisitionlist[]     for Leadsrow in Leadslist         if Acquisitionrow[0]  Leadsrow[0] and Acquisitionrow[7]  Leadsrow[7] and Acquisitionrow[9]  Leadsrow[9] and Acquisitionrow[10]  Leadsrow[10]             try                 Acquisitionlist.removeAcquisitionrow                 Leadslist.appendAcquisitionrow             except                 printError codepre  pIs there any way to speed this up Is there a better approach Should I use a different programming language Maybe upload these to a temp table in SQL db and use SQLp  pThanksp

Negative 46426 pI have a working android app that uses the camera to track a red ball uses opencv.  Now I would like to control two servos using a IOIO board. p  pThe problem I am having is getting the two codes into onecombining them.p  pTrying to use the demo app that came with the IOIO library, it requires IOIOActivity to be extended but my main code already extends Activity and you cant extend two classes in one line.  p  pIf you would have any suggestions on how to accomplish this I would be grateful.p  pIve attached the code here a hrefhttppastebin.comaBgyKxSb relnofollowMy Opencv code on Pastebinap  pIve tried a few things but nothing has worked. The most successful one involved adding the entire demo code to the main code but it never ran the bit that would set the ledset the servo.  I would just like to get the led working, then modifying to get the servos to work should be easier.p

Negative 46426 pI am currently working on a project with UE4 and wrote a heightmapgenerator and combined him with a delaunaytriangulator. Then I have to read the trianglesvertices from an outputfile. But I have a problem with the UVs. Every vertex wants to get a U and a V variable defined, but I have no clue how to calculate them. Basically, the texture I put on the final mesh should look like one big texture. The only thing I got working while just playing with the values in the range of 01 is that every triangle has a texture displayed, but not aligned to all the others, so it looks like a nuclear power plantexplosion.p  pHere is the code where I read all vertices from two files and specify the UVs  sort of randomly.p  precodeinStream gtgt vertexCount gtgt buffer gtgt buffer  first element is the number of elements  skip second and third      TArrayltFProceduralMeshTrianglegt triangles     for int i  0 i lt vertexCount i         FProceduralMeshTriangle triangle         FProceduralMeshVertex v0, v1, v2         int i1, i2, i3         inStream gtgt buffer gtgt i1 gtgt i2 gtgt i3         i1         i2         i3         v0.Position.X  nodes[i1].X         v0.Position.Y  nodes[i1].Y         v0.Position.Z  vectorPoints[nodes[i1].X][nodes[i1].Y].first         v0.Position.Z  5         v0.U  0.0         v0.V  0.5          v1.Position.X  nodes[i2].X         v1.Position.Y  nodes[i2].Y         v1.Position.Z  vectorPoints[nodes[i2].X][nodes[i2].Y].first         v1.U  0.5         v1.V  0.5          v2.Position.X  nodes[i3].X         v2.Position.Y  nodes[i3].Y         v2.Position.Z  vectorPoints[nodes[i3].X][nodes[i3].Y].first         v2.U  0.0         v2.V  0.0          triangle.Vertex0  v0         triangle.Vertex1  v1         triangle.Vertex2  v2         triangles.Addtriangle      codepre  pThanks for your helpp  pWireframe img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOmMO6.png altWireframep  pWith material specified img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyI4FM.jpg altWith Materialp  pEditp  pOkay, I added the following code p  precodedouble range  lowestX  highestX1     double offset  0  lowestX      for int i  0 i lt triangles.Num i         FProceduralMeshVertex vT         vT  triangles[i].Vertex0         vT.U  vT.Position.X  offset  range         vT.V  1  vT.U         triangles[i].Vertex0  vT          vT  triangles[i].Vertex1         vT.U  vT.Position.X  offset  range         vT.V  1  vT.U         triangles[i].Vertex1  vT          vT  triangles[i].Vertex2         vT.U  vT.Position.X  offset  range         vT.V  1  vT.U         triangles[i].Vertex2  vT      codepre  pNow it doesnt look like a nuclear accident anymore, but the texture is stretched about the whole mesh, instead of repeating and it is still slighly distorted..p

Negative 46426 pWell I have this situation where I should authenticate user with CakePHP 2.x site which is using blowfish to save password and I am using GCM for push notifications.p  pI am thinking it this way. First I will generate a registration ID for the device and then use the web view to open a custom login page designed for android in Server. There if the user successfully authenticates, his device id, registration id and the site recognized username are stored in a table. All requests with saved device id and registration id are used to authenticate a user and perform his actions. There would be mechanisms to control the problems with registration id where it gets deactivated or re issued.p  pDoes this have any security issues or design flawsp

Negative 46426 pI have a function in JS view which performs some action if the window width is less than 1000. Im attempting to write unit tests for this with Mocha, chai and running the tests via karma test runner in PhantomChromeChromium browser.p  pI also use sinon to stub the methods and making it to return some desired value.

Negative 46426 pWhat I want to achieve. I have a class that has some propertiesobjects in it. I want to serialize only those objects which meet the CanConvert condition with my custom serializer, others should be handled defaultly. p  pProblem is that with code[JsonConvertertypeofUnityObjectConverter]code it serializes correctly but deserialization fails. Probably because I save only path to the object, not the whole object and when some internal check which I dont get why occurs than it fails and returns null, because the codeReadJsoncode is never called. p  pWhen I use Settings, it causes more problems to me, that it solves because it does not serialize the rest. I dont want to have serialization for the whole class, because that way it wouldnt be very universal since several objects inherit that class. The class itself is not abstract so there might be some objects using just the class. I would be really glad if someone could help.

Ive tried looking at the elements in the inspector when the dropdown is clicked on the times its not working, and I can see the events triggering.  The codeli.dropdowncode is supposed to have the codeopencode class added to it, and codeariaexpandedcode is supposed to change from codetruecode to codefalsecode. This is what happens when it is working. However, when its not working, the elements stay the same, but simply briefly highlight in the inspector Chrome, as elements do when theyre being changed.p  pThis tells me the JS is loading, since its at least responding to the click event. But nothing else happens.p  pIve tried looking for patterns. Refreshing sometimes fixes it, but other times triggers the problem.

I havent been able to find a way to install it for python 3.  I tried codebrew install pillow3code but no luck.  Ive found a post on SO that says to first install pip3 with Homebrew and then use codepip3 install pillowcode.  As it happens, I have already installed pip3.p  pIve never understood the difference, if any, between installing a python package  with pip and installing it with Homebrew.  Can you explain it to me  Also, is it preferable to install with Homebrew if a formula is available  If installing with Homebrew is indeed preferable, do you know how to install pillow for python 3 with Homebrewp  pThe first answers indicate that I havent made myself plain.  If I had installed pillow with codepip install pillowcode instead of codebrew install pillowcode would the installation on my system be any different  Why would Homebrew make a formula that does something that pip already does  Would it check for additional prerequisites or something  Why is there a formula for pillow with python2, but not as far as I can tell for pillwo with python3     p

Negative 46426 pIf I want to inherit environment variables to child processes, i do something likep  precodeexport MYVARtork codepre  pAssume I have a a file codesite.confcode containing assignments of values that can contain spaces to variablesp  precodeEMAILdevexample.com FULLNAMEMaster Yedi FOObar codepre  pNow I would like to process this file whenever I open a new shell e.g. with some code in code.bashrccode or code.profilecode, so that any processes started from within that newly opened shell will inherit the assignments via environmental variables.p  pThe obvious solution would be to prefix each line in codesite.confcode with an codeexportcode and just source the file. However I cannot do this since the file is also read directly by some other applications, so the format is fixed.p  pI tried something likep  precodecat site.conf  while read assignment do   export assignment done codepre  pBut this doesnt work, for various reasons the most important being that codeexportcode is executed in a subshell, so the variable will never be exported to the children of the calling shell.p  pIs there a way to programmatically codeexportcode unknown variables in bashp
Negative 46426 pIve installed FreeSwitch and managed to get it up and running on CentOS 6. I can connect to my instance using a SIP application XLite and make calls between extensions.br What Ive done is used the out of the box default configuration but it seems to me the default configuration is too much for my purpose.br I want my instance only connect internal extensions, there is no calling outside, there is no real dial plans, simplest of all. I like to be able different extensions to call each other, not even voice mail is required.br I was wondering if there is a simplest configuration I can use. The reason I need this is the default configuration is not fast enough and when an extension makes a call to the next it takes around 5 seconds before I heard the ringing and I was hoping by disabling all the features I dont really need I can make this process faster.  p  pSo the question isbr 1 Is there a bare bone simplest configuration I can usebr 2 Is really the cause of the delay I see in configuration or there might be other reasons  p  pAgain remember this is a out of the box installation, all Ive done checked out the code and built the code and run the instance.  p  pThanks in advance.p
