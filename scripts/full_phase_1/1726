Positive 1726 pI am trying my best to render a texture to the screen. Ive also tried to render a sprite but none has succeeded. From my understanding the camera needs a viewport and its best to use world units when rendering your world. I get the idea about units and it makes sense. But if you say your world is 100X100 then your sprite background must also be 100X100. I still dont get it how is supposed to cover the entire device screenandroid phone. I guess providing assets at different resolutions or implementing a stretchviewport might be ideal. Also, I am trying to implement the private moveCamera method. My goal is  to have the camera move in random ways displaying parts of my texture. When i ran the code for the first time, I saw that the camera moved but then the screen turned red and then black. I think I might have to clamp the camera to force it to stay within the bounds of the asset.

Positive 1726 pSo Ive used the program CloudCompare and its implementation of the Poisson Surface Reconstruction algorithm to create a watertight mesh. There are no problems with the mesh, but I want the areas that were filled in using Poisson to appear equally as rough as the rest of the mesh. Due to the nature of the algorithm, any mesh created to fill in holes are smooth, making it look unnatural when compared to an area next to it that had points. Is there a way to somehow grab the feel or roughness of the surrounding area and apply it on the areas that were generated Ive looked into displacement maps and normal maps, but from what Ive found that pertains to overlaying the map from a highres model onto a lowres model. p

Positive 1726 pIm working on a project using OpenSceneGraph where I need to send a vertex texture to a vertex program, but no matter how many times Ive tried and looked for errors, I just cant seem to figure out why the texture never reaches the shader program.

Positive 1726 pI want to create a tooltip box, with a texture, which is technically a rounded rectangle, with a slightly brighter border. I want to make this tooltip be able to be scaled.p  pI could do this by cutting a image of a rounded rectangle into 8 pieces, and fill the inside, depending on how big it is with a colored quad.p  pBut is there a way to handle this better It should not scale the border, so it doesnt look different everytime.p
Positive 1726 pIve got a question about libGDX collision detection. Because its a rather specific question I have not found any good solution on the internet yet.p  pSo, I already created humans that consist of different body parts, each with rectangleshaped collision detection.p  pNow I want to implement weapons and skills, which for example look like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comkGDXy.png relnofollowSkill example imageap  pstrongProblemstrongp  pWorking with rectangles in collision detections would be really frustrating for players when there are skills like this They would dodge a skill successfully but the collision detector would still damage them.p  pstrongApproach 1strongp  pBefore I started working with Libgdx I have created an Android game with a custom engine and similar skills. There I solved the problem following wayp  ol liDetect rectangle collisionli liCalculate overlapping rectangle sectionli liCheck every single pixel of the overlapping part of the skill for transparencyli liIf there is any nontransparent pixel found  Collisionli ol  pThats a kind of heavy way, but as only overlapping pixels are checked and the rest of the game is really light, it works completely fine.p  pAt the moment my skill images are loaded as TextureRegion, where it is not possible to access single pixels. I have found out that libGDX has a Pixmap class, which would allow such pixel checks. Problem is having them loaded as Pixmaps additionally would 1. be even more heavy and 2. defeat the whole purpose of the Texture system.p  pAn alternative could be to load all skills as Pixmap only. What do you think Would this be a good way Is it possible to draw many Pixmaps on the screen without any issues and lag p  pstrongApproach 2strongp  pAn other way would be to create Polygons with the shape of the skills and use them for the collision detection. p  pstrongastrong But how would I define a Polygon shape for every single skill there are over 150 of them Well after browsing a while, I found this useful tool a hrefhttpwww.aurelienribon.comblogprojectsphysicsbodyeditor relnofollowhttpwww.aurelienribon.comblogprojectsphysicsbodyeditora it allows to create Polygon shapes by hand and then save them as JSON files, readable by the libGDX application. Now here come the difficultiesp  ul liThe Physics Body Editor is connected to Box2d which I am not using. I would either have to add the whole Box2d physics engine which I do not need at all just because of one tiny collision detection OR I would have to write a custom BodyEditorLoader which would be a tough, complicated and timeintensive taskli liSome images of the same skill sprite have a big difference in their shapes like the second skill sprite example. When working with the BodyEditor tool, I would have to not only define the shape of every single skill, but I would have to define the shape of several images up to 12 of every single skill. That would be extremely timeintensive and a huge mess when implementing these dozens of polygon shapesli ul  pstrongbstrong If there is any smooth way to automatically generate Polygons out of images, that could be the solution. I could simply connect every sprite section to a generated polygon and check for collisions that way. There are a few problems thoughp  ul liIs there any smooth tool which can generate Polygon shapes out of an image and does not need too much time thereforli liI dont think that a tool like this if one exists can directly work with Textures. It would probably need Pixmaps. It would not be needed to keep te Pixmaps loaded after the Polygon creation though. Still an extremely heavy taskli ul  pstrongMy current thoughtsstrongp  pIm stuck at this point because there are several possible approaches but all of them have their difficulties. Before I choose one path and continue coding, it would be great if you could leave some of your ideas and knowledge.p  pThere might be helpful classes and code included in libGDX that solve my problems within seconds  as I am really new at libGDX I just dont know a lot about it yet.p  pCurrently I think I would go with approach 1 Work with pixel detection. That way I made exact collision detections possible in my previous Android game. p  pWhat do you thinkp  pGreetings Felixp
Positive 1726 pI want to render two textures side by side. And then consider such combination of these two textures as one sprite to use a single camera.

Positive 1726 pI used the jsc3d viewer to import a group parts of a 3d object in .obj format with texture defined. And i would like to be able to assign new textures to each separate part.  For example, i have my .obj file loaded, with 10 differents parts. All the parts are completely white. I have 3 textures in .png format red, blue and green. i want to assign the texture red to some parts, the textures blue and green to the others. And i want to be able to modify them. How to do thatp  pThanks for your helpp

Positive 1726 pat the moment, I am rendering a camera to a texture and put the texture on a plane mesh. This works, in the scene the texture was recorded from.p  pWhen putting the same mesh into a different scene, which is running in a div, the mesh shows up, without texture. Same, when I put the texture on a mesh, which is created in the div scene.p  pThe mesh seems to have a texture, because it is black and not red, as initialized. When leaving away the texture, it does show up in red.p  pWhen I put the mesh into both scenes, which is the main scene and the divscene, the mesh only shows in the main scene, the camera takes its shots from, regardless which one addad first into its scene.p  pPlease be so kind and tell me, how I can use this texture, in a different scene.p  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 1726 pOn the first place I want to make clear that Im not talking about aspect ratio, Im already using OrthographicCamera with Viewports and them work fine. My problem is about images resolution, what happens is that if I create an image on Photoshop lets assume it is a 128x128 .png and then I put it as a texture in my 128x128 sprite it seems to look fine on my device. Then I try the same screen an another device with a lower resolution and the final effect is quite ugly. On the other hand if I put an image with an higher resolution for instance a 512x512 .png texture in a sprite sized as 128x128 it looks ugly on my highresolution device. So whatever I do on Photoshop Im not able to achieve a nice effect on every device. How can I handle itp
Positive 1726 pSince yesterday I have been experiencing some odd behaviour on my PC.p  pPlaying WoW, the screen did go black for a moment, then a Driver stopped working and was restarted message popped up. p  pIcons for some spells glitched out however, in the screenshot they appear black but were more like a glitchy mess a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1SGz5.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1SGz5.jpg altenter image description herea.

Looked like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPIN5l.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPIN5l.jpg altenter image description hereap  pAfter reboot, playing WoW screen flickered a few times and then just went blank. A staticish RRRRRR sound came from the speakers and had to force shutdown.p  pThis happened with a Radeon HD 7750 on Windows 10, with the latest drivers. Today I ran a few tests with my spare HD 7450. Running a WoW flight path caused the screen to flicker and textures to get corrupted, BUT no driver error Instead WoW reported a problem but did not crash.p  pAfter that I ran FurMark, GPU load was at 99 for around 15 minutes with no glitching at all.p  pHere is the interesting part. I wanted to test CPU as well, to do that I used JamSoftware HeavyLoad. The software offers an option to stress GPU as well.

Positive 1726 pIve run into a bit of a confusing problem with OpenGL, its rather simple but Ive failed to find any directly related information.p  h3What Im trying to doh3  pIm creating several new textures every frame, and right after creation I bind them, use them for drawing, and then delete them right after.p  h3The Problemh3  pIf I delete every texture right after it was used, the last one to be drawn replaces the previous onesbut their different geometry works as it should. If I batch my deletions after all drawing has been done, it works as expected, but if I do any draw calls at all after deleting the textures, the texture used in the last drawcall replaces the old oneswhich could be some common permanent sprite texture.p  h3Results from debuggingh3  pIve tried using glFlush, which didnt seem to do anything at all, not deleting the textures at all gives the correct behaviour, and also not drawing anything at all between deleting the textures and calling SwapBuffers works.p  h3Codeh3  pThis is not what my code looks like, but this is what the relevant parts boil down top  precodeint Tex1, Tex2, Tex3 glGenTextures1, ampTex1 glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, Tex1  ... Fill Texture with data, set correct filtering etc. glDrawElementsGLTRIANGLES, ...  Using Tex1   glGenTextures1, ampTex2 glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, Tex2  ... Fill Texture with data, set correct filtering etc. glDrawElementsGLTRIANGLES, ...  Using Tex2   I delete some textures here. glDeleteTextures1, ampTex1 glDeleteTextures1, ampTex2   If I comment out this section, everything works correctly  If I leave it in, this texture replaces Tex1 and Tex2, but  the geometry is correct for each geometry batch. glGenTextures1, ampTex3 glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, Tex3  ... Fill Texture with data, set correct filtering etc. glDrawElementsGLTRIANGLES, ...  Using Tex3  glDeleteTextures1, ampTex3   ... SwapBuffers codepre  pI suspect this might have something to do with OpenGL buffering my draw calls, and by the time they are actually processed the textures are deleted It doesnt really make sense to me though, why would drawing something else emafterem deleting the previous textures cause this behaviourp  h3More contexth3  pThe generated textures are text strings, that may or may not change each frame, right now I create new textures for each string each frame and then render the texture and discard it right after. The bitmap data is generated with Windows GDI.p  pIm not really looking for advice on efficiency, ideally I want an answer that can quote the documentation on the expectedcorrect behaviour for rendering using temporary textures like this, as well as possible common gotchas with this approach.p
Positive 1726 pI using the texture atlas in my project, and it works well. But when I try to using the filtering, there has a problem is the coordinate is not exact. brbrstrongFor examplestrongbr My big texture UV coordinate is [0,0][1,1], and i pick a tile is [0.2, 0.2][0.5, 0.5], when i render i open the linear filter, and the filter will get the neighbor coordinate, so maybe will the [0.19, 0.19] to compute will my tile edge coordinate. brOf course i have the border for my texture atlas, but i dont want the neighbor coordinate to be compute together, i want to have a edge, not mater what i do, the compute edge always [0.2, 0.2]  [0.5, 0.5], it wont offset my coordinate range.brbr strongProblem 2strongbr When i using the tile textureUV [0.2, 0.2]  [0.5, 0.5] to do the Gaussian Blur effect, and i will need to pick the texture pixel offset, maybe is 8 pixel,  so also i will get the out of my want edge [0.2, 0.2]  [0.5, 0.5], maybe will get more [0.1, 0.1]  [0.6, 0.6]. br strongbrSo i very confuse for this, is that have good way to solve this problemstrongp

Positive 1726 pWhat I want to do is to create a texture based on the RGB values of one surface, and the alpha of another.p  pIn the context of my program, I have two spritesheets, one with the colors and textures I want to use, and one containing the corresponding masks. The reason for having them in two separate files is so that I can mix and match different textures to different masks to get any combination I want.p  pIve tried creating a new surface which I copy the texture onto, then the mask and apply a colorkey to, which is then rendered, however I found this to be extremely slow  I need to perform this action several times every frame.p  pI would really appreciate any tips or advice anyone can givep

Positive 1726 pI would like to know how can I rotate a texture paint with image in java.p  pNormally it is easy to rotate the Graphics2D g2 object, but I dont want to do that.

Positive 1726 pCurrently my application has a major bottleneck when it comes to GPU CPU data sharing. p  pBasically I am selecting multiple items, each item becomes a buffer and then becomes a 2D texture of the same size and they all get blended together on the GPU. After which I need to know various things about the blend result. Which is on the GPU as a single channel float texturep  ul liMaximum amp Minimum value in the textureli liAverage valueli liSum Valueli ul  pEffectively I ended up with the very slow round about of p  ul liPut data on the GPU  Nli liRead data from GPUli liCycle data on CPU looking for valuesli ul  pObviously a CPU profile shows the 2 major hot spots as the writes and the read. the textures are in the 100x100s not 1000x1000s but there are a lot of them.p  pThere are 3 things I am currently consideringp  ol liCombine all the data amp find out interesting data before putting on GPU seems pointless putting it on the GPU at all amp some of the blends are complexli liWhen loading the data put it all onto the GPU as texture levels, therefore skipping the lag on item selection in favor of a slower loadli liCalculate the interesting data on the GPU and just have the CPU read back those values li ol  pOn my machine and the data I have worked with, throwing all the data on the GPU would barely use the GPU memory. Highest I have seen so far is 9000 entries of 170 X 90, as its single channel float, by my maths that comes out as 12 GB. Which isnt a problem on my machine, but I could see it being a problem on the average laptop. Can I get a GPU to page from HDD Is this even worth pursuing p  pSorry for asking such a broad question but I am looking for the most fruitful avenue to pursue and each avenue would be new ground to me. Profiling seems to highlight readback as the biggest problem at the moment. Could I improve this by changing FBOTexture settingsp  pAt the moment I am working in SharpGL and preferably need to stick to OpenGL 3.3. If however there is a route for rapid improvement in performance for any particular technique that is out of reach via either video memory or GL version I might be able to make a case to up the software system requirements.  p
Positive 1726 pwhat I am trying to do is developing my own path tracer. Actually I am using a framework provided by my professor in c, which is a really basic path tracer. What I have to do is applying a new gradient domain algorithm by modifying this path tracer and checking the results. According to the algorithm I have sometimes to check if the object that I am hitting is specular or diffuse.  The paper explicitly says emstrongWe classify all path vertices as either specular, or nonspecular, based on a threshold on the roughness of the BRDFstrongem. What I dont know to do is how to check it out. According to the framework a Material is specified like thisp  precodepublic  constructor  destructor Material Material  get  set void SetName const char Name  char GetName  return name  void SetColor vec3 Color   color  Color  vec3amp GetColor  return color  void SetTexture Texture Texture   texture  Texture  Texture GetTexture  return texture  void SetNormalMap Texture Normals   normalMap  Normals  Texture GetNormalMap  return normalMap  void SetIndex int Idx   idx  Idx  int GetIndex  return idx   methods void Init char Texture  void Init char Texture, char NormalMap  0   data members codepre  pprivate     Texture texture     Texture normalMap     vec3 color     char name     int idx p  pand a Texture is an object defined likep  precodeclass Texture  public  constructor  destructor Texture Texture const char File  Texture  get  set uint GetID  return id  void SetID uint ID   id  ID  void SetName const char Name  char GetName  return name  bool HasAlpha  return hasAlpha  void SetAlpha bool Alpha   hasAlpha  Alpha   methods void Load const char File  void sRGBtoLinear unsigned char Data, uint Size, uint Stride   data members uint id, width, height uint idata float fdata char name bool hasAlpha codepre  pp  pNow, according to this data, how can I check out if the material is diffuse or specularp

Positive 1726 pI am using this code to give multiple effect on bitmap that is on GlSurfaceView. a hrefhttpgrishma102.blogspot.in201310applyeffectsonimageusingeffects.html relnofollowapplyeffectsonimageusingeffectsap  pNow, I want to save the bitmap. They have given the code to save the bitmap but with that, whole GlSurfaceView is going to be saved as bitmap image. Instead I want to save only bitmap area to save as Image. p  pThere is method that takes pixels and make bitmap from that and also make image. e.g. p  precode  public Bitmap takeScreenshotGL10 mGL    final int mWidth  mEffectView.getWidth   final int mHeight  mEffectView.getHeight   IntBuffer ib  IntBuffer.allocatemWidth  mHeight   IntBuffer ibt  IntBuffer.allocatemWidth  mHeight     mGL.glReadPixels0, 0, mWidth, mHeight, GL10.GLRGBA, GL10.GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, ib      Convert upside down mirrorreversed image to rightside up normal    image.   for int i  0 i lt mHeight i     for int j  0 j lt mWidth j      ibt.putmHeight  i  1  mWidth  j, ib.geti  mWidth  j            Bitmap mBitmap  Bitmap.createBitmapmWidth, mHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB8888   mBitmap.copyPixelsFromBufferibt   return mBitmap   codepre  pI guess, I need to update it like, instead it to be start with 0, 0, that should be start with bitmap top left coordinate.

Negative 1726 pHow can my app get a valid last time connected to domain timestamp from Windows, even when the app is running offlinep  pBackground I am writing an application that is run on multiple client machines throughout my company.  All of these client machines are on one of the AD domains implemented by my company.  This application needs to take certain measures if the client machine has not communicated with the AD for a period of time.p  pAn example might be that a machine running this app is stolen.  After e.g. 4 weeks, the application refuses to work because it detects that the machine has not communicated with its AD domain for 4 weeks.p  pNote that this must not be tied to a user account because the app might be running as a Local Service account.  It the computerdomain relationship that Im interested in.p  pI have considered and rejected using codeWinNTltdomaingtltmachinegt,usercode because it doesnt work while offline.  Also, any codeLDAP...code lookups wont work while offline.p  pI have also considered and rejected scheduling this query on a dayly basis and storing the timestamp in the registry or a file.  This solutions requires too much setup and coding. Besides this value simply MUST be stored locally by Windows.p

Good so far.p  pWhat Id like to do is link foo.exe and bar.dll so they are one assembly, foo.exe.  I would prefer to be able to do this in VS2008, but if I have to resort to a commandline tool like al.exe I dont mind so much.p

Negative 1726 pIm working with NHibernate and need to retrieve and process up to 2 million rows.  Ideally, I could process each row  one at a time  without NHibernate loading all 2 million in memory at once because, you know, that hurts.  p  pId prefer to get an IEnumerable which would call the data reader iteratively for each read so I could process the data read  then discard it.  By doing it this way I save a boatload of memory, and begin processing results far faster.  I could also improve performance through multithreading andor the use of PLinq.p  pIs this possible with NHibernates ICriteria  Everything it returns seems to be IList, and fully loaded before handing the collection reference off.  Why IList instead of IEnumerablep  pI dont mean lazy in the traditional sense that NHibernate uses with regards to loading child or parent objects.  I want a stronglazy IEnumerable meaning someway of getting a IEnumerable from an ICriteria objectstrong.  ICriteria only has a List method which loads the results in an ArrayList.p
Negative 1726 pBasically what I want to do is allow a user to type in a string value and have the list box scroll to the item that matches the text they have typed or the first LIKE match.p  pIf I use the .ScrollIntoView method, the problem is that it puts the item at teh bottom of the visible area if the item is further down in the list than the current scroll position, and it is at the top if it is higher in the  list than the current scroll position.  I want to make it consistent by making it the top item in the list unless of course it cant be due to being one of the last page of items.p  pI have tried to fake it by selecting the item which is emxem further down in the list where x is the number of items visible.  This works when going down but breaks when going back up. and Ive been unable to determine which index is currently the one at the top visible spot in my list.p  pWinForms list boxes have the .TopIndex property which des exactly what Im looking for, but Ive been unable to find the WPF equivalent.  Anyone out there have an idea how to accomplish thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1726 pI would like input on the design I currently have planned.p  pBasically, I have some number of external instrumentation, each of which should always be running, collecting specific data. My thought was to create a service for each, always running and polling the instruments, performing logging, etc. There could be one instrument, or there could be 40. p  pHowever, I need one application to consume all this data, run some math on it, and do the charting, display, emailing, etc. The kicker is that even if this application is not running, the services should constantly be consuming data. Also, these services should almost always be supposed to run on the same machines as the client application itself, but the ability to network them like .NET Remoting used to do could be an interesting feature.p  pMy question is... is this the best design If it is, how do I go about doing the communication between services and application Ive looked into WCF, but it seems to be geared towards requestresponse web services, not something that is continually streaming data to anything that might listen to it. Alternatively, should I have these services contact some other Web Service using WCF, that then compiles the data for use in a thin client viewer that polls the web service oftenp  pAny links and resources would be greatly appreciated. .NET namespaces for me to research are also appreciated. If I wasnt clear about something let me know.p

Negative 1726 pI have 3 processes which need to be synchronized. Process one does something then wakes process two and sleeps, which does something then wakes process three and sleeps, which does something and wakes process one and sleeps.  The whole loop is timed to run around 25hz caused by an external sync into process one before it triggers process two in my real application.  I use sempost to trigger wake each process, and semtimedwait to wait for the trigger.  p  pThis all works successfully for several hours.  However at some random time usually after somewhere between two and four hours, one of the processes starts timing out in semtimedwait, even though I am sure the semaphore is being triggered with sempost.  To prove this I even use semgetvalue immediately after the timeout, and the value is 1, so the timedwait should have been triggered.  p  pPlease see following codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include lttime.hgt include ltstring.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltsemaphore.hgt  semt triggersem1, triggersem2, triggersem3   The main thread process.

I can see from the output that the semaphore is being triggered, and when I print the value after the timeout, it is 1.  So semtimedwait should have woken up well before the timeout.  I would never expect the value of the semaphore to be 1 after the timeout, save for the very rare occasion almost certainly never but its possible when the trigger happens after the timeout but before I call semgetvalue.p  pAlso, once it begins to fail, every semtimedwait on that semaphore also fails in the same way.  See the following output, which Ive linenumberedp  precode01  sem3 wait sync sem3. val before 0 02  sem1 wakeup. 03  sem1 send sync sem2. val before 0 04  sem2 wakeup. 05  sem2 send sync sem3. val before 0 06  sem2 wait sync sem2. val before 0 07  sem1 wait sync sem1. val before 0 08      sem3 semtimedwait failed Connection timed out, val now 1 09  sem3 send sync sem1. val before 0 10  sem3 wait sync sem3. val before 1 11  sem3 wakeup. 12   sem3 not sending sync, val 1 13  sem3 wait sync sem3. val before 0 14  sem1 wakeup. [...] codepre  pOn line 1, thread 3 which I have confusingly called sem3 in the printf waits for sem3 to be triggered.  On line 5, thread2 calls sempost for sem3.  However, line 8 shows sem3 timing out, but the value of the semaphore is 1.  thread3 then triggers sem1 and waits again 10.  However, because the value is already 1, it wakes straight away.  It doesnt send sem1 again as this has all happened before control is given to thread1, however it then waits again val is now 0 and sem1 wakes up.  This now repeats for ever, sem3 always timing out and showing that the value is 1.p  pSo, my question is why does sem3 timeout, even though the semaphore has been triggered and the value is clearly 1  I would never expect to see line 08 in the output.  If it times out because, say thread 2 has crashed or is taking too long, the value should be 0.  And why does it work fine for 3 or 4 hours first before getting into this statep  pI have tried a similar test using three separate programs, communicating over shared memory, rather than three threads in the same program. This more closely resembles my real world application. The results and the output were the same. The problem does appear to be in the semaphore particularly the semtimedwait call rather than anything to do with pthreads.p  pI have also tried shorter and longer delays, as well as removing the delay completely, with similar results to those described above.  With no delay at all it can sometimes start to produce the error after minutes rather than hours.  This does of course mean that the problem can be reproduced a lot quicker.p  pThis is using Ubuntu 9.4 with kernel 2.6.28.

Negative 1726 pstrongThe Questionstrong What is the best way to calculate inverse distance weighted IDW interpolation in Python, for point locationsp  pstrongSome Backgroundstrong Currently Im using RPy2 to interface with R and its gstat module.  Unfortunately, the gstat module conflicts with arcgisscripting which I got around by running RPy2 based analysis in a separate process.  Even if this issue is resolved in a recentfuture release, and efficiency can be improved, Id still like to remove my dependency on installing R.p  pThe gstat website does provide a stand alone executable, which is easier to package with my python script, but I still hope for a Python solution which doesnt require multiple writes to disk and launching external processes.  The number of calls to the interpolation function, of separate sets of points and values, can approach 20,000 in the processing Im performing.p  pI specifically need to interpolate  for points, so using the IDW function in ArcGIS to generate rasters sounds even worse than using R, in terms of performance.....unless there is a way to efficiently mask out only the points I need. Even with this modification, I wouldnt expect performance to be all that great.  I will look into this option as another alternative. UPDATE  The problem here is you are  tied to the cell size you are using.  If you reduce the cellsize to get better accuracy, processing takes a long time.  You also need to follow up by extracting by points.....over all an ugly method if you want values for specific points.p  pI have looked at the a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipyreferencescipy documentationa, but it doesnt look like there is a straight forward way to calculate IDW.p  pIm thinking of rolling my own implementation, possibly using some of the scipy functionality to locate the closest points and calculate distances.  p  pAm I missing something obvious  Is there a python module I havent seen that does exactly what I want  Is creating my own implementation with the aid of scipy a wise choicep

Negative 1726 pIm trying to subclass UIImageView in order to create an instance of the subclass which plays different animations, depending on a variable I send it.

Ive made sure to change the UIImageView object I placed in Interface Builder into a BubbleAnimation object, so its not that. p  pAny help as to why nothing appears would be very much appreciated. Thanks as always p  pMichael p  pemstrongemememstrongemUPDATEemstrongememememstrongp  pWell, thanks to Kalles advice below, this is all fixed. However, now a similar issue is reoccurring and I wonder what Im doing wrong.p  pBasically, I want to have a small heart that appears in the thought bubble, alongside the animation. Ive added a UIImage to the BubbleAnimation class like sop  precodeinterface BubbleAnimation  UIImageView      UIImage     emotAnim1     UIImage     emotAnim2     UIImage     heart   property nonatomic, retain UIImage heart   voidsetMoodNSString mood  end codepre  pAnd synthesise it in the implementation as usual. Then I set the heart to the correct colour in the setMood methodp  precode voidsetMoodNSString mood      if [mood isEqualToStringkGood]          emotAnim1  [UIImage imageNamedGood1.png]         emotAnim2  [UIImage imageNamedGood2.png]         self.heart  [UIImage imageNamedHeartRed.png]          else if ... codepre  pIn IB, Ive added a hidden UIImageView object and linked it to a UIImageView IBOutlet in my ViewController called bubbleHeart. When the thought bubble appears, I use the following code to display the animations and the heartp  precode    [bubbleAnimation setMoodcharachter.mood] self.bubbleHeart.image  bubbleAnimation.heart         bubbleAnimation.animationDuration  kAnimationDuration         bubbleAnimation.animationRepeatCount  kAnimationRepeatCount         [bubbleAnimation startAnimating]         bubbleHeart.hidden  FALSE codepre  pThe problem is, the animation appears, but the little heart doesnt. Ive tried various approaches  I created the UIImageView in the BubbleAnimation class, instead of using a UIImage, and tried initialising it in various different ways, but no joy. If I call something like codeself.bubbleHeart  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImagebubbleAnimation.heart]code then presumably Im reinitialising the variable so that doesnt work. Any idea why its not appearing p  pMany thanksp  pMichael p

Negative 1726 pIm struggling with realworld use of JPA Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc in a Swing desktop application.p  pJPA seems like a great idea, but relies on lazy loading for efficiency. Lazy loading requires the entity manager exist for the lifetime of the entity beans, and offers no control over what thread is used for loading or any way to do the loading in the background while the EDT gets on with other things. Accessing a property that happens to be lazily loaded on the EDT will block your apps UI on database access, without even the opportunity to set a busy cursor. If the app is running on wifi3G or slow Internet that can make it look like it has crashed.p  pTo avoid lazy loading stalling the EDT I have to work with detached entities. Then, if I actually need the value of a lazy property all my components even those that should supposedly be able to be unaware of the database have to be prepared to handle lazy loading exceptions or use PersistenceUtil to test for property state. They have to dispatch entities back to the database worker thread to be merged and have properties loaded before being detached and returned again.p  pTo make that efficient, my components need to know emin advanceem what properties of a bean will be required.p  pSo, youll see all these shiny tutorials demonstrating how to whip up a simple CRUD app on the NetBeans Platform, Eclipse RCP, Swing App Framework, etc using JPA, but in reality the approaches demonstrated violate basic Swing practices dont block the EDT and are completely nonviable in the real world.p  p More detail in writeup here a hrefhttpsoapyfrogs.blogspot.com201007jpaandhibernateeclipselinkopenjpaetc.htmlhttpsoapyfrogs.blogspot.com201007jpaandhibernateeclipselinkopenjpaetc.htmla p  pThere are some related questions with somewhat helpful responses, but none of them really cover the edt blocking  lazy loading  entity manager lifetime management issues together.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1778578lazyeagerloadingstrategiesinremotingcasesjpahttpstackoverflow.comquestions1778578lazyeagerloadingstrategiesinremotingcasesjpaap  pHow are others solving this Am I barking the wrong tree by trying to use JPA in a desktop app Or are there obvious solutions Im missing How are you avoiding blocking the EDT and keeping your app responsive while using JPA for transparent database accessp

Negative 1726 pHey, I am trying to convert NSString to a C string using cStringUsingEncoding but I have a memory leak. My understanding is that cStringUsingEncoding returns a pointer to a character array that is only guaranteed to exist for the duration of the NSString object. As such you should copy its contents to another string. Heres where my problem lies...p  pI have a function that accepts an NSString and turns it into a Cstring copy. Just for testing I ran 1,000 iterations of the following method to ensure no leaks.p  precode voidtest       NSString test  [[NSString alloc] initWithStringHello world]        forint i0 ilt1000 i                   char tmp  [self returnCopiedCStringtest]             free memory            freetmp               [test release]   codepre  pPretty straight forward code... the problem is that it leaks like crazy. Now before you jump to conclusions my returnCopiedCString function works just fine. I have tested it by declaring and copying a Cstring to rule out the possibility of that being an issue. Inside the function I am using the following code to convert itp  precode char returnCopiedCStringNSString input       retain input       [input retain]        get length of encoded Cstring       int len  [input lengthOfBytesUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]        allocate memory for new Cstring  null terminated byte       char toReturn  char mallocsizeofchar  len 1        copy NSString to Cstring       strcpytoReturn,[input cStringUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]        release input       [input release]        return pointer to newly copied string       return toReturn   codepre  pAlso pretty straight forward. Then I got to thinking well maybe because I declare test outside of the forloop, and thus its never being released, Im leaving all of these const char around from the cStringUsingEncoding method. so I changed the first function to be as followsp  precode voidtest       forint i0 ilt1000 i                   NSString test  [[NSString alloc] initWithStringHello world]             char tmp  [self returnCopiedCStringtest]             free memory            [test release]            freetmp          codepre  pbut still no luck.

Negative 1726 pI have a perfectly good perl subroutine written as part of a perl module. Without going into too many details, it takes a string and a short list as arguments often taken from terminal and spits out a value right now, always a floating point, but this may not always be the case.p  pRight now, the list portion of my argument takes two values, say val1,val2. I save the output of my subroutine for hundreds of different values for val1 and val2 using for loops. Each iteration takes almost a second to completeso completing this entire process takes hours.p  pI recently read of a mystical to me computational tool called threading that apparently can replace for loops with blazing fast execution time. I have been having trouble understanding what these are and do, but I imagine they have something to do with parallel computing and I would like to have my module as optimized as possible for parallel processors.p  pIf I save all the values I would like to pass to val1 as a list, say val1 and the same for val2, how can I use these threads to execute my subroutine for every combination of the elements of val1 and val2 Also, it would be helpful to know how to generalize this procedure to a subroutine that also takes val3, val4, etc.p

My issue is that if I run the same page through django with a rendertoresponse all I get is the processing sign no data. upon debugging it simply says Failed to load resource Cancelled.p  pIts not an issue with not being able to find the source file, Ive also discounted the possibility of an issue resulting from rendering the page and disrupting the fetch process. I must be missing something in datatable setup. its strange that it works on a static page but not on a django rendered page even though it sees the file otherwise it would generate a 404 for that file on debug.p  pAny suggestions would be welcomep  pCheersp  pChrisp  pPS I am new to JQuery and DataTablesp

Negative 1726 pMy team were previously using Qt 4.3 and are trying to update to the latest release 4.7.2.p  pBefore we were using the qsqlite plugin, but this functionality has been moved into the main QSql component of Qt.p  pNow that we have upgraded, were unable to read our old databases. This seems to be because when we created our tables, we created them like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE [Characters] [Id] INTEGER NOT NULL ON CONFLICT ROLLBACK PRIMARY KEY ON CONFLICT ROLLBACK AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE ON CONFLICT ROLLBACK, [ProjectId] INTEGER NOT NULL ON CONFLICT ROLLBACK REFERENCES [Projects]Id ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON INSERT RESTRICT, [CharacterName] VARCHAR128 NOT NULL ON CONFLICT ROLLBACK UNIQUE ON CONFLICT ROLLBACK codepre  pbut codeON INSERT RESTRICTcode is no longer valid.p  pI was able to remove that code and create new tables, but if I do codemyQSqlDatabase.tablescode on one of the existing DBs, it returns zero.p  pI noticed by digging into the Qt code, that the prepare method hasp  precodeif SQLITEVERSIONNUMBER gt 3003011     int res  sqlite3prepare16v2dgtaccess, query.constData, query.size  1  sizeofQChar, ampdgtstmt, 0 else     int res  sqlite3prepare16dgtaccess, query.constData, query.size  1  sizeofQChar, ampdgtstmt, 0 endif codepre  pand we are entering the first if codesqlite3prepare16v2code.p  pShould we be defining SQLITEVERSIONNUMBER somewhere to be lower Is there something else that were doing wrong to prevent backwards compatibilityp  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanks, Lironp

Negative 1726 pI have written code within Python that doesnt release memory the way it should. The memory is taken by Python but never gets released even after not being used anymore. Even if you break the running program with ctrlc. Delete the variable and run gc.collect it doesnt seem to collect. Or the same as in Ipython and running reset. The memory wont be freed and running gc.collect has no effect. I tested this in Windows because I wanted to see if it could possibly be with the garbage collector library. It appears that is the case. Run the code below in Linux and then also in windows. Then compare the memory usage. You will need numpy and scipy installed. Any help or insight on this issue would be much appreciated.p  pImport the Model, create an instance, and then run createSpecific.p  pHere is a code that exhibits this behavior in Ubuntu 10.04p

Negative 1726 pEnvironment Webphere 6, Solaris box, Thick client, Java web app.p  pNumber of request can be between 400  600. On each request to server, I am creating 15 threads using Java ExecutorService for requesting 15 different webservies simultaneously and group all the responses data together and send it back to user. Load test fails at nearly 150  170  users. CPU and memory spikes are seen in DB servicing these webservices and eventually after a very short period of time app server too crashes. Response time of webservice is 1012 sec max and 46 secs min. Connection pooling size of the DB is 40.p  pI am assuming that 150 request are creating 150152250 threads and app server resources are being spiked  and hence crashing.  So I want to use App server threadpool and have threadCount say 100 may not be good number... One thing thats troubling me is, with 100 threads I can process first 6 615  90 requests and 10 calls of 7th request. The next requests have to wait for 1015 secs for getting the threads back and then another 1015 secs for its own webservice call.  Is this approach even goodp  pAnother idea was asynchronous beans provided in Websphere.  Which one suits my requirement.p  pPlease suggest. Calling one webservice after another takes a total of 15lets say 4sec for each request  60 secs which is really bad. So calling webserices together is what I want to do. p

Negative 1726 pApologies for  long post.p  pI have a class called SceneryFile that contains a lot of elements.  The user uses a 2D interface to modify the contents of this class. The results are compiled to a file that is used in a Flight Simulator Application.  User actions can resultin errors where the compile will fail, or warnings where the compile will succeed but the result will not work properly in the simulator.  I want to replicate to some degree programs like ReSharper or Just Code that check the state of the SceneryFile in the background while the user is working and report errors.  I have tried to do this using a Background Worker but the results are not reliable.p  pFirst I created a set of arguments to pass to the background worker that contain the sceneryfile instance and some other stuffp  precodepublic class FSIssueArgs           public FSIssueArgsSceneryFile sceneryFile, Airport airport              Issues  new Dictionaryltstring, FSIssuegt             SceneryFile  sceneryFile             Airport  airport                   public FSIssueSeverity Severity  get set          public Dictionaryltstring, FSIssuegt Issues  get set          public SceneryFile SceneryFile  get private set          public Airport Airport  get private set        codepre  pI am running the background worker each time it finishes.  When a file is loaded I kick off the background worker and then it runs again in the completed eventp  precodeprivate void onIssuesBackgroundWorkerRunWorkerCompletedobject sender, System.ComponentModel.RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e              var args  e.Result as FSIssueArgs              if args  null                  issueStatusLevel.BackColor  args.SceneryFile.IssueStatusFlag                 G.SceneryFile.Issues  args.Issues                           G.IssueHandlerActive  false             check4Issues          codepre  pissueStatusLevel is a button that shows a color based on errors and warnings being present.

I stop the background worker running if the button is clicked and the list dialog is open.p  pI am sure the problem is that I do not understand how objects are passed between the main and background worker threads.   I hoped that the object SceneryFile passed to the bakground thread is a copy and not just a reference.  A method in this file is run to check for errors.  The errors are stored in the file.  I then send the file back as part of the args in e.Result.  I now think that I am doing it wrong and somehow I should not be using the same object in two threads. p  pOf course, while the file is validated in the background the user is modifying it in the foreground.p  pSo  what I want ot do is send a copy of the file to the background thread that is processed but is not a reference to the file in the main thread.  When it has been processed I want to send back a list of issues.  I recognize that the user may have changed the file in the meantime but I am not too concerned and the next run will catch it up.p

Its going quite well actually, but the panel displaying text should be able to position the caret according to the mouse click location. Finding the correct line is easy, because of the Fonts Height property. Finding the current index in that line, however, is not. For nonmonospaced fonts I cant imagine a way to determine the caret index, but for monospaced fonts it should be doable, since the width of a symbol is fixed. So, maybe there is a better way to determine thisp  pKind regards, Jacco p

Negative 1726 pstrongEdit Rolled back Wills change as it was wrongstrongp  pIm experiencing an odd problem with both VS2010 and Blend in design mode. p  pI have a codePivotcode control, with 2 codePivotItemcodes. Usually, when you click in the section of the XAML where the second pivot is declared, VS will update the designer to show that pivot. Additionally, in Blend, usually you can switch between the codePivotItemcodes without any issue. p  pHowever, in my current project, I cant switch between them, in either VS or Blend. Both programs appear to realise Ive clicked though, as an outline of what I assume is the PivotItem is highlighted to the left of the first PivotItem. p  pTo make things more confusing, I created a new PivotApp project, pasted in the code from my current project, and the codePivotItemcode switching worked fine  in both VS and Blend. p  pIve double checked the file properties of my project and the test project e.g. Build Action Page, and they are identical. p  pRestarting VS doesnt help either. It seems to be something to do with the actual project. I have tried removing as much as possible from the XAML page to see if a particular element is causing the problem, but no luck. Ive even tried removing all but the default code in the codebehind file, again with no luck. p  pAnyone know why this might be occuring Seems like a bug to me...p

Make sure you are passing in a GZip stream..p  pThe way Ive implemented it is that everytime an array of byte has to be sent by my framework, I create a new Compression stream wrapper around the existing networkstream, write the bytes to the compression stream, and then flush, close amp dispose it. This to make sure that each WriteMessagebyte[] blah uses its own stateindependent compressionstream that will be flushed immediately. Ive taken care to not let any of the streams close the original network stream.p  precode                using System.IO.Stream outputStream  CreateOutputStreamWrappernetworkStream                                      outputStream.WritemessageBytes, 0, messageBytes.Length                     outputStream.Flush                     outputStream.Close                     outputStream.Dispose                  codepre  pBasicly, my DecompressionStream is created as follows optionals commented outp  precodeprotected System.IO.Stream CreateInputStreamWrapperSystem.IO.Stream inInputStream          return new DeflateStreaminInputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress, true         return new BZip2InputStreaminInputStream, true         return new GZipStreaminInputStream, System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode.Decompress, true  codepre  pand started asp  precodeinputStream.BeginReadbuffer, 0, buffer.Length, new AsyncCallbackReceiveCallback, null codepre  pthen in the ReceiveCallback, the data is read, the stream is flushed, closed and disposedp  precode            Get received bytes count             var bytesRead  inputStream.EndReadar             inputStream.Flush             inputStream.Close             inputStream.Dispose codepre  pand immediately create a new inputStream by calling CreateInputStreamWrapper again.p  pSo whats going on  Since all compressionstream implementations are failing with errors that come down to theres an error in the datastream I have a hunch it must be me and my code. On the other hand, if I remove the compression and just use the networkstream theres no problem, which makes me think the problem must lie with the compressioncode.p  pDoes this sound familiar to anyone  And while were at it, does anyone know of any other compression stream implementations that are suited to wrap around a networkstream p

Negative 1726 pI am trying to create a Delphi grid to allow display and edit in a db grid of data that might have a different data type on each row. I would like to display a specific control for each data type, e.g. when the data type is DateTime, I want to display my custom edit control that allows typing a date in or popping up a calendar.p  pThe data looks something like thisp  precodeName   DataType   DateValue   StringValue   BooleanValue       A      Date       112007  B      String                 asdf C      Boolean                              True codepre  p...and in the db, this table has a column for each possible type of value. So, there is a codeBooleanValuecode column, codeDateValuecode, etc.p  pWhat I would like to do is display a single Value column in the grid that displays the appropriate edit control depending on what the DataType is for that row. So, the grid should look like p  precodeName   DataType   Value       A      Date       112007  B      String     asdf C      Boolean    True codepre  pIt seems I will need to display a different edit control to allow the user to edit the codeValuecode column for each row dynamically based on the value of the codeDataTypecode column. I know there are more advanced grids out there that handle this sort of problem, but the powers that be will not allow anything but what is available outofthebox with Delphi.p  pAny ideas on how to make something like this workp

The log output shows that the numbers 1 and 2 are printed to console before the jwt is printed to the console from the getjwttokenforuser function.p  precodefunction getjwttokenforuserthekey      var JwtTokenURL  getjwttoken     var theusername  username.val     var theuseremail  useremail.val     var theusernumber  usernumber.val     .ajax          type Get,         url JwtTokenURL,         data usernumber  theusernumber, username  theusername, useremail  theuseremail, thedkey  thekey,         async false,         success functionresult              var myObject  JSON.parseresult             console.logmyObject.jwttoken             return myObject.jwttoken         ,         failure functionfail alertfail          function purchasethekey      console.log1     var jwttoken  getjwttokenforuserthekey     console.log2     if jwttoken                console.logjwttoken         goog.payments.inapp.buy             parameters ,             jwt      jwttoken,             success  successHandler,             failure  failureHandler                  codepre  pAny idea what I can do to ensure that the ajax request has returned the data before the purchase function marches on without the jwt valuep

I will need to execute remote scripts on a number of Window ServersComputers while we are building them. p  pI have a web application that is going to automate this task, I currently have my prototype working to use PsExec to execute remote scripts. This requires PsExec to be installed on the system. A colleague suggested I should use WMI for this.p  pI did some research in WMI and I couldnt find what Im looking for. I want to either upload the script to the server and execute it and read the results, or already have the script on the server and execute it and read the results. I would prefer the first option thoughp  pWhich is more ideal, PsExec or WMIp  pFor reference, this is my prototype PsExec code.

Negative 1726 pVisual C newbie here.  I came up to speed on Visual C 6 somewhat ages ago, and have used the IDE sporadically since then, but still dont feel comfortable with it.  Give me a good old commandline and get off my lawn, thats my attitude.p  pIm helping out on an app built with Visual C 2010 its a solution file with 20 subprojects, and noticed something odd even though ITERATORDEBUGLEVEL and SECURESCL are both defined to zero in the projects properties, adding FAs for one of the .cpp files still shows calls to checked iterator stuff, e.g.p  precode   call    DWORD PTR impOrphanallContainerbase0stdQAEXXZ codepre  pIve verified with printf that both defines are zero.   Furthermore, these calls seem very fragile if I delete seemingly trivial amounts of code from the function involved, the calls to Orphanall vanish.p  pSo why is Visual C 2010 still calling Orphanall when a vector is destroyed with ITERATORDEBUGLEVEL0  Also, Ive also heard that the cl.exe itself in windows sdk v7.1 and several games all seem to import OrphanallContainerbase0stdQAEXXZ from msvcp100.dll, which seems odd for released products.  What should msvcp100.dlls OrphanallContainerbase0stdQAEXXZ do  is it a noop, or does it actually do things, like the one in msvcp100d.dllp

Negative 1726 pI have written a custom build script for my android app. I included some easy preprocessing, so I can define comments likep  precodeifdef something ... CODE endif codepre  pand get rid of the Code part if configured so. The Problem is, that after preprocessing I dont need some modules anymore, so I leave them out. What remains is the import statement for that module which bites me, if I want to build the app finally. Im searching for a way within my preprocessing, to organize the java Imports inside my script after preprocessing happens. Any Solution without the need for additional clicks is very welcome.p

Negative 1726 pIm making a webapp, here I load images from the web and show them. Im using KineticJS.

I get the error Uncaught TypeError Cannot call method setImage of undefinedp  pWhen I look in my debugger, the this in the function is that image object, and not my card... This is not what I expected, neither what I need. How do I fix thatp  pSo what it has to do is, first make a Kinetic Image with my loadingImage. Then when the actual image is loaded, change the image to that new image.p  pThanks Pablop
Negative 1726 pHeres the situation.p  pWhat I am working with    ASP.NET MVC 4 Web API   IIS 7.0 to host application   C p  pI have Web API that gets performance data from remote machines on an intranet and am testing calling the API via URL calls, and this returns JSON. However, it must complete execution first before returning the JSON. So for example, if I return performance monitoring for 10 seconds, I will have to wait 10 seconds before having all the data values displayed.p  pWhat I want to do is get it live, so that it will return a value when it reads the performance counter each second and display it in JSON, rather than waiting for everything to be retrieved and then list it all at once. I am attempting to use the YIELD keyword in order to accomplish this, but it still isnt working. The JSON is not displayed in the browser until the method has completely finished.p  pHere is the code for the repository method and for the coordinating controller actionp  pFrom LogDBRepository.cs p

Negative 1726 pNewbie question about JavaFX that I havent been able to answer, despite knowing it must be pretty simple to do and not finding any resources on it anywhere Ive looked tutorials, many of the Oracle online docs, articles, the wellknown JavaFX bloggers, etc.p  pIm developing a command line script running application and I have successfully gotten output via ProcessBuilder from the script that I can display in an ongoing manner, as things happen on the command line.  That is, I can do codeSystem.out.printlnlinecode all day long, showing the output in the console, which simply returns output from an input stream returned by the myProcess thats running, created like thisp  precodeBufferedReader bri  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReadermyProcess.getInputStream codepre  pSo I am able to see all the output coming back from the script.p  pId like to setup a JavaFX TextArea or ScrollPane or, not sure what, to display this output text theres a lot of it, like several thousand lines as an ongoing progress of whats taking place in the script, as it happens.  I have a Scene, I have buttons and get input from this scene to start the script running, but now Id like to show the result of clicking the button RUN THIS SCRIPT, so to speak.p  pI assume I need to create a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenecontrolTextArea.html relnofollowTextArea as described herea or perhaps a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenecontrolTextAreaBuilder.html relnofollowTextBuildera would be useful to begin making it.  Not sure.p  pI need a bit of help in how to setup the binding or autoscrollautoupdate part of this.p  pCan someone provide me a place to start, to do this with JavaFX  Id rather not use Swing.p  pIm using JavaFX 2.2, JDK 1.7u7, all the latest stuff, and yes, this is an FXML appso doing it that way would be preferred.p  pUPDATE Sergey Grinevs answer was very helpful in the binding part.  But here is some more detail on what I mean when I ask for a bit of help in how to setup  basically, I need to return control to the main Scene to allow the user to Cancel the script, or to otherwise monitor whats going on.  So Id like to spawn the process that runs that script that is, have some kind of free running process, but still get the output from it.  I wasnt very clear on that in my initial question.p  pThe technique Im using here see below is to do a waitFor on the process, but of course this means the dialogScene is hung while the script executes.  Id like to gain control back, but how do I pass the p Process to some other controller piece or alternatively, simply kick off that other process passing in the parameters to start the script and have it start the script that will then do the autoupdate, via the binding Sergey Grinev mentionswithout hanging the Scenewindow  Also Can I then stop this other process if the user requests itp  pHere is my current code waits while scriptwhich takes 2040 min to runcompletes this is emnotem what I want, Id like control returned to the userp  precodepublic class MyController implements Initializable      FXML   private void handleRunScriptActionEvent event throws IOException       ProcessBuilder pb  new ProcessBuildermyscript.sh, arg1, arg2, ...

Negative 1726 pSo heres the situationp  pI have an abstract superclass model for a raytracer program, from which various kind of geometry inherit properties and functions. There will be no objects of type model, obviously, but there will be an array of type model in which the entire geometry of the scene will be stored.p  pThen a number of Rays will be cast by the raytracer. Each ray will iterate through this array of models and check if it collides with them using its own method, Rayintersect. Thus, Rays declaration includes approximately thisp  precodePoint intersectSphere sphere ...  Point intersectCube cube ...  Point intersectTorus torus ... codepre  petcp  pProblem is, since all of these classes inherit from Model, and the array is of type model, the elements will be of type model when they are accessed. There is no intersect for model, so I wont get a wrongmethod error so much as a nosuchmethod error. So the issue is how can I cast each member to its appropriate typep  pIs there a reasonable way to do this, or must I try casting each subclass explicitly for each object, and using whatever sticks This seems very hackish for what seems like a common problem.p

Negative 1726 pI am working on a simple hash table in C. I have methods to insert, delete, and search the hash table for the specified key. I know that the C map STL container can handle my situation, but I would kind of like to code my own as an educational exercise. p  pBasically I have a hash table that will take a single string and map it to a vector of other strings. This is easy to do in a method because calling a .Add or .Delete will behave as expected. I would however like to create an overloaded [] operator to the class that is able to do these operations on the vector. p  pFor example, if I want to add an item to the vector I can write something like this p  pre      hashTable[string1]  newString pre  pThis will set the new string as a member of my vector. The same can be said for delete and search. p  pre     hashTable[string1]       cout ltlt hashTable[string1] ltlt endl pre  pMy major problem is that I do not know how to overload the code[]code operator to gain this functionality.

Negative 1726 pI would like to change the ugly default looking of gvs GUI.

Later on I figured out the relevant resource might bep  precodeGV.control.MButton.unsetFrameStyle sunkenraisedledged codepre  pThe 3 options sunken, raised, ledged do change the style of the frame. But I cannot find an option that makes the frame a simple line or just disappear.p  pSeems gv is based on Xaw3d I am not sure. I dont know whether these resources are provided by Xlib, Xt, Xaw or just by gv itself. It is unlikely that they are gv specific. If they are provided by Xlib, Xt or Xaw, I could change lookings of similar x window programs the same way once I found the right resources and options to set.p  pSo my question would be how to find the right x resources and options to remove borders of an x widget p  pPS editres provides only the resource list but not the options list. appres and listres show a very short list of resource settings if I use them for gv.p

Negative 1726 pI have a setup in which two nodes are going to be communicating a lot. On Node A, there are going to be thousands of processes, which are meant to access services on Node B. There is going to be a massive load of requests and responses across the two nodes. The two Nodes, will be running on two different servers, each on its own hardware server.brbrp  pI have 3 Options HTTP1.1 , rpccall4 and Directly sending a message to a registered genserver on Node B. Let me explain each option.brbr bHTTP1.1bBRBR Suppose that on Node A, i have an HTTP Client like codeIbrowsecode, and on Node B, i have a web server like codeYaws1.95code, the web server being able to handle unlimited connections, the operating system settings tweaked to allow yaws to handle all connections. And then make my processes on Node A to communicate using HTTP. In this case each method call, would mean a single HTTP request and a reply. I believe there is an overhead here, but we are evaluating options here. The erlang Built in mechanism called codewebtoolcode, may be built for this kind of purpose. brbr brpccall4bbrbr I could simply make direct rpc calls from Node A to Node B. I am not very susre how the underlying rpc mechanism works , but i think that when two erlang nodes connect via codenetadmping1code, the created connection is not closed but all rpc calls use this pipe to transmit requests and pass responses. Please correct me on this one.brbrbSending a Message from Node A to Node B bbrbr I could make my processes on Node A to just send message to a registered process, or a group of processes on Node B. This too seems a clean option. brbr bQ1.b Which of the above options would you recommend and why, for an application in which two erlang nodes are going to have enormous communications between them all the time. Imagine a messaging system, in which two erlang nodes are the routers  brbr bQ2.b Which of the above methods is cleaner, less problematic and is more fault tolerant i mean here that, the method should NOT have single point of failure, that could lead to all processes on Node A blind  brbrbQ3.b The mechanism of your choice how would you make it even more fault tolerant, or redundant brbr bAssumptions b The Nodes are always alive and will never go down, the network connection between the nodes will always be available and noncongested dedicated to the two nodes only , the operating system have allocated maximum resources to these two nodes.brbr Thank you for your evaluationsp

Negative 1726 pI recently tried debugging a small program by printing the values of several pointers to the console. The first was the memory address a struct, and the others were the memory addresses of its fields. A strippeddown version of the code is as followsp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  struct testingPointers      int i     float f     double d  test  int main     stdcout ltlt amptest ltlt n ltlt amptest.i ltlt n ltlt              amptest.f ltlt n ltlt amptest.d  codepre  pAnd the output isp  precode0x681110 0x681110 0x681114 0x681118 codepre  pobviously the exact values are different for different runs but they always have the same positions relative to each other.p  pI am confused because the value of first pointerthe memory location of codetestcodeis the same as that of the second one the first field of codetestcode. Does this mean that objects have no real unique memory address, and that a pointer to a struct or class simply points to its first field If so, how do statements like p  precodea.b agtb a.b codepre  pmake sense if codeacode is actually just its first field, and therefore does not have any fields or methodsp

Negative 1726 pLooking for a solution to an issue caused by large data sets forcing Ember to lock up the browser while it tries to process the data.p  pFor pagination, Im using tchaks handy a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1559628 relnofollowpagination mixina to paginate approximately  13,000 objects being loaded from a backend API.p  pThe Ember Data objects contain an ID, one text attribute and several number attributes.p  pThe problem is it takes close to a minute before the browser finishes processing the data, rendering the browser unusable in the meantime. Firefox even goes as far as to issue a warning that a script is using up all browser resources and suggests that script be terminated. p  pIve written my own pagination mixin that requests objects by range, i.e. items 1025, and it works generally well except for one serious limitation sorting. To sort the data, I need to make additional requests to the backend and reload the objects even if some of them have already been loaded.p  pI would love to be able to load all of the content upfront to simplify the process of sorting without doing additional requests to the backend API. Im looking for guidance on how to tackle this issue but Im open to an entirely alternative approach.p  pIf nothing else, is it possible to reduce the resource footprint Ember places on the browser as it tries to load all 13k objects into the ArrayControllerp  hr  pIm using Ember 1.0.0pre2 with the latest Ember Data currently at Revision 10.p  pOn the backend is Rails 3.2.8.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong I sidestepped the issue by loading data into an ArrayController property other than codecontentcode. This brought the load times down from over a minute to only a few seconds. I then slice the requested number of items and load those into content. This works well for any number of items, at the cost of not being able to easily sort the data.p

Negative 1726 pFor the project Im currently working, I am creating resource files .resx.  I am using Resgen.exe and AL.exe to create .resource and .dll files.  The Build Action for the code.resxcode files is set to None.p  pThe idea is to allow customers to provide their own localization if what we provide does not suit their needs.p  pThe problem Im having is that the .resource files are absolutely necessary in the delivered product.  I was under the impression that the .resources.dll file be sufficient.  Are the .resource files really needed in the finished product or am I doing something wrongp  pEDIT  I have recently discovered that helper files were specifically looking for .resource files.  I have modified the code to use the .dll, but now strings are not being returned.  So now my question is how do I access the .resources.dll to retrieve the stringsp

Negative 1726 pBR    I have a question regarding file IO C language and its performance issues.p  pI have an application that does a lot of file IO over its lifetime 36hours, about 0.50.75TB, of mostly file output. At the moment my application codesprintfcodes everything into a char string and at the end of a line codewritecodes, to a filedescriptor. My string is 1024 characters in length, but can vary anywhere from 64 to 1024. At any rate. p  pstrongThe question isstrong BR Would it make more sense to make a larger char string say, 1MB and codesprintfcode everything into it before doing the codewritecode Or does it make more sense to skip codesprintfcode completely and simply codewritecode directly to the file, assuming the buffering is taken care of by codewritecodep  pSomething I thought of, but unsure if itll actually accomplish anything in terms of performance BR What if I had a structure where I store the individual parts of the string, numbers and strings and do a memcopy of the structure instead Im guessing similar to a binary writep  pIm trying to achieve a buffered approach or anything that will maximize performance. The later is that I need to use that file for further processing.

Negative 1726 pIm wondering if there could be any problems while accessing one array with multiple threads but either only reading or only writing.p  pWhen the threads write to the array it wouldnt matter in which order they write and even if they write to the same entry all threads would write the same value.p  pFor example, if I want to find prime numbers via the Sieve of Eratosthenes I create an array of consecutive numbers and set all multiples of prime numbers to 0 using multiple threads.p  pIt wouldnt matter if the thread which strikes off the multiples of two and the thread which strikes off the multiples of 5 set the entry of the number 20 to 0 at the same time or one before or after the other.p  pSo its not an question of the qualitiy or consistency of the data, but of the technical possibility to do it wihout facing any java errors.p

The problem is getting the injected mailsender into the right state that needs it. Some states might not need it and others might need something else. Because the states are not created by the container they can not use injection themselves. Passing injected fields in the constructor of a state is a possibility but then the injected object might get stale inside the unmanaged statep  pI resorted to sending it as an argument in the method call, that way it should always be fresh. Very cumbersome if many injections needs to be sent as arguments and feels wrong in some way.p  pHow would you propose how to handle the injected resources needed by the state objects in this example p  pPlease disregard any threading issues in the class.p

If it helps the Java layer is using Xstream.p  pHere is a chunk of XML that is being sent from Javap  precodeltConfigurationMapgt     ltmapConfig classhashtablegt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey1ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue1ltstringgt       ltentrygt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey2ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue2ltstringgt       ltentrygt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey3ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue3ltstringgt       ltentrygt       ltentrygt         ltstringgtKey4ltstringgt         ltstringgtValue4ltstringgt       ltentrygt     ltmapConfiggt ltConfigurationMapgt codepre  pThanks, please let me know if you need more information.

I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1952638singleassemblymultilanguagewindowsformsdeploymentilmergeandsatelliteathis very promising questiona and gave it a shot.p  pAfter adopting the class in the suggested solution, I replaced all occurences I could find of ResourceManager with SingleAssemblyResourceManager in the .Designer.cs files using a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsfartit relnofollowFARTa in a prebuild commandp  precodefart.exe ProjectDir.Designer.cs System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManager codepre  pThen I created a batch file like sop  precodeProgramFilesILRepack.exe texe out1TempProg.exe 12.exe 1es2.resources.dll  IF ERRORLEVEL NEQ 0 GOTO END  ProgramFilesILRepack.exe texe out1TempProg2.exe 1TempProg.exe 1de2.resources.dll IF ERRORLEVEL NEQ 0 GOTO END  ProgramFilesILRepack.exe texe out1SA2.exe 1TempProg2.exe 1tr2.resources.dll  IF ERRORLEVEL NEQ 0 GOTO END  del 12.exe  del 12.pdb  del 1TempProg.exe del 1TempProg.pdb del 1TempProg2.exe  del 1TempProg2.pdb  rmdir 1es S Q  rmdir 1de S Q  rmdir 1tr S Q   END  codepre  pAnd called it from a postbuild commandp  precodeProjectDirpostbuild.bat TargetDir TargetName codepre  pemNote TargetName and ProjectName are the same in this case.emp  pBuilt it, successfully, but its not working as expected... The form should be displayed in the InstalledUICulture language if available. To accomplish this, I added this line before InitializeComponentp  precodeThread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  CultureInfo.InstalledUICulture codepre  pWhich did the trick in the standard version of the program. Not anymore. However I also added a little control to change the language at runtime, via a ComboBox. Code is as followsp  precodeprivate void comboBox1SelectedIndexChangedobject sender, EventArgs e    if comboBox1.SelectedItem.ToString  English Default            Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfoen       ChangeLanguageen        else if comboBox1.SelectedItem.ToString  Espaol            Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfoes       ChangeLanguagees          else if comboBox1.SelectedItem.ToString  Deutsch            Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfode       ChangeLanguagede          else if comboBox1.SelectedItem.ToString  Turkce            Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfotr       ChangeLanguagetr        private void ChangeLanguagestring lang    foreach Control c in this.Controls        SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManager resources  new SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManagertypeofForm1     resources.ApplyResourcesc, c.Name, new CultureInfolang     if c.ToString.StartsWithSystem.Windows.Forms.GroupBox            foreach Control child in c.Controls                  SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManager resourceschild  new SingleAssemblyComponentResourceManagertypeofForm1           resourceschild.ApplyResourceschild, child.Name, new CultureInfolang                 codepre  pAnd this strongdoesstrong change the form language. So the dlls are actually included in the exe. Why then, does InitializeComponent not load the appropriate resources I checked the Designer code and the ResourceManager had been replaced by SingleAssemblyResourceManager.p  pAlso, other than the form buttons texts I have a strings.resx file per language, for MessageBoxes and whatnot, and that doesnt seem to work either way. But that might be another question.p  pI am aware that the original solution was designed for a NET 2.0 environment, and that the ResourceSets are obsolete, but it is my understanding that it emshouldem work, even if its not recommended. p  pAny pointers as to where I should look into would be awesome.p
Negative 1726 pMy team and I are building a SaaS product which is to be used by multiple businesses across the world. To put it simply, our software does some basic accounting for them and alerts them if some document is due for renewal.p  pThe problem is, there may be just 3 such documents for each such company in India but 4 in Sri Lanka and 7 in Singapore. And each field may be named differently. For example, the three fields may be called Drivers License, Insurance, Permit in India but they may be called XYZ,XXYZ and XZY in Singapore.p  pWhat is the best and most effective way to implement such features using MySQL. Lets say I can cap the number of such columns at 5. Also, I do not want to use NoSQL for this project.p  pWere using PHP running on CodeIgniter and we plan to deploy on Engineyard.p
Negative 1726 pI have several files in my application folder. I want older versions to be replaced with newer ones, except 1 file x. I want x to be replaced ALWAYS regardless of versions.

However, I think it is probably a better fairer approach at least in the setting of the example.

Further, the lecturer has rated the required skillset for every project.

Negative 1726 pI develop a shopping app. Im using web service for getting items. I call web service function in asynctask and I get items successfully. But I added login page and when user logged in, user navigate to items page, then asynctask cant get result. On debugging asynctask works, but when run the app normally asynctask doesnt work. If I select category on spinner, asynctask works. I think, its about calling asynctask on spinner selected items but I dont know how to fix it.p  pAgain, on debugging program works as expected, but when I run the app normally asynctask cant get items. I have to select category in spinner for works as expected.p  pLogin Pagep  precodepublic class LoginUser extends AsyncTaskltString,String,Stringgt          private ProgressDialog dialog  new

Negative 1726 pMy goal is not to hack Yii in a totally different direction and it seems by following what I learned about inheritance and normalization that is not possible.

Negative 1726 pMy question looks at first sight similar to others notably a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions572893cloninganonstandardsvnrepositorywithgitsvnCloning a NonStandard Svn Repository with GitSvna  but I have one additional problem. I am also aware of a hrefhttpjohn.albin.netgitgitsvnmigrate relnofollowhttpjohn.albin.netgitgitsvnmigratea .p  pSome of the branches that were created in the svn repository left out the toplevel directory in the trunk. So in the branch, all files appear to differ from the files in the trunk, merely because they are in a different location.p  pExample in one of the branches, the directory codetrunktopsrccode corresponds to codebranchesfoobarsrccode instead of the more usual codebranchesfoobartopsrccode. But there are also branches that use the second form.p  pNow when running codegit svn clonecode on this svn repository, it will retrace the full history of such branches and double all commits to them. On the trunk the commit will be for file codetopsrcfilecode and on the branch it will be for codesrcfilecode. Because the codegit svn fetchcode operation apparently isnt clever enough to detect this relocation, it will go back the full history prior to the creation of the branch and create new commits for the new location, going back all the way to the beginning of time, just so that it can create the files that are going into the branch.p  pSince there are a lot of branches, and the later ones have a lot of history, this is annoying situation, since each commit is doubled or tripled although from a cursory inspection it seems that the alternate location of each file is shared for somebutnotall prehistory of the branches that it later is going to occur in. And it really adds to the conversion time, too.p  pNow what Ive been thinking about to fix that is the following. What if it were possible to insert some hook in the code of codegit svn fetchcode it is a Perl script that would edit the paths of the files involved after it fetches them from svn, but before it commits them to git. If the pathname of a file would not contain the codetopcode directory, it would insert it, otherwise it would leave the name alone. This way I effectively rewrite history as we go along.p  pNow the following questions spring to mindp  ol liIs this a sane ideali liIf yes, how can I do itli liIf no, what else could I do The origin repository is still in use, so solutions that make it impossible or difficult to import future commits are unfortunately not helpful.li ol  pIn addition to this, I will start in a nonempty destination repository and skip the first part of the svn history. This is because the beginning was converted from cvs, where its tags from that time were converted in a rather strange and useless way, and I have already created a script to redo that part from scratch.p

We are now considering creating an app for Windows 8 Store app probably in JavaScriptHTML5 as we dont have developers with wpfxaml expereince but have some great developers with wealth of experience in these JavaScriptCSS etc. We would like to us some of our existing code libraries that are written in C, VB.NET, C. So far what I have read is that existing .NET libraries could not be called directly from a Windows 8 Store app and will require to create Windows 8 component. Is this correct Can we creating these reusable components using JavaScript If some one can provide recommendation on useful links with sample that will be great. p

Negative 1726 pI need to perform a convolution using a Gaussian, however the width of the Gaussian needs to change. Im not doing traditional signal processing but instead I need to take my perfect Probability Density Function PDF and smear it, based on the resolution of my equipment. p  pFor instance, suppose my PDF starts out as a spikedeltafunction. Ill model this as a very narrow Gaussian. After being run through my equipment, it will be smeared out according to some Gaussian resolution. I can calculate this using the scipy.signal convolution functions. p  precode    import numpy as np     import matplotlib.pylab as plt      import scipy.signal as signal     import scipy.stats as stats       Create the initial function. I model a spike      as an arbitrarily narrow Gaussian     mu  1.0  Centroid     sig0.001  Width     originalpdf  stats.normmu,sig      x  np.linspace0.0,2.0,1000      y  originalpdf.pdfx     plt.plotx,y,labeloriginal        Create the smearing function to convolve with the      original function.      I use a Gaussian, centered at 0.0 no bias and      width of 0.5     muconv  0.0  Centroid     sigmaconv  0.5  Width     convolvingterm  stats.normmuconv,sigmaconv      xconv  np.linspace5,5,1000     yconv  convolvingterm.pdfxconv      convolvedpdf  signal.convolveyy.sum,yconv,modesame      plt.plotx,convolvedpdf,labelconvolved     plt.ylim0,1.2maxconvolvedpdf     plt.legend     plt.show codepre  pThis all works no problem. But now suppose my original PDF is not a spike, but some broader function. For example, a Gaussian with sigma1.0. And now suppose my resolution actually emvarysem over x at x0.5, the smearing function is a Gaussian with sigmaconv0.5, but at x1.5, the smearing function is a Gaussian with sigmaconv1.5. And suppose I know the functional form of the xdependence of my smearing Gaussian. Naively, I thought I would change the line above top  precode    convolvingterm  stats.normmuconv,lambda x 0.2x  0.1 codepre  pBut that doesnt work, because the norm function expects a value for the width, not a function. In some sense, I need my convolving function to be a 2D array, where I have a different smearing Gaussian for each point in my original PDF, which remains a 1D array. p  pSo is there a way to do this with functions emalreadyem defined in Python I have some code to do this that I wrote myself....but I want to make sure Ive not just reinvented the wheel. p  pThanks in advancep  pMattp

It imports classes like codeCardscode, codePlayerscode, codeContainerscode, etc.p  pI also have a game specific server class that is a subclass of codeGenericServercode, lets call this one codeMagicServercode.p  pWhat Id like to do is have the codeMagicServercode load game specific versions of the classes imported by codeGenericServercode.p  precodeclass GenericServerobject      imports Cardsobject, Playersobject, Containersobject  class MagicServerGenericServer      imports MagicCardsCards, MagicPlayersPlayers, MagicContainersContainers codepre  pThe plan is to have multiple game specific servers all as subclasses of codeGenericServercode but also with their own versions of codeCardscode, codePlayerscode, codeContainerscode etc. Ive considered just breaking the servers up individually, but since they share so much of the same code I would like to subclass them from codeGenericServercode.p  pAny suggestions on how to work this outp

Negative 1726 pI have already built REST based APIs in codeigniter framework for one of the app.  The app lists all the businesses registered with the company ABC.p  pNow I am developing website for the same company ABC. I need to show the businesses registered with ABC in the website home page as well. And when a customer clicks on one of the business, it will show them all the details of the business. p  pEx. A coffee shop is the registered business. When a customer clicks on the coffee shop it will show what they offer and where they are located etc etc. p  pThe same details are also shown on native android and IOS app. p  pMy question here is Should I use the same controllerwhich holds business logic that is used for requesting and showing details of coffee shop on mobile devices or build another controller for showing the same details on website. p  pIs it a good practise to use the same controller for both mobile and web p  pFuture There are plans for developing mobile web based application as well probably using phonegap or something. The current website will be responsive as well.p  pMy understanding of having same controller for both mobile and website 1 Single controller for both mobile and website means one change and it reflects in all devices or platforms.p  pAny other advantages or disadvantages and also few best practises that say use same controller or API for both or use different for web and mobile.p  pPlease let me know if the question needs to be elaborated.

Negative 1726 pIm in the process of setting up VagrantPuppet for a project at work. We use a hrefhttpgetcomposer.org relnofollowComposera to manage all of our dependencies. One project has a dependancy that we created thats stored on a private GitHub repository.p  pIve got everything else set up with Vagrant amp Puppet. It installs the proper version of PHP, downloads and installs Composer, and attempts to run Composer. I say attempts, because the composer install step never works  we have to use vagrant ssh to get into the machine after its provisioned and run composer install ourselves.p  pIve got SSH agent forwarding turned on in the Vagrantfile.p  pIs there something special I need to do to have Puppet run as a user that has access to the SSH key required to clone the GitHub repository Id rather not have Vagrant copy the key into the VM  or mount a specific directory  because that might not work across all host OSes  we do have a few people who develop on a Windows machine, and .ssh wont work there  I think . p  pAny thoughts on how I can resolve this issuep

Thus, in the following custom inclusion tag,p  precodedirextras.py register.inclusiontagappnamemodeldata.html def fielddatafield     datalist  Attributes.objects.valueslistfield, flatTrue         return datalistdatalist codepre  pi am returning a list of field objects for the model class Attributes. The template that renders the tag is the followingp  precodemodeldata.html  load dirextras  lttablegt   for data in datalist      lttrgt         lttdgt data lttdgt     lttrgt  endfor  lttablegt codepre  pAnd the template where I run my fielddata tag and display all Attributes data is the followingp  precodelist.html lttablegt lttrgt      for field in fields          ltthgt field.verbosename ltthgt      endfor      lttrgt        lttrgt          for fname in fieldnames                  lttdgt  fielddata fname  lttdgt          endfor          lttrgt     lttablegt codepre  pAlthough all of the table columns are aligned, still the format of the rows is inconsistent. So, the elements of the rows are not aligned with each other but instead the first element is spanning so much that is aligned with the elements of other 5 rows.   p  pa hrefhttpimageshack.usaimg8027295pbtu.png relnofollowlist.html template imageap  pIs the formatting changed due to the inclusion tag or is it another issue and is there a way to fix itp
Negative 1726 pI cant wrap my head around the eclipse target definition. p  pFrom the wiki a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgPDETargetDefinitions relnofollowThe Target Platform is a critical part of developing using PDE. It defines what your workspace will be built and launched against.ap  pWhen building a Java application I understand that the CLASSPATH has to contain all the imported packages.

Negative 1726 pIm running SQL server management studio and my tabledataset contains approximately 700K rows. The table is a list of accounts each month. So at the begining of each month, a snapshot is taken of all the accounts and who owns them, etc. etc. etc. and that is used to update the dataset. The 2 fields in question are AccountID and Rep and I guess you could say month. This query really should be pretty easy but TBH, I have to moveon to other things so I thought Id throw it up here to get some help.p  pEssentially, I need to extract distinct AccountIDs that at some point changed reps. See a screenshot below of what Im thinkingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc87I3.png altenter image description herep  pThoughtsp  p I should note for instance that AccountID ABC1159 is not included in the results bc it appears only once and is never handled by any other rep.p  p Also, another parameter is if the first time an account appears and the rep name appears in a certain list and then moves to another rep, thats fine. For instance, if the first instance of a Rep was say Friendly Account Manager or Support Specialist and then moves to another name, those can be excluded from the result field. So we essentially need a where statement or something that eliminates those results if the first instance appears in this list, then there is an instance where the name changed but non after that. The goal is to see if after the rep received a human rep so they didnt have a name in that list, did they then change human reps at a certain point in time.p

Negative 1726 pI am starting a new project and trying to decide how to organize the code in Bitbucket.  I work at a startup where all of us have technical experience, but none of us have worked at software development companies.  We have been arguing about the best way to organize our code in our bitbucket repositoryies.  p  pWe have some PHP code for the front end of our website, and some Matlab for the backend the Matlab is being complied to work with the PHP, but I dont think that is relevant.  The PHP code is used exclusively for the website, but the Matlab is worked on by many developers making changes, some relevant to the website and some not.p  pWe have come up with three schemes for how to organize the codep  pScheme 1 Put the Matlab and PHP in the same repository.  Branch the Matlab into Website a.k.a. stable main branch, Develop1, Develop2, etc.  The developers work on their own branch, and periodically we merge the Develop branches into the Website branch.p  pScheme 2 Put the Matlab and PHP in the same repository.  Developers who want to work on the Matlab fork the Matlab into other repositories, then submit pull requests when they want their code merged with the website Matlab code.p  pScheme 3 Put the PHP in one repository and the Matlab in another.  Then the developers fork or branch as described above.p  pWhat are your thoughts  The DBA in our company says that it is a terrible idea to put two types of code in the same repository and at some point, it would be three, since we will be slowing changing the Matlab code over to C or some other language.  On the other hand, I worry that it will be hard to keep track of which versions worked with each other for the PHP and Matlab if they are in separate repositories.p  pI read a number of posts on stack overflow that partially answered my questionsp  pThis helped me understand the difference between branches and forks  it would appear to me that branches simply require more trust in the developers, since they can merge without permission or code review.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3329943gitbranchforkfetchmergerebaseandclonewhatarethedifferencesgit branch, fork, fetch, merge, rebase and clone, what are the differencesap  pThis seems very close to my question, although when I showed it to the DBA, he said it isnt a good example since Java and Javascript are so similar.  However, the answer written here seems to point to my Scheme 1.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5127910howtoorganizesharedcodeassetsacrossprojectswithgitrepositoriesHow to organize shared codeassets across projects with git repositoriesap  pThis also helped me understand branches and git in general better.p  pa hrefhttptom.prestonwerner.com20090519thegitparable.htmlhttptom.prestonwerner.com20090519thegitparable.htmlap  pThis answer also seems to suggest that even code that that doesnt share any files should be in the same repository if it is part of the same project.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6818350shouldiseparateclientandserversideofmyprojectintotwogitrepositoriesShould I separate client and server side of my project into two Git repositories, or keep them in oneap

Negative 1726 pThe code works fine when I close the client just after sending one instruction.

We are using iScroll V4.2, and unfortunately cannot risk upgrading to a more recent version.p  pHeres the problem We are using an input field then triggering click to this input field to trigger the iOS Take Photo, Choose Existing popupp  precodeltinput typefile capturecamera acceptimagegt codepre  pFrom what Ive read and seen in testing. When you click the button iOS seems to use the target location of the last element clicked and then puts this popup above that location. p  pIt seems when we call this inside iScroll the target location is never set and it uses the location of the last element outside iScroll for the popup location.p  pI have a possible solution of creating my own popup and triggering this input fields Click event from inside there which might cause the location to show up there. But this really isnt a simple solution and Id rather just set whatever target location iOS is using.p

Negative 1726 pI have a dataframe df1 that has 3000 columns. Each columns corresponds to a stock ticker. I export in a DataFrame df2 using codepd.readcsvcode a csv file of 500 stock tickers 1 column and 500 rows, excluding the index. How can I extract into a new datafame from df1 the 500 columns that match the stock tickers in df2 p  pI can write a loop that iterates over each row in df2 and extract one column at a time from df1 but I find this slow and probably not the most efficient way.  p
Negative 1726 pI am recently reading about Node.js and got an interesting statement about JavaScript and Internet Explorerp  blockquote   pInternet Explorer doesnt actually support JavaScript or ECMAScript it supports a language variety called JScript. In recent years, JScript has fully supported the ECMAScript 3 standard and has some ECMAScript 5 support. However, JScript also implements proprietary extensions in the same way that Mozilla JavaScript does and has features that ECMAScript does not.p      pSource a hrefhttpchimera.labs.oreilly.combooks1234000001808ch01.htmlchap2id35941400 relnofollowhttpchimera.labs.oreilly.combooks1234000001808ch01.htmlchap2id35941400ap blockquote  pFrankly speaking I am totally unable to understand the above statement. I know Microsoft has its own codeVBScriptcode and it allowed JavaScript in IE that is why JS is more popular than any other scripting language. Is this statement true If yes then the scripting engine of IE does the translations of native JavaScript to JScript or what is the other casep

Negative 1726 pI have built an application in emHTML5em and I use emJQuery Ajaxem for manipulating the data to sql server database.p  pFor this application I use emwcfem service for getting and posting that data through stored procedures.p  pOn browserchrome everything works fine, even if the server is overloaded the ajax will wait for response from the server.p  pI wrapped this app on IPad with xCode, and I noticed that the Ajax works with different behavior. If the server is overloaded, and for example some procedure executes for instance 1 minute, ajax will not wait for the true response of that proceduremethod from the wcf service, it goes in error immediately.p  pI try to use code.donecode instead of code.successcode, and it doesnt help me, I also try to set codetimeout6000060seccode on the ajax and still nothing, so I dont know how to solve this.p

Negative 1726 pIm working on creating a custom UI cursor.  The cursor position is determined by checking some input values every 5ms and adjusting the style.top and style.left properties on a DOM element.  Usually this works very smoothly, however I find that the cursor sometimes hangs.  Im not exactly sure whats causing this but it appears to be related to requests returning slowly in WinJS.xhr calls.p  pIs there a better way to update my cursor UI that will keep it running smoothly  Can I use another thread for thisp
Negative 1726 pI was able to configure SSL for .pl to serve my appengine app over https.p  pMy application always require https.

For example if text input is null, select value is  and checkbox not checked in the above example, value jo, a, hi shoule be red.  So far I could achieve this through following codep  precoderegisterForm.validate      errorPlacement function           return false     ,      submitHandler function form           var errors0         var name  input[namecustomername].val          var td  purchaseselected.ischecked          ifname              input[namecustomername].csscolor,red              errors         else              input[namecustomername].csscolor,white                    code for purchaseselected omitted         iferrors0             submit         codepre  pBut it drives me crazy about the select fields. I cant make the text red when a is selected. The best solution came out is that I set .error and .valid css style and  use the keyword required in the select tag. But it doesnt make the text red but only the border. Further more, it seems the required validates first and if its through, then comes to the submitHandler which makes it poor user experience.p  pAny advice would be appreciated. p  pAnd I am wondering if I could use something likep  precoderules     customername         required true     ,     addressprovince         required true     ,     purchaseselected         required true        codepre  pI tried it out, but nothing happened. And even so, I dont really know how to make the text red when they are invalid.p

Negative 1726 pI would like to know what the preferred function to put in a code string immediately after a user selects a selection box control of a record so that his selection is acknowleged and included as true.   In short, I have a form where the user uses a selection box to indicate which records to select and then executes a command where I have code that should copy and paste the records he selected.  Unfortunately, the last record selected, upon running executing the copypaste command is not recognised.   I understand that I probably need to add a function such as  goto the next record however I am not sure if this is the best way or if there is a more standard way that programmers use to not lose the last record selected.

Negative 1726 pThis program should use fork to create processes, store the PID of the child process into a singly linked list, after fork fails kill the processes one at a time, then free the nodes in the linked list, and finally print out how many processes were created before ending the program.p  pCurrently it does not do these things and I am not sure where to go with it. It will compile correctly, but when I run it in the Minix terminal that I have to use it does nothing. When I go to shutdown the terminal, I end up getting shutdown cant fork Resource temporarily unavailable. So something is going wrong and any help would be appreciated. Thank you.p  precode    Problem Write a complete Cprogram to determine the number of    simultaneous processes Minix can support for a single user. Be    aware that a users login shell is itself a process. Once this has    been determined, any processes created will have to be terminated.

Each child process will    call pause. The signal will be delivered by the parent process using    kill system call. When fork fails, terminate the children processes    one at a time using childs PID and SIGKILL signal. You will have to    keep track of children process PIDs in a singly linked list.

Negative 1726 pWhen trying to migrate from TFS 2010 to Visual Studio Online we are getting the error Template Customization or Template Mismatch error.

A few people here suggested applying an uncustomized template to the projects in TFS but its not clear which templates should be applied.p  pWe have a project that uses the CMMI template but there are three versions of this on the TFS server  4.0, 4.2 and 5.0. I dont see any way to tell which one was used to create the project. As a matter of fact the only reason I know its CMMI is it errored when I created a project in Visual Studio Online with the Agile template and tried to migrate to that.p  pTo add to the confusion, VSO only has templates with version 2013.3 so the project Im migrating to uses the CMMI 2013.3 template. Should I add the older templates to Visual Studio Online and create my project using the same templatep  pWhich template should I apply to the project to make it able to migrate Should it be one of these or should I use the 2013.3 templatep  pLastly, how do I get a copy of the uncustomized templates Do I need to create a new project and export itp  pThanks, Billp

Negative 1726 h2Scenarioh2  pI have a need to cache the results of database queries in my web service. There about 30 tables queried during the cycle of a service call. I am confident data in a certain date range will be accessed frequently by the service, and I would like to precache that data. This would mean caching around 800,000 rows at application startup, the data is readonly. The data does not need to be dynamically refreshed, this is reference data. The cache cant be loaded on each service call, theres simply too much data for that. Data outside of this frequently used window is not time critical and can be lazy loaded. Most queries would return 1 row, and none of the tables have a parentchild relationship to each other, though there will be a few joins. There is no need for dynamic sql support.p  h2Optionsh2  pI intended to use myBatis, but there isnt a good method to warm up the cache. myBatis cant understand that the service query codeselect  from table where key  code is already covered by the startup precache query codeselect  from tablecode. p  pAs far as I understand it documentation overload, Hibernate has the same problem. Additionally, these tables were designed with composite keys and no primary key, which is an extra hassle for Hibernate.p  h2Questionh2  pPreferred Is there a myBatis solution for this problem  Id very much like to use it. Familiarity, simplicity, performance, funny name, etcp  pAlternatively Is there an ORM or DBfriendly cache that offers what Im looking for  p

Negative 1726 pI have a multivariable function that I wish to minimize. The function has two input arguments, a vector c and a scalar theta.p  pUsing fmincon in MATLAB to solve the optimization problem for both c and theta is complicated because certain values of theta causes numerical errors. However, fixing theta, c can be easily obtained via fmincon without any errors.p  pSo the plan now is to do a brute force approach, i.e. compute c for each value of theta in the range 1100 although the true constraint for theta is theta ge 0 and choose theta and the corresponding c for which the objective value is minimized simply by plugging the estimated parameters back to the objective function.p  pNow this doesnt sound very efficient to me and Im wondering if I can employ a bisection methodesque approach so that I would not have to go over all possible values of theta in the range specified above.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 1726 pI have a generic algorithm in which an array whose size is known in advance must be filled in emreverseem from the highest index to the lowest.  If the array werent being filled in reverse, the most efficient way to do this would be calling codereserveCapacitycode and then codeappendcodeing the values.  In other words,p  precodevar arr  [T] arr.reserveCapacityminimumCapacity knownCapacity  append values using algorithm codepre  pHowever, that will add the first value produced by the algorithm at index code0code.  I need it to start at index codeknownCapacity  1code and work backwards.p  pHow could this be accomplished in Swift  Of course I can add values starting from code0code and then reverse the array, but reversal is an expensive operation.  Ideally, there would be some sort of codereserveBackwardsCapacitycode and codeprependcode system of methods, or a data structure built specifically for this built into the language, but I havent been able to find either.p  pI would use code[T]count knownCapacity, repeatedValue code and just fill from the back, but because the algorithm is generic it should work for any type codeTcode I dont have any way of knowing what to put for coderepeatedValuecode and filling the array with values just to be overridden would be expensive and unnecessary.p

Negative 1726 pThis is something I havent done before and want to know what the proper methodology should bep  pIf you had a trivial object such asp  precodestruct simpleobject      int i  codepre  pAnd in your application you created an array of these objects of the form p  precodesimpleobject array  new simpleobject[10] codepre  pI know that the default behaviour of c is to allocate the array and call the default constructor of this class on each object, and similarly the destructor will be called on each for codedelete [] arraycode.p  pThe question comes up when you want to increase the size of the array. For instance if you wanted to double the size of the array you might do something likep  precodesimpleobject temp  new simpleobject[20] memcpytemp, array, sizeof simpleobject  10 delete [] array array  temp codepre  pBut I think this is dangerous and probably wont even work anyway there would probably be some conflicts in a destructor of a more complicated object. Another option would bep  precodesimpleobject temp  new simpleobject[20] for i to 10     temp[i]  array[i]  delete [] array array  temp codepre  pThat way every element in the array is default constructed and the copy constructor for each object is called directly. Is this the proper way to copy arrays of objects or are there other more standard ways to do itp  pI know that the standard option would be to use a vector and utilize its resizing capabilities but instead of the boilerplate answer Id like to better understand what the proper operation for copying arrays of objects should bep

Negative 1726 pI have a codeJButtoncode that has an overridden codeactionPerformedeventcode function as the followingp  precodepublic void actionPerformedActionEvent event      try          System.out.printlnenters here         Process p  Runtime.getRuntime.execpython tetris.py      catch Exception ex          System.err.printlnerror       codepre  pThe problem with this code is that the Python subprocess begins while Java program is being executed and hence the console for the subprocess, which is meant to display as a full screen, is shrunk to a smaller size. So I decided to terminate the Java program before executing its subsequent processp  precodepublic void actionPerformedActionEvent event      try          System.out.printlnenters here         Process p  Runtime.getRuntime.execpython tetris.py         System.exit0      catch Exception ex          System.err.printlnerror       codepre  pThis presented a newer problem  although the subsequent process does appear as a full screen, because the Java program terminates before tetris.py gets fully executed, there is a delay between two processes, resulting the desktop content to blink for a second before tetris.py begins to run. At this point, I used codewaitForcodep  precodepublic void actionPerformedActionEvent event      try          System.out.printlnenters here         Process p  Runtime.getRuntime.execpython tetris.py         p.waitFor         System.exit0      catch Exception ex          System.err.printlnerror       codepre  pAs it turns out, codewaitForcode waits for the subprocess to terminate, which has the same problem from the first scenario in that the subprocess console is shrunk in size. p  pMy goal is one of the followingp  ol lipEither find a way for the subprocess to execute in fullscreen mode it does this on its own.pli lipThe parent process Java program can terminate if the subprocess executes correctly, but I need to get rid of the delay between the two processes.pli ol  pI prefer the option of terminating the Java program because when I switch back from its subprocess to its own process with JPanel, the positions of all JButtons are messed up and hence requires a new execution anyways. Any inputs would be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWhat laune suggested didnt exactly work, as codeProcessBuildercode seemed to take effect as soon as the codeJButtoncode is clicked, but I got an idea from there. Instead of checking the status of the subprocess, I just put the Java process to sleep for a certain duration experimental value that lies somewhere between the points where Python program executing in a smaller window and Java program terminating too early to produce a prolonged delay.p  precodepublic void actionPerformedActionEvent event      try          ProcessBuilder pb  new ProcessBuilderpython, tetris.py         Process p  pb.start         Thread.sleep300           less than 315  320 transition         System.exit0      catch Exception ex          System.err.printlnerror       codepre  pNo matter what value I used, however, I could not make the transition happen flawlessly and the desktop content blinks briefly but the delay is shorter than before. To counteract this even further, I was thinking of setting the desktop black to make it seem nothing was being shown, but this obviously is not an idle approach  it depends on the performance of the processor and hence has a poor portability, not to mention that this does not provide a real solution to the problem. Any further pointers would be appreciated.p

Negative 1726 pI have a bunch of commits to master that I would like to flatten into one big commit in order to reduce the repository size.  I would like to do this using TortoiseGit.  I havent been able to find any examples that I could understand using Tortoise...p  pAlso, doing this kind of thing is supposed to be a nono for stuff that has been shared.  Im going to do this on something that I have pushed to a remote, however, I am the only one that has been doing anything with the remote and havent created any branches over the history that I am trying to flatten.  I assume this will not cause me any problems.p

Negative 1726 pI thought this would have been a question already asked many times, but I cant find it.p  pWe are developing applications and have multiple shared assemblies which are used by multiple targets. When Im creating a new application Ill probably use such a assembly eg Framework and reference it in my project. All fine here. However, when this Framework assembly uses for example the Model assembly, Im not forced by Visual Studio to reference it. As long as my code doesnt touch any Model types, it will compile fine without a reference.p  pAt runtime, it does require the Model assembly. When strongreleasingstrong this application there is no problem, as I just include all the required references in my installer project.p  pThe problem arrizes when I try to strongdebugstrong the application. The bin folder wont have the Model assembly as its not referenced.p  pstrongThe questionstrongbr Is there a best practice to solve this reference of a reference situationp  pstrongSolutions weve come up withstrong  p  pemAdd the Model as a referenceembr This feels wrong, we pollute the projectp  pemInclude the Model project in the solution and add as project referenceembr This feels even worse polluting the solutionp  pemAdd postbuild stepembr Could be a solution, but doesnt feel that right either.p

Negative 1726 pIm building a store app using Windows Runtime in WP 8.1. I have a problem in my solution structure, the Data layer and the App itself are in different projects therefore in different assemblies as well. The only common point between the socalled back end and the front end is a shared assembly, where are the interfaces for the repository classes, the entities and so on.p  pIm using the Microsoft Composition for DI and It works well If the CompositionHost needs to look into just one assembly the assembly of the app itself but If I want to import some types which are imported in an another assembly or assemblies the system tells me that no exports found for the types.p  pThis kind of situation can be handled in WPF or even SL because of the codeGetExecutingAssemblycode method but in WinRT, just the following code works codeCompositionHost  new ContainerConfiguration.WithAssembliesassemblies.CreateContainercode I know the fluent interface has a codeWithAssembliesIEnumerableltAssemblygt assembliescode method but still I do not know how I reach the exports which are made in different assemblies.p  pThank you for your help in advancep

Negative 1726 pI have a rather large solution revolving around a WebAPI project. I ran into some performance issues on a particular web service, and used the builtin performance profiler in VS2013 to find the bottlenecks and deal with them. Eventually I got the response time on a HTTP request down from around 500ms to 50ms I use an external app to perform repeated requests and log the roundtrip time.p  pHowever, I only see this improvement while running the WebAPI from the performance profiler tool. As soon as I switch back to running it straight from Visual Studio F5 or on our test server, the response times increase to around 400ms, still an improvement on the original 500, but not exactly magnificent.p  pIt only makes a slight difference if I run it in debug mode or release mode. Setting debug info to none rather than the default pdbonly, on all the involved projects helps a tiny bit, bringing the average response time down to around 350ms.p  pI cant for the life of me, figure out what the performance profiler tool does to optimize the code further. And its killing me that Ive seen how fast it can run, but Im unable to achieve the same performance.p

Negative 1726 pI am trying to embed the octave library within a larger program. It is required that I can start and stop the octave interpreter at will from this larger program. However, the only function to stop the octave interpreter cleanly also calls exit, which kills the larger program also. The octave library function is cleanupandexit. p  pIdeally I would like to call just the cleanup part dooctaveatexit, and skip the call to exit.p  pI tried the followingp  p1 calling dooctaveatexit, however the symbol is not exported in the octave library. I Tried to access it anyway but to no avail.p  p2 I tried hooking into the call to exit, and replacing it with a function that does not exit, via ldpreload. This messed up everything as all other calls to exit were hooked also.p  p3 I tried to detect when exit was being called by octave only to prevent it only then, by detecting the calling function with a call to backtrace. This for some reason did not show what i would expect to be the true call hierarchy. For some reason it only showed the main function, and no contents of the call hierarchy through the octave library. So in was not able to detect the call coming from octave.p  pThe Code I am using to call the octave functions looks likep  precode  Octave Setup Functions  extern C void octinit const char  path    stringvector argv 2   argv0  embedded   argv1  q    octavemain 2, argv.cstrvec , 1   ifstrlenpath gt 1      octaddpathpath      extern C void octexit void    printfExiting   cleanupandexit 1,1  codepre  pThe key function here is cleanupandexit  which is implemented in the octave source asp  precodevoid cleanupandexit int retval, bool safetoreturn    dooctaveatexit     if octavelinkexit retval        if safetoreturn       return     else              gnulibsleep 86400          else      if octaveexit      octaveexit retval    codepre  pSo the above code calls the function I want dooctaveatexit but then proceeds to call octaveexit  which is a function pointer to exit.p  pIdeally I want to either a prevent this call to exit, or b trap the call when it comes from octave only and prevent it, and allow it when it comes from other sources. I have not been able to do a or b so farp  pSo at this point I am out of ideas. I could recompile octave, but this solution is supposed to work with a stock octave install.p  pThis only had to work on a linuxgcc environment.p  pAny and all suggestions to this very tricky issue greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1726 pMy problem started when I began using the codeISerializationCallbackRecievercode to create a codeSerializable Dictionarycode in Unity, It worked fine for most of my classes but when I nested 2 codeSerializable Dictionariescode I started getting trouble with Enumeration.p  pI believe it was during codeOnBeforeSerializecode where the dictionary had trouble adding codeKeyValue Pairscode after a certain count, I solved this by defining a dictionary property and used it to access the data in my keys and lists, so to be a bit clearer, I was working on a codeCustom Inspectorcode which had to variations of keys, so I thought using a codeSerializable Dictionarycode would work best since I have more than a hundred variations, what my object does is it collects data from my assets and divides that data depending on the key I gave it.p  pthe code for my Scriptable Objectp  precode[System.Serializable] public class LetterDataObject  ScriptableObject      [SerializeField]     public DictionaryOfLettersData lettersData      [SerializeField]     public bool isText  false      [SerializeField]     public bool [] folds   [System.Serializable] public class LetterData      [SerializeField]     public string letterText     [SerializeField]     public Sprite letterSprite     [SerializeField]     public AudioClip letterAudio   [System.Serializable] public class LetterDataDictionary  SerializableDictltint, LetterDatagt     [System.Serializable] public class DictionaryOfLettersData  SerializableDictltint, LetterDataDictionarygt    codepre  pAs you can see every data type is codeSerializablecode, I believe my problem is the dictionary is getting modified during codeOnBeforeSerializecode probably since am accessing a codeSerializable Dictionarycode of another object, so to solve this I used a dictionary property.p  precode[Serializable] public class SerializableDictltTKey, TValuegt  DictionaryltTKey, TValuegt, ISerializationCallbackReceiver       [SerializeField, HideInInspector]     private ListltTKeygt keys  new ListltTKeygt     [SerializeField, HideInInspector]     private ListltTValuegt values  new ListltTValuegt       public DictionaryltTKey, TValuegt serializedDictionary               get         private set           public void OnBeforeSerialize               foreach var item in serializedDictionary                              if keys.Containsitem.Key                     keys.Additem.Key                  if values.Containsitem.Value                     values.Additem.Value                        public void OnAfterDeserialize              serializedDictionary  new DictionaryltTKey, TValuegt             for var i  0 i lt keys.Count i                              serializedDictionary[keys[i]]  values[i]                    codepre  pThis might not be a problem since it is solved now but am curious if someone could give a hint on what is going on  Maybe there is something I did not know about with unitys serialization so I would love it if anyone faced the same problem and could help me understand it further, I can not move on without understanding my little hack.p
Negative 1726 pI am trying to implement an AccessibilityService that records the users actions only click events at this point and stores them, such that they can be replayed at a later point in time.p  pFor this I register for codeAccessibilityEvent.TYPEVIEWCLICKEDcode events and check if I could somehow recover them later on when all I have is a reference to the window  root node of the activity by using two strategiesp  ol liGet the clicked views id and look for this id in the root nodes treeli liGet the clicked views text and look for this text in the root nodes treeli ol  pI have tested this in various applications and different parts of the Android system and the results have been very confusing. About half of the views were not recoverable by any of the two strategies, and some views were sometimes reported as being recoverable and sometimes not. I found out that the latter was due to a race condition, since the accessibility service runs in a different process than the application to which the clicked views belong.p  pMy question now is whether there is a better way to get a handle to a view in an accessibility and find this view again in a later execution of the application.p  pBelow you find the code of my AccessiblityService classp  precodepublic class RecorderService extends AccessibilityService       private static final String TAG  RecorderService      Override     public void onAccessibilityEventAccessibilityEvent event           switch event.getEventType          case AccessibilityEvent.TYPEVIEWCLICKED             AccessibilityNodeInfo node  event.getSource              if node  null                  Log.iTAG, node is null                 return                           AccessibilityNodeInfo root  getRootInActiveWindow             if root  null                  Log.iTAG, root is null                 return                            Strategy 1 locate node via its id             String id  node.getViewIdResourceName             if id  null                  Log.iTAG, id is null              else                   ListltAccessibilityNodeInfogt rootNodes  root.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewIdid                 if rootNodes.size  1                      Log.iTAG, success via id                     return                  else                      Log.iTAG, multiple nodes with that id                                             Strategy 2 locate node via its text             CharSequence text  node.getText             if text  null                  Log.iTAG, text is null              else                  ListltAccessibilityNodeInfogt rootNodes  root.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByTexttext.toString                 if rootNodes.size  1                      Log.iTAG, success via text                     return                                            Log.iTAG, failed, node was not recoverable                    Override     protected boolean onKeyEventKeyEvent event          Log.iKey, event.getKeyCode            return true          return super.onKeyEventevent           Override     public void onInterrupt        codepre  pI am developing this on SDK Version 21 Lollipop and testing it on a HTC Nexus M8 and a Samsung Galaxy Note2, both showing similar results.p

Negative 1726 pI am building an app that uses the fancybox gem. I have added localisation and have added the ability for the user to select the language setting from a drop down menu.

Negative 1726 pOkay so heres the problem. Im replacing html content with the jquery function replace.with. Some parts of the HTML contains an imageslider from the library a hrefhttpresponsiveslides.com relnofollowhttpresponsiveslides.coma except the Jquery that makes the slide functional doesnt fire after the content is replaced. On the initial page it works fine then after I replace the content it stops working. However i did get it working with adding a click event on the page with the replaced content.p  precodedocument.onclick, .title, function slider3.responsiveSlides   auto true,   speed 500,        codepre  pso above code works fine, how ever I want it to fire when the content is replaced. Not when the user clicks on a button on the new page. I also tried thisp  precodedocument.onclick,title1, function GoToFusion slider3.responsiveSlides auto true, speed 500,   codepre  pAnd I also tried putting the folowing code in the HTML that is replacing the old HTML hoping it would just fire after the page loaded...p  precodeltscriptgt function          slider3.responsiveSlides     auto true,     pager false,     nav true,     speed 500,     namespace largebtns         ltscriptgt codepre  pAlso I dont think theres anything wrong with the HTML or CSS, because the slider works fine with the click event.

Negative 1726 pI am using a webservice through an action in a field to retrieve some aditional data as well as validate the user input. The validation is done by storing in a instance the validation status and make the input field to check that the code is not present to be valid. This works correctly as long as I dont try to use a repeated grid. When a repeated grid is used the same instance is used for all the repeated fields. The webservice data is loaded correctly independendtly, but the validation is shared between all of them.

Many thanks.p  pMy code is below, and its also in this a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditq3lUmsVgmL3yNXNGhw8Tppreview relnofollowplunkera.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltstylegt      body        margin 0           container        position relative       overflow hidden           map         width100         height100           .layer        position absolute           .tile        pointerevents none       position absolute       width 256px       height 256px           ltstylegt     ltbodygt     ltscript srchttpd3js.orgd3.v3.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srchttpd3js.orgd3.geo.tile.v0.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltdiv idcanvasgt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltg idmapgt                 ltdiv classlayergtltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltscriptgt      var width  Math.max960, window.innerWidth,         height  Math.max500, window.innerHeight,         prefix  prefixMatch[webkit, ms, Moz, O]      var tile  d3.geo.tile         .size[width, height]      var sf  [122.417, 37.775],             belowsf  [122.510962, 37.580284],         ny  [74.0064, 40.7142],             brooklyn  [73.975536, 40.691674]      var projection  d3.geo.mercator             .scale200000             .translate[width  2, height  2]  just temporary      var zoom  d3.behavior.zoom      var canvas  d3.selectcanvas             .stylewidth, width  px             .styleheight, height  px      var container  d3.selectcontainer         .stylewidth, width  px         .styleheight, height  px      canvas                      .callzoomTony,200300.event                         .transition                         .duration20000                         .eachjump      var map  d3.selectmap      var layer  d3.select.layer              function zoomTolocation, newscale                return zoom                     .scalenewscale  2  Math.PI                     .translateprojectionlocation.mapfunctionx  return x                            function jump                var t  d3.selectthis               function repeat                  t  t.transition                     .callzoomTosf, 200000.event                   .transition                     .callzoomTobelowsf, 200000.event                     .eachend, repeat                                  zoomed      function zoomed        var tiles  tile           .scalezoom.scale           .translatezoom.translate                   projection           .scalezoom.scale  2  Math.PI           .translatezoom.translate        var image  layer           .styleprefix  transform, matrix3dtiles.scale, tiles.translate         .selectAll.tile           .datatiles, functiond  return d         image.exit           .remove        image.enter.appendimg           .attrclass, tile           .attrsrc, functiond  return http  [a, b, c][Math.random  3  0]  .basemaps.cartocdn.comlightall  d[2]    d[0]    d[1]  .png            .styleleft, functiond  return d[0] ltlt 8  px            .styletop, functiond  return d[1] ltlt 8  px             function matrix3dscale, translate        var k  scale  256, r  scale  1  Number  Math.round       return matrix3d  [k, 0, 0, 0, 0, k, 0, 0, 0, 0, k, 0, rtranslate[0]  scale, rtranslate[1]  scale, 0, 1 ]             function prefixMatchp        var i  1, n  p.length, s  document.body.style       while i lt n if p[i]  Transform in s return   p[i].toLowerCase         return            function formatLocationp, k        var format  d3.format.

Negative 1726 pPerforming FFT with matlab on the Green function, I get a strange result that I cant explain.p  pWith the definition of Green function codeGr14pircode and taking codeG01code to avoid divergence, I am doing two different samplings, one defined on the interval code[1281127]code and the other on code[01255]code.p  pFor plotting, I am using codefftshiftcode Matlab function.

Negative 1726 pIve recently started an online course in C, and am working through the second question in PS1. The question requires us to request an input of change from a user in dollars, and to calculate the smallest number of coins you can give them that change with, provided you are only allowed 25 cent, 10 cent, 5 cent and 1 cent coins. p  pFor example 50 cents would be 2 25 cent coins, and 65cents would be 2 25cent coins, 1 10 cent coin and 1 5 cent coin. p  pHere is my codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltcs50.hgt    int mainvoid      float change  0     int coinCounter  0     int remainder  0     int remainder1  0     int remainder2  0     int remainder3  0  do      printfPlease enter the change in dollars      change  GetFloat  whilechange lt 0  converts amount in dollars to cents change  change100  We want to use the largest number of big cois as possible to make up the change.  This calculates the remainder if any after dividing the change by 25.   modulo, only works with integer operands. remainder  intchange  25  change  remainder gets us the largest number divisible by 25. This line then calculates   the maximum number of 25cent coins we can use, and sets this number equal to the coinCounter. coinCounter  intchange  remainder25  Finds the remainder if any when dividing the last remainder by 10. remainder1  remainder  10  remainder  remainder1 gets us the largest number divisible by 10. Dividing this by 10, we  determine the max amount of 10 cent coins we can use to make up the required change. We then add   this number of coins to the total coinCounter. coinCounter  coinCounter  remainder  remainder110  Again, take the remainder if any from the last calculation, and find the remainder when dividing by 5. remainder2  remainder1  5   remainder1  remainder25 tells us the number of 5 cent coins we need to make up the required change.   We add the number of coins to the coin counter. coinCounter  coinCounter  remainder1  remainder25  Finds the remainder when dividing last remainder by 1. There will actually be no remainder, so remainder 3 will  equal zero.  remainder3  remainder2  1  Here, remainder2  remainder11 Finds the number of 1 cent coins required to make up the left change.  remainder3 will always be zero. Hence remainder21 will always be equal to remainder 2. We add this number  of 1 cent coins to the coinCounter. coinCounter  coinCounter  remainder2  remainder31  We print out coinCounter, which is the smallest number of coins required to make up the change. printfin,coinCounter      codepre  pNow I am new to programming, so I am very aware that there are probably far more efficient ways of tackling this problem. However, this seems to work fairly well. However, strangely, I get an incorrect result when I try 4.2. I should get 18 coins 16 25 cent coins and 2 10 cent coins, however the program displays 22. It works well for all other numbers I have tried however.p  pI cannot figure out what I have done wrong. I feel like it either has something to do with where I change dollars to cents by multiplying by 100, OR, where I calculate the modulo and cast change to an int, but I unfortunately cannot figure it out alone.p  pI have heavily annotated my code so it is somewhat easier to understand. I hope someone can help me with thisp  pRegards.p
Negative 1726 pI am currently working on a strategy game and I want to preform actions using GUI.Button on game objects. I am using ray cast and mouse click to select the object however when I click on GUI.Button to take out another action the button disappears. I want to use that button to open up another GUI.Box to show some descriptions.p  pI know why the button is disappearing, it is because I am projecting the ray cast to my button clicks in the update function but how can I avoid this I also know that I have to use EventTrigger however I am not familiar with javascript event trigger, I searched online but I couldnt find any helpful javascript.p  pScreenshotsp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comAs1BG.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAs1BG.png altenter image description hereap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comBJlPg.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBJlPg.png altenter image description hereap  pHere is my scriptp  precode  HideInInspector   var isCalledint  0   HideInInspector   var scWidthint  0   HideInInspector   var scHeightint  0   function Start         scWidth  Screen.width       scHeight  Screen.height               function Update     if Input.GetMouseButtonDown0             var ray  Ray  Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay Input.mousePosition            var hit  RaycastHit            if Physics.Raycast ray, hit                 if hit.collider.tag  House                 isCalled  1                else                isCalled  0                                            function OnGUI   ifisCalled1   GUI.ButtonRectscWidth2,scHeight2scHeight4,120,120, name    codepre

Now I want to reuse the same kernel module, for an additional number of LEDs, however I cannot load the module with insmod for additional LEDs with a different command line parameter, since an error is thrownp  pError could not insert module  File exists.p  pI know this is telling me that I cannot load the same module twice, but what is the best approach when trying to provide LKMs for multiple devices  p  pThe only solution I can think of is to rewrite a LKM for each individual LEDdevice which hardly seems efficient, or pack all of the LEDs in one LKM which isnt very scalableportable.p  pDoes anyone have any comments on the best approach. Thanks in advance.p

SFActivity, does the login, gets some data which is passed to Launcher, I dont know why but it doesnt store anything, launches GameActivity through an intent and from there on the game crashes because of the lack of data.p  h2Launcher.Javah2  precodepublic class Launcher extends Application  public ArrayListltStringgt oppNames  new ArrayListltgt private static Launcher singleInstance  null public static Launcher getInstance      return singleInstance  Override public void onCreate      super.onCreate     singleInstance  this     SalesforceSDKManager.initNativegetApplicationContext, new KeyImpl, SFActivity.class    codepre  pActivity.java GameActivityp  precodepublic class Activity extends BaseGameActivity   public static BoundCamera camera public static Activity thisActivity public ListltStringgt ActivityOppObjects  new ArrayListltStringgt ResourcesManager resourcesManager  ................... public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     thisActivity  this     ActivityOppObjects.addAlll.oppNames   ........................ codepre  h2SFActivity.javah2  precodepublic class SFActivity extends SalesforceActivity    private static final SFActivity INSTANCE  new SFActivity Launcher l  Launcher.getInstance public Activity a  Activity.thisActivity RestClient.AsyncRequestCallback requestCallback   new RestClient.AsyncRequestCallback      Override     public void onSuccessRestRequest request, RestResponse result          try              oppNames.clear             JSONArray records  result.asJSONObject.getJSONArrayrecords             for int i  0 i lt records.length i                  oppNames.addrecords.getJSONObjecti.getStringName                l.oppNames.addrecords.getJSONObjecti.getStringName                 Debug.dTest,l.oppNames.geti.toString                          runGame                   catch Exception e              onErrore                     Override     public void onErrorException exception          Debug.eexception       public RestClient client   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState  private void runGame       if l.oppNames  null          Intent intent  new Intentthis, Activity.class         Bundle bundle  new Bundle         bundle.putStringArrayListnull, l.oppNames         intent.putExtrasbundle         startActivityintent         public void onFetchOpp throws UnsupportedEncodingException      sendRequestSELECT Name FROM Opportunity    private void sendRequestString soql throws UnsupportedEncodingException      RestRequest restRequest  RestRequest.getRequestForQuerygetStringR.string.apiversion, soql      client.sendAsyncrestRequest, requestCallback    Override public void onResumeRestClient client      this.client  client      RestClient.ClientInfo ci  this.client.getClientInfo     Toast.makeTextthis, Hello   ci.accountName, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show     try          onFetchOpp      catch UnsupportedEncodingException e          e.printStackTrace         codepre
