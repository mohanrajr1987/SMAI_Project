Positive 46457 pI have the following issue. I would like to know how I can assign rows containing information of different columns the data in the columns is in different classes  factor, integer, logical to a data frame without some of the fields being indexed, but to get the value of them.  Now when I assign it to the data frame some of the columns contain the values that I need in char format, while the others are just indexes referring to values. p  precodedata[i,2ncoldata] lt listing[listingID  subsetID[agrepmatchstring, subsetStreet, max.distance  3], ] codepre

The output could also be 3 columns, with the first column just being the 9 names, and then a pointsum column and salarysum column.p  pI see a semi solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26495000fantasyfootballlinearprogramminginrwithrglpkherea.  Im not familiar with the Rglpk package used there but it looks like that will just generate the 1 lineup that maximizes points, but I want to be able to look at not just the best lineup but also the next 100 or so that have very comparable totals for the pointsum.p  pYesterday I tried to just do it with one dataframe of all the players, and have it generate all the combos, at which point I would then start filtering out the illegal lineups 2 QBs, etc but R said there were too many combos so it couldnt do it.  I guess 2509 is pretty huge.p  pAfter that error message I started trying to sort of cheat and have it generate just all the combinations of 3 WR, then all the combinations of 2 RB, and was going to have it generate the lineups using those chunks of players, but it just seems like there should be a more elegant and pure solution.p

Positive 46457 pSo, I have created a list and a single column matrix that contains 256 nested lists. What I would like to do, is to convert each of the 256 lists into a single dataframe of 16 columns and then codewrite.tablecode it. Although each list contains the same number of columns 16, the number of rows for each list varies. I have tried to use codeunlistcode unsuccessfully because the changing row counts. I can subset each list individually, so I know theres an easier way to do the whole list.p  pIm pretty new to R, so I apologize for asking what may be a naive novice question.

Positive 46457 pI am currently trying to analyze different strategies for a processing method.

Positive 46457 pI am having a very strange issue with R. Some actions produce NA records in a dataframe that arent real NAs  they dont have a row in the original dataset, the row ID says something strange like NA.123 instead of a real row number, and they match a test of 1.p  pIts hard to describe what is happening, so Ill let heavilycommented code do most of the talking. The data file referenced here is a small 187 K publiclyavailable file from the NHANES 2005 datasets, available at a hrefhttpwwwn.cdc.govNchsNhanes20052006COTD.XPT relnofollowhttpwwwn.cdc.govNchsNhanes20052006COTD.XPTa if anyone wants it so they can try to replicate the problem.p  pI am creating a yesno variable to assess whether a cotinine blood test was positive or negative, using a cutoff of 10 to define a positive test. In the code below I do this two different ways, creating cotpos1 and cotpos2 to illustrate some of what I have found when troubleshooting this issue.p  pFor the purpose of this post, a good NA is something that should be NA because the original blood test results were missing, and a bad NA is one of the mystery rows that wasnt part of the original data, every value is NA including the SEQN, which isnt missing for any row in the original data, the row number shows up as something like NA.123, and the NAs in each column match 1.p  pThis dataset uses a field called SEQN to identify every record. At the start, no records are without a SEQN, so when the bad NAs appear later and their SEQNs are NA too as well as everything else in the row this suggests to me that rows are being added.p  pThere are other ways I can do this that dont produce bad NAs, like using ifelse or using a package that does recodes, so my question isnt about how to make this work  its Why do the methods used in the code below produce the strange NA.123 rowsp  precodelibraryforeign  To open SAS xpt files   Read in the data files testdata lt read.xportCOTD.xpt   cotpos1, everything set to 0 or 1   testdatacotpos1[testdataLBXCOT gt 10] lt 1  Positive cotinine test testdatacotpos1[testdataLBXCOT lt 10] lt 0  Negative cotinine test  testdatacotpos1[testdatacotpos11]  We have NAs that match 1 testdata[testdatacotpos11,cSEQN,cotpos1]  The bad NAs have no SEQN and their row numbers look like NA.988 testdata[is.natestdatacotpos1,cSEQN,cotpos1]  The good NAs ones that are NA because LBXCOT was NA, and match is.na have SEQN and row numbers   cotpos2, with initialization to 0   testdatacotpos2 lt 0  Assume everyone is negative until found otherwise testdatacotpos2[testdataLBXCOT gt 10] lt 1  Positive cotinine test   3 tests to show we have no bad NAs at this point testdatacotpos2[testdatacotpos21]  No NAs that match 1 testdata[testdatacotpos21,cSEQN,cotpos2]  No lines with no SEQN values or strange row IDs like NA.988 testdata[is.natestdatacotpos2,cSEQN,cotpos2]  No good NAs either because we initialized everyone to 0   Now lets try finding the good NAs and setting them to NA since they were initialized to 0, which is not accurate if the blood test results were actually missing testdatacotpos2[is.natestdataLBXCOT] lt NA   Rerun the three tests, and they now show the bad NAs are back as well testdatacotpos2[testdatacotpos21]  Now there are NAs that match 1 testdata[testdatacotpos21,cSEQN,cotpos2]  Now there are lines with NA SEQN values and strange row IDs like NA.988 testdata[is.natestdatacotpos2,cSEQN,cotpos2]  These are the good NAs only, the bad ones dont show up here codepre  pThere are other ways I can do this that dont produce bad NAs, like using ifelse or using a package that does recodes, so my question isnt about how to make this work  its Why do the methods used in the code above produce the strange NA.988 rowsp  pFurther information in response to BondedDust Thank you for your reply. Can you please clarify which quirk of [] you are referring top  pI am aware of the quirk where if you feed it an NA, you get an all NA row, egp  precodeb  testdatacotpos11 b testdata[b,cSEQN,cotpos1] codepre  pthen anywhere b is NA I should expect the last line to return an NA. Is that the one you are referring to Unfortunately, with my code, the problem is that the weird NA rows are showing up in places where b wasnt NA, so that quirk would not explain it.p  pHere are the last lines of bp  precode[8725]  TRUE    NA FALSE FALSE    NA  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE    NA [8737] FALSE    NA FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE [8749]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE codepre  pHere are the last lines of testdata[b,cSEQN,cotpos1]p  precode8711   41422       1 NA.986    NA      NA NA.987    NA      NA 8722   41437       1 8725   41440       1 NA.988    NA      NA NA.989    NA      NA 8730   41447       1 NA.990    NA      NA NA.991    NA      NA 8742   41461       1 8748   41468       1 8749   41469       1 8751   41472       1 codepre  pThe strange NAs are showing up in places where b was not NAp  pFinal edit BondedDusts reply was correct. When I was saying b and the strange NAs dont match up above, I was failing to account for the fact that [] doesnt print rows corresponding to FALSE. Once you take the falses out, they match up perfectly.p

Negative 46457 psince I was at the first year of my University I always envied my fellows mainly coming from a techoriented professional school for knowing C. I came from a naturalsciencesoriented lyceum and never had programming experience or courses but some summer work with PHP learned from a teachyourselfPHPin7hours and my programming interest was very recent. I want to know ... was it a legitimate envy Does any programmer have to know C Does C provide deep understanding on how a system works or how programming has to be carried out I know that when programming C you have to have a strong understanding about buffers, memory, and so on. So I want your opinion on it.p

I am not talking about building sites like Stackoverflow.com or plentyoffish.com. This is about sites that are bigger than brochureware and smaller than ones that require dedicated servers.  p  pLet me give you an example.p  pa hrefhttpxmec.orgxmec.orga is an asp.net site I maintain for my college alumni. On an average its slated to hit around 10001100 views per day.br  At present its hosted on godaddy. The service is so damn pathetic I am using it only because of the lack of options. The site doesnt scale no, its not the code and the web control panels are extremely slow. The money I pay doesnt justify the service or the performance.

Negative 46457 pI cant seem to find a pointer in the right direction, I am not even sure what the terms are that I should be researching but countless hours of googling seem to be spinning me in circles, so hopefully the collective hive of intelligence of Stack Overflow can help.p  pThe problem is this, I need a way to filter data in what I can only call a compound logic tree.    Currently the system implements a simple AND filtering system.  For example, lets say we have a dataset of people.   You add a bunch of filters such that show all the people where Sex  Female AND Age  23 AND Age lt 30 AND  Status  Single.   Easy enough, iterate through each item, add to a valid items collection only if every condition is true. p  pThe problem Im encountering is how do I handle the user being able to build complex queries involved ands and ors  Im thinking of something like a tree where each node represents and expression evaluating its children to true or false.   A simplistic example would be  filter down to Sex  Male AND Age  25 OR Sex  Female AND Status  Single AND IQ  120.   Sorry I cant think of a better example at the moment.  But how would you go about representing this type of expression tree, and evaluating the items in a collection against these filters.     What are some references that would help  Hell, what are some damn Google searching that might lead into a positive directionp  pThanks to anyone that can provide any help.p  pHere is an example of a compound query in tree form using a dataset of peoplep  ul liQuery  Show me all people where sex is male and eyes are green or sex is female, eyes are blue, or status is single.

Negative 46457 pI have a mysql database table filled with 1000 records, lets say 5000 records. Each record has a codeprocessedcode boolean flag, default to codefalse 0code. What Id like to do is have a PHP script run on cron every minute.

The only thing which matters is that there will be a lot of requests 100sec now and growing to 500sec in a year, and I want to reduce the amount of webservers needed to process it.p  pThe current solution is done using PHP and memcache and the occasional hit to the SQL server backend.

Negative 46457 pGood Morning,p  pI got my app to install on the Backflip and started testing it.  On the emulator everything appeared ok but on the Backflip there are a few notable differences.p  pI have edittext boxes which on the emulator automatically vary in size to accommodate the text.  The text is a number, the max being two digits, i.e., 199.  On the Backflip the edit boxes seem to be a fixed width and that width is larger than needed.  Consequently some of the edittext boxes go past the end of the screen and cant be used or seen.  This doesnt happen on the emulator.p  pI also have spinners.  One set of spinners is created using android.R.layout.simplespinnerdropdownitem populated by an array from array.xml.  These spinners have the radio button showing and they work on both the emulator and the Backflip displaying a white background with black text.p  pThe other spinner is created using int layoutID  android.R.layout.simplespinneritem and is populated with strings from the database using an ArrayAdapter.  This spinner displays ok on the emulator with a white background with black text.  On the Backflip however, it displays the white background but with white text making the list essentially impossible to see.  The list is populated because when I press on an item the background color changes to red, the text is white, and the program works ok.p  pMy question is  Are these discrepancies peculiar to the Backflip or am I doing something wrong in the code  Id hate to think all devices come with peculiarities that require workarounds.  Hopefully Im doing something wrong and hope someone can point out what it is.  Ill post any code someone wants to see but right now I dont know what to post.  Thanks.p  p[Edit]  I should add that when I use android.R.layout.simplespinnerdropdownitem for the other spinner the text shows up ok but I now have the radio buttons which I dont want.p

Negative 46457 pI am just starting with ASP.Net. I copied a excoworkers code from .Net 1.1 era and it has a codeResponse.Endcode in case of an error.

I suspect that this worked differently before, or the error conditions were not tested very well.p  pAnyhow, I was able to stop using codeResponse.Endcode in case when I do not like the codeGETcode parameters, and use codereturncode instead. It seemed to do the right think in a simple case.p  pIs this Ok in generalp  pThere are some problems with the code I copied, but I do not want to do a rewrite I just want to get it running first and find wrinkles later. The codeResponse.Endcode caused a mental block for me, however, so I want to figure it out.p  pI want to keep the catch all clause just in case, at least for now. I could also end the method withp  precode        catch System.Threading.ThreadAbortException                      Response.End                  catch Exception ex                      Response.Writeex.Message             Response.End          codepre  pbut that just seems extremely stupid, once you think about all of the exceptions being generated.p  pPlease give me a few words of wisdom.

Has anyone observed thisp  pEDIT My problem doesnt have to do with the jars because From a hrefhttpwww.slf4j.orglegacy.html relnofollowhttpwww.slf4j.orglegacy.htmla p  pemOur JCL over SLF4J implementation will allow you to migrate to SLF4J gradually, especially if some of the libraries your software depends on continue to use JCL for the foreseeable future. You can immediately enjoy the benefits of SLF4Js reliability and preserve backward compatibility at the same time. Just replace commonslogging.jar with jcloverslf4j.jar. Subsequently, the selection of the underlying logging framework will be done by SLF4J instead of JCL but without the class loader headaches plaguing JCL. The underlying logging framework can be any of the frameworks supported by SLF4J. Often times, replacing commonslogging.jar with jcloverslf4j.jar will immediately and permanently solve class loader issues related to commons logging.emp

Karma could also be given if a user votes for an item in the same direction that other users with high karma have voted. If they vote in the opposite direction to other users with high karma, their vote would be considered incorrect and although itd lower the score of the item itd also lower their karma level, making them less influential in future voting.li liUsers can cast negative votes as well as positive votes.li liCalculated scores of items should take into account the age of the item over time the score would decrease as the item could become less reliable.li ul  pDoes anyone have any recommendations on the best algorithms for doing this, or any tips on how to implement this in a programming language such as PHPp

Negative 46457 pI wrote a generic inmemory BTree implementation in C few times ago, and Im thinking about making it persistent on disk which is why BTree have been designed for initially. My first thought was to use mmap Im under Linux to be able to manipulate the file as normal memory and just rewrite the strongnewstrong operator of my nodes classes so that it returns pointers in the mapped portion and create a smart pointer which can convert RAM adresses to file offset to link my nodes with others. But I want my implementation to be generic, so the user can store an int, an stdstring, or whatever custom class he wants in the Btree. Thats where the problem occurs for primitive types or aggregated types that do not contain pointers thats all good, but as soon as the object contains a pointerreference to an heap allocated object, this approach no longer works.p  pSo my question is is there some known way to overcome this difficulty My personnal searches on the topic end up unsuccessful, but maybe I missed something.p

Kind of like in CSS where you can do .class1 .class2 to specify that the class2 theme only applies if it is within an element with the class class1.p  pI do not wish to use any form of external DLLs or libraries for this task. I want to know if its possible to implement on my own.p  pIve tried using MultiTriggers with no luck.p  pI have a style that applies to all TextBlocks. I want the textblock to do the followingp  pemstrongIf the fontsize of the textblock is 11 and the parent elements style is PinnedSuggestion, set the foreground color to FF505050.emstrongp  pemstrongIf the fontsize of the textblock is 11 and the parent elements style is Suggestion, set the foreground color to FFCCCCCC.emstrongp  pThe conditions that I have tried to write to make this work, are as follows the fontsize condition is true, but the other one is not. The conditions are inside a style that applies to all textblocks in general.p  precode                ltMultiDataTriggergt                     ltMultiDataTrigger.Conditionsgt                         ltCondition BindingBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self, PathFontSize Value11 gt                         ltCondition BindingBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self, PathStyle ValueStaticResource PinnedSuggestion gt                     ltMultiDataTrigger.Conditionsgt                     ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueFFFF5050gtltSettergt                 ltMultiDataTriggergt codepre  pI am not sure what I am doing wrong in this case.

Negative 46457 pThe system hardware I write software for is physically connect via hardware in a tree structure.  The data model in our application is a Tree.

Receivers are the end of the line leaf nodes. xjc builds the classes.  I got the Unmarshaller to construct the object tree, but I cant figure out how to get a getter method for getDevice.  For tree traversal, I was hoping JAXB would provide something like getChildren, but Im not seeing in in the API. If I get a switcher object, I have the methods for getSwitcher and getReceiver, but no getDevice method.  But Im trying to avoid using eminstanceofem when I do a full tree traversal.  The Java code that xjc builds, does extend from the Device class, but I just havent learned how to get a generic getter method for all devices.  I just started with Jaxb two days ago and I have a ton to learn about the Jaxb API.p  pYesterday was my first day playing with JAXB, I think this tool suits our system incredible well.  Our hardware is literally a tree,we have multiple deployments, and using XML as our site config file to build a state model would be ideal.p  pAny suggestions for a JAXB novice herep

Each square also has an [x,y] list position variable and rbg color.p  pMy question is how to organize this all with classes Im trying to learn OOP. Logically, it seems that each frame contains squares, and each square contains variables like position, letter and color. But I suppose you could even think of it as each square contains 4 frames... My guess is make a frame class, and put 4 instances of it in a list if theres 4 frames and somehow make each frame instance contain a list of 16 square instances. Maybe usable like codeframes[2].squares[5].letter  fcode Just a fuzzy idea Im too new at OOP to know if thats remotely correct or a good idea. But it would be helpful to see how someone who knows what theyre doing would organize all this. Thanksp

Negative 46457 pYoull have to forgive me if this is a really basic question I havent used C this much in a long time so Ive forgotten how a lot of it works.p  pAnyway, I have a base class and a couple derived classes like this super oversimplified, but the gist is the samep  precodeclass Base  public    Base       int SomeFunction int x, int y  abstract definition   class Derived1  public Base  public    Derived1  Base      int SomeFunction int x, int y            actual implementation       return 4       class Derived2  public Base  public    Derived2  Base      int SomeFunction int x, int y            actual implementation       return 7      codepre  pLater on in codemaincode I have a list of codeBasecode objectsp  precodeBase baseobjects[10] codepre  pLater I fill that array with instances of codeDerived1code and codeDerived2code. That works with codebaseobjects[i]  ampnewDerived1code where codenewDerived1code is an instance of the codeDerived1code class. Thats all fine.p  pWhat I cant seem to figure out is how to later iterate through the codebaseobjectscode array and  call codeSomeFunctioncode on every instance in the list emwithout explicitly knowing which derived class Im usingem. Ive done this in C and it works fine, but apparently my C syntax is offp  precodeint result  baseobjects[i]gtSomeFunctiona, b codepre  pThat gives me a codeLNK2019code error when I try to compile, apparently because its looking at the codeBasecode class for the implementation and it isnt there.

No matter what I do WPF is looking to bind to a property of the ItemsControl ItemsSource codeProjectOrganLocation.LesionTypescode instead of codeSubOrganLocationscode.

Negative 46457 pI am trying to sub view a viewcontrollers view on key window of my application. I need to do it like in such a way that, from the app I will take the keywindow using [[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] and then will sub view a viewcontrollers view to that window. But I am not getting orientation changes in shouldRotateToInterface method of that viewcontroller. It fires once on initialization and one on dealloc but does not get fired on rotating the device. p  pDo I need to do any other method, How can I do transform of a view controllers view as the device orientation changes.. Please give me tutorial if possible.p  pThank you in advance p

Negative 46457 pIve been struggling now for some time with a crash in a C application that also uses a fair share of CCLI modules that are mostly wrappers around native libraries to access device drivers.

In trying to find a pattern in the memory that is overwritten I looked at the dissassembled code at the point of the crashp  precode0000gt u .a .a mscorwksWKSgcheapfindfirstobject0x54 79f935b9 89450c          mov     dword ptr [ebp0Ch],eax 79f935bc 8bd0            mov     edx,eax 79f935be 8b02            mov     eax,dword ptr [edx] 79f935c0 83e0fe          and     eax,0FFFFFFFEh 79f935c3 f70000000080    test    dword ptr [eax],80000000h      ltltltltCRASH 79f935c9 0f84b1000000    je      mscorwksWKSgcheapfindfirstobject0x73  0000gt r eax00000000 ebx01c81000 ecx01c80454 edx01c82fe0 esi012f0000 edi000027e1 eip79f935c3 esp0012d738 ebp0012d754 iopl0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc cs001b  ss0023  ds0023  es0023  fs003b  gs0000             efl00010246 mscorwksWKSgcheapfindfirstobject0x62 79f935c3 f70000000080    test    dword ptr [eax],80000000h ds002300000000 codepre  pThe crash happens when trying to dereference the EAX register which is null. Now from what I see EAX was loaded from contents pointed to by the EDX register so I looked at the address stored therep  precode0000gt dd edx10 01c82fd0  06542778 00000000 00000000 01c82494 01c82fe0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 01c82ff0  01b641d0 00000000 00000000 01c82380 codepre  pstrongEDIT I now see that my analysis was wrong, lacking was an understanding of x86 addressing modes.strongp  pSo I can see that starting at address 01c82fed the value stored at EDX the next 16 bytes are null.  But when looking at another similar crash dump I see the followingp  precode0000gt dd edx10 018defd4  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 018defe4  00000000 00000000 018b468c 01742354 018deff4  00e0907f 00000000 00000000 00000000 codepre  pSo here the 16 bytes before address pointed by EDX and the next 8 from there are null. And the same happens in the other crash dumps that I have, I dont see a pattern here, i.e. it doesnt seem that some piece of code is simply overwriting this region of the memory.p  pGoing back to the question what I would like to know is if there is some other explanation for the crash besides one piece of the code overwriting memory that it shouldnt. Or any advice at all in how to proceed, Im really lost in this one here.. p  pcould the pinned handles cause a problem We have quite a few of them and what I think that is that is funny is that I always see 137  no more no less  pinned handles with gchandles at the point of the crash, its a strange coincidence for me...p  pstrongEDITstrong forgot to mention that were using version 3.5 of the .Net framework. I see reports of similar crashes in .Net 4 when the background GC is active somewhere there is a mention that this is a bug in .Net but I dont think that this is relevant here since AFAIK there is no background GC in .Net 3.5.p

Negative 46457 pIm using a java applet to browse filesfolders on a remote server ftpcifs.  The problem is that, if a folder on the remote server is named in nonascii characterssay Japanese or Chinese language, the applet fails to launch. Ive traced back the problem which seems to be arising from incorrect parsing of the nonascii string in the server response. Following is a snippet of the xml response from the server.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gtltamultistatus xmlnsburnuuid xmlnscxml xmlnsaDAVgt ltaresponsegtltahrefgthttpsxx.xx.xx.xxfolderltahrefgtltapropstatgtltastatusgtHTTP1.1 200 OKltastatusgt codepre  pThe charset encoding from server is requested to be utf8 as above. The garbage looking string is the remote webfolder Im trying to view using the applet, the folder is actually named . Since the two are not equivalent actual folder name and the one in the xml, java xml parsing throws an error while trying to launch the applet. Please suggest what could be done to fix this. Also Im not using the SAX parser, Im using the XML parser and then create a DOM objectp

Negative 46457 pThis is not a question about a pertinent problem. Its a question by which I try to deepen my understanding of ObjectiveC or more specific Cocoa Foundation.p  pWhen dealing with uploading and download files from a server to my apps, Im constantly torn between using codeNSURLcode or codeNSStringcode for all things path related. Of course when theres an existing API I just use it according to the specs. But when I store my own paths or create custom classes that deal with them, Im confused which of the two would be the better pick.p  pcodeNSStringcode is used everywhere and it has convenience methods like codestringByAppendingPathComponentcode and codestringByAppendingPathExtensioncode. I can easily convert to NSURL by creating a new instance with code[NSURL URLWithStringstring]code and the other way around by calling code[url path]code on an NSURL instance. But the difference is there for a reason, rightp  pMy confusion grows when I look at header files of something like NSFileManager. These two methods are pretty close togetherp  precode BOOLcopyItemAtPathNSString srcPath toPathNSString dstPath errorNSError error  BOOLcopyItemAtURLNSURL srcURL toURLNSURL dstURL errorNSError error NSAVAILABLE106, 40 codepre  pWhy would I choose to use one over the other, especially when conversions between the two are made so easily And why does Apple go through the trouble of creating nearidentical APIs for using both data typesp  pIf someone has the deeper insight for when to use NSURL instead of NSString for your own classes handling file paths and remote urls, please do share Cheers.p

Negative 46457 pAssume a simple database for hotel reservations with three tables.p  pstrongTable 1 Reservationsstrong This table contains a checkin and checkout date as well as a reference to one or more rooms and a coupon if applicable.p  pstrongTable 2 Roomsstrong This table holds the data of all the hotel rooms with prices per night and number of beds.p  pstrongTable 3 Couponsstrong This table holds the data of all the coupons.p  pstrongOption 1strong If you want to get an overview of the reservations for a particular month with the total cost of each reservation, youd have to fetch the reservations, the rooms for each reservation, and the coupon if one is present.p  pWith this data, you can then calculate the total amount for the reservation.p  pstrongOption 2strong However, there is also another option, which is to store the total cost and discount in the reservation table so that it is much easier to fetch these calculations. The downside is that your data becomes much more dependent and much less flexible to work with. What I mean is that you have to manually update the total cost and discount of the reservation table every time you change a room or a coupon that is linked to a reservation.p  pWhat is generally recommended in terms of performance option 2 version data independence option 1.p  pUPDATE It is a MySQL database with over 500 000 rows reservations at this point, but is growing rapidly. I want to optimize database performance at an early stage to make sure that the UX remains fast and responsive.p
Negative 46457 pI would like to observe changes to settings values in [NSUserDefaults standardDefaults]. I am using the InAppSettingsKit to access and change settings in the program. Until now, I have just assumed all values have changed and sent notifications to all observers to update based on new values. This is not efficient and I only want to send notifications to observers when a relevant change has occurred. p  pCan someone suggest an efficient way to do thisp  pCan I assume that the value for any key from [NSUserDefaults standardDefaults] is never an array, set, or a dictionary Working with settings is new for me. This would probably help if I had to do a brute force scan for changes, comparing a beforedictionary with an afterdictionary. And it would not require any recursion. p  pIf this is already in the InAppSettingsKit, I havent seen it, and I would be glad if someone could point it out.p

Negative 46457 pWe are having two replica sets and one artiber node. In the replica set one is designated as primary and other as secondary.

None of them gets elected as primary. rs.status displays an error as below NOTE We tried changing the priority of prisecondary nodes manually.

Negative 46457 pI have been struggling with getting Windows Authentication to work with my MVC3 application in development VS 2010 SP1, with no real luck so far.  I am running XP on my dev machine no money until next year for an upgrade, if that makes a difference.  I should also mention I am using IIS Express as the default web development server from VS 2010.p  pI started with an empty MVC3 app awhile back, as I didnt have the Intranet template available from the VS menu until I upgraded the MVC3 tools yesterday OK, I was a little slow.  Once I installed and inspected that template, I added a reference to DirectoryServices to my project and added the bit of code that displays the current loggedon user in the upper right corner of the page.  According to the graphics, it should now say Welcome PCEdnewmanp  pI followed the excellent instructions in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4762538iisexpresswindowsauthenticationIIS Express Windows Authenticationa and did make some headway.  However, I now get the 401.2 error from IIS Express, telling me I am not authorized...p  pSo, I went in to my project properties and set Anonymous Authentication to Enabled.  Now I can access the web page, but what I see in the upper right corner of my page is Welcome   no username.p  pI tried this with both IE and Firefox, with the same result. What the amp am I missing here  It seems I am not logged in to Windows Where do I need to start looking for the problemp  pAt a previous employer a couple of years back, I wrote a Windows Forms app that authenticated the user with their Windows logon credentials.  In that case, I had to take special care to both send the credentials and then to explicitly authenticate them on the service end. Is there something I have to do to make the browser include credentials with every GET or POSTp  pBy request, heres the contents of my web.config, with apologies for all the Glimpse config stuff.p  precodeltxml version1.0    encodingutf8gt ltconfigurationgt   ltconfigSectionsgt     ltsection nameglimpse           typeGlimpse.Core.Configuration.GlimpseConfiguration gt   ltconfigSectionsgt   ltappSettingsgt     ltadd keyClientValidationEnabled       valuetrue gt     ltadd keyUnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled       valuetrue gt   ltappSettingsgt   ltsystem.webgt     ltcompilation debugtrue               targetFramework4.0gt       ltassembliesgt         ltadd assemblySystem.Web.Abstractions, Version4.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31BF3856AD364E35 gt         ltadd assemblySystem.Web.Routing, Version4.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31BF3856AD364E35 gt         ltadd assemblySystem.Web.Mvc, Version3.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 gt         ltadd assemblySystem.Web.Helpers, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31BF3856AD364E35 gt         ltadd assemblySystem.Web.WebPages, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken31BF3856AD364E35 gt       ltassembliesgt     ltcompilationgt     ltpagesgt       ltnamespacesgt         ltadd namespaceSystem.Web.Mvc gt         ltadd namespaceSystem.Web.Mvc.Ajax gt         ltadd namespaceSystem.Web.Mvc.Html gt         ltadd namespaceSystem.Web.Routing gt         ltadd namespaceSystem.Web.Helpers gt         ltadd namespaceSystem.Web.WebPages gt       ltnamespacesgt     ltpagesgt     lttrace writeToDiagnosticsTracetrue         enabledtrue         pageOutputfalse gt     lthttpModulesgt       ltadd nameGlimpse         typeGlimpse.Core.Module gt     lthttpModulesgt     lthttpHandlersgt       ltadd pathglimpse.axd         verbGET,POST         typeGlimpse.Core.Handler gt     lthttpHandlersgt   ltsystem.webgt   ltsystem.webServergt     ltsecuritygt       ltauthenticationgt         ltanonymousAuthentication enabledfalsegt         ltwindowsAuthentication enabledtrue gt       ltauthenticationgt     ltsecuritygt     ltmodules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststruegt       ltadd nameGlimpse         typeGlimpse.Core.Module,Glimpse.Core         preConditionintegratedMode gt     ltmodulesgt     ltvalidation validateIntegratedModeConfigurationfalse gt     lthandlersgt       ltadd nameGlimpse         pathglimpse.axd         verbGET,POST         typeGlimpse.Core.Handler,Glimpse.Core         preConditionintegratedMode gt     lthandlersgt   ltsystem.webServergt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt     ltbindingsgt       ltnetTcpBindinggt         ltbinding nameNetTcpBindingIReporting               maxBufferSize1024000               maxBufferPoolSize1000000               maxReceivedMessageSize1024000gt           ltreaderQuotas maxDepth200                      maxStringContentLength65536                      maxArrayLength32768                      maxBytesPerRead4096                      maxNameTableCharCount16384 gt           ltsecurity modeNone gt         ltbindinggt         ltbinding namenormalBindinggt           ltsecurity modeNone gt         ltbindinggt       ltnetTcpBindinggt     ltbindingsgt     ltclientgt       ltendpoint nametcpAdminServiceEndpoint              addressnet.tcpPCESRV22.pce.local9000ProductionMonitorAdminService              bindingnetTcpBinding              bindingConfigurationnormalBinding              contractContracts.IAdmin gt       ltendpoint nametcpMasterDataServiceEndpoint              addressnet.tcpPCESRV22.pce.local9010ProductionMonitorMasterDataService              bindingnetTcpBinding              bindingConfigurationnormalBinding              contractContracts.IMasterData gt       ltendpoint nametcpReportingServiceEndpoint              addressnet.tcpPCESRV22.pce.local9030ProductionMonitorReportingService              bindingnetTcpBinding              bindingConfigurationNetTcpBindingIReporting              contractContracts.IReporting gt     ltclientgt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt   ltruntimegt     ltassemblyBinding xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1gt       ltdependentAssemblygt         ltassemblyIdentity nameSystem.Web.Mvc                        publicKeyToken31bf3856ad364e35 gt         ltbindingRedirect oldVersion1.0.0.02.0.0.0                       newVersion3.0.0.0 gt       ltdependentAssemblygt     ltassemblyBindinggt   ltruntimegt   ltglimpse enabledtrue gt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pI am more than willing to divulge more details as needed, but I really dont even know where to start looking.

Negative 46457 pIs it advisable to use a handler to display Images  the issue is i cannot right click and save these images .It shows the Handler name and Asp.net Generic handler  as save type so i cant save the image but the GUI image is amazing in quality.I am showing a single image in different sizes using 2 handlers and the code works fine but if then if I dont use the Handler i have to re size them individually and then store them in different folders.p

Negative 46457 pI am looking for a free Java code analysismetrics tool that I can use to see class dependencies, method execution times, etc, and possibly to print out a diagram that shows them. I am currently using a jdepend task in ANT to achieve this, but Im thinking there must be a better tool for that sort of thing. I would also prefer if it was integrated with Netbeans, since Id rather not port all my projects to Eclipse for the task of analyzing.  I have tried to play with the community version of Visual Paradigm, but I got sick of it really fast when it didnt offer code synchronization in the community edition.  Although I can give it another shot if that is indeed the way to go.  I also tried BOUML, but it seems to be more of a UML design tool than an existing code analyzer.  So, my question is, what do you guys use for Java code analysis  Thanksp  pEDIT For instance, JDepend measures a few metrics and can draw a nice little dependency graph, but it doesnt exactly have a UI or anything.  I guess Im looking for a tool that can draw out all my classes and their dependencies on each other jdepend only does packages AFAIK as well as the methods that are called between the classes and provides a metric number of how good the code structure is. I apologize if the question is vague, Im just looking for a variety of options and I dont exactly have a lot of experience with code metrics tools...p

Negative 46457 pI recently switched to R, and I love it.

Ive tried and tried to figure out how to do it in R, but one of the big pitfalls of using a language named R for which there is also a statistic R and searching for terms like Adjust are that I can only seem to find hits on adjusted R squared. Its beyond frustrating.p  pSo, at the risk of asking a really easy question, does anyone know how to do this Ive looked into predictive margins, and that seems like at least a related type of method, but its implementation usually involves standardizing the explanatory variables in some way. p

Below is the code from my MainViewControllerp  precode voidloadView      [super loadView]     UIButton testButton[UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeRoundedRect]     [testButton setFrameCGRectMake80,50,160,50]     [testButton setTitleClick Me forStateUIControlStateNormal]     [testButton addTargetself actionselectorbuttonClicked forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]      [self.view addSubviewtestButton]   voidbuttonClickedidsender      NSLogButton Clicked  codepre  pI enabled Zombie Objects and was able to find the following message in the debug logsp  precode20120221 224600.911 test[2601f803]  [MainViewController performSelectorwithObjectwithObject] message sent to deallocated instance 0x6b4bba0 codepre  pLooking at the above message, it seems to me that ARC is prematurely releasing my MainViewController. I am not sure what I am doing wrong here. Please let me know if I am missing something.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 46457 pI am monitoring an application using Zabbix and have defined a custom item which returns a string value. Since my items values are actually checksums, they will only contain the characters code[09af]code. Two mirror copies of my application are running on two servers for the sake of redundancy. I would like to create a trigger which would take the item values from both machines and fire if they are not the same.p  pFor a moment, lets forget about the moment when values change its not an atomic operation, so the system may see inconsistent state, which is not a real error, for a short time, since I could work around it by looking at several previous values.p  pThe crux is stronghow to write a Zabbix trigger expression which could compare for equality the string values of two items the same item on two mirror hosts, actuallystrongp  pBoth according to a hrefhttpwww.zabbix.comdocumentation1.8manualconfigtriggers relnofollowthe fine manuala and as I confirmed in praxis, the standard operators codecode and codecode only work on numeric values, so I cant just write the natural codehost1myitem[param].last0  host2myitem[param].last0code. Functions such as codechangecode or codediffcode can only compare values of the same item at different points in time. Functions such as coderegexpcode can only compare the items value with a constant stringregular expression, not with another items value. This is very limiting.p  pI could move the comparison logic into the script which my custom item executes, but its a bit messy and not elegant, so if at all possible, I would prefer to have this logic inside my Zabbix trigger.p  pPerhaps despite the limitations listed above, someone can come up with a workaroundp

Negative 46457 pIn my application window I have two NSViews. On the left the NSView Menu contains a few buttons. When one of the buttons is clicked it should change the contents of the right NSView Content.p  pFor each of the views on the right I have a separate NSViewControllers that get loaded and their views gets added as a subview. When a further button gets pressed on the left the added subviews on the right should be removed and the new view should be loaded as a subview. p  pTo accomplish this I load my Menu in AppDelegate with the following p  precode MenuVC menuSubView  [[MenuVC alloc] initWithNibNameMenuVC bundle nil]     menuSubView.contentView  NSView[self contentView]     [[self menuView] addSubview[menuSubView view]] codepre  pThis works fine. As you can see I have a NSView pointer in the Menu VC which points to the contentView so that I can populate it with the subviews.p  pNow as a method for one of the button presses I do the followingp  precodeSomeContentVC subView  [[SomeContentVC alloc] initWithNibNameSomeContentVC bundlenil]     [self.contentView addSubview[subView view]] codepre  pThis does not work. p  pIf I however add a subview from the awakeFromNib method of the MenuViewController implementation in the case of default content when the app opens it works. However when I try to remove that subview using p  precode[[self.contentView setSubviews[NSArray array]] codepre  pI cant. Interesting is also that if I try to count the number of subviews even after having added one in the awakeFromNib method it returns 0 subviews for self.contentView.

Negative 46457 pHi I have just released my app update with push notifications added into it. I was worried that it would not work properly so I did a bunch of testing. First with just a development certificate and then a production certificate using adhoc. Both ended up working and I was pleased when the adhoc worked. p  pAnyways the update has been live for about 8 hours now and for some reason push isnt working. I checked with my friend and have realized that the user is not being asked whether he wants to accept push notifications from my app. Which means when the token gets sent to my server, its appearing as null. I have no idea why this is happening. When he goes into device settings  notifications  my app does not appear on any of the lists receiving push notifications or not receiving.p  pThis is the code in my delegate that should trigger the requestp  precode[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes  UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge  UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound  UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert] codepre  pIf anyone knows why this is happening, input would be much appreciated.

Negative 46457 pIm building an app with iPodlike controls play, pause, etc. The app has tableView with track names in each cell. I have a codeMainViewControllercode with a codeUITableViewcode and a custom codeUITableViewCellcode class. The player controls exist in the codeMainViewControllercode.p  pI also have a playpause button in each cell. Ive successfully set up codeNSNotificationscode to post a notification when the play button is pressed in the cell, so the track info is sent to the observer and responder method in codeMainViewControllercode and the player controls driven by codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode is initiated.p  pThis works, but once the track is playing, I cant figure out how to make the playpause button in the cell mirror the state of the playpause button in my iPod controls. I dont think adding a codeNSNotification observercode in every cell is the correct way of doing this. p  pAdditional info The playpause button image in the codeMainViewControllercode player is determined by a method that fires every half second and checks the codeplaybackstatecode of the codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode. If playing, the player button sets the play image. If paused, it sets the pause image. Im thinking the implementation to also set the tableCell playpause button will go here. p  pstrongEditstrong This method is called whenever the playback state changes via NSNotification, within my UITableViewController. codeplayButtoncode is the playpause button in the player controls, not the playpause in the table cell in which Im trying to update according to playback state.p  precode void updateViewForPlayerState   Change playButton image depending on playback state [playButton setImagemoviePlayer.playbackState  MPMoviePlaybackStatePlaying  pauseBtnBG  playBtnBG forStateUIControlStateNormal]   codepre

Negative 46457 pCocoa newbie here and I seem to be getting into all the really arcane stuff first. I wanted an NSTextField in which the contents were selected by default when clicked, and in which I could change the selection color. I found enough on this forum to get me started in the mysteries of field editors. I have NSTextField subclassed, and the becomeFirstResponder method overriddenp  precode BOOL becomeFirstResponder      if super.becomeFirstResponder return NO     NSTextView  fieldEditor  NSTextView  [self.window fieldEditorYES forObjectself]     [fieldEditor performSelectorselectorselectAll withObjectfieldEditor afterDelay0]     [fieldEditor setSelectedTextAttributesselectionColor]     return YES  codepre  pWhere selectionColor is a oneitem NSDictionary with an NSColor object keyed to NSBackgroundColorAttributeName. This works perfectly for text fields on windows and panels, but doesnt work at all for fields in the view of an NSPopover. In fact, it makes text selection impossible. It is still possible to click in the field and type, but dragging the cursor through text to select it fails. I can only conclude Im misconfiguring the field editor somehow. Am I referencing it correctlyp
Negative 46457 pIm working on signal processing issues. Im extracting some features for feeding a classifier. Among these features, there is the sum of first 5 FFT coefficients. As you know primary FFT coefficients actually indicate how dominant low frequency components of a signal are. This is very close to what a lowpass filter gives.p  pHere Im suspicious about whether computing FFT to take those first 5 coefficients is an unnecessary task. I think applying lowpass filter will just eliminate lowfrequency components and it wont have a significant effect on primary FFT coefficients. However there may be some other way in combination with lowpass filter in order to extract same information that is contained in first five FFT coefficients without using FFT.p  pDo you have any ideas or suggestions regarding this issuep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 46457 pSo I ran into a peculiar problem this morning, and I was wondering if the community could help me figure it out.  So Ive been doing codegit pull origin mastercode when I want to fetch and merge the projects changes from the remote master copy and bring them to my local master.  Ive been running into some merging issues lately though, so I did an experiment. I did a codegit pull origin mastercode like always, and got the message that said Already uptodate.  Then I did a normal codegit pullcode and then saw all of my coworkers changes rolling in and merging with my local master branch.  Why did a git pull origin master not work, but a git pull did  I wonder how many changes I havent been seeing because of this quirk I discovered.  Ive done some research to find out what the differences are but I still havent found a reason why my repo wasnt being updated properly with a git pull origin master, when Ive seen changes being fetched and merged into my branch with that method before.  Thoughtsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 46457 pIm working on the admin part of an MVC webapp. I had the idea to use widgets for a single Admin panel.

After clicking save, the users would be redirected to the Index view, which would just show the dropdownlist again.p  pSo I have a Index.cshmtl, and an EditLanguage.cshtml as nonpartial views, and a LanguageWidget.cshtml as a partial view.p  pFirst the user sees the Index view.p  precode    public ViewResult Index              return View      codepre  pThis view has the following code in itp  precodeusing CodeBox.Domain.Concrete.ORM      ViewBag.Title  Index     Layout  ViewsSharedLayout.cshtml  lth2gtAdministrationlth2gt Html.ActionLanguageWidget codepre  pThe Partial view LanguageWidget just contains the following code, and when the user submits it posts to the HttpPost annotated method in my controllerp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormLanguageWidget, Admin      Html.DropDownListFormodel gt model.SelectedItem, Model.Languages     ltinput typesubmit valueEditgt  codepre  pThis is the HttpPost method for the widget         [HttpPost]         public ActionResult LanguageWidgetLanguageWidgetModel model                      var lang  langRepo.Languages.FirstOrDefaultl  l.LanguageId  model.SelectedItem             return ViewEditLanguage, lang         p  pThis takes the user to the language edit page, which works fine.p  pBut then The user edits the language and submits the page, which invokes the EditLanguage HttpPost method, so the language is saved properly.p  precode    [HttpPost]     public ViewResult EditLanguageLanguage model              if ModelState.IsValid                      langRepo.SaveLanguagemodel             TempData[message]  string.Format0 has been saved, model.Name             return ViewIndex                  else                      return Viewmodel               codepre  pSo, when I return the Index view  which seems logical I guess  the controller still assumes this is a HttpPost request, and when it renders the Index view, it invokes the LanguageWidget method, assuming it has to render the HttpPost method.p  pThis leads to the LanguageWidget HttpPost method, which returns a full view with layout, returning just that, so I have my layout, with view, containing a layout, with the editview.p  pI dont really see how I could fix thisp  pIm pretty sure its a design flaw from my part, but I cant figure it out.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 46457 pIt seems to me that languages that are quite simple to use i.e. Python often have slower execution times than languages that are deemed more complex to learn i.e. C or Java.  Why  I understand that part of the problem arises from the fact that Python is interpreted rather than compiled, but what prevents Python or another highlevel language from being compiled efficiently  Is there any programming language that you feel does not have this trade offp

Negative 46457 pSome quick background here, I just started using the LibGDX framework for my first attempts at Android game development.  I am trying to build a texture using their FrameBuffer class by placing in sprites, and I want to use this texture as a sort of levelbylevel dynamicrandom background.  p  pUnfortunately, it seems that when the sprites are added to the FrameBuffer, they will completely overwrite anything beneath them.  In general this is fine, however many of the sprites I will be using for this have semitransparent pixels, and because these transparent pixels will overwrite any solid pixels beneath them, it shows through to the base background color and produces a very unpleasant effect.p  pIn other words, what is the best way to go about creating one solid texture out of multiple sprites, and layer them on top of each other without completely removing the lower pixels At least if the top pixel is semitransparentp  pHaving experimented and searched for quite a few hours on this, I am at a loss.  Thanks for your timep  pstrong edit strongp  pHere is the code used to add the sprites to the FBO.

Negative 46457 pI have a vector that adds objects that contain codeSDLSurfacecode pointers as data members which means i have to use a copy constructor to implement a deep copy for the pointers. The object frees the surfacespointers in the destructor and this is where the problem occurs.

Negative 46457 pIm trying to create an object which de facto is analogue of Pythons codelistcode object. In my code I have the following classes codeobjecttypecode, codetypetypecode, codenonetypecode, codebooltypecode, codeinttypecode, codefloattypecode, codebytestypecode, where codeobjecttypecode is abstract class. p  pAbstract class has some virtual functions like codetypetype typevoidcode, codebytestype namevoidcode, codebytestype reprvoidcode, codebooltype boolvoidcode, codeinttype intvoidcode, codefloattype floatvoidcode, codebytestype bytesvoidcode.p  pcodetypetypecode class has following constructor codetypetypeobjecttypecode during construction pointer to source object is stored to codeobjecttype typetypecdatacode and is used when user wants to compare two types using codetypetypeeqconst typetypeampcode function this function uses codetypeidcode as you might have been guessed.p  pI need to create codelisttypecode object, which can store any object which is based on codeobjecttypecode. It must have codegetconst inttypeampcode function to get an element and codesetconst inttypeamp, objecttypecode function to set an element. All objects are stored inside codestdvectorltobjecttypegt cdatacode.p  pHow can I force codelisttypegetconst inttypeampcode to return correct object Lets imagine we have codelisttypecode, which contains three elements code[bytestype object0, inttype object1, floattype object3]code. Using codelisttypeget0code should return codebytestype object0code. Probably function codetypetype objecttypetypecode can be useful.p  pThere is a diffictulty that user can create a new codeobjecttypecode based type during execution all what Ive described is used to create a new toylanguage. However all types are based on codeobjecttypecode and has its virtual functions.p  pDo you have any ideas Id be glad to meet your advice.p  pP.S. git repository a hrefhttpsgithub.comghostmansdquirinus relnofollowhttpsgithub.comghostmansdquirinusap

All servers run in their own local time and keep logs with time entries that are local to the server.

DST strongdoes NOTstrong apply to this date in JANUARY so the date parsed should be 123456 in new york time, a.k.a 173456 in UTC because its 5, no DSTp  pNY server log says em20130701em ... DST strongDOESstrong apply to this date in june so the date parsed should be 123456 in new york time, a.k.a 163456 in UTC because its 4, with the DSTp  pHK server, both date times parse to 043456 UTCp  pThanks guysp

Negative 46457 h1Outlineh1  pMy question involves the use of KineticJS, but before Ill ask the question  Ill outline the project and then discuss my problem.p  h2The Taskh2  pMy task is create a resizing fireplace surround so that said individual can use a number form to change the size of the surround, the only pieces that should actually change are its Jambs legs either side in their Height and the mantel across the top.p  pNow the surround needs to be made from images, so its been broken down into seperate elements so when the width of the image is stretched the whole surround isnt.p  pIve created the canvas and referenced KineticJs the framework Im using for this project to benefit from its easy to use layer and stage design similar to that of Adobe Flash.p  h2The Issueh2  pMy problem occurs after loading all the images required. Ive used abit of JQUERY to call the function to draw the surround and load its seperate parts once the document is ready.p  pOnce there I have a change event function ready to resize the surround once the user interacts with the number form.p  pIssue is all of the surround variables are contained in a function called drawsomethingp  pNow theyre local to that function I require them in another.p  pIm aware ill probably have to restructure my code to get this to work.

Negative 46457 pI am working on an Android application where I am using a single OpenGL ES instance.  In some instances, I am drawing a custom rectangular dialog ontop of everything else, with scrolling text, lines, etc.  The dialog does not take up the whole screen, and I am drawing content that is emlargerem than the dialog box, which is scrolling across the dialog, like a marquee.p  pOf course, since I am drawing this dialog emlastem ontop of every other view, all the vertices I am drawing are going to be visible, but I would like to tell OpenGL to emnotem draw outside of the dialog rectangle for any of its rendering commands.  Like this...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGHhL1.png altCulling to rectanglep  pMost of my drawing is done with codeglDrawArrays...code using codeFloatBuffercode arrays.  What I would like is a way to specify to OpenGL that I want emanyem drawing to be invisible outside of a specified region.p  pI dont know much about culling, but this seems to be very related to what Im looking for.  However, culling seems to only be for skipping the drawing of triangles that wouldnt be seen from the camera view in a 3D, whereas I would like to skip the drawing of any triangles outside of an arbitrary rectangle within the viewport.p

Negative 46457 pThis question is related to an earlier, more general question I asked on JavaC communication, but I think its probably specific enough to ask separately let me know if you think Im wrong  I havent marked that one as answered yet and will come back to it once I figure out the solution that works best, this question is a step towards that...p  pIm trying to use named pipes to communicate between C and Java.

So when instantiating the pipe, my code isp  precode instructionPipe  new NamedPipeServerStreamInstructionPipe, PipeDirection.InOut, 4,PipeTransmissionMode.Byte,PipeOptions.Asynchronous  instructionPipe.BeginWaitForConnectionnew AsyncCallbackinstructionPipeServerConnected, new Object codepre  p..And then I write a callback called instructionPipeServerConnected that does the stuff I want on getting a connection.p  pOn the Java side, again following the example in the blog, I set up the pipe on the Java side by writingp  precode    instructionPipeJavanew RandomAccessFile.pipe  InstructionPipe,rw codepre  pHowever, if I try to write some test data onto this pipe in Javap  precode   instructionPipeJava.writeThis Is Test Text.getBytes codepre  pAnd run the code, then the code stalls and cant get past this line.  If I dont use an asynchronous pipe, then instructionPipeJava will be able to write this text to the pipe just fine.  However I need to use an async pipe to use callbacks on the c side.  p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions  Perhaps the issue is that I am using new RandomAccessFile.. to create the pipe in Java and there is a more suitable way to do this to connect to an async C pipe  Thank you for any advice you can offerp  pBest, Chrisp

Negative 46457 pIve got a .txt file containing 4,000 lines,Im trying to insert them into mysql,here are two approaches which do the same thing,the first approach is simple coded like thisp  precodestart  microtimetrue foreachb as kgtvb is an array of 4,000 elements     dbgtexecINSERT INTO siji en,cn VALUES v[0],v[1]  echo microtimetruestart116 sec. codepre  pIt takes 116 sec.The second way is using PDObindParam,I know that for repeated SQL query it is a good practice to use bindparam because the only difference between each query is their values,so I coded like thisp  precode    start  microtimetrue stmt  dbgtprepareINSERT INTO siji en,cn VALUES en,cn stmtgtbindParamen,en stmtgtbindParamcn,cn foreachb as kgtvb is an array of 4,000 elements     en  v[0]     cn  v[1]     stmtgtexecute  echo microtimetruestart127 sec. codepre  pThe second approach is surposed to be faster than the first one,the result is not as what I thought to be though,Could anyone tell me does bindparam really speed up bulk insertionOr what could possibly be wrong when using bindparamp

Negative 46457 pin my Java application I have to validate XML documents in different versions of DocBook format. DocBook 4 is based on DTD, DocBook 5 is based on RelaxNGSchematron. What is the appropriate way for beeing able to validate against the different schema languages I found Oracle MultiSchema XML Validator MSV, JARV and oNVDL. The latter seems to be deprecated. At the moment I use SAXParserXMLReader. But theres no support for RelaxNG. I thought about combining with Jing but I look for a clean structure to do it.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 46457 pI have multiple java files that I am working on which use many of the same methods. As of now when I update any of the methods I will have to find that method in the other files and update them by hand. I am wondering how I can do this through implementing the methods from a master file which will hold the bodies of the many different methods that I am using universally. In my research I thought that I could do this through interfaces, but when I create an interface, it does not allow me to add a body... So, obviously I am doing something wrong there or using interfaces incorrectly. In any case, what is the best was to accomplish this goalp
Negative 46457 pThere is an excellent tutorial on a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewhubsapihubsapiguidejavascriptclientcallserverSignalRa that explains how to pass .NET objects as parameters to Javascript and vice versa.

Each textField is an instance variable.p  pIm alloc initing the textField instance variables when my add method gets called.p  pMy question is Is it OK to call this add method on my viewController which instantiates the instance variables and uses them, and then later, call the same method again which would be calling alloc init on instance variables that were already allocd and inited the last time the method was called.p  pThus calling alloc init on the same ivars without niling them first  im also using ARCp  pSomething like this pseudocodep  pstrong.hstrongp  precodeproperty UITextField textField codepre  pstrong.mstrongp  precodesynthesize textField    void someMethod   textField  [[UITextField alloc] init]  [textField doSomethingElse]   codepre  pstrongLATERstrongp  pSome method is called over and over again.p  pShould I instead alloc init all the textfields, and just add and remove them from my UIView in the add methodp  pThanks, Regards, Johnp
Negative 46457 pMaybe I think to much in C, but I dont see a solution how to solve this properly in java. I get a response from my server which sends a string like thisp  precodecommand params ltxml...gt codepre  pThe client receives that string and extracts the command. Now I would like to call a function which knows how to handle the command. On the C side the solution is obvious. I implemented an array with the command name and associated function pointes, so I can simply loop through the array and call the function.p  pIs there some way to do this on Java as well I dont know that I could call a function based on the name. So currently I see the following optionsp  ol liDo a series of codeifcommand.euqalsCOMMANDcodeli liFor each command I could create a separate object which I can store in an array very messy.li liUse reflection, so I can have a map with the function names vs. command names.li ol  pAre there any other optionsp  pThe if statements is not the best IMO, but at least it allows for compiler errors and typechecking. Using reflection is at least more elegant because I can loop and extend it more easily, but of course, it means that I can see only runtime errors if I misstype the names.p

Negative 46457 pIm using opencv2.4.6, and kinect sdk to do multi kinect calibration. After I get image data from kinects, I turn them into opencv images, and follow some tutorials, e.g. RGBDemo, and use the following pipelinep  precodefind the corners cvfindChessboardCornersimage, patternSize, corners, CVCALIBCBNORMALIZEIMAGECVCALIBCBADAPTIVETHRESH cvtColorimage, grayimage, CVBGR2GRAY cornerSubPixgrayimage, corners, cvSize5,5, cvSize1,1, cvTermCriteria CVTERMCRITEPSCVTERMCRITITER, 30, 0.1   after I collect 20 sets of corners, do calibration CalcCameraIntrinsiccornersrc, rgbintrsrc, coeffsrc CalcCameraIntrinsiccornerdist, rgbintrdist, coeffdist  cvstereoCalibratepatternPoints, cornersrc, cornerdist, rgbintrsrc, coeffsrc, rgbintrdist, coeffdist,     cvSizewidth, height, R, T, E, F,      cvTermCriteriacvTermCriteriaCOUNTcvTermCriteriaEPS, 50, 1e6, cvCALIBFIXINTRINSIC codepre  pI think my corner positions are right because I use drawChessboardCorners and find no error. After all these steps, I get a rotation matrix and translation vector. When I do these transform to the point clouds I get from the kinects, I found they are not aligned.p  pNo idea about why. I dont think its about the order of images. No matter which point cloud I apply the transform to, I cant get the right alignment. The only reason I guess is the parameters of opencv function.p  pstrongThanks for you attentionstrongp  p820 Edit Although no one answer me, I get one possible reason The point cloud is based on pixel, while the matrix I got from opencv is based on meters. I have changed the point cloud to meters, but its also not good. I found that the matrix I got is possibly right. So I doubt its maybe something wrong with my display function. I will post the conclusion if I find the answer. p  p821 Edit I have found out the reason. I made a mistake in the difference between opencv and opengl. Now the matrix can align the two point clouds, but not very perfect.p

Negative 46457 pSo I have a global object called bbydataset and I am looping through some data and pushing it to bbydataset with extend. Except that the datasets pushing are always starting at 0. So when I do an extend the second time the first dataset gets overwritten. p  precodevar bbydataset   function bbytestpage  .ajax     type GET,     url httpapi.remix.bestbuy.comv1productsproductTemplatePrintersformatjsonampshowmanufacturer,sku,modelNumber,name,regularPriceamppageSize100amppagepageampapiKeyAPIKEY,     cache true,     dataType jsonp,     success function data          ifdata.totalPages  page             .extendbbydataset, data.products             bbytestdata.currentPage  1         else             .extendbbydataset, data.products             bbycallbbydataset                 bbytest1 codepre  pThe objects look like the following obj1 0, 1, 2 obj2 0, 1, 2. So bbydataset first loop takes in obj1 but when obj2 goes through the data is replaced instead of extended. I cant really show the result. p  pTo be clear I understand that its not working because of the above Im wondering if there is a way to do like an append to the end that auto changes the names to 3, 4, 5 or something. Otherwise although the first one can simply be added there after you would have to loop through each object and append it as a new object through extend.p

This is done using the following codep  hr  precodeSensorSample sample  null foreach var d in input      SampleData data  new SampleData     data.SampleDataTypeId  dataTypeId     data.SampleUnitId  unitId     data.Value  d.Value       check for existing sample for this sensor and timestamp     sample  SensorSamples.FirstOrDefaults gt s.SensorId  sensor.Id ampamp s.SampleTime  d.Timestamp     if sample  null               sample doesnt exist, create a new one         sample  new SensorSample         sample.SampleTime  d.Timestamp         sample.SensorId  sensor.Id         sensor.SensorSamples.Addsample           add the data to the sample     sample.SampleData.Adddata  codepre  hr  pI have tried optimizing the inserting of sample data by doing it in batches i.e. 1000 records at a time. This does help, but even though there is an index on the codeSampleTimecode field, the lookup query seems to take longer as more records are added.p  pSo, my question is, how do I improve the design andor performance of adding sample data to the database Is there a better database structure for handling the onetomany relationship I am willing to make some compromises on database design if I can get an appropriate offset in performance, but I still need to be able to handle different data associated with a given codeSampleTimecode.p
Negative 46457 pIm new to python, just have one questionp  pPython dont need to declare variable types. For example, when we use functions, we dont declare which type should be passed in. So sometimes, I cant figure out which type the passed in parameter actually is or do I pass in an invalid parameter.p  pFor example, a parameter named rundate, Its type can be string or datetime or date. I have to find it from the code...p  pIs there a way to solve this problem I think I should do good naming. But howtop  pI dont mean to check the type in the code. I just get confused with the function parameters when coding... I always forget which type the parameter is...p
Negative 46457 pIve an application visual c written using vs2010, I have two buttons start and stop,the first one calls a function that takes a lot of time to process, so in a certain moment Id like to stop the computation pressing stop button.

Negative 46457 pIm working on an application built using C and WPF, which badly implements MVVM. The breakdown of work is something likep  ul lipViewp  ul liPresentation, bitmaps, colors, etc.li liAnimations if usedli liCommunicates with the ViewModel by being data bound to itli liCommunicates with the ViewModel by raising commands on itli ulli lipViewModelp  ul liExposes commands to be invoked by viewsli liDelegates data processing functionality to the modelli liDefines UI behaviorli liNo direct named dependency on the viewli liCommunicates with the Model by calling methods in the modelli liMay be notified of changes in the model by subscribing to events exposed by the modelli ulli lipModelp  ul liDisk persistence, data analysis, etcli liEverything elseli liNo dependency on the ViewModelli ulli ul  pUnfortunately, this has resulted in circular references, because views need references to viewmodels to raise events and fire commands, viewmodels need references to views in order to update view state typically this reference is by a viewmodel being WPFs codeDataContextcode, viewmodels need a reference to models to delegate work, and models often need to notify viewmodels of some external change in state.p  pSo we have two circular reference problems, with the viewmodel sitting in the middle. As a result, this application is running into memory consumption problems because WPF entities are being created and associated with some piece of data in the model, and these entities are never cleaned up until the program is terminated.p  pHow is this supposed to be handledp  pIt seems like an ownership graph needs to be defined, such that one or more of these components is responsible for disconnecting event handlers when they are no longer relevant, so that things can be GCd.p

Negative 46457 pI have an odd business requirement that has me stumped. Some background basically, I have two tables for tracking program enhancements Enhancement and Bug. The relationship for EnhancementBug is 1m, and the Bug table has a foreign key column EnhancementID. p  pBoth tables have a Status column, but this is where it gets tricky. My requirement is that the status of an Enhancement is dependent on its related Bugs. For example, if we have 3 Bugs with EnhancementIDs of 100 and Statuses of In Testing, then Enhancement 100s status should automatically be set to In Testing. There are several status rules like this.p  pThis database is shared by a few applications, so my first thought was to use an On Update trigger on the Bug table. Because the trigger had a Select statement in the triggering table, I received a mutating table error I have to query the statuses of all bugs with the specified EnhancementID when the trigger fires. Now, I am trying to implement a three trigger solution as outlined here a hrefhttpasktom.oracle.complsasktomASKTOM.downloadfilepfile6551198119097816936 relnofollowhttpasktom.oracle.complsasktomASKTOM.downloadfilepfile6551198119097816936a but I am becoming wary of putting so much logic within database triggers.p  pSo my question is am I approaching this problem reasonably Is there a better way someone could suggest Perhaps using a view for the Enhancements statusp

Negative 46457 pI moved a .js file from one folder to another manually. Now, although GIT seems to have the complete history log for the file, it still seems to treat the move as a deletecreate event.  Further, using git BLAME, I cannot go back to track changes beyond the point that I moved the file. p  pIts been a month or so and many commits since, but I would love to be able to repair that history so that GIT treats the entire commit history as the same file, without the cutoff point at the move.. and I would be able to step back using blame to track changes.p  pCan anyone help with thisp

Negative 46457 pIt appears some of my websites users are experiencing issues when attempting to insert values into input fields of type number with the step attribute set. p  pI am using Django 1.6 to render the forms to HTML.p  pThe number fields map to an underlying DecimalField model field with maxdigits25 and decimalplaces5p  pThis results in the following example html being rendered for the number fieldp  precodeltinput typenumber value step0.00001 namequantity ididquantitygt codepre  pThe step attribute I know is not yet supported in FireFox but is in Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE10p  pEverything works fine in all browsers except IE10 and IE11. In the above example the maximum range that can be entered is 227 to 227 in IE10 and IE11. If I try to enter a lower or greater value respectively than this I get a You must enter a valid value error and cannot submit the form.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comtagsattinputstep.asp relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comtagsattinputstep.aspa p  blockquote   pThe step attribute specifies the legal number intervals for an  element.p      pExample if step3, legal numbers could be 3, 0, 3, 6, etc.p blockquote  pSo in my users example they were attempting to enter 20000 as the value which failed in IE10 and IE11. If my calculations are correct 20000 falls correctly into an interval of 0.00001p  pA solution for me could be to remove the step attribute from all my forms that use a number field, either via the django forms or using javascript, but I think this would be a very messy solution and one that goes against the grain of HTML5.p  pHas anyone else encountered a similar problem, have I done something wrong or is this a bug in IE10 and IE11p  pAny thoughts, comments or answers welcome. In the meantime I will be forced into providing my usual solution to affected users by suggesting they use a browser that works.p

Negative 46457 pThe short version of my question is Im getting an error in Internet Explorer 8  how can I change my code to accomplish my task without hitting that errorp  pThe long version Ive got a website where some dynamicallygenerated pages have a save this page link at the top.  Clicking the link will launch a barebones version of the page content stripping out header and footer, etc in a smaller popup using javascripts window.open.  The poppedup page has menubar1, so that the user can use File  Save As... and save the page.  This is a pretty clumsy way to implement saving, but I couldnt find any nicer solutions with sufficiently wide browser compatibility.p  pThis works fine in every version of Chrome or Firefox Ive tested, and in IE9, IE10, and either of those browsers in compatibility mode for 7 or 8.  But users who actually have IE8 are seeing this behaviorp  ol liOn normal, prettystyled webpage, click save this page linkli liOn barebones popup, go to File  Save As...li liIn the Save dialog, select a location and click Saveli liObserve save progress bar get up to somewhere beyond 50, then disappear to be replaced with an error message, the title of which is Error Saving Webpage and the full text of which is This webpage could not be saved.li ol  pThis happens when saving as Webpage, complete or as Web Archive, single file.

Is there something in my code that would cause this, and that could be addressed by my fixing my code instead of needing to figure out a workaround from the users perspectivep  pstrongEdit to addstrong Sorry, I should probably have realized that some suggested answers would involve PHP.  This is a CASP.NET site.p  pstrongEdit 2strong The page being saved is dynamically generated, so it cant be requested directly from the server in any creative ways like wget.  Right now some AJAX magic happens to produce a string of HTML specifically a table, each row corresponding to a product on a particular product list that may have already been filtered by the user.  Then a popup is launched with window.open and document.write used to fill that popup with some head matter  the generated table  standard HTML tags like openclose head and body.  This document.writed popup is what needs to be saved.  The various strings I build up to stick in the document.write call are all made up of printable characters with a couple of minor exceptionsp  ul lin which was only added to the source to format it nicely for the folks hereli liAny nonprintable characters that might be in individual product titlespricesSKUs, pulled from the database which Im not sure how to check for, but which presumably arent in so many different product titles that I cant find one single list that prints correctly in IE8li ul  pUnless document.write itself is doing something hinky, I cant think of a way the written content could be the problem.

Negative 46457 pI was wondering how I can fix the problem Im currently having. Let me explain it I created a ListView with some strings. I used an onItemClick event which handles my click when I click on a certain item in the ListView. When I click Cocktails itll open the cocktails page, when I click desserts, itll open the desserts page. I used the position of the string in the array for this. so position 0  cocktails and position 1  desserts, and so on..p  pBut the problem appears when I use the search function. Because when I search for d the first item in the list will be desserts and when I click it it will open up cocktails, because I coded the 0th position to open up the cocktails page.p  pIs there a way for me to be able to not use position in the list, but refer the click to a string. Something like if ...  cocktails Intent i  new IntentMain.java, Cocktails.java... This way Im capable of hardcoding every string in the array to a certain page.p  pIs this possible If so, could you please help me Thanksp  pMy current code isp  precodepublic class Aperitiefhapjes extends Activity       private ListView lv  List view     ArrayAdapterltStringgt adapter  Listview Adapter     EditText inputSearch  Search EditText     ArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgt productList  ArrayList for Listview      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityaperitiefhapjes           Listview Data         String products[]  cocktails,desserts          lv  ListView findViewByIdR.id.lvaperitiefhapjes         inputSearch  EditText findViewByIdR.id.inputSearch           Adding items to listview         adapter  new ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, R.layout.searchlistitem, R.id.searchlistnaam, products         lv.setAdapteradapter            Enabling Search Filter         inputSearch.addTextChangedListenernew TextWatcher               Override             public void onTextChangedCharSequence cs, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3                   When user changed the Text                 Aperitiefhapjes.this.adapter.getFilter.filtercs                             Override             public void beforeTextChangedCharSequence arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                           Override             public void afterTextChangedEditable arg0                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                                registerClickCallback           public void registerClickCallback              ListView listListViewfindViewByIdR.id.lvaperitiefhapjes         list.setOnItemClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener               Override             public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View viewClicked, int position, long id                  0  cocktails                 ifposition  0                                      Intent i  new IntentAperitiefhapjes.this, Cocktails.class                     startActivityi                                        1  desserts                 ifposition  1                                      Intent i  new IntentAperitiefhapjes.this, Desserts.class                     startActivityi                                                codepre  pIm guessing the problem will have to be fixed in the registerClickCallbackmethod.p

Negative 46457 pI have faced with very strange behavior in listview android. I puts several ViewGroupsactually RelativeLayout into a ListView as its item. The ViewGroup has TextViews and ImageViews. I registered OnClickListener on the ImageViews in the ViewGroup. When I tabbed the ImageViews, The OnClickListener is called in delayed It was over than 2 seconds.. Sometimes, the OnClickListener is  never called unless I tabbed another view in a device. In that case, the method is called multiply and in burst.p  pI think it seems to be related to focus. But I can not find a solution. This strange behavior occurs in only Galaxy S3. It works fine in Galaxy S4.p  pMeanwhile, OnTouchListener works fine even in the case in Galaxy S3. It means that a touch event arrives the View in the ViewGroup. I can not understand why the OnClickListener is called delayed or in out of focus even it receives touch events in OnTouchListeners.p  precode1227 233151.203 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233151.268 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233151.278 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233151.278 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233153.333 DAbsListView19534 unregisterIRListener is called  1227 233153.433 DAbsListView19534 unregisterIRListener is called  1227 233153.518 Idebug19534 dofollow clicked222222222222 codepre  pIn above log, you can see 4 times touch event. But OnClickListener is call after 2 seconds from last touch event.p  pUPDATE I did reset my deviceGalaxyS3 by tabbing reset button which is shown when I pressed long a power button of my device. And I tested it again. But, It was same result.  However, Today, I powered off my device by seperation of a battery. And powered on. It works fine without any source code changes. Is there any difference between the reset by poweroff and softwarereset Anyway, It words good this time. I will report it again if the behavior occurs again next time.p  pUPDATE I figure out that this issue is happened in all android devices. I guess that it is related to drawing cache of ListView. I guess that ListView makes drawing caches for its child views in sometimes. I checked it out by enabling showing boundaries of all views in android system setting. After enabling showing boundaries, I navigates several items in ListView. Then, I saw some view of child of ListView does not have its child  layout boundary. It means that it is just image not a view. In that time, All controlsincluding ImageView does not work. After just little scrolling of the ListView, The queued click events are flushed to a child control at that time. It means that scrolling of ListView triggers changing of the cache image with the real view. I can not find a way turning off this drawing cache in ListView.p  pUPDATE I solved this issue. I feeds views created statically by myself instead of using convertView in getView method. In this case, something wrong is  happend inside of ListView. I changed it to use convertView always.p

Negative 46457 pIve built a platformer prototype using SpriteKit and I have a question which I havent seen answered anywhere, including official documentation.p  pSince Im starting to get impaired frame rates, I decided to remove nodes and readd them dynamically to my scene based on their distance essentially if they are offscreen or on from the players location. This seems to work fine and I can get 60fps. But this doesnt work the case of bodies that are jointed such as a rope bridge.p  pIm seeing exceptions during removal. Ive finally managed to fix this by walking each node.physicsBodys joints and removing those before removing the node itself. In restoring them, I originally though that nesting each bridge under a single SKNode was the answer but this doesnt help with the joints that are added to the SKPhysicsWorld. Ive played with using mutable arrays to hold onto everything but havent figured out how remove or reattach all the nodes as they are essentially a chain. My last thought it to try to subclass the joints so that I can mark which bridge they belong to and rebuild the entire bridge in one pass as any portion of it gets close to being onscreen.p  pThere must be an easier way to remove and rehydrate nodes with joints. Im probably missing something obvious. Any ideasp

Negative 46457 pI am new to parallel processing. I have read through High performance and parallel computing with R at CRAN. and have come to understand the difference between implicit and explicit parallelism and that of distributed computing vs embarransingly parallel problems and read about foreeach, multicore, snowfall,package doSMP retired from CRAN etcp  pI have windows as OS, unfortunatelly installing other OS is not an option.  p  pI would like to explain the structure of my code as to ask your opinion on the possibilities to implement parallel computing. Package used is caret. p  p13 of my code is to a large degree sequential and not possible to parallelize and 23 is mostly iterative with limited sequentiality results have to be communicated once at the end of the processes and some data has to be taken from prior sequential results to be used by the process, this corresponds to the training of a model embeded within a conditional expression below. can use from 2 to 10 folds and repetitions. p  precodetrainltrunifnrow Xlt0.80 folds2  repeats5 myControl lt trainControlmethodcv, numberfolds, repeatsrepeats,     returnResampnone, returnDataFALSE, savePredictionsTRUE, verboseIterTRUE,     allowParallelTRUE, indexcreateMultiFoldsY[train], kfolds, timesrepeats PP lt ccenter,scale   model1ltifModel1 0  trainX[train,], Y[train], methodbag, trControlmyControl,    preProcessPP else 0 codepre  pThe whole code has to be repeated 50 times with only X changing. p  pMy questions are below. p  ol lipWhat would be the options in respect to packages needed to implement parallel processing using multiple cores from a windows OS. rParallel seems to be one doSMP anotherpli lipGiven the explained structure of 23 the code which seems to be paralletizable, would you be of the opinion to run it as an embarrasignly parallel problem or opt for R serial loops given the few folds and repetitionspli lipHow would you approach repeating 50 times the same sequence of code with one minor change. In parallel or using simultaneously different R instances for example in baches. In this last case how would you combine the results of running multiple R instances.pli ol  pThank youp  pEDITp  pNote that the package doSMP is built into the core build of Revolution R, so you dont have to install it from CRAN for this reason, you wont find it on the package list. All you have to do is load it with requireSMP revoIPC package is also necesary. This package does no compile on modern versions of gcc and hence has been archived, doSMP depends on it and therefore went to the archives as well.

Negative 46457 pI have a series of task that accept data then when finished processing move it to a different task. p  pEach task has its own Executor Service initialized as p  precode int workerSize  Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors  2  executorService  new ThreadPoolExecutorworkerSize, workerSize,0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,new LinkedBlockingQueueltRunnablegt,                                           new SongKongThreadFactorythreadGroup codepre  pThe tasks work on files each file get put on taskA queue, then when processed by taskA it may be put on taskBs queue or straight onto taskC queue.p  pOne aim of this pipeline approach is that however many files you have the application doesnt use too much memory because only some files are being processed at any time, however each tasks has different throughput levels so Im finding that the task B queue is building up because files are processed more quickly by task A then task B. And these queues are using memoryp  pSo I changed executor servide defn to specify a amx size of the queue as followsp  precodeexecutorService  new ThreadPoolExecutorworkerSize, workerSize,0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,new LinkedBlockingQueueltRunnablegt100,                                               new SongKongThreadFactorythreadGroup codepre  pMy idea was that if task A tried to submit the 101 item then it would just wait until there was a space, so processing on task A would temporarily sleep and memory usage would be reduced. But instead the task just gets rejected with RejectedExecutionException .Ive since checked all the available ThreadExecutor policys and none just allow the calling process to wait.p  pSo i think I must be approaching this in the wrong way, how should I be doing this p  pIm currently using Java 7 and expect to move to Java 8 when released.p
Negative 46457 pHeres what am trying to do.p  pI was trying to insert the values from a certain table which has different columns to the other one. The name of the first table to which Im getting the said values was dbtable1.dbo.patient while the other to which Im inserting it was dbtable2.dbo.clients. Both has id to act as their primary key. However, most of the id from dbtable2.dbo.patient has NULL values, contrary to the second table which has an autoincremented values for its id. So, I did change the rows that has null into 0. Now, Im ready to run this syntax.p  precodeINSERT  INTO dbtable2.dbo.clients                    cid ,           lname ,           fname ,           mname ,           ctype ,           cadd ,           cpno                  SELECT  recid ,                 lname ,                 fname ,                 midname ,                 type ,                 address ,                 celno         FROM    dbtable1.dbo.patient codepre  pExample syntax is based on the actual design of both database.p  pHowever, I keep on having this error message indicating p  blockquote   pServer Msg 8152, Level 16, State 2, Line 1   String or binary data would be truncated.   The statement has been terminated.p blockquote  pI suspect that perhaps the reason why Im having this error is because Im trying to transport the values to a table that has an autoincremented column for ID. Well, thats for my own thinking. Or perhaps there could be another reason for this error to trigger. Like, the fact that I changed the values of the 1st table ID into 0 and since its against the rules for primary key inserting thus this error has poppedout.p  pI believe that if I could have a syntax that would increment the values of recid as Im running the insert into for cid, this error wont come out and I could have a lesser work for running the same expression for every rows.p  pWhat dyou guys thinkp

What if I have 100 panels to update Do I need to create 100 classes for each of the thread which updates a particular panel I want the threads to work independently of the other threads.

Negative 46457 pAll,p  pI hope most of you know that with ios7 there is not need to do a null check for tableview reusep  precodeif cell  nil  codepre  pBut unfortunately, because of that the cells are always reinitialized, as we put the code in the same method for initializing values. The problem is only with text fields inside the tableview though.p  pLet me explain the scenario. I have a table view with multiple rows, and some rows contain multiple text boxes. I populate the textboxes with data from server when the page is loaded. Since the cells are always reinitialized as i explained above, whatever I enter in the field goes away and the server data is re populated once i scroll down and come back to the initial stage. This is because the populating the data code is also in the same place. After fetching a reusable cell it populates the data.p  pPreviously till ios6, we used ifcellnil and hence we loaded server data inside the cell and when reusing the cell, this piece of code will never be called.p  pI have other dirty solutions, but would like to know if someone else has a graceful way of dealing this. Please help. p

Negative 46457 pI asked question the other day on this app after some good advice, I moved on and I now think this is a different issue. Before, I was not getting any display on the screenno errors or any console.logs. After working on it some more, I now have my modelview and some of my render function working. p  pI think the issue is with my template or with my append. Below is the full code as it stands now. There are comments where I think there maybe some issues.  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. p  pstrongEDIT strong Thanks for the advice Niranjan. I made some the changes you mentioned I took away the counter and sample data. With these new changes, my newsFeed.js is no longer being read and so I am unclear as to how to populate my collection. When I console.log out my collection I get an empty array with my defaults shown, but with the json file not being read in the first place how do I get anything to workp  pstrongEDIT2 strong Thank you again Niranjan. With the changes you suggested and a few of my own, I now have the code below. The issue I have right now, Is my array is being populated far too many times. the JSON file has 8 entries in total and because of my .each statement in my template it is looping 8 times where I only want it to loop once and then to split the array into separate entries. I tried first splitting it during my response parse but this didnt work, do you have any advice for thisp  pembelow the code is links to the live views of code and htmlbroswer content including a link to the JSON file.emp  pMy end goal is to click on one title and have the corresponding content show.p  precode        function              var NewsFeedModel   Backbone.Model.extend         defaults              title ,             content                     var NewsFeedCollection   Backbone.Collection.extend         model NewsFeedModel,         url  newsFeed.js,             parse functionresponse                  console.logcollection and file loaded              return response.responseData.feed.entries                        var NewsFeedView  Backbone.View.extend         el  .newsContainer ul,         template .templatefeedTemp.html,           initialize function           var scopeThis  this             .bindAllthis, render                  this.collection.fetch                     success functioncollection                         scopeThis.render                                                        this.collection.bind add,  this.render, this                 console.logView and Template read     ,       render function               this.el.htmlthis.template             feed this.collection.toJSON               console.logthis.collection.toJSON          var newsFeedCollection  new NewsFeedCollection       var newsFeedView  new NewsFeedView     collection newsFeedCollection   var title  newsFeedCollection.findtitle var content  newsFeedCollection.findcontent gt title   document.onclick, add, functiontitle, content       console.logI have been clicked       iftitle  content     console.logthey match          else     console.logthey dont match      .hide.slideToggleslow       codepre  pThis is my underscore template.p  precode   ltdiv classspan12gt ltscript idfeedTemp typetexttemplategt     lt .eachfeed, functiondata  gt         ltdiv id  titleContentgt           lta href id addgt lt data.title gt ltagt              ltdiv idcontent classhidegt                 lt data.content gt              ltdivgt         ltdivgt lt  gt ltscriptgt            ltdivgt codepre  pI am using google drive as a testing ground links for the full htmlcode. a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B0mP2FImEQ6qa3hFTG1YUXpQQm8edit relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B0mP2FImEQ6qa3hFTG1YUXpQQm8edita [code View] a hrefhttpsgoogledrive.comhost0B0mP2FImEQ6qUnFrU3lGcEplb2sfeed.html relnofollowhttpsgoogledrive.comhost0B0mP2FImEQ6qUnFrU3lGcEplb2sfeed.htmla [browser View] a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B0mP2FImEQ6qbnBtYnVTWnpheGMedit relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B0mP2FImEQ6qbnBtYnVTWnpheGMedita [JSON file]p

Negative 46457 pIve an xml element that takes in a number. Its optional. I created the JAXB POJO classes and the same tag is mapped to an int variable in Java. Now, as the xml element is optional, user may not set it at all, which would set the corresponding java variable to 0.   In some cases the user may set it and send in 0. Again, the java variable would be set to 0. I was wondering whether there is a way to differentiate these two scenarios programmatically. Thank youp

As you can see the 6 next to the Menu item Plugins has reappeared indicating that there are 6 plugins which require updating.p  pJetpack is one of those plugins. The update notification has not appeared next to the plugin itself, but the version number has remained the same. Updating it today, the version number should be 3.0.1p  pIm totally baffled by this one. Does anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 46457 pI am currently using Cocos2dx C version 2.0.1. I understand this is an older version of cocos2dx but I originally started using it and already made most of my game with it and I really would rather not switch versions at this time. The problem I am currently having is that my whole game has about 3 full songs, 6 sound effects, and LOTS of textures. I have about 4 sprite sheets using the .plist.pvr approach that have about 70 frames each. Now I feel I must be doing something wrong because I feel like so many games have way more data then this and they can load up just fine. I have tried many ways to make this work efficiently. I will describe each approach and the problems I have had with each.p  ol lipI made A load up screen on start of the application but I found out that there seems to be no way to load .plist.pvr asynchronously so I had no choice but to load each .PNG image one by one and no longer use sprite sheets. I feel that this is a ridiculous way but I have no found another solution. so by using this approach the game does load up it takes some time but it does work and since all images are preloaded the game runs smoothly. The problem here is that when I hit the home button and tap on my game icon to resume It takes a lot of time to reload all the textures and I have a very long wait before the application resumes. To fix this I have tried the following approach I learned about setPreserveEGLContextOnPause and how I can make textures not be lost when pressing home button. So I finally figured out how to set that up and it actually fixed the problem but I tested this with using only about a fourth of my sprites just to see how much memory it was using and I saw that it was already using 345MB of RAM This means my full game would probably make the phone run out of RAM.pli lipAfter all the mishap with the first approach I am really convinced I am doing something terribly wrong because I have not seen one android game that has trouble with coming back after hitting home button. I understand I am using many sprites but I can only but them down so much. I would love to go back to using the .plist.pvr approach but I cant seem to find a way to load these file types while presenting a loading screen.pli lipI have also tried just simply loading each thing per scenes init method. This causes the same time delay between switching scenes also.pli ol  pOverall I am really stuck. I feel like I must be doing something very wrong because my game is a very simple puzzle game that is not huge by any means. I also want to find a solution that will work for iphones as well as android phones. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks.p

This all works fine. Ive even tried logging codescope.trackscode, which is an array, and it is populated with the tracks matching the search result. According to the Soundcloud API reference, each track has a codetitlecode property. I tested this by doingp  pcodeconsole.logscope.tracks[0].titlecode, and I got a nice string with the title.p  pNow in my codengrepeatcode, which is written like sop  precodeltulgt     ltli ngrepeattrack in tracksgttrack.titleltligt ltulgt codepre  pI get several bullet points but they are all empty. In other words codetrack.titlecode doesnt exist Ive tested that this is a valid property. Additionally, I know that codescope.trackscode is being populated because there are indeed list items, but they are all empty. p  pThanks for any helpp  pEDIT I did some research on codengrepeatcode and learned that it watches for updates such as code.pushcode... should still not explain this weird behavior, but it might help identify the problem. p

Negative 46457 pSo I have built a couple web apps now and Im not sure if my authentication method is the most secure.  p  pI currently compare the usernamepassword combination to the AD account and if the authentication is successful it creates a session string that contains the user id. Then on page load for every page that requires you to be logged in checks that session string to see if it is null or has a value.  If it is null it redirects you to the log in page but if it is not null then it loads the page.  p  pMy question is if there is a better way to handle authentication than this  The way I have it currently built works but Im curious to see if there is a better way to handle this. p

Negative 46457 pI received a new Macbook Pro for work and started to setup my local machine for development.

Negative 46457 pHow can I report JavaScript errors that occur during test execution using a hrefhttptheintern.io relnofollowInterna Basically, if there are any JavaScript errors on the page even as part of things that arent explicitly tested I want to know.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm just getting started with Intern and testing in general and Im trying to test all major pages on my site in all browsers because I just changed all our JavaScript to load via require.js. While it looks good in Chrome, Ive had issues with require.js and random browsers in the past so I wanted to automate everything. The most likely issue that will arise is that some random JS will fail to execute due to asynchronous loading and load of an expected global. Since there are no current tests setup, I basically want to start by running a test go to through all major pages and report any JavaScript errors.p

Negative 46457 pWithin my Cognos 10.2 list report, I am using a Dynamic Cube as a source.  Based on the business requirments I am using a list rather than a crosstab to show specific OLAP data.p  pMy issue is that I need to create a column that uses the value of a cell within the row divided by the total of all such values in that column...for the level in the row.p  pOk so here is an examplep  precode    Col1 Row1  Red     Col1 Row2  Blue      Col2 Row1  40     Col2 Row2  50      Col3 Row1  .44     Col3 Row2  .55  Total for Col2 Rows 1amp2  90 codepre  pIn the example above, Col1 is a hierarchy and so I am able to drill updown thus changing the values of the columns to the right of it. p  pI am attempting to build Col3, which has the formula of Col2  TotalCol2.  The challenge is to get the correct Total value based on the edge value of Col1.  So while the example shows a total of 90, if I were to drill down on Red, then the total would be different..and thus would impact the value of Col3.p  pI created a List Summary item for Col2, and attempted to use that within a calculated data item in the list..but what is happening is that the total is not summarizing for all values only for the row.  So instead of seeing .44 I am seeing 1..which is dividing itself by itselfp  pSo...I believe the issue is that I need a way to summarize at each level of the hierarchy so that I can use that value in the calculation.  But I have not found a way as of yet...if anyone has any suggestions...i am listening p

Negative 46457 pSo I see that trees are usually implemented as a list where each node is dynamically allocated and each node contains pointers to two of its children. p  pBut a heap is almost always implemented or so is recommended in text books using an array. Why is that Is there some underlying assumption about the uses of these two data strcutures For e.g. if you are implementing a priority queue using a min heap then the number of nodes in the queue is constant and so it can be implemented using an array of fixed size. But when you are talkingteaching about a heap in general why recommend implemeting it using an array. Or to flip the question a bit why not recommend learnig about trees with an implementation using arrays p

Negative 46457 pI have a controller method in my services that calls an SSIS package that loads a data file into our database.  The beginning of the controller basically prepares my Load object that holds all the necessary information that the SSIS package needs, and then gives that object to a static handler that calls the stored procedure that in turn calls the SSIS package.  At the beginning of the static handler method, I insert a row into my log table, and after the package is complete I update that row with the status of the packages whether they fail or succeed, and the error message if it does fail. p  pWhat weve noticed is that on some random occasions, that package ends up running twice and even three times.  I checked the IIS logs and the call to my services is only called once.  The log row that is created is only created once, but certain methods towards the end of the method are actually being logged twice or three times.  This leads me to believe that for some reason and this is why Im posting this  part of my code is running twice.

Negative 46457 pI am developing a Universal App that uses the HTML5  JavaScript framework. In this app I have a page with an HTML audio tag with the attribute msAudioCategory set to BackgroundCapableMedia, that is further wired up with Windows.Media.SystemMediaTransportControls.getForCurrentView in order to get the audio playing in the background. I also have, on both the windows and phone projects, set the Declarations  Background Tasks  Audio, with the default.html page set as the entry page.p  pDeploying to Windows either local machine or emulator works as expected. All to the good. However deploying to either the phone emulator or a physical phone device throws this rather unhelpful errorp  precodeUnexpected Error Package could not be registered. Exception from HRESULT 0x80073CF6 codepre  pCant see any obvious reason for this. Searching the net suggests that this emmightem be a bug, but I also suspect that playing background audio on the phone might require a different methodology.p  pNotably, starting a new blank universal app, adding the declaration as above with no audio tag or supporting code, deploys on windows but fails with the same error on the phone. Any ideasp
Negative 46457 pId like to go further on what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9112900jacksonhowtopreventfieldserializationthis questiona was about, Ive been roaming SO for a solid hour now without finding anything.p  pBasically, what Im trying to do is having a property properly instanciated through Jackson internal reflection algorithm during deserialization but having this same property strongnotstrong serialized when it comes to serialization.p  pI know about codeJsonIgnorecode and codeJsonIgnorePropertiescode but apparently I cant seem to use them right  either my property is correctly deserialized when I feed Jackson a proper map of properties but it also appears in the serialized results, either when using codeJsonIgnorecode it is not serialized which is wanted but also not deserialized not wanted.p  pExample p  precodepublic class Foo        This is the property I want to be instanciated by Jackson upon deserialization       but not serialized upon serialization           private final Object bar  null      public Object getBar          return bar       codepre  pTo make things worse, as you can see, the property is final this is why Im keen on using Jackson reflection ability upon codeFoocode instanciation through deserialization. Ive read on potential solution about annotating the setter and the getter differently but Id like to keep this property final if possible. emIf not possibleem, Id settle for a nonfinal property.p  pI would appreciate answers not suggesting custom serializerdeserializer, my code base is currently free of such and if the solution could be of minimal impact, that would be perfect. Again, Im no Jackson expert so if what Im asking is not possible Ill obviously accept alternative answers.p  pIve also read a hrefhttpsgithub.comFasterXMLjacksondatabindissues95 relnofollowthis thread on githuba but none of the suggested ways of implementation have actually been implemented at the moment.p  pThanksp  hr  pEDIT  to make things clearerp  precodepublic class Foo       private final String bar  null      public String getBar          return bar           Override     public String toString          return bar         public void testMethod throws IOException          String json  barValue         ObjectMapper mapper  new ObjectMapper         Foo foo  mapper.readValuejson, Foo.class         System.out.printlnfoo  should have a bar property set to Value         System.out.printlnmapper.writeValueAsStringfoo  should return an empty JSON object  codepre

Negative 46457 pI am using Ubuntu 14.04 x64 on a machine with Intel Xeon CPU. and I am experiencing an strange behaviour. I have a Fortran code and a lengthy part of the calculation is parallel with OpenMP. With a smaller data set say less than 4000 everything works fine. However, when I test a data set with 90K elements, in the middle the calculation the number of threads used suddenly drops to 1 which obviously slows down the computation. p  pI did these checks already  Using OMPGETNUMTHREADS I monitor the number of threads during the process and it ramains the same even after system uses 1 thread.p  pI use a LAPACK routine for eigen value calculation inside the loop. I compiled the Lapack again on my system to make sure the libraries on my system do not do anything. p  pCan it be that the System changes the number of used threads from outside If so why Thank you.p

Negative 46457 pWe are using BuildBot in conjunction with Amazon EC2 to run nightly UI automation testing, and are running into an issue where some of the builders still show pending builds even though the buildslave finished successfully. p  pThis is an intermittent thing  it happens only to some of the builders, and different ones each time  and isnt impacting the runs its just annoying to have to go in and manually clear the pending builds each morning. When we only had 20 slaves running, it wasnt a huge issue, but we now have almost 100 running each night, so its becoming quite a chore.p  pHere is the basic process flowp  ul liScheduled task puts build request information into Amazon SQS queue.li liPython script listening on EC2 instance with buildbot installed picks up the message, sends the codesendchangecode command to buildbot to start the build, and sends the spot instance requests to Amazon.li liSpot instances spin up and call codebuildslave startcode to callback to the buildbot master.li liInstances pick up test information and report results using SQS queues.li liPython script listening on buildbot master instance logs the test results.li liSpot instances shut themselves down when the test queue is empty.li liBuilders emshouldem complete here, but some still show as pending.li ul  pI am looking for a way to either prevent the pending builds from sticking around or, failing that, a programmatic way of clearing them out.

Negative 46457 pI have a project built on Spring MVC  JPA  Hibernate. I am using entity graphs JPA 2.1 for defining which data to fetch from the database, like in the example below.p  precodeEntityGraphltCompanygt entityGraph  entityManager.createEntityGraphCompany.class entityGraph.addAttributeNodesreviews  MapltString, Objectgt hints  new HashMapltString, Objectgt hints.putjavax.persistence.loadgraph, entityGraph  Company company  entityManager.findCompany.class, companyId, hints codepre  pMy codeReviewcode entity has an association with a codeCompanycode entity codeManyToOnecode.p  pHere I simply fetch a codeCompanycode object with a populated codereviewscode collection. This works well in scenarios like the above. But what if I want to fetch all or some of the reviews of a given company That is, the codeReviewcode objects that are associated with a company with a given ID. I want a codeListltReviewgtcode instead of a codeCompanycode object with a codeListltReviewgtcode. This is just an example  basically I am looking for more flexibility than simply looking up an object based on a primary key. I can do it with HQL with no problem, but then I would have to write several similar queries depending on which data I need in a specific context.p  pThe codefindcode method on codejavax.persistence.EntityManagercode simply makes it possible to query for an object based on a primary key. But is it somehow possible to use entity graphs in more complicated scenarios, e.g. with Criteria objects or HQL queries For example, looking up objects with other conditions than by primary key  perhaps even conditions on associations.p  pI hope I made myself clear.

Negative 46457 pHeres the long issue, someone helping me would be VERY appreciated. Im taking over marketing for a company that has a terrible website thats tied into a ton of things they do making the location of its hosting mission critical.p  pstrongThe site is on IISstrong, which means installing WordPress at strongcompanyname.comblogstrong will present nothing but issues. What I would like to do is purchase external hosting, install WordPress, get the blog going etc, and then point companyname.comblog to this external hosting.p  pHeres the kicker, it has to still look as if its at companyname.comblog the entire time. So if theres a blog post, it has to be at companyname.comblogthisismyblogpost.p  pI figured this would be fairly simple, some sort of masking or something, but I cannot find any answers, tech help on the hosting side doesnt seem to understand the request. Obviously, if I could install WordPress on IIS with confidence, this wouldnt be an issue, but apparently itll run like crap.p  pHas anyone seen this before or does anyone have any idea how this can be achieved. I really just need companyname.comblog to show the contents of publicly visible web hosting but be a part of the wesite.p  pOh, and a subdomain is out of the question, because research shows it has way less of an affect on SEO than having the blog in a subdirectory.p  pThanks so much to the superhero who has an answer for me.p

Negative 46457 pI am new to .net programming. I have a custom control which implements ICallbackEventHandler. This control has dropdowns.  On one of these dropdowns I need a postback, since the entire page needs to be reloaded as per the value selected. I know ICallbackEventHandler is used to avoid postbacks. But is this conditional postback achievable I dont want to make changes to the control since it is an old code and used at many places. Hence I do not want to redesign the existing control and get rid of ICallbackEventHandler. Please suggest alternatives.p

Negative 46457 pstrongHI,strong first of all, Ive read a lot of posts about this but no one seems to work. I have a content slider made by me in jQuery. Im such a noob on this but after 1 hour it worked. The problem comes when you try to push the button which brings the next slide out several times rapidly.p  pstrongHeres how my code worksstrongp  pFirst I set a variable named count to be at 1000.p  pI have 4 content divs. I hide 3 of them. When the user clicks the next button, the variable checks if the value is 1000. If this is true, then I set the opacity to the first div to 0, hide the div and fadeIn the other one the div two. Then I set the variable count two 1001 and reset the opacity of div 1 it does not appear since its hidden. p  pIf at the first moment, the variable is not 1000 checks if its value is 1001 and so on. You get the pointp  pIts a little bit tricky but it works. All working right but when you hit the next button several times rapidly, all the animations mess up. Please if someone could told me how I fix this Ill be completely grateful.p  pstrongIf you want to see the slider go herestrong a hrefhttpwww.sinvenderse.comhgindex.htm relnofollowhttpwww.sinvenderse.comhgindex.htmap  pand scroll to the end of the page.

If I try to inject myself into that field on my codeThrottledSocketcode object, I run into this problemp  precode    File homealexdevjottalibsrcjottalibJFS.py, line 590, in request     r  self.session.geturl, headersextraheaders   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestssessions.py, line 394, in get     return self.requestGET, url, kwargs   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestssessions.py, line 382, in request     resp  self.sendprep, sendkwargs   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestssessions.py, line 485, in send     r  adapter.sendrequest, kwargs   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestsadapters.py, line 324, in send     timeouttimeout   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestspackagesurllib3connectionpool.py, line 478, in urlopen     bodybody, headersheaders   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestspackagesurllib3connectionpool.py, line 285, in makerequest     conn.requestmethod, url, httplibrequestkw   File usrlibpython2.7httplib.py, line 973, in request     self.sendrequestmethod, url, body, headers   File usrlibpython2.7httplib.py, line 1007, in sendrequest     self.endheadersbody   File usrlibpython2.7httplib.py, line 969, in endheaders     self.sendoutputmessagebody   File usrlibpython2.7httplib.py, line 829, in sendoutput     self.sendmsg   File usrlibpython2.7httplib.py, line 791, in send     self.connect   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestspackagesurllib3connection.py, line 95, in connect     sslversionresolvedsslversion   File usrlocallibpython2.7distpackagesrequestspackagesurllib3util.py, line 643, in sslwrapsocket     sslversionsslversion   File usrlibpython2.7ssl.py, line 487, in wrapsocket     ciphersciphers   File usrlibpython2.7ssl.py, line 241, in init     ciphers TypeError must be socket.socket, not ThrottledSocket codepre  pNow what Is there somewhere else in this where I could ratelimit the python communication Or is there a cleaner way to do it than having to override the socket implementation Which turns out to be moot anyway, since the codesslcode package just tries to bypass it altogether.p

Negative 46457 pThe interface com.liferay.portal.security.auth.Authenticator of liferay contains different prototypes of different kinds of authenticate.

Negative 46457 pWe want to do Big Data Analytics on our data stored in Amazon Redshift currently in Terabytes, but will grow with time.p  pCurrently, it seems that all our Analytics can be done through Redshift queries and hence, no distributed processing might be required at our end but we are not sure if that will remain to be the case in future.p  pIn order to build a generic system that should be able to cater our future needs as well, we are looking to use Apache Spark for data analytics. I know that data can be read into Spark RDDs from HDFS, HBase and S3, but strongdoes it support data reading from Redshift directlystrong If not, we can look to transfer our data to S3 and then read it in Spark RDDs.p  pstrongMy question is if we should carry out our Data Analytics through Redshifts queries directly or should we look to go with the approach above and do analytics through Apache Sparkstrong Problem here is that Data Locality optimization might not be availablep  pIn case we do analytics through Redshift queries directly, can anyone strongplease suggest a good Workflow Schedulerstrong to write our Analytics jobs with.

Negative 46457 pIve been trying to switch to Python3. Surprisingly, my difficulty is not with modules or my own code breaking. My issue is that I am always trying and testing different aspects of my code in IPython as I write it, and having generators by default makes this infuriating. Im hoping there is either a gap in my knowledge or some sort of work around to resolve this.p  pMy issues arep  ul lipWhenever I test a few lines of code or a function and get a generator, I have no idea whats inside since Im getting a response like this codeltgenerator object ltgenexprgt at 0x0000000007947168gtcode. Getting around it means I cant just run code directly from my editor  I need to dump the output into a variable andor wrap it in a list.pli lipOnce I do start to inspect the generator, I either consume it fully or partially which messes it up if I wish to test it further. Partially consuming is especially annoying, because sometimes I dont notice and see odd results from subsequent code.pli ul  pOddly enough, I keep finding that I am introducing bugs or extraneous code, not because I dont understand lazy evaluation, but because of the mismatch in what Im evaluating in the console and whats making its way into my editor slipping through my view.p  pOff the top of my head, Id like to do one of the followingp  ul liConfigure IPython in some way to force some kind of strict evaluation unless I shut it off explicitlyli liInspect a generator without consuming it or maybe inspect it and then restart itselfli ul

Negative 46457 pstrong1. Some infostrongp  pI have an AngularJS 1.3.15 clientside app making requests to my loopback api.p  pIn the app, I intercept request results with httpProvider.interceptors and interpret the status codes to display meaningful messages when the user does something  for example I intercept 401 responses telling the user he doesnt have authorization, 200 for when he saves something successfully and so on.p  pstrong2. The problemstrongp  pFor example if the user tries to upload an image thats too big, the request payload will exceed my remoting limit and I am able to intercept a requestError but the status code always shows 0. Looking at the browsers console I see thisp  precodePUT httplocalhost3000apiModulesid9 413 Request Entity Too Large XMLHttpRequest cannot load httplocalhost3000apiModulesid9. No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin httplocalhost is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 413. codepre  pThe problem is that if the server is offline, I also get status code 0 when intercepting requestError, so theres no way for me to distinguish an error connecting to the server between an error sending too much data.p  pIs there any chance theres an issue with the express router middleware I cant seem to find anyone thats having the same problem...p

Negative 46457 pIm developing a datastore plugin to codeGeoservercode, to develop it faster I am trying to remote debug it. codeGeoservercode uses codeTomcatcode behind the curtains. I prepared everything to remote debug via codeEclipsecode and accomplished it. Now I can remote debug my plugin. However, when I modify my code I tried to add a harmless line like codeint noHarm  5code and then export it as jar and copy that jar to codewebappslibcode under codeGeoservercode installation directory, I fail to remote debug the plugin. After that I changed that modification back to when it was workeddeleted codeint noHarm  5code and created the jar again, then copied it under codewebappslibcode , now I am able to remote debug again.p  pWhen I open stores page in codeGeoservercode, it stops at breakpoints in the codecanProcesscode method with the jar exported from not modified code or when I try to add new Store it stops at breakpoints in the codecreateDataStorecode method with the jar exported from not modified code. But if I change even a tiny line or add it wont stop at breakpoints even though it connects to virtual host succesfullyI use codevmware workstationcode with windows 732 bit on it if it helps.p  pWhat could be the problemp  pThanks very much in advance.p

Negative 46457 pI have written a crawl spider within a scrapy project that properly scrapes data from a url and the pipelines the response into a postgresql table, but only when the emscrapy crawlem command is used. When the spider is run from a script in the root directory of the project, it appears that only the parse method of the spider class is being called as the table is not being created upon running the script simply using the python command. I think the problem is that the crawl command has a specific protocol for looking for and calling specific modules in the directory above the spiders package e.g. the models, pipelines, and settings modules which arent being called when the spider is run from a script.p  pI followed the directions included in the a hrefhttpdoc.scrapy.orgenlatesttopicspractices.html relnofollowdocsa but they dont seem to address pipelining data after it is scraped. This raises the question of I should even be trying to run a script to run the spider or if I should just use the scrapy crawl command somehow. The problem is, I planned to run the scrapy spider from a django project when the user submits text in a form which lead me to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21523281usingscrapycommandcrawlfromdjangothis SO posta, but the provided answer doesnt seem to be addressing the my problem. I would also need to pass the text from the form to be added to the spider url  I was previously just using rawinput to create the url. How should I properly go about running the spider I have the code for the script and the spider below if they are needed.

I am also sure that all needed modules like mod proxy are enabled, i searched through fedora 20 documentation and checked server status, they are by default included and enabled.

It did not help at all.p  pI also have read the blog where someone claimed that problem may be that i am only including proxy routing to port 3000 and i did not create a rule for regular php to be displayed.

Negative 46457 pSo I am pretty new to image processing, I was reading through some image demosaicking and saw that there are CYGM Cyan Yellow Green Magneta color filter arrays. I was wondering after using that CFA how do you convert that to an RGB image, or does it convert to some other color space like CMYK I mean I can understand bayer filters, once you get the light on bayer pattern you can interpolate R G and B mosaics and use the values as the resulting RGB image, but I cant quit get how CYGM is used. p  pthanks.p  pthanks.p

Negative 46457 pIve been playing around with the twitteR R package the past few days, and am running into a error using direct messaging.  I wrote the following short script, basically just to see if I could effectively remote control R by sending direct messages to an account it monitors and then executing whatever code was in the block corresponding to it, along with sending me a response.  And it works  Sometimes.  Here is the codep  precode Loads libraries  librarytwitteR libraryRCurl libraryROAuth librarybase64enc libraryhttr libraryRJSONIO   Declare Twitter API Credentials apikey lt X  From dev.twitter.com apisecret lt X  From dev.twitter.com token lt X  From dev.twitter.com tokensecret lt X  From dev.twitter.

The keys and tokens portion is obviously replaced with my own and my twitter account is not USER123.  p  pThe problem is, usually after about 1 or 2 exchanges with R, I receive the following messagep  precode Error in twInterfaceObjdoAPICalldirectmessagesnew, params  params,      client error 403 Forbidden  codepre  pIt is inconsistent in how long it takes.

Negative 46457 pOur team used the gulpangular generator with yeoman to scaffold out our web app. It uses browsersync to handle live reloads, which we want. However, we just deployed to our development server, and now when two developers are using the gulp serve command at the same time, they both are shown the same window i.e. one developer types on one window, it shows up in the other developers window as well. I believe this is due to BrowserSyncs crossdevice testing capabilities, however I am at a loss for how to disable this feature. If anyone knows how to do this preferably without disabling our livereload functionality please let me knowp  pBelow is the code for my server.js file in the gulp folder, which is the same as the one that comes with the gulpangular generator, so hopefully this will help some people.p  precodeuse strict  var path  requirepath var gulp  requiregulp var conf  require.conf  var browserSync  requirebrowsersync var browserSyncSpa  requirebrowsersyncspa  var util  requireutil  var proxyMiddleware  requirehttpproxymiddleware  function browserSyncInitbaseDir, browser    browser  browser  undefined  default  browser    var routes  null   ifbaseDir  conf.paths.src  util.isArraybaseDir ampamp baseDir.indexOfconf.paths.src  1      routes         bowercomponents bowercomponents            var server       baseDir baseDir,     routes routes            You can add a proxy to your backend by uncommenting the line bellow.

Negative 46457 pHow I understand what is WAL Write Ahead Log provides consistent putdelete operations. All operation is written to it before making change in region. If something goes wrong with the region server we can repair information from WAL.p  pWhat I didnt understand is how WAL is implemented on top of HDFSp  pFrom HDFS documentation p  blockquote   pA client request to create a file does not reach the NameNode   immediately. In fact, initially the HDFS client caches the file data   into a temporary local file. Application writes are transparently   redirected to this temporary local file. When the local file   accumulates data worth over one HDFS block size, the client contacts   the NameNode. The NameNode inserts the file name into the file system   hierarchy and allocates a data block for it. The NameNode responds to   the client request with the identity of the DataNode and the   destination data block. Then the client flushes the block of data from   the local temporary file to the specified DataNode. When a file is   closed, the remaining unflushed data in the temporary local file is   transferred to the DataNodep blockquote  pSo its possible to loose WAL content if I made a small change and its content isnt forwarded to hdfs yetp  pstrongEDITstrong As I understand from a hrefhttphadoophbase.blogspot.com.by201205hbasehdfsanddurablesync.html relnofollowhttphadoophbase.blogspot.com.by201205hbasehdfsanddurablesync.htmlap  pwe could force  hdfs client to sync data without waiting it became equal to block size.p

Negative 46457 pSo Ive created a simple class to insert an event into the users default calendar app. We want this feature to happen in the background in our app, we do not want to insert events via Intents.p  pAfter looking around a bit I saw that since ICS, there was a new Calendar API available that enabled you to do this. Following a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsproviderscalendarprovider.html relnofollowGoogles Tutoriala I was able to get things set up, but for some reason Im not seeing the event show up on the Nexus 5s stock calendar app.p  pI even downloaded a couple 3rd party calendar apps and still nothing.

Negative 46457 pSo I have multiple intranet website projects in one solution. All .net 4.6 MVC 5. One of those projects is a Global project housing all stylesheets and css files that apply across the Intranet. Bootstrap, jQuery, etc As well as several universal apps that deal with the other stuff Email queueing, Security, etc p  pI have been investigating the bundling feature again. I ditched it originally because it was across projects and it didnt like it. However Ive started looking again, and I love the minification only on release mode and separate files in debug mode  great. However across project I have to reference the bundles with a url which always minify and are cached to the point where the project needs rebuilding to update the css. This is playing havoc with my attempts to update styles and expect it to work with BrowserLink.p  pId rather not go back to an ugly list of links that change with debug mode or not, is there a way of bundling files from another project in the same solution, or from another URL in release modep
