Positive 5871 pSo, Im fairly new to C but I have done lots of C programming.  Partly as an exercise, and also partly because I dont have a matrix package that permits the finegrained control over things that I would like, I have been writing my own matrix class mtMatrix and overloading various operators to let me write equations conveniently.  Ive overloaded ,,, and  to perform elementwise arithmetic operations, after checking that the matrices are of the same size, while fullon matrix multiplication is done by the class method Mult.  Ive further overloaded ,,, and  to multiply matrices by scalars, so I can have a mtMatrix M and write mtMatrix T  M  2.0 to get a new matrix whose entries are twice as large as the old one.  However, when I try to write mtMatrix T  2.0  M I run into problems, and Im not sure how I would write the overloading for ,, and  to accomplish this, even though what I would want is precisely the same result as if I were to type mtMatrix T  M  2.0. It seems that the contents of the overloading function would be identical in the two cases, but the signature of the function would be different.  Can anyone point me in the right directionp

Positive 5871 pI have a difficult at least for me  question about operator overloading with using traits.p  pLets image a situation when you dont have a direct access to the class definition and to any member functions of this class. But there is some helper class with all necessary helper functions for working with it. I use it as a realization of some unified interface for working with similar objects but with different and in some cases by using external libs unknown for me internal behavior.p  pIn particular for my case I talk about matrices. When for example I want to have some matrix class in my program Im just writing an interface for this class and it works fine.p  pThe problems start when I tried to generalize all my interfaces for different matrix class by adding some general interface.p  pLets look on examplep  precodetemplatelttypename Traitsgt class MatrixAlgebra public Traitsmatrixpolicyt, describe how to create matrix from pointer public Traitsmatrixalgebrat describe operations with references to matrices  private   typedef typename Traitsmatrixt matrixt   typedef typename Traitsmatrixreft matrixreft   typedef typename Traitsmatrixptrt matrixptrt   typedef typename Traitsmatrixpolicyt matrixpolicyt   typedef typename Traitsmatrixalgebrat matrixalgebrat public   explicit MatrixAlgebraconst matrixpolicytamp mp   matrixpolicytmp this is necessary because every matrix type has its own policy class    friend matrixt operatorconst matrixreft m1, const matrixreft m2     matrixptrt res0 doesnt work     matrixpolicytmatrixcreateres doesnt work     resmatrixalgebramatrixaddm1,m2 doesnt work      return res     codepre  pAs you see there are a lot of problems with operator overloading. This is because an operator overloading is a friend function.

Negative 5871 pIve created a simple project with an SQL Server database with dozens of tables and plenty of indices but nothing really complicated. No triggers, no stored procedures, no additional database magic.

So Ive made a setup through Visual Studio and sent it over to the typing Monkeys and their administrator.

Negative 5871 pIve been working with AS3 a lot over the last weeks and Ive run into a situation that google hasnt been able to help with. The crux of the problem is that before I run a function I need to know that certain conditions have been met, for example loading my config.xml and putting it into a class variable. Where I run into trouble is that URLLoader is async so I cant put code after the load, the only thing I can do is put it in a lambda on the listener. p  precodevar confObject  new Object  var ldrURLLoader  new URLLoader ldr.addEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, geoLoader, false, 0, true ldr.loadnew URLRequesthttpipinfodb.comipquery.php  function geoLoader eEventvoid      var data  new XMLe.target.data      conf.zip     data.ZipPostalCode.toString     conf.city    data.City.toString     conf.state   data.RegionName.toString  codepre  pOr slightly more concisely and I believe more understandablep  precodevar confObject  new Object  var ldrURLLoader  new URLLoader ldr.addEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, function eEvent     var data  new XMLe.target.data      conf.zip     data.ZipPostalCode.toString     conf.city    data.City.toString     conf.state   data.RegionName.toString , false, 0, true ldr.loadnew URLRequesthttpipinfodb.comipquery.php codepre  pThis worked great for short bits of code, but Ive got a bunch of functions that are relying on huge amounts of preconditions this pollutes the namespace if I use the first method or functions that rely on one bit of the stack which means that I cant use the second method even though its slightly more obvious to me. p  pSo, my question is How do flash professionals handle preconditions Im trying to find a solution that allows tons of preconditions as well as a solution that allows different orders of preconditions or just a few preconditions from a group. p  pEdit Im not sure I made it clear originally but the problem is that Ill have 5 preconditions which means that I end up with 5 of the above blocks. As you can imagine having 5 nested listeners makes for terrible spaghetti code. An example, one of my functions needs to know when the config.xml is loaded, when the location is updated, when the current weather conditions have been loaded, and when the images for the current weather have been loaded. However there is another function that needs to know only when the config.xml is loaded and the location is updated. So its a really complicated set but Im sure that Im not the only one out there thats had to deal with a complex set of events.p  pAlso worth noting, I have looked at Senoculars Sequence.as but to the best of my understanding thats based on returns rather than events. But I could be wrong about this. p  pThanks for any help you can offerp

It seems a little quirky to me to do it this way, so what would be a better methodp  pThis is the weird part, the exception Im getting is not from file IO at all, its from a library called CommStudio. In short, I dump the file to a string, i modify it slightly, dump it into a memory stream, and ship it off over ymodem on rs232. The exception is telling me the remote system has canceled. The device getting the data reports that there was a transmission error, which usually means that an incompleteempty file was received.p  pNormally I would blame the library on this, but it works flawlessly at desktesting and when there is only one process accessing the file. The only thing that really seems to be consistent is that it is likely to fail when multiple processes are accessing a file.p

I have strongDatejsstrong imported for use in another part of the project, so I hadnt realised that Datejs defines a codeDate.parsecode method which was overriding the standard JavaScript method. p  pAnyway, it turns out that Datejs has a weird bug which means it doesnt handle dates beginning with A properly.

Negative 5871 pI am working with a Microchip dsPIC33FJ128GP802. Its a small DSPbased microcontroller, and it doesnt have much power 40 million instructions per second. Im looking for a way to render a convex i.e. simple polygon. I am only dealing with 2D shapes, integer math, and set or clear pixels i.e. 1 bit per pixel. I already have routines for drawing fast horizontal and vertical lines writing up to 16 pixels in 88 cycles, so I would like to use a scanline algorithm. p  pHowever, all the algorithms I have found seem to depend on division which takes 18 cycles on this processor and floating point math which is emulated in software and so is very slow it also takes up a lot of ROM, or assume that I have a large amount of memory. I only have 2K left, 14K is used for graphics RAM of my 16K. So does anyone know of any good, embedded machine algorithms they can point me to with a simple C or pseudocode implementation which I can implement in assembly Preferably on the net, I dont live near any good bookstores with many programming books.p  pThanks. p  pEDIT Clarification, this is a polygon filling algorithm Im looking for. I can implement a polygon outline algorithm using Bresenhams line drawing algorithm as Marc B suggests.p  pEDIT 2 I wanted to let everyone know I got a basic algorithm up in Python.

Negative 5871 pWed like to stream h.264 video to a browser based on frames generated on the server. The frames would be synthetic, i.e. not coming from another real movie, mpeg, etc. Wed be generating them separately as part of a simulation, potentially using OpenGLDirectX to render individual frames. In my naive approximation, wed have a bitmap set aside in memory, render to it, tell the encoder to do its business, and repeat. The end user would see a continuously streaming video.p  pIm aware of several nonGPL softwarebased h.264 encoders, e.g. Intel IPP, but understand that these are often not capable of h.264 compression in real time. In an ideal world, our movies would be several megapixels, e.g. two HD TVs. I understand we need dedicated hardware for that. Are people aware of expansion cards, speciallyconnected servers, etc. that are capable of thisp

User input is not persisted to the database until they explicitly click a save button at some stage in the conversation. Until then, their input is retained in the codeHttpSessioncode object. If their session expires, the user must be directed to a page that informs them of the session expiry.  p  pThis is working fine except for a problem with the redirect. When a user allows their session to sit idle for longer than the time defined in codeltsessiontimeoutgtcode, the session expires as expected. However, my attempt to redirect the user to a simple Your session has expired page seems to have backfired. The redirect works alright, but unless the user closes all the open browser windows on their desktop not just the ones that were open to my web app page they will continue being redirected to the session expired page forever.  p  pHere are my constraintsp  ul liClient workstations use Internet Explorer. This is companywide and will not change anytime soon.li liUsers will have mulitple instances of IE open on their desktop as part of their normal workflow. Telling them to close all instances of IE is not acceptable.li liNot using any AJAX components in this web appli ul  pIve implemented the redirect with a Java Servlet codeFiltercode. Here are the relevant code snippetsp  precodeOverride public void doFilter         ServletRequest request,          ServletResponse response,         FilterChain filterChain          throws IOException, ServletException      Validate.notNullfilterConfig     Validate.isTruerequest instanceof HttpServletRequest     HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest  HttpServletRequest request     String requestedSessionId  httpServletRequest.getRequestedSessionId     logger.inforequestedSessionId   requestedSessionId     HttpSession httpSession  httpServletRequest.getSessionfalse      if requestedSessionId  null           No need to do anything here if no session exists yet         logger.debugNo session exists yet         filterChain.doFilterrequest, response      else          if httpSession  null              Validate.isTrueresponse instanceof HttpServletResponse             HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse                  HttpServletResponse response             handleSessionExpired                 httpServletRequest,                 httpServletResponse          else              if logger.isDebugEnabled                  logger.debugSession OK  requested URL                        httpServletRequest.getRequestURL.toString                                  filterChain.doFilterrequest, response                              private void handleSessionExpired         HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest,         HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse          throws IOException      logger.warnexpired session  id            httpServletRequest.getRequestedSessionId     String expirationPageURL           httpServletRequest.getContextPath             SessionExpiredNotification.html     httpServletResponse.sendRedirectexpirationPageURL  codepre  pThe codeSessionExpiredNotification.htmlcode page is meant to be the end of the line. The user should close this browser window and open a new one if they want to start a new conversation.

Negative 5871 pI have a rails application that serves as an interface to a hybrid of data. Most of the information I require is retrieved from the commandline program using XMLRPC. Aside from this, I require some additional bit of data which I have no option but to store in a database. For this reason, I am having trouble figuring out what would be the best way to design the application.p  pI have overridden codeself.allcode and codeself.findidcode such that they rely on calls to codesupercode and then enrich the object by defining its instance variables to the appropriate data retrieved from the program using XMLRPC.p  pThis all seems pretty convoluted though. For example, I imagine I have lost the ability to use the magic finders codefindbyxcode, and I dont know if anything else will break as a result of this.p  pMy question is if there is a more logical and sensible way of going on about doing this. That is, designing an application that depends on XMLRPC for its data for the most part, but also some data stored in a database.p  pI did read about codeafterfindcode. Using this callback, I can implement the object enriching process and have it run anytime there is a found record. However, my method of retrieving data associated with an item is different than that of retrieving emallem item data. The way I do it for retrieving emallem item data codeself.allcode is way more efficient, but unfortunately not applicable, to retrieving only emoneem items data codeself.findcode. This would work well if there were a way I could make the callback not apply to codeself.allcode calls.p

Now everyone else working on the project will get the update at their next codesvn upcode or codegit pullcode. One thing that is not nice is that the old folder in src will remains if it contains some pyc file in it, this can easily be avoided by removing all pyc before updating your local copy.p  pstrongUpgrading a pythononly dependency with PIPvirtualenvstrongp  pYou commit a new version of the requirements file, hopefully everyone working on the project notice the new version when they update their local copy and they then run codepip install E projectfoovenv r requirements.txtcode. p  pstrongEditstrong I remove the use of U with pip, this is not needed with pip 8.2p  pstrongEditstrong The only advantage on pipvirtualenv over my current approach seems to be when you work on different projects requiring differents version of python.

The only solution I can think of for that situation is using different virtual machines.p  pstrongSo what am I missing Can someone point me to a use case where PIP or virtualenv would be better than what Im doingstrongp

Negative 5871 pA common UI pattern is to display text in the status bar that is related to the currently selected menu item.p  pIn the past I have achieved this in winforms by creating an extender provider that adds a string property with the custom text for each menu item to be displayed in the statusbar. This was achieved by adding event handlers to the emMenuStripsem  emMouseEnterem and emMouseLeaveem events to display and remove the text.p  pThe problem I am having is that I am now using a MainMenu control instead of a MenuStrip and since it doesnt derive from Control it doesnt have emMouseEnterem and emMouseLeaveem events. p  pThe MainMenu has a Click event which means that I can display my text on the statusbar but as far as I can see there is no way to detect when the mouse has left the menu item and remove the text from the statusbar.p  pMy question is how can I implement this UI pattern using the MainMenu control Specifically I would like to know how to detect when the mouse has left the menu item so that the text can be removed from the statusbar. p  pNote The MenuStrip control is not an option as it doesnt use the operating system look and feel and I am trying to make my application fit in with this as much as possible.p

Negative 5871 pI read the MSDN article on the topic. To quotep  blockquote   pBecause a service must be run from   within the context of the Services   Control Manager rather than from   within Visual Studio, debugging a   service is not as straightforward as   debugging other Visual Studio   application types. To debug a service,   you must start the service and then   attach a debugger to the process in   which it is running. You can then   debug your application using all of   the standard debugging functionality   of Visual Studio.p blockquote  pNow my problem is that my service fails to start in the first place. First it crashes, and says p  blockquote   pAn unhandled exception   System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException   occurred in MyServiceName.exe[3596] p blockquote  pand suggests me to debug it the debugger instance instantly crashes when I choose one.

Negative 5871 pI am new to Windows IIS and I need to run a phpmysql application on it. For local php development on windows, I have found WAMP to be the easiest. p  pBut can WAMP be used in this case instead of installing php and mysql separately p  pThis needs to be done on an ec2 Windows 2003 instance. So far, I have already tried installing WAMP and setting up apache to listen on port 8080 instead of 80. From inside the remote desktop, both IIS and WAMP work properly in parallel on their respective ports. p  pHowever, when I try to connect from another computer using the ip address codehttp184...code, IIS works fine serving the default web page but cannot connect to apache on codehttp184...8080code. p  pIs it possible to use WAMP at all for this purpose and if yes, would there be any disadvantages in using it instead of installing phpmysql seperately p  pstrongEditstrong  p  pI dont know if this is a problem of blocked 8080 port. To verify this I stopped IIS and configured apache to listen to 80. Even then codehttp184...code doent show the WAMP homepage. IS anything needed to be configured in IIS p  h2RESOLVED h2  pAdded the port 80 in Windows Firewall Exceptions and it started working.  Also, its necessary to select Put Online in the WAMP tray otherwise it gives a forbidden response as suggested by some answers.p  pThanksp

Negative 5871 pI looked through the site at all the common posts but my question differs slightlyp  pWhat is the best practice for packing a simple Java application that has many other jar files as dependenciesp  pFor example I have foo.java with a main in it, and foo1.java, foo2.java that are accessed from foo.java. And I am using log4j.jar, mysql.jar on my eclipse build path. p  pRight now I am using ant, which works well to build it. And what I do is write a simple .sh script that references all the classpath and log4j info. But this means I have to give them all those jars and they have to be in the right location. I want to be able to say java jar foo.jar and have it run on any machine without having to transfer any other files. p  pMaybe a .jar is not the best way to go. I just want to be able to give one file to someone, who does not know how to setup a class path and everything, and have it able to run.p  pAlso I am curious as to what the best practice is. Do you usually just give someone a jar and give them a zip of all the dependency jars and tell them to put it on the class pathp  pDo you somehow make a .rpm p  pI am not familiar with MAVEN, but if that is the best way, I will do a tutorial. Right now I use ant.p

Negative 5871 pSo I have done a few minor things with web services and had some success, but when I attempted to tinker around with some stuff for fun I was encountering what I believe is me incorrectly parsing out the data to get the information that I need.  I can get the entire xml as a string but not just the 3 programs that I need.  The getPrograms and getInstitutions are similar enough that if I can get the programs part parsed right I can get the institutions.  Where I am getting confused is what I believe is the tags and how much they differ from any tutorials to what I am actually using.  I also went the way of the XmlPullParser but do not know if this is the best way about doing this is it. The format of what I am accessing is as followsp  precodeltDataSetgt ltxsschema idNewDataSetgt ltxselement nameNewDataSet msdataIsDataSettrue msdataUseCurrentLocaletruegt ltxscomplexTypegt ltxschoice

Negative 5871 pFolks,p  pWhen I get a new PC, I always first partition my disk into C, D and E  then install Windows on C, other software on D, and use E for my own work.  To make my installs easier, I first change the registry location of  ProgramFilesDir HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionProgramFilesDir to DProgram Files.  Once I do this, all new installations go to  DProgram Files. Life was good.p  pNow I have Windows 7. I see that the Registry includes all these entries now...p  precodeCommonFilesDir CommonFilesDir x86 CommonW6432Dir ProgramFilesDir ProgramFilesDir x86 codepre  pBy the time Windows 7 was installed, the two CommonFiles directories already had stuff installed. I decided to leave these untouched.  The rest I changed to their Ddrive equivalents.p  pSo two issues...p  pFirst, new software installs STILL want to go to CProgram Files.  I always have to change the C to a D  which Ive never had to do before.  Yes, Ive rebooted plenty since making the registry change.p  pSecond, Im finding that Visual Studio 2010 seems especially confused by this.  I have installed .NET 4.0, and even tried repairing it, but VS 2010 insists I dont have 4.0 installed.  Ive heard that others have this trouble, too, and VS 2010 seems to really want to be on the Cdrive.p  pAny help, dear friends, with either issuep

Negative 5871 pIm using the a hrefhttpipython.scipy.orgmoin relnofollowIPython shella here.p  pSuppose I have two listsp  precodeIn [1] L1  [1,3,4,5,2]  In [2] L2  [1,3,5,5,1] codepre  pId like to say that codeL1code and codeL2code are compatible in the sense that the ordering generated by the emindicesem of the increasing order of the elements are compatible.  p  pThat is, codeL1code gives 0lt4lt1lt2lt3 while codeL2code gives 0,4lt1lt2,3.  If stackoverflow accepted jsmath or MathJax, this would be easier, my apologies.  p  pEdit As pointed out below, this is not exactly checking whether two given elements are lt or lt in both of these.  I like Cosmologicons example that code[1,2]code and code[1,1]code are compatible, as are code[1,1]code and code[2,1]code, but code[2,1]code and code[1,2]code are not.  I hope this clarifies what I mean.p  pSo Id like a way to take two lists and check that the not necessarily strict total orders given by those two lists are compatible like this.  Here is an example where they are not.p  precodeIn [3] L3  [1,2,3,4,5]  In [4] L4  [1,2,4,2,5] codepre  pI hope it is clear the order given by codeL3code is 0lt1lt2lt3lt4 the order given by codeL4code is 0lt1,3lt2lt4, and the incompatibility is that while 1lt3 in both orders, 2lt3 in one of the while 3lt2 in the other.  p  pAnother, harder, example is whether code[1,3,5,5,1]code and code[1,2,2,3,2]code are compatible.  The nonstrict total orders are 0,4lt1lt2,3 and 0lt1,2,4lt3p  pIt would suffice for my purposes to restrict to the case where the biggest number is always codelenlist1code and the only possible values are integers from code1code to codelenlist1code emandem where codelist1code always is some permutation of that set of integers, but naturally I wouldnt complain if someone found something more general.   Thanks very much in advancep  pDisclaimer from a firsttime poster  This is emnotem a question about sorting   I did do quite a bit of searching for this, but really only found more programmingtype questions, which are nearly always about sorting or comparing values this is a little more subtle.  In fact, its really a mathematical application, so it may not seem as useful to many folks here, though it will be quite useful to me.  At any rate, its beyond my current skill level to hack this out very quickly, though I hope someday it will be obvious to me.  I dont think there is anything in itertools for this, either, though Id love to be proven wrong.p
Negative 5871 pIm creating a list of members on my site, and I want to enable them to look for eachother by first name and last name or either one. The catch is that a user can have several names, like names and then nicknames, also a person can have more than one lastnames, their maiden name and then the lastname after marriage. p  pOnce users fillout their names and last names, each user could have several names and last names, for example There could be a person with 3 names and 2 lastnames   names Eleonora, Ela, El and lastnames Smith, Brown.p  pThen if someone looks for Ela Brown, Eleonora Brown, Eleonora Smith or any other combination, they should find this person. p  pMy question, is how should I set this all up in sql mysql so tha schema and search is efficient and fast Didnt want to reinvent a wheel so I turned to pros and asking a question here.p  pThanks guysp  pP.S. I guess the standard solution would be to have a user table, fname table, lname table, userfname table with userid and fnameid and userlname table with userid and lnameid, but Im not sure if this is the best way to do this and wether or not search would be fast...p
Negative 5871 pI am currently trying to write a PHP script to connect to an Oracle database. The reason I am using PHP is because I need to connect the Oracle database with my current CRM system, written in PHPMySQL. p  pThe PHP is hosted on 1amp1 hosting, which is an external server. I read that I need to enable the extension phpoci8.dll to connect using ociconnect, but I cannot do so since I do not have root privileges. Did a search, and couldnt find the DLL either. p  pIs there any other way around this Any help greatly appreciated, please let me know if you need more information. Thanksp

Negative 5871 pIm trying to use DDD in my current project c, mvc, nhibernate, castle and Im thinking of best way to check a constraint that says any field or specific field must not change if entity is in some state, ie. invoice that is booked statebooked must not have amount field changed. In service layer I get some DTO object from gui or web service, etc that I need to map to domain object. After mapping is complete I want to validate my object  in particular I want to check the specific constraint in my question.p  pCurrently Im thinking ofp  ul litracking changes at entity level, i.e. on every setter add field to changed fields collection and switch NHibernate to use field access strategy. Variation of this pattern would  be to throw exception on setter if changing value is not allowedli licreating copy of object before mapping and the comparing original and mapped valuesli lifalling back on nhibernate and get this information from nhibernate session  however the rule will not be enforced at entity level imho it breaks dddli ul  pWhat do you think about it Do you know any good patterns for this Or am I missing something and I need to change my way of thinking about this constraintp  pThanks in advance for help.p

I have my server correctly setup in WHMCS and have checked the cURL error on the cURL website which says its a failure with receiving network data, which doesnt really help too much The same error occurs whether I connect via http or https.p  pI actually had this on my last VPS server too. The error was the same but would occassionally not display, though the data was also never returned. However I was just about to move servers at that point so didnt investigate the issue further. My hope was that the issue wouldnt follow me. Unfortnately it has The server in that instance was CentOS 5.7 x64p  pThe only question on StackOverflow that seems relevant mentions enabling OpenSSL extension. However this is only for Windows so isnt useful to me. Other problems around the net seem vauge and related to a vast arrange of different things. Usually Facebook app developers complaining of receiving the error back within their app. One person said the connection youre on can cause it but have confirm the error both via a home connection and a corporate network. Seemed unlikely anywayp  pI can confirm that PHP has been compiled with OpenSSL, I have withopensslusr withopenssldirusr in my PHP info information. It has also been compiled with cURL withcurloptcurlssl withcurlwrappers and cURL tests seem to return fine. cURL is showing the following infop  precodecURL Version 7.21.6 SSL Version OpenSSL1.0.0 ZLib Version 1.2.3 codepre  pHave checked the bitfields for the features and they come back as expectedp  precodeCURLVERSIONIPV6 matches CURLVERSIONKERBEROS4 does not match CURLVERSIONSSL matches CURLVERSIONLIBZ matches codepre  pAlso an array dump of the curlversion.

Whilst SSL wasnt setup for the domain when I logged the ticket as I didnt think it was a requirement to connect via SSL in order to use this tool, having used it in the past via http with no problems. In fact I think it uses port 2086 to communicate with the server, thought I could be wrong Either way I have now ruled this out as SSL is working fine for the domain and server now. As it is they believe it to be a configuration problem with my server rather than a problem with WHMCS so have passed the issue back, which is fair enough. I cant really argue and assume it would effect others, which I havent been able to find evidence of. However Im still at a bit of a loss. Unfortunately my VPS is unmanaged so cant ask anyone to login and take a look, though what theyd look for Im not sure.p  pFinally heres a list of things I have tried to see if I could get it to react any differently  Disabled the CSF firewall at all stages of testing  Accessing the install via server IP rather than domain name  Allowing WHMcPanel to connect on port 2086p  pI guess the only thing I havent done is rebuild Apache, but doubt that is going to resolve anything. Want to avoid doing that if possible. I suppose I can just ignore the problem for now and input the accounts manually, there arent loads. However Im loathed to gloss over it in case there is a config issue with my server that bites me harder further down the line. Equally if there is quirk or bug in the WHMCS software then I would like to be able to nail it down for them so that I can get up and running myself and avoid others from being effected. They seem pretty sure it isnt a bug in the codebase and without being able to see the code I cant say for sure myself. However I assume its a fairly mature part of their app so for now Im looking closer to homep  pAny ideas or experiences like this out there that might shed some light on what is going onp  pCheersp

Spawn child processes with os.fork      os.wait and act accordingly  def main     logserverpid  os.fork     if logserverpid  0          Create a LogRecordSocketServer daemon         ...         sys.exit0      Add SocketHandler to root logger     ...     monitorltconfiguration stuffgt  if name  main     main codepre  pstrongSo my questions arestrong Do I need to create a new codelogcode object after each codeos.forkcode  What happens to the existing global codelogcode objectp  pWith doing things the way I am, am I even getting around the problem that Im trying to avoid multiple open filessockets  Will this fail and why will it fail Id like to be able to tell if future similar implementations will failp  pAlso, in what way does the normal one codelogcode expression method of logging to one file from multiple processes fail Does it raise an IOErrorOSError  Or does it just not completely write data to the filep  pIf someone could provide an answer or links to help me out, that would be great.  Thanks.p  pstrongFYIstrong I am testing on Mac OS X Lion and the code will probably end up running on a CentOS 6 VM on a Windows machine if that matters.  Whatever solution I use does not need to work on Windows, but should work on a Unix based system.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong This question has started to move away from logging specific behavior and is more in the realm of what does linux do with file descriptors during forks.  I pulled out one of my college textbooks and it seems that if you open a file in append mode from two processes not before a fork that they will both be able to write to the file properly as long as your write doesnt exceed the actual kernel buffer although line buffering might need to be used, still not sure on that one.  This creates 2 file table entries and one vnode table entry.  Opening a file then forking isnt supposed to work, but it seems to as long as you dont exceed the kernel buffer as before Ive done it in a previous program.p  pSo I guess, if you want platform independent multiprocessing logging you use sockets and create a new SocketHandler after each fork to be safe as Vinay suggested below that should work everywhere.  For me, since I have strong control over what OS my software is being run on, I think Im going to go with one global codelogcode object with a FileHandler opens in append mode by default and line buffered on most OSs.  The documentation for a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryfunctions.htmlopen relnofollowcodeopencodea says A negative buffering means to use the system default, which is usually line buffered for tty devices and fully buffered for other files. If omitted, the system default is used. or I could just create my own logging stream to be sure of line buffering.  And just to be clear, Im ok withp  precode Process A afile.writeAn afile.writeAn  Process B afile.writeBn codepre  pproducing...p  precodeAn Bn An codepre  pas long as it doesnt produce...p  precodeABn n An codepre  pstrongVinaystrongor anyone else, how wrong am I  Let me know.

Negative 5871 pOne of my projects requires authentication for using RabbitMQ. Only authenticated users can connect to the rabbitmq server and subscribe to queues etc. For example, when a user connects to the server for the first time and sends some auth data like login, password  server should check it and, if the user passed authentication, he will be able to subscribe to queues etc. Otherwise, the server would disconnect the user.

Negative 5871 pI need to create stronga filesharing peertopeer networkstrong without a central server. p  pI read a lot of information on the topic. The requirement is to make sure every peer in the network keeps a full list of the other peers and a full list of all the files on the network. p  pI know its not the best way to do it, but its a requirement so ... Another in my opinion weird requirement is that the communication between the peers should be implemented with the HTTP protocol and JSONserialized.p  pThis means every peer will act as a webserver and will also have a way to connect to every other peer.p  pSo I want to know a good way to deliver a message from one peer to all others without having a single peer to connect directly to the others too many connections. p  pIve been looking for a way to somehow route the message a few levels so the traffic will be somewhat distributed. As I know and can connect to any peer on the network I can effectively construct a route before the message is sent and then tell some peers to reroute it. But how do I figure out the best route And what happens if theres a bugged peer which cant reroute the messagep  pstrongEDITstrong Im sorry if I didnt make it clear. The message should be received by ALL peers on the network, not just one target.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong You can think of what I want to do as a network of web servers. They should be able to hold data distributed not part of the question but every one of them needs to know what resources are available on the network a hashtable. A client can upload stuff on one of the servers doesnt matter which one. When that happens ALL others need to know of this change to update their hashtables. The same applies if a new server joins the network. My question is how to propagate this message without having a single server to connect to all the others, which clearly will generate a lot of traffic on a single server.p

Negative 5871 pIve read a lot of issues with trying to doublebuffer a richedit control, but have not seen any direct answers to this specific question would be really great to have a quotelink where Microsoft has an official statement.p  pHere is some code VCLDelphiBorland Builder 6.0 Ive been using for testingp  precodeifMessage.Msg  WMPAINT      HDC dc  GetDC0   HBITMAP memBitmap  CreateCompatibleBitmapdc,ClientRect.Right,ClientRect.Bottom   ReleaseDC0,dc   HBITMAP memDC  CreateCompatibleDC0   HBITMAP oldBitmap  SelectObjectmemDC,memBitmap   try   PAINTSTRUCT ps   dc  BeginPaintHandle,ampps   dc  GetDCHandle   Message.WParam  intmemDC   inheritedWndProcMessage   Message.WParam  0   BitBltdc,0,0,ClientRect.Right,ClientRect.Bottom,memDC,0,0,SRCCOPY   ReleaseDCHandle,dc   EndPaintHandle,ampps    finally            SelectObjectmemDC,oldBitmap      DeleteDCmemDC      DeleteObjectmemBitmap         return    codepre  pIf I call BeginPaint before inheritedWndProc that passes the message to the control for those that dont know VCL, then the control does not draw anything on my memory DC or the actual window DC.  If I call GetDC instead, the control still doesnt draw on the memory DC, but then it does draw on the window DC directly.  I confirm this by commenting out my BitBlt call.. if it isnt commented out, the client area is all black meaning the control didnt paint on the memory DC at all, if I comment out that line, the control draws correctly meaning it ignroed the WParam memory DC and went directly to the window DC.p  pWhile it sounds like Ive answered my own question, what I really want is confirmation from others link to MS KB article or MSDN would be great, so I can show my boss , strongAND possible other ideas to achieve doublebufferingstrong  I cant use most of the hacks I have found like having the control be hidden offscreen or using WMPRINT, because I need this control to actually work for userinput and scrollbars, its not just readonly for display.p  pAlso, the control is using RichEdit 2.0, even though Im using VCL.. it has been modified to create the window as richedit20a class.  I have also confirmed that the VCL layer is not messing with the painting at all, so this same behavior should be seen with pure win32 code.p

Negative 5871 pThis could potentially be a duplicate but I after spending several hours reading about ImageView, ImageSwitcher, Gallery Views, Lazy Loads, and more I decided I should just ask.  p  pI am working on an app and in one of the screens there may be an image or multiple images associate with what I am talking about.  The other data for this intent will be pulled from a local database.  In the database it will also have a list of URLs of images that are associate with each thing that I am discussing.  So I would like to know the best way to display a thumbnail of these pictures if there are any on the screen.  Then if these pictures are clicked on it can open up the bigger version of these pictures.  I dont necessarily want to download these pictures since I dont want to save them locally for the app.  Plus I dont want to make the page delay in loading while it waits to download the pictures.  p  pWhat is the best way to handle this scenario p

Negative 5871 pIm working on implementing a JSON RPC connection over TCPIP and I have one fundamental issue. Currently Im using a synchronous approach, which works well.p  pI can sendp  precodeid1,jsonrpc2.0,methodInput.Home codepre  pand receivep  precodeid1,jsonrpc2.0,resulttrue codepre  pThis works with no problems. The issue arises when I receive notifications. These can arrive unpredictably and at any time. I am interacting with the XBMC JSON RPC API. If a notification has been sent by XBMC, I receive multiple JSON requests at once. E.g.p  precodejsonrpc2.0,methodGUI.OnScreensaverActivated,paramsdatanull,senderxbmcjsonrpc2.0,methodGUI.OnScreensaverDeactivated,paramsdatanull,senderxbmc codepre  pThis causes a crash in JSON.NET, and understandably so. My first instinct is I need to asynchronously receive these notifications so that I dont have to wait until the next method is called to receive them. However this complicates the simple example I showed above because I can no longer utilize the synchronous calls. i.e.p  precodeSendJsonjson result  ReceiveJson codepre  pIs there a clean way to implement this without over complicating it AnyAll advice is appreciated.p

Negative 5871 pI have an youtube video playing in a specific frame. After researching a lot and not being able to properly destroy the player when exiting the frame, I decided to put a SoundMixer.stopAll in all frames that can be used to get out from the youtube one. That makes things right in most of cases, because to access the video again I must click a button that reloads the player and everything gets back to the start. But I have some thumbs on the right side of the page that when clicked open a large image, occupying most of the page and not showing the video button, but they have a close button themselves. When I click the close button that movieclip becomes invisible and the one with the youtube video becomes visible again whats great in all other cases. The point is the player kept playing in the background and when I close the image you can see it playing again, but without sound. The only way to make the sound audible again is clicking on the seek bar because it isnt a flash component itself, differently of the playpause button or going to another frame that not one from the thumbsimages and coming back. How could I make the sound play again automatically when entering the frame Help to destroy the player when exiting the frame is also welcome.p

Negative 5871 pOk, so I understand why salting a password prior to hashing is such a good idea. The question is, normally people suggest appending or prepending the salt to the password, why not do bothp  pMy thinking is, so if Mr hacker got hold of the DB and wants to get the password for person x, he thinks to himself, well most people suggest appending or prepending the salt, so lets do that.. He generates a rainbow table with of all the combinations of password  salt, and tries his luck. If that doesnt work he does the same but salt  password.p  pTo make much it more difficult to do the attack why dont developers go the step further and do salt  password  salt, or reversesalt  password  salt, or you could be fancy and start cutting up the passwordsalt, start putting bits of salt here and there etc.p  pThe only way the hacker would be able to find the password is if he has access to the source code to know how the salt was weaved into the password prior to hashingp  pA further note is, people suggest doing a minimum of 1000 iterations when keystretching, again why not 1147, 1652, etc p  pA 2nd further note, when looking at a hash string, is it possible to work out the hashing function usedp

Negative 5871 pIm having some trouble on a Java assignment for school.  We need to write a program that does T9 Word text prediction used by certain cell phones.  It should take a users input of numbers, find every possible combination of letters corresponding to those numbers, search a dictionary for each of those possible combinations, and display those which were found in the dictionary. Most of this program was already written for us by the professor, I just need to fill in the predictText method which does the combining of possibilities. It does the searching by calling another method that uses a recursive binary search, which I also had to fill in myself, although Im quite certain my search method is working well. Here is my predictText method, where parameter letter is the letter being currently processed, parameter input is the users input, and parameter wordMatches is the list of words that have been found in the dictionary.p  precode public static void predictTextString letter, String input, ArrayListltStringgt wordMatches             String[] two  new String[] a, b, c     String[] three  new String[] d, e, f     String[] four  new String[] g, h, i     String[] five  new String[] j, k, l     String[] six  new String[] m, n, o     String[] seven  new String[] p, q, r, s     String[] eight  new String[] t, u, v     String[] nine  new String[] w, x, y, z     char firstDigit     String finalWord        finalWord  letter      if input.equals            int lookup  searchfinalWord.trim       if lookup  1                wordMatches.addallWords[lookup]                  else                  firstDigit  input.charAt0       input  input.substring1        if firstDigit  2                for int i  0 i lt two.length i                    letter  two[i]           predictTextletter, input, wordMatches                        else if firstDigit  3                for int i  0 i lt three.length i                    letter  three[i]           predictTextletter, input, wordMatches                         And so forth, up to 9         codepre  pThe result that Im getting is that its only displaying single letters, it doesnt seem to be combining the letters into words and searching the dictionary for those complete words. Just in case some further explanation is needed, here are the assignment instructionsp  pYou will take the first digit from the input string, and call predictText again, once for each of the possible letters the first digit could represent, with the letter added to the variable word, and the first digit stripped from the input. For example, if the first time into predictText word is empty and input is 4663, you would call predictText recursively 3 times with  word as g and input as 663,  word as h and input as 663,  word as i and input as 663 The process would repeat, and youd keep building up the word so for word as g and the next digit being 6, you would recursively call with gm, gn, and go with the input 63 Once there is no more input to process recursively, youve reached a base case so then call the search method to see if the word you generated exists in the dictionary. If it does, add it to the wordMatches list.p  pEDIT I also thought I should include my search method code, just in case it actually is causing my problem.p  precodepublic static int searchString key         return searchallWords, key, 0, allWords.length1        public static int searchString[] dictionary, String key, int start, int end         int middle  start  end  start  2     int index  1      if start gt end            index  1          else if key.compareToIgnoreCasedictionary[middle]  0            index  middle          else if key.compareToIgnoreCasedictionary[middle] lt 0            index  searchdictionary, key, start, middle  1          else            index  searchdictionary, key, middle  1, end           return index    codepre

When user is inactive for e.g. 30 minutes, marksDB is deleted.

Negative 5871 pMy code is basically a program to check whether it is possible to use the ordered sequence 1,2,3..,n to generate a permutation of this sequence as specified by the user using a stack as temporary storage structure. The user has the option of entering n and the permutation hed like to see generated using 2 methods either through a text file or directly in the command line. So, for example if the user enters 5 1 3 5 4 2, the n would be interpreted as the first number, i.e. 5 and then the rest of the digits is the permutation hed like to see if it s possible to generate starting from 1 2 3 4 5 Note that 1 2 3 4 5 is ordered and 1 is at the top of that stack. Here youd have 1 being used directly, then 2 being stored in a stack, then 3 being used, then 4 stored on top of 2, then 5 being used, then 4 popped out followed by 2 being popped to generate the permutation. The problem Im having is my program faces a NullPointerException whenever I try to generate the starting stack of 1 2 3 ... n.

Negative 5871 pI am preparing a SQL statement from values passed through a query string.  I am using the Play framework.

Its OK when there are 2 dynamic values but when you get up to 5 or 6 this would just get ridiculous. p  pIs there an easier way of doing this to make it more flexible so that I would know how to fill in all the codecode in a better fashionp

I have previously seen this occur when multithreaded classes are under test against mock objects, but this time its all happening in a single thread. Its like JMock is somehow returning a different mock object from the first method call, even though I mocked no such object. p  pIf I remove the overridden method which is returning a more specific type then it goes away, but I obviously cant do that. Likewise, if I remove the use of ClassImposteriser, the problem goes away, but one of the objects Im mocking in the real test is someone elses class. I guess I could try using two Mockery instances in the one test, but aside from that Im out of ideas.p

I also need to be able to use this utility to find strings in very large log files, MB size.  p  precodeclass Program      public static int linecounter     public static int filecounter     static void Mainstring[] args                       INIT                  filecounter  0         linecounter  0         string word          Read properties from application settings.         string filelocation  Properties.Settings.Default.FavOne          Set Args from console.         word  args[0]                  Recursive search for sub folders and files                  string startDIR         string filename         startDIR  Environment.CurrentDirectory         startDIR  cSearchStringTestDIR         filename  args[1]         DirSearchstartDIR, word, filename          Console.WriteLinefilecounter     Files found         Console.WriteLinelinecounter     Lines found         Console.ReadKey           static void DirSearchstring dir, string word, string filename              string fileline         string ColorOne  Properties.Settings.Default.ColorOne         string ColorTwo  Properties.Settings.Default.ColorTwo         ConsoleColor valuecolorone  ConsoleColorEnum.ParsetypeofConsoleColor, ColorOne         ConsoleColor valuecolortwo  ConsoleColorEnum.ParsetypeofConsoleColor, ColorTwo          try                      foreach string f in Directory.GetFilesdir, filename                              StreamReader file  new StreamReaderf                 bool t  true                 int counter  1                 while fileline  file.ReadLine  null                                      if fileline.Containsword                                              if t                                                  t  false                         filecounter                         Console.ForegroundColor  valuecolorone                         Console.WriteLine                          Console.WriteLinef                         Console.ForegroundColor  valuecolortwo                                                  linecounter                         Console.WriteLinecounter.ToString  .   fileline                                          counter                                  file.Close                 file  null                          foreach string d in Directory.GetDirectoriesdir                              Console.WriteLined                 DirSearchd,word,filename                                catch System.Exception ex                      Console.WriteLineex.Message                 codepre

They advised me to make sure that I am targeting x86 which I am.  They also stated that I should be able to build my projects against any version of the .NET runtime.  Personally, I suspect that it has something to do with the fact that I am referencing a version 1 type library in Visual Studio 2010  .NET Runtime 4.0 whereas before I was building on VS 2008  .NET Runtime 3.5.  I have tried building against all build configurations i.e. x86, x64, Any Cpu and tried every version of the runtime back to 2.0.  The warnings concern me because I am not sure what they indicate.

Negative 5871 pIm new to mobile programming. Recently my company has looked into creating a specific application for tablets Android and iOS. So it was assigned to me to develop a thinclient based around using HTML5 for what we need to do.p  pEssentially the application allows a user to fill in a customdesigned form which the user can build themselves, or pull down a predefined template from our server. This form is built using HTML5, Javascript, JQuery, etc. Some additional functionality is planned, such as being able to take a picture using the native device and attach it to the form that we send back to our server for storage once we figure out how to do it in iOS. Weve already done it in Android.p  pHowever, I noticed the following on Apples App Store Guidelines, under the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comappstoreresourcesapprovalguidelines.htmlfunctionality relnofollowFunctionalitya section. Item 2.12p  pemApps that are not very useful, unique, strongare simply web sites bundled as Appsstrong, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejectedemp  pCan someone explain, or at least direct me to clarification of this when using the UIWebView construct This application at its core is pretty much just HTML5. While it might have some additional bells and whistles, does this mean that if we try to submit this when its completed to Apple, that they will simply reject it out of hand Implementing the majority of it in HTML5 was done purposely so we wouldnt have to recode everything from device to device and we will also embed it in one of our products, so if they want to fill it out on the desktop while in our system, they can. p  pAny guidance would be appreciated, or even suggestions of where this question should be asked if SO is not the proper forum for it. Thanks again.p

Negative 5871 pI am in Windows 7, .NET 4.5, IE10.  I have a simple windows form application with a codeWebBrowsercode control. Every time the page navigates, I want to add a click handler. I notice that memory is leaking when I do this. I am in fact detaching the event handlers and so am confused as to why memory is leaking.p  pI noticed that I can attach to the codeHtmlDocument.Clickcode event and do not see the leaks associated with codeHtmlElement.Clickcode. This is demonstrated in the program below that periodically navigates using a timer.p  pAlso of interest is that the URL does seem to matter... e.g. I see the problem with a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma but not with a hrefhttpthin.npr.org relnofollowhttpthin.npr.orga or aboutblank. This would lead me to believe that at the core this is a javascript problem, but then the fix I am currently employing see below doesnt really have anything to do with javascript...p  pSo what is causing the problem and how do I work around the issues so my program does not leak memoryhandlesp  pMy current fix is to call codeMarshal.ReleaseComObjectcode on the codeHtmlElement.DomElementcode property.  Is this a correct thing to do Shouldnt codeHtmlElementcode clean up after itself, like codeHtmlDocumentcode apparently does Should I expect problems with other classes in addition to codeHtmlElementcodep  pIm tempted to sprinkle codeMarshal.ReleaseComObjectcode generously anywhere that I see a com object and not assume the containing class will properly do so.

Negative 5871 pIs there a better way to do the following in Xcode for iPhone appp  pI have a main navigation UIViewController screen with 4 buttons on it.p  pClicking button 1 shows a sub navigation UIViewController with 4 buttons on it. Clicking button 2 shows the same sub navigation UIViewController but with 5 buttons on it. Clicking button 3 shows the same sub navigation UIViewController but with 4 buttons on it. Clicking button 4 shows the same sub navigation UIViewController but with 6 buttons on it.p  pTo handle this I have assigned tags to each button in the main navigation. When a button is clicked, I take this tag number and pass it to sub navigation UIViewController.p  pThen in the sub navigation UIViewController, based on this value, I manually drawcreate the sub navigation buttons as needed.p  pBelow is how I handle this in the sub navigation UIViewController. I check to see what value was passed from main navigation UIViewController, and draw the number of buttons accordingly. I also set custom background images for each button. And for each button click I have its own selector method. Note that some buttons in the sub navigation will go to a UIViewController while some buttons will go to a TableViewController. Also each sub navigation button will have to display its own content in its destination view.p  pIs there a better, more elegant way of handling this It just seems like a lot of code duplication to me.The example below shortened for brevity.p  precode  SubNavViewController.m   SegueTest import SubNavViewController.h import GettingHereViewController.h import TableViewController.h import GettingHereContent.h  interface SubNavViewController  end  implementation SubNavViewController synthesize tagNumber synthesize buttonNumber synthesize buttonPushedTrackNumber  synthesize hotelButton synthesize bAndBButton synthesize caravanButton synthesize selfCateringButton synthesize apartmentsButton . . . etc 19 in total    idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil      self  [super initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenibBundleOrNil]     if self            return self    voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      if self.tagNumber  1              self.navigationItem.title  Getting Here           By Air Button         byAirButton  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeCustom]         byAirButton.tag  1         byAirButton.frame  CGRectMake25, 140, 280.f, 40.f         UIImage airButton  [UIImage imageNamedgettingHereByAirButton.png]         [byAirButton setBackgroundImageairButton forStateUIControlStateNormal]         [self.view addSubviewbyAirButton]         [byAirButton addTargetself actionselectorbyAirButtonClicked forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]           By Rail Button         byRailButton  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeCustom]         byRailButton.tag  2         byRailButton.frame  CGRectMake25, 190, 280.f, 40.f         UIImage railButton  [UIImage imageNamedgettingHereByRailButton.png]         [byRailButton setBackgroundImagerailButton forStateUIControlStateNormal]         [self.view addSubviewbyRailButton]         [byRailButton addTargetself actionselectorbyRailButtonClicked forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]          .         .         . etc 2 more button          else if self.tagNumber  2              self.navigationItem.title  Where to Stay           BampB Button         bAndBButton  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeCustom]         bAndBButton.tag  1         bAndBButton.frame  CGRectMake25, 140, 280.f, 40.f         UIImage bedAndBreakfast  [UIImage imageNamedwhereToStayBedAndBreakfastButton.png]         [bAndBButton setBackgroundImagebedAndBreakfast forStateUIControlStateNormal]         [self.view addSubviewbAndBButton]         [bAndBButton addTargetself actionselectorbAndBButtonClicked forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]         .         .         . etc do this for the rest of the buttons      voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]    void byAirButtonClicked      GettingHereContent gettingHere  [GettingHereContent new]     gettingHere  By Air     NSLogContent , gettingHere     [self performSegueWithIdentifiergettingHereSegue senderself]    void bAndBButtonClicked      GettingHereContent gettingHere  [GettingHereContent new]     gettingHere  Bed and Breakfast     NSLogContent , gettingHere     [self performSegueWithIdentifiertableViewSegue senderself]   . . . do this for all buttons  19 in total   void prepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender   end codepre

Negative 5871 pIm getting puzzling file output when using flush with ofstream on Windows7 with VC 2010 professional. p  pEssentially, I want to serialise some values, and check them while debugging. Why does the file contain incorrectly serialised values until the INTMAX max is written Notice how the unsigned int values appear to be truncated only first two bytes, then the missing bytes reappear emafterem the INTMAX value gets written.

Negative 5871 pI got an application which uses WIF and ADFS for authentication. This application is in JavascriptjQuery, and uses .ajax calls to connect to an MVC Web Api.p  pHere is my issue, if the application goes idle for too long 30ish minutes, any subsequent call to the MVC Web API returns a 302 found code, which probably redirects to my ADFS authentication page. p  pHowever I do not know how to deal with the 302 Found message in an Ajax call.

Negative 5871 pI have a basic question regarding MPI, to get a better understanding of it I am new to MPI and multiple processes so please bear with me on this one. I am using a simulation environment in C RepastHPC that makes extensive use of MPI using the Boost libraries to allow parallel operations. In particular, the simulation consists of multiple instances of the respective classes i.e. agents, that are supposed to interact with each other, exchange information etc. Now given that this takes place on multiple processes and given my rudimentary understanding of MPI the natural question or fear I have is, that agents on different processes dont intereact with each other anymore because they cannot connect I know, this contradicts the entire idea of MPI.p  pAfter reading the manual my understanding is this the available libraries of Boost.MPI and also the libaries of the above mentionend package take care of all of the  communication and sending packages back and forth between processes, i.e. each process has copies of the instances from other processes I guess this is some form of call by value, bc the original instance cannot be changed from a process that has only a copy, then an updating takes place, to ensure that the copies of the instances have the same information as the originals and so on. p  pDoes this mean, that in terms of the final outcomes of the simulations runs, I get the same as if I would be doing the entire thing on one process Put differently, the multiple processes are just supposed to speed up things but not change the design of simulation thus I dont have to worry about itp

Negative 5871 pOK, so I recently learned that a stdvector uses contiguous memory by definitionstandard, and thus b ampv[0] is the address of that contiguous block of memory, which you can readwrite to as an oldskool Carray. Like...p  precodevoid printemsizet n, int iary  for sizet i0 iltn i stdcout ltlt iary[i] ltlt stdendl  void doublemsizet n, int iary  for sizet i0 iltn i iary[i]  2   stdvectorltintgt v for sizet i0 ilt100 i v.pushbacki int iptr  ampv[0] doublemv.size, iptr printemv.size, iptr codepre  pOK, so thats cool, but I want to go in the other direction. I have lots and lots of existing code like p  precodedouble computeSomethingconst stdvectorltSomeClassgtamp v  ...  codepre  pIf I have a Carray of objects, I can use such code like thisp  precodeSomeClass cary[100]  100sizeofSomeClass  populate this however stdvectorltSomeClassgt v for sizet i0 ilt100 i v.pushbackcary[i]  now v is also using 100sizeofSomeClass double x  computeSomethingv codepre  pI would like to do that a without the extra space and b without the extra time of inserting a redundant copy of all that data into the vector. Note that just change your stupid computeSomething, idiot is not sufficient, because there are thousands of such functionsmethods that exhibit this pattern that are not under my control and, even if they were are too many to go and change all of them. p  pNote also that because I am only interested in const stdvectoramp usage, there is no worry that my original memory will ever need to be resized, or even modified. I would want something like a const stdvector constructor, but I dont know if the language even allows special constructors for const instances of a class, likep  precodenamespace std  template lttypename Tgt class vector    vector  ...    vectorsizet n  ...    vectorsizet n, const Tamp t  ...    const vectorsizet n, T  ...   can this be done ... codepre  pIf that is not possible, how about a container derived off of stdvector called stdconstvector, which a could construct from a pointer to a carray and a size, and b purposefully did not implement nonconst methods pushback, resize, etc., so then even if the object with a typename of constvector is not actually a const object, the interface which only offers const methods makes it practically const and any erroneous attempts to modify would be caught at compile timep  pUPDATE A little messing around shows that this solves my problem wrt Windowsimplementation of stdvectorp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class vectortweaker  public stdvectorltTgt  public   vectortweakersizet n, T t      saveMyfirst  Myfirst     saveMylast   Mylast     saveMyend    Myend     Myfirst  t     Mylast   t  n     Myend    t  n      vectortweaker      Myfirst  saveMyfirst     Mylast   saveMylast     Myend    saveMyend  and proceed to stdvector destructor    private   T saveMyfirst   T saveMylast   T saveMyend  codepre  pBut of course that solution is hideous because a it offers no protection against the base class deleting the original memory by doing a resize or pushback except for a careful user that only constructs const vectortweaker  and b it is specific to a particular implementation of stdvector, and would have to be reimplemented for others  if indeed other platforms only declare their stdvector member data as protected as microsoft did seems a Bad Idea.p

Negative 5871 pI have a problem I really cannot get rid of. I am using Glassfish 4.0 embedded in Eclipse together with JAXB 2.2 and Jersey 2.0. I want to create a REST interface, where the function called by Jersey is expecting two paramters. For example two path parameters or or a mixture of JAXB and one PathParameter. Either way I always get a ModelValidationException with Jersey. Injecting only one parameter into the function works great, but I need at least two and sometimes even more.p  pI found this thread about this topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14288856jersey2injectionsourceJersey 2 injection sourcea but I think this is not the solution for me, since I am working with a GET, POST or even PUT and dont want to use form data. In the end I always get the same error no matter if I use PUT, POST or GET. I can of course workaround this problem with using the p  precodeContext UriInfo info codepre  pinformation and extract the path parameters by using for examplep  precodelong portID  new

Negative 5871 pIm using IntelliJ GUI Builder to design a GUI for my application.  In it, there is a codeJTablecode inside a codeJScrollPanecode that doesnt seem to be working.  Firstly, I cant get the column headers to display.  Second, table clicking is not working.  It acts as if Im clicking 3 rows down from where I actually am, both in default row selection and in any codeMouseListenerscode I implement.  Lastly, if the table exceeds the size of the codeJScrollPanecode, it just ignores the last X rows and doesnt provide a scroll bar to view them.  p  pIve reworked the project a couple times now, trying extensions of codeAbstractTableModelcode, then codeDefaultTableModelcode, and lately I have tried ditching a custom codeTableModelcode altogether and just using a codeDefaultTableModelcode constructor to no avail.

Negative 5871 pJust installed Pig 0.13 and I am attempting to use it with Hadoop 1.1.2. Pig documentation states Pig 0.13 is compatible with Hadoop 1.1.2.

Negative 5871 pI have a lot of data that needs fuzzily queried very quickly which, of course, is relative, but within the magnitude of a few seconds for 100 million keys, but ideally faster. Its in the form of keyvalue pairs, where keys are a unique string and values are an array of strings. This is the structure of the actual data, but Im free to organize it into whatever data structures make lookup faster.p  pstrongA lookup of values for a key should include not only the values for that exact key, but also the values for all keys within a levenshtein distance within a predetermined threshold say, 5.strongp  pFor example, a lookup of codehellocode should not only return all values indexed under the key for codehellocode, but also those for codeHellocode, codehellocode, codeyellocode, codehelocode, codehellooocode, etc.p  pThe naive solution, of course, is iterating over each key, calculating its levenshtein distance, and including its values if it is within a certain threshold. However, this solution does not scale well with On time complexity to iterate over each key, On1 to iterate over each key to compare it to, and On per levenshtein calculation, resulting in a lookup time of On  n  n1 which, of course, is unacceptable.p  pHow can I structure this data to optimize lookup time complexity Space complexity, insert, delete, and edit runtimes are all irrelevant though, Id prefer to keep inserts under a second each to avoid bottlenecks there also.p  pSome information on the datap  ul liUnique keys are ready to be added at a fairly constant rate of 10secondli liStrings are ready to append to value arrays at a fairly constant rate of 10secondli liThe size of each keys value is typically 15 elements, but some outliers have hundredsli liEach string in the value arrays are typically 2040 characters in lengthli ul

Negative 5871 pI am building a website that hosts an online game. In this game there are lots of characters and monsters. Each of these has their own base set of numbers to determine the details of each particular character. I have one master character sheetmanagement pages to changemodify these characters. p  pGoal p  ul liI need to load character information once, no matter what page the user goes to or if they refresh the page. If the character doesnt change I do not want the server to recalculate everything. If the character changes stats or they change to a new character I need to recalculate the character.li ul  pCurrent Solutionp  ul liI pass the character ID, charID as a URL parameter. A function checks if it a new character or the same. It checks to see when the character was last updated. It also checks to see if there is a cookie createddate and what the date is. If it does not see the cookie, or the character has been updated it builds new cookies for the character information. This function dynamically builds 4060 cookies with all kinds of information.li ul  pProblem p  ul liWhen the function sees it should rebuild the cookies it does so, but it also logs out the user. I think this is because I am not unsetting the cookies properly.

There were more than one actual problem in this topic. The main one was that the regex was not matching the proper string. The ID string and the type of transaction string were on the same line, that is true, but on those lines the ID was like aaaaaabbbbbcccc  , with two spaces at the end. That makes AWK to parse  aaaaaaaabbbbcccc and  as two different fields. I realized when I didp  precode4  regex print 4 codepre  pand a lot of valid IDs appeared.p  pThe second problem, which appeared after fixing the regular expression have been addressed by some people here. Having the main regular expression and the firs  in separated lines makes awk to print each record. I realized that myself and the same day later I read here the solutions. Amazing.p  pThank you very much to every one. I can only accept one answer as valid, but I learned a lot from all of them.p

Negative 5871 pSo I am facing this little problem. In my route config I have configured two routes. One default route, which handles codecontrolleractioncode request and one custom route which is basically codewebsite.commyroutecode where codemyroutecode is received by some controllers action as an argument. the problem is that whenever I want to give that action a parameter which contains a  in it, the route handler resolves request to controlleraction route config, so if looks like this codewebsite.commyroutemysubroutecode, you get what happens. the codemyrouteControllercode is searched and of course it does not exist, now the number of  in url can be more than one as you see and I want to do such thing. if the appropriate controller with appropriate action does not exist I want this request to be handled but that one controller whichs action will recieve codemyroutemysubroutecode as an argument. What is the best practice in this situation. If need I can provide the route config.p

Negative 5871 pSuppose we have a complex class that interfaces with several different other objects, and these interactions depend on the states of one another.p  pImmediately I would attempt to use several state booleans to try and keep track of these states, but this often leads to messy code filled with IF statements.p  pAre there settled solutions or design patterns to handle this while minimizing the messinessp  pAs an example, consider something like thisp  precodeint Fooint A, int B, inc C      ifstate1 ampamp state2         return AB      else ifstate1 ampamp state2 ampamp state3         return AC      else ifstate1 ampamp state4  state5         return C         ...      codepre  pIts easy to see how something like this would run out of control very quicklyp

Negative 5871 pI am working on a C WPF application that uses two screens. In the application the user is able to clone or extend the screen depending on what the user want to do.

When using the above code I manage to cloneextend the screen. However, after this is done the taskbar at the bottom of the screen is in front of the full screen application which should not be the case. How do i put the application window back at the topp  pAdditional information When I start the application it starts in fullscreen with the taskbar behind the application. This is done by setting the followingp  precodeWindowStateMaximized WindowStyleNone codepre  pAnd this is what I want after the cloneextend has been done. Thanksp  pstrongEditstrong I have noticed that after I cloneextend the screen and sleep for say 5 seconds everything works as it should. However, as soon as the 5 seconds is over and the function exits the taskbar gets on top. Therefore it seems that I can not change something right after the cloneextend because the taskbar will always get on top in the end. So somehow I have to figure out how to stop the taskbar to behave like this, instead of changing the property of the window.p

Negative 5871 pI am currently running into problems with java generics, linked listques structures and methods that should operate on them. Currently, I am trying to write generic methods that should manipulate a linked list of jobs for my school project. I have to implement basic methods, such as enque, deque, sortbypriority, get number of elements and so on. The element is, say, a printing job with a priority. A print que shall be implemented as a linked list of jobs. I am not allowed to use any predefined collection classes. p  pThis being said, I am not getting something obvious. In the java code shown below, there are 3 classes Job, MyPrintQue and LinkNode and one generic interface PrintQue. I am not importing any other classes from java.util.

Negative 5871 pI know how to create a single interface that can be applied to different objects. Thats not what Im looking for. I want the opposite behavior I want to find a mechanism to provide different interfaces to the same object, without paying for virtual calls.p  pEssentially, lets say I have a queue, with the methods PushMessage, PopMessage and IsEmptyp  precodeclass Queue    public     void PushMessageMessage message     Message PopMessage     bool IsEmpty const  codepre  pI want to hand someone a handle to this queue, but only let them call PopMessage and IsEmpty, and hand someone else a handle to the same queue that only lets them call PushMessage. So the owner of the queue decides who can write to it and who can remove messages from it.p  pOne idea I had was to create two classes that hold no data members of their own, but inherit from Queue and provide proxy methodsp  precodestruct EnQueueer    private Queue    void PushMessageMessage messageQueuePushMessagemessage   struct DeQueueer    private Queue    Message PopMessage return QueuePopMessage   bool IsEmpty const return QueueIsEmpty  codepre  pBut Im not sure this is safe. The owner of the original Queue would have to upcast to EnQueueer or DeQueueer, which Im not sure is entirely correct. Moreover, the compiler didnt like itp  precodestaticcastltDeQueueergtampmqueue  Results in compile error                                     Queue is an inaccessible base of DeQueueer codepre  preinterpretcast solves the problem, but Im not sure if its safe.

I found some examples to store only a string e.g. a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationDataManagementConceptualDocBasedAppProgrammingGuideForOSXManagingLifecycleManagingLifecycle.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationDataManagementConceptualDocBasedAppProgrammingGuideForOSXManagingLifecycleManagingLifecycle.htmla or this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com12779icloudanduidocumentbeyondthebasicspart1 relnofollowhttpwww.raywenderlich.com12779icloudanduidocumentbeyondthebasicspart1ap  pTheres also NSPersistentDocument to work with core data, which I think is what I would have to try out.p  pBut generally speaking, does it have any benefit to use NSDocument for my todo list One could be the undo functionality but Im not sure if this is applicable. Any advicesp  pIm also not sure if I have to use one document for each todo or rather load them all in one document, and if this works correctly with table view... Maybe in a todo app I will never get hundreds of entries, but principally I could. Would I be able to paginate, etc. Thanksp  pEdit I just read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4133048documentbasedapplicationornotrq1Documentbased application, or nota specially The key question is one of independence. If all of the objects in your applications model are related then theres no need to manage independent documents. Not sure how to apply this to my model... Its relational. Some 11 and 1n relationships. Does this mean that all my objects are related Or can I still treat them as independent documents...p

Negative 5871 pI am just working on a project where I want to visualize some devices, which have some input and outputpins. Currently I got all data and attributes of a device from a MariaDB MySQL with the help of a PHPscript output via the vardumpcommand.br Every device is an object of my deviceclass, which has some subclasses. Now I want to visualize every device with its pins, temperature and additional data on a website and I dont know whats the best way to go on from here.p  pThe website should be dynamically, so that a click on a pin opens a popup with some information. The websitecontent should refresh every 15 seconds and should have a modern design.

Negative 5871 pTheres 2 parts to this question. Im trying to simply add a column to a fairly large table. The current table has about 200 million rows and about 10 columns, is about 80 GB in size, has 2 keys primary and one other, and is constantly being written into its live.p  pIm attempting to add a column as followsp  pcodeALTER TABLE mylargebusytable ADD newcolumn BIGINT20codep  ol lipThe first issue Im having is with the amount of time its taking. On my last attempt, I got timed out after 100 minutes. I wanted to make sure this is reasonable because it seems like a long time. One option Im considering is turning off all incoming queries to the table to prevent any sort of blocking issues and rerunning without any timeout limits.pli lipThe next issue is after I got timed out on my previous query, I checked AWS CloudWatch and noticed that my db instance ate through another 160 GB of free space. Most of this would have been from the codeALTER TABLEcode command. From my understanding, when adding a table, MySQL copies the data over to a new table. If thats the case shouldnt it take 80 GB the size of the table In addition, after timing out the space is not being released, so now I have 160 GB of data that I cant seem to access, find or remove.pli ol  pIm trying to release that 160 GB of space as well as actually add my column to the table.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo apparently if MySQL crashes during an alter, InnoDB can cause an orphaned table which was causing the space issue I had. See a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0eninnodbtroubleshootingdatadict.html relnofollowhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0eninnodbtroubleshootingdatadict.htmlap  pI eventually fixed it by using codeSHOW PROCESSLISTcode in MySQL and then codeKILLcodeing the process.p  pInstead of altering the table, Ive created a new table with the new columns and Im copying data over in smaller chunks which seems to work much better.p

Negative 5871 pIt seems this question has been asked numerous times  however not for python and also interpreting research papers is not my cup of teap  pIf you look at the openCV python2 lkhomography sample, you see that opencv can quite easily track the 2D perspecitve shift from one image to the next. If you open that sample and move your camera around, opencv can map exactly where the original image is in relation to the new one.p  pMy question is really about whether its possible to take this 2D perspective transform and turn it into a 3D one  e.g, if the points spread out in 2D, its obviously coming closer to the camera in 3D  and if the points skew to the left or right, thats a 3D rotation.p  pIs there a function to do this Something like cv2.getAffineTransform but in a 3rd dimension.p  pThe end goal here is to use a camera to estimate change in position of a robot.p

But initially when the tiles are created they are eventually goes outside until I clicks and drag them inside of parent.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8 gt     lttitlegtDashboardlttitlegt      ltlink hrefcssjqueryuijqueryui.min.css relstylesheet gt      ltstyle typetextcssgt         .statsTile                      minwidth 180px             width 180px             minheight 180px             height 180px             padding 0.5em             background white             position fixed important                       .statsTile h4                              textalign center                 margin 0                       container                      width 800px             height 500px             background 666666             float left               ltstylegt      ltscript srcscriptsjqueryjquery2.1.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcscriptsjqueryuijqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          function               wrapper container .uiwidgetcontent.statsTile.draggable                 cursor move,                 containment parent                           wrapper container .uiwidgetcontent.statsTile.resizable                 containment parent                            ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idwrappergt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtCall Abbondanedlth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtAbbondaned lth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtAverage Ring Timelth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtCall Answeredlth4gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 5871 pEdit I apologise if this was quite badly written the first time around.p  pThe issue I seem to be having is that the main method does not codegetcode me the object inside the ArrayList, rather it seems to be fetching a string.

Negative 5871 pHaving an outer list of inner elements, each said inner element being  a flatnested list. Each said inner list has a nesting structure that matches the inner list in the preceding outer cell. Meaning that each primitive value in a list either corresponds to a primitive value or to a list  in the following cell list recursively applied. Thus, each inner list has a depth that is equal to or exceeds by 1 the depth of the element in the preceding cell.p  pNotice that the first cell element can start as a nested list of any depth.p  pExample of the abovep  precode[     [[1, 2,      [3, 4]], 1           ],     [[3, [4, 5], [6, 7]], [5, 4]      ],        [[5, [6, 7], [8, 9]], [7, [8, 6]] ], ] codepre  pIt is desired to unfold the nested lists into a list of tuples, where each value is combined either with the parent value, or the corresponding list element if parent is list with order being maintained.

This means, in most cases I dont really care about the inner codeFunccode, just string that the codeExpression.Bodycodes rightmost leaf evaluates to, but in one case at least, I do care about compiling and evaluating the codeFunccode.p  pNB2 This code is expected to run through a bunch of expressions every time objects using it are created, but its NOT expected to be run after object creation  so Im ok with reflection in principle.p  pEDIT Updated code substantially to give a clearer idea of what this is used for.p
Negative 5871 pI am consuming the Rest web services of HP Quality Center using java jersey client. The problem is if i store the cookies LWSSO,QCsession,XSRF,Jsessionid somewhere and then when i log out it will null the cookies value and send me in the response which is the expected behavior . But if send the stale cookies that i have stored earlier i am able to read the data from the server which is wrong .Ideally it should send me 401 Http status but it is not. Any help will be appreciated. Also can i see the logs of the Rest calls i made to HP quality Center Serverp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 5871 pHas anyone read through both logback and log4j source code, I read a hrefhttplogback.qos.chreasonsToSwitch.html relnofollowhttplogback.qos.chreasonsToSwitch.htmla, it says logback internals have been rewritten to perform about ten times faster on certain critical execution paths. Not only are logback components faster, they have a smaller memory footprint as well. Does anyone know how that happens from source code levelp

Negative 5871 pBefore putting this on the cloud code I tested it in Angular with success producing the correct console.log responses throughout the program.  Since this function manipulates data in the user table it must use the master key and be in cloud code.  With this code in the cloud it saves the column duty to the user table but with no data there is data to be saved, this I am sure of.

Negative 5871 pI have to use a simulator which its author has published it as java web start application. The simulator uses java3d for visualization, however, the application can be executed without java3d with limited features of course. We have java3d installed in our machines but the location of jar files and codelibj3dcoreogl.socode is different from the default locations. And the problem is, I am not able to make the application work with java3d. p  pI set codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode but there was no success. My question has two folds. Firstly, how can I tell codejavawscode where to look for code.socode file or java3d jar files if it matters Is there anything to do by modifying the codejnplcode file or, passing some argument through codeJcode option in command linep  pSecondly, I am no expert in java web start. With said, is it not the case that all dependencies are downloaded from the publishers servers and are cached on client machine If so, why should be any problem with java3d in the first placep  pPlease note that I am on the client side and I do not have possibility to modify the source code. Furthermore, we do not have root access in our machines and everything is done in our home directory.p

Negative 5871 pWe distribute an enterprise server solution to clients. We released an iOS amp Android app 18 months ago which is designed to communicate with the server. Our clients are on different versions of the server and were finding that our app cannot be backwards compatible with all of them. New server versions are released every 4 times per year.p  pWe cannot tell our clients to upgrade to the same version of the server  its costly and very timeconsuming. p  pThe preferred solution is to upload a different app per version of the server. For example, the app which is compatible with server version 5.4.8 would be called MyApp 548. The app which is compatible with 5.5.1 of the server would be called MyApp 551.p  pIs this doable Are there any examples of this already out therep  pThanks, Andyp

Negative 5871 pEach time I write a function which has one ore more parameters, the first thing I do in the function body is to check that the received value of each parameter is valid. p  pFor examplep  precode    def turnonoroffpowersupplies engine, powersupply, switchonoroff  RemoteRebootConst.OFF                       summary                                                      The function turns off or turns on the switch.              param engine                 SSH connection to the switch              param switchonoroff                 This sets whether to turn off, or turn on the switch.

This error messages makes debugging this kind of problems much more easier.p  pAs said earlier, If there have been more parameters,I will do the above code for EACH parameter. p  pThis makes my function body to me much bigger in terms of number of lines of code. p  pIs there a more pythonic way to print all of the above details in case there is an exception due to invalid parameter value received function name, parameter name, expected values, actual valuesp  pI can write a function which receives 4 parameters function name, parameter name, expected values, actual value, and then use it each time I would like to raise this kind of exception this will cause each exception of this sort to be just one line of code instead of several onesp  pI will appreciate any help here. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 5871 pIm sorry that I cant post code to reproduce this.  My problem is precisely that I dont know how to go about debugging this issue.p  pI am using ptrace with codePTRACEOTRACEFORK  PTRACEOTRACEEXEC  PTRACEOTRACEVFORK  PTRACEOTRACEVFORKDONE  PTRACEOTRACECLONEcode to trace a process and its children and the childrens children.  The mechanism is much like codestracecode, but with slightly different purposes, as Im just tracking files that are read or modified.p  pMy code written in C works fine on Debian wheezy and Debian jessie on the x8664 architecture and also lesstested on i386.  When I try to compile and run on an Ubuntu Precise x8664 virtual machine which uses a 3.2.0 kernel, I run into trouble.p  pOn the Precise machine, I emsometimesem find that I do not receive a codePTRACEEVENTVFORKcode immediately after a codevforkcode call happens, but instead start receiving events a couple of codeSIGSTOPcode events, and a few system calls without ever getting the codePTRACEEVENTVFORKcode event.  I dont see anything suspicious in the system calls being performed, and the behavior is not predictable.p  pIm not sure what to try to reduce this to a minimal error case, and I really have no idea as to what might be going wrong, having never before seen this behavior of missing events.  It is conceivable that the difference is not the kernel, but rather the build tools that I am tracing which is a combination of python  gcc.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 5871 pwe are working on a project where we are using Storm on HDInsight to analyze realtime data. We are using event hubs as input and output and we are having some problems passing the data through the topology. We are currently having one JavaSpout as input handler, one custom Bolt Bolt1 that is suppose to do some analysis on the data, and one JavaBolt that is suppose to take the analyzed data and send it to the output event hub. Passing data through the JavaSpout and JavaBolts works like a charm, but when we indroduce the custom Bolt the data gets encapsulated or something, its not showing what it should. the output is supposed to show a JSON string, but is shows some random stuff that looks like [B6d645e45p  pMost part of this is code from this tutorial a hrefhttpazure.microsoft.comsvsedocumentationarticleshdinsightstormdevelopcsharpeventhubtopology relnofollowhttpazure.microsoft.comsvsedocumentationarticleshdinsightstormdevelopcsharpeventhubtopologyap  pThis is our topology builderp  precodeTopologyBuilder topologyBuilder  new TopologyBuilderEventHubReaderTest          int partitionCount  Properties.Settings.Default.EventHubPartitionCount          JavaComponentConstructor constructor  JavaComponentConstructor.CreateFromClojureExpr             String.Formatcom.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.EventHubSpout. com.microsoft.eventhubs.spout.EventHubSpoutConfig.                   0 1 2 3 4 5,                 Properties.Settings.Default.EventHubPolicyName,                 Properties.Settings.Default.EventHubPolicyKey,                 Properties.Settings.Default.EventHubNamespace,                 Properties.Settings.Default.EventHubNameInput,                 partitionCount,                           topologyBuilder.SetJavaSpout             EventHubSpout,             constructor,             partitionCount          Listltstringgt javaSerializerInfo  new Listltstringgt  microsoft.scp.storm.multilang.CustomizedInteropJSONSerializer           topologyBuilder.SetBolt             bolten,             Bolt1.Get,             new Dictionaryltstring, Listltstringgtgt                              Constants.DEFAULTSTREAMID, new ListltstringgtEvent             ,             partitionCount.

Could anyone explain the reasoning for Area not being a valid key on its own p  pif anyone can help me out, be appreciated. p

With our test data random strings of 310 chars this works for up to 700 result rows per request. More, and we hit maxJsonLength, which is already set to codeInt32.Max3code.p  pWe strongare notstrong planning on displaying that many rows per page, but there might be binary data attached to the rows. That data could, even with 20 rows, easily go above the 2 MiB restriction implied by having to use an codeInt32code to set the max size.p  pSo is there any way to serialize objects with a length bigger than 2Mp

Negative 5871 pI have an Android app that serves as a GUI to a little daemon written in C that needs to run on an variety of mobileembedded linux devices.  The daemon needs to collect GPS data and pass it to several clients android phones, each with a GUI.  The daemon needs to be capable of running on one of the same Android devices that is being used as the GUI, but Im having a lot of trouble accessing GPS data from the C daemon.p  pIve looked into two options so farp  p1 strongThe stay native methodstrong Ive heard that gpsd exists for Android such as here a hrefhttpesr.ibiblio.orgp4886 relnofollowhttpesr.ibiblio.orgp4886a, but it seems elusive andor not existent on my Samsung Galaxy SII, running Cyanogenmod 10.1.3i9100 Android 4.2.2.  My standalone toolchain built from the NDK doesnt seem to have anything gpsrelated at all, even though sites like this one a hrefhttpwww.jayway.com20100125boostingandroidperformanceusingjni relnofollowhttpwww.jayway.com20100125boostingandroidperformanceusingjnia indicate that java uses JNI wrappers to use C code to talk to the GPS anyway.p  p2 strongThe jni methodstrong GPS seems really easy in Android Java applications, so I started looking into the JNI Im pretty new to Android and Java, by the way.  It is supposed to proved a way for C code and Java code to interact, right  I read up on it at this site a hrefhttpjournals.ecs.soton.ac.ukjavatutorialnative1.1implementingindex.html relnofollowhttpjournals.ecs.soton.ac.ukjavatutorialnative1.1implementingindex.htmla and this site a hrefhttpjournals.ecs.soton.ac.ukjavatutorialnative1.1implementingindex.html relnofollowhttpjournals.ecs.soton.ac.ukjavatutorialnative1.1implementingindex.htmla and a bunch of others.  But it occurs to me I havent seen any C code using the JNI that has a codemaincode function in it.  Also, the codeJNICreateJavaVMcode function is commented out in the codejni.hcode header file of my NDK toolchain.  In fact, I cant figure out how to have a valid codeJNIEnvcode in the first place.  The conclusion Ive come to is that JNI code is meant to be used by Java applications that need C support, not C applications that need Java support.  Is that correctp  pAnd then I have a third thought, which I dont like very muchp  p3 strongthe backup methodstrong In the instances where the C daemon is running on an Android phone, perhaps it could ask the android GUI for GPS data, then broadcast that to the other clients Im thinking they might communicate through a socket or something simple.  This seems like a really ugly solution though, because on top of seeming inefficient, the daemon should be able to run independent of any GUI, but now it would depend on the GUI for GPS data.p  pSo my real question is, has anybody else ran into this problem and found a suitable answer  Or perhaps there is something I am not understanding something aobut gpsd in Android, or about JNI in Androidp  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 5871 pIm studying IOSSwift development and Id like to build an IOS app that in the future will have its own Today Extension. Ive read that it is better to put the common logic for example the logic that accesses Internet resources, performs some job on the result etc between the App and its extension into a Custom Framework.. Since I think Ill need to change both Framework and App code during the development of the App, Id like to avoid building the framework in a separate project, than use Show In Finder function to locate the framework bundle and then draganddropping it within the App project.. So Id like to know if this is the correct way to set up a Workspace with an App, the framework it uses and the Today Extension of the Appp  ol liemCreate a new Project with an IOS App targetemli liemSelect the project in the Project Navigatorem and then emEditorAdd Target...em and specify a emCocoa Touch Frameworkemli liemEditorAdd Target...em and specify emToday Extensionemli liemAdd the framework in Linked Frameworks and Librariesemli ol  pIn this way Ive seen that changes to the Framework sources do not need a Framework target recompilation, maybe because the project knows about the need to recompile framework sources even if I only build amp run the IOS App target that uses that framework Am I doing it right Ive seen that the Today Extension created in such way does not lists the framework in the emBuild Phases  Target Dependenciesem while the IOS App does, but both of them correctly use the updated code of the Framework when I update it.p  pThen, Ive noticed the following warning when I compile the project, but I dont know if it is related to the way Ive setup the projectp  precodeld warning linking against dylib not safe for use in application extensions UsersgianniLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataTestFrameworkAppdshihhfiuepeqzddbnpgnfwilhemBuildProductsDebugiphonesimulatorTestFramework.frameworkTestFramework codepre  pBTW is it normal that the entries within the emProductsem folder are always red Is it due to the fact that I build only for IOS Simulator since I dont have a Paid developer account that allows me to build for an IOS Device Does this prevent me to build a framework that can be exported for some other Project since I cant find the Framework bundle with a right clicking on the framework product and selecting emShow In Finderem and so I cant draganddrop it to another projectp  pI hope Ive been clear enough and that youll point me in the right direction to understand what is the suggested way of starting my new project p
Negative 5871 pAfter we move from TFS VC to Git as the repository on our VSO subscription, we got the following cenario.p  pFrom a given remote repository on VSO named strongRepoAstrong, after the initial clone, it presents on team explorer to me the strongmainstrong branch for this repo. p  pThen I created a branch strongmyBranchstrong from the strongmainstrong branch locally.

Therefore I built it with .NET 4.5.p  pI have the latest version of the MySQL connector installed on my developing machine to work with .NET 4.5, but 3.5 doesnt like it because the connector requires 4.5.p  pHere are my questionsp  ul liIs it safe to uninstall the newer MySQL connector, since the reference DLLs have already been copied to that project, without breaking my 4.5 projectli liIs it a better idea to just run both off of the older connector versionli ul  pId test this out myself but Im in a position where I dont have admin rights. I have to bother IT anytime I want to do anything, and they generally like it if I know what Im doing before I go talk to them.p  pThanks all.p

Negative 5871 pIm writing a program in Netbeans which I today realized didnt work as I wanted it to. The idea of the program is to take what the user put in, create an object with the data and then store this object in an array. This happens when pressing a button. When pressing another button the content of the array is displayed on an jTextArea. The problem with this, I have now realized, is that the object that gets added to the array, gets removed when adding another object and I cant figure out why.p  pThis is my codeclasscode for creating objectsp  precodepublic class Car      public String brand     public String year    public Car String brand, String year        this.brand  brand       this.year  year       codepre  pAnd this the the codep  precodeint b  1 Car[] carArray  new Car[b]  private void btnAddActionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                                          TODO add your handling code here     int a  0      carArray[a]  new Car txtfBrand.getText, txtfYear.getText     a     b                                          private void btnReadActionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                                               TODO add your handling code here     for int i  0 i lt carArray.length i          txtaRead.append  carArray[i].Brand  n  carArray[i].Year  nn         lblSize.setText  carArray.length       codepre  pWhat the code above does is to create an array, codecarArraycode, which is one codeCarcodeobject big. When the user then presses the button codebtncode a codeCarcode is created with the values from codetxtfBrandcode and codetxtfYearcode and stored in the codecarArraycode on index 0. The array codecarArraycode is then increased to be two codeCarcodeobjects big, and the next object that is created is stored at index 2 and so on... Or so I thought the code worked...p  pBut when I press the codereadcodebutton, only the last object I created is displayed which must mean that its only one object in the codecarArraycode. When printing out the size of the codecarArraycode on the codelblSizecode, it is always 1. I dont understand why this happens, and any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 5871 pIm new here. I have spent the entire day trying to figure out what is wrong with my code. Yes, it might be a simple questions for you, since I just started JavaSript about a month ago. Anyways, your help in identifying the error in my code is greatly appreciatedp  pp  pThe Questionp  pCode a function called extremeValue. It takes 2 parameters. The first is an array of integers you do not need to validate this. The second parameter is either the String Minimum or Maximum. The function returns the minimum or maximum element value in the array depending on the second parameters value.p  pDo not use Math.min or Math.max. The standard algorithm for finding a minimum value in an array is to assume the first element at index 0 is the current minimum. Then process the array repetitively from its second element to its last. On each iteration compare the current element being processed with the current minimum. If its less than the minimum set it as the current minimum. In this way at the end of processing the current minimum holds the minimum element value in the array. A similar process will work for finding the maximum. Test your code. 1 markp  pThis function does two different jobs depending on its second parameter.

Negative 5871 pHere is a simplistic view of my tables and needs. Table A. Pickerid, Grade, Weight, Datep  pTable B. Pickerid, Grade, Weightset to zerop  pTable B was defined to have all pickers from 1 to 50 along with every grade possible. PR, AP, AA, AM, CA, And a default value of 0 for each grade. IE  Picker1 PR 0 Picker1 AP 0 Picker1 AA 0 etc etc for all 50 pickers.p  pNote that in Table A. A picker will have many boxes per day with the same grades but with different box weights. They will not necessary have all the grades possible so if a grade is not present then I need to have a 0 returned along side the grade. I need to Sum the weights per picker, per grade and if a grade is not present in Table A then the default is used from Table B.p  pThis is in MS Access 2010 using Sql.p  pI have tried Inner, Outer joins, unions, but can not get the result needed.p  pApprciate your experticep

Negative 5871 pIm not finding any actual guides as to implement the Single Sign Out CAS feature on my apps. Ive tried a number of answers here on SO, but none workedlike a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28891653singlesignoutwithspringsecurityandcasthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9834710springsecurityandcasintegrationthisa. Also, theres no examples to be found of the Spring SecurityCAS using the Java configuration, so im also a bit lost on that. I cannot even figure out if this is the actual URL that i should be using, as the documentation tells me to use jspringsecuritylogout, and thats just redirecting me to a blank index page, as my index page is working if i access it normallyalbeit the console shows all the correct requests, like the JS and CSS. Would really appreciate some guidance, as theres NO documentation that i could find that are using the Java annotation.

Negative 5871 pThis is a tricky question to make you understand but let me attempt it.p  pToday, I have 8 different portlets in my page and when global search box is triggered I fire 8 GSA queries to show each result set onto the respective portlet.p  pThe difference between each of the GSA call are the collection namesp  pNow I could not manage to think of a solution to replace 8 different GSA calls with one call.p  pEach collection has atleast 100k documents and the max result a GSA search response can give is only 1000 and 100 per requestcall. So it is quite impossible for me to parse the entire XML set and programmatically group them.p  pI know it is a poor design to show 8 different portlets with 8 different queries so Im not looking for help from that angle. The design is robust is an assumption. Could you think of anything creative to address this logic Thank you very much in advance and thank you for reading my question.p

Negative 5871 pThere are some variations on this question on SO and floating around the web already but theyre a bit different and dont have conclusive answers.p  pBasically, Id like to change the UI Router state when a modal is opened. Then, I want two things to happen....p  pA If the user hits the back button Id like the modal to be dismissed and the URL to go back to the previous state but without reloading the previous state controller etc. I just want the overlay and modal removed because the previous state is already underneath the overlay and might have a form which the user is in the process of filling in for instancep  pB If the user dismisses the modal Id like the same to happen, the URL should change back to the previous one the modal could have been opened from anywhere so we cant hard code the state that it will return to and the modal should close.p  pA can almost be solved by using this code...p  precodeApp.run[   rootScope, modalStack,    functionrootScope, modalStack      rootScope.onstateChangeStart, function        var top  modalStack.getTop       if top          modalStack.dismisstop.key                ] codepre  pbut that will close the modal even if opening another popup on top of the current one because it doesnt know if were moving forward or backwards. Basically we want to say has the user hit the back button or has the state transitioned ot the previous state, if so, close the top modal.p  pB Im not sure how to solve. We could force a state change back to the previous state when the modal is dismissed If we knew what the previous state was, but the code for A above would then get triggered and possibly remove another modal from the stack. Also, the previous state would get reinitiated. Basically we want to just want to go back to the previous URL when the modal is closed, but without doing a full state change, if that makes sensep  pLike I say, there are some semi solutions out there, but nothing which seems to handle the above scenarios. Anybody got any ideasp

Negative 5871 pI am facing issues storing to Local Storage in AngularJS. I am developing an ECommerce mobile appication using Ionic Framework and displaying Product data using ngrepeat. Each of the ionitem has product details and a button which is associated with addItem in TodoController.On the click of the button, the product data gets stored into Local Storage. However, the issue is that, whenever i click through a series of buttons, only the last product whose button is clicked gets stored in local storage and the previous clicked buttons data doesnt.p  precodelta classitem itemthumbnailleft hrefgt         ltimg ngsrcproduct.featuredimage.sourcegt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolgt                 lth3gtltspan ngbindproduct.IDgtltspangtlth3gt                 lth3gtltspan ngbindproduct.titlegtltspangtlth3gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolgt                 ltpgtproduct.metafields.woo.currencysymbolproduct.metafields.woo.priceltpgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolgt                 ltpgtQtyltpgt                                   ltselect nginitquantity  1 ngmodelquantitygt                         ltoption value1gt1ltoptiongt                         ltoption value2gt2ltoptiongt                         ltoption value3gt3ltoptiongt                         ltoption value4gt4ltoptiongt                         ltoption value5gt5ltoptiongt                         ltoption value6gt6ltoptiongt                         ltoption value7gt7ltoptiongt                         ltoption value8gt8ltoptiongt                         ltoption value9gt9ltoptiongt                         ltoption value10gt10ltoptiongt                         ltoption value11gt11ltoptiongt                         ltoption value12gt12ltoptiongt                         ltoption value13gt13ltoptiongt                         ltoption value14gt14ltoptiongt                         ltoption value15gt15ltoptiongt                     ltselectgt                 ltdivgt           ltdiv classcolgtltdivgt          ltdiv classcol ngcontrollerTodoControllergt             ltbutton ngclickaddItemproduct.ID, product.title,none , product.metafields.woo.price,  quantitygtAdd Meltbuttongt             ltdivgt        ltdivgt     ltagt codepre  pControllerp  precode.controllerTodoController, functionscope      scope.saved  localStorage.getItemtodos   scope.todos  localStorage.getItemtodosnull  JSON.parsescope.saved  []   localStorage.setItemtodos, JSON.stringifyscope.todos      scope.addItem  function id,item,size,price,quantity          scope.todos.pushid,item,size,price,quantity         localStorage.setItemtodos, JSON.stringifyscope.todos        codepre

Negative 5871 pIm moving my first steps with codetheanocode and I cannot figure out how to solve this problem which could be actually very easy. p  pI have a code3  4  2code tensor, like the followingp  precode[1 1]  [2 2]  [3 3] [1 1]  [2 2]  [3 3] [0 0]  [2 2]  [3 3] [9 9]  [0 0]  [3 3] codepre  pSo I have codeN3code sequences, each of them of length codeL4code with their elements that are vectors of dimension coded2code. Actually, the sequences can be of different length but I could think of padding them with code[0 0]code vectors, as shown above. p  pWhat I want to do is, first scan through the first axis of the tensor and sum up all the vector in the lists strongup to the the first [0 0] vectorstrong  thats why I added the [9 9] at the end of the first tensor slice, in order to check the sum exit condition [1]. I should end up in code[[2 2], [6 6], [12 12]]code. I tried in many ways to solve this problem which seems to me emjustem a nested looping problem... but always got some weird errors[2].p  pThanks,br Giulio  p  pbr [1] the actual problem is the training of a recurrent neural network for NLP purposes, with codeNcode the dimension of the batch, codeLcode the max length of a sentence in the batch and codedcode the dimension of the representation of each word. I omitted the problem so that I could focus on the simplest coding aspect.br [2] I omit the history of my failures, maybe I could add them later.p

Negative 5871 pI recently got bit in the butt with this codep  precodestdsizet s  10 stdvectorltintgt vs codepre  pRather than initialize with a size of 10, this initializes with a size of 1 with one element code10code. However, the vector has an explicit constructor that takes a codestdsizetcode. With all the hype about use braces everywhere, I would expect many people have fallen into this trap. This could be avoided if the compiler simply warned that we were trying to turn a codesizetcode into an codeintcode.p  pWhy isnt the compiler required to do thisp  pstrongEDITstrong My original code had codeconst stdsizet scode.
