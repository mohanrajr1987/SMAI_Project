Positive 11272 pUsing Spring Security 4.02, can anyone help with some tips on how I can handle codeUsernameNotFoundExceptioncode from codePreAuthenticatedAuthenticationProvidercode when using multiple codeAuthenticationProviderscode so that authenticated requests, with the correct header, but which are unauthorized, are sent to a specific URL instead of the formslogin pagep  pLet me explain further what Im trying to accomplish for accessing a web app being secured by SSO behind a proxy. Not all users who are authenticated by SSO will have access to this app. So I need to account for 3 access scenariosp  ol liauthenticated user header is present is authorized usernameroles are present in apps dbli liauthenticated user header is present is unauthorized usernameroles are strongnotstrong present in apps dbli liunauthenticated user with usernameroles present in apps dbli ol  pThe actions when accessing the website should bep  ol liauthenticatedauthorized user proceeds directly to target URLli liauthenticatedunauthorized user is redirected to errorinfo pageli liunauthenticated user is redirected to formslogin page for authenticationli ol  pWith my current configuration, scenarios 1 amp 3 appear to be working as desired. For scenario 2 Ive tried setting codeRequestHeaderAuthenticationFiltersetExceptionIfHeaderMissingcode to both true and false. p  pIf codesetExceptionIfHeaderMissingfalsecode, authenticatedunauthorized request is handled by codeExceptionTranslationFiltercode where codeAccessDeniedExceptioncode is thrown and user is redirected to formslogin page. p  pIf codesetExceptionIfHeaderMissingtruecode, authenticatedunauthorized request encounters codePreAuthenticatedCredentialsNotFoundExceptioncode from codeAbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter.doAuthenticatecode and HTTP 500 is returned.p  pSo Ive read and reread the Spring Security reference and api documents and scoured the web and just cant quite figure out what I need to do.

Since filters dont get invoked in my application, the requestresponse objects never get wrapped. I suspect that the above error is related to this.p  pI guess that since I have my own Servlet class that extends the Spring Servlet, it is in essence saying to Spring that I will take control from there.

Positive 11272 pWe are trying to build a Spring web application with Kerberos authentication.  Our dev machine is part of a corporate AD domain. We have a local KDC in a VM to test kerberos, but does not have a trust with the AD. Network Identity manager is able to get a ticket from this realm in addition to the ticket from the AD. p  pWhen tested from the browser, it seems like the ticket from domain login is sent to the server, instead of the ticket for the test realm, failing with unknown client principal and falls back to NTLM. p  pThe host where the tomcat server and test KDC are running are added to the trusted sites, with automatic authentication enabled for trusted sites. Adding it to local intranet also did not make a difference. p  pWill it be possible from any of the browsers to send appropriate ticket for the realm obtained through Network Identity manager instead of the current logged in AD user ticket p

Positive 11272 pI am trying to implement OAuth2 into my Spring Boot app.  When making a call to oauthtoken using a password grant, I am able to authenticate using Basic auth with a usernamepassword against a database.

Why doesnt C just have short float, float and long float And where on earth did double come fromp  pEDIT It seems the relationship between floating types is similar to that of integers. double must be at least as big as float, and long double is at least as big as double. No other guarantees of precisionrange are made.p

Negative 11272 pIm working on this game titled Fortress, located at a hrefhttpwww.joemajewski.comfortress relnofollowhttpwww.joemajewski.comfortressa. Anyways, its one of those browserbased roleplaying games where players build an army and upgrade their stats to get a high ranking on the leaderboard.p  pEvery 30 minutes a cron job is going to execute, which makes some updates. It loops through each player of the game which will continue to rise naturally over time as more people join, and updates certain stats. It gives everyone 1 extra turn, gives them gold based on their income, food, wood, copper, iron, etc..., plus it updates their ranking.p  pThats all mumbojumbo, I know, but the point is that each player is going to have their own update query. I timed the script with just three membersp  pexecution time with mysqlquery function commented out for the updates  3.5 msp  pexecution time with mysqlquery function working properly  14 msp  pIt is clearly the update queries that are going to cause my cron job to get very slow once the game has 100 registered members. I am hoping to have 100 active players within two weeks of the games launch, but many players create multiple accounts, so I expect at least 200 members after a couple weeks. With 200 update queries, plus the extra time to sort members and calculate rankings, it will likely take over 2 seconds to run the cron job.p  pMy question to you. Is there a faster way to do something like this I tried adding a START TRANSACTION and COMMIT queries before and after the loop, respectively, but its hard to gauge speed with just 3 members. Will transactions make the script better or worse Any other way around this Any help would be appreciated.p  pThank you very much for taking the time to listen to my plea.p
Negative 11272 pIm looking for any adviceintuitioncluesanswers on a permission issue that has been plaguing me ever since I switched over to a new Macbook pro. Heres the dilemma. Certain programs copy libraries under usrlocallib during install and upon running these programs I get a crash which I believe is related to permission restrictions to files in this folder. Ive had errors cant access files from this path trying to install plugins for audacity and then tried doing an ls under this folder. I immediately get permission denied unless I prefix the cmd with sudo. Ive tried owning the usrlocallibaudacity folder with my user account and even still I get permissions errors on these files. Its important to note that the problem is not exclusive to Audacity. Ive seen the same problem with Polycom video conference software and Ive also been unable to run Parallels on this machine. I havent traced Parallels to the same issue but Im betting its related. I vaguely recall some weird Linux cmd magic I used to use back in the day that would not only grant permission to a user but tweak some low level bits allowingdisabling certain things like execution and I seem to recall the permission thing ran deeper than execution but its been years. I cant recall the detils and Im wondering if theres something similar on OS X that Im possibly overlooking. Is there something special about that location and the files there in Could I have somehow altered my file system in a way tht the files appear different For what its worth, I seem to be able to use at least one of the programs if I log in as root. I havent tried with the other programs as Ive just discovered the ability. Please help.p

Negative 11272 pIve been working on an AES CUDA application and I have a kernel which performs ECB encryption on the GPU. In order to assure the logic of the algorithm is not modified when running in parallel I send a known input test vector provided by NIST and then from host code compare the output with the know test vector output provided by NIST with an assert. I have run this test on my NVIDIA GPU which is a 8600M GT. This is running under Windows 7 and the driver version is 3.0. Under this sceneario everything works perfect and the assert succeeds.p  pNow, when the application is run on a Quadro FX 770M. The same application is launched, the same test vectors are sent but the result obtained is incorrect and the assert fails. This runs on Linux with the same driver version The kernels are executed by 256 threads. Within the kernels and to skip arithmetic pre computed lookup tables of 256 elements are used. These tables are originally loaded in global memory, 1 thread out of the 256 threads launching the kernel colaborate in loading 1 element of the lookup table and moves the element into a new lookup table in shared memory so access latency is decreased. p  pOriginally, I thought about syncrhonization problems due to Clock speed differences between GPUs. So may be threads were using values still not loaded into shared memory or somehow values which were still not processed, making the output to mess up and finally get it incorrect. p  pIn here the known test vectors are declared, so basically they are sent to AESsetencrption which is in charge to setup the kernelp  precodevoid testvectors       unsigned char testPlainText[]   0x6b, 0xc1, 0xbe, 0xe2, 0x2e, 0x40, 0x9f, 0x96, 0xe9, 0x3d, 0x7e, 0x11, 0x73, 0x93, 0x17, 0x2a       unsigned char testKeyText[]   0x60, 0x3d, 0xeb, 0x10, 0x15, 0xca, 0x71, 0xbe, 0x2b, 0x73, 0xae, 0xf0, 0x85, 0x7d, 0x77,0x1f, 0x35, 0x2c, 0x07, 0x3b, 0x61, 0x08, 0xd7, 0x2d, 0x98, 0x10, 0xa3, 0x09, 0x14, 0xdf, 0xf4      unsigned char testCipherText[]  0xf3, 0xee, 0xd1, 0xbd, 0xb5, 0xd2, 0xa0, 0x3c, 0x06, 0x4b, 0x5a, 0x7e, 0x3d, 0xb1, 0x81, 0xf8   unsigned char out[16]  0x0      AES Encryption AESsetencrption testPlainText, out, 16, u32testKeyText   Display encrypted data  printfn  GPU Encryption    for int i  0 i lt AESBLOCKSIZE i          printfx, out[i]   Assert that the encrypted output is the same as the NIST testCipherText vector   assert memcmp out, testCipherText, 16  0  codepre  pIn here the setup function is in charge to allocate memory, call the kernel and send the results back to the hos.

Negative 11272 pI have a database table of people which is quite basic name address age etc each with a unique ID personID.

Also bonus points if you can give me tips on how to implement properties so i can do code likep  precodePersonA.Properties[Age]  22 codepre

Negative 11272 pIve discovered YAML recently and it has turned out to be a fantastic format for my project Im creating a textbased RPG. Its handling everything I need flawlessly  area files rooms with descs, exits, objs, npcs, etc, script files, npc files, object files... it tackles them all Theres just one thing...p  pWhen updating values in these files I of course need to write them back to disk to keep the changes. Unfortunately YAMLs dump method really makes a mess of things. First it alphabetizes all the keys, and then it appears to put one kv pair per line. This effectively took a file with 5 lines and turned it into 94 lines.p  pIve tried writing the YAML objects back to disk using write but it throwsp  precodeTypeError expected a character buffer object codepre  pat me. Pickle would save it, but I think that would destroy the YAMLness of the data. Is there a good way to save a YAML object without dump Ive heard mention of SQLite, would that work the same as YAML I have little to no database experience but it seems like YAML objects are basically databases. Would it be worth recoding everything to use SQLite Is it easy to save changed values with it, unlike the problem I have having nowp  pAny assistance here would be great. I love YAML a lot. I strugged for a long time trying to find a way to store all the data I need for my game and when I found YAML it was as if it glowed with holy light as a chorus of angels sang their glory upon it  so you can understand if Id first like to know of a way to save YAML data to disk without using dump.

Negative 11272 pIm  new to objectiveC so, bear with me. I started with the Universal App template in Xcode4 and built my application. There is a convention that the template starts you off with that I tried to stick with. For each View Controller, theres a main file and a subclass for each device type. For examplep  precodeProject     ExampleViewController.hm      iPhone        ExampleViewControlleriPhone.hmxib      iPad        ExampleViewControlleriPad.hmxib codepre  pFor the most part, this is pretty convenient. Most of the logic goes in the superclass and the subclasses take care of any device specific implementation.p  pHeres the part I dont get.

For examplep  pExampleViewControlleriPhonep  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      Content selectedContent  Content [[self fetchedResultsController] objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     ContentDetailViewControlleriPhone detailViewController  [[ContentDetailViewControlleriPhone alloc] init]     detailViewController.content  selectedContent     detailViewController.managedObjectContext  self.managedObjectContext      [self.navigationController pushViewControllerdetailViewController animatedYES]     [detailViewController release]  codepre  pExampleViewControlleriPadp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      Content selectedContent  Content [[self fetchedResultsController] objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     ContentDetailViewControlleriPad detailViewController  [[ContentDetailViewControlleriPad alloc] init]     detailViewController.content  selectedContent     detailViewController.managedObjectContext  self.managedObjectContext      [self.navigationController pushViewControllerdetailViewController animatedYES]     [detailViewController release]  codepre  p... notice that in the second instance the only thing different is that its loading the codeiPadcode version of the View Controller. This is necessary because the codeiPadcode and codeiPhonecode view controllers are attached to separate, device specifc nibs.p  pWhats the correct pattern for doing thisp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5191472iosusingdevicemodifiersforloadingxibfiles51981335198133this answera about loading separate xibs using device modifiers which seems like it could help in the case where I dont need a specific subclass for one device, but it still wont help if I need to instantiate a specific codeiPhonecode or codeiPadcode instance of a view controller for device specific functionality.p

Negative 11272 pI am trying to set a field in SP to a certain value, which depends on certain date values and one field where we require a list of dates to be entered by the user, not a standard date picker. Now the fly in the ointment here is the look up field for the list of dates we require. I initially made a list of dates, in string format but we need to compare dates so that solution is too messy. p  pWe also need a rollingdynamic date comparison for some of the calculations, so for instance users pick a date from the list of dates and it is compared against the first and last day of the next three months that is the values in the date list drop down. I initially made calculated date columns with the old Today trick and text conversion of the date columns so that I could do a workflow to check if the picked date text format was equal to the respective date text value.p  pI quickly realised this will fail spectacularly when the month changes as the date columns calculated from the illustrious Today will not update for existing records so if someone changes a date from an existing record it will be looking at potentially the previous month or before, depending on how long it has been there, but I always require a list of six dates first and last day from the current and next 2 months.p  pCan anyone suggest how to getp  ul liA look up column with a list of six dates that are in date format not string li liSix variablescolumns that have corresponding dates for current and next two months that automatically updates to reflect the new month, and so increments all the dates one month forward and updating the day and year dynamicallyli ul  pORp  ul liSome sort of work flow comparison where I can check the range that the date is in from look up, although I still need to check against these dates or between these dates anyway.li ul  pThis is a real head scratcher and would really appreciate some help with this as I cannot find any noncomplex code solutions, I do not have time to learn new languages if possible. I only have basic SQLExcelAccessSP coding knowledge and some VBJava and a taste of some other coding platforms.p  pThanksp  pAp

Negative 11272 pI am having a problem with a web app that Im working on and I have posted a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8713814shouldhtml5cachemanifestworkwithajaxrequeststooherea which is a bit vague and probably not very helpful. I have decided to create a really basic site and build it up to be like the main app and see where it breaks. I have done this and got stuck straight away with the offline caching.p  pThis is a basic 3 page static website hosted locally in IIS 7.5. I created the folder cinetpubwwwrootManifestTesting, added it to IIS as a web application and added a new MIME type of textcachemanifest for the .appcache extension. I am also using FireFox 9.0 for testing as this has an offline mode feature.p  pI created 3 html pages and added them to the ManifestTesting folderp  ul liindex.htm  this page contains 2 links to page1.htm and page2.htmli lipage1.htm  just contains a header that says page 1li lipage2.htm  just contains a header that says page 2li ul  pSo now if I browse to a hrefhttplocalhostmanifesttesting relnofollowhttplocalhostmanifesttestinga if get the index page and can navigate to the 2 pages.p  pI then created a file called manifest.appcache and added it to the ManifestTesting folderp  precodeCACHE MANIFEST  CACHE index.htm page1.htm page2.htm codepre  pand added the reference to the manifest file in the index.htmp  precodelthtml manifestmanifest.appcachegt codepre  pSo if I clear all history and browse to the index.htm, FireFox asks if I want to allow the website to store data for offline use. I click allow, switch the browser to offline mode then attempt to navigate to page1.htm which works fine So all is good so far.p  pNow for the bit that I dont understand. I then created a new folder in the ManifestTesting folder called pages and moved page1 and page2 into it. I updated the links in the index to reference the new location and if I browse the website without the manifest reference, it all works fine just as before. I then rereference the manifest file in the index and update the manifest to be likep  precodeCACHE MANIFEST  CACHE index.htm pagespage1.htm pagespage2.htm codepre  pI then clear history, refresh, firefox asks to allow the website to store offline data, enable offline mode and then attempt to navigate to page1  it doesnt work FireFox tells me its in offline mode and cant browse the webp  pWhat am I doing wrongp

Negative 11272 pWe have a requirement to make our products work on Oracle as well as SQL Server around which they were originally built. Unfortunately we dont have any in house Oracle development experience to speak of but as a senior dev it has fallen to me to lead the project. So far I have managed to make our app connect to an Oracle database Im using Oracle XE 11.2 by using the following connection stringp  precodeData SourceDESCRIPTIONADDRESSPROTOCOLTCPHOSTVS010ORA11GR1PORT1523CONNECTDATASERVICENAMEDEVORAUser IddboPassworddbo codepre  pThe reason we decided to use this type of connection string is because we do not want to rely on changing tnsnames.ora on every client machine. However, as you can see this specifies an Oracle user and associated password. We also need to provide the ability to use the equivalent of SQL Server integrated security.p  pAccording to the literature I have read, to do this I simply need to specify codecode as the user id and then omit the password portion as this is ignored anyway for Windows authentication. I also created the user in Oracle, making sure it matched the Windows user, with the following snippetsp  precodeCREATE USER OPSltDOMAINgtltusergt IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY  GRANT CONNECT,RESOURCE TO OPSltDOMAINgtltusergt codepre  pI also checked that the sqlnet.ora file on my local machine which hosts the XE instance and my dev environment contained the linep  precodeSQLNET.AUTHENTICATIONSERVICES NTS codepre  pI understood that this would enable my app to connect to the Oracle database uing Windows Authentication. However what actually happens is that I get the following Oracle error messagep  blockquote   pORA01005 null password given logon deniedp blockquote  pthis doesnt make much sense because of course its null  its supposed to be, according to the tutorials Ive read. p  pThe app targets .Net Framework 3.5, we are using the System.Data.OracleProvider  and the actual connecting and so on is handled by Enterprise Library 5. Incidentally, I am aware of the deprecation of the OracleClient component but I just want this to work before I go into the extra complexities of changing providers.p  pCan anyone tell me what Im missing Have I chosen the wrong type of connection string I apologise for any basic mistakes but I have always managed to avoid Oracle until now so my knowledge of it is close to zero.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 11272 pI have the following problem. I use an old Windows XP laptop as some sort of a wireless router by creating an adhoc wireless network. It works OK with my Win7 laptop, but when I brought my MacBook Pro from work I realized that although it finds and connects to the network, all it could actually show were a few Google services, and nothing else.p  pSomeone told me that I should experiment with reducing the MTU on the Mac. I did so and it worked  I reduced it from 1500 to 1272 and it worked.p  pthe problem is still that another WinXP machine has basically the same accessibility problems as the MacBook had, and there I cannot really mess with the MTU settings. Same applies for my iPod touch, which I have to jailbreak in order to mess with the MTU. Plus, the MacBook occasionally goes back to 1500 by itself, and it is very annoying to reset it every single time.p  pThe strangest thing is that I created this adhoc network in the most standard way possible using the XP wizards, without making ay funky configuration or something. Yet, as it seems, it doesnt even allow a Win XP machine to connect to another Win XP machine.p  pPlease, help. I really need to use this laptop as a router, and currently buying a standard WiFi one is not an option.p

It seems like pusher is well supported on Heroku so Im thinking about using Pusher.p  pBefore I jump on, I just wanted to make sure I understand things correctly. Is Pusher like a Heroku for push requests My option is to either host everything on Heroku including Juggernaut or Faye module, or just host the static part of the site on Heroku and delegate push notification handling to pusher.p  pFrom what I know, this feels like a more efficient approach since 1. If I use pusher, I dont have to jump through all the hoops in order to run juggernautfaye modules on Heroku. 2.

Negative 11272 pI have a Java application where the domain layer is decoupled from the UI by controllers. The problem is that these controllers can return domain objects, and can have domain objects as parameters. p  pSome of these returned domain objects are mutable, and this is what I want to prevent. I want it impossible for the UI or future UIs to directly modify the domain without accessing the controllers.p  pI tried two optionsp  ul lipIn the first one I made sure that each class implemented an Unmodifiable stronginterfacestrong which contained only getters. And if I needed to return an object to the UI, I returned its Unmodifiable interface. So that the UI could only view the getters. The problem with this that they still can be cast easily to the original object and access is gained. At first I thought that this level of security was good enough, but it happend that someone accidentally casted some objects and used them in an incorrect way, and integrity was breached.pli lipIn the second one I tried to provide unmodifiable strongwrappersstrong for each object that could be returned. But the problem is that these returned objects can be used as parameters for methods in the controllers and so they needed to be unwrapped in the controllers. I tried to make the codeuwrapcode methode packageprivate, but then I have to put every specific wrapper class in the same package with the controllers and this is a bit inconvenient.pli ul  pemEDIT 3th optionemp  ul liWith thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers579828vicvica In the third option the object is wrapped by a unmodifiable strongwrapperstrong, but cant be unwrapped by this wrapper. Each Unmodifiable is linked to its modifiable object in a Hashmap. So unwrapping is done by getting the modifiable object that is linked to the unmodifiable object.li ul  pDoes anyone know or has some ideas on emhow to make objects unmodifiable so they can be returned by a controller, and make it possible to make them modifiable again when they are passed back to the controllersemp

Negative 11272 pI would like to run Squid on a system with limited physical memory. The system should ideally do no page swapping. AFAIK, there are two ways to achieve thisp  ol lipModify routine codestoreDigestAddablecode  in file codestoredigest.ccode in conjunction with a trigger from codesbrkcode to stop caching files. In this case squid gracefully degrades to being just a proxy and does not do any caching. This saves us from memory bloat caused by caching of large files in memory.pli lipBypass new connections in conjunction with a trigger from codesbrkcode.pli ol  pBoth of these would require changing Squid code. Have you encounteredcontemplated this issue Is there a way to achieve this goal no swapping and limited physical memory by any other means It will be great if you can point me to any Squid configuration parameter that may help.p

Negative 11272 pEssentially Im trying to calculate the bisector line between two points.  Ive got two methods, one works the other doesnt.  I cant quite figure out why the other one doesnt work.  The one that works is a little more computationally intensive and since this routine is run a lot, Id like to use the simpler one... except it doesnt work.  Im probably missing something simple but I find this amusing since I seem to have a better grasp of trig than I do of high school algebra.p  pNote the function is passed the end points endPoint1, endPoint2. Heres the one that works using trig to calculate the bisectorp  precodeCGPoint midPoint  CGPointMakeendPoint1.x  endPoint2.x  2, endPoint1.y  endPoint2.y  2  Normalize an end point CGPoint nPoint  CGPointMakeendPoint1.x  endPoint2.x, endPoint1.y  endPoint2.y  Find theta and rotate 90 CGFloat theta  atanfnPoint.y  nPoint.x if nPoint.x lt 0.0f theta  MPI else if nPoint.x gt 0.0f ampamp nPoint.y lt 0.0f theta  MPI  2 theta  MPI2  Calculate another point along new theta and denormalize the point CGPoint centerPoint  CGPointMakecosftheta  10, sinftheta  10 centerPoint.x  midPoint.x centerPoint.y  midPoint.y  Create the line definition LineDef def  LineDefForPointsmidPoint, centerPoint codepre  pHeres the one that doesnt, but Id like it top  precodeCGPoint midPoint  CGPointMakeendPoint1.x  endPoint2.x  2, endPoint1.y  endPoint2.y  2 Calculate the slope and invert CGFloat m  endPoint1.y  endPoint2.y  endPoint1.x  endPoint2.x Take the negative reciprocal  m  1m         Calculate another point on the line         CGPoint centerPoint  CGPointMakemidPoint.x  10, midPoint.y  m  10 Create the line definition LineDef def  LineDefForPointsmidPoint, centerPoint codepre  pSo Id swear this should work.  The change in Y is equal to m times the change in x.  Ive calculated the mid point, figured out the slope of the perpendicular line and calculated another point on that line.  However the line definitions created arent equivalent when given the same end points, so Im missing something.p  pBy the way, LindeDef is a simple struct with three CGFloat variables for the a, b amp c components of a straight line.

Negative 11272 pI hope this is okay to ask here as its more a request for advice than a technical problem.p  pI have been developing a game using html5js and my goal was to make it multiplayer.  Its a dungeon crawling game and my intent is to have a main village where all players online and in the village can see each other going about and talk and form parties but when a player enters a dungeon its a seperate instance for them and their party.  Party size maxium of 4.p  pMy intention was to use websockets and write a server in c.  The problem is I just found out that IE does not support websockets and is still holding around 25 of the browser market share.p  pmy options seem to be to use websockets anyway and cut out the IE crowd or maybe drop multiplayer support.  Someone else suggested that I just write world data to a database and have players read from it every frame and update that way.. it sounds horriable.p  pI found this socket.io thing that seems like it can use websockets OR do the same deal in other ways  but how does this effect me writing a server  If I use the c implementation of websockets and socket.io will IE users be able to talk to my serverp  pOr there may be other ways of doing clientserver communication that I dont even know about.p  pTo be completely honest im tempted to drop the multiplayer idea  But before I do I look to you guys for advice and experienced suggestions on how I could handle this.  Thanks for your time and I hope this kind of question is okay here p

Negative 11272 pMy app is constantly crashing after receiving many memory warnings. It is almost thirty thousand lines of code long so it is not easy to track the problem. I have run it through instruments and there are up to 30MB of live bytes at some stages, which should not be too much of an issue as far as I am aware. The memory leaks are extremely minimal, so they can not be the problem. The app tends to crash after playing it for long periods of time. Nothing in instruments has helped me to track the source of the memory warnings I am constantly receiving. Is there any other possible way to do this It is very important that this doesnt happen for obvious reasons. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 11272 pWhile I am using PHPUnit to isolate and test the application code, our QA team has been testing the UI with Selenium.  I have heard that the tests are taking over 10 hours to complete, which I think is way too long.  My question then really concerns how to wait for AJAX calls when processing a page.p  pFor instance, we have a page that has numerous input, which will call AJAX calls to talk to our services for data to display.  We have multiple inputs that then filter subsequent select boxes as they are changed.  p  pDivisions are all loaded, as are districts which belong to division then stores which belong to districtsp  precodeDivision 1      District 10           Store 100           Store 101           Store 102      District 11           Store 200           Store 201           Store 202 Division 2      District 20           Store 300           Store 301           Store 302      District 21           Store 150           Store 151           Store 2002 ... codepre  pNow the select boxes are all initially loaded, so the end user may select in any of them.  However, once a select box has a selection made, the AJAX calls reload the other select boxes based on the parents selection.  IE Select Division 2, then  the District lists are filtered for just District 20 and 21 using calls to a service and the store lists are also filter  to just the stores for those districts.p  pIf you skip selecting Division, but select a district, then the store list is refiltered to just the stores for that district,  again using our services in the back end.p  pMy question is how to know when the AJAX call has returned from our service, and the select box has been changed  Our QA team is waiting, and then looping through the select box to check all the returned values are correct.  Is there a way for them to know when the select box is done reloading, so they could then check the contentsp  pObviously, I want to move most of these checks into the PHPUnit tests with Mock objects to validate our services work, but our QA team still wants to validate that the actual rendered results match.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 11272 pOK I want to be able test internal phone systems in an automated fashion using an Android app, the requirements are asking for an app which can initiate a call programatically. If this is possible then when the call starts they wish to be able to send key presses, like imagine the phone menu says press 5 to get to the X menu.. can we send that keypress from code This way the whole system could be tested with a series of waits, and keypresses sent to the dialler.p  pIm not sure how to find out if this is actually possible.. I saw PROCESSOUTGOINGCALLS, but I havent been able to find any resources or examples on doing this, does anyone have any information I actually got in touch with a freelancer who ended up saying it was definitely not possible hes pretty good and he simply said pressing dialpad during call was impossible, but my client is telling me apps already exist to do this, so any tips would be helpful.. p

Negative 11272 pI am working on a simple MonteCarlo simulation script, which I will later on extend for a larger project. The script is a basic crawler trying to get from point A to point B in a grid. The coordinates of point A is 1,1 this is top left corner, and the coordinates of point B is n,n this is bottom right corner, n is the size of the grid.p  pOnce the crawler starts moving, there are four options, it can go left, right, up or down no diagonal movement allowed. If any of these four options satisfy the followingp  ol liThe new point should still be within the boundries of the n x n gridli liThe new point should not be visited previouslyli ol  pthe new point will be selected randomly among the remaining valid options as far as I know Python uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm for picking random numbers.p  pI would like to run the simulation for 1,000,000 times the code below runs for 100 only, and each iteration should be terminated eitherp  ol liThe crawler gets stuck no valid options for movementli liThe crawler gets to the final destination n,n on the grid.li ol  pI thought I implemented the algorithm correctly, but obviously something is wrong.

Negative 11272 pIm trying to hide an implementation of a class I do not own. Im wanting to do this my extending the class and implementing an interface of my own. Here is how an instance of the class I need is createdp  precodeQueueInfo info  admin.getQueuequeueName codepre  pQueueInfo is the class I do not own. To get an instance of this object, I have to use an admin object to get it. I am wanting to hide this implementation by working through an interface called IQueueInfo. IQueueInfo will just give access to what consumers need from QueueInfo. So to get at this QueueInfo, I would like work through my own object called EMSQueueInfo. Here is how I envision setting this upp  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo      ...  codepre  pThis allows my consumer to work though the interface IQueueInfo and it allows the underlying EMSQueueInfo to have access to everything QueueInfo has. My problem lies with getting a live instance of QueueInfo. To get a regular instance of QueueInfo, I could just sayp  precodeQueueInfo info  new QueueInfoqueueName codepre  pThis instance is not live as in it was not created by the admin object. So, doing thisp  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo       public EMSQueueInfoString queueName         superqueueName        codepre  pdoes not give me a live object. What I would love to be able to do is something like thisp  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo       public EMSQueueInfoString queueName, Admin admin         super  admin.getQueuequeueName        codepre  pBut that is impossible.p  pThe only solution Im seeing is removing the extends from my EMSQueueInfo class and just wrapping the object up myself, getting access to all of the methods via a private varialbep  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo       private QueueInfo queueInfo      public EMSQueueInfoString queueName, Admin admin         queueInfo  admin.getQueuequeueName           public int getMessagesOnQueue          return queueInfo.getMessagesOnQueue        codepre  pThat solution does work, but I kind of hate it. Can anyone think of a better way Am I just trying to break OO and misuse it Again, Im only doing all of this because I want consumers to be able to work with IQueueInfo, in the future, IQueueInfo could be used to access a JMS implementation of QueueInfo or an MSMQ implementation of QueueInfo.

Negative 11272 pIm developing for Unity3D using C, and decided it would be useful to have an assert function. In Unity3D, codeSystem.Diagnostics.Debug.Assertcode emexistsem, but does nothing.p  pAs a developer that works primarily in C, Im used to assert messages that contain the asserted expression by way of the preprocessor stringizing operator. That is, given a failed assertion of the form codeASSERTx gt 0, x should not be zero.code, the message displayed at runtime message can include the text x  0. Id like to be able to do the same in C.p  pIm aware of ConditionalAttribute and DebuggerHiddenAttribute, and am using both although the latter seems to be ignored by the custom build of MonoDevelop bundled with Unity. While searching for a solution to this problem, I came across three attributes in the codeSystem.Runtime.CompilerServicescode namespace that seem related to what Im trying to do CallerFilePathAttribute, CallerLineNumberAttribute, and CallerMemberNameAttribute. In my implementation, I use codeSystem.Diagnostics.StackTracecode with codefNeedFileInfo  truecode instead.p  pIm wondering if there is perhaps any reflection magic seems unlikely or attribute magic seems slightly more likely that can help me achieve the same functionality as Im used to in C.p

Negative 11272 pI am developing an android app. I want my app to have a home button. So I decide to use a clickable ImageView for that, which I am placing in the title bar. Whenever a user clicks on the home image, the app will navigate to the home screen which I accomplish by having the image dispatch an intent to start the HomeActivity.p  pMy concern is that the whole approach feels like poor design I may be wrong. Basically all activities follow the HomeActivity. And since I dont normally call codefinishcode on my activities so to allow backbutton navigation would I end up in a loop As in, say a user goes from HomeActivity to FooActivity then to BarActivity then clicks on the home image hence going to HomeActivity. I know I can rely on android to reclaim memory when it needs it. But I dont want my app to tax the system so much.p  pSo how do android designers normally design codehomecode iconsbuttons so to avoid this looping problem Or is android aware that I am returning to HomeActivity and thus may finish the previous instances of the other activities I just walked throughp

Negative 11272 pI have a libgdx android project in eclipse which Ive added scala and AndroidProguardScala natures to. sThis was working great, but suddenly eclipse has started giving me the warning More than one Scala library found on the build path.s I can still build and install the project on a device, but it exits immediately with codeNoClassDefFoundError scala.Tuple2mcZZspcode, sso it looks like the Scala library isnt being included at all.sp  psMy project seems to have the Scala library both under Scala Library [2.10.1] as scalalibrary.jar and under Android Dependencies as scalalibrary.min.jar so I guess that the Proguard output is conflicting with the original library, but I have no idea why this has happened or how to fix it.sp  pAt this point I could just make a new project and copy the source files over, but it would be great if anyone could shed some light on this.p  pstrongEditstrong After some experimentation it turns out that this code from within a method of a trait seems to be causing the problem.p  precodeacckeys match    case true, false gt acceleration.set0, accel.rotaterotation   case false, true gt acceleration.set0, accel.rotaterotation   case  gt acceleration.set0, 0  codepre  pwhere acckeys is a function returning a codetuplecode and codeaccelerationcode is a vectorp  pThe multiple libraries warning is still there, so I guess that isnt related to to the problem.

I checked the MQ Mananer name on the first server, it was correct.li liIt is possible to connect from other servers to the first servers MQ Manager. li ol  pMore information that I doubt it is the source of my problem the first server running Windows 32 bits and the second one is running Windows 64 bits. Moreover the second one is fresh installed, so I think it might have problem with some sorts of permissions. However searching around didnt help me so far.p  pI really appreciate if someone here could shed some lights on my problem.

Negative 11272 pI have tables Crop, Corn, Soybean, and Grain. One entry in Crop corresponds to a single entry in one of the other tables. The problem here is that Crop should be onetoone with only one of the other tables, but not more than one. The Crop table is needed because it combines a lot of the common data from the other tables and makes querying the information much easier code side. From working on this I have a couple strategies with drawbacks...p  pA. Put three columns into Crop for the IDs of the other tables then populate the column Corn if its a corn crop ect...p  pDrawbacks Wasted columns, have to check all three columns whenever I want to see what crop it isp  pB. Combine Corn, Soybean, and Grain tables and add a single column for what type of crop it is.p  pDrawbacks Each table has different columns, wasted and unnecessary columns in each rowp  pIs it safe to say Im stuck here Or is there a strategy to handle cases like this Thanks.p

Negative 11272 blockquote   pstrongTHE SOLUTIONstrong   Ensure that youre not mistakenly importing the wrong class.p      pIn my case, I was explicitly importing TabButton, but there was   another TabButton class that was being imported because it existed in   the same directory as TabButtonSubclass. This happened because   TabButtonSubclass exists in a folder specific to one application. This   folder also contains a horribly generically named class, TabButton,   which is completely unrelated and incompatible to the other TabButton   class. The applicationspecific TabButton class was renamed so its   obvious it belongs to that application.p      pHad I written empublic class MBTabButtonSprited extends strong[specific   location]strong.TabButtonem, it would have worked fine. But it seems that   since emextends TabButtonem was not prefaced by a specific path, the   compiler defaulted to the local path.p blockquote  pIve been banging my head on my desk for a while now, trying to figure this one out.p  pMy issue is that Ive extended Sprite to create a TabButton class. I then extended the TabButton class well call it TabButtonSubclass for some additional functionality. When I try to cast an instance of TabButtonSubclass as TabButton, I get null.p  pThe bizarre part though, is that I can cast an instance of TabButton strongorstrong TabButtonSubclass as a Sprite, and it works fine.p  pHere is what my TabButton looks likep  precodeimport flash.display.Sprite  public class TabButton extends Sprite      public function TabButtonvoid          super          code       codepre  pAnd here is what my TabButtonSubclass looks likep  precodeimport ...TabButton  public class TabButtonSubclass extends TabButton       public function TabButtonSubclass bitmapBitmapData void           code         super        codepre  pstrongTo clarify the TabButtonSubclass classstrong The purpose of extending the TabButton was so that you could instantiate a TabButtonSubclass with a supplied Bitmap.

Negative 11272 pIm having an issue getting certain custom fonts to load.  I followed the advice in the traditional, 400 upvoted answer to this question, and it worked for one project perfectly.  However, in a different project I am working on I have run into issues with loading a UIFont.p  pThese issues are somewhat similar to the issues found in the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4245960addingmultiplefontstouiappfontsoverrideseachotherAdding multiple fonts to UIAppFonts overrides each othera.  The solution there was that there were issues with the plist properly parsing out the names into XML leading to overwriting.  I have attempted to test that hypothesis of the issuep  pI listed the fonts in my plist underp  pUIAppFonts which turns into Fonts provided by application Item 0  MerriweatherRegular.ttf Item 1  OpenSansRegular.ttf Item 2  OpenSansBold.ttfp  pThe last of which OpenSansBold was the only one that loaded.  I have since tried moving the items around to no effect.  I have even deleted OpenSansBold.ttf from the plist and the project and tried running it.  Clearly then they are not overwriting each other.  All of the files were copied into my bundle copy another common error and still, the only file that registered was OpenSansBold in any of my views.  Ive deleted everything and added it back in... basically done all traditional weird XCode could cause the problem bug testing and it hasnt changed anything.  Anyone have any idea what the issue could bep  pThanks a lotp

Negative 11272 pBefore I start describing my Problem Thank you for taking the time to read thisp  pI am trying to code an basic EventCalendar. The user should be able to create events and update eventparameters. If an existing event is clicked, a jquery Dialog is ment to open and show an editable textfield for each eventparameter. Now so far this works fine. The only problem is that, as soon as any of the parameters is manualy changed and saved, the Textfields do not accept any further modification of there Value. Those should normaly be set to the parametervalue of the clicked event before the dialog opens.p  pI already tried to find an answer to my problem via stackoverflows serch function and google.

Negative 11272 pI am writing an android app where my service needs to send an image to some other apps via a broadcast message or by starting a service  there a multiple apps that might be interested to receive the image. p  pIf I load the image into an Bitmap object and put it as an Extra of an Intent it would actually work. However, I want to see if I can send a ParcelFileDescrptor around instead, and let the client load the Bitmap object on their own from reading the spec, it looks like ParcelFileDescriptor is created just for this purpose  sharing files between processes. Here I am trying to avoid sending large objects via Intent.

Negative 11272 pIve been trying to find a solution to this problem all day long but I have been unable to come up with the solution by myself or find it up online.p  pMy problem is the following I am creating an application in vb.net 2010 I have an Access DataBase connected to the project. This Database has 2 tables one is Representatives and the other one is Demos. Im trying to provide some useful stats about the Representatives like Total Demos, Total Sells Amount CPO, Total Recommendations, Total Demos Given and Total Demos Sold. I have been successful in getting the first 3 to work but fail to get the last 2. The problem with this one is that the data entered in to the field is a simple Yes or No and I dont know how to put in to code that if the value of the cell is Yes then to add plus 1 to the counter and if its No to add plus one to a different counter.p  pHere is the code that I have up to now that works for the first 3 Stats.p  precodeTo calculate the total demos when you change the Representative     Dim row As CutcotestDataSet.DemosRow      Dim intTotalItems As Integer     For Each row In CutcotestDataSet.Demos.Rows         intTotalItems  1     Next     lblTotalItems.Text  intTotalItems.ToString      Declare the variables for the values to be stored and later displayed     Dim intTotalCPO As Integer     Dim intTotalRecs As Integer      to look in Demosdgv and add the corresponding data     For i As Integer  0 To CutcotestDataSet.Tables0.Rows.Count  1         intTotalCPO  CutcotestDataSet.Tables0.Rowsi.ItemCPO         intTotalRecs  CutcotestDataSet.Tables0.Rowsi.ItemRecs     Next     lblTotalCpo.Text  intTotalCPO.ToStringc0     lblTotalRecs.Text  intTotalRecs.ToString codepre  pAlso Im having trouble when the value is null it tells me that it cant add DBNull.

Negative 11272 pI am new stackoverflow and first want to extend my appreciate to all the contributors. This has been a very helpful resource and I have learned a great deal from you. Thank you.p  pI am working with jquery validation and have come upon a problem that really has me tied up in knots. I have reduced the code down to its very basics and still cannot resolve the problem. I am trying to validate an input using a required rule and a remote mockjax call. I have been using the Milk demo from jquery as a guide. The Milk demo works just as it supposed to, however my code does not. Upon entering ANY set of characters in the input box I do not get the input validated either by the required rule or the remote mockjax call. If I place the cursor in the input a second time without changing any of the existing input and press the tab or return key, the value gets validated.p  pMy code is as follows     p  precode    document.readyfunction               .mockjax                      url test.action,             response functionsettings                               this.responseText  true             ,             responseTime 500                  var validator  myForm.validate                      rules                               FacilityID                                       required true,                     remote test.action                              ,             messages                               FacilityID                                       required Enter Facility ID,                     remote jQuery.format0 Facility ID NOT found                              ,              specifying a submitHandler prevents the default submit, good for the demo             submitHandler function                               alertsubmitted             ,              set this class to errorlabels to indicate valid fields             success functionlabel                                set ampnbsp as text for IE                 label.htmlampnbsp.addClasschecked             ,             highlight functionelement, errorClass                               element.parent.next.find.  errorClass.removeClasschecked                             ltscriptgt codepre  p p  precodeltsection idmaingt     ltdiv idmyFormWrapgt         lth2gtStep 2 Enter Facility Datalth2gt         ltform idmyForm autocompleteoff actionnext.phpgt             ltlabel forFacilityIDgtFacility IDltlabelgt             ltinput idFacilityID nameFacilityID typetext value maxlength12 gt             ltlabel classstatus forFacilityIDgtltlabelgt             ltbutton classbutton18 onClickjavascriptStartOvergtStart Overltbuttongt         ltformgt     ltdivgt ltsectiongt codepre  p p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5HJPU relnofollowClick herea to go to JSFiddle and test the code above.p  pIf I remove the rule for the remote call, the required rule works just fine.

Of course this classes are depending on much more than one table but i will simplify things here...p  pAt the moment i construct class A from its tablep  precodeselect  from tblA where ID  id codepre  pIf they are successful, the statement of class A gives me something like thatp  precodeID     Name     BID 1      test   3 codepre  pAfter that i had to construct class B in its constructor. Is there any possibility to only make one statement with a join in constructor of class A and construct class B from there I thought this will increase the performance of my application.

In this scenario, an attempt is made to acquire the already locked lock, and we end up in a deadlock. This situation can be avoided by using a recursive mutex.

Negative 11272 pI have an own button class, which simply derives from android.widget.button. I do not use any xmls I do everything programatically  creating FragmentActivities, placing Views on them, assigning handers and so on . In order to meet some dependencies my inherited button must implement a special interface, that allows later casting in order to be more or less generic, therefore I had to inherit from Button  or better I decided to do so .p  pBut my derived buttons loose some features, which their superclass has.p  pPlease take this pics to see, how my two derived buttons the white rectangles buttons differ from the standard button, where TextButton. My derived buttons are just borderless rectangles, the standard button looks as if there is some kind of lifted 3D Border.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwShy0.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I click on the standard button, I also get this behaviour, which my buttons do not have.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNQsK2.png altenter image description herep  pI suppose, I will have to override some super methods, but I am not sure.

Im sure XAML thinks this is fine, but actually it needs to be about half the size to match spec.p  pI tried several things including adding a border to the grid which truncates the background image, keeping the dimensions but cutting it off on the sides and top and adding margins and paddings in various places.p  pI also played with making this a normal  but everything floats over top of this background image so that is not an option. p  pFinally I should mention this is a Windows 8 Windows Store app using Windows Runtime, so certain features in WPF arent available to me here like ViewPort.p  pQuestion how do you adjust the sizedimensions of a XAML grid background image p  pSidenote I think the solution may lie in a transform...  p  pUpdate per poster request here is what the expected result should be. Even though it appears no float over the background image takes place here, in other places text floats over the background.

Negative 11272 pI am writing an android game from the book Beginning Android Games. The game is called Mr. Nom and its essentially like Snake. I finished writing it, and it worked as expected, however the code from the book only allowed for left and right turns with two buttons a left arrow and a right arrow to accomplish that task. I wanted to edit the code to allow for another two buttons an up arrow and a down arrow that would allow you to turn up or turn down. p  pThe source code download with the book had a set of images that went along with this particular game. One of the images included the left and right arrows, so I simply opened the image in Paint.Net and rotated it 90 degrees so that the arrows were facing up and down instead of left to right. All of these images are stored in the assets folder and I saved the rotated image as buttonsrotate.png. This is the code for drawing the buttons to the screenp  precodeprivate void drawRunningUI      Graphics g  game.getGraphics     g.drawPixmapAssets.buttons, 0, 0, 64, 128, 64, 64     g.drawLine0, 416, 480, 416, Color.BLACK     g.drawPixmapAssets.buttons, 0, 416, 64, 64, 64, 64     g.drawPixmapAssets.buttons, 256, 416, 0, 64, 64, 64     g.drawPixmapAssets.buttonsrotate, 64, 416, 64, 0, 64, 64     g.drawPixmapAssets.buttons, 192, 416, 0, 64, 64, 64  codepre  pWhen I run the app, the loading screen will open but as soon as I touch the screen to start the game it stops responding and closes. It only does this if I include the linep  precode    g.drawPixmapAssets.buttonsrotate, 64, 416, 64, 0, 64, 64 codepre  pOtherwise the game runs fine. Im sure that the image is in the assets, so I have no idea what is causing the problem.

Negative 11272 pThis question is a bit difficult to explain but I will try my best.p  pI have a project where I have to make an UI which gets data from a third party service and does deserialization and some thread management work.p  pNow my project structure is under one solution in visual studiop  pProject A  The UIp  pProject B The API to get data from third party servicep  pProject C The Thread Manager APIp  pNote Project B has an IB interface and C has an IC interface to help dependency injection. projects B and C will be used by other teams in future.  p  pProject A is using both IB and IC interfaces for dependency injection.p  pNow I will state my understanding of IOC  DIP says a highlevel module should not depend on lowlevel module and both highlevel and lowlevel module should depend on an abstraction. If you want to prevent the changes in highlevel module on changing of lowlevel module you need to invert the control so that lowlevel module will not control the interface and creation of objects that the highlevel module needs.p  pAccording to the above definition both the IB and IC interfaces should be defined in project A right If they are in project A then how will other teams use IB and IC interfaces Do I make another separate project for storing the interfacesp

He said, that join just freezes the main method. But for what reason should this be good He also said, that this is totally random and managed by the scheduler, which doesnt make sense for this part in my opinion the scheduler commands the threadstates, this is clear, but not after calling join, at least not for the java application. Or am I false. My point would be, that Thread a and b ran completely to the end, before the mainthread even called the join method.

What I need to do now is take the id for the current STAFF record and see if it is already set in the STAFFMANAGERS relationship table and either update it with the just selected id from the MANAGERS table or create the record if a manager wasnt previously set.  Both staff and manager ids are stored in form variables at this point so can just be inserted into any SQL commands.p  pIve seen various ways I emcouldem do this such as adding multiple lines to a SQLCmd.commandtext although Im not sure on format for this but I have no idea if this is a foolproof solution or prone to problems or if it will even work.p  pWithout stretching too far out of my current experience or giving me an in depth explanation of something more complex how can I best accomplish thisp

Negative 11272   pHello Im having trouble with the authentication system. Ive followed the documentation pretty closely, but I just cant seem to get this to work. The problem seems to be that when I call the authenticate method with my cleaned form data, its not returning anything. Its clearly doing this in the web page it just returns the render request at the bottom every time I submit the form, and I tried authenticating in the same way via the shell and am also returning True for user is None. p  pIm wondering if perhaps the problem is that I havent included the proper middleware My MIDDLEWARECLASSES are as followsp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeMIDDLEWARECLASSES       django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware,     django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware,     django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware,     django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware,     django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware,     django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware,  codepre  pIt appears that I have everything necessary, but Im just not sure. p  pIn any case, heres the code for my viewp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodefrom django.shortcuts import render from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect, HttpResponse from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.contrib.auth.forms import AuthenticationForm from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login    def userloginrequest     if request.method  POST         form  AuthenticationFormrequest.POST         if form.isvalid             username  form.cleaneddata[username]             password  form.cleaneddata[password]             user  authenticateusernameusername, passwordpassword              if user is not None                 if user.isactive                     loginrequest, user                     return HttpResponseGood Job                 else                     return HttpResponseInactive User             else                 return HttpResponseBad Job     else         form  AuthenticationForm     return renderrequest, myapploginform.html,          form form,      codepre  pAnd here is my very simple loginform.html templatep  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodelth1gtLoginlth1gt  ltform actionlogin methodpostgt csrftoken   form.asp  ltinput typesubmit valueSubmit gt ltformgt codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have implemented the following solutionp  pchanged the linep  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeform  AuthenticationFormrequest.POST codepre  ptop  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeform  AuthenticationFormdata  request.POST codepre  pNow I am able to login via the superuser account, but usernamepassword combinations for ordinary accounts are not recognized.

Negative 11272 pI am new to the async world of C and admittedly dont have a lot of knowledge on the subject. I just had to implement it in one of our services and I am a little confused on how it works. I want to POST to an API as fast as absolutely possible.

Great, the process is done and can continue doing other things. The problem is the somewhere in the background the callPostFunction is calling postToAPI and posting to the API, it works, but it takes a long time. It takes about as long although not as long as it did before implementing async. I feel like Im missing something. p  pI have to hit the API as fast. Ideally Id like to hit it as often as the callPostFunction is getting called, nearly immediately. How might I go about doing thatp

Negative 11272 pIve created an addon with the addon sdk. My addon uses the uisidebar module. If a user installs my addon with an older version of Firefox, such as Firefox ESR 24.1.1, the browser will inform the user that the addon has been successfully installed. But, the addon actually produces the following error visible in the browser consolep  precodeError Module sdkuisidebar is not found at resourcegremodulescommonjssdkuisidebar.js resourcegremodulescommonjssdkloadercuddlefish.js 133 codepre  pThis makes sense because I have read that the sidebar module was introduced with version 26. My understanding is that the addon installs despite this because of the Compatible By Default functionality of the browser.p  pHowever, I find this behavior very undesirable for my addon. Without knowing to look at the console, users will have no idea that the installation failed. What is the best practice for informing users about addon incompatibilities Is there a way to enforce the minVersion Should I put a try block around the sidebar require statement and try to throw some sort of alert at the users informing them of the incompatibilityp  pIs there a standard way to address this Any suggestions would be great. Thanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong The minVersion had been set to 21.0 all along.p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSAddonsSDKGuidesFirefoxCompatibility relnofollowThis pagea on the MDN led me to think that the latest version of the SDK corresponded with the current version of Firefox 27 at the time. But, it looks like a new version of the SDK hasnt been released in quite some time. Im on version 1.15 which I downloaded from a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSAddonsSDKTutorialsInstallation relnofollowthis pagea. Since 1.15 was released a while ago, the current version of Firefox at that time was 21.0, and therefore the minVersion was set to 21.0. I failed to check it before posting, so I was under the impression that the addon was being installed on Firefox 24 when the minVersion was 27.p

I want to make the second one perform like the first. So, when minimizing, the elements should nicely wrap under each other and the elements width should increase to 100.p  pIn the second one, it seems the codemedia minwidth 992pxcode is somehow being overridden. When the screen is under 992px the codefloatleftcode and width percentage styles remain the same as if the screen is over code992pxcode.

If we delay it until everything has been done and integrated, then the other team has to modify and change code as well.p  pSo from your experience, what will cost lessp

Negative 11272 pI was trying to convert a DTD file to a yaml file, and Ive tried loading it both in libxml and nokogiri, but it seems that ema DTD file is not a valid XML fileem. Im fine with using any thirdparty gems as long as I can parse the DTD file.p  pMy attempt at conversionp  precodewget httpxml.evernote.compubenml2.dtd irb require nokogiri xml  NokogiriXMLDocument.parseenml2.dtd xml.toyaml gt  rubyobjectNokogiriXMLDocumentndecorators nnodecache []nerrorsn rubyexceptionNokogiriXMLSyntaxErrorn  message n    Start tag expected, lt not foundn  domain 1n  code 4n  level 3n  file n  line 1n  str1 n  str2 n  str3 n  int1 0n  column 1n codepre  pAny online XML validator also returns the same error, i.e Start tag expected. I assume it is because all valid XML docs start with codeltxmlcode, which dtd files seem to be missing. This is what has led me to the conclusion emall DTD files are invalid XML filesem. However, it does feel weird to me that the xml definition syntax itself was not defined as valid XML. Id love to know any reasons behind this.p  pThe reason Im parsing the DTD file is that I want to remove invalid attributes from an XML file. To know which attributes to keep and which to remove, I need a way to parse the DTD file.p  h3Asideh3  pAnd ultimately, this is all just a step in trying to convert HTML to ENML Evernote Markup Language. The steps involved in it includep  ul liConverting HTML to valid XHTMLli liConverting the body to an ennote elementli liRemoving invalid tags and attributes as per the dtd fileli liValidating the enml file against the dtdli ul  pIm currently thinking to just copy the disallowed attributes and tags from a hrefhttpsdev.evernote.comdocarticlesenml.php relnofollowherea and using that to validate my xhtml, but Id prefer to use the dtd as my source.p  h3Updatesh3  pThe nokogiri DTD class is a Node class for holding an inline DTD node, and validating against it. In my case, I have an external DTD file specified using the SYSTEM attribute, which a hrefhttpsgithub.comsparklemotionnokogiriissues440 relnofollownokogiri does not seem to supporta. And even if it did work, all I would get is validation.p  pI did get validation to work properlyp  precodedtd  XMLDtd.new File.read Rails.root.joinlib, assets,enml2.dtd enmldocument  XMLDocument.string enml ret  enmldocument.validate dtd codepre  pI havent tried REXML. Will give that a go and report back.p  pstrongClarification on custom cleanupstrong Im trying to convert an html document to a XML document that validates with the given DTD. Most html elements and attributes are not allowed in the ENML schema, so I have to strip them, or remove them. I also need to know which attributes are allowed and which are not, so that I can parse the XML properly and removesanitize the offending elements and attributes. p  pFor the cleanup purpose, Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comflavorjonesloofah relnofollowLoofaha, but to use it, I need a list of tagattributes which attributes are available for each tag. Instead of making multiple passes validating the doc which I am doing at the end of cleanup, Im just looping through each xml tag, and cleaning them up. But to know emhow to clean themem, I need to know which tags and elements are supported in the valid schema. Thus, I need to parse the DTD file.p  pFrom what I understand, XLST is the right tool for the job, but Im not comfortable enough to use it.p

Negative 11272 pI have run into an issue recently where we have been told to remove the hash symbols from our Backbone applications. This presents two problems a the ASP.NET routes need to handle any remotely linked URL currently this is no problem with the hash symbols so that were not hitting a 404 error and b the proper route needs to be preserved and passed on to the client side Backbone application. Were currently using ASP.NET MVC5 and Web API 2 for our backend. p  pstrongThe setupstrongp  pFor an example and test project, Ive created a test project with Backbone  a simple C ASP.NET MVC5 Web Application.

We can use the Backbone method of coderouter.navigateurl, truecode as well as other methods to use adjust the URL manually. emHoweverem, this does not solve the problem of remote linking. So, when trying to access codehttplocalhostHomeIndextestsamplecode you just end up with the typical 404.0 error served by IIS. so, I assume that it is handled in in the strongRouteConfig.csstrong file  inside, I add a emCatchAllem routep  precoderoutes.MapRoute     name CatchAll,     url clientRoute,    defaults new  controller  Home, action  Index   codepre  pI also uncomment out the pushState and root attributes in the Backbone.history.start methodp  precode        Backbone.history.start             pushState true,             root HomeIndex                  var Route  Backbone.Router.extend             routes                  testid function event                      .row.htmlHello,   event                 ,                 help function                       alerthelp                                                var appRouter  new Route         appRouter.navigatetestsometext,  trigger true          appRouter.navigatehelp,  trigger true  codepre  pThis allows me to at least let get past the 404.0 page when linking to these routes  which is good. However, none of the routes actually trigger when I head to them. After attempting to debug them in Chrome, Firefox, and IE11 I notice that none of the events fire. However, if I manually navigate to them using codeappRouter.navigatehelp,  trigger true code the routes are caught and events fired.p  pIm at a loss at this point as to where I should start troubleshooting next. Ive placed my Javascript inside of the document.ready event as well as the window.onload event also as well as not inside of an event none of these correct the issue.

Negative 11272 pI am trying to use logman on remote machines and have run into a couple of issues.p  pThe first issue is as follows.  I am trying to use logman to tell a remote machine to create a performance counter.  I use logman create  s  u  .  This fails with access denied.  If I run on that remote machine with logman create  u   then it works without issue.  I am guessing there is some network setting I am missing that will allow me to use the logman commands remotely.p  pThe second issue is with the query and start commands.  The u argument for specifying a username and password is not allowed for reasons I do not understand.  If I try using the command logman query  s  then I will get access denied, but I have no way of passing user credentials since attempts at using the u argument gets be the message that Argument u is not allowed with the other arguments specified.p  pI am running the logman commands from Powershell, though I dont think that should make a difference.  If necessary I could use invokecommand to run these calls on the remote machine, but Id rather avoid that if possible especially since logman is supposed to give me the option to run the commands on a remote machine and pass credentials already.  Does anyone know a way of solving these two issuesp

We will say strongDb1strong is the original and strongDB2strong is the second this is not splitting the database either, its already split. p  pI have been given parameters to query the tables by in strongDB1strong and then put that information queried into strongDB2strong and then go back into the tables in strongDB1strong and delete the fields that were just put in strongDB2strong, so to help keep the strongDB1strong clean and quick.  This part I have and works properly, just a basis for anyone reading. p  pstrongProblemstrong p  pWhen I go back into push the information to DB2 a second time or more, just FYI I have everything coded to a button to handle the queries and pushing of the data to the DB2, because the data has been deleted from the tables already the queries return blank tables or tables with different data, and when I push the data again those tables just over ride the table I had already pushed to DB2, basically just deleting the original. I need the information to combine, not delete one another. The information is from the same table so there should not be any issues with fields.p  pI am using the DoCmd.transferdatabase method...I knowhave been told that there is a linking function with in this command but that wont be applicable for this, they dont want anymore links just the data pushed to a second database.p  pMy thought is to to sift through the table in the DB2, find the first null row, and then insert the newly queried data from DB1 starting at that row, but I cannot find a way to have DB1 and DB2 connection open at the same time so that when I search for the null row in DB2 I can tell the information to insert from DB1 into that row and fill in from there.p  pI have no idea if this is actually possible.p  pI have been trying to use  codeDim rs as DAO.recorder, Dim db as DAO.database, Dim rs2 as DAO.recordset, Dim db2 as DAO.databasecode to set the connection to codeDB1CurrentDbcode and then the codeDB2code set to the path way of the DB2, but I dont think two can be opened at the same time. If they can I am clearly doing something wrong because it is not working.p  pAny ideas would be great. Nothing I have tried is working.p

Is possible that the problem has a relationship with different size of data type from 32bit to 64bitp  pI explain you how animation works. I have realized an image with a chronometer with a blue background inside. After i cover the blue image with a white Image. Second by second I remove a slice of white image and show the blue background.p  pIts a very cool animation, when time is less 3 seconds the background change in red and i add also a pulse animation, i like it.p  pThe problem is the animation doesnt start with 64 bit devices and background remain white, no slices of white image are removed.p  pSome ideasp  pHere my codep  precode[sfondoCronometro setImage[UIImage imageNamedcronoStart.png]]  maskLayer  [CAShapeLayer layer]  CGFloat maskHeight  sfondoCronometro.frame.size.height CGFloat maskWidth  sfondoCronometro.frame.size.width  CGPoint centerPoint centerPoint  CGPointMakesfondoCronometro.frame.size.width2, sfondoCronometro.frame.size.height2  Make the radius of our arc large enough to reach into the corners of the image view.

Negative 11272 pId like to ask you how to add an object to list. Lets use following example we have two models  meal and product. I want to create creation form of meal, which has ManyToMany relation to product. So there are few input fields like name, recipe and so on. For me the problem is to add products that meal consists of. Of course I could use here regular multiselectable list, but I assume that there will be a lot of products, so list would be extremely long. Anyone have got an idea how it could be done with input field and adding products object just by typing its name Any other ideas much appreciated as well. p

Negative 11272 pI am trying to debug an issue in our cache cluster on azures compute service. Every worker instance is a cache node and they all open tcp sockets to talk to each other. After a while they lose a member here and there which then reconnects after a while but the problem is when running under load I have 10GB of data in the cluster and a loss of a member triggers a rebalancing which is extremely costly. Ive played with timeouts in my caching layer but nothing seems to help. So my more fundamental question is Does Azure close sockets between worker instances after some time I know it does between clients and the load balancer but i wasnt sure how it treats socket connections between role instances.p  pAny insight would be appreciated. thanksp

Then use this id and name to select medicines from database . medicines is a string containing comma separated values like Aspirin2,Amoxylin5,etc2,etc10 where 10 means 10 of them  indicating quantity . Then the drug name is stored into an arraylist and qty into another . Then use this medicinename to get the medicineid and sellprice. Finally set all this into a table .p

Is that a workable method If yes, how can I create 2 interface with 1 dongle, say, wlan0wlan1 or wlan0.1wlan0.2 or something like thatp  pIs the whole scenario workable just through some operation about interface and system, or the scenario MUST be supported by driver of dongles, if driver doesnt provide this scenario, then it is impossiblep  pI tried it on Ralink Soc beforeits called apclient mode by Ralink. On Ralink platform with its own SDK including Linux source and WiFi drivers, it is done by iwpriv commands. There are interfaces call apcli0 to work in station mode and ra0 work in AP mode, but there is only 1 physical WiFi interface builtin in Ralink Soc. It works just fine but Im not using Ralink Soc now. Is that feature also available for other donglesp

Negative 11272 pThe applications backend is written in Delphi. The other side is a web user interface written in ASP. The two are able to communicate through a SOAP WCF service layer. I am supposed to send a file through this web service. My predecessor managed to send a file from the ASP.NET client, to the Delphi server, by loading the entire file into a Object variable, and sending this object over WCF. As it is sent to the Delphi server, the .NET Object is converted to a Delphi Variant. I can do the same the other way. I load the file into a Delphi Variant, which becomes a .NET Object on the client side. I can then send this file to the browser by casting it to an array of bytes I dare to assume this object is going to be entirely stored in one contiguous area of memoryp  precodeReponse.Writebyte[]theObject codepre  pIt works, but I know I should use a stream for this purpose, so I tried the following instead Delphi code on the server sidep  precodevar    report  TOLScheduleReport  Contains prStream  TMemoryStream    tfs TFileStream    reader TBinaryReader begin    tfs  TFileStream.CreatefileName, fmOpenRead    reader  TBinaryReader.Createtfs    report.prStream  TMemoryStream.Create    report.prStream.CopyFromtfs, tfs.Size     Result  report end codepre  pOn the client side ASP.NET, I would have something like thisp  precodereport  WSReporting.GetScheduleReport Response.ContentType  applicationpdf Response.Writereport.prStream codepre  pSorry if Im being naive, but this doesnt work. The client generates a short HTML file without any binary data. I dont know what else to do with emprStreamem, which is of some emTMemoryStreamem type. This is the name of the Delphi type, and is not very useful on the .NET side.p  pIn addition, I would like the loading of the PDF file to be done asynchronously. I dont want my user interface to be stuck while the client is receiving the file. Id like to show some animated waiting screen that redirects to the PDF file when this PDF file is entirely on the client side.p  pI am surprised how little information about Delphi is available on the net, as compared to .NET. Im tampering with Delphi code for the very first time, so please, be lenient.p

Negative 11272 pIm looking to rebuild a vanilla codeBackbonecode app into a codeBackbone.Marionettecode based one. However, one of the existing views is giving me headache  a collection of different subviews. p  pFor exampe, the server returns a list that contains 100 entries, 50 items of type A, 49 items of type B and one C.

The only thing that I can think of is that scalac doesnt find implicits within a Type that doesnt have a Value Type accessible on any prefix. It cannot be referenced. Scalac apparently needs to access that codeFoo.this.foocode to resolve implicits in it, which it cant in this case.p  pI feel like that if you combine type classes and path dependent types, you are effectively doomed. Youll end up dealing with this kind of stuff. I did that because scalac wouldnt otherwise infer types in my API methods and user would have to declare them explicitly. So I chose this kind of design so that types are constructed in codeFoo[T]code and api methods use the existing type, but I hit several really ugly problems and bugs of this kind that made my app look like an overengineered crap...p

Negative 11272 pDisclaimer I am still obviously inexperienced with Git.  Thank you for your help and patience.p  pOccasionally, after working in a feature branch for some time, Ill want to pull in new changes from master.  Lets say that the feature branch is x commits behind master.  When I update the feature branch, the git tools I use e.g. SourceTree, GitHub when pushed, etc. report that I have just created x new commits on my feature branch.p  pUltimately, the history only shows a single merge commit.  However, odd things happen as a result of these x commits.  For example, when I push the branch, a post is made to our Slack channel generated via GitHub claiming that I have just added y commits where yx[the number of new, nonmergerelated commits present in the feature branch]p  pFor example, I have just merged master into my feature branch, and SourceTree now shows that I have 97 commits ready to be pushed.  Before the merge, SourceTree only showed that I had 2 unpushed commitsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRtYpJ.png altenter image description herep  pIs this normal  Is gitSourceTree effectively just referencing the original commits instead of duplicating the relevant code changes in a brand new commitp  pNone of this is really a big deal, but it is a bit misleading and confusing.

Negative 11272 pSo I am working on a little SVG project with Snap.p  precode Here is my code so far   codepre  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioamiecrutchleypenbNmqjx relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioamiecrutchleypenbNmqjxap  pI am trying to accomplish 2 additional things, and so far I havent been able to figure them out.p  pFirst, as I am new to Snap SVG, I am wanting the inner bars to animate and THEN have the outer circle halves animate in. This is where I mean using something like a delay or timing. p  pSecond, I am wanting each path to be able to be able to animate on its x and y coordinates in addition and the same time to animating the opacity. So my idea is to have the inner bars to start animate when hovered to an opacity of 0 and the top bar to be moved down about 20px and the bottom bar to be moved up 20px. Then once that is done animated, immediately the outer circle halves animate to 0 opacity and at the same time animate outwards away from the center by 30px on each side.p

Negative 11272 pIn C there are two ways one can declare an object. For examplep  precode The first way vectorltintgt nums  new vectorltintgt   The second way vectorltintgt nums codepre  pPeople say that the first declaration allocates the object in the heap and the second on the stack. I can imagine how it works if the vector object is in the heap. The compiler would just find a free block in the heap to store the vector. But what would happen if the object is allocated on the stack as I keep pushing new elements to the vector Will there be enough memory space If not, how would the compiler find a sufficiently big memory block on the stack to store the vector when the size of the vector can changep

Therefore, a HttpURLConnection is a URLConnection and is also an Object.p  pThe reverse is not necessarily true a URLConnection may be a HttpURLConnection, but it isnt necessarily.

We have customers that would like to use a SSO way to connect to our web application and our API.p  pFor example, a user A from our customer ACompany is connected to its intranet. And in this intranet theres a link to our Web App. If this user A clics on it the Web App must redirect it to the IDP of the ACompany. User A then signin and gets an access token and is redirected back to our web app. Then, our web app validate this access token, get the claims and etc ...p  pIf a user B from our customer BCompagny wants to do the same, itll have to be redirected to its own IDP too.p  pHow this can be achieve using IdentityServer3 How my WebApp the RP knows where to redirect the incoming request to be authenticated to IDPA or IDPB or elsewhere ...p  pIs this use case illustrates what is called Identity federationp  pI was looking at OpenID Connect and ThinkTecture IdentityServer V3 that seem to be a very good product but I have some difficulties to see if it will fit my needs.p  pThank you for your helpp  pFredp

Negative 11272 pI am doing a project where I am doing a lot of computations on the circle S1, that is, the interval [0,1 with all operations mod 1. It struck me that the double number representation is quite clunky for this purpose, as it contains quite a lot of redudant information, such as the sign, possibility of exponents larger that 0 etc.p  pMy idea is to instead use unsigned long integers. Since every number in binary in [0,1 is of the form 0.101001... I only need to store the digits after the decimal point. Thus, a long emnem in binary would represent the number 0.emnem.p  pMy question is how to effectivly implement standard operations in this system. Addition and subtraction is simply done as usual mod 264. However, multilication and division seems a bit trickier. And what about elementary functions Perhaps this has already been implementedp  pThankful for answers.p

Negative 11272 pI am trying to read up on best practices on DynamoDB. I saw that DynamoDB has two PK typesp  ol liHash Keyli liHash and Range Keyli ol  pFrom what I read, it appears the latter is like the former but supports sorting and indexing of a finite set of columns.p  pSo my question is why ever use only a hash key without a range key Is it a viable choice only when the table is not searchedp  pItd also be great to have some general guidelines on when to use what key type. Ive read several guides including Amazons own documentation on DynamoDB but none of them appear to directly address this question. p  pThanksp

Ive tried setting any objects created in the Beanshell to null postuse, and checking the Reset bsh.Interpreter before each call.p  pI was able to get around to issue by using the Random function to append a unique id to each image when created in the Save Responses to a file sampler, but results in a lot of files being created. I can verify the saved image file is changing on the filesystem. I can also restart JMeter, or clear the file from the filesystem for it to appear properly, but only the first time. Adding a timestamp via the Save Responses to a file sampler isnt unique enough, but creates additional files anyway.p  pId like to find out why JMeter seems to be caching the images and if theres a way to have a single file written and read each time, avoiding the slew of them Id get by appending a unique ID.

Negative 11272 pSo I have this method this uses a library to generate an external webpage to allow the user to enter their Facebook credentials for verification. Upon entering it we are creating a profile based on the that users account and saving it to a database. Once we save it to the database we are expecting a boolean to represent whether or not the account was unique. We need some way to wait for the database to complete all of its work before continuing execution.p  pIve tried several different methods including doing all the work on a new Thread which wont work since all the UI needs to be on the main thread as well as using codeAutoResetEventcode to wait for the codeauth.Completedcode event to fire. But when using this it will usually block the thread and not even present our external webpage for the user.p  pWhats making this more complicated is trying to deal with all the different events without getting ahead of ourselves. So first we need to wait for codeauth.Completedcode to fire, then from inside that event we need to wait for asynchronous coderequest.GetResponseAsync.ContinueWithltTaskltboolgtgtasync t gt ...code event to finish, and finally wait for the database to complete its task and somehow push the return value all the way back to the calling procedure.p  pAs of right now, this code will perform all the desired functions, but will return false since we arent waiting for any of the events to fire.p  precodepublic bool LoginFacebookbool isLinkedAccount      if IOS          UIKit.UIWindow window  UIKit.UIApplication.SharedApplication.KeyWindow         UIKit.UIViewController viewController  window.RootViewController endif         var auth  new OAuth2Authenticator                               clientId ,                               scope email,                               authorizeUrl new Urihttpsm.facebook.comdialogoauth,                               redirectUrl new Urihttpwww.facebook.comconnectloginsuccess.html                                 if ANDROID         Forms.Context.StartActivityauth.GetUIAndroid.App.Application.Context elif IOS         if viewController  null                      while viewController.PresentedViewController  null                 viewController  viewController.PresentedViewController             viewController.PresentViewControllerauth.GetUI, true, null          endif          If authorization succeeds or is canceled, .Completed will be fired.         auth.AllowCancel  true         auth.Completed  sender, eventArgs gt          if IOS             viewController.DismissViewControllertrue, null endif             if eventArgs.IsAuthenticated                              var request  new OAuth2RequestGET, new Urihttpsgraph.facebook.comme, null, eventArgs.Account                 request.GetResponseAsync.ContinueWithltTaskltboolgtgtasync t gt                                      if t.IsFaulted                         Console.WriteLineError   t.Exception.InnerException.Message                     else                                              try                                                      string content  t.Result.GetResponseText                             Console.WriteLinecontent                             JObject user  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltJObjectgtcontent                             Facebook profile  new Facebook                             profile.uuid  user[id].ToString                             profile.firstname  user[firstname].ToString                             profile.lastname  user[lastname].ToString                             profile.email  user[email].ToString                             profile.url  user[link].ToString                              Get picture                             profile.photo  httpsgraph.facebook.com  profile.uuid  picturetypelarge                              if isLinkedAccount                                                              App.AnimateLoadingLoadingImage, OverlayImage, LoadingMessage                                 return await DatabaseInstance.InsertSocialProfileSocialNetworks.Facebook, profile, true                                                          else                                                              await DatabaseInstance.LinkSocialAccountToProfileApp.UserProfile, profile, SocialNetworks.Facebook                                 return true                                                                               catch Exception e                                                      Console.WriteLinee.ToString                                                                   return false                                                return false      codepre

So the function would look like weisurvt,sc[[i]],shp[i]] for each row[i].  I do not understand how to use apply or adply to do this though Im sure one of these or a combo of both are what is needed.  In the end, I am looking for a data frame that gives a value of weisurv for each time given a set of sc and shp held constant through time.

Negative 11272 pI have a Web app that will run on several Webservers, and needs to maintain credentials for calling a 3rdparty service. The 3rd party account requires that the password be changed every 90 days, and provides an automated process to change the password. So I have the app check at startup, and if its been over 30 days since the password was changed, it will execute the password update process.p  pAs soon as it does this, the password needs to be shared with all the instances of the application.p  pI would love to have a SQL table to store this in, but for various reasons I cant.  So Im thinking to use a network file share and have the app cache the value it reads if the expiration date has not yet passed, or read the file every time if the expiration date has passed.p  pThis raises the question of security. It seems bad to give the regular IIS process readwrite access to a shared file with sensitive information. Should I create a separate Web app with separate app pool identity that only readswrites the shared file, and call that from my main Web app If so, would that identity need to be in Active Directory to access the shared filep  pOr is there a better way to share the password across Web instances with minimal outofsync timep

Negative 11272 pIm currently having a problem that I cannot seem to find an answer for. In my web api 2 project, we use the post request to add a resource to the database. However, during serialization of the JSON to Model, im running into a problem with some of the models properties that are actually abstract. Let me illustratep  pClassesp  precodepublic class Person      public string Name get set     public virtual Address Address get set    public abstract class Address       public int Id get set   public class ConcreteAddressType1  Address      public string Street get set   public class ConcreteAddressType2  Address      public string POBox get set  codepre  pThe ApiController Action looks like thisp  precode[HttpPost] public async TaskltIHttpActionResultgt Post[FromBody]Person person       Validate and save to Database     return person        codepre  pCurrently outofthebox this property Address is always null, which makes sense, since it is abstract an must be either one of the two concrete instances which the serializer cannot decide on its own.  So when deserializing the request body to an instance of Person, I need to somehow check the Addressfield of the passed in JsonXML and depending on that, decide which concrete class it has to be. The fields for the two Addresssuperclasses are different enough that I can decide which concrete class it has to be.p  pSo I have tried making custom model binders, for both the Person and Address, but it doesnt feel good, I just want to know if there is a way to use the regular Web Api ModelBinder for Person which works perfectly, just use a different custom binder for one of its properties.p  pI found something in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20408771jsonnetabstractderivedclassdeserializationwithwebapi2JSON.NET Abstract  Derived Class Deserialization with WebAPI 2a, however, I need a solution without the client type parameter. I also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17277578webapimodelbindingandpolymorphicinheritenceWeb Api Model Binding and Polymorphic Inheritencea which looks really close to how I see it, but this is for the entire class in the parameter, not one of its properties.p  pLastly, I found I can do something like this with a custom model binderp  precode[HttpPost] public async TaskltIHttpActionResultgt Post[FromBody]Person person, [ModelBindertypeofAdresModelBinder]Address address      The custom modelbinder has bound address to the correct concrete class     person.Address  address       Validate and save to Database     return person        codepre  pBut Id like to just have the one input parameter and the entire Person object for readability reasons and separate binding and combining seems errorprone and not in the Controlleractionss scope.p  pThanksp

My setup looks like the following.p  precode routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do   post accountsupdatepassword, to accountsupdatepassword   get accounts, to accountsindex end   controllersaccountscontroller.rb class AccountsController lt ApplicationController   def index      always gets here   end   def updatepassword      never gets here   end end   viewsaccountsindex.html.erb ... formforcustomer, url gt action gt updatepassword, html gt  method gt post, role gt form  do f gt ... lt end gt ... codepre  pThe HTML renders with the following form header, which looks correct to me.p  precodeltform roleform classeditcustomer ideditcustomer1 actionaccountsupdatepassword acceptcharsetUTF8 methodpostgtltinput nameutf8 typehidden valueampx2713 gtltinput typehidden nameauthenticitytoken valueXXX gt codepre  pBut the server log shows the following request.p  precodeGET accountsutf8E29C93ampauthenticitytokenXXXampcustomer5Bcurrentpassword5D11111111ampcustomer5Bpassword5D11111111ampcustomer5Bpasswordconfirmation5D11111111ampcommitReset HTTP1.1 codepre  pSo it appears that somehow this POST to accountsupdatepassword is being rewritten as a GET from accounts.  My only guess is that there is some Devise magic that is causing the rewrite, but I cannot figure how to go about debugging it.p  pBelow is the entire server log for account page, and then password

Negative 11272 pI have written a python code codesum.pycode on summing up all numbers for each csv file in a directory codedatacode. Now I am going to use ApacheSpark on Amazon Web Service AWS, to parallelize the summation process for each csv file. I have already done the following stepsp  ol liIve created one master and two slave nodes on AWS.li liI used the bash command code scp r i mykeypair.pem mydir roothostnamecode to upload directory codemydircode onto the AWS cluster master node. The folder codemydircode contains two subdirectories codecodecode and codedatacode, in which, codecodecode contains the python code codesum.pycode, and codedatacode contains all csv files.li liIve login my AWS master node, and from there used the bash command code .sparkcopydir mydircodecode to send my code directory codecodecode that contains codesum.pycode to all slave nodes.li liOn AWS master node, Ive also put the directory codedatacode containing all csv files into the HDFS using code .ephemeralhdfsbinhadoop fs put rootmydirdatacode.li ol  pNow when I submit my application on AWS master node code .sparksubmit mydircodesum.pycode, it shows up an error that the worker node cannot find the csv files. However, after I send my data directory codedatacode to all slave nodes using command codecopydircode, everything works perfectly. p  pSo I get very confused about this problem. As far as I know, the driver program on master node loads the csv files, creates the RDD and sends separate tasks as well as the RDD to each of the slave nodes. That means the slave nodes dont need to know the original csv files, as they just receive the RDD from the master node. If this true, why should I send all my csv files to each of the slave node Also, if I send all my csv files to the slave nodes, much external disk storage on slave nodes is gonna be used. Does it mean ApacheSpark is a very costly tool for parallel computing I really appreciate it if anyone helps me on these two questions.p

Negative 11272 pHello everyone and thanks for your patience, Im in the process of migrating projects from Eclipse to Android Studio.p  pI have a project where a few of its classes are loaded in runtime with reflection. Those classes sometimes use a library that is located in the main process where the reflected class is being loaded, because it needs its particular version of the class. It is more or less a plugin architecture.p  pIn Eclipse this is fairly easy to achieve. I just have to remove the android library in the plugin project, add it to the build path and uncheck the exported project, all from the project settings.p  pHow can I do this with Gradle The only way I know of adding library projects is this one, but this one is the regular one and exports the classes. I just want them to be there at build time.p  precodedependencies  compile projectsomeLibrary  codepre
Negative 11272 pWhen I send multiple pushes to a device, the notifications in the notification tray get grouped at least thats what happens on my Android device. When I then remotely dismiss one of the pushes through the API because its no longer relevant, the grouped notification doesnt update to reflect this, nor does it indeed disappear when all the pushes have been dismissed. It works if theres only a single notification in the devices tray, just not when multiple notifications are grouped. Is there any way to prevent the notifications from grouping Or is there something that Im doing wrong that prevents the grouped notification from updating Im using the V2 API and sending  dismissing link pushes as per the manual.p  pEDIT Im using an user access token because Ive read in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29986166howcanigrouppushbulletnotificationsrq1this SO questiona that using an OAuth client would group the notifications which is the opposite of what Im trying to achieve. Using an OAuth client actually behaved quite weird for me only the first push would result in a notification, subsequent pushes would still be visible in the app but would neither create notifications of their own nor update the existing notification only when I dismissed the first notification remotely would another notification pop out to take its place. But though making it work with an OAuth client would be even more preferable for my use I could just as easily continue to use an user access token if it helps.p  pEDIT 2 Experimenting further I found that if I push to a user using their own access token it works perfectly I was able to push more than ten notifications to my own phone using my access token and they all appeared separately and I was able to dismiss them through the API. When I used a different users access token the pushes started grouping as soon as the second one was received and there was no removing them anymore neither updating the push with dismissed true nor sending a DELETE request to the push would make it go away. So I guess Ill have to ask the users to provide their access tokens to the app its okay, its just a couple of admins from the office next doors, so its not random users sharing their access tokens with a stranger.p

Negative 11272 pI am currently studying to support 4K3840x2160 on H.264 Encoder. When I studied the specs of H.264, it says 4K resolution is supported in Level5.2XAVC. In order to check the implementation I encoded my full HD1920x1080bitstream using x264 in FFMPEG for three different levelsLevel4,4.1 and 5.2. p  pHere is what I noticed  All the three Encoded bitstreams, encoded for different levels matched pixel by pixel.  I was wondering if the encoding is done for different levelsLevel4,4.1 and 5.2, how come there is no change in bitstream.p  ul lipI have a solution of high 422 Level4.1, are there any changes in the core modules like Transformation, Quantazition, CAVLC to support 4K3840 x 2160XAVC.pli lipor the processing of all Level5.2 is same as Level4.1.pli ul  pIt would be very helpful, if somebody can refer me to any documents which explains the diffrence in processing of H.264AVC and XAVCp

The URL of the users profile is something likep  precodewww.website.comuseruseridhere codepre  pThis user ID is taken straight from the codeUsercode tables primary key.p  pIs it safe to have the codeuseridcode in a URL I want to prevent against potential vulnerabilities.

So if I enter rusty123, it should compare rusty to rusty123 and save the result as a integer 3  because the password is off by 3 characters i.e. 123 is wrong. I then convert this integer to a string and record it to the file newFile.p  pI think something that takes password rusty as a constant, and then reads every line of a new password input, and compares it so rusty will do the trick, but I just dont know how.p  precodepassword  rusty  userinput  rawinputPlease enter the password codepre  pso the user inputs Rusty and the function reads that the password is wrong by 1 character, namely R  should have been lower casep  pSOLVED If you have the same problem, follow the link that Chris Beck provides at the end of his explanation.

Negative 11272 pIm using JGraphT to create a graph and I want to be able to visualise and manipulate it. There are some examples that show how to visualise the graph, but it seems that it involves quite a lot of manual code to layout the vertices, etc. I was wondering if there was any graph layout algorithm that could automate this process already in JGraph with a small example. Mostly the graphs Im drawing are Directed Acyclic Graphs. I have already drawn the graphs by exporting them to .dot format and display it using a hrefhttplinux.die.netman1dot relnofollowdota, but I need a little interaction now.p

Because codeGetResponseStreamcode always  sometimes returns the same instance. So when I get the response stream and then dispose it, then maybe rethrow the exception to another layer that also gets the response stream it will be already disposed and unreadable and throw more exceptions because of that.p
