Positive 100064 pI am using Ionic Framework to develop mobile application. Instead of packing the views with the build, i am wondering is it possible to retrieve the views from the server and push it to templateCache manually based on the options user choose. This helps me to control and change the views and publish to my server which gets downloaded by the app. This also  helps me to avoid publishing the application to the store again and again when there are some changes in the views.  My big doubt is   whether androidIOS store will reject the build if i publish with this kind of dynamic views.p

Positive 100064 pSo a little bit of a background, I have this project and am working on Version 2 which involves adding in offline functionality. I am stuck to the following stack as changing it now would involve to much overheadp  pLaravel API MYSQL Ionicp  pI have heard a lot about syncing using PouchCouchDB but unfortunately I cant change everything to use this stack. p  pI decided in my limited AngularJSJS knowledge to use a HTTP Interceptor to intercept all requests, check if it is a POSTPUT request, check if the device is onoffline and either save the data in local storage or carry on with the request. This is where the issues begin. p  pHere is my APIInterceptorp  precodeApp.factoryAPIInterceptor, function q       return          request function config               ifconfig.method  POST  config.method  PUT                              Add data to localstorage                  Exit without actually sending the request to the server.                 return q.reject                           return config  q.whenconfig                codepre  pAs you can see I am returning code.rejectcode but what I need is mimic the API response and pass back to my service as if the request was processed successfully so my app can carry on as normal.

Positive 100064 pI am trying to implement native page transition into my Ionic project after reading great tutorial from a hrefhttpwww.gajotres.nethandlingnativeviewanimationswithionicframework relnofollowhttpwww.gajotres.nethandlingnativeviewanimationswithionicframeworka.p  pHowever, I found the problem that sometimes the page is changed after the page transition is made. Meaning, it will animate transition from page A to page A. Only then, page A become page B. The solution provided by the article and also the plugin is by estimate setting the delay before the animation begin. But this way of doing isnt very reliable.p  pSo, I am thinking instead of using delay, but apply the animation on entering that page with thisp  precodescope.onionicView.enter, function event, viewData      window.plugins.nativepagetransitions.slide             direction left           codepre  pIt works great when navigate from other page to this page. But it will be animation problem when navigate BACK from other page to this page.p  pHow can I know user is BACK to this page so that I can perform different direction of animationp

Positive 100064 pI am building up an mobile application using Ionic Framework and Cordova Sqlite. I am displaying the data from the sqlite database in an ionic list.

Positive 100064 pIm developing a mobile phone application. Sign up  Sign in mechanism should be implemented without entering any usernamepassword pair and will be based on 2F authentification via the SMS confirmation code.p  pCommon way of an implementation this functionality is pretty easy. The user enters the phone number during registration, the server sends him the one time confirmation code. Then the user sends received code and the server verifies it. If everything is ok, the phone receives access token, saves it in a phone memoryDBlocal storage and uses this token per each HTTP request to API.p  pIts not a problem to implement such way of authentification, but I wondered about the additional security.p  pstrongWhat can be additionally sended with confirmation code from the mobile phonestrong Maybe phone MAC address certainly if its possible, randomly generated string like a hash or any other unique identifier.

Negative 100064 pI am rewriting the core NIO server networking code for my project, and Im trying to figure out when I should store connection information for future use.  For example, once a client connects in the usual manner, I store and associate the SocketChannel object for that connected client so that I can write data to that client at any time.  Generally I use the clients IP address including port as the key in a HashMap that maps to the SocketChannel object.  That way, I can easily do a lookup on their IP address and asynchronously send data to them via that SocketChannel.p  pThis might not be the best approach, but it works, and the project is too large to change its fundamental networking code, though I would consider suggestions.  My main question, however, is thisp  pAt what point should I store the SocketChannel for future use  I have been storing a reference to the SocketChannel once the connection is accepted via OPACCEPT.  I feel that this is an efficient approach, because I can assume that the map entry already exists when the OPREAD event comes in.  Otherwise, I would need to do a computationally expensive check on the HashMap every time OPREAD occurs, and it is obvious that MANY more of those will occur for a client than OPACCEPT.  My fear, I guess, is that there may be some connections that become accepted OPACCEPT but never send any data OPREAD.  Perhaps this is possible due to a firewall issue or a malfunctioning client or network adaptor.  I think this could lead to zombie connections that are not active but also never receive a close message.p  pPart of my reason for rewriting my network code is that on rare occasions, I get a client connection that has gotten into a strange state.  Im thinking the way Ive handled OPACCEPT versus OPREAD, including the information I use to assume a connection is valid and can be stored, could be wrong.p  pIm sorry my question isnt more specific, Im just looking for the best, most efficient way to determine if a SocketChannel is truly valid so I can store a reference to it.

Negative 100064 pI have been developing an Android app and testing with a 1.5 AVD and the manifest setting of p  precodeltusessdk androidminSdkVersion3 gt codepre  pMy goal is to make this app available to all phones running 1.5 and greater. I had thought that as long as I develop to 1.5 then that was basically all I had to worry about and any phone running 1.5 or higher would see my app in the market and be able to install it. The following documentation however has me concerned that the app may not in fact be visible to all phones in the market unless I go through the following steps to manage various screen sizes and densities.p  pMy layout is very basic and I do not manage any alternate layouts for high resolution, I just let android manage the scaling. Do I need to follow these guidelines in order to have my app visible to all phones 1.5 and higher Or is this only necessary in certain circumstancesp  pFrom a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.htmlap  precodeStrategies for Legacy Applications  If you have already developed and published an Android application based on Android 1.5 or earlier platform version, you need to consider how you will adapt your application so that it is deployable to   Existing devices, which may be running Android 1.5 or lower platform version, as well as to  Newer devices that are running Android 1.6 or higher and offering various screen sizes and resolutions  To support the newer devices and the different screens they use, you might need to make some changes in your app, but at the same time your app may be very stable and so you want to minimize the changes. There are a variety of ways that you can extend your existing application to support new devices with multiple screens and existing devices running older platform versions. You should be able to make these changes to your application such that you can distribute a single .apk to any and all devices.  The recommended strategy is to develop against the most recent version of the platform you are targeting, and test on the minimum one you want to run on. Heres how to do that     1. Maintain compatibility with existing devices by leaving your applications androidminSdkVersion attribute as it is. You do not need to increment the value of the attribute to support new devices and multiple screens.    2. Extend compatibility for Android 1.6 and higher devices by adding a new attribute  androidtargetSdkVersion  to the usessdk element. Set the value of the attribute to 4. This allows your application to inherit the platforms multiple screens support, even though it is technically using an earlier version of the API.    3. Add an empty ltsupportsscreensgt element as a child of ltmanifestgt. If you need to enable size or density attributes later, this is where you will add them.    4. Change your applications build properties, such that it compiles against the Android 1.6 API Level 4 library, rather than against the Android 1.5 or earlier library. You will not be able to compile your application against the older platform because of the new manifest attribute.    5. Set up AVDs for testing your application on Android 1.6 and higher releases. Create AVDs that use the screen sizes and densities that you want to support. When you create the AVDs, make sure to select the Android 1.6 or higher platform as the system image to run. For more information, see How to Test Your Application on Multiple Screens, below.    6. Set up AVDs for testing your application on Android 1.5 or earlier platform. You need AVDs running the older platforms you are targeting, so that you can test for compatibility and ensure that there are no functional regressions.    7. Compile your application against the Android 1.6 library and run it on the AVDs you created. Observe the way your application looks and runs, and test all of the user interactions.    8. Debug any display or functional issues. For issues that you resolve in your application code, make certain not to use any APIs introduced in API Level 4 or later. If you are in doubt, refer to SDK reference documentation and look for the API Level specifier for the API you want to use. Using an API introduced in API Level 4 or later will mean that your application will no longer be compatible with devices running Android 1.5 or earlier.    9. For resourcerelated issues, you can try resolving them by        Adding a anyDensityfalse attribute to ltsupportsscreensgt, to enable densitycompatibility scaling.        Creating any size or densityspecific resources you need and placing them in directories tagged with the correct qualifiers. Qualifiers must be arranged in a proscribed order. See Alternative Resources for more information.        Note that if you add size or densityspecific resource directories tagged with any of the resource qualifiers listed in this document, you should make sure to also tag those directories with the vltapilevelgt qualifier for example, v4. This ensures that those resources will be ignored when the application is run on Android 1.5 or lower platform versions.   10. If your application does not offer support such as custom layouts for large screens and you want the platform to display your application in screencompatibility mode on larger screens, add a largeScreensfalse attribute to the ltsupportsscreensgt element in the manifest. See ScreenCompatibility Examples for illustrations of how the platform displays your application in this case.   11. If your application does not offer support such as custom layouts for small screens such as on a QVGA lowdensity screen and you do not want Android Market to offer the application to users of smallscreen devices, you must add a smallScreensfalse attribute to the ltsupportsscreensgt element.   12. Continue testing and debugging until your application performs as expected on all of the platforms and screen sizes your application will support.   13.

Negative 100064 pMaybe this is a silly question, but I cannot seem to find an obvious answer.p  pI need a concurrent FIFO queue that contains only unique values. Attempting to add a value that already exists in the queue simply ignores that value. Which, if not for the thread safety would be trivial. Is there a data structure in Java or maybe a code snipit on the interwebs that exhibits this behaviorp
Negative 100064 pMy Googlefu is weak and so I turn to the hive mind...p  pI have a Selenium script I originally developed in the IDE, which I am now trying to adapt to run on IE8 via SeleniumRC. Im trying to debug an error where an element is not being found. p  pThe problem is that as soon as the error occurs, the script exits and RC closes the browser. This makes it a bit hard to poke around with Firebug, etc, to see what is going on under the covers.p  pIn the IDE, I could simply set a breakpoint. Is there a way to freeze the state of RC and the browser when an error occursp  pAny other ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 100064 pLooking for a little help getting started on a little project ive had in the back of my mind for a while.p  pI have log files varying in size depending on how often they are cleaned from 50500MB. Id like to write a program that will monitor the log file while its actively being written to.  when in use its being changed pretty quickly easily several hundred lines a second or so.  Most if not all of the examples ive seen for reading logtext files are simply open and read file contents into a variable which isnt really feasible to do every time the file changes in this situation.   Ive not settled on a language to write this in but its on a windows box and I can work in .net flavors  java  or php  heh dont think php will fly to well for this, and can likely muddle through another language if someone has a suggestion for something well built for handling this.p  pEssentially I believe what Im looking for would probably be better described to as a high speed way of monitoring a text file for changes and seeing what those changes are.  Each line written is relatively small. less than 300 characters, so its not big data on each line.p  pEDIT to change the wording to hopefully better describe what im trying to do.  Which is write a program to keep an eye on a log file for a trigger then match a following action to that trigger.  So my question here is pertaining to file handling inside a programming language.p  pI greatly appreciate any thoughtscomments.p

Negative 100064 pI have a ruby script that performs a lot of memory intensive work. The script sometimes fails to complete because of unavailability of memory. Fortunately, there is a way I can split the script into two as there are literally 2 parts to the ruby script. The memory intensive work also gets split into 2 as I split the script into 2 separate scripts. But now I want script 2 to execute after script 1. I intend to write a shell script which looks something likep  precoderuby script1.rb ruby script2.rb codepre  pWhat Im concerned about in this approach is that since both scripts are scheduled in the same shell script, it would do no good to memory disintegration that we are trying to achieve by splitting the ruby script into 2.p  pWill both script1.rb and script2.rb run in their own memory space if they run as one shell script And if script1.rb is terminated, would it free up memory that script2.rb might utilize Does splitting the scripts into two and running them through a shell script sound like an approach for the memory problemp

Negative 100064 pAs I understand it, IShellItemImageFactory.GetImage should return a thumbnail ie, a preview of the actual file contents for common file types images, MS office, PDF and a file type icon for file types that dont have registered preview handler.  p  pHowever, when I use it, the only file types that seem to actually generate thumbnail previews are images jpg, png, etc.  Other types xls, doc, pdf just return the icon.p  pIs this the expected behavior  Or am I misreading how it is supposed to work  In explorer on this system, I am able to preview the contents for MS Office files, which I assume uses the same underlying mechanism.p  pIs there a better way to capture a previewthumbnail for common file typesp

Negative 100064 pLooking for some opinions on this and trying to start pushing forward with a solid design to my next project.  Imagine 5,000,000 individual pictures with accompanying lores preview images each set of pictures belongs to a gallery, which belongs to a person.  There are X number of people.  A specialized version of Flickr, so to speak.p  pThese are housed on a remote host with a web interface for viewing these pictures.  There is also a desktop application to go along with it where you can upload pictures automatically to this remote host and enter the gallery details.  The desktop app has preview images and information about each gallery and person.  A desktop app that syncs with Flickr, so to speak.p  pI need to decide on two things backend storage for the remote host and local storage for the desktop app.  This is targeted for a Windows environment, so I was thinking that SQL Server Express would be a nice fit, but this project has grown quite a bit and that may only work for the desktop end.p  pThe remote web server can be Windows or Linux, PHP or .Net  I dont care as long as the technology fits.  The question is how best to store all that data on the web server so that it can be easily indexed, quickly accessed, and, most importantly, easily backed up and restored in the event of a disaster.  I am not worried about server configuration or disk space at this time, as long as the database solution supports something of a cloud computing scenario.p  pIm thinking a NoSQL backend makes the most sense, storing the photos, galleries, and users as articles rather than rows.  NoSQL seems more capable of growing with a cloud. On the flipside, Flickr has been advertised as using MySQL ...p  pPerhaps this is a more existential question that a real coding question, but I know of no better group to askp

Would this be tough to create  Perhaps there are already some services out there that would authenticate my users and allow them to email large filesThe cost maybe worth it.p  pWould some sort of FTP Solution also be an available option  I would have to know which user is uploading files.

Negative 100064 pIm writing a set of unit tests for a large, complex class called ImageEditor from a piece of legacy code, where image processing and GUI functionality isnt strictly divided. One of the methods in the class, BaseImageChanged, seems to be concerned entirely with how images get displayed and should be disabled in my unit tests to avoid unnecessary complexity. The test project is in C, and the original code is in VB my idea was to create a Decorator for the class in C and then hide the method behind an empty one that does nothing. However, when I try running the unit test, the VB code keeps referencing the old BaseImageChanged method as though the replacement didnt exist.

Negative 100064 pOver the last few months I have been developing an application using Entity Framework code first and sql server CE for the first time. I have found the combination of the 2 very useful, and compared to my old way of doing things particularly ADO.NET it allows for insanely faster dev times.p  pHowever, this morning me and some colleagues came across a problem which we have never seen in any documentation regarding SqlServer CE. It cannot handle more than one insert at oncep  pI was of the opinion that CE may become my database of choice until I came across this problem. The reason I discovered this was in my application I needed to make multiple requests to a web service at once, and it was introducing a bit of a bottleneck so I proceeded to use a codeParallel.Invokecode call to make the multiple requests.p  pThis was all working fine untill I turned on my applications message logging service. At this point I began to get the following error when making the web requestsp  precodeA duplicate value cannot be inserted into a unique index. [ Table name  Accounts,Constraint name  PKAccounts0000000000000016 ] Description An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code.  Exception Details System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeException A duplicate value cannot be inserted into a unique index. [ Table name  Accounts,Constraint name  PKAccounts0000000000000016 ] codepre  pStrange I thought. And my first recation was that it must be something to do with the codeDbContextcode, maybe the codeDbContextcode I was using was static or something else in my codeRepositorycode class was static and causing the problem, but after sniffing around I was certaing it was nothing to do with my code.p  pI then brought it to the attention of my colleagues and after a while it was decided it must be SqlServer CE, and after us all setting up different test projects attempting to recreate the problem using threads it was recreated almost every time, and when using Sql Server Express the problem wasnt ocurring.p  pI just think it is a bit strange that CE cannot handle something as simple as this. I mean the problem is not only with threading  are you telling me that it cannot be used for a web application where two users may insert into a table at the same time...INSANITYp  pAnyway, just wondering if anyone else has come across this late into a project like me and been shocked and annoyed that it works this way Also if anyone could shed light on why it is limited in this way that would be cool.p

Negative 100064 pI know that Python does not support method overloading, but Ive run into a problem that I cant seem to solve in a nice Pythonic way.p  pI am making a game where a character needs to shoot a variety of bullets, but how do I write different functions for creating these bullets For example suppose I have a function that creates a bullet travelling from point A to B with a given speed. I would write a function like thisp  precode    def addbulletsprite, start, headto, speed         ... Code ... codepre  pBut I want to write other functions for creating bullets likep  precode    def addbulletsprite, start, direction, speed     def addbulletsprite, start, headto, spead, acceleration     def addbulletsprite, script  For bullets that are controlled by a script     def addbulletsprite, curve, speed  for bullets with curved paths     ... And so on ... codepre  pAnd so on with many variations. Is there a better way to do it without using so many keyword arguments cause its getting kinda ugly fast. Renaming each function is pretty bad too because you get either codeaddbullet1code, codeaddbullet2code, or codeaddbulletwithreallylongnamecode.p  pTo address some answersp  ol lipNo I cant create a Bullet class hierarchy because thats too slow. The actual code for managing bullets is in C and my functions are wrappers around C API.pli lipI know about the keyword arguments but checking for all sorts of combinations of parameters is getting annoying, but default arguments help allot like codeacceleration0codepli ol

Negative 100064 pIm working on my first SharePoint project doing some UX support.  My clients page uses some custom css including a horizontal mainmenu with dropdown submenus.  When the page is loaded in IE9, none of the submenus work correctly.  The dropdowns appear when you hover over the toplevel item but when you drop your cursor down to the submenu, the hover doesnt register and the menu disappears.p  pThese links work fine in latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, so Im pretty sure this is an IE quirk.  In IE9, if I open the developer tools and toggle the document mode from IE9 to IE7 and then back to IE9, the menus work correctly for the remainder of the browser tabs lifetime e.g. when I use the submenus to navigate to other pages, the dropdowns continue to function properly.  Unfortunately, since this is SharePoint, I dont have a lot of control over the structure of the html here.p  pAnyone know what might be going on  Does anyone know the impact of toggling the browser modes to IE7 and back and why that might fix the problem  Thanksp

Negative 100064 pHeres the situation we have a build server, which services requests over a socket and exposes no UI to the machine it is running on. Based on the requests it receives, it launches build scripts which are typically MS batch files and serves the files these produce. For diagnostic purposes, the build scripts are launched with stdout and stderr redirected to a pipe, and this output is saved into a buffer by the build server application and passed back to the client requesting the build. That way, if the build fails, the person who requested the build can see what the error message was.p  pDuring debug, this build server was built as a console application, mainly for the convenience of being able to print diagnostic messages client connected, request made, etc. Once everything was working just right, I rebuilt it as a nonconsole app.p  pSuddenly, the behavior of the application changed. The output captured by the pipe was reduced to only the output directly generated by the batch file i.e. commands echoed, in this case, since echo wasnt off. The subprocesses launched by the batch files such as MSBuild, nmake, and others opened up console windows and directed their output to the windows instead of to the pipe.p  pI suspect whats happening is that when the application was a console app, the console application didnt attempt to manage its own inputoutput and instead inherited from the running console, resulting in the codedup2code on the IO fds staying live. Thus everything worked fine. But in the situation where the parent build server didnt create a console window, the subprocesses spawned by the batch file felt the need to create their own and handle their own IO, robbing the build server of the captured output not to mention being extremely annoying to anyone connected to the servers desktop.p  pSo basically the question is simple how can a nonconsole launch applications and prevent this behavior I know its possible in principle for most console apps because Emacs shellmode is an example of a nonconsole application capturing and redirecting command output on Windows, but I have no idea how to do it.p  pCurrently I am using Win32s POSIXflavored CRT functions codepipecode, codedupcode, codedup2code, codeclosecode, codespawnvpcode, and codereadcode. Im aware that these are thin wrappers around the real win32 functions but being a UNIX guy by training I figured Id save myself the trouble of wading through codeCreateProcesscode and friends.p  pDevelopment language needs to be C, because the build server is actually written in Haskell and linking C is simpler. For any of you Haskellers out there  I rolled my own spawnredirect code and linked with the FFI instead of using System.Process because I crucially need both codestdoutcode and codestderrcode redirected, and on Windows this is nontrivial to do in pure Haskell.p  pOf course I can use the build server as a console app and just minimize it on the server, no big deal, it works great if I do that. But Id rather not ... any ideasp  pEDIT Thought I might mention that I dont do anything with stdin. Should I be creating a stdin fd, maybe These scripts arent interactive.p

Negative 100064 pIve been thinking about objectoriented principals  practices  paradigms such as SOLID, Law of Demeter, and DDD a lot lately and a theme that continues to surface is enforcing object cardinality.p  pObject association cardinality is derived from business rules that mandate certain entities can only be associated with a certain number of other entity objects. For example, if youre designing a system to manage warehouses, a business rule could be that a single item can only be stored in one warehouse. Obviously, enforcing these rules within the software design is a matter of implementation.p  pWhat Im wondering is this in the event that a rigid cardinality model is required by the business domain, what is the best way to enforce it The techniques I can think of off hand include the followingp  ul lipstrongBidirectional referencesstrong  Bidirectional associations between associated objects object A references object B and object B references object Ap  precodeclass Warehouse    private ListltItemgt items    public void RegisterItemItem obj      ifobj.Warehouse  null       throw new ArgumentExceptionCan only register unowned item      items.Addobj     obj.Warehouse  this     codepreli lipstrongEncapsulate the owned entitystrong  let the owner control its creation and deletion and provide access through a set of APIs that abstract the actual entity implementation object A clones a passed in entity B or creates an entity B based on a passed schematicp  precodeclass Warehouse    private ListltItemgt items    public void RegisterItemItem obj      items.AddItemobj.Clone       public void RegisterItemItemDescriptor item      items.Addnew Itemitem     codepreli lipstrongThird party monitorstrong  Have some third party that understands cardinality constraints create and hookup object associations appropriately object C knows about the relationship between A and B and is responsible for creating and maintaining it  this method is only available to C and not available to clientsp  precodeclass Warehouse    private ListltItemgt items    internal void RegisterItemItem obj      items.Addobj                class WarehouseItemRegistrationService     private ListltItemgt registeredItems    public void RegisterItemWarehouse warehouse, Item item      ifregisteredItems.Containsitem       throw new ArgumentExceptionCan only register unowned items      warehouse.RegisterItemitem     codepreli ul  pI think each technique has its strengths and weaknesses. emBidirectional associationsem can add complexity to the object graph and require private APIs for updating references yet it is very simple to implement and embeds the business constraints in the business entity classes. emEncapsulating the owned entityem can complicate the domain model by forcing entities to have a value based description, yet it is very clean. emThe third party monitorem technique isolates explicit cardinality enforcements to a separate class, but it also complicates the domain model.p  pDoes anyone have any other thoughts, ideas, or better approachesp

There is a thread that will add new pairs into this dictionary  at the moment of writing the application Im not able to have a full list of available keys. An uptodate list of all this pairs have to be shown in the Table View.

In this proof of concept application button click adds a new pair addRandomPair action.p  pI had a similar problem with a NSMutableArray and Array Controller, but there I was able to solve the problem by adding following pair of methods to the class holding an array ivar named data in this classp  precode voidinsertObjectNSString object inDataAtIndexNSUIntegerindex  voidremoveObjectFromDataAtIndexNSUIntegerindex codepre  pstrongIs it possible to add some other methods to the class holding a dictionary AppController to be notified about new insertions Or maybe there is a better solution for my problemstrongp  h2Updateh2  pIve found out that implementing following set of accessors makes Dictionary Controller notified about new itemp  precode voidaddDictionaryObjectNSString object  voidremoveDictionaryObjectNSString object codepre  pstrongThe problem is that codeaddDictionaryObjectcode has only one argument, dictionary would require something like codeaddDictionaryObjectforKeycode.

For example, client can start with the following urlp  precodehttpipportserveridresource codepre  pand next time he should use something likep  precodehttpipportserveridresource1234 codepre  pwhere 1234 is some pointer to the server to know which result the client has already recieved.

Negative 100064 pI know there has been a few questions around this topic, but here is my situation at the moment.p  pI am building a public facing multimedia app that includes chat. There are no issues whatsoever wrt the multimedia components of this app, the only issue I am facing now is that seeing that the smack api is not really suitable for mobile apps, i am now struggling to find a suitable api that will be able to be used crosplatform i.e. Symbian, J2ME, Android, Blackberry,iOS etc. Is there such an api If anybody knows please let me know.p  pThere are apis like the Android asmack that I have come across in my search, other alternatives were to get the smack api source and alter it to my needs. But so far I see my best bet is to write a xmpp proxy component on my server side using java together with netty that will receive connections from multiple clients and pass on the work to worker threads that implement the smack api and represent the client to the xmpp server and send responses back to the client. The proxy will use either Sockets or Http to receive connections from clients.p  pAny thoughts around what I am planning  p  pThanks in advance.p

Sometimes I can have as many as 500 books.p  pIve added shadow to the codeUIImageViewcode with code that is thisp  precodeUIImageView itemImageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake25, 7, 65, 75] itemImageView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit itemImageView.tag  6 itemImageView.layer.shadowColor  [UIColor blackColor].CGColor itemImageView.layer.shadowOffset  CGSizeMake3, 1 itemImageView.layer.shadowOpacity  0.7 itemImageView.layer.shadowRadius  3.0 itemImageView.clipsToBounds  NO [cell.contentView addSubviewitemImageView] codepre  pWhen I add the shadow code, as seen above, scrolling performance is just totally killed and becomes choppy. Each image has a different codeRectcode so the shadow has to be created for each item as it scrolls. Anyone have any tips on how to add shadows to my images on a codeUITableViewcode without having this issuep

Negative 100064 pI have a Win32 program desktop app that works fine when debugging started by kbdF5kbd, but it doesnt paint the window, nor its title when run without debugging kbdCtrl  F5kbd. How is that possible  Im using VS 2010.p  pEdit in Release build the code works fine with without debugging, but it doesnt in the debugger, which is exactly the opposite of what happens in Debug build.p  pNew Editp  pAfter many hours working on this, I found out that the problem somehow is related to the initialization of a static stdautoptr object with its reset member function.p  pRemember what I said above, that the window title doesnt show on the app window, and this title is set up with SetWindowTexthwnd, LAny Title at the end of the WMCREATE message processing. I then started moving backwards this function call, within WMCREATE, to see exactly where it failed to exhibit the windows title. And that occurs after the first initialization of a static stdautoptr object like the pseudocode below p  precodeclass A  LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc HWND hwnd, UINT message, UINT wParam, LONG lParam      static stdautoptrltAgt a     switch  message               case WMCREATE                      ...             a.resetnew A             SetWindowTexthwnd, LAny Title             ...                  break          case WMPAINT          ...          break          case WMDESTROY          PostQuitMessage0         break          default          return DefWindowProchwnd, message, wParam, lParam          return 0  codepre  pThat means, if I call SetWindowText before the initialization of the variable codeacode, the window title is shown correctly, although it doesnt show any text on its client area, when the window gets painted. I know the window is being painted, for I inserted a codeMessageBeep1code in codeWMPAINTcode, and I can hear the sound.p  pIts also interesting to mention that everything that is printed in WMPAINT comes from codeclass Acode objects allocated on the heap, whose addresses are encapsulated in codestdautoptrcode objects.p  pOf course, all this is happening when executing the code with kbdCtrl  F5kbd. When the program is launched with kbdF5kbd everything works fine.p  pNew Edit p  pI changed the codestdautoptrcode variables to codeuniqueptrcode to no avail. The problem continues.     p

Negative 100064 pIm developing a library that provides access to gem metadata, including its location on the file system. The idea was to let gem authors set it to a relative path from any scriptp  precode rootexample.gemspec ExampleGem.root .         gt root   rootlibexamplegem.rb ExampleGem.root ....     gt root codepre  pThen, the path of the current script would be used to compute the absolute path. My implementation is currently as followsp  precodedef rootrelativeto  nil, file  FILE   unless relativeto.nil     root  File.expandpath relativeto, File.dirnamefile   end   root end codepre  pI thought codeFILEcode would return the path to the callers script, but that assumption is wrong.p  pIt worked within the library itself, but broke down when I tried to integrate it with one of my other gems the generated path was always relative to the support library itself.p  pHow can I implement this without having to pass the current codeFILEcode on every call Otherwise, there isnt much value to be gained writing coderoot...., FILEcode is almost the same as writing an actual method to do the same thing.p  pIf its possible to figure out the path without having to specify emanythingem, that would be even better, but I couldnt think of anything. How does Rails do itp  pBy the way, Im aware of a hrefhttpsgithub.comrubygemsrubygemsblobmasterlibrubygemsspecification.rbL1620 relnofollowcodeGemSpecificationgemdircodea, but it always returns paths relative to the installation directory, even if the gem is not actually there, which makes it useless in a development environment.p

Negative 100064 pQuick question. If i am trying to clear multiple divs with the same class all at once is there a jQuery short cut to doing this I tried code.clearit.emptycode and that does not seem to work at all none on the divs with that class are being cleared. Could I be doing this wrong or does this just not work Let me know, I tried code.clearit.htmlcode. Also I have this along with other code that runs after it in jquery and everything else runs as it should. I debugged the code and it seems to run the function and move on with no errors but the div content is not cleared.

The lis above are part of a ul with in id of slider. When i do codeslider.htmlcode or codeslider.emptycode It works but it clears all the div thus the players that load inside those divs dont load.

Negative 100064 pFirst of all, I want to make something clear before I get yelled at I have no plans to write any code that will ever use this sort of control flow its obviously terrible. Forget about a use case, this is more a question about whether its possible or notp  pI want to know if its possible to know if somewhere up the call stack, a function is being called within a catch block for a particular exception.p  pLets say I have a functionp  precodefoo  try      something  catch SuperException s      bar  codepre  pSo given NO control over the method signature of bar, and given bar is also called by many other functions, can bar behave differently if called in catch block catching a superexception and no, being called by foo isnt a sufficient condition, its the super exception that mattersp

This even means not implementing the QueryContextMenu, GetCommandString, or the invoke command.  Only error youll get with this set up is my original which is what we would expect since they are not implemented.  However switch that config manager back to Win32 and you get the expected errors such as 3 unresolved externals, and 3 errors following it naming GetCommandString, InvokeCommand, and QueryContextMenu.  Again expected if they arent implemented but why does the compiler on x64 recognize only my original error which is what a lot of people would assume it is, not implemented methods, but on the win32 set it shows the full  errors when not implemented.p  pThe previous paragraph was just something I noticed.  I do have all 3 methods implemented correctly and compiles correctly in Win32 but not x64.p

Negative 100064 pFirstly, I am aware that there are quite a few questions that are similar to this one in SO. I have read most, if not all of them, over the past week. But I still cant make this work for me.p  pI am developing a Ruby on Rails app that allows users to upload mp3 files to Amazon S3. The upload itself works perfectly, but a progress bar would greatly improve user experience on the website.p  pI am using the awssdk gem which is the official one from Amazon. I have looked everywhere in its documentation for callbacks during the upload process, but I couldnt find anything.p  pThe files are uploaded one at a time directly to S3 so it doesnt need to load it into memory. No multiple file upload necessary either.p  pI figured that I may need to use JQuery to make this work and I am fine with that. I found this that looked very promising a hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUpload relnofollowhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploada And I even tried following the example here a hrefhttpsgithub.comncris3uploaderexample relnofollowhttpsgithub.comncris3uploaderexampleap  pBut I just could not make it work for me.p  pThe documentation for awssdk also BRIEFLY describes streaming uploads with a blockp  precode  obj.write do buffer, bytes       writing fewer than the requested number of bytes to the buffer       will cause write to stop yielding to the block   end codepre  pBut this is barely helpful. How does one write to the buffer I tried a few intuitive options that would always result in timeouts. And how would I even update the browser based on the bufferingp  pIs there a better or simpler solution to thisp  pThank you in advance.  I would appreciate any help on this subject.p

Negative 100064 pWhat I ultimately want to be able to do is to have a circle follow a path that is updated by a server real time.  Think of it as a target following a line.  I already know how to make a circle follow a path thanks to this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgyeSf17 relnofollowfiddlea.  But my problems come from how to update the line and course of the circle dynamically as ultimately I want a target to follow data being generated by a server and I am not sure how to do it.p  pFor ease of testing I have created a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netyTmMz2 relnofollowjsFiddlea allowing you to click on the screen to place a point, with the aim of this simulating the server data.  The circle shouldl then move towards each point in turn as you click it.p  pSo how do I update an existing path and make the animation continue seamlessly without affecting previous parts of the pathp

Negative 100064 pCould you validate my approach for using Firebase to manage a user notification systemp  pBasically I want to have user specific channels as well as more general channels which hold notifications.  These notifications would appear on an intranet if the user has not viewed them before.p  pThe idea being a server side action will update Firebase endpoints using the REST API either for a specific user or broadcast to everyone.  The specific user messages I can easily mark as read and therefore not show them again, its the general broadcast I am struggling slightly with.p  pI could add a flaguser ID to the general broadcast to indicate its read but I am concerned about performance as the client would have to check historic broadcast messages for the existence of this flag.  I could add a user id to create a new endpoint which should be quicker.br e.g. notificationgeneral   contains the message, this triggers the client which then checks to see if usersUSERIDMessageID exists if it doesnt display the message and create this end point.p  pIs there something I am missing or is that the best approachp

Negative 100064 pI am currently working on getting the Flexmojos project to build with the new Adobe Flex 4.8. The problem is, that with 4.8 one feature is no longer available. If I run the unittests against this sdk, the build will fail. I could disable the failling tests alltogether, but I would like to keep them in place, as they test important features of older Flex SDKs.p  pIs there a way to automatically have tests skipped if a precondition is not met I was thinking of some method being called to decide if a test should be executed. Alternatively I could set an environment variable. If there is any other option I would be glad to hear.p  pChrisp

Negative 100064 pRecently I started getting PermGen space issue in my new jasper report application when tested under heavy load. Im using groovy as expression evaluator for reports, by specifying codelanguagegroovycode in my jrxml file. As groovy expressions, create classes at runtime, Im suspecting this to be the root cause for permgen filling up. I tried up setting up jvm options like strongXXUseConcMarkSweepGC XXCMSClassUnloadingEnabledstrong , but it did not help in solving the problem. Even in excpetion stacktrace given below also, classloader is trying to load the newly built class into permgen at the time of failure. Has anyone experienced this problem using groovy with jasper reports My reports get filled asynchronously in a separate thread using capabalities provided by codeAsynchronousFillHandlecode class provided by jasper. Does this have any connection towards the classloader not releasing the loaded runtime classes Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  precode Exception in thread Thread563 java.lang.OutOfMemoryError PermGen space Exception in thread Thread565        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1Native Method         at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCondUnknown Source         at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassUnknown Source         at org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ClassLoaderForClassArtifacts.defineClassLoaderForClassArtifacts.java42         at org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ClassLoaderForClassArtifacts1.runClassLoaderForClassArtifacts.java86         at org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ClassLoaderForClassArtifacts1.runClassLoaderForClassArtifacts.java84         at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method         at org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ClassLoaderForClassArtifacts.defineClassAndGetConstructorClassLoaderForClassArtifacts.java84         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteGenerator.compilePogoMethodCallSiteGenerator.java215         at org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.CachedMethod.createPogoMetaMethodSiteCachedMethod.java220         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.PogoMetaMethodSite.createCachedMethodSitePogoMetaMethodSite.java206         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.PogoMetaMethodSite.createPogoMetaMethodSitePogoMetaMethodSite.java182         at groovy.lang.MetaClassImpl.createPogoCallCurrentSiteMetaClassImpl.java3034         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteArray.createCallCurrentSiteCallSiteArray.java93         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteArray.defaultCallCurrentCallSiteArray.java44         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.AbstractCallSite.callCurrentAbstractCallSite.java141         at org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.AbstractCallSite.callCurrentAbstractCallSite.java149         at Section11348126593121343308.evaluatecalculatorSection11348126593121343308253         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JREvaluator.evaluateJREvaluator.java190         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRCalculator.evaluateJRCalculator.java591         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRCalculator.evaluateJRCalculator.java559         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRFillElement.evaluateExpressionJRFillElement.java884         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRFillTextField.evaluateTextJRFillTextField.java421         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRFillTextField.evaluateJRFillTextField.java406         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRFillElementContainer.evaluateJRFillElementContainer.java257         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRFillBand.evaluateJRFillBand.java457         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRVerticalFiller.fillColumnBandJRVerticalFiller.java2037         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRVerticalFiller.fillDetailJRVerticalFiller.java771         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRVerticalFiller.fillReportContentJRVerticalFiller.java301         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRVerticalFiller.fillReportJRVerticalFiller.java148         at net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRBaseFiller.fillJRBaseFiller.java909 codepre

Negative 100064 p[I asked something similar before. This is a more focused version.]p  pWhat can cause a servers select call on a TCP socket to consistently timeout rather than see the clients close of the socket On the clients side, the socket is a regular socketcreated blocking socket that successfully connects to the server and successfully transmits a roundtrip transaction. On the servers side, the socket is created via an accept call, is blocking, is passed to a child server process via fork, is closed by the toplevel server, and is successfully used by the child server process in the initial transaction. When the client subsequently closes the socket, the select call of the child server process consistently timesout after 1 minute rather than indicating a readready condition on the socket. The select call looks for readready conditions only the writeready and exception arguments are NULL.p  pHeres the simplified but logically equivalent selectusing code in the child server processp  precodeint onesvcrun     const int           sock,     const unsigned      timeout       struct timeval      timeo     fdset              fds      timeo.tvsec  timeout     timeo.tvusec  0      FDZEROampfds     FDSETsock, ampfds      for           fdset      readFds  fds         int         status  selectsock1, ampreadFds, 0, 0, amptimeo          if status lt 0             return errno          if status  0             return ETIMEDOUT           This code not reached when client closes socket           The timeout structure, timeo, is appropriately reset here          ...                      ...  codepre  pHeres the logical equivalent of the sequence of events on the clientside errorhandling not shownp  precodestruct sockaddrin raddr  ...  int sock  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, IPPROTOTCP voidbindresvportsock, struct sockaddrin 0 connectsock, struct sockaddr raddr, sizeofraddr  Send a message to the server and receive a reply  voidclosesock codepre  pfork, exec, and system are never called.

When it comes to compilation and linking p  precodegcc dynamic ILibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersionsCurrentincludepython2.7 c palindrome.c  gcc dynamic ILibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersionsCurrentincludepython2.7 c palindromewrap.c codepre  pIf I do these commands as the book says I dont see any visible problem, however there is something wrong with the next stepp  precodegcc dynamiclib palindromewrap.o palindrome.o o palindrome.so Wl, undefined, dynamiclookup i686appledarwin11llvmgcc4.2 dynamiclookup No such file or directory  codepre  pThe example Im running through is from the textbook word for word and its a beginners book, naturally Im stumped only just learning about using c and c to make libraries for other languages. I suspect its probably that something has changed regards files or directories on the mac since the book was written I picked mac to learn this since its closer to unix than windows. Compilation steps still look rather arcane to me so hopefully someone know what is wrong here.p  pThanks,p  pBen W.p

Negative 100064 pI am trying to update a MySQL table with an expiration date. Ive collected a timestamp value for all my rows as people have registered into the table but now I want to create an expiration date relative to that timestamp not to relative to the current time. Heres my codep  precodetimestamp  row[timestamp] sqlupdate   UPDATE jobs SET expirationdate  DATEADDtimestamp,INTERVAL 56 DAY resultupdate  mysqligtquerysqlupdate or diemysqligterror codepre  pUnderstand that this is being run in a while loop so its running through each row of the table an updating them as it goes. The issue is that I ran it once and all it did was update the expirationdate row to 56 days from NOW not 56 days from the timestamps value. The timestamp is set on CURRENTTIMESTAMP for when the a new entry is registered which Im assuming is the problem. Ive echoed out timestamp to troubleshoot and it echoes out the correct value not the current time when I echo it but when it goes to actually update the expiration date it seems to be drawing from the fact that its a CURRENTTIMESTAMP. Is there a way to explicit query for the value of the timestampp  pIm hoping to find a way that doesnt involved restructuring the database. I know I could have it so instead of a timestamp row, I could make it a datetime row and set it to the value of NOW when database is being initially queried to add a row but Id prefer to find a solution within the way the table is currently set up.

Negative 100064 pProposed for inclusion in C14 aka C1y are some new thread synchronization primitives latches and barriers.

Unfortunately, I think the sample code invokes undefined behavior.  The proposal says of codelatchlatchcodep  blockquote   pDestroys the latch. If the latch is destroyed while other threads are in codewaitcode, or are invoking codecountdowncode, the behaviour is undefined.p blockquote  pNote that it says in codewaitcode and not blocked in codewaitcode, as the description of codecountdowncode uses.p  pThen the following sample is providedp  blockquote   pAn example of the second use case is shown below. We need to load data and then process it using a number of threads. Loading the data is IO bound, whereas starting threads and creating data structures is CPU bound. By running these in parallel, throughput can be increased.  p  precodevoid DoWork      latch startlatch1     vectorltthreadgt workers     for int i  0 i lt NTHREADS i        workers.pushbacknew thread[amp]           Initialize data structures.

Threads can now start processing     startlatch.countdown  codepre blockquote  pIsnt there a race condition between the threads waking and returning from codewaitcode, and destruction of the latch when it leaves scope  Besides that, all the codethreadcode objects are leaked.  If the scheduler doesnt run all worker threads before codecountdowncode returns and the codestartlatchcode object leaves scope, then I think undefined behavior will result.  Presumably the fix is to iterate the vector and codejoincode and codedeletecode all the worker threads after codecountdowncode but before returning.p  ol liIs there a problem with the sample codeli liDo you agree that a proposal should show a complete correct example, even if the task is extremely simple, in order for reviewers to see what the use experience will be likeli ol  hr  pNote It appears possible that one or more of the worker threads havent yet begun to wait, and will therefore call codewaitcode on a destroyed latch.p  hr  pUpdate Theres now a new version of the proposal, but the representative example is unchanged.p

The departments collection doesnt really need to do anything, since its selected property is already correct really, its view just needs to rerender.

Furthermore, it should be reading the text contained in gulpcommand.p  p2 The programs report provided via standard output appears in the terminal. This is odd because the purpose of this piping is to transfer stdout to my string receiveoutput. But since it is appearing on screen, that indicates to me that the information is not being passed correctly through the pipe to the variable.

I appreciate any help you can give mep  pEDIT Clarificationp  pMy program currently communicates with another program using text files. My program writes a text file e.g. input.txt, which is read by the external program. That program then produces output.txt, which is read by my program. So its something like thisp  precodemy code gt input.txt gt program gt output.txt gt my code codepre  pTherefore, my code currently uses,p  precodesystemprogram lt input.txt gt output.txt codepre  pI want to replace this process using pipes. I want to pass my input as standard input to the program, and have my code read the standard output from that program into a string.p

Negative 100064 pI have already sort of asked this question already here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17788021compositiontargetrenderingnotbeingcalledwhenonpointermovedeventPrevious Questiona but it only got a handful of views and zero answerscomments so I thought Id give it a go again with some more info that Ive found.p  pI basically have a Windows Store DirectX  XAML app that Im developing. I currently have the problem that the Rendering event of the strongSwapChainBackgroundPanelstrong that I use for DirectX rendering as per the Windows 8 example on MSDN sometimes isnt called when the user is interacting with the app.p  pIt will continue to update if I am doing something with the camera such as changing what its looking at based on touchmouse position but it wont be called if I am picking and I dont know why.p  pI use the standard GPU picking method where I render the scene with a unique color for each object and then take a 1x1 texture of the press area to find the selected object but when I am using this picking technique to select multiple objects the user drags their fingermouse over many objects Rendering isnt being called. So in effect what happens is, lots of objects get selected but the user only sees this when they remove their fingerstop pressing the mouse button.p  pIs there any reason why this is happening Is it because of the GPU picking method And if so is there a way around it rather than using the raytrace picking method which considerably slows down picking for a large number of objectsp  pHas anyone else had this problem Is there an explanation from Microsoft anywhere that it is deliberate that rendering doesnt get called while this is happeningp  pThanks for your time.p

It is much better to display the error with the form           and allow the user to correct their mistake.  However, that is an           exercise for you to implement yourself.          diePlease confirm your password.             if POST[password]  POST[confirmpassword]            An INSERT query is used to add new rows to a database table.

The output of this next statement is a 64 byte hex           string representing the 32 byte sha256 hash of the password.  The original           password cannot be recovered from the hash.          password  hashsha256, POST[password] . salt            Next we hash the hash value 65536 more times.  The purpose of this is to           protect against brute force attacks.  Now an attacker must compute the hash 65537           times for each guess they make against a password, whereas if the password           were hashed only once the attacker would have been able to make 65537 different            guesses in the same amount of time instead of only one.          forround  0 round lt 65536 round                        password  hashsha256, password . salt                      try                         Execute the query to create the user              stmt  dbgtpreparequery              stmtgtexecutearray             password gt password,             salt gt salt,             id gt id                      catchPDOException ex                         Note On a production website, you should not output exgtgetMessage.

Negative 100064 pI am modifying some code that has a custom calendar control using a codeDateTimePickercode for a codeDataGridViewcode. I have set codeShowCheckBox  truecode and I am trying to force it to change the value of the date to null when the user clicks on the checkbox by changing the codeCustomFormatcode of the Date, which works. My issue is that it takes too many clicks on the checkbox to change the DateFormat. My basic CalendarColumn comes from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7tas5c80.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7tas5c80.aspxa, but that didnt include a checkbox and didnt allow null values.p  pMy codeOnValueChangedcode code isp  precode    protected override void OnValueChangedEventArgs eventargs               Notify the DataGridView that the contents of the cell           have changed.         base.OnValueChangedeventargs          if this.Checked                      this.Checked  true             this.Format  DateTimePickerFormat.Short          else if this.Checked                      this.Format  DateTimePickerFormat.Custom             this.CustomFormat                  codepre  pThe first click on the checkbox when its value is checked greys out the date, but does not fire the codeOnValueChangedcode method, the second click sets it back to checked, and fires the event, and the 3rd click sets the codeCustomFormatcode to   and therefore displays a null date as it should.p  pIve done some research, and I think that my issue is something to do with gaining focus of the cell on the first click, but if I put my check in the codeonGotFocuscode, a single click will showhide the date format as it should, but then when I click onto another cell after unchecking the checkbox, it remains with the codeCustomFormatcode set as   rather than codeDateTimePickerFormat.Shortcode.p  pOther answers on a similar subject refer to a hrefhttpwww.mofeel.net70microsoftpublicdotnetframeworkwindowsforms8806.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.mofeel.net70microsoftpublicdotnetframeworkwindowsforms8806.aspxa, but Im confused as to how I would incorporate this into my code.

Negative 100064 pIm working on implementing a build system using scons for a somewhat large software project. There is a directory structure which separates the code for individual libraries and programs into their own directories. With our existing make system, I can do a make clean in a single program directory and it will only clean the files associated with the source in that directory. If I do an scons c though, it recognizes that the program depends on a slew of libraries that are in sibling or cousin directories and cleans all of the files for those as well. This is not what I want since I then have to rebuild all of these libraries which can take several minutes.p  pI have tried playing with the NoClean command, but have not gotten it to work in the way I need. Given the size of the code base and complexity of the directory structure, I cant realistically have a NoClean line for every file in every library.p  pIs there any way to tell scons to ignore any dependencies above the current directory when doing a clean i.e. scons c p

Negative 100064 pI am working on porting an iOS App to WP8. The iOS app is localized to 5 different languages. The localized strings are stored in different files. For example app.strings hold all strings unique for the app and common.strings hold strings that are used in other apps as well. Of course there are 5 versions of each .strings file app.de.strings, app.en.strings, .....p  pIn the iOS code I can simple refere to StringID123 and the system will automatically search for that string in all .strings files and display the correct value, no matter if this string can be found in app.strings, common.strings or elsewhere. Is this possible on WP8 as well p  pVS automatically created two files to support localizationp  ul listrongAppResources.resxstrong which holds the actual strings with strongAppRessources.Designer.csstrong as code behindli listrongLocalizedStrings.csstrong which is a helper class to support bindingli ul  pOf course I could add additional .resx files to the project and use them create the same structure as in the iOS project. But then I would have to add additional versions of LocalizedStrings.cs e.g. LocalizedStringsCommon.cs which refere to the correct .resx as well. Then I would have to explicitly use the correct Souce in XAML.p  pI would have to know where StringID123 is defines. Is there any way to let XAMLC do that automaticallyp

My scope variable ends up with an empty collection.  Never gets populated.

Frustrating.p  pI have put stops in codeangelFireCollectioncode factory function and can see that the data is getting added to the collection in the callbacks inside that function but my binded variable never gets updated.p  pUPDATE Ok experimenting with a plnkr.  It seems that codeangularFireCollectioncode EXPECTS your returning a LIST of items.  The snapshot returns properly if you inspect codesnapshot.valcode it will be whatever object structure was stored in firebase.  IF you use codeangularFireCollectioncode it does indeed bind to the variable HOWEVER it turns a nonlist object into a garbled mess and you can not access the object user the normal dot operator.  This is either a bug or it is a severe limitation of codeangularFireCollectioncode which will cause me to revaluate how easily I can use firebase as the backend.  I cant share my plnkr because it is accessing nonpublic data but tomorrow if i have time I will create a public firebase with an object store and demonstrate.p

Everything is encoded via base64. For examplep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar returnURL  httpssubdomain.main.comparams   On Form Submission function SubmitFormtype       var paramURL  user  userID  amptime  now  amptype  ptype       base64 encoding via btoa     donate [namereturn].val returnURL  btoaparamURL       Reday to submit form     PayPalForm.submit   codepre  p3. Paypal donation is done and user is redirected to a subdomain of the extensions website with https enabled.p  p4. Once on my website, some PHP code checks the referrer i.e. is the user coming from PayPal, and if the referrer looks good, it decodes the base64 string and gets the parameters id, time, type.... For examplep  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecode Retrieve URL parameters paramURL  parseurlbase64decodeGET[a] parsestrparamURL[query], query  iduser  query[user]  ID of the user timereq  query[time]  Time of requestdonation typereq  query[type]  Type of Premium license w.r.t amount donated codepre  p5. At this stage, the idea is to create a new URL pointing to the options page of my Chrome extension with some existing and new parameters, strongamong them the key that decrypts a part of the code encrypted by default when the user installs the extensionstrong. The first issue I meet is that I wish to find a way to encrypt those parameters in PHP and be able to decrypt them in Javascript in my extension.p  pWhat kind of symmetric encryptionciphering method available both in PHP and JS should I use AES256 On the JS side, I looked at the a hrefhttpscode.google.compcryptojsHMACSHA256 relnofollowCryptoJSa and a hrefhttpbitwiseshiftleft.github.iosjcl relnofollowSJCLa libraries. On the PHP side, AES encryption seems a bit a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6770370aes256encryptioninphptrickya...p  p6. Once the user is back to the extensions options page and that the URL parameters are decodeddecrypted, what would be your strategy to unlock specific features in a Javascriptwritten extension in order to limit cheating and freeriding coming from users, knowing that obfuscation is a very poor choice.p

Negative 100064 pHi Im working on a hangman program in C for my programming course and I have a problem. Below is the code where I have the problemp  precodechar UserGuess int i, x int WrongGuesses fori  0 i lt MAXTRIES i      printfGo ahead and guess a lettern     UserGuess  getchar     for x  0 x lt len x         if randomWordfomFile[x]  UserGuess             UserGuess  randomWordfromFile[x]         else if             break  printfs, randomWordfromFile[] codepre  pMAXTRIES is a macro and randomWordfromFile is an array that I get from another function. I can post the code for that function if required.p  pMy problem is that I cant keep track of how many guesses the User got wrong and has left. Also if I want to add further functionality the loops inside loops make it harder as far as I can see. Is there an easier method or is this the best way to do itp

Negative 100064 pIm using codevclickcode from jQuery mobile to eliminate the click delay on mobile devices.  It mostly works fine, however if I have a scrollable element and I touchscroll it, codevclickcode is fired at the coordinates where I touched the element to initiate the scroll.p  pI have a scrollable list, where clickingtapping an item initiates some further actions.  When I simply scroll the list, the codevclickcode is fired on the item which I touched to scroll the whole list.  I havent found any ways around it.p  pHow can I get around it  I only want the vclick on actual tap, not on scroll.p  pI can, probably, handle the codetouchstartcode event and save the coordinates.  Then handle codetouchendcode event instead of codevclickcode and compare the coordinates with those from codetouchstartcode  and only perform actions if they are the same.  Yet this sounds really ugly to me.p  pstrongEDITstrong using codetapcode instead of codevclickcode exhibits the same behavior, therefore its also not a solution.p

Negative 100064 pI am trying to make two get requests to a DB using javascript, the first one allows me to grab a value from a db which decides the color of  a water tank, and the second one the level.

Negative 100064 pI am trying to implement a pattern matching syntax and language. I know of regular expressions but these arent enough for my scopes. I have individuated some mathematical operators. In the examples that follow I will suppose that the subject of pattern mathing are character strings but it isnt necessary.p  pHaving read the description bellow The question is, does any body knows of a mathematical theory explicitating that or any language that takes the same approach implementing it  I would like to look at it in order to have ideas p  pDescprition of approachp  pAt first we have characters. Characters may be aggregated to form strings.p  pA pattern is a a single character b an ordered group of patterns with the operator matchAny c an ordered group of patterns with the operator matchAll d other various operators to see later on.p  pExplanation  We have a subject character string and a starting position.p  pIf we check for a match of a single character, then if it matches it moves the current position forward by one position.p  pIf we check for a match of an ordered group of patterns with the operator matchAny then it will check each element of the group in sequence and we will have a proliferation of starting positions that will get multiplied by the number of possible matches being advanced by the length of the match.p  pE.G suppose the group of patterns is  a aba ab x dd   and the string under examination is Dabaxddc with current position 2  counting from 1 . Then applying matchAny with the previous group we have that a mathces aba matches and ab matches while x and dd do not match. After having those matches there are 3 starting positions 3 4 5  corresponding to a ab aba .p  pWe may continue our pattern matching by accepting to have more then one starting positions. So now we may continue to the next case under examination and check for a matchAll. matchAll means that all patterns must match sequentially and are applied sequentially. subcases of matchAll are match0 match1 etc.p  pI have to add that the same fact to try to ask the question has already helped me and cleared me out some things. But I would like to know of similar approaches in order to study them. Please only languages used by you and not bibliography  p

Negative 100064 pI am having trouble understanding at a fundamental level how a one to many relationship should be managed in Entity Framework. In my application I have two tables, codeDISPLAYMASTERcode, and codeDISPLAYITEMScode. Their relationship is like sop  pDISPLAYMASTER.DISPLAYID strong1strong DISPLAYITEMS.DISPLAYIDp  pEntity Framework organizes this really intuitively. I am left with a strongly typed codeDISPLAYMASTERcode object that has an codeICollectioncode property called codeDISPLAYITEMScode.p  pMy confusion lies within how to save the codeDISPLAYITEMScode collection back to the database. In my application I am reading in all of the codeDISPLAYITEMScode for the particular codeDISPLAYMASTERcode using LINQ into a codeListltDISPLAYITEMSgtcode object called codedisplayItemscode. This is then bound to a codeDataGridcode for editing using MVVM. The user can edit existing codeDISPLAYITEMScode, delete existing codeDISPLAYITEMScode, or add new codeDISPLAYITEMScode using the codeDataGridcode. My binding works perfectly and these changes are reflected in codedisplayItemscode. Once it comes time to save is where I stop feeling confident in my code. When the user clicks save I am setting the codeDISPLAYMASTERcodes codeICollectioncode like sop  precodedisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMS  displayItems codepre  pIs this the proper way to be working on an Entity Framework collection Or should I be binding the codeDataGridcode directly to the codedisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMScode object Or some other method The reason I am not confident is because if I try to validate the codedisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMScode entity usingp  precodeDbEntityValidationResult validationResults  context.EntrydisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMS.GetValidationResult codepre  pI get an error saying List1 is not part of the collection, which obviously doesnt seem right.p  pAny advice or guidance would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 100064 pI have desktop application A1.exe written in .NET C and I would like to create something like A1API.dll, that could be used by other third party applications for interprocess two way communication with my application A1.exe.p  pI already have some prototype of A1API.dll that is based on IPC Remoting. In the dll there is Client.cs MarshalByRefObject class containing its own thread that keeps connection to instance of Server.cs MarshalByRefObject class by checking it every second. This construction allows to my A1.exe application to be restarted with automatic reconnection of all Clients which are also registered in Server for listening to A1.exe events. Also, if any client app is unexpectedly closed, server removes it from its collection of clients because it starts throwing errors even when method Client.Equals is called. This trouble I solved with ClientWrapper.cs class.p  pThis all works quite qoodp  pLet say, that the library A1API.dll would be published on the internet as an API to my A1.exe application.p  pNow, I have got a problem. What if I will need to change A1API.dll in the future and extend for example some enumeration that is used in some public Server.cs method Shall I use, in this case, string type insteadp  pIn the scenario with enumeration, I will extend my A1.exe and A1API.dll, publish it, and then all clients depending on A1API.dll will break if only A1.exe will be reinstalled.p  pstrongWhat is the best solution for this whole thingstrongp  pI will also appreciate any idea of improvement  change of my IPC solution. Thanks.p

Im using codewtcode to scale the size of points, and I want codedayscode to control the transparancy of the points. My problem is when I plot over multiple pages. The legend and transparency seem to relate to the range of values in each facet. codedayscode will always take on values 07, and I would like to display the full scale on each page, and also the transparancy level consistent on all pages. As of right now, one page will display an alpha legend consisting of numbers 2 and 3, while another page will have 0 to 6, all depending on what the range is for the groups on that page.

You may not wish to hardcode       things such as file lengths into your executable... and you may wish to       turn this code off during application development.           private static class XAPKFile          public final boolean mIsMain         public final int mFileVersion         public final long mFileSize          XAPKFileboolean isMain, int fileVersion, long fileSize              mIsMain  isMain             mFileVersion  fileVersion             mFileSize  fileSize                           Here is where you place the data that the validator will use to determine       if the file was delivered correctly. This is encoded in the source code       so the application can easily determine whether the file has been       properly delivered without having to talk to the server. If the       application is using LVL for licensing, it may make sense to eliminate       these checks and to just rely on the server.           private static final XAPKFile[] xAPKS               new XAPKFile                     true,  true signifies a main file                     4,  the version of the APK that the file was uploaded                         against                     240000L  the length of the file in bytes             ,             new XAPKFile                     true,  false signifies a patch file                     3,  the version of the APK that the patch file was uploaded                         against                     24000L  the length of the patch file in bytes                                           Go through each of the APK Expansion files defined in the structure above       and determine if the files are present and match the required size. Free       applications should definitely consider doing this, as this allows the       application to be launched for the first time without having a network       connection present.

The basic idea is that our librarian can double click and build it in its various configurations.

Negative 100064 pI am in the happy position of replacing a Windows 8 Metro app with a Chrome packaged app. For the time being, it needs to mimic the look and feel of the Metro app. The main page consists of multiple webviews arranged horizontally with a large amount of horizontal scrolling possible. I have run into a problem when attempting to scroll horizontally using a touch device. If the scroll gesture starts on a webview, it is capturing the scroll event and preventing the host from scrolling. Overflow is hidden on all of the webviews. As they form the bulk of the content on the page then the valid scroll targets for the host are limited.p  pThe webview contents are interactive so I cant get away with placing a transparent overlay over the scrollable content to capture the event, at least not without some way to propagate the clickstouches through to the webviews themselves.p  pAny ideas on how this could be achievedp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 100064 pIm currently trying to teach myself some responsive design, and just wanted some opinions on the best way of tackling the problem that I have. Ive decided to start by making an existing project of mine a hrefhttpsgithub.comantm611MusicServerGUI relnofollowhttpsgithub.comantm611MusicServerGUIa functional on a mobile device. Im going to do this by stripping out the Twitter Bootstrap library and using my own CSS.p  pAs you can see from the screenshot on GitHub, the main Albums view has a pane on the left to select an artist, and a pane on the right to display albums by the selected artist. I have achieved this with two separate unordered lists. However, my plan for devices with smaller viewports will be to display this as one list, arranged in the following structurep  ul liArtist 1li liArtist 2 selected ul liAlbum 1li liAlbum 2 selected ul liTrack 1li liTrack 2li ulli liAlbum 3li ulli liArtist 3li ul  pIf I was just designing the mobile site standalone, I would achieve this with nested lists as above. However, this would require the actual HTML to be different. As I understand responsive design, the goal is normally to use the same markup, but change the way it is displayed to the user based on media queries.p  pIf someone could point me in the best way to tackle this sort of problem, I would be very grateful.p  pThanks very muchp
Negative 100064 pI am having an issue with preventing repeated clicks of the same element that can produce unwanted results. I cannot use jquerys one because this event is attached to many elements, including children of the clicked element. p  pEssentially I have a div. The user may click on the div and it will make an AJAX request to load another div. The user may accidentally click the div again as I have done often and this will result in two AJAX requests and load two child divs. There is logic to prevent further children if the child is already found, but during the loading of the AJAX request it is possible to request it again. The same element should not be able to be clicked twice and request to AJAX requests. However multiple elements could be potentially clicked at the same time. p  pEach child div can also load more children using the exact same onclick handler. What can I do to prevent repeated clicks sending multiple AJAX requests without using jquerys one p  pTHe below is just an example but this is the logicp  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv id  parent class  buttongt Click Me ltdivgt codepre  pJQUERYp  precode.button.onclick, function   var data  getsomedata   .posturl, data, functiondata     .resultDiv.afterdata     codepre  pPHPp  precodefunction someData db, request   do some database request   echo ltdiv class  child buttongt I am a child table that is also clickable ltdivgt  codepre
Negative 100064 pI am trying to generate a csv file from json data using Angular.js.p  pWhen I get the data from my server, the user sees it in a table and can use various filters on the data. When the user filters it as desired, I want them to be able to create a csv report.p  pInstead of sending the filters back to the server to generate the file. I would like to do it directly from the filtered data in Angular.p  pRight now, I have thisp  precodescope.getReport  gt       filteredItems  filterfilterscope.records, scope.query       filteredItems  filterorderByfilteredItems, scope.tableSort.getOrderProp        csvRows  []       csvRows.pushTitle,Assigned ID,Last Name,First Name,Start Date,Complete Date,Page,Test Progress,Certificate        csvRows.pushrecord.course.title,record.course.assignedid,record.user.last,record.user.first,record.startdate,record.completedate,record.page,record.testprogress,record.getcert for record in filteredItems       csvString  csvRows.joinrn        report  document.createElementa       angular.elementreport         .attrhref, dataapplicationcsvcharsetutf8,  encodeURI csvString         .attrdownload, report.csv       console.logreport       document.body.appendChildreport       report.click codepre  pIts a bit messy, but it seems to work in Firefox and Chrome. I need something that will work in IE9 as well.p  pAnother option I was thinking, but I cant figure out how to do would be to use a form and send the json data to the server. I can then have the server respond with a CSV file. My problem here is that I dont know how to get the json data to the server without using Ajax which wont download the file returned.p  h2Updateh2  pI dont think its the best method, but I am using a combination of my two solutions. I have javascript create the CSV like above. Then when I submit a form, it adds the csvString as the value of a hidden form input.

Negative 100064 pIve been having a go at learning React.js by writing a small calculator application. I thought things were going quite well until I learned that setState is asynchronous and my mutations therefore do not get immediately applied.p  pSo my question is, what is the best way to keep a running total based upon the values being added to an input. Take the following examplep  precodevar Calculator  React.createClass   total  0,    getInitialState  function     return         value  0        ,    onValueClicked  function value      var actual, total, current  this.state.value      ifvalue          actual  this.total  parseIntthis.total, 10  parseIntcurrent, 10      else        ifparseIntcurrent, 10  0          actual  value        else          actual  current.toString  value                  this.setState value  actual    ,    render  function       return        ltdiv classNamecalcmaingt         ltCalcDisplay valuethis.state.value gt         ltCalcButtonGroup range010 onClickthis.onValueClicked gt         ltCalcOpButton type onClickthis.onValueClicked gt       ltdivgt           var CalcDisplay  React.createClass   render  function       return        ltinput typetext namedisplay valuethis.props.value gt           var CalcButtonGroup  React.createClass   render  function       var i, buttons  [], range  this.props.range.split      fori  range[0] i lt range[1] i        var handler  this.props.onClick.bindnull, i        buttons.pushltCalcNumberButton keyi onClick handler  gt           return        ltdiv classNamecalcbtngroupgt buttons ltdivgt           var CalcNumberButton  React.createClass   render  function       return        ltbutton onClickthis.props.onClickgtthis.props.keyltbuttongt           var CalcOpButton  React.createClass   render  function       var handler, op  this.props.type      handler  this.props.onClick.bindnull, op      return        ltbutton onClickhandlergtopltbuttongt           React.renderComponentltCalculator gt, document.getElementByIdcontainer codepre  pIn the example above I gave up completely on storing the total within the state and kept it outside. Ive read that you can have a callback run when setState has finished but in the case of a calculator I need it to be snappy and update quickly. If the state isnt getting updated with each button press and I quickly hit the buttons  things are going to fall out of sync. Is the callback all I am missing or am I thinking about this in completely the wrong wayp  pAny help appreciatedp
Negative 100064 pSo Im trying to develop a module for my web application that pushes a content feed to our Google Search Appliance GSA using PHP cURL to transmit the data to the appliance as POST information via port 19900.

Negative 100064 pSo I am designing a RESTful web service for my personal web site.  I am going to use angular.js to render the json passed back from my web service.  I have the basics for HalJsonRenderer and HalJsonCollectionRenderer set up.  I have my domain resources and url mappings configured, and for the most part everything works.p  pHowever its not marshalling deep enough.  As an example, I have a domain object called blog and the blog has one to many comments.

Thanks for your time.p  pEDIT I am aware I could just alter the renderer and have it add it manually, but I assume that there is a better way to do it.  Like is there a function in the HalJsonRenderer that will take return the url for a given resource  Other than createLink  I guess I will investigate the source code for HalJsonRenderer.p  pEDIT I found that HalJsonRenderer extends AbstractLinkRenderer.  In there, there is a function called renderAssociationLinks.  In there, there is no case for rendering one to many associations, only many to one.  So I dont know if this is a bug, or if its this way by design.  I am going to err on the side of caution and say its by design.  I tried modifying this code in my implementation, and although I was able to get it to start adding one to many relationships, it was producing the wrong URI.  Am I chasing ghosts herep

Negative 100064 pI am trying to set up an set of programs consisting ofp  ul lia UI or perhaps multiple UIsli lia server li lia number of workers. li ul  pThe UI is how a user interacts with the system, the server does processing and marshalling, and the workers handle a wide range of hardware devices. Additionally, any number of these elements might be on different platforms C, C, Java, Python being the primary ones so far, and different physical machines. The workers are not interchangeable  the server knows which one can do what based on what the worker tells it about itself.p  pFor example, imagining that the worker could make coffee, something like thisp  ul liWorker A to server Hi, Im a coffee machine and Im ready to goli liServer to UI Hi, I have a coffee machine hereli liUI to server some time later User wants a coffee now, since you have a machineli liServer to UI Working on that.

Threading within each program is not a problem, unless the communication sockets are all tied up waiting for responsesp  pI was planning to use ZeroMQ to organise all of this, and I have a rudimentary REQREQ lockstep working between the server and the workers, and between the UI and server. However, the synchronous nature of this doesnt seem to work well when a hardware device could take a long time to complete what was asked of it.p  pIt also doesnt seem to allow me to do something like have the server notify the UI about changes, and workers notify the server about their status changes, without setting up a second port on each link.p  pDoes ZeroMQ or another MQ, even have a way to handle this kind of setupp

Negative 100064 pI have been using the latest Toolbar from AppCompatv7 lib.I have placed a textview in the ToolBar ViewGroup And I want to set a title into this Textview from the fragment in my activity.In case of a custom action bar ActionBarActivitygetActivity.setcustomView.. would have done the job.But due to use of this ToolBar I am not able to use that.Also I have implemented a method in my BaseActivity that is inherited by all Activities.This BaseActivity contains my method to initialize a sliding drawer to the left.I have to initialize the initDrawerLayout method in activity else the drawer would not be initialized.And if I initialize it in fragment its giving me all empty results,neither the toggle button for drawer and nor is the custom title getting set.p  pThis is my initDrawer code..p  precodepublic void initDrawerLayoutString toolbartext          mDrawerLayout  DrawerLayout findViewByIdR.id.drawerlayout         mDrawerRelative  RelativeLayout findViewByIdR.id.drawerrelative         if mDrawerLayout  null              findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtna.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnb.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnc.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnd.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtne.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnf.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtng.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnh.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtni.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnj.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnk.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.drawerbtnl.setOnClickListenerthis             findViewByIdR.id.mylayout.setOnClickListenerthis                  Toolbar toolbar  Toolbar findViewByIdR.id.myawesometoolbar             toolbar.setBackgroundgetResources.getDrawableR.drawable.icnactionbarbackground             TextView mTitle  TextView toolbar.findViewByIdR.id.toolbartitle             mTitle.setTexttoolbartext             mTitle.setTypefaceTypeface.DEFAULTBOLD             if toolbar  null                  setSupportActionBartoolbar                  getSupportActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue                          toolbar.setNavigationIconR.drawable.icdrawer               mDrawerToggle  new ActionBarDrawerToggle                     this,  mDrawerLayout, toolbar,                     R.string.draweropen, R.string.drawerclose                                  mDrawerLayout.setDrawerListenermDrawerToggle               toolbar.setNavigationOnClickListenernew OnClickListener                   Override                 public void onClickView v                      if mDrawerLayout.isDrawerOpenGravity.LEFT                          mDrawerLayout.closeDrawerGravity.LEFT                      else                          mDrawerLayout.openDrawerGravity.LEFT                                                                mDrawerLayout.setDrawerShadowR.drawable.drawershadow,                     GravityCompat.START              mDrawerLayout.setScrimColorgetResources.getColor                     android.R.color.transparent             getSupportActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue             getSupportActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue             getSupportActionBar.setDisplayShowTitleEnabledfalse                codepre  pAnd this my code in the fragment..p  pcodeFirstActivity getActivity.initDrawerLayoutmFirst.namecode     where mFirst is a object of class Personp  pand the toolbar code..p  precodeltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar             androidididmyawesometoolbar             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidminHeightattractionBarSizegt            ltTextView                 androidididtoolbartitle                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutgravitycenter                 androidgravitycenter                 androidtextToolbar Title                 androidtextColorcoloractiontextcolor                 androidtextSize18sp                 androidtextStylebold gt               ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbargt codepre  pPlease help guys..p
Negative 100064 pI have C application running on Linux RH 5.3 server that exposes its functionality over web. So I can get some web gui by just typing into web browser something like httprequestedpage The application gets such a request, opens additional TCP session to requesting PC and sends to the browser html page containing some icons and java scripts. My problem is that when the total number of tcp sessions for this process on Linux reaching 1024 any additional web request does not work, it just gets hung. I changed the ulimit n open files to larger number some 16000 and also ulimits max user processes just in case but it does not help. It looks like somewhere the limit of 1024 is applied to this process. I tried to find some limitation logic in the application itself but did not find it. So if anybody has any idea what can cause this please let me know. Thank you. p

Negative 100064 pLet coderelatedcode be a binary predicate.  Let us define a relation subset as the set of all elements such that any element in the subset is related to at least one other element in the subset via related, other than itself hence whether an element is related to itself or not is irrelevant in forming the relation subsets.  Note  a relation subset is NOT necessarily a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStronglyconnectedcomponent relnofollowstrongly connected componenta.  For example, suppose A is related to B, and B and C are related to each other.  Then A,B,C is a relation subset by definition, but is not a strongly connected component because there is no path from B to A or from C to A via related.p  pNote that related is not necessarily symmetric, i.e. relateda,b  true does not necessarily mean that relatedb,a  true, nor is it transitive, i.e. relateda,b  true and relatedb,c  true does not necessarily imply relateda,c  true.  As far as I can see, no restrictions on the binary predicate coderelatedcode need be imposed in order to partition a set into relation subsets.  If an element x is not related to any element at all other than itself, then x is itself its own relation subset.p  pOne good problem is to definep  precodetemplate lttypename Container, typename BinaryPredicategt void partition Containeramp container, BinaryPredicate related codepre  pthat will sort the elements of container so that the container is partitioned into its relation subsets.  This question arose quickly after attempting the original problemp  precodetemplate lttypename Container, typename BinaryPredicategt void removeRelated Containeramp container, BinaryPredicate related codepre  pwhich is to remove from codecontainercode all elements from each relation subset, except for the first one of each subset found in the container.p  pOf course, equality is just a special case of related, and hence this is a generalization of remove all duplicates that is how I thought up this question, by trying to generalize that wellknown solved problem.  What we want is to keep one representative of each relation subset, namely the first one according to the containers ordering of elements.p  pBelow is the code I tried to implement, with the following relationships  p  precodeBob knows Mary Mary knows Jim Jim knows Bob Sally knows Fred Fred knows no one. codepre  pIn this example, A is related to B if and only if A knows B. Bob, Mary, Jim is a relation subset because each person is related to someone else Bob is related to Mary, Mary is related to Jim, Jim is related to Bob. Note that Sally, Fred is NOT a relation subset because though Sally is related to Fred, Fred is not related to Sally. Thus we are left with Sally, Fred as the other two relation subsets.p  pSo the final answer should be  Bob, Sally, Fred.  Note that if the function codepartitioncode were to be defined, then it would simply leave Bob, Mary, Jim, Sally, Fred unchanged, with Bob, Sally, Fred being the first element of each partition.  Hence even if we had the codepartitioncode function not to be confused with stdpartition of course, but Im not really thinking about a good name right now, it is still not immediately clear what coderemoveRelatedcode would need.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltalgorithmgt include ltlistgt include ltsetgt  templatelttypename Container, typename BinaryPredicategt void removeRelated Containeramp container, BinaryPredicate related      using element  typename Containervaluetype     stdsetltelementgt s     for typename Containeriterator it  stdbegincontainer  it  stdendcontainer           if stdfindifs.begin, s.end,                 []const elementamp xgtbool return relatedit,x  s.end             it  container.eraseit   it is related to an element in s.         else              s.insertit             it                 struct Person    Used for testing removeRelated.     stdstring name     stdlistltPersongt peopleKnown     Person const stdstringamp n  namen      void learnsAbout Person p peopleKnown.pushbackp     bool knows Person p const          return stdfindpeopleKnown.begin, peopleKnown.end, p  peopleKnown.end        int main      Person bob  new PersonBob, mary  new PersonMary, jim  new PersonJim,         sally  new PersonSally, fred  new PersonFred     bobgtlearnsAboutmary     marygtlearnsAboutjim     jimgtlearnsAboutbob     sallygtlearnsAboutfred     stdlistltPersongt everybody bob, mary, jim, sally, fred     removeRelated everybody, []Person a, Person bgtbool return agtknowsb     for const Person x  everybody stdcout ltlt xgtname ltlt     Bob Mary Sally Fred   Should be Bob Sally Fred since Bob, Mary, Jim, Sally, Fred are the relation subsets.  codepre  pThe bug from the code above is that Mary is inserted into s because at that point she is not related to anyone in s through knows. In the end, she is related to Jim, who is related to Bob and Bob to Mary through knows, and hence Bob, Mary, Jim is a relation subset, so bob should be the only one of these three people in s.p  pBut during the iteration the function does not know that. How can I fix the algorithm One idea is to perhaps first define the function codepartitioncode mentioned above, i.e. to sort the container so that the container is partitioned into its relation subsets which is a very nice problem in itself, and could very well be the main question at hand, and then simply take the first element of each partition.p  pAnother idea is to replace the lambda functionp  precode[]const elementamp xgtbool return relatedit,x codepre  pwithp  precode[]const elementamp xgtbool return relatedIndirectlyit,x codepre  pand I think it might solve the problem, where the helper function relatedIndirectly searches for a chain of relations to x.p  pHere is another example examined by Cimbali below.  Suppose A is related to B, A is related to C, B is related to C.  Then A,B cannot be a relation subset because B is not related to A. Similarly, A,C and B,C cannot be relation subsets C is not related to A, and C is not related to B, and A,B,C definitely not since C is not related to anyone. A, B, C is the only partitioning that satisfies my definition of relation subsets.p  pConjecture A relation subset is always the union of strongly connected components such that each strongly connected component in the union has at least one element that is related to some element in a different strongly connected component in the union.  But this would need mathematical proof.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive strengthened the above definition of related subset greatly so that BinaryPredicate related shall be reflexive relatedx,x  true for any x, symmetric relatedx,y implies relatedy,x, and transitive relatedx,y and relatedy,z implies relatedx,z.  This partitions any set into equivalence classes.  removeRelated shall remove all elements from every equivalence class except for the first element in the container.  This generalizes the classic problem of remove all duplicates, since equality is a special case of an equivalence relation.  The following code now gives the correct results, but I wonder if there is a way to weaken the condition of related and still get the same results.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltalgorithmgt include ltlistgt include ltsetgt  templatelttypename Container, typename BinaryPredicategt void removeRelated Containeramp container, BinaryPredicate related      using element  typename Containervaluetype     stdsetltelementgt s     for typename Containeriterator it  stdbegincontainer  it  stdendcontainer           if stdfindifs.begin, s.end,                 []const elementamp xgtbool return relatedit,x  s.end             it  container.eraseit   it is related to an element in s.         else              s.insertit             it                  Used for testing removeRelated.

Negative 100064 pIs it possible to find out the state of threads in the threadpool Our application is sometimes using a lot of threads and these are mostly down to calls to ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem. However when the application isnt really doing much the thread count never decreases.

It could be the threads are getting stuck, however when I pause the application in visual studio the threads window only displays around 78 threads. The remote process viewer bundled with v2005 states the process is using in excess of 40 threads.

Negative 100064 pThe full version of this question is quoted belowp  blockquote   pLet G be a connected graph with n vertices, m edges with distinct edge   weights. Let T be a tree of G with n vertices and n1 edges i.e. a   spanning tree, and define a bottleneck edge of T to be the edge of T   with the smallest weight.

Prove   or provide a counter example for the  following statementp      pEvery maxspanning tree of G is a max bottleneck tree of Gp blockquote  pI think since the graph has unique edge weights, then every spanning tree of G is also unique. Then there is only one maximum spanning tree of G, and if I can prove that this tree is also a max bottle neck tree, then that would prove this statement to be true, but only if its true for all graphs that have unique edge weights.p  pIve tried looking for counter examples to prove this false but so far it looks like every graph I draw with unique edge weights winds up have the max spanning tree also be a max bottleneck tree.

Negative 100064 pI have a web app with asp.net mvc 5 on running on iis 7.5. I have a photo upload page that I made with DropZone a javascript ajax upload plugin. In my asp.net controller during certain errors, I return an httpstatuscode of 500 with a status description with a descriptive error. DropZone then displays this descriptive error. Everything works as it should on desktop devices, however when used on an iOS device it displays a generic Internal Server Error message. p  pIm lost at how to troubleshoot this issue. Ive placed javascript alerts throughout my javascript code to try and figure out what the issue is but that didnt reveal anything helpful. Ive tried using the MIHTool ipad app and the HttpWatchBasic ipad app to try and set breakpoints but that was not helpful either. p  pIs there a way to remotely debug an asp.net web app from an iPad I have visual studio 2013 premium Or does anyone have any ideas what may be causing a different status code to be sentp  pstrongUPDATE It appears that iOS devices ignore any custom xhr.statusText and uses the standard default statusText i.e. code 500 is Internal Server Error. As a work around which I hate doing, but since this is primarily for use on company iPads I didnt have much choice Ive returned a different 500 class code for each possible exception and then in the javascript code check the status code and assign my own custom error message in the javascript code.strong p

Negative 100064 pI have a mn connection between the table Bill and the tables GeneralArticles, CalculatedArticles and AdditionalRecords.p  pThese tables are straightforward. Each has its own ID Lets call them BID and for the other ones GAID, CAID and ARID and some additional fields. The question is how to set up one mnconnectiontable between Bill and these three tables guaranteeing referential integrityp  pMy first idea was to simply createp  precodeCREATE TABLE BillArticles [BID] [int] NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Bill BID , [AID] [int] NOT NULL , Category [int] NOT NULL CONSTRAINT [PKBillArticles] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED                           [BID] ASC,             [AID] ASC,             [Category] ASC              codepre  pIve set up a table for the Categories to, so theoretically I could use 1 for General Articles, and so on, you get the idea. Yet the problem is how is it possible to refer to another table depending on the Categoryp  pAnother solution would be to create a View which contains this CategoryID and the ID of the Recordp  precodeCreate View Articles AS Select 1 Category,         GAID AID FROM GeneralArticles UNION  SELECT 2 Category,        CAID AID FROM CalculatedArticles UNION  SELECT 3 Category,         ARID  AID           FROM AdditionalRecords codepre  pUnfortunately when setting up the BillArticles table I get the errorp  blockquote   pForeign key FKBillArAID7526B52E references object Articles   which is not a user table.p blockquote  pSomehow I cant use this kind of View for providing unique keys.p  pDoes anyone know a proper solution for this kind of problem Thank youp

Negative 100064 pI would like to provision an AWS EC2 server using python and set default user and password among other things.

Negative 100064 pI am creating a codePlayercode class for my game, and I need some way to track the controls, but I want to track the keyboard seperately from the player hitboxrendering class. I have code set up to store the value of certain keys kbdWkbd,kbdAkbd,kbdSkbd,kbdDkbd and kbdkbd,kbdkbd,kbdkbd,kbdkbd in variables, in my main class. I want to somehow point to the variables in the constructor and somehow have them tracked.p  pOne way to solve the problem is to replace the variable codewcode with codeplayer2.upcode and so on, so my keyboard tracking methods directly edit the codePlayercode objects, but this isnt as flexible. I could also pass the calling object to the constructor, but this is even less flexible.

Negative 100064 pI ran into the followin issue when running my application on an iPad. The UI elements of my custom first row UITableViewCell were not appearing. Im allocing and positioning these elements manually so the issue is not related to using the wrong xib. Ive uploaded the result of running the exact same code on an a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comBTrsD.png relnofollowiPhone 6a vs an a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com0iDr4.png relnofollowiPad 2a. Notice how the first row cell is empty on the iPad but correctly has the two codeUITextFieldcode elements and the codeUIButtoncode on the iPhone 6p  pAfter some experimentation I know what causes the issue now, but Im at a loss as to why.

Negative 100064 pI am developing a small IDE in Windows Forms. This IDE contains a toolbox from which the controls are dragged and dropped to a panel. When dragged, only a text is transferred telling the panel about what type of user control must be created dynamically at the mouse position. The drag and drop function is working fine. After dragging and dropping the control, the panel will assign codeSelectedObjectcode property of a codePropertyGridcode control with the control that is created. But the problem is that when I change the property in the codePropertyGridcode and try to save the properties in a text file, it saves the default property values, not the changed values.

Then I can very easily translate that into their grid position and identify the clicked square.p  pThe problem is that on any state change Meteor seems to rerender the whole DOM and recall that rendered method for every square. That of course means their data attribute gets way out of whack, since it just keeps iterating. As far as I can tell the solution would seem to be if I could somehow pin those data attributes so the newly rendered dom just keeps them instead of rewriting them. p  pAll I really want to do is change a class on each grid space based on its value in the state array values being rred, bblue etc, but just being used as CSS classes  so if what Im doing is completely insane that would also be really helpful feedback Im really having trouble figuring out how I should be identifying which  is clicked though if not like this.p  pThanks in advance for any help, and if I can provide any clarification Id be happy to.p

In other words, it should only output that one AID which has the mode number in the AID stack within the ETRANSACTION table which basically displays the transactions made by that agent.p  pIve tried ORDER BY and GROUP BY by themselves, and Ive even tried them together, but I havent gotten any results.p  pI tried joining the two tables ETRANSACTION and AGENT to get the name to come up as well as the AID which the name is fixed with, but that didnt work out either.

I will have to change that in my requirements list. The way I have my code set up now is that there is NO more than one ESTATE per TRANSACTION. So, that means there will only be ONE Agent making that TRANSACTION which gets someone ASSIGNED an ESTATE. So, each ESTATE has one solely unique TRANSACTION ID as well as the AGENT who made the transaction. An agent is allowed to sell up to 5 estates, but those estates only get assigned one transaction ID.p  pI presented a few lines of dummydata that has already been implemented in my database.

Or it should look like codehttpsupersite.comapiarticles42code   pli lipHow should codeJSONcode response structure look like. The problem here is that content of static pages is quite different, for instance codeContact Uscode page will have such important information phone numbers, emails and can be independent properties in codeJSONcode response. codeAbout Uscode page have another main parts. And there can be a lot of such pages. How to keep this unified       pli lipMaybe it is better to unify JSON responses just into serveral properties short description, full text, image ... and send raw text or even html and do work on a client. But it seems not to be a good idea.pli ol  pMaybe there is another correct way to implement this. Or it is not be part API at all and should be done in another way.     p  pI would be grateful for everyone, thanks for help in advance.p
Negative 100064 pIm tilting a cube by dragging it with the mouse. That means I need to RotateAround its edges.p  pRotateAround takes a point to rotate around, a rotate vector and the angle to rotate. The angle is relative. That means, if I already rotated by 10 degrees and do it again it will be rotated by 20 degrees.p  pWhat I however want is a way to state the angle in an absolute way. That mean, if I rotate by 10 degrees and do it again it will still be 10 degrees.p  pIs there a way to achieve this without tracking the tiltprogress myselfp

Negative 100064 pOkay i am new to angular, just started working with ngRoute and ngView directives, i have come across something that is an issue for me but i suspect is only an issue due to my lack of expereince in angluar.p  pI have the following markupsimplified on my index.html pagep  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtSample APPlttitlegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv classheadergt       ltnav classpullrightgt...ltnavgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classmain ngviewgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classfootergt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe above is the default layout structure that my page uses.

Like thisp  precodeltdiv classheadergt   ltnav classpullrightgt...ltnavgt   ltdiv classslidergt...ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNow this is for the homepage only so im totally confused about how to implement this.

Negative 100064 pIm working on a project in C that uses Principal Component Analysis to apply feature reductiondimension reduction on a [,]matrix. The matrix columns are features words and bigrams that have been extracted from a set emails. In the beginning we had around 156 emails which resulted in approximately 23000 terms and everything worked as it was supposed to using the following codep  precodepublic static double[,] GetPCAComponentsdouble[,] sourceMatrix, int dimensions  20, AnalysisMethod method  AnalysisMethod.Center        Create Principal Component Analysis of a given source     PrincipalComponentAnalysis pca  new PrincipalComponentAnalysissourceMatrix, method       Compute the Principal Component Analysis     pca.Compute       Creates a projection of the information     double[,] pcaComponents  pca.TransformsourceMatrix, dimensions       Return PCA Components     return pcaComponents  codepre  pThe components we received were classified later on using Linear Discriminant Analysis Classify method from the Accord.NET framework. Everything was working as it should.p  pNow that we have increased the size of out dataset 1519 emails and 68375 terms we at first were getting some OutOfMemory Exceptions. We were able to solve this by adjusting some parts of our code until we were able to reach the part where we calculate the PCA components. Right now this takes about 45 minutes which is way too long. After checking a hrefhttpaccordframework.netdocshtmlTAccordStatisticsAnalysisPrincipalComponentAnalysis.htm relnofollowthe website of Accord.NET on PCAa we decided to try and use the last example that uses a covariance matrix since it says Some users would like to analyze huge amounts of data. In this case, computing the SVD directly on the data could result in memory exceptions or excessive computing times. Therefore we changed our code to the followingp  precodepublic static double[,] GetPCAComponentsdouble[,] sourceMatrix, int dimensions  20, AnalysisMethod method  AnalysisMethod.Center                Compute mean vector         double[] mean  Accord.Statistics.Tools.MeansourceMatrix           Compute Covariance matrix         double[,] covariance  Accord.Statistics.Tools.CovariancesourceMatrix, mean           Create analysis using the covariance matrix         var pca  PrincipalComponentAnalysis.FromCovarianceMatrixmean, covariance           Compute the Principal Component Analysis         pca.Compute           Creates a projection of the information         double[,] pcaComponents  pca.TransformsourceMatrix, dimensions           Return PCA Components         return pcaComponents      codepre  pThis however raises an System.OutOfMemoryException. Does anyone know how to solve this problemp

Negative 100064 pI have a concern regarding, how java compare the String and how optimized it is.p  pLets consider I require to compare user provided String, with 10 Strings in my code. Out of those 10 Strings 5 are starting with A and other 5 are starting with B.p  pNow if I write codeif..elseif..code or codeswitchcode, then each string will be compared until it matches with any String, and under worst case scenario, where either String is getting matched in 9th or 10th condition or not at all. So average 8 to 10 conditions are executing for each input.p  pNow my question is can we optimize this situation by putting one more condition kind of filter before checking the input string with actual value. Like below,p  precode   ifinputString.charAt0  A             if                 ....             else if                 ....                      else ifinputString.charAt0  B             if                 ...             else if                 ...                       codepre  pCan it improve the performance of the system or Java is already internally optimized for this kind of situation. p

Negative 100064 pIm writing unit tests for Django projects using unittest and mock.p  pEvertyhing looks ok, but the problem appears with a large number of patches for each model being used in the action. Im usually creating around 10 tests for each method under the test to be able to verify all its flows. This means that multiple tests will have the same mocked methods with small changes. Instead of creating patches for each method separately Ive created codesetUpClasscode method to define patches once for all the tests, like thisp  precodeclassmethod def setUpClasscls      Patching models to remove calls to DB     patchedmodels  actions [Model1, Model2, Model3]     cls.patchers  []     for location in patchedmodels         for model in patchedmodels[location]             patcher  patchapplication.0..formatlocation  model, spec  evalmodel             cls.patchers.appendpatcher             modelmock  patcher.start             modelmock.objects  mock.Mock             modelmock.objects.get  getattrcls, get  model.lower, None             modelmock.objects.filter  getattrcls, filter  model.lower, None  classmethod def tearDownClasscls     for patcher in cls.patchers         patcher.stop codepre  pThis allows me to create methods like p  precodeclassmethod def getmodel1cls, kwargs     return mock.MocknameModel1 codepre  pNow, whenever in code under test I have something like codeModel1.objects.getpk  request.idcode Im receiving response from my function. This part looks good. The problem occurs whenever I try to change some parameters of the mock that is being returned inside codedef getmodel1code. Lets say I want in 5 tests from 10 I need to return mock with name equals codeModel1code and in remaining 5 tests with the same function I want to return mock that has name codeModel1.1code.p  pThe idea that I got was to have somewhere default parameter defined that will be reset before each test execution, like thisp  precodedef setUpself      Setting default value     self.class.modelname  Model1 codepre  pAnd getter function will transform in something like thisp  precodeclassmethod def getmodel1cls, kwargs     return mock.Mockname  cls.modelname codepre  pHaving this, will always return us mock with the default name. And now, if in some test I need different name I will do something like thisp  precodedef testanothernameself     self.class.modelname  Model1.1      Execute some code with a new name codepre  pSomehow, this code doesnt work and Im still receiving each time the Mock with default value.p  pDo you know why do I always receive default values or maybe you could suggest better way of doing the same thing with default values instead of defining each value explicitly inside each testp

Negative 100064 pIm developing a service that monitors computers. Computers can be added to or removed from monitoring by a web GUI. I keep reported data basically in various maps like codeMapltComputer, Temperaturegtcode. Now that the collected data grows and the data structures become more sophisticated including computers referencing each other I need a concept for what happens when removing computers from monitoring. Basically I need to delete all data reported by the removed computer. The most a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKISSprincipleKISSalike approach would be removing the data manually from memory, likep  precodepublic void onRemoveComputer computer      temperatures.removecomputer      ...  codepre  pThis method had to be changed whenever I add features  I know Java has a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavautilWeakHashMap.htmlcodeWeakHashMapcodea, so I could store reported data like sop  precode MapltComputer, Temperaturegt temperatures  new WeakHashMapltgt codepre  pI could call a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangSystem.htmlgccodeSystem.gccodea whenever a computer is removed from monitoring in order have all associated data eagerly removed from these maps.p  pWhile the first approach seems a bit like primitive MyISAM tables, the second one resembles a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.7eninnodbforeignkeyconstraints.htmlDELETE cascades in InnoDB tablesa.

Negative 100064 pWe have an application that takes XML and turns it into Nodes based on a custom style sheet. It is then loaded to some database.

An codeltAgtcode tag may become codeltEgtcode one time but become codeltFgtcode in another example. Furthermore, reprocessing on the same XML produces proper results. Additionally, content of tags remain the same. We have seen this issue roughly 1 out of 1,000,000 times weve processed.p  pThis application is multithreaded, which we believe may be causing some of these issues. Transformers are not listed as thread safe. However, this same process has been running for a long time without issue. The only difference at this time appears to be load. p  pWe are mainly trying to determine whether the transformer may be at fault, or if it will be helpful to look elsewhere. We have tried scouring multiple resources to see if someone else has had a similar problem but we havent had much luck.p
Negative 100064 pI have a problem that has been bugging me a whole week and I have come to a dead end.p  pThis is the scenario I have a method in a Java Spring Controller that handles a HTTP POST request. The POST request contains a picture. The twist is that the picture is not sent as multipart request, it is sent in the RequestBody note for the answers saying to change the way of sending the picture I have no access or possibility of doing this, I have to do with what I have. p  pSo i extract the picture by using the input stream from the request. Then I open an Output stream and then write to the file, while I am reading from the input stream.p  precodeInputStream is   request.getInputStream OutputStream os  new FileOutputStreamnew FileDM  request.getHeaderContentLocation.toString int x   while x  is.read  1      os.writex     os.flush   os.close codepre  pNothing fancy, just plain old write as you read, byte by byte.p  pThe problem is that the picture is shown as jpeg as to be expected, but you can not open it I have tried multiple viewers and got the same resultp  blockquote   pnameofpic.jpg Decode error Not a JPEG file Starts with 0xbd 0xefp blockquote  pThen I said okay lets try another way or output stream for writing the picture.

Negative 100064 pMy understanding is that Android instrumented JUnit tests run on their own thread unless annotated with codeUiThreadcode or calling a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappInstrumentation.htmlrunOnMainSyncjava.lang.Runnable relnofollowcodeInstrumentation.runOnMainSynccodea or a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActivity.htmlrunOnUiThreadjava.lang.Runnable relnofollowcodeActivity.runOnUiThreadcodea. Now Im trying to use a codeCursorLoadercode to access my apps database and populate a codeListViewcode. I also have a test which verifies that the codeListViewcode is populated correctly.p  pMy problem is that I need to synchronize three threads the test thread should wait until the codeCursorLoadercode thread finishes and notifies the UI thread to populate the codeListViewcode. To create a codeCursorLoadercode, I register a codeLoaderCallbackscode with the support codeLoaderManagercode and create the instance in codeonCreateLoadercode. Then codeonLoadFinishedcode changes the cursor of the codeListViewcodes adapter.p  pNow I need to ensure that my test waits until codeonLoadFinishcode has been called before attempting to access the child views of the codeListViewcode. My current idea is to add a codewaitForDatacode method to my codeLoaderCallbackscode implementation which the tests can call. However, Im not sure how to implement this method. Can I simply use a codewaitcode and then codenotifyAllcode in codeonLoadFinishedcode Or do I need to use something more sophisticated like a codeSemaphorecodep
Negative 100064 pI have been trying to get my mongodb going for about a day now. The problem seems to be that the mongod command is not found. I have the npm package mongoose installed in my node.js build. When i try to start the server with the mongod command the git bash returns that the command is not found. p  pI have been googleing for an answer and it looks like i need to make mongodb into a command, im not sure how to do this. Any advice would help.p  pI have downloaded the mongodb into my files its located here CProgram FilesMongoDBServer3.0  Not sure if that matters or not.p  pReally not sure what to do from here.p

Negative 100064 pIm fairly new to android and Im attempting to create an app to spoof the MAC address of my device.

But now when I try to connect to wifi by doingp  precodewifiManager  WifiManager this.getSystemServiceContext.WIFISERVICE          wifiManager.setWifiEnabledtrue codepre  pnothing is happening.

Negative 100064 hr  h2strongShort versionstrong is it a good idea to use multiple processes and memory sharing POSIX to divide the development in a functional wayh2  pstrongLong versionstrong For my college project, we proposed basically a GPS for indoors in this case a warehouse and the forklifts as users. The idea is to handle the Realtime streams from 3 ip cameras RTSP attached to the roof directed to the floor, process them and push the position of each forklift into a DB and a simple webpage to see the magic.p  pRight now we are looking the best way to tackle this problem and use a functional approach to divide the tasks e.g. one guy writes the background remover, other guy the features extractor, other guy the position and velocity vector estimator, motion blur filter, kalman, etc and at the end get to work together these highly specialized blocks.p  pWe plan to use OpenCV since the performance is much better than Matlabs toolkits and it offers CUDA, TBB in case we need a boost. Our main concern is the realtime compromise and to divide the development in a smart way, so I proposed a main process that handles the stream and via shared memory to feed the different blocks since many of the core operations are independent of each other this can be with POSIX or System V functions. The best thing of this approach is that each person can develop his part independently, test perfomance and at the end add the extension to the main process. So far the experiments with the streaming and allocate OpenCV objects in shared memory have been successful.p  pDoes this makes sense to you guys Do you know a smarter way to divide and conquer am I reinventing the wheelp  pThank you very much for your time.

Negative 100064 pI created a small application that generates reports mainly PDFs from an sqlite3 database exported from GNUCash. I separated the app with a possibility of sharing it with other VFW posts that are currently using GNUCash or stuck with a paper general ledger. I call it a quasi API in that most reports can be generated in both HTML and PDF or it can just send data. Before I separated it, I had tried a multiple database approach, adding the sqlite3 database to my database.yaml along with my main postgresql database. It worked but that made the possibility of sharing difficult and I was a little skeptical about the approach.  p  pAll is fine with PDFs prawn generated. I use RestClient to get the reports from the pdf server running on the same machine on a different port. For example, to generate a General Ledger this controller get action is calledp  precodedef ledgerpdf   resp  RestClient.get httplocalhost8600ledgersparams[id]ledgerpdf   senddata resp.body, filename Ledgerparams[id],     type applicationpdf,     disposition inline end codepre  pOn the pdf server, this action respondsp  precodedef ledgerpdf   pdf  PdfLedger.newviewcontext,params   senddata pdf.render, filename Ledgerparams[id],     type applicationpdf,     disposition inline end codepre  pGetting the HTML version became a little more challenging On the pdf server I have a one page menu that lists all the reports available, some by date and others with a collection route. This was for the sharing version where someone only needs the reports and does not have another rails application that does other stuff. The server could be stand alone running on some box.p  pRather then getting the data and creating a page on the main application from the data, I got the menu from the pdf server in an iframe tag. I though this was working great when I discovered that, in a viewp  precodeltiframe srchttplocalhost8600ledgers width100 height100 idrailsiframegterrorltiframegt codepre  pwas calling codelocalhost8600code on my machine which was running a development version and fooled me into thinking it was working rather than on the production server. After some researching I discovered that you cant do that. I guess the RestClient call to codelocalhost8600code is hidden from the browser, but the iframe call is not.p  pI guess I can get the HTML versions using the same RestClient approach and return texthtml and use nokogiri to get the bodyhtml and codeyieldcode it somehow, if I knew how to do that. p  pThe html.slim is really simple and I could just duplicate it on my main server after getting the data, but then Id have two code bases to maintain.p  pAnother approach would be to make it a real API and make it public so that the iframe approach would work, something I was trying to avoid authentication and all that.p  pI guess my question is, does someone have another approach or can refine or give me pointers on my approaches.p

Negative 100064 pIve posted this comment twice on Vittorios blog about this here a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combvbertocciarchive20150813adal3didntreturnrefreshtokensfor5monthsandnobodynoticed.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combvbertocciarchive20150813adal3didntreturnrefreshtokensfor5monthsandnobodynoticed.aspxa, but it never shows up in the comments so Im adding it here.p  pWe have one specific scenario where we use RT that are in the context of a Windows service where there isnt an interactive user, the session information can start and stop unexpectedly, and it isnt feasible to develop a distributable custom ADAL caching mechanism.  RT are the logical choice, which seems to be the type of scenario you see described in the other comments here.  ADAL doesnt address this well today, RT do, and I havent seen any business justification for removing them  only for keeping them.  Removing RT would adversely impact about 100 of our customers using this solution.  If you have another workable solution in ADAL were happy to use it, but if not then removing RT for some kind of protocol purist reason will be a big problem.p

Negative 100064 pSuppose I have a large campsite like seating chart with several hundred lots sectioned off and outlined in photoshop. each lot is roughly a square Every lot needs to be numbered in photoshop and also editable in the future in case of changes. The lots are scattered and curve around the landscape so entering text in one layer seems out since for example lot 27 with be on the right and rotate 20 degrees to match the lot and yet lot 185 might be way over on the left at a far different angle.p  pIs there an elegant way to do this or at least quickly import a large number sequence that places one number per layer so I can grab them and orient them to their corresponding lot quickly instead of typing out and then positioning ever number individually Im having trouble thinking up an elegantfast way to handle this in Photoshop...p  hr  pstrongEdit 1 strong picture a hrefhttpi.imgur.comUT3DRBi.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comUT3DRBi.jpgap
Negative 100064 pIm using the EA12 1215 document generator API to create some documentation. Ive a situation where is would be very useful to replace the field value for one or two fields within a template in a particular situation, so Ive tried the followingp  precodegenerationSuccess  docGenerator.DocumentElement connectedElement.ElementID, level, PROCESSTEMPLATE  if  generationSuccess      ReportWarning Error generating process documentation   docGenerator.GetLastError  generationSuccess  docGenerator.ReplaceFieldElement.Name, Method   method.Name  if  generationSuccess      ReportWarning Error replacing field   docGenerator.GetLastError  codepre  pHowever, it doesnt seem to replace the field, or give any error.p  pI dont understand the scope of the codeReplaceFieldcode method, since wherever I put it, it either breaks the document, or does nothing.p  pThe only reason I could think of for this not doing anything, is that the template calls fragments in which the codeElement.Namecode field was referenced, but having converted the fragment to a template and called it explicitly, codeReplaceFieldcode still seems to do nothing.p  pDoes anyone have a good example piece of script that uses codeReplaceFieldcode effectively with element data fields p  pThe codeACMEContextDocumentGeneratorcode example Ive found so far only uses codeReplaceFieldcode on a single document level custom data field, which is not what Im trying to do.p  pAny pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, since Ive tried everything I can think of.p

In case Triple buffering was working fine for each frame that gets queued from TimedEventQueueOnVideoEvent, the buffer that should get dequeued should be 2 slots behind. For Ex if we queue buf 4 then buf 2 should be dequeued but whats is getting dequeued is immediate previous buffer which surfaceflinger only releases when it gets the chance to run the next time. Hence the delay and whichin turn causes cancelbuffers for video to catch up.pli lipSurfaceFlinger itself taking some time to finish. pli lipVsync not getting turned on at appropriate times say every 33ms for a 30 fps video. An Issue with vsync generation logic in HWComposer or vsync not being enabled by eventControl due to no actual buffers being Queuedpli ol  pUpdating from the below comment that I made Other things that I have noted is that async and mDequeueBufferCannotBlock flags are both false and hence getMinUndequeuedBufferCount returns 1 and thus we see the immediate previous buffer being asked for dequeue rather than a buffer 2 slots behind. PLease let me know if there is hole in above understanding. And anything that i can do to get around thisp  pAny help is greatly appreciated. p
