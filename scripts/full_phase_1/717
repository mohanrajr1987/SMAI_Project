Positive 717 pSo Im trying to complete a mergesort for an array of strings, but I really have some troubles when it comes to C. In the following code Im trying to mergesort an array of words that were scrambled by another program. However whenever I look up information on mergesort all of them seem to have integers as arguments for their mergesort, where as ours is using string first, and string last for its arguments.

Positive 717 pI have two branches Branch develop is the branch from which nightly builds are made. So it should contain more or less working code.

Positive 717 pUPDATEDp  pI encountered a problem while trying to perform a simple table merging task in R. Im looking for why this happened and, if it exists, a more elegant solution. Below is the exact data Im working with and what happened. p  pI have two tables from a survey related to how different political parties and business people think about a political issue. They come from two different datasets, which I dont want to merge for various reasons. Each data has the exact same names for values. But, when I used codecbindcode to merge the columns, the rows get reverse for some columns and I cant figure out why. p  pMy datap  precodelibrarysurvey founders.services lt  structurec38, 43, 131, 172, 177, 122, 34, 12, 114, 70, 17,  27, .Dim  c2L, 6L, .Dimnames  structurelistservices  ccompete,  similar, party  cskipped, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian,  Republican, other, .Names  cservices, party  public.services.party lt  structurec26, 103, .Dim  2L, .Dimnames  structurelistservices  csimilar,  compete, .Names  services, class  csvytable, xtabs,  table, call  svytable.survey.designformula  services,      design  fss codepre  pAnd, how I combine themp  precodecbindfounders.services, public.services.party codepre  pIn the first and correct table, under the column libertarian, the row compete has the value of 34 and similar has 12. But, in the combined table with cbind, its the reverse. If the names were different, they should show up as different columns. But, cbind seems to recognize that they are both the same values. p  pWhy is this happeningp  pAnd, more generally, if theres a better way to combine tables, Im happy to consider alternatives. Basically what I have is a few different data sets where various populations political party, business type answered the same questions.

Positive 717 pIm working with Unity 5 and the Smart Merge tool a tool that helps you to merge files that would otherwise be hard to merge. For this tool to work, you have to change a setting in Unity that will ensure that those files are serialised as text, rather than being binary. This is fine, and Ive turned that on in the two branches that I want to merge and now all those assets are serialised as text.p  pHowever, when I go to merge, I get errors when the Smart Merge tool tries to look at the base versions of those files. These versions of the files are from the common ancestor of the branches Im trying to merge. Of course, since I only turned on the text serialisation recently for merging, the files from the common ancestor are binary and the merge tool cant handle them.p  pIs there any way I can work around this I thought maybe this would be possible through git, so I posted here instead of on the gamedev StackExchange site. p

Positive 717 pemHi all,em I faced with a problem that Formula is not executed in merged entity. So I have Entity with one property marked with Formula annotation. When I execute select of entity, the annotated property contains a proper value, but after merge returned persisted entity, the property is always null. Is it possible to trigger execution of the Formula after merge Thanks in advance.p

My question is, Is there any way to unmerge those files being merged together into separate files  An example. I am give a pdf file with 10 pages which I dont know sub pdf parts. Is there any tool to analyze meta data and tells me the pdf file is a merge of subfiles from page 15, and 610p

Positive 717 pAfter merging two unequal time series I want to fill the blanks with a custom function. Lets say my Series1 is daily data and Series2 is monthly data. So now Series1 has for example 30 data points for one month and Series2 only one. If I make a left join Series 2 has 29 NAs which I dont like. Ideally I would like a fill function so that Series 2 takes always the previous value to fill these 29 days.p  pSo for example if the 31. of January has a value of 10 and the 28th of February a value of 15, February 127. should have a value of 10 as well. Of course in the beginning this doesnt work since the first row is probably also a NA, so the first row should take the value of the first row containing a value at all.p  pAt the moment I have this, but still, all NAs are presentp  precodeTestltmerge.xtsSeries1, Series2, joinleft, fillfunctionx x[indexx1,] codepre  pSeries1p  precodestructurec1.51762156049755, 1.52103159497526, 1.51401262063846,

Positive 717 pI have a project that is up on GitHub.  Locally I am using Perforce and git p4 to push commits to GitHub.

Positive 717 pThe a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodel relnofollowgit flow modela works really well for a lot of small developmental branches.

Under each of these columns are groups of tires that corresponds to dates that bicycle rides occurred.p  pThe shop gets returned tires which were removed.  Those returns are logged in the returns table Table B below with the following information   Name, Tire Group A, B, or C, Return Date, and Serial Number.p  pGOAL match each returned Serial Number from the shop returns table Table B below to a tire that was installed on a Tricycle being monitored by sensors.  p  pBasic assumption a returned tire was installed on the 1st group before recorded return date.  As an examble, Serial Number 1132 below was installed on Tire B group 1 on Hot.  This is because 1132 was received at the shop between group 2s first ride 5501 1502 and group 2s last ride 71602 421.  Therefore, when this condition is true, the tire group is group 2  1  group 1.p  pSerial number 6846 was installed on Tire B group 2 on Hot.  See Table C for an example of results I need to be able to join to either table.p  pI can do this using for loops and ifthen statements, however in Python this is very time consuming when analyzing millions of datapoints.

Positive 717 pIm familiar with ClearCase where we can merge a file to a branch from any other branch. How is this possible in git For eg, I have the following structurep  precodemastergtbranch2         V branch1 codepre  pSo there is some independent development going in codebranch1code and codebranch2code. I want to merge some specific code from codebranch2code to codebranch1code using some mergetool like kdiff3. p  pEDIT Kdiff3 has an awesome merging option by comparing 2 or 3 versions of the file from same or different branch, highlighting the conflicts. Then we can jump through each conflict, and pick the code from 1 or more versions of the file, make some edits if necessary and finally save the file. This feature has been quite handy for me when I worked with ClearCase. Is there a way to configure git mergetool with kdiff3 to work the same way p  pThanks in advancep

So, each object member field would connect out to the reception connector on the object of the members type.  In and of itself those objects are fairly easy to build.  The problem I ran into is that the connector lines didnt respect the objects and ran over the top of them, making an awful, unusable mess.p  pThanks for any pointers.p

Negative 717 pI have created a raw socket which takes all IPv4 packets from data link layer with data link layer header removed. And for reading the packets I use coderecvfromcode.p  pMy doubt is Suppose due to some scheduling done by OS, my process was asleep for 1 sec. When it woke up,it did coderecvfromcode with number of bytes to be received say 1000 on this raw socket with the intention of receiving strongonly onestrong IPv4 packet and say the size of this packet is 380 bytes. And suppose many network applications were also running simultaneously during this time, so all IPv4 packets must have been queued in the receive buffer of this socket. So now coderecvfromcode will return all 1000 bytes with other IPv4 packets from 381th byte onwards bcoz it has enough data in its buffer to return. Although my program was meant to understand only one IPv4 packetp  pSo how to prevent this thing Should I read byte by byte and parse each byte but it is very inefficient.p

Negative 717 pI have a C library that I build using Scons which is eventually linked into among other things a Python extension.p  pOnce I have built the library with scons, I have written a standard setup.py script which I call to build and install the extension.p  pMy main problem is that setup.py does not recognize when the library has been rebuilt only when the extensions code has been changed, so every time I rebuild the library, I have to clean the extension before building it again.  Also, if I change the directory structure, I would prefer to only need to edit the Scons files.  And finally, its just slightly more convenient to need only call scons instead of having to call scons in addition to setup.py.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to integrate distutils into Scons so that it can take advantage of the knowledge Scons has about which files need to be rebuiltp

Negative 717 pIve developing an ASP.NET application that interfaces with Google Maps and retrieves marker information from a database. The marker information is split into tables in the database, where the name of the table reflects a company e.g. CompanyAMarkerData, CompanyBMarkerData etc. In order to periodically update the map with new marker data, I use setTimeout in JavaScript to regularly call my UpdateMarkers JavaScript function. UpdateMarkers makes a call to a web service which performs the database query and returns a list of markers back to the JavaScript, which in turn updates the map. p  pThe main issue I have with this method is that my web service requires that I pass it the name of the company so that it knows which table in the database to access. As you can imagine , this poses a security risk as anyone can pass a different company name to the web service and be able to retrieve the data from other companies, as well as their own.p  pIn order to avoid this problem, I am restructuring my program as follows When the system administrator creates users for my application, they can also assign a company ID to this user. The company ID is stored using the Profile object in ASP.NET. I am moving the web service code into a class with shared functions so that they can be called only within my pages but not by anyone, like with web services. The functions will still require a company name passed to be passed to them. However, rather than the JavaScript making direct calls to these shared functions, the JavaScript will call a set of page methods which as I understand it, are not public like web services. These page methods will then use the Profile object to retrieve the company name attached to the user currently logged in and then make a call to my shared database functions and return the info back to the JavaScript.p  pI think that this second method is more secure than the first, because I dont allow the client to pass different options to my code and retrieve unauthorized data. The server side code works out the parameters that need to be sent. However, I am wondering if there is a better way of doing this that I am missing outp  pThanksp  pAmrp

Negative 717 pstrongThe backgroundstrongbr Currently, I try to get a zipfile through a HTTPservlet with a HTTPrequest. The received zipfile contains three different files. These files contain information I want to filter out and doing this from the source is not an option thats just how it is, though I am aware it would be much better.  p  pBecause I cant filter out some information in the file from the source, where the file is build from the beginning, my solution is to decompress the file, read these three files as strings and then filter them.

Negative 717 pI have a fairly simple iPhone application that I want to have run on both the iPhone and the iPad. Id like to just have the iPad version be a bigger version of the iPhone version, scaled up or not  Im working on an iPadspecific version of the app that makes better use of the interface, but wanted to make sure my existing customers have something in the meantime.p  pThe app is a simple tabbased application, and within each tab is a navigation controller that presents a table view, each of which can drill down a couple of layers. Everything mostly works  I have a couple of instances of views not filling the space available, but I can fix that. My biggest problem right now is that the navigation controllers universally break when I try using them. Once I drill down a level or two, I suddenly wont be able to come back up again.p  pLet me try to explain in more detailp  pOne tab starts off with a year table view, showing all years that have entries if you tap a year, it pushes another table view with all months in that year that have entries if you tap a month, it pushes another table view that shows the individual entries if you tap an entry, it pushes a view a codeUIWebViewcode, with some extra widgets that shows an entrys details.p  pEach push is done with code[self.navigationController pushViewController foo animated YES]code. The three table view controllers I mentioned above are all created from the same nib in fact, emeverythingem pushed onto a navigation controller in any tab is loaded from the same nib. Since I know there are only up to three levels of navigation, I just allocated three identical view controllers and use one, two, or three depending on how many entries there are.p  pPopping these controllers off using the back button seems to universally mess up the state of the view controller. So, if I drill down to the third view  showing everything in a single month  I wont be able to pop all the way back up to the first view the back button stops working if I pop up one level.p  pAnother example in another tab its one table view that you can tap any entry on, and a new view controller will be pushed that shows the details of that entry. If I tap an entry, tap the back button, then tap the entry again, emno back button appears,em or sometimes, the emtextem that would go inside the back button appears, but no button appearsp  pThis behavior happens if I try running the iPhone app in scaled mode built with base SDK 4.0, supporting OS 3.2 or in native mode built with base SDK 3.2. It runs without problems on the iPhone. Im kind of at a loss here, because this stuff always just worked out of the box, mostly from the defaults that were set up back when I first created the project.p  pMy programmers instincts are telling me that Im doing something very wrong in my view navigation, and that the iPad is just exposing it, but I cant figure out what it is.p  pHas anyone run into an issue like this, or suggest something it might be or some better way to debug whats going onp

Negative 717 pI have read a number of questions on this site about this issue, I understand the followingp  pself.property accesses the gettersetter method created manually or by synthesize. Depending upon whether the property is declared as retain, copy etc. the retain count is modified correctly, for example a retained property, releases the previous value assigned the new value with retain and increments the retain count by 1. p  pProperties are usually declared with instance variables of the same name can be different if you make the assignment manually. This is generally because the synthesize generated accessors use the instance variable to reference the object in memory and then perform the relevant commands. p  pMy question is based on the fact that in many examples, self.property and property are used interchangeably for different things and Im having troubles determining the rules. One example in the Recipes example app in the Apple Docs, has the followingp  precodeself.navigationItem.title  recipe.name nameTextField.text  recipe.name     overviewTextField.text  recipe.overview     prepTimeTextField.text  recipe.prepTime  codepre  pand...p  precodeself.ingredients  sortedIngredients codepre  pEach of these properties have associated private instance variables of the same name.

Negative 717 pApologies for what could be a basic architecture question p  pWe implement our business logic layer using wcf services. They connect to a mysqldb which is the database layer and do some processing. The wcf services can be consumed by multiple applications. p  pBasic question  If we are planning to do some horizontal sharding or some form of partitioning where do I put the shard manager E.g, Instead of a single db now I will have two dbs in two machines. p  pstrongThe call to get a particular item may go to db1 or db2 depending on say the primary key of the item record.strong p  pIn this scenario, would I need to deploy multiple copies of my WCF code each with a different connectionstring and then have a layer before that which does some resolution as to which service URL to call I am sure that there are patterns for this sort of a problem and it would be great if I could get some pointers in the right direction. p

Negative 717 pIm new to StackOverflow, and also new to objectivec. p  pI have tried looking for a couple weeks now to find something that gives me a hint of what to do, but I cant seem to get through this one without asking a question. It feels like it should be simple, but... p  pIm having a problem with the rotation of a rootView controller. It should show up in landscape which it did, before I decided to use a navigation controller. The simulator shows up in the correct orientation, but it has loaded the view rotated 90 degress left, so that the text reads from bottom to top, sideways, so you have to cock your head left. The leftmost portion of the view is visible, but the remainder of the view runs off the top of the screen. Its a large program Im finding that, in general, with objectivec, but enjoying it nonetheless..., but heres the gist of what I think are the important code areasp  pIn the appDelegate, I create a window, my rootViewcontroller, and the navcontrollerp  precode .h file UIWindow window wordHelper3ViewController viewController UINavigationController navigationController codepre  pThen in the implementationp  precode.m file  BOOLapplicationUIApplication applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions           Hide status bar     application.statusBarHidden  YES           Add the view controllers view to the window and display.

So now, on to InterfaceBuilderp  pIn the attributes inspector for both the rootView and the navigation controller, the orientation is set to landscape. For the rootView, under referencing outlets, the view is set to files owner. I also have an action attached to the view touchUpInside  I changed its class to UIButton, because I wanted to resignFirstResponder when the user clicks anywhere in the background. p  pFor the navigationController, under Referencing outlets, it shows a connection from the navigationController to my appDelegate. p  pIn the main window xib, the nav contoller shows up in the list, and the view controller shows up as a subview of it. p  pThe viewcontroller also shows up on its own, in the main windows list of objects.p  pThe only thing that stands out to me, is that when I double click the window object, IT comes up visually in portrait mode. p  pDoes anyone have any ideasp

I am simply missing some basics here. Any help would be greatly. Once I have learned enough I may well start answering other newbie questions on this subject.p

Negative 717 pI have a couple questions regarding the relationship between references between two aggregate roots in a DDD model. Refer to the typical CustomerOrder model diagrammed below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUvsdK.png altenter image description herep  pFirst, should references between the actual object implementation of aggregates always be done through ID values and not object references For example  if I want details on the customer of an Order I would need to take the CustomerId and pass it to a ICustomerRepository to get a Customer rather then setting up the Order object to return a Customer directly correct Im confused because returning a Customer directly seems like it would make writing code against the model easier, and is not much harder to setup if I am using an ORM like NHibernate. Yet Im fairly certain this would be violating the boundaries between aggregate rootsrepositories.p  pSecond, where and how should a cascade on delete relationship be enforced for two aggregate roots For example say I want all the associated orders to be deleted when a customer is deleted. The ICustomerRepository.DeleteCustomer method should not be referencing the IOrderRepostiory should it That seems like that would be breaking the boundaries between the aggregatesrepositories Should I instead have a CustomerManagment service which handles deleting Customers and their associated Orders which would references both a IOrderRepository and ICustomerRepository In that case how can I be sure that people know to use the Service and not the repository to delete Customers. Is that just down to educating them on how to use the model correctlyp

Negative 717 pI am using trying to develop a program in Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7. I finally got it to run, although it is a bit temperamental sometimes it runs smoothly and sometimes it doesnt.  I have realized that there is no way for it to run without enabling speech recognition, which I turn on before I debug it, although I have found that the background functions of speech recognition interfere with the execution of my code. It starts trying to insert words into my code, which interrupts it and so on. Is there a way to suppress these background functions so that the speech recognition SR is focused solely on running my codep  pI think the general idea is to find a configuration that will help it run smoothly consistently...p
Negative 717 pWhat I mean by this is something a bit like the stackoverflow markup editor type markup with realtime rendering but in a single element, as opposed to having a second window. p  pThis would let the user type [[blahblah]] and the text would get swapped out for a link to blahblah.

In order to keep track of the paddings and itemized sections and subsections, I think of using a stack which I can push and pop the current and next positions needed to draw a text line each time I leave a content. Yet, I cant figure out how to jump back to a certain subsection position because stack doesnt offer an inline subscripting method.  Then I look into a hashmap in C I have tried Dictionary to keep track of it and to access the value via specific key. For that I also use a external global variable to maintain the number of subsections the user may have entered and increase one each time a new subsection is created and the float value is used to store the xcoordinate value for the drawstring to be done. This is complicated to me at least at present when I dont really have a nerve to go into it anymore. I can only receive false simulated outcomes.br So I am asking for an easier approach to tackle this problem, which I think is simple to many of you sure experiencing the same situation. I am desperately looking forward to seeing a short easy method to do this.   p

Negative 717 pI am migrating an application from ExtJS 3.x to v4 and have been having some troubles with the TabPanels now that the autoHeight property has been removed. I know that if you do not explicitly define a height for the panel it is assumed to be auto height, but that is only true to a degree. p  pIn ExtJS4, a tab panel with no height set will still have inline css height values set on the tab panels containing divs, and those heights are calculated from the initial height of each tab items content. And yes, if you update the height of any child components of the tab items, the height of the tab will be recalculated to fit it, or if the tab contains raw HTML and the tabs update method is used to change that content, its height again, will be adjusted to fit.p  pWhere the issue is, in my application anyway, is that I update the raw HTML content of those tabs using methods other than those in ExtJSs framework, such as jQuery.html. Since the tab panel is not being notified of this change to the content, it does not recalculate the height value of the tab. p  pTo get around this all I want to do is ensure that the tab panels containing elements always are set to heightauto when rendered, rerendered, or anything else. Im assuming to accomplish this I would need to extend the TabPanel, but i don not know where to start as far as what methods to override, ect. Any thoughtsp

Negative 717 pIn the primary application on which I have been working, and with which Stack Overflow gurus have been lifesavers, I decided to avoid some of the asynchronous complications Ive seen, by splitting the SortArray branch of my main routine off into its own function. Testing that shows perfect results just before the function returns those results.p  pThe way this saves me some processing is that I can sort the array embeforeem I send it into the main processing function. That way, all arrays are treated identically throughout the ProcessArray function.p  pIn the code example below, I show the current structure, which is my interpretation of advice given most recently by jfriend00. I make two .getJSON calls, the second within the success clause of the first, and just before I end that first getJSON call at which point I have tested and validated the arrays created during the processing not shown here, I call SortArray on one of the arrays, then pass it to the routine that sends the result into ProcessArray.p  pDespite the success of the SortArray code emwithin itselfem, the array that enters ProcessArray by this means is noted as undefined.

Negative 717 pI recently had an interview. In the context of my mini project explanation, the interviewer asked me where did you store the users uploaded image files.p  pI replied that I used the file system rather than database. I also added that doing so wouldnt degrade the performance.p  pThose images can be viewed by anyone, so there might be accesses from many users for an image.p  pTo my surprise, he said that when your file is accessed by many, then you should use the database.p  pI argued with him that when the data has no concerns with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability then why use a database.....p  pBut he kept saying that when multiple users are accessing same file, then a database is to be used. He also said that many organizations do the same and thatwhy would there be a blob type in databases if storing files is not done in database.p  pI nodded to him I didnt want any further debating.p  pSo, now Im confused.  Is what he said true Should one use a database for files when there are multiple accesses Do many organizations do that If yes, please explain me why is that so.p

Negative 717 pI have a C app in which I create pthreads to run user provided functions. I want to be able to be alerted in some way when a thread exits so that I can remove it from an array of pthread that I am using to keep the threads. Is there a way to do this, or should the function just set some magic value. Because my main code that spawns the pthreads is in a sort of runloop, I can easily check for an exit condition. p  hr  pAlso, is using a codestdvectorltpthreadtgtcode overdoing to keep track of my threads an overload The number of threads is not necessarily any sort of constant, many threads or very few could be running.

Negative 717 pLS I have a widget on a tabsheet. During setup of the app window the size of the tabsheet is used to determine the size for the widget. The widget size is then set to fully cover fill the tabsheet. When I resize the window the tab is also resized, but the widget remains at the original size as from the initialisation. I would like a recalculation for the size of my widget so it can be set to a new size after the tab size has been changed. I need a trigger that captures a window resize event and then do the widget size recalculation. How can this be done  Tnxp

Negative 717 pI am badly confused about the authorization process. I am working upon a web app, where we have groups, in which people work together  hence the information is available to all the people within the group. We also have a feature to follow a group did I hear twitter so that the followers of the group can also access, but only to read, the data of the group in my case, some posts, yes fblike posts. The problem is authorizing people  in a bemgoodemb way. Actually, I have got the work going well since I have directly fed the authorization work into the sql queries that I use  by limiting the records in the WHERE clause. But for some reason I find this way bad  very bad. Only if I could add the authorization work in the code, it would feel better. But maybe this approach is good, I dont know If it is so then tell so, or tell me a better way to do this. And yes, I am creating a RESTful API, if that may help in understanding my problem. On the last note, I am just a beginnerintermediateer  in all this, so please bear with me if you dont feel the problem described properly. One more thing, it is not a copy of facebook or twitter or a mix of both. Thanksp  pOk. Maybe I should include a code sample of the Data Access Layer. That should make understanding my problem easier. Heres the code which returns a project with a given id. A project is accessible either to project members listed in projectmembers table or to those who are following it listed in projectfollowers table.p  precode    public function getProjectByIdid          auth  new Auth         userid  authgtgetCurrentUserId           sql  SELECT P.id, P.userId, P.name, P.description, P.creationTime, P.startTime, P.endTime, P.isOpen FROM projects P INNER JOIN projectmembers PM ON PM.projectid  P.id AND P.id  id AND PM.userId  userid OR P.isOpen  1          return thisgtresultsql, array userid gt userid, id gt id       codepre  pNow, for some obscure reason I find the query dirty. Maybe it might be clean, but is it good to handle authorization this way. Or is there any other better wayp
Negative 717 pNormally, NaN not a number propagates through calculations, so I dont need to check for NaN in each step. This works almost always, but apparently there are exceptions. For examplep  precodegtgtgt nan  floatnan gtgtgt pownan, 0 1.0 codepre  pI found the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNaNFunctiondefinition relnofollowfollowing commenta on thisp  blockquote   pThe propagation of quiet NaNs through arithmetic operations allows   errors to be detected at the end of a sequence of operations without   extensive testing during intermediate stages. However, note that   depending on the language and the function, NaNs can silently be   removed in expressions that would give a constant result for all other   floatingpoint values e.g. NaN0, which may be defined as 1, so in   general a later test for a set INVALID flag is needed to detect all   cases where NaNs are introduced.p      pTo satisfy those wishing a more strict interpretation of how the power   function should act, the 2008 standard defines two additional power   functions pownx, n where the exponent must be an integer, and   powrx, y which returns a NaN whenever a parameter is a NaN or the   exponentiation would give an indeterminate form.p blockquote  pIs there a way to check the INVALID flag mentioned above through Python Alternatively, is there any other approach to catch cases where NaN does not propagatep  pMotivation I decided to use NaN for missing data. In my application, missing inputs should result in missing result. It works great, with the exception I described. p

Negative 717 pSo I am trying to understand a problem with Qts QStateMachine and Im hoping someone can help explain why this is happening. Im very interested in the fundamental understanding of QStateMachine rather than just the fix.p  pFirst consider the state machine with states A, and B and event 1. Event 1 brings you from A to B. A is the initial state.p  pSpecifically this is for maintaining neighbors. In device X I get a message where a neighbor Y says hello. This causes neighbor X to malloc a neighbor state machine for this new neighbor Y. This makes the neighbor state machine and then calls QStateMachinestart  p  pNow after this state machine is started I need to continue processing this hello message. So at first I was doingp  precodeQStateMachinestart   emit event 1  codepre  pMy understanding is this wont work because start is an async call and so the state machine is not in its initial start until after start is done. That leads me to my first question.p  pem1 So the state machine start gets placed in the qapp event queue but isnt emit an async call as well Wont the event 1 be placed in the event queue after the start and so wouldnt that mean we will be in the initial state Or is the emit not an async callemp  pThinking this was the problem I changed my code a little by connecting a function to the state machine started signal. I then changed my code to queue up the events if the state machine is not started and I process this queue of pending events and emit them to the state machine after the started signal is called.p  pWell it turns out the initial state is STILL not set when I get started signal. e.g. QStateMachineconfiguration .contains initialstate    false. This leads me to my second and bigger question.p  pem2 Why when the started signal is emitted am I not in the initial state.emp  pThe sequence of events here isp  ol liCreate state machineli liSet initial stateli liStart state machineli liReceive event 1 li liSince not started queue event 1li liStarted signal rxedli liProcess event 1li liSince is unknown state do nothingli liReceive event 1li liProcess event 1li liNow in state A. transition to state B.li ol  pThe sequence should bep  ol liCreate state machine li liSet initial stateli liStart state machineli liReceive event 1li liSince not started queue event 1 li liStarted signal rxed li liProcess event 1 li liNow is state A. transition to state B.li liReceive event 1 li liProcess event 1 li liNow is state B.

Negative 717 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pMy company is about to undertake the internationalization of its corporate website with approx 3000 pages of static content per language. My current question is regarding the serving of internationalized static content from the Apache Web Server v2.4.1. p  pstrongApache Documentationstrongp  pWhile reading the documentation I have learned that Apache supports the serving of multilanguage content through the addition of the language code at the end of the filename, egp  precodeindex.html.en index.html.zh index.html.kr codepre  pemthe codes are just for illustration, they may well be incorrectemp  pstrongContent Structurestrongp  pHowever our static content is managed within our Documentum WCM, and my Documentum team inform me that when pushing the content onto our web servers, the WCM would output its data in the following structurep  precode...enfullcontenttree.html ...krfullcontenttree.html ...jafullcontenttree.html ...zhfullcontenttree.html codepre  pstrongMy ProblemQuestionstrongp  pSo, what I would like to know is how can I configure the Apache HTTP Server to serve content from a different content tree, based on the TLD that the user requests, meaning that if a user requests the URL codehttpwww.mycompany.cnfullcontenttree.htmlcode it would serve the content from the code...zh....code tree. Notice that the language code does not appear in the URL  in fact all URLs should remain the same, with the exception of the domain name.p  pIn other words, strongemthe TLD used to access the content, dictates the language being shownemstrong.p  pWe would be starting with probably the following domain TLDsp  precodehttpwww.mycompany.com httpwww.mycompany.cn httpwww.mycompany.co.kr httpwww.mycompany.com.tw httpwww.mycompany.co.jp codepre  pIm sure this is not a completely uncommon approach, but Im a little at a loss at how to proceed with this, so any help you could provide would be gratefully received.p  pThanks,p  pemstrongNotestrong I do not need answers on whether the approach of forcing specific domains to serve specific language content is the best approach  this has already been debated internally and decided  I lost.emp

I originally built the app as a universal application and then shipped it as iPhone onlyalthough it still runs scaled, of course. I was thinking about using IAP to unlock a true, full HD iPad UI. Has anyone done this before Thoughts I like this idea because it still allows for the functionality without paying for the upgrade, but then allows users who want a crisper interface to have one for only a few dollars more. My main worry is that Apple isnt going to like this, although I havent found any documentation directly stating that it isnt allowed. p
Negative 717 pI am experiencing an issue on iOS 4.3 with ASIHTTPRequest where a request is fired but no data Request methed, url, headers, etc reaches the server. The connection times out because it never hears back.p  pThe server hears the empty request after some delay, then hears a valid request which is of course never reported to higher level code because the connection has timed out. This is all kind of strange because the request was not configured to resend data.p  pOften this happens after the app has been pushed to the background for some time 15 min or more and the phone has been allowed to sleep. p  pMy configuration of the request is as followsp  precodeNSMutableData postData  nil  NSString urlString  [NSString stringWithFormat,[self baseURL],requestPath]  OTSHTTPRequest request  [OTSHTTPRequest requestWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringurlString]] [request setCachePolicyASIFallbackToCacheIfLoadFailsCachePolicy] [request setTimeOutSeconds45] Set up body NSString queryString  [self RPcreateQueryStringquery] if [queryString length]gt0      ifmethod  RPAsyncServerMethodPost  method  RPAsyncServerMethodPut         postData  [[[queryString dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding allowLossyConversionYES] mutableCopy] autorelease]     else         NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithString[urlString stringByAppendingFormat,queryString]]         [request setURLurl]         if url return nil url String malformed.         ...   method setting stripped for brevity  [request addRequestHeaderContentType valueapplicationxwwwformurlencoded]  ifheaders     for NSString head in headers          if [[headers valueForKeyhead] isKindOfClass[NSString class]]              [request addRequestHeaderhead value[headers valueForKeyhead]]       [request addRequestHeaderContentLength valuepostLength] [request setPostBodypostData] codepre  pOTSHTTPRequest is simply a subclass of ASIHTTPRequest that contains properties for a string tag, a pretty description, and other bling for use by consuming objects and does not override any ASI stuff.p  pCan anyone shed a light on whyhow ASI could open a connection and then send absolutely nothing for minutes at a timep  pEdit Just to clarify. The connections DO make contact with the server, it just never sends any data through the connection from what my server logs can tell. This seems to always happen on app wake and effects all connections including NSURLConnections spawned by MapKit. the whole app just seems to loose its marbles. I also see a bunch of background tasks ending badly right before this, but i can never catch them while in the debugger. p

Negative 717 pIm currently working in a big java project with quite a few submodules that are worked on by different teams. Some of these teams are building the framework, others are building the application based on the framework.p  pWhen the framework guys move or rename a class, the applications guys get compile errors wherever they are using a refactored framework class. Is there a way in strongEclipsestrong strongGalileo Releasestrong to record the change and update the references in another workspacep  pWhat Ive tried so far is creating a refactoring script during the rename refactoring, but when I try to apply that script to another workspace, it fails with codeThe refactoring Rename Type org.eclipse.jdt.ui.rename.type cannot be performed, since its input xxx.TestClass does not existscode. Well, it does not exist anymore alright, but what I want is for all references for codexxx.TestClasscode in my project to be changed to codexxx.MyRenamedTestClasscode. Is there a way in Eclipse to do this with builtin functionality or an existing plugin or do I have to write one myselfp  pThanks for your helpp  pEDIT By now I found out that the Migrate JARPlugin provides the functionality I am looking for, although we build our JARs with Maven, not Eclipse.

Negative 717 pIm writing a 2D object editor so that I can more quickly create UI for basic programs. Im not using any bitmaps at all. Instead Im just drawing primitives with function calls in the game loop. Everything so far has been fine, but Id like to know how to alter the colors of objects during runtime. p  pThe basic concept is that I use a variable for the color, and when the user calls the function that changes the value of that variable, that changes the color. Simple. Something likep  precodevoid runColor   ALLEGROCOLOR color  NULL     ifevent.mouse.buttonamp1       color  almaprgb255, 0, 0    else       color  almaprgb0, 255, 0     aldrawfilledrectanglefirstXval, firstYval, secondXval, secondYval, color   codepre  pUnfortunately, this doesnt work. When I use similar code, the objects are simply not drawn up. Theres no compilation errors, no runtime errors, no nothing. Instead, the objects have no color and are therefore invisible, though Ive verified that they do in fact get created. Sooo I guess that means the color variable is somehow the right type, but does not retain the value of codealmaprgbcode when its set equal to whatever that function returns. I know it has to return something, because otherwise it couldnt be an argument in the codealdrawcode functions.p  pWhile I could just write out if else if statements that lead to different draw functions, Id rather just have a simple little bundle of code like above than a bunch of redundant stuff that solves something that should be simple. Id just prefer not to go with the code equivalent of duct tape. p  pSo Im sure the problem probably has to do with my assumption that codealmaprgbcode returns a value of codeALLEGROCOLORcode, but I dont know. Would you guys be willing to make some suggestionsp

Negative 717 pA website contains a random link, which loads a url that returns a 307 redirecting to the url we want. It works fine click it and you load a random page. The problem is that each time you click it, the browser assumes youre loading the same page so if youre on the homepage, then you follow the random link 5 times, then you press back, youll be taken all the way back to the homepage, with no way to find the random pages you were just looking at. I want to modify this behavior so that users can access previous random pages via the back and forward buttons.p  pI dont own the website, so I cant just change the redirect code.p  pHeres what Ive tried, all of which has failed.p  ul liPredicting what would be redirected to. While somewhat possible, there would be no way to avoid failure in up to .1 of clicks, and it would react very poorly to unexpected events, like a page thats published a day late, let alone a sit structure change.li liLoading the 307 page via ajax. The request stops at codereadystate  2code and I cant access the codelocationcode header.li liCancel the click event and instead set codelocation.href  randomlink.hrefcode.

As above, I cant tell when the back button is being used.li ul  pIm working on a solution that Im pretty sure will work, involving loading the page in an iframe over the existing page and using a background process and messaging to work around the fact that content injections from chrome extensions cant access codewindow.parentcode from within iframes. And using the history API to reflect the current iframes URL in the address bar, and get the back and forwards buttons to apply to the current iframe where appropriate.p  pWhile Im pretty sure the last solution can be made to work, its a hideously complex and heavyweight approach to what seems like a simple problem.

Negative 717 pIm try to understand codeRepositorycode pattern to implement it in my app. And Im stuck with it in a some way.p  pHere is a simplified algorithm of how the app is accessing to a datap  ol lipAt first time the app has no data. It needs to connect to a webservice to get this data. So all the lowlevel logic of interaction with the webservice will be hiding behind the codeWebServiceRepositorycode class. All the data passed from the webservice to the app will be cached.pli lipNext time when the app will request the data this data will be searched in the cache before requesting them from the webservice. Cache represents itself as a database and XML files and will be accessed through the codeCacheRepositorycode.p  pThe cached data can be in three states valid can be shown to user, invalid old data that cant be shown and partlyvalid can be shown but must be updated as soon as possible.p  pa If the cached data is valid then after we get them we can stop.p  pb If the chached data is invalid or partlyvalid we need to access codeWebServiceRepositorycode. If the access to the webservice is ended with a success then requested data will be cached and then will be showed to user I think this must be implemented as a second call to the codeCacheRepositorycode.p  pc So the entry point of the data access is the codeCacheRepositorycode. Webservice will be called only if there is no fully valid cache.pli ol  pI cant figure out where to place the logic of verifying the cache validinvalidpartlyvalid Where to place the call of the codeWebServiceRepositorycode I think that this logic cant be placed in no one of codeRepositoriescode, because of violation the Single Responsibility Principle SRP from SOLID.p  pShould I implement some sort of codeRepositoryServicecode and put all the logic in it Or maybe is there a way to link codeWebServiceRepositorycode and codeWebServiceRepositorycode p  pWhat are patterns and approaches to implement thatp  pAnother question is how to get partlyvalid data from cache and then request the webservice in the one methods call I think to use delegates and events. Is there other approachesp  pPlease, give an advice. Which is the correct way to link all the functionality listed abovep  pP.S. Maybe I described all a bit confusing. I can give some additional clarifications if needed.p  pP.P.S. Under codeCacheRepositorycode and under codeWebServiceRepositorycode I meant a set of repositories  codeCustomerCacheRepositorycode, codeProductCacheRepositorycode and so on.

I can create users with some custom profile properties and log in and out. p  pThe problem is my create user form. As in the tutorial I have in my service project made a class called NewUser, with data annotations.

Or rather, add 999.990 records for each tblAIDs, since Table B already has 10 records for each of those IDs. p  pMy solution is using the codecursorscode, get onebyone in table A, with each codetblAIDcode, get it, find its data at table B and insert into both tables then.p  pSo, is it possible Do you have any suggestion to solve this case p

Negative 717 pI find myself doing a lot of work here and there both for myself and on contract to develop small, static websites where the use of dynamic tools like PHP frameworks or Rails would be totally useless and heavyhanded and a waste of resources.p  pIm looking for a way to author static HTML sites that introduces a level of modularity and syntax simplification to clarify, something like SASS for HTML with a fast syntax and that allows common patterns to be extruded out in to separate files.p  pIm aware of HAML.  I would love for HAML to be my solution.  But in all of my reading, HAML doesnt seem to have an equivalent to a SASSstyle include directive used for inlining the content of external files.  In addition, HAML seems to bill itself as more of a templating engine than an authoring tool the way SASS bills itself it seems to have a desire to be a replacement for ERB and to be used in Rails projects, rather than being used as a modular HTML preprocessor.p  pI know I could roll my own solution by bolting a small amount of Ruby and inline evaluation on to HAML, but it feels a little cheap and dirty since this isnt really what HAML wants to do.  Its not a solution Im averse to, but if there is a noconfiguration, lightweight option out there that basically behaves like SASS but for HTML then Id prefer to go that route.p

Negative 717 pIs there an alternative or a more preferred way of displaying images in Win 8 HTMLJSCSS programming Is the  tag the standard way to display image If I test my app with a mouse I can drag an image around inside the app which is of course useless  at least as far as my apps concerned.

Negative 717 pIn order to build shaders for Windows Store apps and Windows Phone 8 Shader model 40level93 you need to use the vs40level93 and ps40level93 . While all this sounds fine using the HLSL syntax designed for DirectX 10 and up, Im unable to use the VPOS semantic from DirectX 9 or use SVPOSITION from DirectX 10 and up in a pixel shader, so what do I do besides making yet another semantic for outputting the vertex position in clip space p  pPS Some shaders on 40level93 spit out an internal error blob content mismatch between level9 and d3d10 shader which I have no idea what is about. Probably some inconsistency with the driver I suppose  I use an Nvidia GTX 560 TI that I see it goes away if you just compile your shaders with release flags like optimization level 3 and avoid flow control.p

Negative 717 pI found out that the method codepaintcode gets called some time it cant happen immediately, can it after the activation of codeinitcode, not after it finishes. I have a few objects that get created in codeinitcode and drawn in the codepaintcode method. But the drawing starts before the objects get initialized. This causes exceptions, that are handled automatically. But it also causes the objects not to get drawn after the the first activation of codepaintcode they need to be redrawn in order to show up.p  pI was able to block the codepaintcode methods work with an infinite cycle, placed int the beginning of the method, that doesnt stop until codeinitcode finishes its work I guess codeinitcode and codepaintcode run in separate threads. But an employed Java programmer told me that this isnt an elegant solution I should try to do something different the guy didnt tell me what to do, he is not working with applets and I guess, he has never encountered this problem, thats why Im asking here.p  pHow can I make sure that the codepaintcode method doesnt activate before codeinitcode finishes working, and how can I make it in an elegant way what ever thats supposed to mean in this case...p  pEDITp  pI am using Dr. Java for some reason, it runs the applet differently on two different computers a really old laptop 7yearsold that runs with Win XP and a 2yearsold desktop PC that runs with Win 7.

It only occurs with the editor installed on the laptop. I guess the problem is in the code editor running on the old tech, not in the code.p

Negative 717 pIm pretty new to all of this, but Im currently working on a pet project where Im trying to allow a client to slice an image into sometimes onconventional polygons. p  pI originally planned to this by having the user click around an image within an image e.g. click around a baseball bat they want from a picture of Barry Bonds and save it as an original image. p  pMy original coding thoughts were to use canvas and a click event to draw around the image in loops using html5s canvas until the starting point equalled the end point. After I had the polygons coordinates, I would use map to retroactively generate the image. I was thinking that having a color reader and regenerating the image from scratch might be necessary but incredibly difficult. As a result of this last part, Ive been running through a bunch of bugs. Has anybody had any success with something like this Should I bail on allowing odd polygons or should I just scrap it and head to Mozilla and Google kits to do my biddingp  pThanks for the help.p

The formula works in the first cell, not in those its dragged over. It also works in seemingly random cells when pasted around see screen shot.p  pFormula is below... this was a brand new sheet, the cells had not been initialized until the formula was pasted. Is this an issue with Excel 2013 Since the formula works in some pastes perfectly, and not in others, I dont think thats the issue...

Negative 717 pI want to save log entries to my MySQL database from Zend Framework 2. I am using codeZendLogLoggercode with a codeZendLogWriterDbcode writer. By supplying the writer with an array, one can choose which columns to save what data to e.g. timestamp into a logdate column and which data to save. Here is what I am doingp  precodelogger  new ZendLogLogger  mapping  array     timestamp gt timestampcolumn,     priority  gt prioritycolumn,     message   gt messagecolumn,     extra gt extracolumn   loggergtaddWriternew ZendLogWriterDbdbAdapter, tablename, mapping loggergterrsome message, arraysome extra information codepre  pThe problem I am facing is that the array of column names and their values contain an incorrect column name for the extra column. Based on the array above, it should be inserting  the value some extra information into the extracolumn column. The problem is that the codeZendLogWriterDbcode class is using the letter e as the name of the extra column. This comes from the first letter of extracolumn in my array above. For some reason, it is taking the first letter of extracolumn and using it as the column name instead of the entire value.p  pI took a look at the source code. The codemapEventIntoColumncode method is being used to get the column names and values as an array. I copied in the relevant part of the method below.p  precode Example  event  arrayextra gt array0 gt some extra information  columnMap  arrayextra gt extracolumn  Return arraye gt some extra information  Expected without looking at the code below arrayextracolumn gt some extra information protected function mapEventIntoColumnarray event, array columnMap  null      data  array     foreach event as name gt value          if isarrayvalue              foreach value as key gt subvalue                  if issetcolumnMap[name][key]                      data[columnMap[name][key]]  subvalue                                                 return data  codepre  pThe codeeventcode parameter is an array containing the same keys as my codemappingcode array in my first code snippet and the values for the log message. The codecolumnMapcode parameter is the codemappingcode array from my first code snippet array values are column names.p  pWhat actually seems to happen is that because I am passing in extra information as an array this is required, the inner foreach loop is executed. Here, codekeycode is 0 the index so it is actually doing like this codecolumnMap[extra][0]code. This gives the letter e the first letter in extracolumn, which is used as the column name, where it should be the entire column name instead.p  pI tried to supply my own key in the extra array when calling the log method, but the same happens. The official documentation shows no examples of usage of the extra parameter. I want to insert information that can help me debug errors into my table, so I would like to use it.p  pIs this a bug or am I missing something It seems really strange to me I hope I explained it well enough  it is quite trickyp

Negative 717 pIm trying to design a web page these days that is a bit hard.p  pI have three main divs. First one for header, another for footer, and third one for main content. Header and footer must be fixed in top and bottom of the page. Their place mustnt change with resizing of browser window. Third div must be in the blank space between those divs. It can resize to fit the page with window resize.p  pHeight of main div must exactly change, because I want to place a Google Maps in that div, so the height of this div is important.p  pI tried so many things, but they were not successful. Setting codeheightcode of the div to 100while height of body and html is 100, too was not the answer. Using a table with three rows, two rows with fixed height, one row with variable height, with codeheight100code had some problems, tooin IE8, when I declared a codedoctypecode, the div in second row with codeheight100code didnt fit the cell anymore.p  pNow I have no idea to do this work. What can I dop  pstrongNotestrong I prefer not to use CSS3, because compatibility with old browsers is important for me.p

Negative 717 pMy UIViewController has a UIPageViewController embedded in it.  The pager can contain anywhere from 538 pages each page is an instance of a UIViewController subclass depending on the situation.  Ive noticed that depending how complicated I make the UI elements on each page, the app slows down considerably, and is very slow when swiping to go to the next page.p  pHeres the thing  the view on each page is identical, except for the values of a few UITextViews.  I am building the view in each pages viewDidLoad method each time viewControllerAtIndex is called for a new page.  I feel like there must be a way to reuse the same view for each page, and just swap the text values that are supposed to be different.  Can anyone describe a strategy to do thisp  pLike I said, every page has an identical view hierarchy except the values for some of the text, so Im really just looking for a way to maintain one basic view controller per page, but cache the view hierarchy to be reused on each page, and swap out some simple text values depending on page number.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSomething I forgot to mention in the original post is that Im building my view programmatically because the number of elements on the page is dependent on choices the user made on previous screens.  i.e. there may be 5 TextViews or 10 TextViews, etc. depending on what the user selected on a previous screen before coming to the UIPageViewController.  With that said, I do not believe an xib based approach will work because the initial layout is dynamic.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 717 pLike a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11793890customdjangoadmintemplatesnotworkingthis questiona, my admin overrides arent working in my production environment but they are in my development environment same django version.

Negative 717 pIm modifying an existing iReport file, one that supposedly asks for an input from a program. The input is then placed in a table, which I assume, automatically adds rows as the data comes in.p  pHowever, the program isnt putting out the data, and is no longer required to do so. So now I only need an empty table to be displayed.p  pWhat Ive done in iReport is to remove all traces of parameters since they are no longer needed, and copy and paste all the cells until they reach the bottom of the page. Now none of the cells except the header, and top row, because they have static text are visible, and one of the reports even went as far as displaying a blank page.p  pIve tried setting the Report Properties When No Data to either No Data Section, or All SectionsNo Detail, but its still empty with no visible cells. Ive also tried putting a space in the textfields, hoping that it would show, and even replacing them with rectangles which worked in another report. However, nothing worked. The reports still show only the header.p  pHow can I fix this Thanks.p  pHeres the JRXMLp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8  gt lt Created with iReport  A designer for JasperReports gt ltDOCTYPE

Negative 717 pIm trying to monitor unicorn workers with monit, so it gracefully kills them when they reach certain memory threshold.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWhen I tell monit to restart a worker it first tries to stop it, firing my codeetcinit.dunicorn killworker 0code script command.p  precode my etcmonitconfig.dunicorn file check process orlyunicornworker0 with pidfile tmpunicorn.orly.0.pid   start program  bintrue   stop program  etcinit.dunicornorly killworker 0 codepre  pAs I am monitoring processes via the codetopcode command I see how the worker is killed and how the master spawns a new worker with, of course, another pid.p  pMonit, however, waits for a while and throws a failed to stop error in its log. It is actually waiting 30 seconds and timing out.p  pOnce it times out, monit recognizes that the coderestart action is donecode, and then notices the worker PID has changed and continues to monitor the process as expected.p  pAs a result everything is working, monit is able to restart a worker when needed and keep monitoring them, but the log is full of errors, the web interface shows a nasty and confusing codeexecution failedcode error status on the worker, and I guess it would send erroneous email alerts if they were set up.p  pThis is the relevant part of the log, when I try to restart a worker through the web interface notice how it also gets confused with the workers parent PIDp  precode[UTC Mar  5 132917] info      orlyunicornworker0 trying to restart [UTC Mar  5 132917] info      orlyunicornworker0 stop etcinit.dunicornorly [UTC Mar  5 132947] error     orlyunicornworker0 failed to stop [UTC Mar  5 132947] info      orlyunicornworker0 restart action done [UTC Mar  5 132947] error     orlyunicornworker0 process PID changed to 13699 [UTC Mar  5 132949] error     orlyunicornworker0 process PPID changed to 0 [UTC Mar  5 133019] info      orlyunicornworker0 process PID has not changed since last cycle [UTC Mar  5 133019] error     orlyunicornworker0 process PPID changed to 13660 [UTC Mar  5 133049] info      orlyunicornworker0 process PPID has not changed since last cycle codepre  pThis took me a long time to figure out but, whats happening here is that the worker gets killed and then respawned so quickly that monit doesnt even notice the change.p  pMy guess is that monit, when performing the stop action, reads the codetmpunicorn.orly.0.pidcode to get the pid of the process and then looks to see if that process stil exists.p  pHowever since the emkillrespawn worker operationem happens so fast monit doesnt realize that the pid of the worker has changed and keeps waiting for the bran new worker to die. Then it times out, then it realizes the pid has actually changed and it goes as normal.p  pstrongThe dirty solution I have foundstrongp  pTo prove this hypothesis I tried to slow down the mentioned emkillrespawn worker operationem. So I edited the unicorn config file to sleep the new workers a few seconds just before they write down their new pid in codetmpunicorn.orly.0.pidcode. p  pI did it like thisp  precodeafterfork do server, worker   sleep 3     write down the new worker PID so monit can monitor it   childpid  server.config[pid].sub.pid, .worker.nr.pid   systemecho Process.pid gt childpid end codepre  pAnd it worked wonderfully birds and flowers sing in the sunny day, the web interface now shows a nice codeprocess runningcode status, logs show everything is going smoothly, take a lookp  precode[UTC Mar  5 133044] info      orlyunicornworker0 trying to restart [UTC Mar  5 133044] info      orlyunicornworker0 stop etcinit.dunicornorly [UTC Mar  5 133045] info      orlyunicornworker0 stopped [UTC Mar  5 133045] info      orlyunicornworker0 start bintrue [UTC Mar  5 133046] info      orlyunicornworker0 restart action done codepre  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pIs there a emmonitwayem of achieving this Sleeping my workers for 3 seconds doesnt seem like a good solution.

Negative 717 pI am experiencing something which is not an emergency problem as my application works however, but I really would like to understand why it is behaving like this.br There is in my program a method findFilterInTable with two string inputs categoryInterval and paymentInterval.  p  pThe method is sending a request to my database, finding elements in some columns where categoryInterval  something and paymentInterval  something depending on buttons clicked, choices of the user, and so on.  p  pThere is in my application a radiobutton setting the value of paymentInterval like this   p  precodeOnClickListener radiobuttonnolistener  new OnClickListener      public void onClickView v          paymentInterval  null          OnClickListener radiobuttonyeslistener  new OnClickListener      public void onClickView v          paymentInterval   LIKE    visa              codepre  pstrongSo when the user clicks the button NO, it means paymentInterval is null.strong p  pNow, here is my method querying my database. As it was crashing while making a request in the COLPAYMENT when paymentInterval was null, I want to change the query so  if paymentInterval is null, then it will not query the related column in my database COLPAYMENT. And else if paymentInterval isnt null, it will query COLPAYMENT and collect results.br I tried this way, it didnt work and in despair i just exchanged my statement and now it works   p  precode public Cursor findFilterInTableString categoryInterval,         String paymentInterval      String where     if paymentInterval  null          where    COLCAT1   IN   categoryInterval   OR                   COLCAT2   IN   categoryInterval   OR   COLCAT3                   IN   categoryInterval   AND   COLPAYMENT                  paymentInterval              else          where  COLCAT1   IN   categoryInterval   OR   COLCAT2                   IN   categoryInterval   OR   COLCAT3   IN                   categoryInterval           Cursor c  myDatabase.queryDATABASETABLE, new String[]  KEYROWID,             COLNAME, COLSTREET, COLWEBSITE, COLPAYMENT, COLTELEPHONE,             COLPRICE, COLREMARKS, COLDATEFRIENDLY , where, null, null,             null, null     return c  codepre  pThis code works and do this opposite of what is written. When I use my applicationbr  if paymentInterval is null the user clicks NO, it doesnt query the COLPAYMENTbr  if paymentInterval isnt null and is like visa in my case, it does query the database and display the right results.   p  pDo you know what causes this weird results p  p[edit] listener attached to my buttons   p  precoderadiobuttonyes  RadioButton dialogView                 .findViewByIdR.id.radiobuttonyes         radiobuttonyes.setOnClickListenerradiobuttonyeslistener          radiobuttonno  RadioButton dialogView                 .findViewByIdR.id.radiobuttonno         radiobuttonno.setOnClickListenerradiobuttonnolistener codepre

Negative 717 pI am trying to send a message via WCF and MSMQ and apply a transformation to the message content before it is sent. p  pI can capture the message in the BeforeSendRequest event of a Client Message Inspector, grab the message as xml and apply an Xslt transform to it that essentialy replaces a parameter value in the soap message that was null when the message was built. When the message arrives at that other endpoint though, the parameter is still null even though Ive tried my best to insert a value into the message.p  pIf I hard code the message to contain the expected parameter all works as expected, it only fails with a null value when I apply the transform. Dont know if I am doing something fundamentally wrong here Im new to most of these topics or if my soap xml is just wrong. p  pIve looked at the xml created when I hard code the response and used this as the basis of my transform.

Negative 717 pI have posted another relative question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17877118Java Servlet delete temporary fileap  pAs per the suggestion of BalusC, I have been trying to implement something different, but to no success. p  pTherefore, I want to ask the following is it possible to inject HTML contents into an iframe at runtimep  pJust to clarify, I am working with Servlets and JSP.

It works, but I have an ulterior problem the links in the page contained inside the iframe are appropriately changed so that they function properly. The effect is that one can navigate inside the iframe as if it were a browser tab. So, when a link on the page is clicked, the temporary file gets rewritten with the contents of the site the link points to. However, the page is not reloaded, and I gather it is because the browser retrives the cached page, and not the page from the browser. I tried refreshing the source of the iframe via JavaScipt and it functions, but there is delay, and the page loads twice  I dont want that. I have also tried doind it with codedocument.writecode in JavaScript on the iframe object, again with no success. p  pA last clarification the iframe should contain the whole HTML of the page, complete with the codelthtmlgtcode and codelthtmlgtcode tags I did think of creating a JSP page with a DIV perhaps, and injecting the content there, but thats not what I want either...p  pThank you in advancep

My problem is that the php pages Im converting already have a high page rank, therefore Id like to keep their URLs exactly the way it was.p  pIm not sure how to set my routes.rb so that example.com will always go to my homepage however, when   nameofoneofthelandingpages Rails will route to a separate controller, where a specific action will determine which page to render, based on an Initializer and the params hash, all this while the URL is, as mentioned, identical to what it was prior to the phptoRoR conversion, namely www.example.comnameoflandingpage, rather than www.example.comcontrollernamenameoflandingpage.p  pI know of the path property that enables one to exclude the controller name from the path if passed an empty string i.e. coderesources examples, path gt code, but that doesnt quite solve the entire problem.p  pI was thinking about writing an initializer that would hold a hash of all relevant landing pages, and using constraints in routes.rb to check against it, but Im not sure if this kind of implementation is possible and how to go about it. A code example would be much appreciated.p  pIs there some kind of syntax for routes.rb that would enable me to do so, or perhaps a better solution p

Negative 717 pIve got a couple of code.tcode files in a folder.  Each test script launches its own instance of Selenium and therefore opens its own browser.

Negative 717 pHere is what I need I have an image and want to plot on specific rectangleshaped parts of it e.g., imagine having a picture of a chessboard and wanting to fill every square with a different color. I would like to be able to easily specify the coordinates for these parts and take these coordinates into R for plotting.p  pI dont have any experience with making such plots. Ive thought of simply inserting an image into a plot with rasterImage , then plotting with polygon , but the task of setting up the coordinates for the polygon function seemed too time consuming  hence the question above.p  pIf you have any better ideas than using a set of coordinates for the polygon function, please share. Any leads or packages suggestions would also be helpful. p  pthank you. Marko.p

Negative 717 pIm messing around with C sockets trying to achieve a certain functionality for my app.p  pA, I can create network sockets which block when I read from them, and will also update the codefilecode position.  So, if I read one packet, the next read call will wait, and then give me the subsequent packet.p  pB, I can also create network sockets which do not block either setting codeODONTBLOCKcode or using a coderecvcode with the codeDONTWAITcode flag.  However, after reading a packet and the socket not receiving any new data, these sockets always seem to not block hurray and immediately return data from the start of the socket.p  pSo the functionality looks a little likebr Ap  precodereturn packet 1 ...wait... return packet 2 codepre  pBp  precodereturn packet 1 return packet 1 return packet 1 return packet 1 return packet 2 which just arrived codepre  pIm trying to figure out how to read data from a network socket so that it both doesnt block and doesnt try to return old data when nothing new has arrived.  As it standsp  precoderecvconnfd, amppacket, sizeofpackett, MSGDONTWAIT codepre  pnever returns the code1code that, in the documentation at least, should indicate no new data.p  pThanks in advance for any advicep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm talking about TCP sockets.  Specifically, sockets created with a call something like p  precodelistenfd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0 codepre  pthis is followed by what I believe is standard codep  precodebindlistenfd, struct sockaddrampservaddr, sizeofservaddr     listenlistenfd, 1 connfd  acceptlistenfd, struct sockaddrNULL, NULL codepre  pthen, the code to read from this new socketp  precodewhile 1     int n  recvconnfd, amppacket, sizeofpackett, MSGDONTWAIT     if n gt 0          ...examine packet...       codepre  pWith ONONBLOCK set or by providing the MSGDONTWAIT flag to recv, the read doesnt block.  Which is great.  However, what ends up happening is that it continually reads or receives I guess previous data until new data is available, which it will then begin to return over and over again.  The behavior Im looking for, which I thought from the documentation this would provide, is for recv calls made after data has been examined, but while no new data is yet available, to return an n value lt 0. p

Negative 717 pUsing Chromes developer tools, you can see what events that can be fired by the element have listeners attached. Inspect an element, find the Event Listeners tab in the right part of the developer tools window. When its added using some simple JS, clicking on the source link where its defined will usually take you to a lovely line of calling codeaddEventListenercode. When its added with jQuery however, youll probably end up at some minified jQuery blah that starts looking something like thisp  precodefunction e      var t  M[e]       return v.eache.splity, functione, n          t[n]  0     , t  codepre  pNow even if I were to look at the nonminified version of this code, it still wouldnt tell me where it was originally called to add the event listener.

Negative 717 pWere writing a web application in Flask  Jinja2 at work.  The application has registered users which can access certain pages based on their roles.

Negative 717 pSo I am trying to write an android app to control audio volumes music, notifcations, media, etc. I wanted to detect whether or not the ringer and notification volumes were linked. The reason for this is so that the two seek bars could be moved together if they are linked. I am writing the app for android 4.1 as an FYI. I could not find any APIs that could help with that.

Negative 717 pI am new to the Meteor framework.  I have found a lot of great info for modeling applications that use the database for primary functionality.p  pDoes it make sense to use Meteor for a project with no persistent local database needs aside from maybe managing user accountsp  pFor example lets say I want to make an app that allows people to enter a query.  My app would then query some particular remote DB asynchronously via its API and then update the page with whatever results were relevant.  I dont own this DB, Im just reading from it.p  pDoes Meteor have a part to play here  If so how do you integrate arbitrary asynch events with the Meteor page updating system that normally works automatically when MongoDB changes are madep  pAnyone know of an example of this sort of thing  Thanksp

Negative 717 pWhen we use 62.5 or 10px as the base unit in a wrapper or the body element then the child nodes can use em unit simpler.  However, the min font size of chrome being 12px makes the 62.5 design fail.  if we use 12px as the base unit, it makes the em calculation difficult.  The way I think of is using 20px as the base unit, then the em units in the inner nodes can be divided the original pixel size by 20. Whats the common approach to solve this problem in a responsive designp

Negative 717 pNot sure if this should be on here or something like codeServerFaultcode.p  pI frequently use my codehostscode file to redirect my Apache virtual hosts to codelocalhostcode so I can test them on my own machine.p  pMy school, NJIT, uses Cisco AnyConnect for its VPN. Its an older version, that doesnt seem to have support for my operating system Windows 8.1 but somehow it works, just so you know how old  it is.

Indeed, it looks like the login page that shows up whenever I use AnyConnect as a separate program. I suppose that means the VPN travels through that URL on its way to amp from the host computer.p  pWhat is this line for I havent recently updated Windows 8.1 or AnyConnect, amp I dont believe they have. Also, if I know what I am doing, is it OK to remove the line I assume AnyConnect will keep adding it, so how could I remove it for goodp

Negative 717 pI need to integrate our website in Joomla and quickbooks by importing the customer, invoice data from joomla site to Quickbooks. I am using Quickbooks pro 2014 on windows machine. I see there is QuickBooks PHP DevKit available by ConsoliBYTE.  By searching on stackoverflow, I see people have used this toolkit to perform the data importcustomer creation into QuickBooks. I need to know what all Quickbooks functionality can be achieved using this php toolkit. That is what it can and cannot do.  Is it build on QB SDK p  pFor example I have scenario where I need to import customers and need to add them as customer jobs. So does phpdevkit supports job creation If yes then how do I find the xml for that in phpdevkit quickbooks library So probably there will be more such similar requirements coming from end user in future and I need to consider these  facts while designing the solution using php toolkit. I do not want a solution which is limited to only few or specific functionality. I have read the QB SDK and it is mentioned that SDK can be used with .NET, java. both solution goes with webconnector. SDK can perform almost all the functions as supported in quickbooks UI. So I am confused which one I should pick PHP toolkit by ConsoliByte or .NetJava based. Language is not a concern for me. My aim is to look for solution flexible and capable to cover maximum QB functionality which includes customer creation, invoice creation, adding customer job and updating the customerinvoice on every synchup as well as limitation which the solution poses must be known before implementation. So along with what QuickBooks PHP DevKit can or cannot do, I need to know its difference from Java.Net based QB SDK Not language PHP or VB.NETJava but core framework I tried searching it over stackoverflow and google but could not found this information. I appreciate any inputs shared.p  pThanks, Amitp

Negative 717 pI have multiple dataset as below, and I want to handle them using PHP.p  precodeDataset 1 75 cols  27,000 rows           col 1 col 2 ... record 1 record 2 ...  Dataset 2 32 cols  7,500 rows ....  Dataset 3 44 cols  17,500 rows .... codepre  pHere, the number of records and columns are strongdifferentstrong so it is hard to use database structure. And note that each cell of dataset is only consists of either real number or NA... and the dataset is perfectly strongfixedstrong, i.e., there will be no any change.p  pSo what Ive done so far is make them as a filebased table, and write a starting offset of each record in the file. Using this way, quite nice access speedup was achieved, but not satisfactory so far, because an access to each record requires emparsing it as PHP data structureem.p  pWhat I ultimately want to achieve is eliminating the parsing step. But emserializationem was not a good choice because it loads strongentire datasetstrong. Of course it is possible to serialize each record and keep their offset as Ive done but without serialization, but it seems me to not so emfancyem.p  pSo heres the question, is there any method to load a part of dataset emwithoutem any parsing step, but more better than the partial serialization what I suggestedp  pMany thanks in advance.p  ul liMore informationli ul  pMaybe I made the viewers a little bit confused. Each dataset is strongseparatedstrong and they exist as independent files.p  pUsual data access pattern is rowwise. Each row have unique ID by string, and an ID in one dataset could be exists in other dataset, but not necessarily. But above of that, what I concern is accelerating an access speed when I have some query to fetch specific rows in the dataset. For example, let there is a dataset like below.p  precodeDataset 1 plaintext file      obs1  obs2  obs3  ... my1  3.72  5.28  10.22 ... xu1  3.44  5.82  15.33 ... ... qq7  8.24  10.22 47.54 ... codepre  pAnd there is a corresponding index file, serialized using PHP. A key of each item represents unique ID in the dataset, and their value represents their offset in the filep  precodeIndex 1 PHPserialized one, not same as actual serialized one Array    my1 gt 0,   xu1 gt 337,   ...   qq7 gt 271104  codepre  pSo it is possible to know record xu1 starts at 337 bytes from the beginning of dataset file. In order to access and fetch some rows using their unique ID,p  precode1 Load serialized index file 2 Find matching IDs with query 3 Access to those position and fetch rows, and parsing them as an array of PHP. codepre  pThe problems what I have isp  precode1 Since I using exact matching, it is impossible to fetch multiple rows that partially matching with query for example, fetch xu1 row from query xu 2 Even though I indexed dataset, fetch speed is not satisfactory took 0.05 sec. from single query 3 When I tried to solve above problem by serializing an entire dataset, maybe of course the loading speed become substantially slower. codepre  pThe only easiest way to solve above problems is make them as database I would do so, but hope to find better way as keep them with plain text or some textlike format for example, serialized or jsoncoded.p  pMany thanks and interests about my problemp

Negative 717 pI am trying to create a generic codeInsertltTgtcode for our objects. I am new to OrmLite so I am still reading up on it. The objects that are used do not use an codeIdcode property they have a more detailed name.p  pAs an example this a basic POCOp  precodepublic class Customer      public int CustomerId  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      ...etc.   codepre  pSo the primary key is codeCustomerIdcode and through some more reading I found that OrmLite likes to use the property codeIdcode for the primary keys. As we have a convention not to use just the name codeIdcode for the FK I cannot switch. However reading further it seemed like I could decorate the property with an attribute or two and get it to work. p  pThis is what I am working withp  precodepublic class Customer      [AutoIncrement]     [AliasCustomerId]     public int Id  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      ...  codepre  pI get a codeSqlExceptioncode stating the followingp  blockquote   pAdditional information Cannot insert the value NULL into column CustomerId,    table XXX.dbo.Customer column does not allow nulls. INSERT failsp blockquote  pI did some more reading and thought I could fix the issue by inheriting from an interface.p  precodepublic class Customer  IHasIdltintgt      [AutoIncrement]     [AliasCustomerId]     public int Id  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      ...  codepre  pI have played with using the codePrimaryKeycode attribute and I still get the same result. p  pHas anyone had an issue like this If you did how did you solve it I am having a hard time finding some more information on the matter. p  pI can get rid of the attributes and name the property back to CustomerId so it matches the db table and it will insert into the table but it will always put in 0 as the key, which makes sense just because it is the default value for the int but does not help me when it has to be an autoincrementing primary key. As a side note I am using codeServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServer.3.9.71code and SQL Server 2008p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pSo I went through the documentation again today for 3.9 version of ServiceStack.OrmLite and read through their description on what I should do when I dont have POCOs with an Id property for the Primary Key. It is as followsp  blockquote   p... by convention OrmLite expects it to be Id although you can use         [AlaisDbFieldName] attribute to map it to a column with a different name or use the [PrimaryKey] attribute to tell OrmLite to use a different property for the primary key.p blockquote  pI used both of the examples and it does in fact insert my data to the SQLDatabase. However, it is still inserting 0 for the CustomerId primary key. p  pIf I use the AutoIncrement attribute it throws a SqlExceptionp  blockquote   pAn exception of type System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException occured in System.Data.dll but was not handled by user code.

Negative 717 pI made a fully functional website in Visual Studio 2010 with a very simple threetable database as a final project for an undergraduate course in ASP. There is also a database called ASPNETDB.MDF that was generated when I created a login page for the admin section of the website. Both of these databases are stored in a folder called AppData. When I run the site in debugging mode everything runs fine. I decided to upload the project to a hosting account I have with GoDaddy, and quickly learned that GoDaddy uses a separate server to host databases. p  pThe first thing I did was create empty databases from the hosting menu using both the MySQL tool via phpMyAdmin and the SQL Server tool via the Admin Tool as I wasnt sure which one I was supposed to be using. Neither options allow me to import MDF files, and I would like to import the tables, relationships, and schemas all in one go. From my understanding CSV files only contain table data, so I avoided that route. I then tried to connect to both servers using Visual Studio, but I was unable to do so. I may have been doing this wrong. I opened the Server Explorer, rightclicked the Servers section, clicked Add Server, and entered the IP of the SQL server expecting a username and password prompt. Instead it returned that it could not find the server.p  pNext I rightclicked the database and clicked Publish to Provider. I again tried entering the information for the SQL server but was unable to establish a connection. I finally tried saving the SQL script to my desktop, but I dont know where to go on phpMyAdmin or the other admin tool to run the script.p  pIm sure the solution is fairly obvious, but this is my first time doing this and I am very confused. Im aware that once I finally get my two databases uploaded I need to change the connection strings in my web.config file. Im hoping once I get the databases uploaded and change the connection strings everything will run smoothly, but right now my primary concern is getting my databases uploaded to GoDaddys SQL server. Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated. Have a great dayp

JMeter tests are being ran to test concurrency.  As concurrency increases I am also seeing response times increase in a linear growth rate.  The result is that the application can only handle a small concurrency level.p  pXDebug has been used to profile the application code which uses a third party framework however, other than decreasing the application response time per request there is no solid explanation for the steady response time increase with concurrency.p  pCPU usage is under 60 and load average is low.

Negative 717 pDo Swift classes have something like an isa pointer that can be remapped p  pWeve seen that Swift a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma24020950404201uses a more static method dispatcha than objectiveC, which unless a class dervices from FoundationNSObject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime.p  pIm wondering how well implement method interceptionbased dynamic features like the observer pattern, notifications, etc Currently all this stuff is provided by the ObjectiveC layer, and can be easily integrated into Swift. But, if we want to provide these kinds of features in a framework or app of our own, is it necessary to implement them in ObjectiveC I would assume theres a way to do it natively. p  pAnother kind of swizzling common to objectiveC is remapping the isapointer to generate a subclass on the fly.

Negative 717 pIs it possible to create a selfsigned X.509 certificate in Android without using any thirdparty libraries If no, is there any way to demonstrate this inability to an employer  an article on the subject, a publication to that effect, etc.p  pstrongEditstrong First, thanks for trying to help. However, I too have taken a course on the theory of computation in university. I am not asking if this is theoretically possible, but if this is easily doable using available, non3rdparty libraries. I know I can generate a keypair using those, but what about a certificatep  pstrongEditstrong Please also understand that I am not the boss. To convince the boss to integrate a new external suite, I should demonstrate its necessity by proving that it would be too hard to do it without it.p

The slope feature is a value of either 0 or 1 based on the parameter you select which works, Ive debugged it and made sure theres no errors. The issue comes with the highpass and bandpass filters. The low pass works fine and returns the correct value buf3 which results in a 24dB filter.p  pThe other two, however, seem to be backwards. When slope is set to 24db slope  1 for highpass amp bandpass, even though its returning the appropriate value inputvalue  buf3, for example i am still getting what seems to be a 12dB slope determined by checking frequency via analyzer amp you can tell by the sound produced. I cant seem to figure out where the error is.p  pAnother issue I am having is really annoying aliasing, ie, when i set the lowpass filter to a low cutoff, there are still some high frequencies passing through amp you can hear the sound oscillating or something.

Are there any recommendations for something inbetweenp  pI realize that there is no code in my question, but I imagine that this is a coding prerequisite if you want an application that performs well and allows you to have a smaller footprint less memory and less expensive CPU, which is what programmers should seek.p

Negative 717 pI have a few hundred lines of javascript code that is only going to be used on a single page. However, I am unsure if I should put the code into an external .js file or keep it in a  tag.

Ideally I would like a technique that wouldnt ask me to implement forward shading to use for translucent objects.p  pThere are a number of cases where I need to use transparencyp  ul liGrassHair antialiased cutoutsli liGlass colorful blendingli liObjects that fade in and outli liSmokeCloudsli liWaterLiquid would involve refraction, I know that true OIT is impossible hereli liSparksMagicFire dont need to be lit and can use additive blending, not worried about theseli ul  pI am willing to sacrifice image correctness for the sake of speed Hence my initial choice of weighted average blending.  I dont need every layer of translucent objects to be lit, but I would at least like for the frontmost pixels to be properly lit.p  pIm using OpenGL 3.x Core Context, so I would like to avoid anything that requires OpenGL 4.x as lovely as it would be to use, but I can freely use anything that isnt available in OpenGL 2.x.p  pMy question is  What is the best orderindependent transparency technique for deferred shading, andor what is the best way to lightshade a translucent object when using deferred shadingp  pP.S. is there a better way to render antialiased cutouts grasshairleaves that doesnt rely on blending  Pure alpha testing tends to produce ugly aliasing.p

Negative 717 pI have an object that incorporates an event which is created in my programspecifically, a session based ni daq with a DataAvailable event which fires every time a set number of samples is acquired. This event will be fired at random times during the course of running my program that will do other stuff independent of recording. When fired, it will collect and save the data chunk in a file.p  pMy issue is that everytime the Event is triggered, i need to increase a counter i name it chunk in my original program.

Negative 717 pGood Morning,p  pI want to store emsamplesem in a emBufferem. To facilitate future modifications as well as memorymanagement, I would like to use a struct.

However, my Problem is that I also want to change the size of the arrays. I would like to initialise emMAXSAMPLESem, emNUMVAR3em, and emNUMVAR4em at the beginning of my program and not have them hardcoded. Thus after initialisation would still be a emstaticem problem which is easy to handle.

Negative 717 pI have a Raspberry Pi with a GPIO display.  I currently have it set up as a framebuffer device at devfb1.  Is there a way to make it my default or primary display for X windows  Im ultimately trying to draw graphics to it, I was originally planning on using DirectFB and SDL, but DirectFB is in alpha for the pi.  Ive tried using SDL1.2 as well since it has Framebuffer support, but I cant figure out how to get SDL to choose a framebuffer device to draw to without using DirectFB.p  pI considered using SDL to prepare each frame of my simple GUI as a raw image and use mmap to blit it to devfb1 instead of using SDLs built in draw functions, but I feel like this is a poor way to achieve my goal.  p  pI think that if I can get xorg to use my framebuffer device as the primary monitor, I wouldnt have to worry about doing anything special to have SDL draw my image files.

Negative 717 pIm using an oozie java action step to start a java main.  This java application does some calculations and then runs another mapreduce job based on that data. Since the oozie java action runs as a maponly job, it is also seen in job tracker.p  pOne of our nodes was low on memory so the task tracker killed the oozie maponly job and restarted it on another node.  However before killing it, the java application had already spawned its own map reduce job.  When the oozie maponly job was restarted on the other node, it again spawned yet another mapreduce job with the same data as the former one. Looking in job tracker now has duplicate mapreduce jobs running against the same data.p  pHow do you preventmanagealter settings such that the java program that oozie initiates in the maponly process only get run once, or is it necessary to have to constrain the Java application to be able to be run multiple times.p  pAny help would be appreciated,p  pKenp

Negative 717 pI have a Grails 2.3.8 application which runs on an Amazon EC2 instance and uses MongoDb 2.6.1 running on the same EC2 instance. When I configured an SSL certificate on an AWS load balancer and put the EC2 instance under the load balancer, I started having problems.p  pI can log into my application and the first few db accesses are fine, then it starts to behave weird and freezes during db accesses. It fails every time but at different points. First maybe on the 2nd db access then I log out and log back in and can make it to say the 3rd access before it fails. It varies on each retry.p  pstrongObservation 1strong If I run the Grails application on my local machine localhost and point it to the MongoDb on EC2 using the EC2s ip address in my DataSource.groovy it works perfectly.p  pstrongObservation 2strong If I run the Grails application and MongoDb locally on my machine it still works perfectly.p  pemThe trouble starts when the Grails application AND MongoDb are on the same AWS EC2 machine and it only started after the EC2 was placed under the load balancer.emp  pWhile the EC2 is under the load balancer, when both the application and MongoDb are running on the EC2 instance, I have this issue whether I tell my Grails application to look for MongoDb at localhost or by the EC2 instances ip address or even if I try to point the Grails application to MongoDB via the load balancers DNS name being used in my DataSource.groovy. I tried adding the EC2 instances security group to the load balancer but that didnt help either. p  pIt seems like an access problem of some sort between my application and MongoDb only when they are both running on the same EC2 instance and the instance is under the load balancer. I am thinking something about the load balancer is awry because now, even when I run my Grails application on the EC2 instance in development mode outside of tomcat7 via codegrails runappcode, I still have the same issues trying to access the MongoDb on the EC2, I run into errors where property id is null on some objects. These problems dont occur when I run the same code on my local machine whether talking to MongoDB on AWS or on my local machine.p  pI have even tried different session stickiness settings on the AWS load balancer to no avail.p  pemMy problem also seems to go away when I remove my EC2 instance from being under the load balancer. At that point I have none of the above said issues.emp  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 717 pTo give you some background this is a C Windows Universal app, which was initially developed for the Windows Tablet but with Windows Phone in mind, at a later date.

Negative 717 pMy page is a list of items with one image per item. The whole list is in the html code, but all the items are hidden by default with displaynone in the CSS file, and a javascript file permits to display them with pagination.

Negative 717 pI have an object containing cyclic references. According to the XStream Json documentation, cyclic references are NOT supported, and one should therefore use a hrefhttpxstream.codehaus.orggraphs.html relnofollowthe NOREFERENCES XStream modea when marshalling an object to Jsonp  blockquote   pWhat limitations has XStreams JSON supportp      pJSON represents a very simple data model for easy data transfer.   Especially it has no equivalent for XML attributes. Those are written   with a leading  character, but this is not always possible without   violating the syntax e.g. for array types. Those may silently   dropped and makes it therefore difficult to implement   deserialization. References are another issue in the serialized   object graph, since JSON has no possibility to express such a   construct. You should therefore always set the NOREFERENCES mode of   XStream. Additionally you cannot use implicit collections, since the   properties in a JSON object must have unique names.p blockquote  pBut I tried setting the mode to IDREFERENCES and it appears as though the Object is marshalled emwithem references, and the object can be unmarshalled properly. Is the XStream documentation simply outdated, or have I simply inadvertently created the object graph in such a way that I havent hit any of the limitationsp  pSorry, but I cant post my exact graph as an example as it contains applicationdomainspecific code and it might take some time to construct a clean alternative.p

I have tried just building the array independantly and then setting the valueAccessors value to the array directly but the ui does not respond, it only works by pushing the items.p  pHow can I get around this Am I doing the binding correctly or is there a better more appropriate way I have marked the line of code with a comment to indicate where my problem is happening.p  precodemultiSelectCheck          init function element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel, bindingContext               This will be called when the binding is first applied to an element              Set up any initial state, event handlers, etc. here             var bindings  allBindingsAccessor             var ddOptions  unwrapvalueAccessor             var selectedOptions  unwrapbindings.selectedOptions             var options  unwrapbindings.multiselectOptions  []             var optionsCaption  unwrapbindings.optionsCaption             var displaySelected  unwrapbindings.selectedList  5             var loadingCaption  unwrapbindings.loadingCaption             var delimiter  unwrapbindings.splitSelectedBy  ,             var setInitial  unwrapbindings.setInitialValue               display loader in dropdown             ko.computedfunction                   if unwrapbindings.loading                      var spinnerClass  fa faspinner faspin falg                     var spinner  loadingCaption  ltspangtlti class  spinnerClass  gtltigt Loading...ltspangt                       set text to loading                     element.multiselect selectedList 0, noneSelectedText spinner, selectedText spinner .multiselectdisable                     element.multiselectrefresh                              , null,  disposeWhenNodeIsRemoved element                internal options             var internal   selectedList displaySelected, noneSelectedText Select options, selectedText  selected                merge options with provided options             options  .extendinternal, options               pass the original optionsCaption to the similar widget option             if optionsCaption                  options.noneSelectedText  unwrapoptionsCaption                            remove this and use the widgets             bindings.optionsCaption                 populate intitial values if available             if ddOptions ampamp ddOptions.length ampamp setInitial                   if selectedOptions                        create array from value                     if typeof selectedOptions  string                          selectedOptions  selectedOptions.splitdelimiter                         selectedOptions  selectedOptions.filterfunction e  return e   filter empty nodes                         bindings.selectedOptionsselectedOptions                                            add options objects to array of available options                     for var i  0 i lt selectedOptions.length i                          var item   Value selectedOptions[i], Text                           console.logitem                           THIS IS THE LINE OF CODE IN QUESTION                          unwrapvalueAccessor.pushitem                                                                  apply multiselect plugin             var elm  element.multiselectoptions.multiselectfilter filterOnly true, autoReset true                refresh the plugin             element.multiselectrefresh              ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallbackelement, function                   elm.multiselectfilterdestroy.multiselectdestroy                 element.remove                       ,         update function element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel, bindingContext               This will be called once when the binding is first applied to an element,              and again whenever the associated observable changes value.

Negative 717 pBasic requirement is Server has data with GMT 00.00 and Browser needs to request data from server between certain datesnot time.

Negative 717 pI have two SpringBoot applications where Im using RabbitMQ to communicate messages across a queue.  One application is built to send messages and the other listens for the sent messages.  Each application consists of an SpringBootApplication file which has one Autowired dependency at the attribute level one application has the sender the other has the listener and each application has a separate Spring Configuration file which declares one bean each one has the sender and one has the receiver.  p  pFor some reason, the Sender application has no issue with the injection, however, the Receiver application is not injecting at the Autowire even though the bean is in my application context.  Im using the sample app as a means of demonstrating RabbitMQSpringAMQP with SpringBoot and microservices to our company.  Below is the code of the Sender Application followed by the Receiver Application.

Negative 717 pI want to develop the clientserver application with authorization and authentication as security is very important for this application.

Ok, I connected using SSL to glassfish. But, what confuses me is that on client side I get all jndi registry via initialcontext.

Negative 717 pI have a math question which I try to solve with a Delphi function. I am trying to split up an integer into nearly equal pieces.

I think a pure CSS solution may be impossible but Im hoping someone can prove otherwise.p  pbTo clarify,b the end result should be that codeltmyelgtcode behaves like an inlinereplaced element itself, as if it were an codeltimggtcode with its own internal dimensions. When you dont set width or height on those elements, they default to their internal dimensions.

Negative 717 pIm essentially trying to replicate the behavior of the graph on a hrefhttpswww.mathsisfun.comalgebratriginteractiveunitcircle.html relnofollow titlethisthisa site in a Shiny app.p  pThat is, I want to create an interactive graph, where by hovering the mouse cursor over the graph, you move a targeting line along the xaxis. Then, according to the position of the targeting line, the yvalues of the plot lines on the graph are displayed on the intersection point of the targeting line and the plot lines. I was going to post an illustrative figure, but it appears I dont have enough reputation for that yet.p  pIve managed to get the application to work. In my current implementation Im using the codehovercode option in codeplotOutputcode to get the location of the cursor on the plot, and then adding a targeting line using codeablinecode to a new plot. Along with codepointscode and codetextcode to add the yvalues on the plot. p  pThe issue Im having is that the targeting line starts to severely lag behind the actual mouse cursor after moving around for a while. I think this is due to having to redraw the entire plot every time the mouse hovering position updates currently every 500 ms when the cursor is moving, since Im using codehoverOptsdelayType  throttlecode. The rendering just isnt fast enough to keep up with the mouse movement.

Negative 717 pIn previous versions of iOS it was possible to create an instance of codeNSMetadataItemcode by calling codeinitURL url NSURLcode. This allowed you to create an instance that pointed to any file you had access to.p  pIn iOS 9 this no longer exists and the URL property is read only so there is no way to set it after the fact. It no longer shows in the header for codeNSMetadataItemcode and Xcode says it is unavailable when used.p  pIs there some alternate way to create instances of codeNSMetadataItemcode with a specific URL or is it now only something we get passed in query results p  pI ask because I want to use codeNSMetadataItemcodes for both iCloud emandem local documents and there is no query option to read the local documents to get them that way. It seems needlessly complicated to have two totally different ways of dealing with documents that are only stored locally versus those that are stored in iCloud.p  pEdit After looking more closely I see that codeinitURL url NSURLcode is only OS X and was never on iOS despite the fact that it is a Foundation class. The question still stands however as to how in the world is one to create an codeNSMetadataItemcode attached to a specific URL without this connivence function.p
Negative 717 pI have an intriguing problem that I thought I resolved with a janky solution, but I only half solved it. Im using Datatables for Jquery and Im loading in data from a database to populate the table. p  pI should note that been developing using Firefox. p  pAdditionally, I have a horizontal scroll bar and the first five columns are fixed. This poses a problem because before all of the data is loaded, the datatable puts in a horizontal scroll bar. Some of the data loaded after the scroll bar is initialized is longer in length and thus makes the column widths larger. p  pTo resolve this, I just call a resizep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt setTimeoutfunction     window.dispatchEventnew Eventresize ,2000 ltscriptgt codepre  pWhat happens here is I see the page load, the table is initially messed up, but after a brief delay a little less that 2 seconds as it should be because of the time Ive given to the timeout, the table fixes itself because of the window resize. p  pI thought the problem was fixed, until I began testing in Chrome. The table will be initially messed up, just as it is in Firefox, but once the resize is called, the table extends horizontally, loses the horizontal scroll bar, and the chrome window gets one. Thats not ideal because the point of the scroll bar is to keep the table within the width of the screen size. p  pTo contain the width of the table, I use the following CSSp  precodediv.dataTableswrapper     width 96vw     margin 0 auto  codepre  pI define the table like so.p  precodedocument.readyfunction      example.dataTable          scrollX true          new .fn.dataTable.FixedColumnsexample,     leftColumns5  codepre  pAny help is appreciated. p
Negative 717 pIm developing a search engine inside angular view and I was wondering if search engine is used too many times and the user does not leave the search engines view, how should I do to avoid the problem of overloading scopep  pWhen I carry out a lot of searches, I can notice the view is slower. I think this problem is caused by scope overload, but Im not sure.p  pAn example If I get the results of a request into codescope.variable1code and after I make another request again and overwrite codescope.variable1.code..what happen are watchers of data structure inside old codevariable1code removed automaticallyp  pIn summary, sometimes when I use too many times an angular views without leaving it the view is slowed down. Which is the best practice to deal with itp

Negative 717 pI am using the codecaretcode package to train models for a classification problem.

For instance, if there are NAs in the predictions of the model during CV, I might need to include a na.rm somewhere in my additional function. I think it is unclear without developerlevel knowledge of codecaretcode.p  pAlternatively, is there an easier way of doing this that I have overlookedp  pThanks for any help people can provide. Adamp
