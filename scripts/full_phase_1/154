Negative 154 pIt seems that most of the installers for Perl are centered around installing Perl modules, not applications.

Negative 154 pWhy is it that TCP connections to a loopback interface end up in codeTIMEWAITcode socket closed with codeSODONTLINGERcode set, but identical connections to a different host do not end up in codeTIMEWAITcode they are resetdestroyed immediatelyp  pHere are scenarios to illustratep  pA  Two applications, a client and a server, are both running on the same Windows machine.  The client connects to the server via the servers loopback interface 127.0.0.1, port xxxx, sends data, receives data, and closes the socket codeSODONTLINGERcode is set.p  pLets say that the connections are emveryem shortlived, so the client app is establishing and destroying a large number of connections each second.  The end result is that the sockets end up in codeTIMEWAITcode, and the client eventually exhausts its max number of sockets on Windows, this is 3900 by default, and we are assuming that this value will not be changed in the registry.p  pB  Same two applications as scenario A, but the server is on a different host the client is still running on Windows.  The connections are identical in every way, except that they are not destined for 127.0.0.1, but some other IP instead.  Here the connections on the client machine do NOT go into codeTIMEWAITcode, and the client app can continue to make connections indefinitely.p  pWhy the discrepancyp

Negative 154 pIm writing managed code that has to interact with a vendors COM automation server that runs out of process.  I have found that this server becomes unstable if more than one client connects to it.  For example, if I have managed code in process A and managed code in process B both connecting to this COM server, a single process will be spun up for the COM server and  its behavior is less than reliable.  strongIm hoping theres a way to force a separate process for each client  server connectionstrong.  Ideally, Id like to end up withp  pManaged Process A talking to COM Server in process bC1bbr Managed Process B talking to COM Server in process bC2bp  pOne thought that came to mind was that if I ran process A and process B with different security identities, that that might cause the COM infrastructure to create separate server processes.  Id rather not go down that road, however.  Managed Process A and Managed Process B are actually Windows Services.  And Im running them with identity Local System because I need them to be able to interact with the desktop, and you cant check the Interact with Desktop box on the services applet for services that dont run as Local System.  And the reason I need to interact with desktop is that this COM server occasionally throws up a dialog box on the screen and if the service itself cannot interact with the desktop then the COM server is spawns cant display the dialog I believe it is displayed on a hidden WinStation.p

We have found a opportunity that the Long Tail really describes well. By this i mean a product range that isnt currently being tapped into online. As with Amazon, our model is about offering every available product within the niche. Through the availability of everything outside the fast selling products, we hope to become best website for the niche. p  pWe have placed a lot of focus on building the businesstechnology system that allows us to build our inventory information very quickly. This was because we knew that the size of our inventory would make or break our usefulness to end users.p  pSo now i come to the problem that prompted me to seek your help.... please help... p  pIn my nontechnical business mind, we now have the ability to build our inventory quickly. This is just the start though, as a business we also need the following solutions before making moneyp  ul liA shopping cart application tobr  allow buyers to search our inventory, communicate with our business andbr  make orders etc. li liA CRM application would then allow the effective management of customers and orders.li ul  pI found my way to Magento and SugarCRM both of which appear to be very impressive. The idea being to use Magento for the buyers search,buy,interact etc and Sugar for our staff order processing, customer service etc. p  pIn my mind the long term rewards of being able to update these core applications from the communities, would far outweigh the steep learning curve. Not to mention the timemoney that would be required to even attempt to catch up with what already is stable and tested....p  pMy friend and business partner is unwilling to consider anything in PHP and to a large degree opensource. Hes of the belief it would be best to start from scratch. p  pFrom a language agnostic business person nonprogrammer  any opinions or advise on our situation would be much appreciated...p  pIm keen to find a way of us unlocking horns, either way... I just struggle to see any strong value in Reinventing the wheel....p  pThanks in advance, Guyp  pThanks for the replies so far and the link, ill go there in a minute. Heres some answersp  pOur stock is currently held across 30 different branches. Which means that wed need a way for each branch to sign in and manage their own customers. p  pFrom our operational point of view, these seem to be the key challenges outside standard p  p1 Our business has regions and each region has branches. In order for us to focus the various management levels of the business, it would be ideal if each management level could see the business relevant to them. For example National manager can see everything, Regional manager can see all branches in his region, Branch manager can see everything for his branch with certain admin rights and Customer service can see everything in their branch with minimal rights. This is the only way we can have one umbrella site, which can be serviced by staff in branches nationally. p  p2 Over and above managing orders, it also makes sense that the messages are managed centrally through the application. This way any member of staff can easily see the past history with the customer and assist. Im thinking that the questions would almost always come in through Ask a question about this product link, so incoming messages could be routed to the branch who has the part. If its aftersales, then the branch who sold it. For general questions through contact us, well allocate a member of staff at head office.p  p3 I think it would be appropriate to show buyers upfront on the product page which branch has the part and the branch information.p  p4 Total inventory size is currently over 300,000 products. The business plan is to rapidly increase this to 10 times that figure.p  p5 The products are spare parts. Therefore the buyer would need to search by the orignal product that the parts fits... Each part can often be used on various products. p

I found one question that said EF has issues with this, but if youre mapping table makes both columns a primary key, it works itself out. Im not sure how to do that. Is this done in the database using SQL SERVER 2005 EXPRESS or in the mapping This is a personal project so I can post more details about the code or xml if needed.

Negative 154 pI have one table codeGAMEScode and another codePLAYERScode. Currently each game has a column for codeplayersingamecode but I have nothing reciprocating in the codePLAYERScode table. Since this column is an array Comma separated list of the players ID s Im thinking that it would probably be better to have each players record also contain a list of the games they are a member of. On the other hand, duplicating the information in two separate tables might actually require more DB calls.p  pFor perspective, there arent likely to be more then a dozen players in a game generally 46 is the norm but there could potentially be a large number of games.p  pIs there a good way to figure out which would be more efficient Thanks.p

Negative 154 pBriefly Im making a custom view, I want a field listing the two taxonomy terms associated with an NID to output as two distinct links which return arguments for the view term1 to viewterm1, term2 to viewterm2. Rather, it outputs as one aggregated link both term1 and term2 output viewterm10Aterm2. p  pAm I doing something wrong or is this not possiblep  pExhaustivelyp  pI am constructing a view of products with the page output at a hrefhttpexample.comproducts relnofollowhttpexample.comproductsa in an drupal ubercart site because the builtin ubercart catalog psuedoview isnt doing it for me. Some of these products belong to more than one taxonomy term within the same vocabulary  for instance, productexample1 belongs to terms blue and glowinthedark, productexample2 red and glowinthedark, productexample3 just blue. p  pIve created an argument which limits the view based on terms like so productsred, productsglowinthedark etc returns this nice view I made but only with products which are associated with taxonomy terms red, glowinthedark, etc  so works as it should. Views is awesomep  pNow, I want each product shown in this view to link to the generated product[term] pages. Outputting the field taxonomyall terms as a link with replacement argument products[tid] works for one term productexample3s field works for its one term productsblue views is awesome , but, AND HERES THE PROBLEM, it DOESNT FOR TWO TERMS or I assume more than two terms. This is true whether the field is output as a list or using a simple seperator. So, for productexample one, the field lists both terms blue and glowinthedark correctly separated as list items or with the chosen , simple separator, but both terms output the relative link productsblue0Aglowinthedark.p  pIs that clear I havent been able to google anyone with a similar situation, strangely, although I cant imagine Im the first to run into this. I may just give up since its not all that important and I can think of several lesssatisfactory but still doable workarounds, but I thought you all might have some insight. The only thing that gives me hope is that when the Link this field to its term page check box is selected, views successfully outputs two separate line items with links to the two separate terms pages.p  pIm also posting this question on Drupal.org.

Negative 154 pOk, this is really difficult to confess, but I do have a strong temptation at the moment to inherit from codestdvectorcode. p  pI need about 10 customized algorithms for vector and I want them to be directly members of the vector. But naturally I want also to have the rest of codestdvectorcodes interface. Well, my first idea, as a lawabiding citizen, was to have an codestdvectorcode member in codeMyVectorcode class. But then I would have to manually reprovide all of the stdvectors interface. Too much to type. Next, I thought about private inheritance, so that instead of reproviding methods I would write a bunch of codeusing stdvectormembercodes in the public section. This is tedious too actually. p  pAnd here I am, I really do think that I can simply inherit publicly from codestdvectorcode, but provide a warning in the documentation that this class should not be used polymorphically. I think most developers are competent enough to understand that this shouldnt be used polymorphically anyway.p  pIs my decision absolutely unjustifiable If so, why Can you provide an alternative which would have the additional members strongactuallystrong members but would not involve retyping all of vectors interface I doubt it, but if you can, Ill just be happy.p  pAlso, apart from the fact that some idiot can write something likep  precodestdvectorltintgt p   new MyVector codepre  pis there any other strongemrealisticemstrong peril in using MyVector By saying realistic I discard things like imagine a function which takes a pointer to vector ...p  pWell, Ive stated my case.

Negative 154 pIve found a pretty intricate problem while working on a project with multiple EE deployables. The problem seems to be a confluence of the EJB3.1 TimerServices Hibernate dependencies and insufficient classloader isolation.p  pStarting with a stock AS 6 CR1 build, I deploy a WAR. This WAR contains Hibernate jars.p  pThen, I deploy an EJB technically an MDB in a JAR. When I do so, JBoss then starts up the TimerService, in order to provide full EJB3.1 support. The TimerService depends on Hibernate. JBoss then goes on strike, because the classloader detects an already loaded version of Hibernate.p  pIve even tried packaging each of these up into a separate EAR and deploying them. No dice. Something about the way the TimerService is being loaded seems to totally ignore classloading isolation.p  pMy question is, is there anything I can do about it, short of disabling the TimerService I was intending to make use of its nifty features later in the project. I honestly dont even know if this is a bug, as the classloader documentation for JBoss seems to have been written by angry Klingons. Still, I hope for a workaround.p  pstrongEDITstrong  In fact, I dont even have a way of disabling the TimerService, as each of my efforts has been thwarted in one way or another. As it stands, I dont see how anyone can deploy Hibernate and EJBs to the same JBoss instance.p  pstrongEDITstrong  I eventually managed to deploy by not including the Hibernate jars in my MDB or WAR, but to rely on JBoss Hibernate implementation. This is unsatisfying Im left with the feeling that theres no isolation between the container and my beans. But at least its a current version of Hibernate 3.6.p

To do so i created a file with contentp  precodequit[NEWLINE] codepre  pwhereby [NEWLINE stands for Unix endlines and windows style EOL]p  pusing following command windowsp  precodefsi.exe lt thefileDescribedAbove codepre  por respectively linuxp  precodefsharpi lt thefileDescribedAbove codepre  plike expected it works on Windows opens FSI and quits immediately but stalls on linux like  or NEWLINE is not received.

Negative 154 pIve been trying to find a emgenericem way to notify a UI control of changes in a list. For example, when an object is added to a list I want it added automatically to the listbox. If an object is removed from the list, I want it removed automatically from the listbox.p  pUnfortunately there are some maddening inconsistencies between Delphis lists TListlt.Notify is fine but TStringList.OnChange doesnt even tell you what the change was and TList doesnt even have any notification whatsoeverp  pI was hoping LiveBindings would give me a proper way of monitoring changes in most lists, but so far I dont see it. All the examples I have seen fills the control and sets up bindings between the list items and the control items listbox items in my example. But addingremoving an object from the list doesnt affect the control at all.p  pDoes anyone know of a mechanism that I have missed, or more generally, a nice generic way to do thisp  pstrongClarificationstrong It doesnt seem that I was clear enough before. The reason I need a generic way, is because I wrote a grid control that can connect to a variety of sources, including some existing code. I wrote an interface that the grid accepts as source and then a number of adapter classes to accept some lists and make them available as that interface. Since I needed to accept existing code as well, overriding TList.Notify is not an option. And since there is no event to see the changes, it effectively means TList does not have a notification mechanism that is usable by a client, such as my adapter class. TStrings doesnt have one either, but TStringList raises a simple OnChange, which means that the adapter class cannot actually determine what has changed.p  pI actually had a very nice solution that used the a hrefhttpblog.barrkel.com201009virtualmethodinterception.html relnofollowTVirtualMethodInterceptora, but that completely stopped working in Delphi XE and its not fixed in XE2.p

Negative 154 pIs there a way to code a rails partial such that it can only be rendered once, no matter how many times the containing view attempts to render itp  pstrongWhystrong A page consists of a series of smaller widget partials.  Each widget has a few small links in the upper right to display popover forms, which collect data from the user.  These popovers are partials included by the widget partials.  Clicking these links finds the popover partial in the DOM by id, displays it, and positions it below the clicked link.  The widget partials have no way of knowing which other widgets are included in this page, but I want to include each required popover once and only once in the DOM.p  pIf this is still confusing, the setup is something likep  ul liPage view ul liWidget partial 1 ul liPopover partial Ali ulli liWidget partial 2 ul liPopover partial Bli liPopover partial Cli ulli liWidget partial 3 ul liPopover partial Bli liPopover partial Dli ulli ulli ul  pHere A, B, C, and D should each appear only once in the DOM, despite B being explicitly included twice.p  pIm thinking something like codeifndefcode in C, where we ensure headers are included only once.p  pstrongNotestrong Im using Rails 2.3p

Negative 154 pI am very eager to learn in depth OOP concepts and most importantly how they can be applied in real life. So far, I have read many references and many tutorials online but they all lack something They do not provide a way to fully understand how object oriented programming can be truly used. In fact, it seems that most tutorial focus on OOP syntax as opposed to the art of OOP design. Since OOP is a set of conceptideabest practice in thinking about a problem and tackling that problem in a way to allow a better productivity I really want more. I want something to help me think as an OOP designer and not an OOP programmer. Can someone provide with me a resource preferably an online resource that actually provides a non trivial example on how to apply OOP Although I am aware that OOP is language agnostic, I would prefer examples in C. p

Negative 154 pThis is probably a fundamental question for an experienced iOS developer, but coming from a Java background where we have lots of Dependency Injection DI goodies i.e., Spring Im having some trouble figuring out who should own the DI objects.  Unfortunately, I find myself creating a bunch of Singletons which is becoming pretty nasty to manage.p  pFor instance, we have some codeConfigurationcode that other classes would like access to.  Currently we just have a singleton instance for Configuration, which makes testing a bit difficult.  Technically, we overcome this problem using method swizzling in OCMock.p  pIn JavaSpring, theres some container that createsowns these objects.  In iOS, I think the closest things I have to a container are UIApplication and UIApplicationDelegate.  Does it make sense for these things to createown these objects that will ultimately get injected into other objectsp  pIf so, what is an appropriate strategy to access these objects  For instance, create a category on UIApplication or UIApplicationDelegate to access these objects like code[[UIApplication sharedApplication] configuration]code or code[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] configuration]codep

I have a viewstack that contains 1 dropdown per stack. They share the same data provider. What I want to do is to select the item contents from the first one. Once I do that, when I click a button to the next stack I have a function that searches from index 0 to the dataprovider length and if the item from the first stack matches the second one, I want to have the second dropdown pick that item up and display it. I have it matching, and I try to select it, but when I run the application it shows up like nothing is selected. Here is what I havep  pedit I got it to work for a simple example, but when I attempt to use it in my more complicated example, on that button click it for some reason resets the value of selectedIndex to 1.

Negative 154 pits been a while since I have made one of my Converting MySQL to PostgreSQL posts.p  pSo, todays problem is as followsp  pThe original MySQL queries involve where clauses which look a bit like the followingp  precode WHERE id LIKE 6   OR createdtime LIKE 6   OR modifiedtime LIKE 6   OR startdate LIKE 6   OR enddate LIKE 6   OR screlatedto LIKE 6   OR trackingunit LIKE 6  OR message LIKE 6 codepre  pThis query is part of a system wide search. In this case, the system is searching for code6code, had I asked it to search for something else, like say the word codeusercode, instead of code6code, wed have codeusercode. p  pNow, the problem is that, the above datatypes are not always strings. Integer fields like codeidcode and datetime fields like codecreatedtimecode are being compared to strings. In MySQL, this seems to be okay, but grumpy PostgreSQL gets grumpy when it sees this query.p  pI know that for some fields, I can use the codetocharcode function, so, for example, part of the clause in PostgreSQL might look like thisp  precode tocharid, 999 LIKE 6  codepre  pUnfortunately, I cant just go throught the queries and add the codetocharcode to each applicable field because of the PHP backend. This is what the PHP code for generating the codeWHEREcode clause looks likep  precode where . tablename...columnname. LIKE . formatForSqlLikesearchval . codepre  pNote Its part of a loop, so the above line generates all of the individual comparisons. p  pSo, even if I can get around the type comparison with codetocharcode, I cant implement it because codetocharcode might need a specific 2nd parameter for a different datatype and even if I could use the same parameter for all datatypes, some of the datatypes would be strings, and passing a string to codetocharcode throws an error. p  pSo, I need a way to either get PHP to determine the column type and use the right codetocharcodeor dont use it at all accordingly or I need to get PostgreSQL to compare different datatypes.p  pThanks for all of your help, have a good dayp

For each week I will need to create empty templates for all the restaurants displaying the week number and dates. p  pI was also hoping for thirdparty developers to access this data through RESTful methods in the URL where the structure could be something like a hrefhttpdomain.norestaurantnamemenu relnofollowhttpdomain.norestaurantnamemenua for a textmenu a hrefhttpdomain.norestaurantnamejson relnofollowhttpdomain.norestaurantnamejsona for json etc.p  pI guess my question is how I can start developing such features.

Something more like this..p  precodeOData V2     d        results            metadata              uri httpsomeserverfoovendor1,             type Vendor         ,         MEPartNumber 11222234444,         MFGPartNumber 123456123,         MFGSerialNumber ABC123,          RONumber987654321,          VendorId1234567,          VendorName ACME SERVICE CENTER          codepre  pI suppose I could write a custom codeMediaTypeFormattercode to get the structure that I want. I might also be able to modify my returned objects to mimic the structure of the desired Json. Aside from these two options, does anyone know of a clever way to make WebAPI give me OData 2.0 formatted Json objectsp
Negative 154 pIm wondering about where events should be set in a parentchild relationship. Its not a specific problem, just a best practices I guess. My specific casep  pI have a codeDropdowncode which contains of a codeButtoncode and a codeListcode. Describing the action, you press the button and the list appears. You click an item in the list, and that item is selected and the list disappears.p  pSo the first thing is that since the view is initialized as a codeDropdowncode, the person making it shouldnt need to reach in and deal with the codeButtoncode or codeListcode view. All methods should be called on the parent view, and events might need to be bubbled up from the child.p  pSo for example, instead of doing codethis.dropdown.button.presscode, codeDropdowncode provides its own codepresscode method which just calls codeButtoncodes press method.p  pWhen the user presses the button, codeButtoncode fires a codepresscode event that codeDropdowncode is listening to.p  precodeonButtonPress  function        if this.isExpanded          this.expand           this.triggerpress , codepre  pAnd codeDropdowncode triggers press on itself, so that developer can get the press event without reaching in to codedropdown.buttoncode.p  pHeres where the first question comes. Should codeDropdowncode expand itself in codeonButtonPresscode or should codeonButtonPresscode just trigger a press, and then have the expansion listening on codeDropdowncodes own codepresscode eventp  precodeonButtonPress  function        this.triggerpress ,  onPress  function        if this.isExpanded          this.expand      , codepre  pAnd then it gets more complicated, should codeDropdowncodes codeexpandcode method just trigger codeexpandcode on itselfp  precodeexpand  function        if this.isEnabled           this.setStateexpanded, true          this.triggerexpand           return this ,  onExpand  function        this.list.show , codepre  por should it be the one that codeshowcodes the codeListcodep  precodeexpand  function        if this.isEnabled           this.setStateexpanded, true          this.list.show          this.triggerexpand           return this , codepre  pI guess Im just wondering about best practices for deciding where to bind events in a parentchild relationship. How to avoid confusing situations and possibly circular event calling.p  pAnyone have any thoughtsp

Negative 154 pIve just upgraded our Json.NET from version 3.5 Release 7 to 4.0 Release 8, and realized that seralization isnt done in the same way. When serializing an object that contains a standard Dictionary the 3.5 version left the dictionary keys unchanged, but when using 4.0, the contract resolver applies to the keys as well.p  pFor example, when using the following JsonSerializerSettingsp  precodejsonSerializerSettings  new JsonSerializerSettings      Converters  new ListltJsonConvertergt  new JavaScriptDateTimeConverter ,     NullValueHandling  NullValueHandling.Ignore,     ReferenceLoopHandling  ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore,     ContractResolver  new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver  codepre  pand when serializing an object like this onep  precode[JsonObjectMemberSerialization.OptOut] public class ProductFilter      public int Id  get set      public int NodeId  get set      public IDictionaryltstring, ProductFilterAttributegt Attributes  get set   codepre  pthe keys in the codeAttributescode dictionary becomes camelCase as well. In version 3.5R7 those where left unchanged and I think thats the correct way.p  pExample snippet from 3.5R7 outputp  precode     id 98659,     nodeId 317970,     attributes          FULLTIMEUSE              values [  1  ],             formattedValue ... codepre  pExample snippet from 4.0R8 outputp  precode     id 98659,     nodeId 317970,     attributes          fULLTIMEUSE              values [  1  ],             formattedValue ... codepre  pWe have a lot of similar code, so removing the camelCase resolving and adding code[JsonPropertyid]code, code[JsonPropertynodeId]code etc isnt really an option herep  pAny ideas of how to solve thisp

Currently, when an update is available, our customers have to download the new software bundle from our website and install it manually. This means on Windows, they have to launch a setup, on OS X and Linux to extract a tar.gz file. It usually is no big deal, but we want to streamline this process nonetheless.p  pBefore we start to reinvent the wheel, I want to know whether there already are solutions available which could perform the right steps platformspecifically. Something like Java Web Start but with much more control over it and no need to have it installed on the system. I know that OSGi platforms like Apache Felix can do that, but I rate them as overkill.p
Negative 154 pI have gone through the link  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2826029passingadditionalvariablesfromcommandlinetomakePassing additional variables from command line to makea.p  pI have a project which compiles both on Linux and Windows using makefiles. In Windows it uses gcc while in Linux it uses the ARM version of codegcccode ie  codearmv7linuxgcccode. I would like to use a command line variable which tells the makefile which compiler to use depending on Windows or Linux.p  pFor example in Windows it should have something like thisp  precodeCC gcc   CFLAGS c D COMPILEFORWINDOWS codepre  pand for Linuxp  precodeCC   armv7linuxgcc   CFLAGS  c D COMPILEFORLINUX codepre  pThese preprocessor defines COMPILEFORWINDOWS and COMPILEFORLINUX are present in the code base and cant be changed.p  pAlso for make clean it should clean up both for Windows and Linux.

Negative 154 pIm using strongappendChildstrong JavaScript method to move objects across DOM. Didnt have any problem until some user has complained that drag and drop doesnt work in strongSafari Mobilestrong after DIV element is dropped to the table. Here is REDIPS.drag library that Im developing a hrefhttpwww.redips.netjavascriptdraganddroptablecontent relnofollowhttpwww.redips.netjavascriptdraganddroptablecontentap  pIn a moment of dropping DIV element, DIV element is appended to the current table cell by appendChild method. It should be automatically removed from previous node to the current node. In documentation a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMelement.appendChild relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMelement.appendChilda is nothing written about attached event listeners to the object that is moved. I assume that event listeners attached to the object in traditional and advanced model should travel together with object and not to be removed.p  pRemoving event listeners is noticed only in Safari Mobile, so it can be a BUG in Safari or I missed something.p  pAny suggestion is more than welcome, thanksp
Negative 154 pWe have a set of 5 online auction systems running on Windows Azure amp SQL Azure. Each system consists of a single web worker and one or more web roles. Each system is using ASP.NET MVC 3 and Entity Framework, Repository Pattern and StructureMap.p  pThe worker role is responsible for housekeeping and runs two groups of processes. One group is run every ten seconds, the other every second. Each process will likely run a database query or stored procedure. These are scheduled with Quartz.netp  pThe web role serves the public interface and back office. Among other basic crud functionality, both of these provide screens which, when open, will repeatedly call controller methods which will result in execution of stored procedure readonly queries. The frequency of repetition is about 23 seconds per client. A typical use case would be 5 back office windows open, and 25 end user windows open  all hitting the system repeatedly.p  pFor a long time we have been experiencing intermittent SQL timeout errors. Three of the most common ones arep  blockquote   pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException A transportlevel error has occurred when receiving results from the server. provider TCP Provider, error 0  An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.p      pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException A transportlevel error has occurred when receiving results from the server. provider TCP Provider, error 0  The semaphore timeout period has expired.p      pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.p blockquote  pThe only predictable scenario is during an auction where a specific controller  sproc starts to timeout during the event presumably due to load. All other times the errors appear to be completely random and come in singles, twos, and threes etc. even during periods of user inactivity. For example the system will go 18 hours without an error and then could be 5  10 errors from different housekeeping methods, or perhaps a user logged on and viewed their account.p  pOther infop  pI have tried to run the affected queriessprocs on SQL Azure using both local SSMS and Azure webbased query tool  all seem to execute quickly, 1 second max. Query plans not showing anything too suspicious although I am by no means a SQL query performance expert, or any other kind of expert for that matter Jp  pWe have wrapped all affected areas in Azure SQL Transient Fault Handling Blocks  but as is discussed here a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSssdsgetstartedthread7a50985d92c2472f9464a6591efec4b3 relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSssdsgetstartedthread7a50985d92c2472f9464a6591efec4b3a, they do not catch timeouts, and according to Valery M this is for good reason.p  pWe are not storing any session information in the database, although asp.net membership information is stored in the database.p  pWe use 1 SQL Azure server instance which hosts all 5 databases, two for staging and three for production. All 5 systems are generally active at the same time although it is unlikely that more than one will be in a state of live load use at any given time. All web roles, worker roles and the SQL Azure server reside in the same Azure Geographical Region.p  pAny thoughts on where we should be looking Would it help giving each system its own SQL Azure server ... Failing a solution by ourselves  is it possible to get Microsoft to open a support ticket and take a look under the hood at whats going on in with our application  how does one go about thisp  pThanks in advance.p  pIlanp

Negative 154 pI have been working on a large java application. It is quite parallel, and uses several fixedThreadPools each with 8 threads. I am running it on a computer with 2 cores, each with 4 processors. My program is analyzing large sets of data, and the analysis is saved serialized after every set, though it works across data sets, and so is reloaded every time I run a new one and then saved. My problem is this after running 45 data sets takes about 2 days, and Im pretty happy with my coding efficiency it will crash, after exactly the same amount of time on the 5th set no matter which data set I use. The program is repetitive, and so there is nothing new in the code going on at this time. It is reproducible, and I am not sure what to do. I can post the full error log if that would help... I understand that this problem is ambiguous without a lot more detailed information, but if there are any goto suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pI have been testing different settings to see if anything helps, and right now I am running with the following arguments.p  pXmx6g Xmx12g XXUnlockExperimentalVMOptions XXUseG1GCp  pThanks, Joep  precode  A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment    SIGSEGV 0xb at pc0x0000000000000000, pid18454, tid140120548144896   JRE version 7.003b147  Java VM OpenJDK 64Bit Server VM 22.0b10 mixed mode linuxamd64 compressed oops  Derivative IcedTea7 2.1.1pre  Distribution Ubuntu precise development branch, package 7u32.1.1pre11ubuntu2  Problematic frame  C  0x0000000000000000   Failed to write core dump.

I am using the PHP SDKs getLogoutURL function, and it logs the user out of Facebook, but my access token is still fully valid and PHP refuses to send the user to the login page. Why I have no idea.

Negative 154 pstill trying to get started in the world of databases, running into issues dailyp  pI have a table songs which contains information on artiststracksp  precodeCREATE TABLE songs      songid INT AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,      artistname varchar100 DEFAULT NULL,     songname varchar100 DEFAULT NULL,     tagfk SMALLINT,     FOREIGN KEY tagfk REFERENCES tagstagid ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE,  ENGINE  InnoDB  CREATE TABLE tags      tagid SMALLINT AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,     tagname varchar255 UNIQUE  ENGINE  InnoDB codepre  pNow I have a foreign key in songs referencing tags.tagid, tags.tagname will later contain tags like lovesong, melancholic. Now in certain cases a song can have more than one tag, so if its a melancholic lovesong it should have both tags. Though I just noticed I can not add two SMALLINT to tagfk seperated by comma, it only allows one SMALLINT per row.p  pI figured I could add a new row to tag.tagname containing lovesongmelancholic and later process it in php, splitting it by , but that is rather a less sexy solution to the problem, especially because the data is added by a program and I would have to deal with sorting the strings, too, so I wouldnt end up with duplicate tags like lovesongmelancholic and melancholiclovesong, which is basically the same.p  pHow is that issue commonly solved If I do replace songs.tagfk by a varchar column songs.tag instead I will have tons of duplicate data, as theres gonna be a lot of Lovesongs and Melancholic songs in the database, so a foreign key solution is probably best.p  pI also thought about adding songs.tagsfk and songs.tagsfk2 but thats rather a dirty hack, too. Especially if some songs start having more than 2, 3, 4 tags.p  pWhats the best way to deal with that p

Negative 154 pId like to automatically generate a web API from a database. I can easily query the database with SQL, but obviously this wont do for a public API. I can also write the serverside code manually, but this will take a very long time, since the database is fairly large. Also, writing it manually would be a very mechanical and repetitive task, so I dont see why a program cant do it for me.p  pFor example, lets say I have a table in my database called Announcements. Im looking for a way to given that database table, automatically generate the serverside code that will allow someone to create new announcements, requiring the correct fields. Done manually, this could look like a PHP file called createannouncement.php, which requires all the fields that exist in the database, like the announcement title, body, and author. Of course, this could also be done in a cleaner way by following some design model like REST, but this is meant as an example.p  pOther things Im considering arep  ul liSome form of authentication. For example, if the user would like to delete an announcement, heshe should be required to log in to do so. Im not sure how this works here.li liSome way to add logic. If I can generate an API to access the database through HTTP as I tried to describe above, the API will not be aware of certain specificities. Lets say the announcement resource should include a date that must be emafterem today. I need a way to express that in the code.li liIt would be ideal if the solution could follow some design model to make it easier to access from different clients.li ul  pSo what kind of tools should I look into What is the general approach people take when confronted with this problemp

But Im wondering whether this is the best solution to this problem, or if Im abusing the Django Group and Permission concepts, here, and should be doing something else, like creating new models or just putting flags like ismembermanager on my user profile model, etc.p

Negative 154 pI have a question to ask, which occurred when reading the concept of static variables. If I create an allocated block of memory in a function, using codemalloccode, and then the function returns to codemaincode, without having used codefreecode on the allocated memory, will that memory block be susceptible to changes in the course of the program, or not I mean, after I leave the function is it possible that the memory block can be overwritten by another process, while I wanted to use it andor edit it in my way, or is it locked from something like that, until I free it Is it possible for the block to be considered as free of data before I free itp

Negative 154 pMy understanding is that Bandwidth delay product refers to the maximum amount of data intransit at any point in time, between two endpoints.p  pThe thing that I dont get is, why multiply bandwidth by RTT. Bandwidth is a function of underlying medium, such as copper wire, fire optics etc and RTT is function of how busy intermediate nodes are, any scheduling applied at the intermediate nodes, distance etc. RTT can change, but bandwidth for practical purposes can be considered as fixed. So how does multiplying a constant value capacity aka bandwidth by fluctuating value RTT represents total amount of data in transitp  pBased on this, will a really really slow have very large capacity Chances are the Causes of RTT will start dropping.p

Negative 154 pIm switching from a MySQL backend to a PostgreSQL backend and am running into some model inheritance issues. Here is an example of the modelsp  precodeclass Parentmodels.Model    key  models.Charfield...    value  models.Charfield...    contenttype  models.ForeignKeyContentType    objectid  models.CharFieldmaxlength200    contentobject  generic.GenericForeignKeycontenttype, objectid  class Child1Parent    pass   class Child2Parent    pass codepre  pThe reason we have two child classes like this is, were simulating two keyvalue pairs in another model, and wanted to separated them into two tables for an easier lookup. The Generic FKs were also for attaching this to other models. This inheritance setup works fine in MySQL, but when I switched it to PostgreSQL, I get an error when trying to run our tests but syncdb works fine. Its as if Django is OK with the relationship but PostgreSQL doesnt like the SQL being generated. When I look at whats being generated from syncdb I see thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE myappparent  id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, key varchar200 NOT NULL, value varchar200 NOT NULL, contenttypeid integer NOT NULL REFERENCES djangocontenttype id DEFERRABLE  INITIALLY DEFERRED, objectid varchar200 NOT NULL  CREATE TABLE myappchild1  parentptrid integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES myappparent id DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED  CREATE TABLE myappchild2  parentptrid integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES myappparent id    DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED codepre  pSo everything looks right, then when I run my tests I get thisp  precodeError Database testmyapp couldnt be flushed. Possible reasons  The database isnt running or isnt configured correctly.  At least one of the expected database tables doesnt exist.  The SQL was invalid. Hint Look at the output of djangoadmin.py sqlflush. Thats the SQL this command    wasnt able to run. The full error column id of relation myappchild1 does not exist codepre  pWhen I run flushp  precodeSELECT setvalpggetserialsequencemyappchild1,id, 1, false codepre  pIve tried manually adding an ID field as the primary key in the child model but Django throws an error saying it conflicts with the Parents ID field. How do I fix this so PostgreSQL likes it And thanks in advance. p

Negative 154 pI have some class structure for the project I build for my company. At some point, Ive seen a usually unwanted slicing of derived object could actually make my code efficient.

Since these stuff are at constructors, and since I cannot use exception handling embedded system I thought of thisp  precode     this is the object holder test block    there is some latch  Base  above  lets call it ObjectHolder   extern Base ObjectHolder     Derived  deriv  new Derived   int dType  derivgtGetMyType    if dType  1  if test at base succeded but the one in derived failed      Base  amp staticcastltBasegt deriv  specifically slice the object   else ifdType 2       Base  deriv   else      delete deriv  this is a TYPE0  nonworking object so dont latch it     use other implemented methods to do work ...   codepre  pNow, why have I got such a design Well, while I was designing the classes, since the methods of inner workings of Base type 1 and Derived type 2 classes differ and there is a possibilty of type 3,4,5.... objects that are also different in inside and since I didnt want to make and ifthenelse check in every single method I thought Id make such a design and make the differing methods virtual so they could be called correctly with thanks to polymorphism whilst the common methods can be at some Base class. p  pBut now, firstly, Im not sure if that weird syntax  amp staticcast lt Base   deriv  is correct tested and seemed like working but I just want to make sure this is not because of luck and secondly, Im not sure if this is the suggested method to achive this  I kinda suspect that this syntax can cause memory leaks or something...p  pChanged code a little bit also corrected syntax to make the problem clearer.p  pNow, since the ampstaticcastderiv is a faulty approach, I was thinking if I can make a copy constructor which bypasses the check at the Base class which is actually the reason I try these stuff  I dont want that test to be run in some cases. Like belowp  precodeclass Base        other stuff is like above       cc     Baseconst Base ampother  myTypeother.myType                no test is performed here            like other one above  codepre  pWith this written, I think I can do that now at the test blockp  precode      the code above     if dType  1  if test at base succeded but the one in derived failed      Base  new Basederiv  specifically slice the object with cc       code goes on ...   codepre  pWhat about thisp

They are positioned in relation to the back ground image and other images within the view. If I use Auto Layout my images may move yet the coordinates of my drawing will not move accordingly. Is there an official way of handling this or do I need to write some code to detect the device and use that. p  pThanks guysp

I guess this is to prevent overwriting fields that arent in the form with null.  But how can I let them set fields in the form to null if they need top  pFor example, the user edits an codeEventcode object.  codeEvent.datecode is 1113.  The user sets the codeEvent.datecode field in the form to empty and submits the form.  Inspecting codeEvent.datecode in the debugger shows its value is null.  I save the codeEventcode.  If I look at the codeEventcode in the database, its value is still 1113.p  pEdit It seems there is a method for this.  The only problem is it doesnt work on nested entities.

Negative 154 pIs it possible to create a dynamic copy of an assembly or moduleclass  I was able to easily find how to create a dynamic assembly or module from scratch using codeAssemblyBuildercodecodeModuleBuildercode as seen a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.reflection.emit.methodrental.swapmethodbodyvvs.100.aspx relnofollowherea, but is there a way to create a copy of an existing assembly or type as its respective Builder typep  h2Edit 1h2  pFor example, say you have a standard Console Application with the obligatory codeProgramcode class and codeMaincode method and you add another class to the project, called A.  My goal is to create a dynamic copy of the codeAcode class within the codeMaincode method using codeModuleBuildercode or something like it.p  h2Edit 2h2  pThe reason I want to make a copy of class codeAcode, is because I would like an emexactem duplicate of class codeAcode, including methods, fields, properties, etc., but created dynamically.  What I emdontem want, is to have to manually create the type and all of its members methods, fields, properties, etc. using TypeBuilderCodeDom, since, in some cases, I may not know all of the details about a class and its inner workings or the class may be large and tediousimpossible to reproduce using this method.p  pHopefully some pseudocode can illustrate what Im looking forp  precode create AssemblyBuilder using the assembly of the A class so you end up with a  dynamic copy of the assembly AssemblyBuilder ab  new AssemblyBuilderAssembly.GetAssemblytypeofA   get the Type as a TypeBuilder from the AssemblyBuilder TypeBuilder tb  ab.GetModuleTest.exe.GetTypetypeofA.FullName codepre  pId basically just like to box an codeAssemblycode as an codeAssemblyBuildercode or codeTypecode as a codeTypeBuildercode.  I also dont need to be able to save the assembly.p
Negative 154 pFor Android, people recommend using dp density independent measurements for UI elements, and there are conventions that exist such as using 48dp for a button height, etc.p  pIm working on a CSSHTMLJavascript application, and Im getting a lot of criticism on the UI design saying it does not conform with Android design standards. Obviously my application is going to look different since it is using CSSHTMLJavascript instead of the Android Holo theme, but I would still like to make it conform as much as possible. However CSS does not allow density independent measurements. When I test my application on different resolutions and pixel densities it does not look good and sometimes it is way out of proportion so its not even functional. CSS doesnt have dp units like Android native development does, but I was wondering what some alternatives are. Can I somehow get the pixel density using Javascript and manually scale everything appropriately What is the best way for making a CSSHTMLJavascript app that looks and works nicely on all resolutionsdensitiesp

Negative 154 pI am writing a programm to show my notes like the short notes of windows 7 on the desktop. Therefore i created a main window with a menu from where you can create notes. If you click on newNote, a new note is created instantly and directly shown on the desktop, besides the main window.p  pOf course, later I only want to see the notes, and the handling of the notes should be made from an icon in the systray so no more with the mainwindow. Adapting the code of Simon Brunning for a systray icon menu, i was able to create the menu in the systray. the menuoptions of the systray are the same as those of the former main window. The strange thing for me is If i create a new note there, I know that the methodfunction called worked, because i let it print in the shell. But no note is shown. The note only shows off if I close the systraymenu. p  pIn general it looks like p  precodeclass Note    def initself, notesetNone, propertiesNone         self.rootTk         self.notesetnoteset         self.propertiesproperties          ...      ...  class Noteset     def initself,                  onquitNone,                  defaultmenuindexNone,                  windowclassnameNone          self.notes  []         self.properties            mainmenu         self.root2Tk         self.menubarMenuself.root2         self.filemenuMenuself.menubar, tearoff0         self.filemenu.addcommandlabelnew note, commandself.newNote         self.menubar.addcascadelabelMenu,menuself.filemenu         self.root2.configmenuself.menubar      the initargumentes are only for the systraymenu.     in class Noteset, both the mainwindow and the systray icon are created.          ltcode for the systraygt      def newNoteself         noteNotenotesetself         self.notes.appendnote         return note      ...

Negative 154 pI am currently subclassing pythons threading.Thread class in order to add additional logging features to it.

So I am looking to authenticate in Kerberos using the Windows SSPI library. I managed to compile libcurl with SSPI and SPNEGO support.p  pNow my problem is that I need to connect to any supplied realm with the provided credentials it could be the realm of the current user or a different one.

Finally I was assuming I had to do some work with SSPI beforehand, but curl is properly supporting that.p  pcurl will make the authentication to the kerberos realm and store it in the LSA cache when using the properly built version of curl with the SSPI and SPNEGO flag.p  pWhen using curl.exe to test, you strongneedstrong to specify the emnegotiateem argument along with the usernamepassword. However, when using libcurl simply set the CURLOPTHTTPAUTH option to anything that contains CURLAUTHGSSNEGOTIATE such as CURLAUTHANY.

What I would rather like is to use the provided credentials emuser2.B.COMem to login p  pAlso, I am not quite sure if it is possible to add an entry in the LSA cache of a different user than the one currently logged p  pHow can I make this work by impersonating the user emuser2.B.COMem in a way that libcurl will have access to the ticket associated with this user to authenticate to the web server p

Im trying to implement the codeViewPagercode from Androids a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtraininganimationscreenslide.html relnofollowUsing ViewPager for Screen Slidesa tutorial to have different text on each page, like you are swiping through pages in a book.  The way its set up, they have two XML files one that implements the ViewPager element in a Fragment Activity class, one that has a textview in a Fragment class that shows Lorem Ipsum on every single page.  Im trying to find a way to change the textview in the Fragment class so that when I go to page 2, 3, 4, etc. there is different text on each page.p  pIn the codeScreenSlideActivitycode class, Ive tried using a switch inside the codeonPageScrollStateChangedint positioncode inner event handler, setting certain text views to visibleinvisible.

Negative 154 pI am working with many codeLinkedHashMapcode that are either codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Longgtcode, codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Doublegtcode or codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Integergtcode.p  pMy objective is to find or create a method that will return a codeListltLonggtcode with all the keys in the above codeLinkedHashMapltLong,...gtcode strongin the same orderstrong. The ordering is important which is why I dont think I can use codemyMap.keySetcode which is a codeSetltLonggtcode. Also, I have many other methods that accept only codeListltLonggtcode as the input so I would like the desired method to return in that object type so I can continue to use these methods.p  pWriting a method to return this for, e.g., a codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Longgtcode is easy enoughp  precodeprivate static ListltLonggt getLongKeysLinkedHashMapltLong, Longgt target      ListltLonggt keys  new ArrayListltLonggt      forMap.EntryltLong, Longgt t  target.entrySet          keys.addt.getKey          return keys  codepre  pHowever, then I need to write almost identical methods except for codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Doublegtcode and codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Integergtcode.p  pIs there any way I can generalize the method that I pasted to accept all three types codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Longgtcode, codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Doublegtcode or codeLinkedHashMapltLong, Integergtcodep
Negative 154 pIs there some way to create a view in a database that links to nonexistent tablesp  pWeve just discovered that a data import routine has been failing for a period of time because of a rather large upgrade that accidentally removed a view.p  pThe view in the database for our product, hosted on a client server was linked to a table in one of our customers databases, and created by our client for the purpose.p  pThe accidental removal of this view was due to the quantity of database changes including the creating and dropping of views, and the fact the SQL comparison tool was going to drop the clientspecific view was simply missed.p  pSo it would be really useful to be able to create a copy of this view on our local development databases with full qualified names to the client tables that we obvious dont have access to outside of the live environment so this doesnt happen again.p  pThe customer in question is running SQL Server 2008, however this is a product that is also run on 2005 environment for other customers.  So an answer for 2005 would be preferable, but if its 2008 specific that isnt a problem.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo respond to Damiens comment...p  pI understand what youre saying, and creating an empty table that is being linked to in the view would make a lot of sense.p  pUnfortunately the table in question is hosted not only in a different database, but on a different SQL server.  That would mean that I would have create a new server instance on all our development machine, in order to host this single empty table.  And I would have to do this on quite a number of our clients, resulting in a LOT of practically unused server instances.p  pIm really hoping to be able to avoid this, and instead be able to create the view which obviously will fail in our development environment but will not be accidentally removed again in the future.p  hr  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pIve taken on board what Damien has said and implemented this using codeLinked Servercode... see my answer for more detailsp

Negative 154 pI have multiple app projects which all link to the same static library project. Each app project needs to compile the static library project using different settings.p  pAt the moment I have a conditional compilation header in the static library project, lets call it ViewType.h which adds more types, typedefs, macros, etc specific to each view. p  precodedefine VIEWA 1 define VIEWB 2 define VIEWC 3  ifndef VIEWTYPE define VIEWTYPE VIEWA endif  if VIEWTYPE  VIEWA      further typedefs and defines tailored to VIEWA elif VIEWTYPE  VIEWB      further typedefs and defines tailored to VIEWB elif VIEWTYPE  VIEWC      further typedefs and defines tailored to VIEWC endif codepre  pThe problem here is that each app project needs to change the VIEWTYPE in the static library project, and every time I switch app projects I have to change the VIEWTYPE again.p  pUnfortunately it seems I can not define VIEWTYPE2 for example as preprocessor macro in the app target. And I cant define this in the static library project either because all 3 projects include the same static library project, because the .xcodeproj is shared between the 3 apps ie the .xcodeproj is dragged amp dropped onto the app project Im not using a workspace.p  pI understand one issue is that the static library being a dependent target it is built first before the app target is even considered. So perhaps theres some way to make that decision which app the library is built for based on other conditionals ie checking for a file, or including an optional appspecific header.p  pstrongQuestionstrong How I can create a macro or otherwise perform conditional compilation based on macrossettings defined by the app target which are then adhered to by the static library projectp

Negative 154 pI have a project which was started from 90s in CC. Therefore, it contains many old style code such as KampRstyle function declaration, obsolete function, ...p  pThe project can work fine in Visual Studio 2008, but now I want to use it on the new version of Visual Studio specific VS 2010 because other projects are coded in Visual Studio 20102012. I dont want to have many version of Visual Studio on my machine.p  pYet, the Visual Studio throw me too many error, which I can fix all of them. Another reason make me scare to edit the source code is that I want some guys can open it in old version too. I mean its back compatible.p  pMy question is how to use those old code in Visual Studio 20102012 without changing the codes. Or just fix a few lines of codes, which does not cause error if someone else use that code in older version. Is there a way to tell new Visual Studio use older compiler or something like thatp  pThank every bodyp

Negative 154 pWhen a views template is refreshed due to changes of the model, the codedidInsertElementcode hook is not triggered as Ember tries to reuse views as much as possible. This causes some problems for me in that I need to select the first element of a list when the template is rerendered. This happens, for example, when new data is loaded from the server or the application transitions to a different route.p  pThe odd thing is that the views codeinitcode method does get called when the application transitions to a different route. The issue is that the template hasnt been rendered at that point, that is, the view hasnt been populated with the new contents of the controller.p  pstrongIn short, how can I be notified emafterem the template of a view has finished rerendering so that I can manipulate the views contentsstrongp  pFor your information, observing the controllers model is not an option either as the view hasnt been updated by the time the callback is fired.p  precodeltscript typetextxhandlebars idlistgt ltdivgt   ltulgt   each model.items     ltli classitemgt       ltpgttitleltpgt     ltligt   each   ltulgt ltdivgt ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong The view needs to be notified when the codeeachcode block is rerendered.

Since my pages are around 7000px, its way out of the viewport and user is not able to see it.p  pDoes anyone have a good suggestion on how to achieve this I have tried CSS option, but since top property is set dynamically, CSS is simply not taking any effect.p  pI have also tried centering it to the overlay, but since uioverlay element doesnt exist until the modal is initialized, Im not able to use it as an archer for centering.p  pJust FYI, Im trying to do this as a workaround for positioning bug of link widget of hallojs.p

Negative 154 pI have two questions regarding ActiveMQ.p  ol liOn my environment, I set up 3 ActiveMQ in 3 servers and share one Database. Is it possible to run the 3 ActiveMQ in the 3 servers to share the same database I tried to set it up. However, it looks like 3 brokers cannot share the same database. Is it correctli liAlso, I did some Failover testing, it looks like the ActiveMQ cannot guarantee the message order. e.g. I set up the 3 ActiveMQ into ServerA,ServerB and ServerC. And then, I published MessageA,MessageB into ServerA and published MessageC into ServerB. The ServerA ServerB and ServerC had been set up as Failover servers. When I shut down ServerA, the only MessageC can be consumed. However, the consumed message order should be MessageA,MessageB and MessageC. I need to keep this message order even through the ServerA is down. Is it possible to configure ActiveMQ to guarantee the message order for Failoverli ol  pThank youp

The sivalptr is the same as the one we set in makeTimer, though here it lives in a different structure. Obviously, it got copied from there to here on the way to this signal handler. The point is that the timerID is what is used to determine which timer just went off and determine what to do next    static void timerHandler int sig, siginfot si, void uc       timert tidp      tidp  sigtsivalue.sivalptr      if  tidp  firstTimerID           TASK1Task2msRaster    else if  tidp  secondTimerID         TASK2Task10msRaster     else if  tidp  thirdTimerID          TASK3Task100msRaster    The function takes a pointer to a timert variable that will be filled with the timer ID created by timercreate.  This pointer is also saved in the sivalptr variable right before calling timercreate.

Negative 154 pSo while testing some code I discovered some odd functionality in Python, namely two variables with different values evaluating as equal. The code that produces said behavior is as followsp  precodeclass Foo     def initself         self.x  [1,2,3]         self.y  self.x      def ChangeXself         self.x.append4      def equalsself         printself.xself.y codepre  pWhen I run this code the variables initialize as they should and such. If I runp  precodef  Foo f.equals codepre  pThe output is True, which I can understand because both f.x and f.y hold the same value at this point. However, when I runp  precoder  Foo r.ChangeX r.equals codepre  pThe output is still true. This confuses me. r.x and r.y plainly do not hold the same values anymore printing them in sequence even gives different outputs, and yet Python seems to believe that the two variables equal each other. p  pI have a hunch that this has to do with the fact that Im using a class however I still dont know what exactly is going on here or how to fix it. Can someone explain    p

Heres the full html code, img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0ZSxn.jpg altThis is how i want, on resizing, no gap should come, plus the navbar brand should not overlap the form.

Negative 154 pMost of the examples of AngularJS controllers that I have seen, usually have a single action method that wires everything up for the view.

The Asp.net MVC example or the Ruby on Rails example is similar to how many actions work in other MVC implementations.  In AngularJS I guess there is only one actionconstructor method, where in one would attach any additional behavior.  The Asp.net MVC example on the other hand has both a constructor and two action methods that can both be routed to in different ways. similar to the single AngularJS contrustoraction.  p

So as long as I didnt pass through tomcat authentication workflow I cant authenticate anything. Also I discovered that its not possibile to configure different loginconfiguration in the same web application, so having defined form authentication prevents me to authenticate in others way. Probably what I will need is a custom implementations of the class BaseAuthenticator base class for FormAuthenticator, BasicAuthenticator, etc, containing the code for the respective login configuration but Im not sure that it could be a good idea, maybe a security filter will be a better solution.p  pKnowing anything about security filters in tomcat, I temporarily managed to solve my problem simulating a form authentication in my servlet really awful, I know.p

Negative 154 pAs I understand it if redis is to run on a cluster of machines, there will be several slaves and one master. And slaves can be made to connect to the master upon startup with a command. And then sentinels on each machine on the cluster could connect to the master to find out all slaves and then switch one of them to master if current master goes down for some reason.p  pNow, my question is  How can we fail over when the designated master is down when we start the redis servers on the cluster  the SLAVEOF command will fail and there will not be a master and therefore nothing for the sentinels to get the config data from. How do we solve this problem  Thanks p

Negative 154 pI have a scenario where I use recursion to verify if a condition is true or false in a set of elements, when the condition for any element becomes false the whole condition is false.p  pI have used valueof to print true or false, however since it is recursive the output ends up something like truefalsetruetrue.

Due to this I check the length of the final output where an empty string signifies the overall condition was true and when not empty false is signified.p  pIs there a far more elegant way to do this where the param data directly receives a true or false output which can be directly be used to check if the overall condition was successful.p  precodeltxsltemplate matchgt     ltxslparam namedatagt         ltxslapplytemplates selectDatagt             ltxslwithparam nameexpression selecttrue gt         ltxslapplytemplatesgt     ltxslparamgt     lt         instead of a single false or true it will be like truefalsefalsetrue depending on the number of loops         As a hack we check if the data variable is an empty string or not where empty string signifies true     gt     ltxslvalueof selectdata gt ltxsltemplategt  ltxsltemplate matchDatagt     ltxslparam nameexpressiongt     ltxslif testexpressiontruegt         ltxslapplytemplates selectData gt             ltxslwithparam nameexpression selectxpathConditiongt         ltxslapplytemplatesgt     ltxslifgt     ltxslif testexpressionfalsegt         lt we only output when there is false, so by doing this we can check if the output to the variable in the parent template is empty or not to then         identify if the overall condition is false or true gt         ltxslvalueof selectexpression gt     ltxslifgt ltxsltemplategt codepre  pThanksp

Negative 154 pSo as I assume, everyone use a local stack for development. Now heres my issue, my project heavily relies on inboundemails. And to do this, I planned on using Mandrill.

Negative 154 pAll of a sudden, Im seeing floods of first chance exceptions in the VS.NET Output window.p  pThere are 3 of us working on the project. Weve all updated our code to the latest in SVN and Im the only one seeing all the exceptions, so the issue is not our app, but I suspect, some setting that I accidentally triggered in VS.NET.p  pIf I right click the Output window, Exception Messages is checked. It always has been and is for my coworkers, so thats not the issue.p  pI cannot see any options in codeToolsOptionsDebuggingcode that could be responsible. I suspect I probably just accidentally hit some accelerator key combo that did it. These appear to be perfectly normal first chance exceptions like setting a property in a dynamic object for the first time causing a RuntimeBindingException. The app seems to operate just fine. But the flood of messages is annoying and makes debug output hard to follow.p  pBy far the most common exception is an codeArgumentExceptioncode with the message, codeA property with the name UriTemplateMatchResults already exists.codebr We use WCF very heavily but no REST and have a number of WCF services that our app communicates with, so Im assuming thats just standard WCF stuff because the calls are all working fine.p  pCan anyone think of anything I might have donep

Negative 154 pOkay, I have had a few questions floating around stackoverflow now, and most of them are related to this one question. Ive been trying to get it myself, and I have a couple of times but the result is never quite what I expected. I am trying to develop a chain that my sprite can throw. p  pSo far what I have done is thrown the lead of the hook from the centre of the sprite outward. Once it travels 10 pixels away from the sprites position it generates another link in the chain. The chain is then rotated to match the lead chains rotation and attached to it using a joint pin. It actually works fairly well. The only problem is it only works when I set the physics world speed to 0.01. If I return it to normal physics it throws the lead link in the chain but basically skips over everything else. Before this I tried containing the lead link in a physics body and calling a didEndContact to attach the other links but that didnt work nearly as well.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I can accomplish this I just need the chain to extend from the sprites position, to a maximum length, and then afterwards retract. I had no idea it was going to be this difficult. Thank you in advance for all of your help, if you would like me to post my code I would be glad to, but considering I dont think it will work I havent added it yet. Once again thank you very much in advance I have been racking my brain over this for weeks and it seems like Im getting nowhere, although I have learnt many invaluable concepts which I am deeply appreciative to the stackoverflow community for.p

The problem is in the converter, or at least thats the assumption that I have been going on. When I look at the collection of items that it gets passed there are all the properties that are being sent to the datagrid. However I cannot do anything with the data that is sent to the converter.p  pConverterp  precode Public Function Convertvalue As Object, targetType As Type, parameter As Object, culture As CultureInfo As Object Implements IValueConverter.Convert     If TypeOf value Is ReadOnlyObservableCollectionOf Object Then         Dim items  CTypevalue, ReadOnlyObservableCollectionOf Object         Dim total As Decimal  0         For Each gi As GroupItem In items             total  gi.Hours         Next gi         Return total.ToString     End If     Return  codepre  pSo this converter was a conversion from c, that I found in another question.  I cannot cast it to the same type of object as the original, although this probably could be done with some major modifications to the underlying datagrid source. I have also tried casting it to a simple class that has the properties of the collection that is passed to the converter it just errors and says that the item Hours in this case is not part of the CollectionGroupViewInternal  When stepping through the code and looking at the collection there is a property Hours  . p  pI hope I made my issue clear, something tells me this is a super easy fix, but my stubborn nature required that I spend way to many hours on this. p  pWhat Im hoping to do is create a converter that I can use over and over to get the total of specific columns and place it in a TextBlock of the header of that group. The current project that Im working on will have dozens of these DataGrids with groupings. p  pThank you for your help in advance.p

Negative 154 pLet me clarify the questionp  pIm using JQplot to make some graphs in my custom cms.  The graph has multiple series and multiple bars in those series, such as each countrys users signed up.  the series country UK then has 4 bars displayed that show the year 2012, 2013 etc etc.p  pThe client wants the following.p  pWhen hovering over a specific bar, all other bars for that year in other countrys need to also be highlighted. So basically on Hover get Current Position, change all other positions iterating through each series hover effect.p  pNow we do something similar already with an OnClick event where it changes the information going into the page via the culture selected.p  pexamplep  precodetotalusers.bindjqplotDataClick,         function ev, seriesIndex, pointIndex, data              var temp  CountryCode[seriesIndex]             window.location.href  mywebsite  temp  ampreturnurl252fAdmin                   codepre  pNow i looked up at a hover event to use 1st for this new functionality.p  precodesignUpsPerCountry.bindjqplotDataMouseOver, function ev, seriesIndex, pointIndex, data   codepre  pthe problem i have is the arguments passed into here are just numbers, my way of thinking is i need the actual object of the bar so i can get all other related bars and change there properties.p  pHowever after digging around it appears that this isnt how jqplot works.  Ive gone through the documentation and taken a look at lots of examples that do really specific stuff that doesnt change the state of the bars but rather changes tooltips etc etc.  p  pCould someone help me figure out how i get each point in the series im thinking use seriesindex then use pointindex for the similar bars in each series and then manipulate the css of that bar to highlightp  pMany thanks p

Negative 154 pI cant seem to find exactly what Im looking for after a few days worth of hunting, so if anyone has seen exactly what Im trying to do elsewhere, Id love a link or two.p  pAnyway, Im trying to build an app to connect into an ERP system that returns user access information in JSON format via REST request using an email address and password. Most users of the system only have a singular access role, so no big deal for them, but others have multiple roles. The trouble Im having is taking these multiple access roles and adding them into a ListView where they can select the role with which they wish to use to gain access.p  pTrouble is, I need a display that uses two lines per selection to properly display all userpertinent data and some way to record the user selection. The data useful in the background for the selection would not be displayed, as it would not mean anything to the user. Ive been able to take the JSON response and map it to a custom class I designed for it without any problems not actually all that useful, mostly only helps for discerning the results count prior to displaying multiple results to the ListView. But I cant figure out how to properly build the ListView layout and map the data to the layout. Im having trouble understanding how to build the view and insert data into new list items.p  pThe best I figure, if I can get the results to display in a ListView and then record the selection in the shared preferences, Ill be golden.p

Negative 154 pI have just installed Sikuli on the 5th system in our company. We are using it to automate some tasks that have to be done every day exactly the same way and are easily enough scripted with Sikuli.p  pIt is on this 5th and final system that I ran into trouble. There is nothing that I can tell which is different on this system than any other that I have installed it on previously. Windows XP 32 bit operating system. Java 7 installed, Python 2.74 installed, and Sikuli 1.0.1.p  pSo now, on this one, the type function does not seem to work at all. Any of the other visual functions seem to work perfectly. It is just this type function I am having trouble with. The log in the IDE shows that the command was sent example [log]TYPE www.google.com. Can anyone shed any light on this problem I will be happy to provide any additional information that is requested. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 154 pI am trying to write a GDB frontend. I use GDB for debugging embedded targets, especially with ARM processors. I have used Eclipse before, but I didnt like it very much. At work, we use Lauterbach Trace32, which is one of the most comfortable debuggers I have ever used. Thats why I started a project where I try to implement a very similar application as a GDB frontend, which is specialised to embedded debugging.p  pHowever, I already have implemented some very basic commands, like viewing the source code, viewing registers of the target etc., which works well. Currently, I am implementing breakpoints. But for this I need some help.p  pI use Qt with Qtcreator on Linux for my project, so I have set up a QProcess for the gdb running in the background. I use the GDB Mi2 interface to communicate with gdb. Then, using write I can send commands and with a SIGNAL, I can receive the responses from GDB. This works well, but the answers from GDB in this MI format are very ugly to parse. Could anyone give me a hint how this can be done in a elegant way I tried BOOST to build a parser, which worked, but this is a much too complicated way in my opinion. Is there some better way to parse the GDB responsesp
Negative 154 pI wish to make a route for forgot passwordfunctionality, while using FlaskRestless. My idea was that the request could look like thisp  precodePOST apiuserltidgtforgotpassword codepre  pand FlaskRestless would send this request to a custom forgot passwordroute which I provided. This way, I could define my own complex operations here on the user object store intermediate stuff in DB, email password reset link, etc.p  pI have not been able to find such functionality in the a hrefhttpsflaskrestless.readthedocs.orgenlatestindex.html relnofollowdocs for FlaskRestlessa. Also, while trying to make a quick hacky separate route outside of FlaskRestless which simply corresponded to the above route, FlaskRestless still picked up on the request and returned a 405 Method Not Allowed.p  pOne can imagine this kind of functionality for other complex operations as well e.g. change password, change email.p  pIs it possible to achieve this routing scheme somehow If so, howp  pIf not, what would be an alternative An ordinary route in a separate blueprintp

Negative 154 pIm using a vb.net datagridview table for displaying several different types of data. When I need to load new data, I remove the rows and then remove the columns of the current data and then add the columns and rows of the new data.

Negative 154 plocation forms, effectively, a stack.  You can push URLs on it by hitting a link, you can pop URLs off it with the back button.  Unusually, when you pop a URL of the top of the stack, you also put into onto the next stack, and with the forward button, you can do the reverse.  A link pushes on the location stack and clears the next stack entirely.p  pWhat I would like to do, within the UIRouter ideally, is associate a small amount of data with the location stack.p  pThe idea is that if the user for example opens an accordion, clicks a link, and then clicks back, I can open the accordion to the same place.p  pNotice that if the domain or path changes, this is done automatically all of Javascript memory is retained.  With UIRouter, though, only the anchor portion of the URL changes, and I dont know how to simulate this behavior.p

Negative 154 pImagine, I have multiple detached signatures of some binary file and they stored in different .sig files. strongWhen somebody modifies file, all signatures will become invalidstrong. p  pFor xml an enveloped signature is widely used.

But XML modification anyway will break the last signature, why I have to check othersp  pThe only explanation  each codedsSignaturecode or PKCS7signature contains public key certificate with information about signer, key validity period, information for revokechecking. strongUsually, verification process is not only checking hashes, but providing information about signer and this is the only reason for iterate over all signarures, am I rightstrongp  pSo, when I want to verify multiple signed file and provide info about signers can I make small optimization  exract info for all signatures but perform hash checking only in one randomly chosen signaturep  pOne more question  how store multiple PKCS7 signatures in one file Im using strongbouncycastlestrong Java library.

Negative 154 pI am developing a Chrome Web App for offline use, where X person using it will be filling out a form and clicking save. This data I am saving in IndexedDB for later syncing to a server through an API we have.p  pThis is not the problem.p  pThe problem I am facing is the user filling out the form has to select a minimum of 1 image and possibly a max of 26 images then save.p  pThose images can be from 500KB upwards to 10MB in size. These images then have to be synced to the server at save time.p  pThe syncing part is simple enough, a bit of AJAX and I can save those fine.p  pThe problem I am facing is can a Chrome Web App save those images selected to its app dir somehow I dont want to leave them where they are on the users computer then grab when syncing. The reason being is this form is going to be used for days on end sometimes a full week and a half then synced to the server. So the user might and very well might just move or delete those images.p  pI have to make sure they are saved somewhere the user cant touch for later syncing.p  pI have searched all over for information on this but I am not finding anything.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to locally store images for the App then delete later during syncp

Negative 154 pI would like to use a set of codeifcode and codeelsecode statements to select which codetabsetPanelcode to use.

Negative 154 pIm using D3 to create a svg element and draw a bunch of open splines using cardinal interpolation.  Im drawing approximately 30 splines, each of which contain approximately 75150 vertex points... so in general this should be pretty easy.  However, I have a brush element on my page that Ive implemented as a slider a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock6452972 relnofollowsimilar to thisa.  At the moment, the brush event doesnt cause any redrawing on the lines... it merely recalculates the position of the handle.  Since its not really causing it to redraw anything, I would expect that the process of moving the handle on the brush would be very fast the slider would have no lag... however, I found that when its drawing all of the lines with a dashed stroked array, that its quite sluggish.  If I comment out the line which specifies the dashed array so that the lines are simply solid strokes, then the brush movement is much faster.  Is there a reason why this is happening  As I said, Im not having the brush redraw anything, so I dont know why there would be any performance difference... but it definitely seems to lag when its drawing dashed lines when compared to solid lines.  Any thoughtsp

Exp  precodeA  gt B gt [C, D] A gt B gt  C codepre  pAnother requirement that I have is that it should be easily modified and extended, maintaining the consistency. So for example if a node doesnt exist anymore it should be able to still know the path that it took to get there and a way to continue the flow from there.p  pThe best thing that I was able to come up is a multivalue weighted graph. The weight of an arch is determined by the version of the flow and a value inside a predetermined range 1  100, so if you get to the node using an arch with version 2 and value 5 you con move to adjacent nodes that have archs with version 2 and value between 1 and 100.p  pI know that there should be a better way to do this, but I cant come up with anything else or find anything that fits. p

Negative 154 pI am trying to understand the codetextFilecode method deeply, but I think my lack of Hadoop knowledge is holding me back here. Let me lay out my understanding and maybe you can correct anything that is incorrectp  pWhen codesc.textFilepathcode is called, then codedefaultMinPartitionscode is used, which is really just codemath.mintaskScheduler.defaultParallelism, 2code. Lets assume we are using the codeSparkDeploySchedulerBackendcode and this is p  precodeconf.getIntspark.default.parallelism, math.maxtotalCoreCount.get, 2 codepre  pSo, now lets say the default is 2, going back to the codetextFilecode, this is passed in to codeHadoopRDDcode. The true size is determined in codegetPartitionscode using codeinputFormat.getSplitsjobConf, minPartitionscode. But, from what I can find, the partitions is merely a hint and is in fact mostly ignored, so you will probably get the total number of blocks.p  pOK, this fits with expectations, however what if the default is not used and you provide a partition size that is larger than the block size. If my research is right and the getSplits call simply ignores this parameter, then wouldnt the provided min end up being ignored and you would still just get the block sizep  pa hrefhttpapachesparkuserlist.1001560.n3.nabble.comTryingtounderstandsctextFilebettertd22924.html relnofollowCross posted with the spark mailing listap

Every now and then, this reveals some bugs that need fixing before this code can be accepted as the new stablerelease version.p  pIf those bugs have a simple solution, I can make a single commit on that release branch, merge it to develop, and Im done.br However, Im not quite sure what I should do when the bug is a bit more complicated.  p  ul lipI cant use a featurebranchbr Those start from develop, which has moved on since the release was initiated.pli lipI dont think I should use a hotfix branchbr I need to start from a releasebranch instead of master, and I dont want the changes to be merged into master either at least not before the complete release was properly validated.pli lipI dont think I should work directly on the releasebranchbr This can generate broken code on the releasebranch code that is still under development is almost never good codepli ul  pMaybe I should use a releasefix branch or something similar...

Negative 154 pIm trying to build a small 2 players turn based game using Rails, to initialize the game only 1 player is needed who will set the field then another player can join. The each player in the game will have a land that can contain buildings, the relationship between them as followp  precodeGame hasmany lands Land belongsto game hasmany buildings Building belongsto game codepre  pOnly the game has a controller since its the master of them all, so when a game is to be initialized the request will contain info to create the land and buildings, and all are treated as one, so if one of those records fail I want to not commit anything. I thought of using codebuilding.save if land.savecode but itll produce error since Im saving a building to a land that doesnt exit but if I save the land first and the building fail then Ill need to delete the land and game, it gets complicated with multiple buildings going and various errors coming from multiple places to handle all those conditions.p  pWhat other options can I use to achieve thisp  pEdit Game controller will be something like thisp  precodeclass GamesController lt ApplicationController   def create     generate new land to contain buildings     land  Land.newuser currentuser     generate new buildings from array of hashes, contains coordslandid     buildings  []     params[buildings].each do building       buildings.push Building.newbuilding.mergeland land     end     game  Game.newuser1 currentuser, land1 land     land.game  game set the game it belongs to     some code here to save landgamebuildings     if one of them failed then nothing is saved at all.   end end codepre  pTheres also the problem that I cant save game like this because it validates existence of land, and cant save land because it validates existence of game, same goes for buildings they validate existence of land. So I need a code thatll save them in one go and still success in validating them all.p

Negative 154 pI have 4 classes, 1 of them is the main class that holds all the general objects. 3 others are situation classes for the lack of a better word, as they are included in different parts of the script as neededp  pI would like to access all three classes methods and objects from the main class or at least just the methods AND access the main class methods and variables from the other three classes, AND share the access between all the classes, so that I can call any method of any class from any class.p  pI know I can make the other three classes members of the main class like thisp  precodeclass Main      public test  test      public function construct classA, classB, classC              this gt classA  classA         this gt classB  classB         this gt classC  classC          echo Main just got constructed          public function test              echo this gt test       class A extends Main      public function TestA              echo In Class A       class B extends Main      public function construct              echo B just got constructed          public function TestB              echo In Class B        class C extends Main      public function TestC              echo In Class C           can we access B from here probably not.          would BTestB work          BTestB           yes it does.          but is there any other way of accessing the method like this gt TestB apart from extending the B class to C.          Is there any downside to using this way of accessing methods and variables what are the cons       A  new A B  new B C  new C Main  new Main A, B, C  C gt TestC Main gt classC gt TestC codepre  pThe first issue with this is, extending the Main class to other classes throws warnings because of the missing arguments for construct in the Main classp  precodeWarning Missing argument 1 for Mainconstruct codepre  pThe other concern is that if I use this method, then all three classes have to be initiated before the Main Class. But My script requires the main class to be executed at the very start as it establishes connections to mysql and sets environment variables etc. Plus it is not necessary that all three classes will be used at the same time, so in some part of the websites, only one class is required and it is pointless to initiate the other classes in those parts. I have more than 4 classes, this is just to make things simpler. In that case, how do I make the other classes members of Main after it has been initiatedp  pAnother thing, extending Main class thrice in other classes seems to initiate Main class thrice in separately.. which is resetting the main class objects and they are not the same when accessed with other classes. I found out about that issue when the test code threw Main just got constructed thrice and it was setting the variables to their default values. How to avoid that I would like the Main class variables to have same values across all the other classes.. kind of like global variables.p
