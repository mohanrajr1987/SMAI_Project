Positive 2498 pSo, I have a bunch of columns that need to be replaced with a letter, this is old signed overpunch stuff. So basically what I want to do is replace the letters with numbers and then multiply it by 0.01 for each cell.p  pSo basically, Ill have a column like       1. 0000012C  00000123 x 0.01  2.46       2. 0002927B  29272 x 0.01  585.44       3. 0000245N  00002455 x 0.01  24.55p  pSo the problem I cant figure out is how to make the value in a cell negative. As you can see the values for letters JKLMNOPQR are negative, however during the replacement step, excel doesnt know how to make the value negative. p  pI was wondering is there a step I can add where I can turn the values that are JKLMNOPQR negative first and then continue you with the replace function and the multiplication function. I was thinking an it would search cel for JKLMNOPQR and if it had JKLMNOPQR in the cell it would add a negative value in front of the cell and continue you on.p  pThanks in advanced, sorry I am new to this.p  precodePrivate Function DoReplaceText As String As String Dim ReplacedValue As String ReplacedValue  Text  ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, A, 1 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, B, 2 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, C, 3 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, D, 4 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, E, 5 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, F, 6 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, G, 7 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, H, 8 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, I, 9 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, , 0 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, , 0 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, J, 1 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, K, 2 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, L, 3 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, M, 4 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, N, 5 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, O, 6 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, P, 7 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, Q, 8 ReplacedValue  ReplaceReplacedValue, R, 9    DoReplace  ReplacedValue End Function     Private Sub MagicButtonClick Dim Text As String, CalculatedValue As Double  For Each cell In WorksheetsSheet1.RangeA1Z100.Cells     If cell.Value ltgt  Then         Text  DoReplacecell.Value         CalculatedValue  ValText  0.01  WorksheetsSheet2.Cellscell.Row, cell.Column.Value   CalculatedValue     End If Next End Sub codepre

Negative 2498 pWell this is incredibly frustrating.  After being nagged by Rails that I need to install the Cbased MySQL adaptor, I did so...  and then discovered that it wont work with MySQL under version 6.  Now gem uninstall mysql results in unknown gem mysql.  p  pI just spent half an hour trying to get the thing to install in the first place by juggling all the where the hell is my config file, anyway type of options.p  pAnyway, I cant find hints anywhere on how to use the ORIGINAL MySQL adaptor now that Ive discovered that its either that or an upgrade to MySQL 6, which I dont want to do since Im using an XAMPP package that works very nicely already p  pThis is on my local box for testing, this is not a dev or production server issue.  Ill deal with that later.p  pSo how do I either make sure Rails uses the built in version using command line options OR remove the MySQL gem  p  pOptional third option  Suck it up and upgrade my local copy of MySQL.p  pedit  Turns out I was wrong about the version of MySQL I needed in the first place, and I fixed and upgraded a bunch of stuff.  p  pHowever, my answer to the ORIGINAL question still stands  Delete the gem.  If gem itself cant delete it, just delete all traces of it and RoR will default to the original adapter.  This probably doesnt work in newer version of Rails, which I think REQUIRE the new adapter.p

My data provider is an codeArrayCollectioncode. p  pWhen I enter value in the input box, I can see the value fine as I expand or collapse the tree using the disclousure arrow. There is a strange issue when I try to expand and collapse tree from the codemxmlcode page with a button click to expand and collapse tree using the following code. p  pThe problem is as I expand or collapse tree, the values I entered in the input boxes appear to be moving. p  pFor example, I have entered 15 in input box 1. When I expand and collapse tree, 15 moves to another input box, and moves to another, and then it moves back to where it was entered as I keep expanding and collapsing the tree.

Negative 2498 pIm developing a game that maintains its information in a class called codeWorldStatecode. Each GameObject in the world trees, zombies, the player, health packs, etc is composed of three objects codeGameObjectControllercode, codeGameObjectModelcode, and codeGameObjectViewcode.

Right now, the implementation of codeIPersistentStatecode is codeReadWriteXMLcode, which uses XML.

The reason why I try to use a TSQL text command to send the binary data to the stored procedure is that in this way I remove some overhead to the server the stored prcoedure recieves the binary data and writes it to a file this is my final goal.

What does .NET have built in that might help  Are there any libraries to help with this  Are there any differences to consider if the user just pausesresumes within the same app session or if they pauseresume after opening, closing and then opening the application again  What about persisting this information across different computersp  pAny suggestions from past experience or patterns that come to mind  I hope this turns into more of discussion of the various ways of doing this and the proscons of each.  Thanks.p

Negative 2498 pIm not even sure if this is possible. I am using Kohana frameworkver 2.3. I have 2 separate databases. One called employees and another called tracker.

Negative 2498 pI think swept means determining if objects will collide at some point, not just whether they are currently colliding, but if Im wrong tell me. p  pI have objects with bounded boxes that are aligned on an axis. The boxes of objects can be different sizes, but they are always rectangular.p  pIve tried and tried to figure out an algorithm to determine if two moving AABB objects will collide at some point, but I am having a really hard time. I read a question on here about determining the time intervals when the two objects will pass at some point, and I didnt have a problem visualizing it, but implementing it was another story. It seems like there are too many exceptions, and it doesnt seem like I am doing it correctly.p  pThe objects are only able to move in straight lines though obviously they can change direction, e.g. turn around, but they are always on the axis. If they try to turn off the axis then it just doesnt work, and are bound to the axis. Their bounded boxes dont rotate or do anything like that. Velocity can change, but it doesnt matter since the point of the method is to determine whether, given the objects current state, they are on a collision course. If you need any more information let me know.p  pIf someone could provide some pseudocode or real code that would be great.

The idea is of course to maintain a single code base for my model and not to replicate it with subtle differences between different apps like importing from SAElixir here, and from Camelot there, and so on.p  pMy project is currently laid out with a model python packagep  precodemodelinit.py       foo.py       bar.py       ... codepre  pstronginitstrong.py looks like this p  precodefrom foo import a, b, c  from bar import d, e, f  all  a, b, c, d, e, f  codepre  pand python modules foo.py, bar.py, and so on actually implement the various parts. Every one of these modules starts like this p  precodefrom sqlalchemy import Integer, Numeric, Date, Unicode, LargeBinary  from elixir import Entity, Field, ManyToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany  from elixir import usingoptions  codepre  pAn idea could be to do something likep  precodetry     from camelot import Integer, Numeric, ... except ImportError     from elixir import Integer, Numeric, ... codepre  pwould that be actually a emgoodem idea or theres something Im missing Also, ideally Id do that kind of environment initialization stuff in some central place, like in codemodelinit.pycode, but how would I pass my imports to the underlying modulesp

Negative 2498 pDoes anybody know how to secure the JNDI access for remote clients on JBoss I know how to secure remote JMX invokers but even with that in effect it is still possile to lookup, bind and unbind things in JNDI even if the client is not authenticated.p  pI would like that that the server refuses to give you access to the InitialContext if you are not authenticated and to make it read only for some clients.

Also on the laptop Ive installed Eclipse PDT Helios Service Release 1 Build id 201009170705, and I think Ive got it configured correctly to do XDEBUG remote debugging using port 9000.  I say I emthinkem, because Ive had difficulty figuring out how to do that, and how to use Eclipse PDT in general.  But I did manage to get it configured and working for remote debugging of PHP code run by web pages served using XAMPP for Windows 1.7.3 on localhost 127.0.0.1, using port 9000.  The phpinfo output for the server on the laptop which PDT emisem able to debug is the same as above, except forp  precodexdebug.idekey       myusername     no value xdebug.remotehost  localhost       localhost xdebug.remotelog   no value        no value codepre  pIm pretty sure these differences are not related to the problem.  In fact, xdebug.idekey was originally root novalue on Linux, which I then changed to ECLIPSEDBGP by both editing php.ini and setting environment variable DBGPIDEKEY in the sudoed script that starts apache, in vain hope of getting things working.p  pIve got firewalls and a NAT router between the laptop and the Linux box.  So I am trying to use port forwarding through a PuTTY ssh tunnel to get the Linux XDEBUG talking to the Windows PDT.  Ive been using X11 forwarding with PuTTY for a couple of months with no problems at all.  I set up the tunnel in PuTTY with local port 9000 forwarded to port 9000 on the Linux box, and port 9000 on the Linux box forwarded to port 9000 on 127.0.0.1, the PuTTY tunnel panel showingp  precodeL9000  host...amazonaws.com9000 R9000  127.0.0.19000 codepre  pLooking at the PuTTY Event Log when the tunnel is set up, there appear to be no problemsp  precode20101116 180759 Local port 9000 forwarding to host...amazonaws.com9000 20101116 180759 Requesting remote port 9000 forward to 127.0.0.19000 20101116 180759 Remote port forwarding from 9000 enabled codepre  pBut then when I go to PDT and click Debug on a configuration that specifies the remote web server, PDT shows background activity in the lower right corner that gets stuck at 57, and if I click the icon to go to Progress view, that  shows Launching waiting for XDebug session.p  pWhen this happens, the PuTTY Event Log showsp  precode20101116 190542 Received remote port 9000 open request from 127.0.0.154474 20101116 190542 Attempting to forward remote port to 127.0.0.19000 20101116 190542 Forwarded port opened successfully 20101116 190542 Opening forwarded connection to host...amazonaws.com9000 20101116 190542 Forwarded connection refused by server Connect failed [Connection refused] 20101116 190542 Forwarded port closed codepre  pOn the Linux box, varlogsecure just showsp  precodeNov 16 190151 ip10194967 sshd[14555] error connectto host...amazonaws.com port 9000 failed. codepre  pIve checked my etcsshsshdconfig, and I think its okay, even changing it explicitly to AllowTcpForwarding yes, even though that is supposed to be the default.  In my web searches for a solution, I did come across one a hrefhttpwww.linuxquestions.orgquestionsslackware14sshtunnelsconnectionrefused610609linuxquestions postinga where the final reply says something rather cryptic about sshd needing to resolve a hostnamep  blockquote   pthis seemed to fix it   The hostname has always been domainserv, since I always   thought of my router as being domain.com...so after running   codehostname domain.comcode...bam It finally works...p      pI guess sometimes it is too simple. sshd had to be resolving domain.com   to my router, ergo the connection failed.p blockquote  pI sounds like this might be related to my problem, but it makes no sense to me, and since its pretty old, and the author didnt seem to understand it, either, I thought I would ask here rather than there...p  pI did notice that a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq2158479467590similar questiona was asked in this forum almost a year ago that got just one 0value response, presumably because the question was so lacking in detail as to be unanswerable.  I hope this one has enough information, and isnt so long, so that somebody can steer me right.  After reading the faqs and how to ask a question, it wasnt entirely obvious to me whether the correct use of the forum was to post something under that original poorlyasked but contentidentical question, or to post this new one  Im sure someone will let me know what was the right choice on that p  pIve been going nuts with this thing, and I suspect its something pretty obvious to someone with experience.

Negative 2498 pI thought Id get this question out there while I noodled on a solution on my own.p  pAfter having built out the bulk of an application, I have a last minute requirement to support readingwriting to an additional database 2 total, no known others.  I built the application using NHibernate, with Autofac supplying the DIIoC components.

Theoretically, I can continue to use this generic repository codeIRepositoryltgtcode for the second database so long as the session that gets passed to it is spawned from an appropriate SessionFactory, rightp  pWell, when the app starts, Autofac does its thing.

In any other NHib scenario, Id likely shove instances of the separate SessionFactories into a hash, and retrieve them as needed.  I dont want to have to rearchitect the whole thing as were fairly close to a major release.  So, Im guessing I need to modify at least the methods above so that I can independently configure two SessionFactories.

Negative 2498 pIm trying to implement WPF validation on a few text boxes. I want to be able to display the validation errors to the user with something more obvious than a tooltip, but more subtle than a dialog or messagebox. I settled on using the Popup class, rather than some built in textbox for displaying errors, since there are many different fields that need to be validated this way, and I want the feedback to be attached to the field in question. p  pThe problem Im experiencing is that the binding of the Popups child TextBox to the attached TextBoxs Validation.Errors property is not updated aggressively enough. As soon as there is an Error object, the text is updated and displayed i.e. Please enter a name. for an empty field but if the error changes i.e. the user enters invalid text the message in the popup stays the same... untilunless they enter valid input, at which point the popup disappears as desired.p  pIve done some debugging, and Ive found that while the validation rule is being called correctly and returning the proper results, the converter for the Popup is only called at the creation of the initial error. I guess what I am confused about is why the Popup gets updated only when the validation state goes from no errors to some errors, so to speak. Does anyone know a way to force the changes to Validation.Errors to be reflected in my Popups TextBox.Textp  pHeres a xaml example of what Ive written.p  precodeltTextBox NameMyTextBoxgt     ltTextBox.Textgt         ltBinding PathMyText UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged gt             ltBinding.ValidationRulesgt                 ltlocalMyTextBoxValidationRule gt             ltBinding.ValidationRulesgt         ltBindinggt     ltTextBox.Textgt ltTextBoxgt ltPopup NameMyPopup IsOpenBinding ElementNameMyTextBox,      PathValidation.HasError, ModeOneWaygt     ltBorder BorderThickness1 BorderBrushRed BackgroundWhitegt         ltTextBlock ForegroundRed Margin5 5 5 5              TextBinding ElementNameMyTextBox, PathValidation.Errors,              ConverterStaticResource errorsToMessageConvertergt     ltBordergt ltPopupgt codepre

Negative 2498 pI have a method that compares two byte arrays for equality, with the major caveat that it does not fail and exit early when it detects inequality.  Basically the code is used to compare CrossSite Request Forgery tokens, and avoid as much as possible the ability to use timing to hack the key.  I wish I could find the link to the paper that discusses the attack in detail, but the important thing is that the code I have still has a statistically measurable bias for returning sooner if the two byte arrays are equalalthough it is an order of magnitude better.  So without further ado, here is the codep  precodepublic static bool SecureEqualsbyte[] original, byte[] potential       They should be the same size, but we dont want to throw an      exception if we are wrong.     bool isEqual  original.Length  potential.Length     int maxLenth  Math.Maxoriginal.Length, potential.Length      forint i0 i lt maxLength i              byte originalByte  i lt original.Length  original[i]  byte0         byte potentialByte  i lt potential.Length  potential[i]  byte0          isEqual  isEqual ampamp originalByte  potentialByte           return isEqual  codepre  pThe difference in average timing between equal and unequal tokens is consistently 1025ms depending on garbage collection cycles shorter for unequal tokens.  This is precisely what I want to avoid.  If the relative timing were equal, or the average timing swapped based on the run I would be happy.  The problem is that we are consistently running shorter for unequal tokens.  In contrast, if we stopped the loop on the first unequal token, we could have up to an 80x difference in timing.p  pWhile this equality check is a major improvement over the typical eager return, it is still not good enough.  Essentially, I dont want any emconsistentem result for equality or inequality returning faster.  If I could get the results into the range where garbage collection cycles will mask any consistent bias, I will be happy.p  pAnyone have a clue what is causing the timing bias toward inequality being faster  At first I thought it was the ternary operator returning an access to the array or a constant if the arrays were of unequal size.  The problem is that I still get this bias if the two arrays are the same size.p  pNOTE As requested, the links to the articals on Timing Attacksp  ul lia hrefhttpcrypto.stanford.edudabopapersssltiming.pdf relnofollowhttpcrypto.stanford.edudabopapersssltiming.pdfa official paper, linked to from the blog post belowli lia hrefhttpcodahale.comalessonintimingattacks relnofollowhttpcodahale.comalessonintimingattacksa  talks about the failure in Javas libraryli lia hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTimingattack relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTimingattacka more general, but not as completeli ul

Negative 2498 pIve written a small Swing program that draws a head and when a JCheckBox instance is selectedunselected by the user a hat is drawn or removed from on top of the head. Im having some trouble taking the next step with this program  Id like to add a boolean field to the Head class that causes this component to listen to mouse events with a MouseListener. From there, Id like to use two methods to set this field to truefalse and render the remaining three methods lame ducks. Also, how would I change the paintComponent method so that if the boolean value is true the object is drawn with open eyes, and if its false, the head is drawn with the eyes closed Please provide any advice you have.

Negative 2498 pI have created an Axis2 web service from Netbeans and deployed it successfully in Tomcat 6 on my web server. When I use for instance SoapUI or Taverna to consume the web service, the server offers both HTTP and HTTPS methods to invoke it. However, using the HTTPS method renders a 404 error. Probably because there is a server admin panel running on port 8443, but that doesnt matter right now.p  pThe problem is that my web service clients default to using the HTTPS service. I figured the simplest thing I could do to get the basic service to work, would be to disable the HTTPS endpoint, as the HTTP version runs flawlessly and I dont need the added security. But now Ive spent hours on finding out how to do that, without success. The WSDL returned by Axis2 contains entries for HttpsSoap11Endpoint but the WSDL thats bundled in my .AAR file after the build does not.p  pDoes anybody know how to make Axis2 offer just HTTP endpointsp

The reason I need to have it this way is because the floated element is the menu, which doesnt contain any important text and is usually the same for many pages, so the content should be topmost in the code.p

Negative 2498 pI need to capture everything that i type on my keyboard and then store it in numerous ways. Id prefer it to be written on C for .Net, but anything will do really.p  pI have googled for that kind of information and ive seen like every question being replied with you seem like youre writing a keylogger we wont help you do that, we dont want to help hackers or script kiddies, topic closed. In some topics people ask for reasons to write a keylogger.p  pFirst of all, i dont understand, since when did hacking become bad Hacker is a person who is advanced with some kind of device, knows how to communicate with it on pro language, not a person who distributes malware or trojans or something. If hackers can do bad to computers, thats because computers are badly designed and software made by companies ike M or Apple sucks, not because hackers are bad. Make your software better and youd have no virus or hacker problems.p  pBut anyways, my reasons to write this keylogger are simplep  pRecently i became an owner of a Peregrine gaming glove. Its a very cool thing that allows you to issue commands by making gestures with your fingers, and at the same time, its a very slim glove so you can type with that hand with little discomfort. p  pAlso, i have found a nice program called AutoHotkey that can severely boost your productivity by making macros for like any action. You can bind any key to any other key or series of keys or commands.p  pProblem is, you cannot tell it just like that this is what im doing most and this is what im rarely using. Really, can you tell what key do you use more, page down or down Do you use alttab more frequently that escape or layout switch ctrlshift or altshift  I cannot tell that. I cannot tell which actions should I automate or switch to the more easy interface, without statistical data. p  pSO I want to write a program to run in the background and log everything i type. This program will then store first, second and third order histogram of my actions like, it will store how many times i pressed any single key, like enter, how many times i pressed a succession of two keys, like alt and then tab, and how many times i pressed a succession of three keys, like ctrl, alt and then delete or ctrl,shift and then escapep  pThen, after some time spent workingplayingwhatever, ill have information on what kind of actions should i try to bind to that interface the glove or automate with autohotkey program, to improve the speed of interacting with a PC.p  pIn other words, simple science experiment, just for fun and progress p

Negative 2498 pIn my web application, why do JSON.stringify serialize my Activitys Trackpoints array as a string Notice in the JSON representation on top that the trackpoints array is enclosed in quotes, rendering it as a string. The javascript object representation in the bottom shows clearly that trackpoints is an array.p  pWhen this serialized activity is passed as JSON in a POST to my Sinatra backend, Ruby parses its trackpoints as a string instead of an array of Trackpoint objects. The end result is a 500 server error, which is not what I expect.p  pPrecision for people unable to see the included image The trackpoints array is a property of a complex object. JSON.stringify encloses it in quotes while doing its job. When Ruby parses the whole serialized object, it interprets my array as a string instead of an array. Thats why I want to avoid those quotes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjc22m.png altTrackpoints array serialized with quotesp

Further analysis revealed that my webserver was adding codecode slashes to the JSON string and according to JSONLint.com, the string with slashes is invalid JSON.p  pThe JSON on my webserver shows up like thisp  precodeProductWalnut Pastry,SizeSlice,Quantity2,Price0 codepre  pWhy does this happen on my webserver, and what can I do to escape the strings I tried codejsondecodestrreplace,,GET[json],truecode but that didnt work eitherp
Negative 2498 pI am working on a PHP website, and I am moving it over to a new server. The new server I am moving to does not have CRON compatibility. To compensate for this I have devised a system using time formats and database tables and more to run my code instead.p  pWhat I am having a problem with is this bit of codep  precodeif lasttime lt pretime      newtime  strtotimenow      queryMysqlUPDATE time SET time.newtime. WHERE time.lasttime      includeonce grabbergrabber.php  codepre  pSpecifically its the codeincludeonce grabbergrabber.phpcode which is causing the problem. When the timer comes round and this code runs, it gets to the include and then the code stops, with no error provided, so the include fails. I have tried changing it to an codeexeccode but to be honest I dont completely understand how codeexeccode works and if it is the correct thing to do. This is how I used itp  precodeif lasttime lt pretime      newtime  strtotimenow      queryMysqlUPDATE time SET time.newtime. WHERE time.lasttime      grabber  base.grabbergrabber.php          execgrabber  codepre  pThis does not stop the code and seems to run but it doesnt actually work, if codegrabbergrabber.phpcode runs correctly then I get an email to confirm using the PHP codemailcode functionp  pIf anyone could help me solve this or shed some light that would be brilliant. Thanks.p
Negative 2498 pI dont know what this is called, so Ill try to give a pretty clear example...p  pSay we have 3 lists a, b, amp c We assign each of these lists a binary value. a  1, b  10, c  100 d would be 1000, etcp  pWe have 2 objects y amp z To tell which objects relate to which lists, we give it a binary value also. Say object y is 101. Since the first and third values are 1s, we know its related to list a and list c. If object z is 11, we know its related to lists a and b.p  pSomeone showed me how to do this programmatically some time ago, but I cant recall. Id like to do this sort of mapping in javascript. Anybody know how this is donep

Negative 2498 pIve got a class with generics which uses another class, which in return needs to know what instance of the initial class owns it  which causes problems  Let me give an examplep  precodepublic interface IFooltTgt    public interface IBar      IFooltIBargt Foo  get set    public class FooltTgt  IFooltTgt where T  IBar, new      private readonly T bar     public Foo              bar  new T Foo  this        class Bar  IBar      public IFooltIBargt Foo  get set   codepre  pThis doesnt work as Foo  this doesnt work  even if I try to cast this to IFoo compiles but fails at run time.

Negative 2498 pIn our ASP.NET Application, we have a feature that allows the use to write scripts in C or VB.NET code. These scripts are stored in the database and compiled at specified intervals, executing the code that is stored in these scripts.p  pThis works as long as the user is writing basic .NET code. Ofcourse our customers now request that theyre able to reference their own DLLs to allow the execution of specific code. This is acceptable for us and were creating a solution for this. However there is a specific scenario that we wish to avoid at all timesp  pstrongThe application is not allowed to copy the referenced DLL files into the BIN folder of the ASP.NET side, as this restarts the application and this is not supportedallowedstrongp  pIve been playing around with the CompilerOptions class and Ive noticed that youre able to set your referenced libraries there. From the information I could find on the MSDN sitep  ul liYou can set a emlibrary pathem using the following CompilerOptions  libpathltpathgt li liYou can add a reference like so CompilerOptions.ReferencedAssemblies.Addassembly name  li liYou can add a reference like so CompilerOptions.ReferencedAssemblies.Addfull path to assemblyli ul  pIn our scripts we also have the following mechanism in place users can define a References region in their code that contains paths to various custom DLLs needed to execute the script. An Example script could look like thisp  precoderegion References    CProgram FilesMailBeeMailBee.Net.dll   CProgram FilesCustomAppCustom.dll   System.IO.dll  endregion  namespace custom.script.space     class CustomScript  Script       [EntryPoint]      public voic run        do stuff       codepre  pThis would reference the System.IO assembly and the two custom DLLs specified. However with the current implementation, we would copy the custom DLLs to the GAC and then just add their name as reference to the compiler.p  pWould it be possible to disable the copy of the DLL and use full paths to these dlls to be referenced, without having them copied to the GACbin folder of the application And would it be possible to use the CompilerOptions to set the libpath and let all references point to thisp  pThe reason why we dont want to copy the Dlls and restart the applications, is because we have multiinstance applications, several customers on a single instance, and we cant simply restart an application.p  pI hope the question is clear on what Im trying to achieve...p
Negative 2498 pI will start off by saying that this feels like it should be easy... but its not entirely obvious to me.  I am trying to use the BrentOptimizer to find local minima and maxima of a function.  I have an idea of the periodicity of these, and I feel like I should be able to use the BracketFinder to bracket the optimums and then send that off to the BrentOptimizer.p  pHer is the documentation a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgmathapi2.2orgapachecommonsmathoptimizationunivariateBracketFinder.html relnofollowhttpcommons.apache.orgmathapi2.2orgapachecommonsmathoptimizationunivariateBracketFinder.htmlap  pSo for a simple case, considerp  precodefx  sinx codepre  pWe know that there is a max at Pi2 and a min at 3Pi2.  If I were starting at zero and moving along the function, how would I go looking for that root at Pi2  It really comes down to the constructor arguments and the initial points.  Are there any best practices assuming you know a little bit about the shape of your function that I can use to set these parameters in a reasonable wayp  pThanksp
Negative 2498 pMost of the fields in a dpkg Debian control file are straightforward. The tricky one is determining the list of dependencies Depends.

Negative 2498 pIm trying to put together a database in SQL Server Management Studio 2008 which will manage the data without having to programatically process the data but Im having some issues at the moment.p  pI have a main table called person, this table holds core data about a person and this is linked to a second table called customer in which they are included if they wish to have transaction permissions.

Negative 2498 pI am containing the primary object with most of the features within a helper object that will provide convenience methods.  I have only an Interface available, aside from a returned object with that interface from a factory method.  I am thinking a good way to extend this object is composition, but the problem that my superclass must implement the primary objects interface, which would be about 600 lines of stub code.p  pClearly an uncomplicated but verbose solution would be to fill out all the stubs so they merely call the primary objects methods.  Is there a better way than this in Java  In other languages Im familiar with, there would be ways to do automatic delegation for methods that are not implemented in the helper object.p  pExamplep  pre class Helper implements Interface      Primary primary      HelperPrimary primary          primary  primary           void helper          doStuff            500 lines of this     void stub          primary.stub       pre  pNotep  pOriginal plan was to just use regular expressions to replace all the stub TODOs in Eclipse with the actual calls.

Negative 2498 pWhat happens when a superclass has a field marked final, but a subclass overrides hides this field Final doesnt stop this, does it  The specific example Im working on is a Building class, from which different kinds of buildings inherit.

What I really want are static variables of cost.

Negative 2498 pI have a Windows Forms application. It loads assemblies with the extension .Plugin.dll with Assembly.LoadFile. One of these plugins calls into another assembly dll. That dll eventually throws a ValidationException exception. The method that throws the exception is in a class that inherits from IDataErrorInfo. This class is a class that is contained in a Linq to SQL class .dbml. In the plugin I call DataContext.SubmitChanges. This is wrapped in a trycatch block. This causes my business logic to validate the data before submitting to the database in the OnValidate override. The result that I see is that after the ValidationExeption is thrown, the debugger stops at the bottom of the OnValidate method indicating that an unhandled exception has occured. If I continue to run the app my catch block is executed. That is what I wanted in the first place, but why am i getting an unhandled exception when it truly is handledp

Negative 2498 pI am working on my senior project at university and I have a question. My advisor and other workers dont know much more on the matter so I thought I would toss it out to SO and see if you could help.p  pWe want to make a website that will be hosted on a server that we are configuring. That website will have buttons on it, and when visitors of that website click a certain button we want to register an event on the server. We plan on doing this with PHP.p  pOnce that event is registered this is where we get lost, we want to communicate with a serial device on a remote computer. We are confident we can set up the PHP eventlistener for the button press, but once we have that registered, how do we signal to the remote computerconnected via T1 linerouters to communicate with the serial device What is this sequence of events referred to as The hardest thing for us when researching it is that we are not certain what to search forp  pWe have a feeling that a python script could be running on the server, get signals from the PHP listener, and then communicate with the remote PC. The remote PC could also be running a python script that then will communicate with our serial device. Again, most of this makes sense, but we are not clear on how we communicate between Python and PHP on the web server or if this is possible.p  pIf any one could give me some advice on what to search for, or similar projects I would really appreciate it. Thanks,p

Negative 2498 pI am writing some code which can generate Exceptions deep in the stack, and I have a layer nearer the top which catches these exceptions and sends them off for processing by an error handling module.  What I would like is for the error handling module to be able to print the stack trace into its error log, but Im finding it difficult to work out what the way to do this is.p  pSome notes on the backgroundp  ul lipThe code is multithreaded, so Im not certain of the behaviour of sys.lasttracebackpli lipI have tried capturing the stack in the constructor of the exception itself.  sys.lasttraceback is sometimes None in this case since it only exists in the case of unhandled exceptions, and not always correct.  I am currently toying with usingp  pself.stack  traceback.formatstack[2]pli ul  pin the constructor of the exception, and while this looks promising in terms of information, it doesnt feel like the right way to do itp  ul lipAll examples of how to do this that Ive been able to find show how to print the stack trace in the except block, not in some later error handling module, and this appears to be different in behaviour from what I want.  see, for example, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1156023printcurrentcallstackinpythonPrint current call stack in Pythonapli lipIve mined the traceback module in the python docs httpdocs.python.orglibrarytraceback.html, and havent been able to figure out whether this even does what I want.  It seems mostly concerned with formatting tracebacks as you might retrieve from sys.lasttraceback.  It has some examples of usage, and none of them line up with what Im trying to do.pli ul  pI dont believe that Im the first person to ever want to do this, so I must be missing something.  Any pointers in the right direction much appreciated.p

Negative 2498 pI have a class of images called glyphs that appear through out my site. Once upon a time they were all called just called codeglyphcode. They used to only appear in one box. That box was a specific size and I used a javascript method to make sure the text always fit and the glyphs were always about the same height as the rest of the text. This was easy to do and the glyphs started off with a default due to my style sheet.p  pNow, Ive decided to include multiple boxes per page with variable amounts of text. Each box gets sized independently. Ive tried delaying the sizing routine, but this is highly reliant on a users connection speed. If I dont run the sizing routine then things dont look right at all, so Id at least like to pick a default starting size for everything. Of course, you cant size stuff with javascript until it has been loaded. Snake eats tail.p  pSo basically, now that I have more than one box, each glyph gets a class glyph1, glyph2, etc. This number can go as large as the number of user submitted items on my site. How does CSS handle this These items basically need two class names as far as I can see. But Im pretty sure thats not allowed.p  pWhat I need Set all images classes that begin with glyph to 1emp  pThis doesnt exist, right glyphp  pAlso,  is probably bad to use in a css class name, huhp

I saw in some blogs some overriding of method codenewcode, of class Class.p  pSo Class behaves as a class, but its instances are classes. So it seems we have a circle, it looks likes class Class is an instance of itself.p  pIm clearly missing a point here. What is the origin of class Classp  pHeres an example thats confusing mep  precodeclass Class   def new     something   end end codepre  pBut keyword codeclasscode implies an instance of class Class. So how do this workp

Negative 2498 pI have a little problem creating new list items rows with the help of a workflow in a list in SharePoint Server 2010. Here are the facts.p  h2What I want to doh2  ol liCreate an item in a main list. While creating this item, the user has to enter a number which specifies the number of list items that should be created in a secondary list.li liWhen the item in the main list is created, a workflow starts.li liThis workflow should create the number of list items in the secondary list, that the user specified before.li ol  h2What I have so farh2  pAs Im restricted to work with SharePoint Designer, I have no possibility to create a for loop which, I have to say, is quite weak and annoying beacause it would simplify a lot of things. However, what I have so far is the following and it works to a certain degreep  ol liThe workflow on the main list ul liThis one starts when an item is created or an existing one is updated.li liIt creates a new list item on the secondary list. Amongst others, it passes the ID of the item that was just created, the number of items which should be created in the secondary list, and a counter value initial value is 1.li ulli liThe workflow on the secondary list ul liIncreases the counter value by 1li liSaves the ID of the corresponding list item in the main list.li liSaves the number of items which should be created in the secondary list.li liAnd if the counter is smaller as the items which should be created updates the counter of the corresponding item in the main list thats why I passed the ID before.li liAs the item in the main list is updated, the workflow starts again with the new counter value.li ulli ol  pActually, its the same principle described in a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSsharepointworkflowthread77703498e3f04df4ace5dade2f25d157 relnofollowthis forum contributiona.p  h2The Problemh2  pNow here is the Problem Despite the fact that the loop works, the problem is that only a maximum of 5 items are created in the secondary list, but I never declared that anywhere. For example, if I create an item in the main list and I enter a number of 10, the counter stops at 5 and only 5 items are created in the secondary list. But if I enter a number that is lower than 5, everything works perfect. For example, if I want to create 3 items in the secondary list, it only creates 3 items and the counter stops at 3, as it should.p  h2The Questionh2  pAs I am quite new to SharePoint Im coming from the PHPSQLWorld, where  as you know  loops are abolutely no problem, my question is if there are any predefined limitations in regard of creating list items by a workflow, and if yes, how and where I could change them if that is possible.p  pAlso, if you know any other ways how to accompoish the task, please let me know ... Im very curious. Thank you very much in advancep  pKind regards, Mikep

I understand it would be something like this.p  precodedef initializeuser   user  User.new   if user.admin     can manage, Article   else     can read, Article   end end codepre  pBut this is just for the admin and guest user, Im not sure how to differentiate a guest user from a logged in user because it creates a new User object when user is empty. Ive seen that the code should be something like this codecan [edit, destroy], Article, userid gt user.idcode, but Im not sure how this would fit in the initialize method.p  pAnd one last question, if I only define a codecan read, Articlecode on guests, would it block the other actions such as create and update, like white listing the read actionp  pAny help would be appreciated. Thanks a lotp

Negative 2498 pI am trying to do a footer which can seamlessly integrate with most CMSes, so it uses list items and nested lists within them, menu style.

This is causing the anchors widths to go outside the codelicode items that host them, and when I do codeoverflow autocode on the codelicode items, I just get scrollbars instead of expanding to the anchors width.p  pThis is causing the problem on the far right, where the last item in the list Events is having the rounded background go beyond the boundary of the containing codedivcode and codeulcode into the About Us link which should not have the background. Again trying codeoverflow autocode just gives me scrollbars. I also have the clearfix with after on both elements.p  pHow can I make the links width just the width of their containing codeltligtcode so that I dont have that overflow on the right which I am getting with codewidth 100codep  pHow can I make the wrapper codeltdivgtcode and codeltulgtcode expand to contain the width horizontally, without getting those nasty scrollbarsp  pThanksp  pP.S.

Negative 2498 pIm currently writing a compiler front end for personal education on the topic and Ive run into a problem concerning the way I handle BNF definition in C through operator overloading.p  pCurrently my setup is as followsp  pRule.hp  precodeclass Rule  public     ChainRule operatorgtgtRuleamp right     OrRule operatorRuleamp right     KleeneRule operator     OptionalRule Ruleoperator      virtual bool parseTokenListiteratoramp begin, TokenListiterator end  0  codepre  pRule.cppp  precodeChainRule RuleoperatorgtgtRuleamp right      return ChainRulethis, ampright   OrRule RuleoperatorRuleamp right      return OrRulethis, ampright   KleeneRule Ruleoperator      return KleeneRulethis   OptionalRule Ruleoperator      return OptionalRulethis  codepre  pChainRule, OrRule, KleeneRule, OptionalRule and EmptyRule are defined trivially like sop  precodeclass ChainRule  public Rule  private     Rule next     Rule this  public     ChainRule     ChainRuleRule this, Rule right      bool parseTokenListiteratoramp begin, TokenListiterator end override  codepre  pEach subclass of Rule obviously defines a resonable implementation of parse. Using these classes I can define my grammar as followsp  precodeOrRule assignmentexp    logicalorexp                          unaryexp gtgt StringRule gtgt assignmentexp                             codepre  pNow heres the problem Each overloaded operator returns a new object by value. This means that whenever I use operator or operator from the Rule class, these pointers will be garbage once I return from the call to operator or operator since the stack has been cleaned up and the objects are gone.p  pNeither can I use pass by value in the constructors for my Rule subclasses since this would not allow me to define recursive grammars.p  pSo Im left with no option of passing objects by value, and no option of passing objects by pointers. Can anyone point me to a solution that would not force me to define my grammar like sop  precodeStringRule s  StringRule OrRule assignmentexp ChainRule temp1  s gtgt assignmentexp ChainRule temp2  unaryexp gtgt temp1 assignmentexp  logicalorexp  temp2 codepre  pP.S. I am aware of the various parser generators and Boost.Spirit, but my goal is to write my own parser.p

Negative 2498 pCurrently im trying to display some dynamic PDF files in my Webview. These PDFs are loaded from a database and streamed the the browser, this works fine in all the PC browsers and even in the Android browser.  I tried contenttype applicationpdf and even applicationoctetstream, but both give the same result.p  pI tried downloading the PDF with HttpClient and HttpURLConnection but everything I try the getContentLength and getInputStream keep saying its only 100B.p  pSo when I startup a PDF intent Android tells me that its not a correct PDF file.p  pOnly when I use a downloadListener and put the URL into a intent without downloading first the Webview opens the default browser wich automaticly starts download right away.p  pSo the way I present a PDF seems to work. But the way I try to get the stream from the URL does not.p  pLoads of questions about this topic, sadly very little correctworking answers...p  pKinds Regardsp  pEDIT The URL is not www.xxx.comfile.pdf, but its www.xxx.comfile.phpid12345 So when I open the URL in the Mobile Browser the browser starts downloading it, but the download code in my Webview just can seem to seefind a file.p

Update a specific field with results from a complex subquery doing some text manipulationp  pStep 2. grab an email address from email field in TableA row 2a. look up user table 2b. if email exists get ID and update UserId in TableA row 2c. if email doesnt exists  INSERT new record into User table, get ID back and update UserId in TableA rowp  pStep 1 and 2 dont have to be done at the same time, these tasks can be split into separate Data Flows as they are unrelated.p  pI can write this all using a cursor  pretty straightforward, but I know as a general rule using cursors is frowned upon.p  pI have written a pure sql script for Step 1 above, using the new MERGE function. The sub query it uses calls a View which in turn uses a scaler function to do some complex text manipulation. After this ran via SSIS for 1h 12m SSIS bombed out due to tembDB.log running out of disk space.p  pNot sure if my query was the cause of tembDB getting out of control or something else in the SSIS package which ran earlier How can I tellp  pSo has anyone got any tips on best tools within SSIS to achieve both Step 1 and 2 abovep

Negative 2498 pWe are in process of converting our site over to Drupal 6.2.8 for now from a staticcustom jsp site. Last year, we had a dynamic map see here a hrefhttparchive.summer.harvard.eduhelpdirections.jsp relnofollowhttparchive.summer.harvard.eduhelpdirections.jspa p  pKey behavior was that when you selected something from one dropdown the other filtered itself to show legal values, and immediately updated the map to show the selected building. Directions were a plus, but those are not planned for the Drupal version. p  pMy dataview is structured like so I have a building content type which contains building name, type, latlng, and location data. I have two openlayers views  one for the map data, which accepts a nid as the argument and filters against the building node, and has exposed filters for type and name. Another is the map view itself which is set to use exposed filter in block and accepts a nid as the argument. p  pIve been able to get pretty close using OpenLayers and views, but I have found some stumbling blocks along the way. Specifically, if I use exposed filters for my type and building dropdowns, I need to submit the form and reload the page in order to refresh the map. p  pI was really hoping that Id be able to maintain the ajaxy behavior from the old map in the transition to Drupal. So Ive thought of some options, but none  are working great yetp  ul lipSince the map view itself takes a nid argument, maybe I dont need a filter at all. What if I made a different view that just had select inputs in it, each of which had some kind of onselect that sent the nid to the map  I could build them w jquery UI autocompletes using a view as a json datasource, for instancepli lipMaybe theres some kind of way to use panels to pass arguments between views  But can it do it dynamically without reloading the page pli lipAm I just going about this all wrong, should I go back to customcoding my map clientsidepli ul

Negative 2498 pI just started profiling an application that does some codelog linearcode interpolation, and I noticed something strange when calling codeMath.logcode and codeMath.expcode inside each other.

However, when I put a breakpoint in both codeMath.expcode and codeMath.logcode which are just calls to codeStrictMathcode codenative staticscode, the execution is only interrupted in codeMath.expcode, not in codeMath.logcode. p  pNow I thought it could be that codejavacode does not debug calls within calls from static methods, but when I call codeMath.expMath.log10code so the other way around, the same behaviour is observed, only stopping in exp, not in log...p  pAnybody able to reproduce this Why is this happeningp  pstrongEDITstrong It seems like its not debugging the Math.log function at all.

Negative 2498 pI was learning about algorithms and time complexity, and this quesiton just sprung into my mind.p  pWhy do we only analyze an algorithms time complexityp  pMy question is, shouldnt there be another metric for analyzing an algorithm Say I have two algos A and B. p  pA takes 5s for 100 elements, B takes 1000s for 100 elements. But both have codeOncode time. p  pSo this means that the time for A and B both grow slower than codecncode grows for two emseparateem constants codecc1code and codecc2code. But in my very limited experience with algorithms, weve always ignored this constant term and just focused on the growth. But isnt it very important while choosing between my given example of A and B Over here codec1ltltc2code so Algo A is much better than Algo B.p  pOr am I overthinking at an early stage and proper analysis will come later on What is it calledp  pOR is my whole concept of time complexity wrong and in my given example both cant have codeOncode timep

Negative 2498 pIm developing an IOS app that reads Arduino serial output via redpark cable. In the Arduino side, it uses Serial.println to send out strings. The string is in the format of 12.34x334.45x0.34x123x33. Essentially its a combination of doubles with x in between as a special split character. My initial thought was that in the app side, it would get the Arduino output line by line so I would just use p  precodeNSString testString 12.34x334.45x0.34x123x33 NSArray array  [testString componentsSeparatedByStringx] codepre  pto get a NSArray contains 12.34  334.45 0.34 123 and 33.p  pSomehow after reading questions and answers posted here, I figured out there is no way for redpark sdk to treat the Arduino output line by line, its always in a X bytes basis.p  pIn order to parse the Arduino output string correctly, what should i do Would it be a good idea to add leading and tailing 0 to my double data to make the original string to be sent in a fixed length i.e. 03.45x45.50x02.30 to make it 17 bytes and try to read 17 bytes of data using redpark sdkp

Does this single thread apply to all tabs open in a browser windowp  pIn other words, if different JavaScript code are running in different tabs, they are all being executed using a single threadp  pIn addition, what happens when you have multiple windows of the same browser open and each window contains multiple tabsp  pFinally, does the answers to the above depend on browser vendorversion etcp
Negative 2498 pThis is a homework assignment I was assigned in my Database book. Basically I am supposed to tell which of these are functional dependencies and which are multivalue dependencies, say if it is in BCNF or 4NF, and then come up with a better design aka another table if needed so that the tables are in both BCNF and 4NF. Here is what I know or think I know at least so farp  pFunctional Dependancy X determines one and only one Y  XYp  pMultivalue Dependancy X determines multiple Ys      xYp  pCandidate Key A unique column that can be used as a primary keyp  pPrimary Key A unique candidate key Selected the best candidate keyp  h2PERSONALTRAINERSESSIONh2  p[Columns]p  pTrainer, TrainerPhone, TrainerEmail, TrainerFee, ClientLastName, ClientFirstName, ClientPhone, ClientEmail, TrainingDate, TrainingTimep  hr  pNow, I know I am supposed to narrow my focus when figuring out these dependencies to only the columns and data supplied by the tables instead of in general, but there doesnt seem to be any clear dependency relation to me. For example just take the column Trainer. Trainer could determine the email or something similar I suppose...but that wouldnt be a clear and concise connection would it p  pLikewise in terms of candidate keys.....TrainerEmail, TrainerPhone, ClientEmail, and ClientPhone all seem like possible candidate keys to me. Both phone numbers and emails are unique in real life, but I would imagine that phone numbers might be unique only to a certain country while emails are unique worldwide. So which would be a good primary key for the tablep  pMaybe my thinking isnt correct but the homework said to list functional and multivalued dependencies first and then reconfigure the tables so I guess Im missing something somewhere.p  pAny ideas on how to go about this the right way would be appreciated Dp  p EDIT Ok so Ive changed this table into 3.p  h2TRAINERh2  pTrainerID, Trainer, TrainerPhone, TrainerEmail, TrainerFeep  h2CLIENTh2  pClientID, ClientLastName, ClientFirstName, ClientPhone, ClientEmailp  h2TRAININGSESSIONh2  pTrainerIDforeign key, ClientIDforeign key, TrainingDate, TrainingTimep  pWould this make more sense Perhaps it would make more sense to use a single composite key.p

Negative 2498 pAt work, were developing a RESTful application where the data layer will be handled by Hibernate. But were not sure how to handle updates on entities.p  pWere planning to do the followingp  p1 client requests an entity by id br 2 Hibernate loads the entity, the requested fields always with the version are copied to a DTO that is converted to JSON and sent to the clientbr 3 Client manages some fields and sends the entity with version number back to the server.br 4 Server receives the JSON that is converted to a DTO.br  5 Corresponding entity is loaded from Hibernate and the DTOs props are copied to the entity.p  p The entity is always overwritten even if the version number of the client was set. Does this mean that we always have to check the version number of the client against the version number of the loaded instance by ourselves instead of Hibernate doing thisp  pIn a regular application with sessions, the detached instance is saved in the HttpSession. Whenever the client updates the entity, the instance is retrieved from the HttpSession and some attributes are updated. Whenever Hibernate commits the update, a ObjectStaleException will be thrown if the version number is lt the current version number.p  pThe problem here is that we dont have any Http session because were trying to be RESTful.p  pIs there a generic solution for handling optimistic locking in RESTful applications instead of checking version numbers by ourselvesp

I have the name bound to a ComboBox, and the phone and other fields bound to textblocks so that they display the info of whichever customer is selected in the combobox.  This is done in XAML.p  pWhat I need to add, though, is the ability to addupdatedelete customers from the existing list, and have them be addedupdateddeleted in the XML file.  What Im thinking is that I cant do this just in XAML, and will need to somehow read the XML into a List with a class of Customer with all the properties that match the fields in the XML document.  Is that correct  And if so, what is the simplest way to be able to do this  Right now Im reading on LINQ to XML, trying to figure out how to do that, but before I go there, Im wondering if thats the simplest way to do it.p  pThe project Im working on at the moment is for work, where development is just something I do occasionally, but to know how to do this would be handy for a Windows Phone application idea to update one of my apps.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2498 pI am VERY new to jMeter but Im trying to create a performance test for a web application I built. p  pThe only problem is that the server is behind a Digest Authentication form and I know that jMeter doesnt support this type of Authentication directly, is there a way I can manipulate the HTTP Header Manager to handle Digest Authentication Im very new to this, so I dont know how to properly create this header information if it was even possible. Can anyone offer any help Thanks.p  pIs there perhaps another solution out therep  pThank you for any responses.p  pSOLUTION EDIT I was making a fools error. For future readers, when you enter your Base URL in the HTTP Authorization Manager make sure you enter example.com rather than www.example.com. Also I left the Domain and Realm blank and it still worked with only the Base URL, username, and password.p

Negative 2498 pIm currently working on fixing some iOS 7 display issues on a legacy app which was not built with ARC, and have run into some inconsistent behaviour with the codedealloccode method between iOS versions 6 amp 7. I cant find any other mention of these changes in any documentation or community discussions, so I wonder if anyone here could shed some light on whats happening herep  pMy previous code, which works in iOS6, looks like thisp  precodeinterface MyViewController property retain AdHandler adHandler end  implementation MyViewController  synthesize adHandler  adHandler   id initWithAdHandlerAdHandleranAdHandler      self  [super init]     adHandler  [anAdHandler retain]     return self    voiddealloc          [super dealloc]      [adHandler release]     adHandler  nil   ...  end codepre  pWhen stepping through the code in iOS 6, Ive found that after the codedealloccode statement, code[adHandler retainCount]code is still positive, and the object is still available.p  pIn iOS 7 however, after the codedealloccode statement, coderetainCountcode has somehow hit zero, and the codeadHandlercode object has been codedealloccoded, and therefore my call to codereleasecode causes an codeEXCBADACCESScode.p  pI can fix this simply by moving my code[adHandler release]code call to before the codedealloccode call, but my question is why is this happening Why is codedealloccode releasing objects that it has no responsibility for Is there any documentation anywhere on why dealloc behaviour has changed in this wayp

I do want to fill in the method stubs, but upon changing the uml and generating code again, my method will be wiped and replaced with NotImplementedException again.

Applying messages.create method captured and preserved the unicode code point so it could be interpreted by the mobile device. p  pFor the fix, I applied Robs recommendation primarily to the last two lines of the code by replacing response.sms and the return with the client.messages.create and passing in the message variable to the body parameter. I also applied the u for unicode to all strings assigned to the message variable as well as added emoji code pointsimages to the messages. These made texting emoji work.

Negative 2498 pI have a solution with .NET projects and a setup projectVisual Studio Installer 2010. My previous version of the same project was 1.7.9 and the new version is 1.8.4. I also create a shortcut on the desktop to one application in my MSI. I changed all the versions in the assemblyinfo.cs and also changed the product version in the Setup Project, the product code got changed automatically and the upgrade code is the same. The problem Im facing is that the Targetdir is updated with 1.8.4 files. But on the desktop I see 2 shortcuts 1.7.9 amp 1.8.4 and in control panel I see two versions of the same application. I have set the RemovePreviousVersion flag to true and also set the DetectNewerVersion to true. Can someone please help me out with this After changing the assemblyinfo file why isnt it upgrading properlyp

Negative 2498 pIve Googled the underlying question of how to store an image in the database and found many examples.  However, all of the answers Im seeing for example a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles437937SaveandRetrieveImagefromaSQLServerDatabase relnofollowthisa, seem to use a SQLCommand as the solution whether they are using the older image type, text, or suggesting VARCHARMAX.  I am using SQL 2008 and SQL 2012p  pIm having trouble incorporating this into my app since I have a legacy dll which will do some other work, and then store my image.  I want to wrap this into a SQL transaction.  The challenge is that the DLL is essentially a blackbox to me since I cannot change the source code. The Dll exposes a parameter for an optional SQL statement it can run as part of its transaction.p  pThe structure of the DLL is something like thisp  precodePublic Class MyClass     Public Property ExtraSQL as string     Public Function DoWork       Dim sMainSQL as String       Start A transaction       ExecutesMainSQL       If ExtraSQL ltgt  Then         ExecuteExtraSQL       End If       If OK Then Commit Transaction     End Function End Class codepre  pMy goal is to feed a SQL string into property ExtraSQL, but Im not sure how to do this as all the examples are indicating something SqlCommand.ParametersImage.Value  byteArray.  Im getting the image data from a web service.  Over its life cycle, its formatted as an Image, a base64 Encoded string, a memorystream and a byte array, so converting between the types is not the problem.  Im just unclear on the cleanest syntax for doing this.  Is it best to just take my original base64 string and do something likep  precodeINSERT INTO tblImage ImageData Values Base64 blah blah codepre  pand then whenever I read the image back out do thisp  precodePublic Function Base64ToImageByVal base64String As String As System.Drawing.Image     Dim img As System.Drawing.Image  Nothing      Try         Convert Base64 string to byte array         Dim btImage As Byte  Convert.FromBase64Stringbase64String         Dim ms As New IO.MemoryStreambtImage, 0, btImage.Length          ms.WritebtImage, 0, btImage.Length         img  System.Drawing.Image.FromStreamms, True     Catch ex As Exception      End Try      Return img End Function codepre  pI would appreciate any supporting links, examples, and advice.

I need to find the minimum sized bounding box that covers all areas that are covered by n of the m rectangles.p  pA dirty way of doing this is to paint a canvas that covers the area of all the targets. This is Omk where m is the number of rectangles and k is the number of pixels per rectangle. However since k is much greater than m I think there is a better solution out there.p  pThis feels like a dynamic programming problem...but I am having trouble figuring out the recursion.p  pSolution which is better but still not greatp  pSort the start and end points of all the rectangles in the X direction Omlogm, iterate and find the x positions that may have over n rectangles, Om loop. For each x position that may have over n rectangles, take the rectangles at that position and sort the starts and stops at that position Omlogm. Find the region of overlap, keep track of the bounds that way. Overall, Om2logm.p

Negative 2498 pI am working with a Java program that calls an external batch file and passes in an array of commands. I have a loop in the batch file that looks like thisp  precodeset paramCount0 for x in  do      set A paramCount1     set list[paramCount]x  codepre  pThe parameters are a bunch of directories, stored as strings, like thisp  precodeString[] commands  cmd.exe,                      C,                      CUsersuserDocuments,                       CUsersuserPictures,                       CUsersuserVideos codepre  pAs you can see, my for loop is supposed to loop through the list of the arguments passed to the batch file  and emulate an array within the script Since the first two elements in the command array are used to start the command process, that only leaves the directories to be looped through. The program was working just fine until the other day, when I suddenly started getting an error saying the followingp  precodeEnvironment variable list[ not defined codepre  pI had not made any changes to the batch file at all and it seemed to stop working for no reason.

Negative 2498 pI have a perfectly working setup for hunspell with emacs flyspell using p  precodegerman  [[alpha]] [[alpha]] [] t d deDEframi  nil utf8 codepre  pas dictionary definition for ispelldictionaryalist.p  pGerman Umlaute are no problem as long as the main dict deDEframi contains them. However, as soon as I put a word with german Umlaute like Bestrzenste in the personal dictionary of hunspell, it is not recognized as being correct whereas all other added words that contain no german Umlaut are well recognized as being correct. p  pOn top of this, if I check the personal dictionary of hunspell all words appear there nicely in proper utf8 encoding. Whats even more is that hunspell, if executed on the command line with the only option d deDEframi does recognize words with Umlaute and e.g. Bestrzenste is reported as being correct.p  pSo I guess the trouble is caused by ispell or flyspell. Might this be a bug concerning only lookups in the personal dictionary.

Negative 2498 pI have a Fragment, and once the user presses OK, an Item is added to my database and its ID is added to the ArrayAdapter. Immediately after, the adapter tries to draw the view, but the first time it tries to get its attributes, it returns a null HashMap it gets drawn properly the following times.p  pIs there a way to make sure the item is in the table before trying to get its attributes Even putting the attribute retrieval into a while loop until it returns a notnull HashMap doesnt work so it doesnt look to be an issue of time. p

Negative 2498 pSo I am dealing with networking with cookie authentication. If I get a 401 or 406 for Unauthorized, then I know the cookie has expired valid for 1 HR, so I login with a stored token to get a new cookie.

Negative 2498 pI am developing an application that should be able to write to a virtual serial port and receive data through the same port from remote clients over network.p  pThe application runs on a linux server.

Negative 2498 pokay, its a general question, is it possible to make a web installer  a single apk file hosted on the play store or app store which on execution, download the code and resources from my own web server, the apk file will just act like a downloader or something like that for an app on Play Store or in App Store the main concern is, I dont want some crackers to access and break into the app for the premium version of the app.p  phave anyone tried or heard of this kinda app distribution or any appdevelopers use this method to deliver the app guess some games dop  pPS. web installers have some advantages of controlling the older versions and also can reduce the apk file size as I guess the low pixel density resources only need to be delivered to devices with low density displays. ie, the resourcesicons and stuff for a low end device does not need to be delivered to a high or middle or extra high end device and vice versa. plus developer dont need to worry about offline app transfers thus each download can be counted. but a disadvantage of heavy use of server.p  pthanks, for any views, guidelines or suggestions.

I know what components are present within this file, but I have seen them laid out in many different ways. p  pA lot of the components of an interface file are pretty obvious like the codeimportcode, codeclasscode, etc. But for something like the codeprotocolcode and codeinterfacecode declarations it can be different. I have seen people declare a new protocol above the interface declaration with its implementation of methods belowp  precodeprotocol MyNewClassDelegate  interface MyNewClass  UIViewController   Properties and Methods  end  protocol MyNewClassDelegate ltNSObjectgt   voidmethod  end codepre  pThe other way that Ive seen it is by just having the entire codeprotocolcode declaration and implementation above the codeinterfacecode statement. So itd be something like thisp  precodeprotocol MyNewClassDelegate ltNSObjectgt   voidmethod  end  interface MyNewClass  UIViewController  Properties and Methods  end codepre  pI have also seen it setup where one protocol is declared and implemented above the interface while another one is also declared and implemented below. p  pMy question is which one is preferred or is a standard in the industry Is there some kind of way you organize it based around what its functionality accomplishes p

This was all working fine in Keynote 9.  p  pHas anyone  else discovered this bug and found a workaround  I can export my slides to PDF, but the web HTML version was much nicer.  p

I use outputs in codeBcodes constructor and after codeDcode has been completely constructed to keep track of whats going on. Everything works fine, when I compile the above example with g4.8.1. It printsp  precode99 Final 99 codepre  pbecause codeBcodes constructor is called once from the most derived class codeDcode and that also determines the final value of codexcode.p  pNow comes the strange part If I change the linep  precodeD  B99, B1, B2  codepre  pto the new uniform initialization syntax, i.e.p  precodeD  B99, B1, B2  codepre  pstrange things happen.

Negative 2498 pSo Im currently working on a small project named dungeon crawl, where the user controls a char, player, and tries to reach another char, treasure.

Negative 2498 pI have a windows form that I design to show pictures. The listbox has All the peoples names that come from sql database.

Here are codes that I used so farp  precode private void listBoxAllNamesSelectedIndexChangedobject sender, EventArgs e      string imagelocation  CDatabaseAlumniPicture listBoxAllNames.SelectedItem.ToString .jpg         pictureBoxAlumnus.ImageLocation  imagelocation         pictureBoxAlumnus.SizeMode  PictureBoxSizeMode.AutoSize codepre  pIn my AlumniPicture folder, I have all pictures. The pictures file names are same as their fullNames. I dont know if there is a better approach. This is what I come up with and it doesnt work. Thank you for your replies in advance. p
Negative 2498 pThere are a few other Questions on how to convert Enums and what happens if the value parsed is outofrange, like inp    pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic enum SomeTypes      SomeType1  1,     SomeType2  2,     SomeType3  3   public class SomeClass      ...     var inRange  SomeTypes 1     var outOfRange  SomeTypes 5     ...  codepre  pGoing outofrange will not produce any error. But I found the hard way that if you try to serializedeserialize an enum with an outofrange value youll get weird errors. For example, I was getting something like p  blockquote   perror parsing the message or timeout exceededp blockquote  pwhich kept me looking for other reasons than the enum outofrange.p  pSuggestions to handle this are by the means of the codeEnum.IsDefinedcode. That seems to work quite nicely, but then theres this rather bold warning on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms229025VS.90.aspx relnofollowmsdnap  blockquote   pDo not use System.Enum.IsDefinedSystem.Type,System.Object for enumeration range checks as it is based on the runtime type of the enumeration, which can change from version to version.p blockquote  pSo, my question is, can we safely use codeEnum.IsDefinedcode or what is the correct way to check if the value of an enum is outofrange without using the codeEnum.IsDefinedcodep
Negative 2498 pThe codeACPROGCXXcode macro checks for possible C compilers and in the event of failure, happily just sets codeCXXcode to g even if it knows g doesnt really exist.p  pMy question is, how can you understand if codeACPROGCXXcode did actually find a proper compilerp  pI am asking because I have a C library in my project that could be optionally compiled. I cant seem to figure out how on earth Im supposed to know whether I can actually compile anything with codeCXXcode.p  hr  pSome of the macros like codeACPROGCCC99code give a variable in this case codeaccvprogccc99code that can tell me if the feature exists or not. I tried codeaccvprogcxxcode and similar things, but it doesnt seem to exist.p

Negative 2498 pemHopefully this question is not off topic, personally I feel like this is a perfectly valid programming question that I have as a programmer looking towards the future.em p  pGuys, Im failing to understand why I want to involve my websites with client side frameworks like Angular, Backbone, Ember, React, this, that or the other. p  pThe fact of the matter is why learn something like Angular when theyre pretty much pulling the rug out from under people and companies whove invested millions into Angular 1.0 in order to make a new framework which they will call angular 2.0 p  pIf I want some basic dom manipulation why learn a framework at all.  For instance, on the home page of my movies site a hrefhttpwww.noobmovies.com relnofollowwww.noobmovies.coma  youll notice some pagination, this is entirely done by grabbing JSON passed back from a Django Server View and using the client to parse the Data.  Say I need to update a movie etc... why not just pass some data via Ajax and send the response back  p  pThe bottom line is much of what AngularJS and the like does, aims to replace mature frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails etc... but why make life harder at the moment to jump on these buzzword projects that dont seem to do anything more than what these entrenched frameworks are more than capable of doing at the present  p  pTo me, Ive played with React, Angular and Backbone.  I dont like having to learn an entire framework to do something I may be better off doing myself.   It seems like all of these client side frameworks are not production ready to begin with, change way to frequently and make things harder than they need to be for many mundane tasks.  p  pTo me it just seems like everybody coming out of school is like, Dude, I have to build something with Angular to like keep up with the in crowd.  I see no reason why Angular projects are any better than Django or Ruby on Rails, in fact for the most part I see many cases of them being worse. p

Negative 2498 pWe currently have a MSSQL server with the data stored in a denormalized format in a single table per record type where there can be millions of rows containing many columns in some cases. The requirement of the application is to read the data for each record in the application i.e. each matching row must be sent and read by the application using a C DataReader approach, so no aggregations can be made in the SQL server since the actual data is needed.p  pThe querying are in most cases pretty simple on a Date field integer represented and on two or three text columns.p  pBased on the requirement do you guys think that SQL server a good fit or are there other data storages ex NoSQL solutions thst perhaps would be bettereasier to use.p  pSome of our systems contains hundreds of gigabytes of data in this format and its read only data once imported i.e. data is never updated.p  pThe bottleneck for us right now seems to be Disk IO performance when returning large results, and because of the size there are no way of having everything cached at all time.p  pAny tips on different storage solutions that we should look into.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2498 pSo this sort of goes with my question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1668248authenticationcookieAuthentication Cookieap  pOur current organization has a CAS SSO system. I manage multiple applications that all use their own sessions in ColdFusion. I could just use the SSO system to authenticate, but when a user logs out of one of my systems I want to make sure I log them out of ALL my systems, but I wont know which ones they are in necessarily. Trying to do this in a practical way. The good thing is all my applications are on the same subdomain. SO...p  pI set three cookies at the subdomain level with a 30 min expiration. p  ul liCookie A Contains the useridli liCookie B Contains a string with the expiration datetimeli liCookie C Contains a HASH of the two with some SALT added inli ul  pMy thinking is if the user tried to change the userid the HASH check would fail. If someone got on the machine and tried to change the expiration the HASH check would fail. Thus hopefully making this secure. And when someone logs out of my system I clear the cookie thats shared with all of them and if they return to any system they are forced to log in again. I verify the hash on each page load and refresh the cookie periodically to extend the expiration time.p  pEDIT Additionally, if user logs into app1 and then goes to app2, I dont use the cookie to authenticate, I send them back to the SSO and only if they are still logged into the SSO do they get in. So I only use the cookie to log them out AND make sure they are still logged in.  END EDITp  pApart from the fact that the userid is exposed in the cookie is this securewhere could this fail or be compromisedp  pI dont want to store sessions or anything like that in a DB if it can be avoided.p

Negative 2498 pI intend to write a program that simulates particles collisions in one or more dimension. For the 2D case, I would also like to make a GUI that shows the particles. p  pI have a main class, codeParticleCollidercode, which contains an inner class, codeParticlecode, an array of said codeParticlescodeas well as some methods for updating the positions and velocities of the particles. The class roughly looks like thisp  precodeclass ParticleCollider        class Particle            private double mass           private double[] pos           plus some other private class variables           public Particledouble mass, double[] pos                 this.mass  mass                 this.pos  pos                        private Particle[] pArray       Details of constructor are irrelevant      public ParticleCollider               Do stuff to particles in pArray, i.e. change their positions and velocitites      public void update            For example           pArray[0].pos[0]  0         codepre  pIn the graphics class, I want to be able to access the codeParticlescode so that I can find their positions and radii for drawing purposes. One way would of course be to add a method codegetParticlescodein codeParticleCollidercodeto return the array of codeParticlescode, codepArraycode. My question is now if this would be considered a violation of encapsulation. Because the codeParticlecodeclass has no setters, I cannot change the codeParticlescode. Also, because an array hase fixed length, I cannot add any codeParticlescode. The only thing I could do, which I guess is pretty bad, is take some codeParticlecodeand assign it the value of codenullcode. p  pstrongEDITstrong It has been suggested that I use a List instead of an array and provide an iterator to said List. It would seem to me that this would not solve the encapsulation problem. Regardless, Im relucant to abandon the array because I need to be able to select a random codeParticlecode in the collection of codeParticlescode and then iterate it cyclically.p

Negative 2498 pI have built flask apis in the past, but Ive never had the luxury of being on a project where I was allowed to do test driven development while working on one. Now I am.p  pEvery howto Ive ever read shows flaskapis being defined in a decidedly nonobjectoriented style. This makes writing unit tests very difficult because one cannot pass optional or testspecific parameters into the instantiated api.p  pFor example, this blog explains one method for creating unit tests for a flaskapi a hrefhttpmkelsey.com20130515testdrivendevelopmentofaflaskapi relnofollowhttpmkelsey.com20130515testdrivendevelopmentofaflaskapiap  pThe blog sets an environment variable when in test mode and the script watches for that variable, altering its behavior when it is found. This seems very inadvisable to me. There are a long list of reasons why letting your source code bleed into your OS environment is a Bad Idea. Im a big believer in encapsulating functionality in order to maximize portability and to draw clear distinctions between where modules begin and end.p  pIn order to satisfy my coding philosophy someone might suggest I just wrap the flask API up in a class. However, it isnt clear to me how one would do such a thing. For example, Flask uses decorators in order to define a routep  precodeapp.route codepre  pHow could this be fit into a classp  pI would greatly appreciate the guidance of anyone who has developed a flask api in an object oriented manner.p

Which was not the case or I werent looking deep enough...p  pDoes none exist and do I have to invent a new schema for the taskp  pOr does it just hide before my eyes in hours of searchp  pThanks in advance, experts of stackoverflow. p  p[Edit] Some further clarificationp  ul lipI know that Linux, Windows and OSX have got headers for all basic protocols, but I want to omit platform dependend code. It would be enough for the standard and most used parts Eth, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc., but why programming and building up much more dependencies to libraries which support more seldom used protocols, when you can use ONE machine readable format within you are able to have ALL protocols defined Its possible that this is just a great dream of mine...pli lipRules are not important, I need the basic structure and field definitions with an optional description what the field data is for. p  ul liThe goal is to be able to build a packet with the structure information without plausibility checks, which would pass a test regarding only the structure, and to parse a packet and present it to the user, similar to wiresharks packet frame output tree. [plausibility checks should later be possible though]li ulli lipYou could call it a protocol dictionary... and I just cannot believe that no one else has had this idea already, thats why Im asking this question p  ul liBut when theres no such dictionary, Ill eagerly create one, even when its not the main goal of my emlittle hobby projectem...li ulli lipProgramlanguage independence is important, not particularly for my project CQt, but for everyone else who is interested in such a dictionary.pli ul

Negative 2498 pstrongPython 2.7.9 Django 1.7 MySQL 5.6strongp  pI would like to populate a whole bunch of object instances belonging to multiple classes, stack them up into a single codecreatecodelike query, open a database connection, execute the query, then close. My main motivation is performance, but code compactness is also a plus.p  pThe functionality of codebulkcreatecode appears to be exactly what I want, but I am in violation of at least one of the caveats listed a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7refmodelsquerysetsdjango.db.models.query.QuerySet.bulkcreate relnofollowherea, i.e. p  blockquote   pIt does not work with manytomany relationships.p blockquote  pand p  blockquote   pIt does not work with child models in a multitable inheritance scenario.p blockquote  pThese limitations are also described in a hrefhttpdjango.readthedocs.orgen1.7.xmodulesdjangodbmodelsquery.html relnofollowthe source codea thusp  precode So this case is fun. When you bulk insert you dont get the primary  keys back if its an autoincrement, so you cant insert into the  child tables which references this. There are two workarounds, 1  this could be implemented if you didnt have an autoincrement pk,  and 2 you could do it by doing On normal inserts into the parent  tables to get the primary keys back, and then doing a single bulk  insert into the childmost table. Some databases might allow doing  this by using RETURNING clause for the insert query. Were punting  on these for now because they are relatively rare cases. codepre  pBut the error returned when I attempt it is the generic p  blockquote   pValueError Cant bulk create an inherited modelp blockquote  pMy models do not apparently contain any manytomany fields or foreign keys. It is not entirely clear to me what multitable inheritance scenarios they are referring to, so Im not sure if that is my problem. I was hoping I could slip by with my structure that looks like this but then I got the general error, so no dicep  precodechild class with OneToOneField                                       child class with OneToOneFieldgtconcrete parent class                                    child class with OneToOneField codepre  pAs far as the workarounds suggested in the source, 1 is not an option for me, and 2 does not look appealing because I assume it would entail sacrificing the gains in performance that Im going for.p  pAre there other workarounds that could simulate codebulkcreatecode while handling inheritance like this and not forgo the gains in performance Do I need to go back down to raw SQL I would not mind making a separate collection and executing a separate codeINSERTcodecodecreatecode for each child object type.p

Negative 2498 pI have the following scenario a table with up to 20000 entries and another table with corresponding custom fields.  I need to implement a query with a filter opportunity over all colums including the custom fields AND skip and take AND I need the total row count after filtering. With the help of dynamic sql I managed to implement a query which adds the custom fields as columns to the first table.  But I am really having troubles implementing a skip and take functionality which runs really fast AND also returns the total row count. As not all of our customers are running on SQL Server 2012, the best way would be to implement the take and skip via a where clause over the rownumber, but i think this also is the slowest alternative. I like the OFFSET and FETCH functionality for the 2012 case, but still getting the row count seems to slow down a lot.p  pthis is my query resulting from the dynamic sql, below the whole dynamic query, both with the two alternatives as commentsp  precodeWith tempTable AS   SELECT   1. ALTERNATIVE ,ROWNUMBER Over ORDER BY  Nachname, Vorname desc As  ROWNUMBER ,COUNT1 OVER  as TotalRows FROM      SELECT  [a]., [DFSF].[DatenfeldName],[DatenfeldInhalt]     FROM      [dbo].[Ansprechpartner] AS a left join [dbo].[Datenfeld] AS dfe     ON [a].[Id]  [dfe].[DatenfeldAnsprechpartnerID]     left join     [DatenfeldStandardfelder] AS DFSF      ON dfe.[StandardfeldID]  [DFSF].[id] and datenfeldkategorie  Ansprechpartner      AS j PIVOT    max[DatenfeldInhalt] FOR [j].[DatenfeldName]  IN [Medium],[Kontaktthema],[Mediengattung],[Medienthema],[EMail],[Homepage],[Rolle]  AS p  SELECT  2. ALTERNATIVE ,COUNT1 OVER  FROM tempTable  WHERE 11   1. ALTERNATIVE and RowNumber BETWEEN 0 AND 100 ORDER BY  Nachname, Vorname DESC 2. ALTERNATIVE OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS ONLY    codepre  pand following the whole dynamic query. I actually think, there is an error in it, because like this I wont get the correct row count, I would probably have to call it once again without the rownumber filter to get it right...p  precodeDECLARE filterExpression nvarcharMAX DECLARE showOnlyDoublets int DECLARE sortExpression nvarcharMAX  DECLARE skip AS int  DECLARE take AS [int]  SELECT skip  0  SELECT take  100 SELECT filterExpression  WHERE Vorname like luc SELECT filterExpression   WHERE 11 SELECT sortExpression  ORDER BY  Nachname, Vorname desc SELECT showOnlyDoublets  0  DECLARE idList nvarcharMAX select idList   COALESCEidList  ],[, [  [DFSF].[DatenfeldName] from [DatenfeldStandardfelder] AS DFSF  where datenfeldkategorie  Ansprechpartner  SELECT idList  idList ] SELECT idList  DECLARE sqlToRun nvarcharmax SET sqlToRun   With tempTable As   SELECT  , ROWNUMBER Over   sortExpression   As  RowNumber  FROM      SELECT  [a]., [DFSF].[DatenfeldName],[DatenfeldInhalt], CAST ROWNUMBER  OVERORDER BY [DFSF].[DatenfeldName] DESC AS varchar20      FROM      [dbo].[Ansprechpartner] AS a left join [dbo].[Datenfeld] AS dfe     ON [a].[Id]  [dfe].[DatenfeldAnsprechpartnerID]     left join     [DatenfeldStandardfelder] AS DFSF      ON dfe.[StandardfeldID]  [DFSF].[id] and datenfeldkategorie  Ansprechpartner    AS j PIVOT    max[DatenfeldInhalt] FOR [j].[DatenfeldName]  IN   idList    AS p  SELECT ,  COUNT OVER  as TotalRows FROM tempTable   filterExpression    AND RowNumber BETWEEN   CAST  skip AS varchar    AND   CAST  take AS varchar      sortExpression   OFFSET   CAST  skip AS varchar    ROWS FETCH NEXT   CAST  take AS varchar    ROWS ONLY     PRINT sqlToRun EXECUTE spexecutesql sqlToRun codepre  pSo my question is is there a way to improve this query one of the two alternatives Or do you have a totally different idea, because I think, either way, if I call the count correctly, it will cost a lot of time.p

Negative 2498 pSo after doing some exhaustive research tonight on this problem, Im still stumped. Im running Debian Wheezy and Im trying to get curl to support ssl, which it just plainly refuses to do. Ive tried to remove all traces of OpenSSL and Curl. Then use aptget install OpenSSL, which installs OpenSSL 1.0.1e. I then went and tried to compile curl from source, thinking maybe aptget was just being silly with installing curl. I tried to configure using this.p  precode.configure withssl LDFLAGSldl codepre  pbecause it would pass some errors other wise. Without LDFLAGS Ill get this in my log. a hrefhttppastebin.comdY2qkW99 relnofollowconfig.loga But as I said, with LDFLAGS on, Im able to actually create the config, but then when I go to make.. well.. thats when all heck seems to break loose and she wont install. p  precodeusrbinld usrlocalsslliblibcrypto.aecpnistz256.o relocation RX866432 against .rodata.str1.1 can not be used when making a shared object recompile with fPIC usrlocalsslliblibcrypto.a could not read symbols Bad value collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status make[2]  [libcurl.la] Error 1 make[2] Leaving directory homeopensslcurl7.27.0lib make[1]  [all] Error 2 make[1] Leaving directory homeopensslcurl7.27.0lib make  [allrecursive] Error 1 codepre  pAfter some research, some people suggested building OpenSSL with fPIC.

I then went to install Curl again and still ended up getting this error.. which was strange.. so now Im sitting here scratching my head. Ive uninstalled, reinstalled, recompiled and installed and done every mix of things I can think of and Im still pretty darn stumped.p  pSorry if my formatting is terrible tonight, its rather late for me.

Negative 2498 pWeve recently discovered a serious bug in our software that was caused by assuming that a dynamically allocated array was initialized to zero while it wasnt. So the problem was something like thisp  precodeint foo  new int[1] foo[0]  10 codepre  pIm now trying to estimate the impact of this since we also recently had a few changes in our environment We started using new processing units which run a different OS Win XP before, which are still used, now in addition to that some new units running Win 8.p  pThere appears to be no problem with the computations running on the Win XP machines, but on Win 8 the same binaries produce gibberish. So the compiler does not initialize these arrays these were optimized builds but it seems like Windows XP does initialize newly allocated memory to zeros while Windows 8 does not. Is this somewhere documented Can I trust in this so that I can assume this problem did not affect all computations previously executed on the Win XP machinesp

Negative 2498 pI have a serious problem with my server. Sometimes often at the night, we have an attack on my HTTP Port 80 and I checked with netstat commands with a lot of switches and features and the only one thing I can understand from these netstat commands is  There are a lot of TCP Connection on 80 Port with no IP  Unfortunately there are a lot of load on my Server Loads. And when we are restarted the web server all of those connection will be lost and no loads continued on the server and there is no more load on the server until the attack will start. For example you can watch the result after restarting webserver apache about 2 minutes after attack p  p[roothostedby ] netstat ntu  awk print 5  cut d f1  sort  uniq c  sort nrp  precode  9    7 155.121.25.38    1 servers    1 Address    1 95.85.112.209 codepre  pThe one thing that makes me amazing is  with number of 100 to 150 TCP Connections on port 80,the loads for my server a server with 4 GB of RAM and 4 Core Xeon cpu will grew up to 110  p  pI tried to trace the issue with tcpdump sniffer and I couldnt find any result from tcpdump.

Negative 2498 pI created a keypad app that stays on top, but does not take the focus so that on a touch screen it will forward whatever keys you press to the active application via SendKeys.p  pIt works perfectly with every application I have tried it with... except, of course, for the one I actually need it to work with which is a Point Of Sale application. The POS application lets the user type in item codes on the keyboard but it doesnt have a good keypad for touchscreens so thats why Im trying to create an external one for it since I dont have access to the POS application code.p  pIt actually does work when you first try it, but then its pretty sporadic. Using the keyboard directly always works, so Im not sure why SendKeys only works sometimes with this application. Ive tried implementing it several ways... sending the keys as they are pressed, sending them altogether when the user presses the enter button on the keypad, copying the keys to the clipboard and then using send keys to do a CtlV and then Enter.p  pWhat other options do I have to simulate a key press to another application SendKeys doesnt seem to perfectly simulate key presses, so is there a lower level mechanism I can tap intop  pI should mention that when it doesnt work, what happens is that I get a beep from the POS application as though Id pressed an invalid key. So its not that it isnt getting some kind of input but clearly it isnt getting the key Im sending it the same way it would from an actual keyboard.p

Negative 2498 pI am new to install4j and am trying to change the file permission of a directory to 0750 on a project that I inherited. I am in the Define Distribution Tree screen, right click on the directory, select Edit Entry, and change the Unix mode to 750. I save the project. After running the new install running as root, the file permission is set to 755 default. Are there additional steps required I looked for other spots where the file permission may have been explicitly set, but did not find any. Any ideas on what I did wrong and how to debug this Thanks.p

Negative 2498 pToday I came across some strange and very inconvenient Ruby on Rails behavior that even persistent combing of the net did not yield a satisfying answer to.

Doing this in routes.rb does indeed solve my problemp  precodepatch assignmentsid gt assignmentsupdate, as assignment codepre  pHowever, even when defining it as POST, Rails should not direct a POST request to the existing path assignmentstakeoverconfirmation to a completely different action, should it I fear the next time I use two POST routes for the same controller it will do the same thing again.p  pIt seems I have a severe misconception of Rails routing, but cannot lay my finger on it...p  h1Edit Solutionh1  pAs katafrakt explained, the above request to codeassignmentstakeoverconfirmationcode matched the route codeassignmentsidcode because Rails interpreted the takeoverconfirmation part as string and used it for the id parameter. Thus, this is perfectly expected behavior.p  h2Working Exampleh2  pFor the sake of completeness, here is a working if minimalistic routedefinition that does as it should, inspired by Chriss commentp  precode  resources assignments do     collection do       post takeoverconfirmation     end   end codepre  pIn this example, only my manually created route is explicitly defined.

Negative 2498 pIm trying to workout a problem in C regarding inheritance and wondering how to go about doing it correctly. p  pI have 3 classes set up   Enemy which has member data int Damage, int Health and int Level   Wolf   Bearp  pThe way my inheritance is set up is Wolf isa Enemy and Bear isa Enemy.

Negative 2498 pIm fairly new to Javascript promises, and running into an issue that I cant hunt down anything about via Google or Stack Exchange. When I refer to a function in a .then chained off a promise, I sometimes have to wrap that function in an anonymous function in order to stop it from automatically executing before the original promise is resolved. For example, if my code isp  precodefunction deleteAdvertiseradvertiser      dialogService.Confirmnull, Delete         .thenadvertiserService.deleteAdvertiseradvertiser         .thengetAdvertisers  codepre  pthe call to advertiserService.deleteAdvertiser will automatically fire before I resolve the promise from the dialogService.Confirm.

Ive verified that this promise is returning correctly. My best guess as to why this is happening is that my need to pass along an advertiser object from the UI the function is initially called via an ngclick on a trash can button means that I have to call advertiserService.deleteAdvertiseradvertiser that is to say, with an argument passed in which in turn means that JS is executing that function call as soon as it reads it, rather than just storing the reference to use later when the initial promise is resolved.p  pAm I correct in my understanding of why the first code block doesnt work Why does wrapping it in an anonymous function make the difference And is there a correct or at least better way to chain these promisesp  pThank youp

Negative 2498 pI like VIM a lot because it kind of doubles the power of my keyboard in a way. Its either in insert or motion or whatever they call it mode. Navigating through source code, typing code, while being able to keep my hands in the touch type position is great. But when a dialog box is opened eg. the one using ctrlF12, if I have to select something other than the first one in the list, I am forced to have to move my right hand to the cursor keys. Is there a way so that I can use J and K or else something with ctrl or alt or something, so that I can select an item while keeping my hands in the touch typing positionp

Negative 2498 pIm trying to implement WebRTC on an android device supporting API 22 and Im trying to connect to Kurento Media Server to establish media server capabilities.

Negative 2498 pIm loading in the content of a modal with ajax.

Negative 2498 pI downloaded and installed the lintian ARM toolchain and I can get a successful little endian compile and link.  I can use the mbigendian argument and I get through the compile phases, but then fail in the link phase.  I assume this is because the libraries were NOT built as big endian.  Am I wrong  Are bigendian libraries available  If I have to build the libraries myself, whats the easiest way for me to get that donep

Negative 2498 pI ask this question because Im getting a compilation error in my solution GiftCard is a namespace but is used like a typep  pI tried adding a using directive like using GiftCard.Data.Entityp  pwhich is the correct namespace where GiftCard is found, but the error does not go away. When I add the fully qualified name in my code, i.e. GiftCard.Data.Entity.GiftCardp  p...then the error goes away, and code compiles.p  pBut Im wondering why the using directive does not work. I dont want to clutter my code with the fully qualified name every time I need to use the type. Somehow the error message is saying that I have GiftCard defined as a namespace somewhere. So how can I find all the namespaces in my solution so that I know where it is defined because I need to either remove or rename the GiftCard namespace.p
