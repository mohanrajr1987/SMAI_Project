Positive 1378 pI have a list of items. I use pagination here to show 10 itemspage which works fine. However, when I check this item, I change the checked value in the database from false to true. When an items status is true it shouldnt be shown on the list anymore. Changing this value is also working fine, but my problem is with the pagination. It updates by removing the item from the list, which is good, but now theres no longer 10 items on the first page, but 9. This goes on all the way until the first page is empty, and I have to switch to page 2 to continue checking items, which is obviously not good.

Positive 1378 pIm using angulars ngrepeat to present very large amounts of information.

Positive 1378 pFrom the API docs dynamo db does support pagination for scan and query operations. The catch here is to set the codeExclusiveStartIndexcode of current request to the value of the codeLastEvaluatedIndexcode of previous request to get next set logical page of results.p  pIm trying to implement the same but Im using codeDynamoDBMappercode, which seems to have lot more advantages like tight coupling with data models.

Positive 1378 pIm developing an adminstration interface for a set of tables. I need to implement functionalities such as listing, sorting, filtering and pagination.p  pIm using Spring Boot as a starter and Spring Data Jpa for repository. Ive searched the Web for some examples about a complete solution that includes all the above functionalities. What I found included almost all of them, but appearently if there was pagination and sorting there wasnt filtering or viceversa.p  pNow Im storing the filter in a application object on session using codeModelAttributecode but I know that is now a good design because the applciation will extend and it becomes hard to maintain. Im also using codePagecode and codePaginationcode for pagination purpose and using codeSpecificationscode for filtering.p  pWhat I want is to submit all the data, i.e. search fields, sorted fields and current page, in a single request.

Negative 1378 pIn a Linuxbased system specifically, Ubuntu Server 8.04, how can you measure downstream bandwidth on a peruser basis  Optimally, I would like a method that provides data directly instead of having to run another process and parse its output.  I have a technique for measuring peruser upstream bandwidth by setting up one iptables filter per user and checking their counters at regular intervals, but this doesnt seem to be supported for downstream connections, which I assume is because iptables checks packets before they are routed to a process.p  pcode[edit 20080916 153434 EST]code By peruser, I mean literal accounts on the system.  That is, any account with a real POSIX UID owning actual running processes.  So, for Ubuntu Server 8.04, measurements would include values for coderootcode, codewwwdatacode, my own account, etc.p

Negative 1378 pI really dont understand the fascination with XHTML strict.  Inline JavaScript typically requires a rats nest of escapes to make it compatible with XHTML and semibackwards compatible with MSIE 5 amp 6.   Then there is the issue of not being OCD enough on user input to make sure you dont miss any illegal characters.  It just seems like more effort then its worth.   Nevermind that almost every developer Ive worked along side of keeps forgetting to ensure the contenttype returned from the server is reset for XHTML pages from texthtml to applicationxhtmlxml.p  pWish I knew the name of the blogger, but someone else pointed out that a majority of supposedly XHTML compliant websites and open source packages are actually not because of that last issue, forgetting to set the contenttype header correctly.p  pIm looking to understand why XHTML is useful, or build enough of an arsenal of arguments to prevent it ever being used in future projects that I have influence on.p

Negative 1378 pI am wanting to try to tie the CryptUnprotectData windows API function and the .net SecureString together the best way possible.  CryptUnprotectData returns a DATABLOB structure consisting of an array of bytes and a byte length.  In my program this will be a Unicode UTF16 string.  SecureString has a constructor which takes a char and length params, so I would like to be able to do something likep  preSecureString ss  SecureStringchartextBlob.pbData, textBlob.cbData  2pre  pThis works, except UTF16 is variable length, so I dont really know what to use as the length argument.

What is the best way to do this without copying the values around in memory thereby compromising security.  I plan on zeroing out and freeing the byte array as quickly as possible.p

Negative 1378 pI am currently in a job where we practice serious pair programming on windows machines. We both have a set of keyboards, mice, and we have two monitors, which works well for switching whos the driver really easy, but there are some points in the session that I would like to start writing tests at the same time that my pair is writing implementation. p  pI am wondering if there is any program that would allow me to have effectively two cursors and keyboard focuses on the same computer. If they dont exist then I am willing to experiment with my own solution, but I would like input as to how to best accomplish this. I am most familiar with .Net 3.5 technologies, but I also know Java and am willing to learn C to solve this problem.p  pIf I was creating the solution myself I would go down the road of being able to grab the input of one hardware device i.e. a specific mouse thats installed and prevent Windows from moving the pointer, and instead move my own programs pointer independently.p

Shall i use some helper Methodes to distinguish if a Object of a class is already initialized a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1589144isthereahelpertoknowwhetherapropertyhasbeenloadedbyhibernate4a or should i apdicate the use of equals and use helper classes instead a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1929445toequalsandhashcodeornotonentityclassesthatisthequestion2a And what is about catching LazyInitializationExceptions in the equalsp  hr  p[Edit] If you put equals in context with the initialization of the Object then it will gain importance. Sometimes it is nessesary to have the Object fully initialized but sometimes you dont want to. Because you just need the Object itself name, id, ... not its CollectionProperties. So just for equalization you have to reattach the Object and load the whole bunch you dont realy need Are there any other solutions for such a problemp

Negative 1378 pIm using SQLite3 in a Windows application. I have the source code socalled SQLite amalgamation.p  pSometimes I have to execute heavy queries. That is, I call codesqlite3stepcode on a prepared statement, and it takes a lot of time to complete due to the heavy IO load.p  pI wonder if theres a possibility to abort such a call. I would also be glad if there was an ability to do some background processing in the middle of the call strongwithin the same threadstrong since most of the time is spent in waiting for the IO to complete.p  pI thought about modifying the SQLite code myself. In the simplest scenario I could check some condition like an abort event handle for instance before every invocation of either codeReadFilecodecodeWriteFilecode, and return an error code appropriately. And in order to allow the background processing the file should be opened in the overlapped mode this enables asynchronous codeReadFilecodecodeWriteFilecode.p  pIs there a chance that interruption of codeWriteFilecode may in some circumstances leave the database in the inconsistent state, even with the journal enabled I guess not, since the whole idea of the journal file is to be prepared for any error of any kind. But Id like to hear more opinions about this.p  pAlso, did someone tried something similarp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks to ereOn. I wasnt aware of the existence of codesqlite3interruptcode. This probably answers my question.p  pNow, for all of you who wonders how and why one expects to do some background processing during the IO within the same thread.p  pUnfortunately not many people are familiar with socalled Overlapped IO.p  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOverlappedIO relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOverlappedIOap  pUsing it one issues an IO operation strongasynchronouslystrong, and the calling thread is strongnot blockedstrong. Then one receives the IO completion status using one of the completion mechanisms waitable event, new routine queued into the APC, or the completion port.p  pUsing this technique one doesnt have to create extra threads. Actually the only strongrealstrong legitimation for creating threads is when your bottleneck is the computation time i.e. CPU load, and the machine has several CPUs or cores.p  pAnd creating a thread just to let it be blocked by the OS most of the time  this doesnt make sense. This leads to the unjustified waste of the OS resources, complicates the program need for synchronization and etc..p  pUnfortunately not all the librariesAPIs allow asynchronous mode of operation, thus making creating extra threads the necessarily evil.p  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pIve already found the solution, thansk to ereOn.p  pFor all those who nevertheless insist that its not worth doing things in background while waiting for the IO to complete using overlapped IO. I disagree, and I think theres no point to argue about this. At least this is not related to the subject.p  pIm a Windows programmer as you may noticed, and I have a very extensive experience in all kinds of multitasking. Plus Im also a driver writer, so that I also know how things work behind the scenes.p  pI know that its a common practice to create several threads to do several things in parallel. But this doesnt mean that this is a good practice. Please allow me not to follow the common practice.p

So we can easily get the correctly localized label to apply to runtime fault messagesli ol  pThe general concept is that this simplifies presenting consistent messages to the user while only creating things once.  With regards to validation attributes and this question, we need to be able to get the Resource file type to load the correct message.  p

Negative 1378 pIm getting ready to start a small project that provides an opportunity to use single table inheritance.  As I read through prior post on STI on Stackoverflow there seems to be some strong opinions on sides of the argument.  p  pMy application is related to my horse racing hobby.

Negative 1378 pWe are migrating a struts application over to Spring MVC and utilizing the Controller annotation to direct pages to various method calls.p  pIm having trouble determining a good strategy for reuse though.p  pWe basically do the same things in many of our pagesp  precodeprepareView..., ...

Various params  could likely be standardized codepre  pWhat strategies are used for creating a final method which will allow the developers to forget about these processes  Id thought about making an abstract class, but there really isnt a way Im seeing to standardize this due to differences in what each method will take.p  pFor instance we have the followingp  precodeRequestMappingparamsassign, methodRequestMethod.Post public ModelAndView assignSessionAttributevaluesessionAttr Pojo pojo,                            ModelAttributecommand CommandPojo commandPojo,                            BindingResult result      Follows pattern above   RequestMapping public ModelAndView filterResultsSessionAttributevaluesessionAttr Pojo pojo,                                   RequestAttributerequestAttr String requestAttr,                                   ModelAttributecommand CommandPojo2 commandPojo2,                                   BindingResult result       Follows pattern above  codepre  pHaving a final method would require this to be broken into two POJOs which would then call the descriptive functions.

Negative 1378 pIve begun to notice something of an antipattern in my ASP.NET development.  It bothers me because it feels like the right thing to do to maintain good design, but at the same time it smells wrong.p  pThe problem is this  we have a multilayered application, the bottom layer is a class handling calls to a service that provides us with data.  Above that is a layer of classes that possible transform, manipulate, and check the data.  Above that are the ASP.NET pages.p  pIn many cases, the methods from the the service layer dont need any changes before going on the view, so the model is just a straight pass through, likep  precodepublic ListltIDatagt GetDataint id, string filter, bool check      return DataService.GetDataid, filter, check  codepre  pIts not wrong, nor necessarily awful to work on, but it creates an odd kind of copypaste dependency.  Im also working on the underlying service, and it also replicates this patter a lot, and there are interfaces throughout.  So what happens is, I need to add codeint someotherIDcode to codeGetDatacode  So I add it to the model, the service caller, the service itself, and the interfaces.   It doesnt help that codeGetDatacode is actually representative of several methods that all use the same signature but return different information.  The interfaces help a bit with that repetition, but it still crops up here and there.p  pIs there a name for this antipattern  Is there a fix, or is a major change to the architecture the only real way  It sounds like I need to flatten my object model, but sometimes the data layer is doing transformations so it has value. I also like keeping my code separated between calls an outside service and supplies page data.p
Negative 1378 pFirst I realize that this issue should be quite simple and lots of people seem to have experienced it. However, it appears my issue may be emslightlyem different from existing posts.p  pIm using NetBeans to compile a Java application. When its done building, the output goes into the dist folder correctly. The jar file is present there. If I go to the command line, navigate to that folder, and call the followingp  pjava jar Prosperity.jarp  peverything works fine. Obviously the name of the application is Prosperity. The following command also works finep  pjavaw jar Prosperity.jarp  pHowever, doubleclicking the .jar file gives the message Could not find the main class, and then gives the path to the .jar file. Ive checked a hundred times that the METAINF folder exists inside the .jar file, and that within it there exists a MANIFEST.MF with the correct main class name. I have also checked that the main class App.class .class file exists inside the .jar file.p  pSo the question is whats the difference between doubleclicking a file and running javaw on it Its getting really frustrating that it wont just runp  pThanks for any direction you can give me, Im tearin my hair out herep

Negative 1378 pMy particular problem is something like thisp  ul lipWe are currently running a set of services which requires the clients to provide a username and password as authentication when calling the services. pli lipWe would like to implement a PKIinfrastructure on these services, but some of our partners will use longer time to accomodate to this new infrastructure than the others.pli lipAs a first step we want to require client certificates from some of our partners. A client certificate will be required in addition to username and password to access their data on our servers, while for the other users only username and password will be required.pli ul  pTo solve this problem I am trying to implement a custom validator for both the usernamepassword authentication using UserNamePasswordValidator and for the client certificates using X509CertificateValidator in WCF. The usernamepassword validator will verify these credentials towards our database, while the client certificate validator will inspect whether the request is from a client from which we require a certificate, and if so verify that a valid client certificate is provided. I have not been able to configure WCF so that it uses both of these validators.p  pMy WCF configuration on the server is currently set up like thisp    pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltbehaviorsgt   ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehavior nameMyServiceBehaviorgt       ltserviceMetadata httpsGetEnabledtrue policyVersionPolicy15 gt       ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultstrue gt       ltserviceCredentialsgt         ltclientCertificategt           ltauthentication customCertificateValidatorTypeMyWS.Security.MyServicesCertificateValidator, MyWS             certificateValidationModeCustom revocationModeNoCheck gt         ltclientCertificategt         ltuserNameAuthentication userNamePasswordValidationModeCustom           customUserNamePasswordValidatorTypeMyWS.Security.MyServicesUsernameValidator, MyWS gt       ltserviceCredentialsgt     ltbehaviorgt   ltserviceBehaviorsgt ltbehaviorsgt ltserviceHostingEnvironment multipleSiteBindingsEnabledtruegt ltbindingsgt   ltbasicHttpBindinggt     ltbinding nameMySoapBindinggt       ltsecurity modeTransportWithMessageCredentialgt         lttransport clientCredentialTypeCertificate gt         ltmessage clientCredentialTypeUserName gt       ltsecuritygt     ltbindinggt   ltbasicHttpBindinggt ltbindingsgt ltservicesgt   ltservice behaviorConfigurationMyServiceBehavior nameMyWS.Services.TheServicegt     ltendpoint address bindingbasicHttpBinding bindingConfigurationMySoapBinding nameTheService bindingNamespacehttpsservices.myTheService contractMyWS.Interfaces.Service.ITheService gt     lthostgt       ltbaseAddressesgt         ltadd baseAddresshttpslocalhost4434MyWSTheServicegt       ltbaseAddressesgt     lthostgt   ltservicegt ltservicesgt codepre  pAs far as I understand this configuration is invalid because I cant use the customCertificateValidatorType at the transport layer because IIS inspects the certificate before WCF is involved here, but I can not see how I am able to combine both the customCertificateValidatorType and customUserNamePasswordValidatorType as credential types at the message layer either. p  pI have implemented a message inspector and might be able to solve the problem using the OperationContext in some way as suggested in the link below, but I have not been able to see a way for me to do it this way yet...p  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenwcfthreadb6ab8b58516b41d4bb0e75b4baf92716httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenwcfthreadb6ab8b58516b41d4bb0e75b4baf92716ap  pI suppose I might be trying to implement something that is incompatible with the way WCF works, but if someone have an idea about how this could be fixed I would be delighted to have your feedback on thisp

Negative 1378 pMorningEvening all,p  pIve got a problem where Im making a script for work that uses ClamAV to scan for malware, and then place its results in MySQL by taking the resultant ClamAV logs using grep with awk to convert the right parts of the log to a variable. The problem I have is that whilst I have done the summary ok, the syntax of detections makes it slightly more difficult. Im no expert at regex by all means and this is a bit of a learning experience, so there is probably a far better way of doing it than I havep  pThe lines Im trying to parse looks like thesep  precodenetnasvol0homerecepSG4rt.exe Worm.SomeFool.P FOUND netnasvol0homerecepSG4rt.exe moved to srvclamavquarantineSG4rt.exe codepre  pAs far as I was able to establish, I need a positive lookbehind to match what happens after and before the colon, without actually matching the colon or the space after it, and I cant see a clear way of doing it from RegExr without it thinking Im trying to look for two colons. To make matters worse, we sometimes get these too...p  precodeWARNING Cant open file netnasvol0homelasersamplessample1.avi Permission denied codepre  pThe end result is that I can build a MySQL query that inserts the path, malware found and where it was moved to or if there was an error then the path, then the error encountered so as to convert each element to a variable contents in a while statement.p  pIve done the scan summary as followsp  pSummary looks likep  precode SCAN SUMMARY  Known viruses 329 Engine version 0.97.1 Scanned directories 17350 Scanned files 50342 Infected files 3 Total errors 1 Data scanned 15551.73 MB Data read 16382.67 MB ratio 0.951 Time 3765.236 sec 62 m 45 s codepre  pParsing like thisp  precodeSCANNEDDIRScat srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log  grep Scanned directories  awk gsubScanned directories , print SCANNEDFILEScat srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log  grep Scanned files  awk gsubScanned files , print INFECTEDcat srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log  grep Infected files  awk gsubInfected files , print DATASCANNEDcat srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log  grep Data scanned  awk gsubData scanned , print DATAREADcat srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log  grep Data read  awk gsubData read , print TIMETAKENcat srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log  grep Time  awk gsubTime , print ENDTIMEdate s mysql u scannerparser passwordremoved sclive e INSERT INTO bs.live.bsjobstat VALUES NULL, CURRTIME, PID, IY, SCANNEDDIRS, SCANNEDFILES, INFECTED, DATASCANNED, DATAREAD, TIMETAKEN, ENDTIME rm f srvclamavIYscanLOGTIME.log codepre  pSome of those variables are from other parts of the script and can be ignored.

Negative 1378 pOkay Im just about ready to tear my hair out. Im loading a jqGrid with JSON data but with loadonce set to true, to keep it local. When I just show the default content of columns sorting works fine, but what I need is, for some columns to use info from another column to modify what is shown. For example, instead of having a device and a model column, I want to show both under one column, like this device  model, and I use a custom formatter for that.p  pThe problem is, in this case, when I do sort, I lose the model information and it becomes undefined. Heres part of my codep  precodemdlTable  tableWrap.jqGrid     url loadURL,     datatype json,     colNames [ID, Device, Description, IP, Model],     colModel [         nameid, indexid, hiddentrue, keytrue,         namedevice, indexdevice, width192,             formatterfunctionvalue, options, rData                 var str  lta hrefadministrationmdlvwDevice.aspxdeviceid                 str  rData[0]   targetblankgt  value                 if   rData[4] str      rData[4]                 str  ltagt                 return str                      ,         namedesc, indexdesc, width256, sortablefalse,         nameip, indexip, width96,         namemodel, indexmodel, hiddentrue     ],     sortname id,     viewrecords true,     loadonce true,     viewsortcols [true,vertical,true],     gridview true,     ignoreCase true  .navGriddeviceListfooter, editfalse, addfalse, delfalse, cloneToToptrue codepre  pSo as you can see, I hide the model column, and move that information over to the device column because thats where its suppose to be shown. Its all fine on load, but as soon as I do sort, or search and it refreshes the view as it were, the copy of the data is lost for some reason. If I show the model column the info there remains just fine, its just the device column that gets the undefined value.p  pI tried triggering reloadGrid, doesnt help. I also tried to add unformat function but Im not sure what I can do there. I basically just returned a cellobject.html  that didnt work obviously.p  pEdit Added sample JSON datap  precode rows  [         id  181,         cell  [181, Router A, some description, 55.444.33.222, Model 1]     ,          id  291,         cell  [291, Router B, some description, 55.333.22.444, Model 2]     ,          id  1346,         cell  [1346, Router C, some description, 55.111.44.333, Model 3]     ,          id  1999,         cell  [1999, Router D, some description, 55.222.11.000, Model 4]      ] codepre

I also suspect that the Aspect stuff is covered too, although I am still thinking about this.p  pThe Duck Typing is the thing that is getting me at the moment, so used to defining interfaces then basing classes on these interfaces and letting the static stuff cover my stupidity that I feel that without static typing, containers are a bit useless.p  pstrongeditstrongp  pI think I wont be using Dependency Injector frameworkscontainers when using python. There really isnt any point. After thinking and reading the responses so far, the argument is made clear that without static type definitions the promises made are so loose that why bother at all. Duck typing is what it is, and the only promise can be made through documentation. As long as the reference comes into the class Method  function through a signiture parameter, and not coming through the ether of the programming environment, then I think I will be safe.p  pAlarming though is the fact that I can not enforce my will on others through my over bearing design practices as I have done in Java and C. Do I care......nah   p

Negative 1378 pi learned a lot about session start from my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6913426jqueryprogressbarloadsallatonce69135316913531previous questiona. Now im wondering how session locking occurs when files are included in other files. Lets say i havep  ppage.phpp  precodeincludeheader.php ...some html content.... includesubpage.php ...more html.... codepre  pheader.phpp  precodesessionstart ..save session vars... ..print web page header... codepre  psubpage.phpp  precodesessionstart ...use session vars.... ..print page content... codepre  pWhen i open page.php, does the session become unlocked as soon as header.php is done or is it live for the whole page.php life, so subpages session is blocked Is the codesessionstartcode in subpage necessary Would it be better practice if I codesessionwriteclosecode every time im done with session data Though that would mean codesessionstartcodeing everytime id like to use a session variable.p

Negative 1378 pOn one of my pages Im showing about 60 items I would like to be likeable via facebook. The problem is that I can not use several pages to show the items since this would reduce the usability of the page. But when loading  showing 60 like buttons is just too much for my browser. The page is not usable anymore because even scrolling takes several seconds because of the impact of showing 60 likte buttons.p  pDoes anybody know of an alternative way of using the like button Would it be possible to build a custom like button which loads the like count from my local database and somehow triggers the facebook like mechanism when the user clicks on my own like button This could be done by building a custom like button which on click loads the real like button, hides it and automatically triggers the click on the real like button Would this even be allowed or is forbidden by the facebook guidelines If that is the case, is there any other wayp  pBest regards, Danielp

Negative 1378 pIm using an Android device to get the headingazimuth, or yaw angle. p  pAndroid API used the Accelerometer value  the mganetic field to compute a matrix rotation, the azimuth is then extracted form that matrix aka SensorManager.getOrientation...

Negative 1378 pI am building an App for Android and iPhone. This app needs to receive notification for new messages in users inbox. Being a total noob in app dev, I was wondering if any of you guys could suggest the best way to implement what I need here.p  pI have read up more on Android than iPhone so my understanding of latter may be wanting. Based on what I have read and understood, I believe that I will need to start a service when my app launches for the first time or instruct the device to start the service every time the device starts or something. This service will then interface with a server to receive notifications and display them. Clicking on the notification will launch the app.p  pMy options are p  ol lipC2DM or APNSpli lipUrban Airshippli lipMy own server using mostly idle TCP connection with client.pli ol  pDepending upon the option I choose, my client side implementation as well as server side implementation changes.p  pWhat will you guys recommend Is there any other way to do what I need donep  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBuilding on jbat100 answer. The fact that Apple does not allow me to write my own server to communicate directly with my app for notifications means that APNS must be used. So option 3 is out altogether. This means we are left with either Urban Airship or interfacing directly with APNS and C2DM. Based on my research, the effort involved in both cases is comparable so it does not make sense to shell out 45K mo extra just to support notification. So I plan to implement option 1. If any of you think otherwise, please leave comments below.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1378 pI keep having troubles with my NSTimers and background selectors. It is driving me nuts and takes a very long time to try out each tweak. To preserve my sanity, and the sanity of future generations of cocoa programmers, Im asking this questionp  pIs there an absolutely 100 sure way to have a scheduled, longterm timer fire at a later point in time, regardless of whether it was called from a background thread, main thread, etcp  pIt seems that I keep having to solve the same problem over and over again for the majority of my classes that use NSTimers. they work during shortterm testing, lets say I set the timer to fire through a background thread to fire in 10 seconds. It works, because theres still a run loop running. But once I change the fire time to what I really want, like 1530 minutes, theres dead silence. The run loop is gone and I dont know how to handle such a case. Nothing happens, and I discover such bugs a few days later, once Ive already forgotten which timer would be responsible for that. p  pCurrently Im doing some really, really ugly dance with selectors, for example heres a test methodIt seems to work for 10 minute timersp  precodethis is a test method to simulate a background task requesting a timer   [self performSelectorInBackgroundselectorbackgroundReminderLongTermTest withObjectnil]  this is a method similar to the one that the background thread would be trying to invoke     voidbackgroundReminderLongTermTestidsender              [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorbackgroundReminderFromMainThread withObjectnil waitUntilDoneNO]       this is a wrapper for the background method, I want the timer to be added to a thread with a run loop already established and running     voidbackgroundReminderFromMainThreadidsender                  [playTimers addObject[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval1800 targetself selectorselectorstart userInfonil repeatsNO]]       codepre  pI like the convenience of not having to worry about creating a fire date object with the scheduled timers, but should I just forget about them and use timers with specific fire dates It seems that the scheduledTimer works well for short term tasks, when the run loop is already present, but I simply cannot see this kind of bugs during the apps execution. At one point, it seems that the timers are firing normally, but at a later point they stop firing completely.p  pThank you for any help or clarification. strongIm looking for a method that schedules timers without having to worry about whether or not a run loop is present every time I need to schedule a timer.

That is, the same encapsulated Component for one GridView, but elsewhere in the application it might use a different Component.p  pSo, what I would like to do is have each invocation supply a delegate that is added to each element in the GridView, which is already a delegate.  In other words, something like thisp  pstrongMyGrid.qmlstrongp  precodeimport QtQuick 1.1  Rectangle    id myGrid   objectName myGrid    property Component internalDelegate   property variant internalModel    GridView      anchors.fill parent      delegate Row        Loader          sourceComponent myGrid.internalDelegate                  model parent.internalModel     codepre  pThe idea is that the Loader inside the GridView delegate loads the usersupplied delegate, which would look something like thisp  pstrongMain.qmlstrongp  precodeimport QtQuick 1.1  Rectangle    anchors.fill parent    width 300   height 200    MyGrid      anchors.fill parent      internalDelegate Text        text name           internalModel ListModel        ListElement          name a               ListElement          name b                 codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work.  QML reports that name is an unknown variable inside the Text element.  If I replace the name variable with a string i.e. hello, it works as expected.p  pMy question is, how can I pass the name variable to internalDelegate, or better yet, make the entire Model available so internalDelegate can access all of them since the caller is defining the model as well.p  pA side question is Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 1378 pIve got a Picturebox, which the user can drag up or down. The PictureBox represents a note on a piano staff. When the note is moved up or down, the notes position is to change relative to the staff lines. Hence, the positions can ONLY be moved to fixed positions Yvalues. Thus, when the user moves a note vertically, it is not supposed to be placed anywhere, but only in specified positions dictated by the if statements.p  pThe issue is that the user is able to move the PictureBox music note component down, but when the object is dragged up, nothing happens. The class inherits from PictureBox.p  pI would just like to emphasise that the PictureBox works when dragged downwards, but does not move when dragged upwards. The dragging is done in intervals, i.e. the PictureBox can only be placed in certain places hence the need for specific coordinates.p

Negative 1378 pMore of a best practice question than a technical one, however Im trying to figure out the best way of organizing node  express apps to be the most optimized for scaling. Currently we have a single express js application that houses multiple parts of a site. This includes areas like chat, our BoxNet api, and a few others.p  pWould it be better to separate these areas into their own express applications to scale each one individually, or would it be better just to keep them all in one single express application Talking amongst the different parts of the application is nonexistent as its not really necessary. To me, the best reason for separating these applications would be to easily scale one of the different areas without having to scale the parts that arent being hit as much. The negative effects I see of this would be a potential management nightmare or multiple connections to a database per application  scale. Thoughts p  pThanks,p  pAricp

Negative 1378 pA lot has been written about not relying on client validation only its just a convenience for the user and reduces server processing. THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT.p  pI dont know if this is specific to ASP.NET MVC or all JQuery validation, but this is where my question comes from. When you use the ReqularExpressionAttribute with clientsidevalidation enabled, the HTML outputs with something like datavalregexpattern[09azAZ]3,12 just to throw a basic example.p  pIsnt this rather insecure, giving away explicitly what your expression is checking for and isnt checking for It seems like its much easier to exploit holes in a validation scheme when a user can easily read exactly what it is. And its the same expression that the server uses, so they can see what the server checks for too.p  pbUPDATEbp  pMy example expression isnt very good for describing the problem. Its about more complex data values that have very strict formats and you unintentionally overlook some loopholesp

Negative 1378 pthe main question is a bit short so Ill collaborate.  Im building an app for twitter with which you can do the basic actions get posts, do a post, reply etc.p  pNow I figured it would be a good idea if Id check the max 140 char limit in my app. So far so good, then someone asked if I could also do the urlshortener thing. p  pso at the moment I have a regex that picks op most in fact too much urls, takes the lenght of them and either adds or deduces the difference from the 140 max.  Its still a but buggy but I can manage that. p  pNow my problem....p  pIt seems twitter is quite picky in what they think is an url I got the most basic ones starting with https and such, but twitter also replaces some tlds very easily, www.google.com [whatever].net.biz.info are just a few of them but not .nl .de .tk p  pNow I was wondering if perhaps someone has found out which ones they do and which ones they dont shorten.p  pnow because Im pretty sure my regex isnt the best either Ill drop that here as wellp  precodehttphttps[w].[w][w.,ampamp][wampamp][w].[w][w.,ampamp][wampamp] codepre

All products are based on weight so when a products weighs more, then the shipping costs change to a method with id core1029240693 and core1029240718 see the code and have all different prices off course. All dynamically so the json will always have the pick up method and an actual shipping method. p  pWhat I try to achieve is  a shorten the code.

Im not familiar enough with rakefile structure to refactor this into a simple script that I can run, either via ruby rakeosx.rb or even rake. p  pIf someone can suggest to me how to modify this rakefile to run independently, or point me to another example project, or even share some code, I would be grateful. The project I am working on is better suited for Ruby than Python better library support in Ruby, but I am not going to invest time in it if deployment wont work. Python has a much richer tradition of deployment tools than Ruby, something Iv never quite understood.p

The svnserve   program behaves normally communicating via stdin and stdout, and   assumes that the traffic is being automatically redirected over some   sort of tunnel back to the client. When svnserve is invoked by a   tunnel agent like this, be sure that the authenticated user has full   read and write access to the repository database files.

Negative 1378 pWhen my application starts, and it has just been upgraded, I am doing a local database update sqlite. p  pIt is like that The user starts my app, and then I start the upgrade process.  During this upgrade process I am showing a form that has a continuous progressbar.  This form closes when the upgrade process is done and the user can then start using my application.p  pBut the progressbar wont animate since the upgrade process is so intensive. p  pIn my old VB6 version I used an ActiveXExe that has 1 form and shows a progressbar. This was my background worker.p  pI am not sure if I can use the same approach in VB.NET.p  pI have only seen examples that then do the work in the background worker, but I have not seen any examples where the progressbar itself was the background worker.p  pThe database upgrade needs to be blocking, the user may NOT use my application before the database upgrade was done. This means that only the progressbar should out of process, but not the upgrading. p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 1378 pFor the most part, the library Im developing is going to be consumed internally by one or more projects.  With that in mind, should I add logic that performs type checking on all parameters for functions I write, on some parameters or none  To do selective type checking, I feel, would create an inconsitent feel to the API, to do it for all parameters would bloat the code, and to do it for none could lead to error messages that arent helpful.  Any guidance as to why or why not would be appreciated.p

Negative 1378 pim new to programming so this may have a simple solution.

What I really want to do is assume that the data is valid  there is exactly one first value, and all others have follows values that follow one other node in the list.  Code like this would be good codeFindFirstForwardscode is a custom extension method I wrote to find the first linked list entry for which the given lambda returns truep  precodeLinkedListltCarInstancegt orderedCars  new LinkedListltCarInstancegt XPathNodeIterator xmlIterator  nav.Selectdfltcarsdfltcar, namespaceResolver while xmlIterator.MoveNext      if xmlIterator.Current.Selectfollows.Count gt 0          orderedCars.AddFirstnew CarInstance              CarId  int.ParsexmlIterator.Current.GetAttributeid, defaultNamespace                   else          orderedCars.AddAfterorderedCars.FindFirstForwardscar gt car.CarId  int.ParsexmlIterator.Current.GetAttributefollows, defaultNamespace, new CarInstance              CarId  int.ParsexmlIterator.Current.GetAttributeid, defaultNamespace                codepre  pThe trouble is, if the car that this one follows has not yet been added to codeorderedCarscode, an exception is thrown because codeFindFirstForwardscode didnt find a car with the follows ID.  What I really want to do is say add this to the linked list, assume it will follow some future entry with a certain ID even though that entry hasnt yet been added, and carry on.  Then at the end, check the integrity of the linked list to make sure each node points to another, and that there is one head node.p  pIs there a concise way of doing this  If not, what would be the most efficient and preferably, codeconcise way of converting this XML into an inmemory linked listp

Negative 1378 pSo recently i thought i figured out a solution for it, only to find out it doesnt work when i have more than one of the same object type added to the level.p  pWhat i was doing is iterating through my different list of objects and checking if any of them are colliding with the player, if they are i play the sound for that one colliding with the player and then i set the boolean for the sound to true, meaning the sound has been played now. p  pWhen their are no collisions going on or if the current object being iterated isnt colliding with the player i set the sound boolean back to false. So as you probably can see, there is a issue when there is more than one of the same objects added because one of them will set the boolean to false and the sound will be played over and over as long as the player is colliding with one of the objects.p  pSo i have run out of solutions to fix this so i am seeking out help. p  pThanks anyone who can offer assistance. p

Negative 1378 pLets say you are using a library that returns error codes. Youd like to write a wrapper for the library, and youd like to handle errors with exceptions in the code.p  pIf the library is still in development by someone else, and if the error codes may change there can be new ones, there can be deprecated ones, or some error codes may change meaning slightly, what would your solution be to handle thisp  pThis is the situation that Im in right now. In my case, the library is written in C, and were using C. The coder of the library says the error codes may change, and I have to find a way to work with it.p  pOur initial solution is top  ol liCreate an XML file that has the error codes in different categories terminal ones, input errors, and so on.li liWrapper fetches these error codes on start.li liThrows the appropriate exception by checking the category of the error code.li ol  pSo lets say a method returns error code 100, then the wrapper checks the category of the error code. If it is a emterminal errorem it throws a emterminal error exceptionem, if it is a emuser input errorem it throws a emuser input error exceptionem.p  pThis should work, but I feel like this is not the optimal solution. Id like to know how good written enterprise software handle change of error codes.p  pWhat would you suggest doingp  pstrongEditstrong I have already questioned the fact that error codes will be changing and the coder of the library says the code is in development. Its an algorithm, so even the way the algorithm works changes as its original research hes writing his PhD on that. So he says there may be different errors, or some may be irrelevant in the future.p

Negative 1378 pI have earlier used Crucible to setup code review for the code lying in SVN. I remember there used to be feature either to select difference between two version of files, or I was able to select whole file. I always found selecting whole file better as it gave view of the whole code and I used to get committer name and version against each line on Crucible GUI, to get an idea what has been committed recently on a file.p  pNow I am to setup review of the code which is present in Accurev. If I select whole files instead of only difference, I donot get to see this history information on the file being reviewed. So the reviewer doesnt have an idea which part of file is recently updated and hence is to be reviewed. Or the other option is to select difference only, which is not so user friendly on Crucible UI to be reviewed.p  pAm I missing some option on crucible while creating review or is this a limitation of accurevp

Negative 1378 pI am trying to read binary data from a mixed data file ascii and binary using R, the data file is constructed in a pseudoxml format. The idea I had was to use the scan function, read the specific lines and then convert the binary to numerical values but I cant seem to do this in R. I have a python script that does this, but I would like to do the job in R, the python script is below. The binary section within the data file is enclosed by the start and end tags  and .p  pThe data file is a proprietary format containing spectroscopic data, a link to an example data file is included below. To quote the user manualp  blockquote   pData of BinData elements are written as a binary array of bytes. Each   8 bytes of the binary array represent a one doubleprecision   floatingpoint value. Therefore the size of the binary array is   NumberOfPoints  8 bytes. For twodimensional arrays, data layout   follows rowmajor form used by SafeArrays. This means that moving to   next array element increments the last index. For example, if a   twodimensional array e.g. Datai,j is written in such   onedimensional binary byte array form, moving to the next 8 byte   element of the binary array increments last index of the original   twodimensional array i.e. Datai,j1. After the last element of   the binary array the combination of carriage return and linefeed   characters ANSI characters 13 and 10 is written.p blockquote  pThanks for any suggestions in advancep  pLink to example data file p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B5F27d7b1eMfQWg0QVRHUWUwdk0edituspsharing relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B5F27d7b1eMfQWg0QVRHUWUwdk0edituspsharingap  pPython scriptp  precodeimport sys, struct, csv fopensys.argv[1], rb  t  f.read i  t.findltBinDatagt  lenltBinDatagt  2  add rn line end header  t[i]  t  t[i] i  t.findrnltBinDatagt bin  t[i]  doubles[] for i in rangelenbin8   doubles.appendstruct.unpackd, bin[i8i18][0]  footer  t[i2]  myfile  openoutput.csv, wb wr  csv.writermyfile, quotingcsv.QUOTEALL wr.writerowdoubles codepre

Negative 1378 pIm new to and am loving Meteor. But, of course, every framework with nice features has flaws. For Meteor, it seems like the flaw is the amount of clientside scripts that have to be loaded to get an app rolling. Because of this, a relatively empty meteor app can take a bit longer to actually render anything than Id like. I feel like it makes the site seem like its broken for the first 6 seconds.p  pI know I could remove dependencies to save some time. Im sure things are a bit better compressed outside of production mode as well, but in case this doesnt help when my app is finished, Id like to be able to give the user some indication that the page is working. p  pOne way I thought of doing this would be to add a background style while the scripts are loading. The problem with this seems to be that anything you add to a codeheadcode tag in meteor gets loaded emafterem the 20 or so scripts. p  pstrongIs there any way to put codestylecode tags above Meteors codescriptcode tags and have styles render before scripts load and start processingstrong p

Negative 1378 pI am using BFS to compute some paths in a graph and am computing the partial paths to each node. That is just an overview of the actual problem.p  pThe issue in question is, let us say that I have two nodes with a link in between them. All of them have three parameters, modeled as a list with three values only.p  pContents of path uptil node A is in listA, link parameters are stored in listC and the result of adding both of them go into a listB which is part of node B.p  pFor example, listA  [0,0,1] and listC  [1,1,1]. I am doing a pairwise addition on the lists, like p  precodelistB[0]  listA[0]  listC[0] listB[1]  listA[1]  listC[1] listB[2]  listA[2]  listC[2] codepre  pSo, at the end of the operation, I should have listB  [1,1,2]. As far as I am aware, listA should not be mutated in anyway. But when I perform this operation, listA and listB end up having the same values, even though listA is not on the LHS of any operation. Is there any Pythony concept that I am missing here I thought lists were immutable in their original form.p
Negative 1378 pI have been haunted by a trivial problem for a while. I just installed PIL package and I have no problem importing it and using it both from my command line python and eclipse python. And I used sys.path to check they have almost exactly the same path. However, In eclipse, it always shows the red error dot on the screen that there is something wrong with the library unresolved import, which is absolutely nonsense. I could run the code and see the expected output which means that the module has been imported successfully p  pI am wondering has this happened to any of you guys. I could move on with my work but.. it is just super annoying working on something that always shows Error.

Negative 1378 pWe are considering building a Excellike app in AngularJS where we would like undoredo support for the cell editing.p  pAny advice on the best strategy to implement thisp  pI am not just thinking of undoing text just entered in a textbox. I mean entering data in several cells and then undoing each of those entries.p  pI have experimented with pushing the current model on a stack before each modification. That makes it possible to undo by restoring the model to a previous state. However, how do I combine this with REST CRUD interactionp  pThe natural way of resolving the CRUD is to do an immediate REST call to the backend  updating the database for each modification. But then undoing will just modify model in Angular, not the database. And there is no simple way of posting the delta between the two models over REST.p

Negative 1378 pThis post is about Android. The following is what is happeningp  pIm loading JSON and putting this into a ListView. Now, an item in this ListView is basically an ImageView and a TextView.p  pBecause the ImageViews image can be up to 2MB large, I want to load the ImageViews Drawable async after loading the ListView also done Async.p  pHow should I do this I already created 2 AsyncTasks, one for loading the list and another one for loading a Drawable based on URL. Both work, but I dont know how to inform the ListView that the Drawable is updated.p  pCurrently, the Drawable shows when I scroll down and the item goes out of view. Then I scroll back and I see the image is updated. I think this is because I set the image in getView ArrayAdapter and this gets called when an item gets into view.p  pAll data gets stored in an ArrayList of BlablaItem. Lets say BlablaItem contains String title, String imageUrl and Drawable image. Perfect would be to just update this Drawable in the class and that the ListView updates it too automatically...p  pSo my question is how to do all this nicely, where to create my AsyncTask for the Drawable currently in the loop to process JSON, where to create my AsyncTask currently in the ArrayAdapter constructor and how to signal the ListView that the Drawable has been updated. p

Negative 1378 pSo I have a webpage with text that is not allowed to scroll vertically.p  pThis means that when text overflows I need it to overflow horizontally. What I am trying to do is separate it into columns. Basically, as the section of text gets too tall for the height of its parent it would form columns like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaqhY6.png altText Overflow Examplep  pI know that the columns can easily be achieved with an HTML table. However, I dont know how many columns I am going to need, partly because the height of the parent is subject to change, and partly because I need it to work when things like the fontsize change. I can think of a couple ways to do this with some javascript, but I was wondering p  pIs there any way to get this behavior with just HTML and CSSp

Negative 1378 pI am writing some very lowlevel C code to emulate a file system for a homework project.

If you want to encode x and y, they multiply y by some factor and then add x to it.  Well this makes since on paper, but I dont understand how in the world it can work when stored to a floating value.  Floating values only have 7 significant digits.  If you add a big number and a small number, the small number is just truncated and lost.  The precision only shows the value of the big number.p  pSince everyone seems to prescribe the same method, I tried it myself and it did exactly what I thought it would do.

Negative 1378 pWere trying to create a setup of multiple APIs via the Amazon AWS Elastic Beanstalk AEB component. The reason we have chosen AEB is because it provides seamless deployment and scaling for the applications we deploy, without the need to manually create Load Balancers LB and scaling rules. We would very much like to keep it this way as we are planning on launching a large number of applications and APIs.p  pHowever, were facing a number of challenges with AEB.p  pFirst and foremost, some of the APIs need to communicate internally, and low latency is a core requirement for us. In order to utilize internal network communication in AEB we have been forced top  ol liAllocate a VPC in Amazonli liDeploy each application to this VPC  each behind their own internal LBli ol  pNow, when using the Elastic beanstalk URLs the APIs are able to resolve the internal IP of the LB of another API and thus the latency is eliminated and all is good  the APIs can communicate with one another.p  pHowever, this spawns another issue for us Some of these internally allocated APIs remember, theyre behind an internal LB in a VPC must also be  accessible from the internet.p  pWe still havent found a way to make the internal LBs internet accessible while keeping their ability to also act as internal LB, so any help on this matter is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1378 pOk This question is directed to the cakePHP ninjas out there. I have just started using cakePHP in my projects after going through their documentation. p  pI have an action which I want the user to access only via POST request rather then a GET request.

Any remarks appreciated  p  pEdit Specific Question  How can I catch the error with cakePHP  please help if you can, even if you feel that this is very trivial for you p

This means that it turns the operations queue off so the app wont communicate with the server, even though it most certainly could.p  pAny suggestions why AFNetworking incorrectly reports the local serverURL as not reachablep  pHeres my codep  precodeAFHTTPRequestOperationManager mgr  [[AFHTTPRequestOperationManager alloc] initWithBaseURL[NSURL URLWithStringhttp192.168.188.203000]] NSOperationQueue operationQueue  self.httpManager.operationQueue  [mgr.reachabilityManager setReachabilityStatusChangeBlockAFNetworkReachabilityStatus status             NSLogReachability for  has changed to , http192.168.188.203000,AFStringFromNetworkReachabilityStatusstatus           switch status              case AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWWAN             case AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWiFi                 NSLogreenabling operation queue                 [operationQueue setSuspendedNO]                 break             case AFNetworkReachabilityStatusNotReachable             default                 NSLogdisabling operation queue                 [operationQueue setSuspendedYES]                 break              ] codepre  pWhen I run the app I get the following log output  WLAN is working fine, local server is running at the given IP and port numberp  precodeJan 31 132104  MyApp[10671] ltWarninggt Reachability for http192.168.188.203000 has changed to Reachable via WiFi Jan 31 132104  MyApp[10671] ltWarninggt reenabling operation queue Jan 31 132104  MyApp[10671] ltWarninggt Reachability for http192.168.188.203000 has changed to Not Reachable Jan 31 132104  MyApp[10671] ltWarninggt disabling operation queue codepre  pThe same thing happens when I try it with a live server, i.e. outside the local LAN.

Negative 1378 pIm trying to build a simple switch case demo here and I had it working on my school server and am now trying to carry it over to my server now that the quarter is over. I dont know what happened, the switch case  was working but no longer is and I am trying to repair it. Paths are good, and ive gone through the file forwards and backwards trying to find the error in my logic, looked for missing semicolons, and everything else that i can think to do. Im stumped and not sure what the issue is but it seems my switch case isnt delivering anything and is somehow broken.p  pThe switch case, when working, would ideally display the date, a poster graphic and unique background image to the client Browser. p  pjpg of how page would display a hrefhttpschool.maxomatic.comitc240imgimg240a010sm.jpg relnofollowhttpschool.maxomatic.comitc240imgimg240a010sm.jpga Link to page a hrefhttpschool.maxomatic.comitc240itc240a020index.php relnofollowhttpschool.maxomatic.comitc240itc240a020index.phpap  precodeltphp     a3DatesConditionals.php      Create a page with the following functionality    Use PHP to deliver a different image and bit of content    for each weekday Sunday to Saturday using one PHP file.

However from browser, I get Origin is not allowed by AccessControlAllowOrigin Chrome or Error 415 Unsupported Media Type Firefox and it seems the POST request is not even sent at all.p  pThe requesting jQuery code is simply as followsp  precodedocument.readyfunction           .posturl,                             params params,             ,             function data                  handle response                    codepre  pI have read the CORS spec and all the resources I could find, tried any possible combination of the AccessControlAllow headers with and without AccessControlAllowCredentials, different content of AccessControlAllowHeaders and AccessControlAllowMethods, AccessControlAllowOrigin set to  or the single Origin etc.. I have also tried running the script from disk Origin null, webserver Origin localhost8888 and remote server Origin standard url, because some browsers apparently block requests with local origin, but always the same negative result.p  pAny help how to get this working would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 1378 pFor work, I have to connect to dozens of Linux machines via SSH to perform maintenance, monitor the system, install software, etc.p  pI have a small arsenal of scripts that help me do some of these tasks, and these are located in a folder on my Mac in Usersmebin. I want to be able to run these scripts on the remote Linux machine, but for several reasons I do not want these scripts permanently located on these machines e.g., other people also connect to these remote machines, and it would be unwise to let them execute these files.p  pstrongSo, is possible to share scripts across an SSH connection for the lifetime of the session onlystrongp  pI have a couple of ideas on how to do this, but I dont know if any of them will work. Firstly, if SSH allows file mounting, I could automatically mount memymacUsersmebin to melinuxremotebin when I connect to the remote Linux box, and set my PATH variable to PATHremotebin. Secondly, I could set up port forwarding in the connection string e.g., codessh melinux R 9999127.0.0.1ltSMBPORTETCgtcode and every time I connect mount the share and set the PATH variable.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ive come up with a semisolution. On the linux machine, edit codeetcsshsshdconfigcode to add the following subsystem codeSubsystem shareduserbinary sudo su l c binmount t cifs o port9999,usernameme,nounix,secntlmssp 127.0.0.1exportedbin mntremotebin ampamp bash l i scode. When connecting to the remote machine, set up a reverse port forward and invoke the subsystem. E.g. codessh R 9999127.0.0.1445 s shareduserbinary melinuxcode.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong You can make the solution above cleaner, by removing the codelcode from the codesudocode command and changing the path from codemntremotebincode to codeHOMErbincode.p

Too bad I dont have any KitKat device to test it. For now Im testing in KitKat using the DDMS telephony tab. Ive added logging to the receiver but I dont see anything in logcat. There are no exceptions nor any other message that could indicate problems.

Could any one tell me why it is not uploading the image. It happens in this context only. I tried to add a form in the same checkout page. If i do upload the image from the form i can able to get it. But i couldnt get it through woocommerce checkout form.p  pIs there something woocommerce is doingp  pI tried with ajax form to upload image using codejQuery Form Plugincode which is already available from wordpress. In here i can able to get the image but im afraid of the logic because once the user upload the image and if he didnt place the order then the uploaded image may go waste.p  pSo i need the file uploaded along with the form and tie it to the order. How to do this Why i couldnt get codeFILEScode when i try to get from codewoocommercecheckoutprocesscode Hookp  pI know there is no problem with normal file upload in same page but with different form. When i try from woocommerce checkout form then there i couldnt get the codeFILEScode.p  pThey are using ajax before place order, is that the reason am not getting the codeFILEScode array. If so can i replace the normal ajax and use codejQuery Form Plugincode so that i can get the codeFILEScode p  pAny help or reference about the problem will be very helpful to me.p

Negative 1378 pI have a device that is coded in CPP connected to my Ubuntu PC, and I am attempting to communicate with it using my Python node. Basically the attempt is to receive messages from the device, and then send messages to it Baud rate is 230400. By default, the device only publishes a heartbeat message at a very low freq.  0.1 0.2 Hz. The messages that are sent to the device are around 2 Hz. they can be up to 200 Hz when I finish my complete implementation. In the default case, I am able to receive the heartbeat and send my messages properly from the PC. p  pBut because I needed more information than just the heartbeat, I included some more messages to be sent from the device, increased the frequency to about 2 Hz. But then, I am able to receive those messages from the device properly, but the messages I am sending to the device drop after some time. On the PC end, the sender  receiver are packaged into the same Python script. If I relaunch the script, it works again for a small amount of time, then stops.p  pThe amount of time it takes to stop decreases as I increase the amount of data being sent from device to the PC or its frequency.p  pTo recapp  pCase 1 Device sending at 0.1 Hz, PC sending at 2 Hz, sendingreceiving fine work on both ends.p  pCase 2 Device sending at 12 Hz, PC sending at 2 Hz, Device sends, PC receives. PC sends, device stops receiving after some time.p  pThe way the port is opened in Python goes like thisp  precodedef initself, device, baud230400, autoreconnectFalse, sourcesystem255     import serial     self.baud  baud     self.device  device     self.autoreconnect  autoreconnect     self.port  serial.Serialself.device, self.baud, timeout0,                               dsrdtrFalse, rtsctsFalse, xonxoffFalse codepre  pI am not very knowledgeable about the low level aspects of serial port comms. I have tried tweaking parameters such as buffer sizes, timeouts etc. on the device but nothing worked. It would be very helpful if anyone can shed some light on why this problem is occurring, or what the red flags are that I should look for inside the code. Unfortunately, the complete code thats on the device is quite extensive to display here, so I can include specific portions if needed. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1378 pIve been trying to learn Twill Scripting on Python and I am using strongPython 3.4 and Twill 1.8.0strong. Been reading some posts here and I found it interesting to study. But, I do have a problem installing Twill. I just knew that strongPRINTstrong in Python is now a function so meaning it needs parenthesis and thats where my problem starts. As I look through the codes on Twill 1.8.0, I think it isnt oriented with the change of using PRINT yet. Strings are not enclosed with parenthesis so I was thinking maybe there is a new patch or version of Twill that adapts the changes of Python, is there any or is there anything I can do about this aside from manually editing Twill filesp  pYour response is highly appreciated.p

Negative 1378 pI want to use the color theme solarizedlight.

Some of the colors are applied but others arent, I assume this is because its not running in a GUI so it assumes the terminal cant support the colors or something.p  pLogically, I tried putting the call to load the theme in the codeaftermakeframefunctionscode variable. I thought that if it only tries to load the theme after Im already in a GUI, then it should work rightp  pIt doesnt.

Negative 1378 pIn a simple MVVM application, I can add a binding to some property in the view. The property may access another object and return a property value from it.

If I just returned the projects name in the property, it wont be updated of course.p  pSo I thought I could just bind the view to another binding created in the property, that should forward the PropertyChanged event and update the view accordingly.

What I intend to do is to develop an interface between this system and Nest via the API.  p  pMy reasoning for this is to use the motion detection from the alarms PIR sensors to inform Nest that someone is still on the premises due to their movement and hence prevent Nest switching to its AutoAway state when the house is inhabited.p  pAlso when the house is armed in awaymode I would want Nest to enter AutoAway state immediately.p  pSo what Id like to know is whether its possible to do the following via the APIp  p1 Keepswitch Nest into the Home 2 Place Nest in the AutoAway statep  pCheers Ianp

Negative 1378 pI want to enhance the project job scheduling example from Optaplanner with adding priority to each project. Lets say, each project has its own priority 1 High, 2 Medium, 3 Low, and project with higher priority will be executed first, if projects have same priority, it will be executed based on its order first come first serve. If we take this example  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7SdzM.png altenter image description here Lets say project Book1 has medium priority and Book2 project has High priority, which mean project Book2 should be executed first before project Book1, and of course the result will be different from the picture above. I need suggestion on how to implement this additional requirement. One solution that already in my mind was to sort all projects data list before give it to Optaplanner to solve it, but that solution seems to be a little strange.  Any suggestions and comments will be appreciated. Thanks amp Regards.p

I found that the following piece of code initializes the interface in some static way I dont really understand why, please explain if you know, which I then call once at class init, and you can then set the card of the color with the above chunk of code.p  precodefinal RectF sCornerRect  new RectF MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadow.sRoundRectHelper                  new MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadow.RoundRectHelper              Override             public void drawRoundRectCanvas canvas, RectF bounds, float cornerRadius,                                       Paint paint                  final float twoRadius  cornerRadius  2                 final float innerWidth  bounds.width  twoRadius                 final float innerHeight  bounds.height  twoRadius                 sCornerRect.setbounds.left, bounds.top,                         bounds.left  cornerRadius  2, bounds.top  cornerRadius  2                 canvas.drawArcsCornerRect, 180, 90, true, paint                 sCornerRect.offsetinnerWidth, 0                 canvas.drawArcsCornerRect, 270, 90, true, paint                 sCornerRect.offset0, innerHeight                 canvas.drawArcsCornerRect, 0, 90, true, paint                 sCornerRect.offsetinnerWidth, 0                 canvas.drawArcsCornerRect, 90, 90, true, paint                 draw top and bottom pieces                 canvas.drawRectbounds.left  cornerRadius, bounds.top,                         bounds.right  cornerRadius, bounds.top  cornerRadius,                         paint                 canvas.drawRectbounds.left  cornerRadius,                         bounds.bottom  cornerRadius, bounds.right  cornerRadius,                         bounds.bottom, paint                 center                 canvas.drawRectbounds.left, bounds.top  cornerRadius,                         bounds.right, bounds.bottom  cornerRadius, paint                       codepre  pThis solution does however spawn a new problem. Not sure what happens on prelollipop, but when the CardView is first initialized it appears to create a RoundRectDrawable as the background from the attributes youve set in XML. When we then change the color with the above code, we set a MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadow as the background, and if you then want to change the color once again, the card.getRadius, card.getCardElevation etc, will no longer work.p  pThis therefore first tries to parse the background it gets from the CardView as a MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadow from which it then gets the values if it succeeds which it will the second time you change the color. But, if it fails which is will on the first color change, because the background is a different class it will get the values directly from the CardView itself.p  precode    float cardRadius     float maxCardElevation      try         MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadow background  MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadowcard.getBackground         cardRadius  background.getCornerRadius         maxCardElevation  background.getMaxShadowSize     catch ClassCastException classCastExeption         cardRadius  card.getRadius         maxCardElevation  card.getMaxCardElevation           card.setBackgroundDrawable             new MyRoundRectDrawableWithShadowcontext.getResources,                     Color.parseColornote.getColor,                     cardRadius,                     card.getCardElevation,                     maxCardElevation codepre  pHope that made sense, Im not a native English speaker...

Negative 1378 pI have a large number of intervals genomic intervals in my case. All these intervals have multipleentities. I want to associate these multiple entities together in some way I want to see for each interval how correlated they are with each other. What would be a good way to analyse this data. The number of data points in each interval depends on the length of the interval and thus the problem would need a good data structure to handle it. I came across interval graphs but I was wondering how can I implement it and moreover quickly calculate correlation of different entities across all the intervals. If somebody has experience in using interval graphs for such an exercise please let me know. Also when done with this exercise what would be a good way to visualize the data.p  pthanksp

Negative 1378 pI have two directories called codemediacode and codestaticcode.p  pWhen I have codeDEBUG  Truecode everything works but if I change it to codeDEBUG  Falsecode the problems arises.p  pIve read that my server will handle static files in production. I have understood it asp  pIn development its fine to have all my static files in my directory codestaticcode but when I go in production I need to move all my static files to another directory it could be codestaticwwwcode and before starting the server I run codepython manage.py collectstaticcode. This command will move all the files from codestaticwwwcode to codestaticcode and everything works.p  pBut why do I need to have two separate directories with same content How do the server know that my files has been collected through codecollectstaticcode its just files in a folder so how can it know the difference I guess codecollectstaticcode is primarily used when you have static files in multiple directories and want to collect them all before you go into production.p  pThe variables in my codesettings.pycode looks likep  precodeSTATICROOT  os.path.joinBASEDIR, static  STATICURL  static  STATICFILESDIRS       os.path.joinBASEDIR, staticwww,   STATICFILESFINDERS       django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder,     django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder,   MEDIAROOT  os.path.joinBASEDIR, media  MEDIAURL  media codepre  pand it moves from codestaticwwwcode to codestaticcode so neither in production nor development my directory codestaticwwwcode is not used.p  pMaybe all these settings are meant for websites which has another server only for handling static filesp

Negative 1378 pI have a legacy database atop RHEL that uses Oracle database users and roles for authentication and access.  We are running Oracle fusion middleware for the UI Oracle forms, currently on Windows servers.  The login screen asks for username, password, and database name and once a user enters those, the forms server communicates with the database server to verify credentials.  If successful, the user is passed onto an Oracle forms environment, which gives access to various components of the application by checking Oracle database roles.p  pWe have separate, newer applications that use Redhat 389 Directory Server for auth amp access.  p  pI am hoping to get some advice on how best to migrate authentication and access from the database and forms server to the 389 server.  We are researching shibboleth as an Identity Provider and Service Provider.  I am speculating that we could alter the forms server to use shibboleth to authenticate, and create a service that synchronizes the database roles with roles in the 389 directory server.p

The idea of the code is to do pairwise comparisons between data points. Any ideas how I could reduce the time complexity of my codep  pThe idea behind the CIvalue or Cindex, is to measure how well a prediction model was able to rank data points into correct order. What you give to this function is a set of observed values X and their corresponding predictions Y. The function will do the ranking comparison between data points that have different observed values, because they obviously have a ranking. p  pFor example, lets say you have a two observed values for some variable, e.g. stock price P1  5, P2  7p  pNow we create a model that will try to predict the stock prices. Lets say we builded our model and tested its ability to predict the stock price and for the two data points P1, P2 it predicted the values Y1  5.5 and Y2  8. p  pNow you can see that the model got the ORDER correct, P1 lt P2 ampamp Y1 lt Y2 but not the absolute value. This is useful when we need to make selections between a set of alternatives, e.g. which stock should I buy that will increase in value most etc. p  pThank you for all help Please let me know if you need any more information etc.  p  pHere is the comparison between my own and Martins implementation p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG9XgV.png altenter image description herep
Negative 1378 pIm getting a 500 internal server error and I am not sure how I can pinpoint the error. Below is my code. In app.py, if I change the result to helloworld, it works fine, but for some reason it doesnt like my python script. The files run locally but its only when I deploy to Heroku that I receive this error. Could it be that I am not handling the Get request appropriately or that Heroku doesnt understand how to handle itp  papp.pyp  precodefrom flask import Flask, rendertemplate, request, jsonify import

Negative 1378 pI am trying to write a simple script that will read in a fits image file, set all pixels that are below a certain threshold that I will feed in based on background statistics to zero or nan. I have included below the code that I am using. This writes a new fits file that resembles the original, but the pixel values seem to be rescaled ie, I would expect the minimum value in the new file to be the minimum that I specified, but that is not the case.

Negative 1378 pLets say we have a UserControl like thisp  precodeltUserControl xClass...gt     ltStackPanelgt         ltTextBlock NameTextBlock1 gt         ltTextBlock NameTextBlock2 gt         ltTextBlock NameTextBlock3 gt         ...         ltTextBlock NameTextBlock10 gt     ltStackPanelgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pAnd we have properties defined like thisp  precodepublic string Text1  get set  public string Text2  get set  public string Text3  get set  ... public string Text10  get set  codepre  pAnd know I want to bind all those TextBlocks to all those properties. There are obviously multiple ways of doing this and I wonder about the disadvantages of the different ones. Lets make a listp  ol lipMy first approach was thisp  precodeltTextBlock NameTextBlock1 TextBinding PathText1, RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypeUserControl gt codepre  pThis works and is fairly simple, but it is a lot of redundant code if I have to type it for all the TextBlocks. In this example we could just copypaste, but the UserControl could be more complex.pli lipWhen I googled the problem I found this solutionp  precodeltUserControl ...     DataContextBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Selfgt     ltTextBlock NameTextBlock1 TextBinding PathText1 gt codepre  pThis looks pretty clean in the xaml, however DataContext could be used otherwise. So if someone uses this UserControl and changes the DataContext, we are screwed.pli lipAnother common solution seems to be thisp  precodeltUserControl ...     xNameMyUserControlgt     ltTextBlock NameTextBlock1 TextBinding PathText1, ElementNameMyUserControl gt codepre  pThis has the same problem as 2. though, Name could be set from somewhere else.pli lipWhat if we write our own MarkupExtensionp  precodepublic class UserControlBindingExtension  MarkupExtension      public UserControlBindingExtension        public UserControlBindingExtensionstring path              this.Path  path           private Binding binding  null      private string path      [ConstructorArgumentpath]      public string Path              get                      return path                  set                      this.path  value             binding  new Bindingthis.path             binding.RelativeSource  new RelativeSourceRelativeSourceMode.FindAncestor, typeofUserControl, 1                    public override object ProvideValueIServiceProvider serviceProvider              ifbinding  null             return null          return binding.ProvideValueserviceProvider       codepre  pNow we can do something like thisp  precodeltUserControl ...     xmlnsselfclrnamespaceMyProjectgt     ltTextBlock NameTextBlock1 TextselfUserControlBinding PathText1 codepre  pNeat But Im not conviced if my implementation is bulletproof and I would prefer not writing my own MarkupExtension.pli lipSimilar to 4. we could do thisp  precodepublic class UserControlBindingHelper  MarkupExtension      public UserControlBindingHelper        public UserControlBindingHelperBinding binding              this.Binding  binding           private Binding binding     [ConstructorArgumentbinding]     public Binding Binding              get                      return binding                  set                      binding  value             binding.RelativeSource  new RelativeSourceRelativeSourceMode.FindAncestor, typeofUserControl, 1                    public override object ProvideValueIServiceProvider serviceProvider              if binding  null             return null          return binding.ProvideValueserviceProvider       codepre  pWhich would result in code like thisp  precodeltTextBlock NameTextBlock1 TextselfUserControlBindingHelper Binding Text1 gt codepreli lipWe could do it in codep  precodeprivate void setBindingToUserControlFrameworkElement element, DependencyProperty dp, string path      Binding binding  new Bindingpath     binding.RelativeSource  new RelativeSourceRelativeSourceMode.FindAncestor, typeofStateBar, 1     element.SetBindingdp, binding  codepre  pAnd then we do thisp  precodesetBindingToUserControlthis.TextBlock1, TextBlock.Text, Text1 codepre  pFairly nice, but it makes the xaml harder to read, since the information about the bindings is missing now.pli lipWhat other goodinteresting options are therepli ol  pSo what is the way to go in which situation Did I make a mistake somewherebr To specify the questionbr Are all those ways correct Are some superior to othersp

Negative 1378 pWe have a VB6 DLL which includes several enum definitions. We have loaded the VB6 DLL as a reference in a C project. p  pIn the Visual Studio 2010 object browser, all the VB6 classes are visible, as are the enum emnamesem. However, the enum emvaluesem are not shown, and also are not listed when using intellisense within C code. However the enum name does come up from intellisense, as do all the class names and class methods, properties etc. that I have tried. So only the values seem to be left out.p  pIf I click the enum name in a code window and select Go To Definition, I get something like thisp  precodenamespace DLLName      [Guid3DD0C7972BF04A7A8E1E83E3095CB3AE]     public enum EnumName            codepre  pWhich shows the same thing  enum exists with no values.p  pSo the question is  emwhere did the enum values go, and is there something we can do to get them to show upemp  pNote  I could modify the VB6 DLL if necessary.p  pThanksp

Negative 1378 pSo Im trying to make an algorithm that starts at the first room and then recursively goes outward and starts deleting all rooms from the outside in.

Negative 1378 pIm writing an app which uses a lot of Google APIs, and the user authentication is handled by Google OAuth2 sign in. My app is for creating video courses which can be shared with anyone in their Google Apps domain, whether it be a user, group or the entire domain.p  pThe way Ive handled sharing up until now is first check whether the input email address is a user or group, and if its a user, just give that particular user access to the shared resource.p  pGroups get a little trickier. I can retrieve all members of a group using the codedirectory.members.listcode Google API method, and then I can store all the members in my DB, and then check when a user tries to access a resource if they have access to that resource.p  pThe problem occurs when a new user is added to a group, or someone is removed from the group. I could sync groups every night but this could get costly if I have to sync 100,000 groups Im likely to hit the rate limits and it isnt ideal new users have to wait until a sync occurs before they can access shared resources.p  pIs there a better wayp

Negative 1378 pI want to create a .kmz file that has codeltScreenOverlaygtcode elements that contain arbitrary HTML content, not just a single codeltIcongtcode image.p  pThe KML spec for codeltScreenOverlaygtcode a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comkmldocumentationkmlreferencescreenoverlay relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comkmldocumentationkmlreferencescreenoverlaya seems to say that the only thing you can put in a codeltScreenOverlaygtcode is a single image, via the codeltIcongtcode element. But codeltScreenOverlaygtcode also has a codeltStylegtcode so Im wondering if I can use the codeltBalloonStylegtcode element inside the codeltStylegtcode to specify arbitrary HTML to go into my codeltScreenOverlaygtcode. But when I read about codeltBalloonStylegtcode a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comkmldocumentationkmlreferenceballoonstyle relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comkmldocumentationkmlreferenceballoonstylea it seems to imply that balloons are only used for popups on placemarks.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I now see that codeltScreenOverlaygtcode can indeed have a codeltBalloonStylegtcode, but that shows not surprisingly as an actual balloon that pops up vertically over the icon and apparently only when I click the codeltScreenOverlaygtcode in the table of contents tree, not on the map itself. So thats not what I want. Also, I see that if I add text to the codeltdescriptiongtcode tag of the codeltScreenOverlaygtcode, that text appears in the table of contents tree but not onin the image on the map. So my question remainsp  pIs there any way to get arbitrary HTML instead of just a single image into a codeltScreenOverlaygtcode or perhaps some other element with the same behavior of being a box at a fixed position on the screen that does not move with the mapp  pI am mostly concerned with importing the .kmz file into Google Earth, not so much Google Maps.p

Negative 1378 pIm making a program to sort a list of strings Around 50 and they have a maximum of 10 characters. I have created 10 text boxes which will each take one character from the word. Id like fill in boxes randomly and come out with word matches but dont know where to start. Will I need to use a sorting algorithm to do what I need How do I make sure that the character is in the same position of all the words IE if I had the word Hello and Hi, if I filled in text box one with H it will return both since the first letter matches.
