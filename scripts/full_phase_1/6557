Positive 6557 pI asked from user to choose image from his gallery for his profile image. i saved the image as a bitmap and i displayed it in his profile activity. that means thet i know how to display bitmap and my method for choosing image from gallery works fine. now, i want to save it in database. i dont know if i should save only the path  as string or the bitmap as blob. if i save the path only, i think that other users can not see his image, becuase the image is stored in his DCIM, and other users dont have access to there.  so i decided to save the bitmap as blob. can someone please please give me working code for  saving bitmap in database blob i think, byte [] or something.  retrieve the data into sharedreference. from sharedpreferene eventually to bitmap again. if you have an idea for how saving the images not in db, answer that. i have heard that i should avoid of saving images in db becuase it slows the app. p

Positive 6557 pToday I started using the codeAssetManagercode from codelibGDXcode to load my assets. Before that I already loaded everything in a separate class, but I didnt use the codeAssetManagercode.br How I currently load the Bitmap Font     p  precodemanager.loadfontgoodneighborsunity.fnt, BitmapFont.class [...] bFont  manager.getfontgoodneighborsunity.fnt, BitmapFont.class codepre  pMy problem is that the bitmap font I use is upside down when I load it with the Asset Manager. This is due to the fact that in my orthographic camera, emyem is pointing down. In the Bitmap Font constructor there is a boolean to flip the font and avoid this problem. But there seems to be no such option when I load it with the codeAssetManagercode. There is probably a relatively easy solution to this, but I cant find any method that allows me to flip the font afterwards. Is there an option that allows me flip the bitmap font while using the codeAssetManagercodep

Positive 6557 pI have a program that displays a thumbnail of an image. There is a button that offers the user the option to open the image fullscreen using the machines default image viewer. However, every time I have tried this, it has crashed. Ive toyed around with it and here is what Ive found so farp  pThe image on the thumbnail is part of a codeListltBitmapgtcode called codeimagescode. When the button is clicked to open the image fullscreen, the code runs a function to find the index of the image currently being displayed, and then use codeProcess.Startimages[current]code to open the image in the viewer.p  pHere is the code that runs this so farp  precode    private void btnViewImageClickobject sender, EventArgs e              identify image displayed on screen         Bitmap displayImage  images[displayImageIndex]         get full file path of the image         string displayImagePath  Path.GetFullPathdisplayImage          instance of class to open specified image in image viewer         ProcessStartInfo imageStartInfo  new ProcessStartInfodisplayImagePath         assign maxwindow attribute to instance of class         imageStartInfo.WindowStyle  ProcessWindowStyle.Maximized         open path using assigned instance of class         Process.StartdisplayImagePath      codepre  pThe path method of Path.GetFileNamedisplayImage gives an error message because it requires a string to be passed as the parameter rather than the Bitmap. However, when I attempted to change it to codestring displayImagePath  Path.GetFullPathdisplayImage.ToStringcode, this caused the application to crash. When I stepped through the code I found that my use of the codedisplayImage.ToStringcode actually initialised codedisplayImagePathcode to codeSystem.Drawing.Bitmapcode simply giving the variable type in a string rather than anything to do with its location.p  pFollowing this experimentation, Im not really sure where to go next. I cant think of another method or route to doing this or any way to get the file path.p

Positive 6557 pIt writes to my BITMAP.bmp file but when I try to view it in Windows Photo Viewer It says Windows Photo Viewer cant open this picture because the file appears to be damaged, corrupted, or is too large. I know I probably should have put the functions into header files but I havent ever really delved deeply enough into a project to really make header files so I forgot how. If anyone knows the size limit for pictures in Windows Photo Viewer I would be very thankful. And I got some of these functions from MSDNunashamed. The error handling could be better but I dont have codeerrorhandler.hcode. I am not completely sure how all of the functions work because as I said I used some code from MSDN.

All of them conclude that the flickering is due to how the codeSurfaceViewcode handles buffering, using two surfaces to swap between. The solution consists of using a separate bitmap to draw all of the images to first, then drawing that bitmap to the codeSurfaceViewcode. As you can see, I have done this in my codecreateBitmapcode method, yet the flickering persists.p

Negative 6557 pI write tools that are used in a shared workspace. Since there are multiple OSs working in this space, we generally use Python and standardize the version that is installed across machines. However, if I wanted to write some things in C, I was wondering if maybe I could have the application wrapped in a Python script, that detected the operating system and fired off the correct version of the C application. Each platform has GCC available and uses the same shell.p  pOne idea was to have the C compiled to the users local bin, with timestamp comparison with C code so it is not compiled each run, but only when code is updated. Another was to just compile it for each platform, and have the wrapper script select the proper executable.p  pIs there an acceptedstable process for this Are there any catches Are there alternatives assuming the absolute need to use native C codep  pemClarification Multiple OSs are involved that do not share ABI.

Negative 6557 pDuring undergrad i opted to take a network programming course using the POSIX sockets for linux.  As a reference we used the book Internetworking using TCPIP comer and stevens. 2008 its a pretty dated and still applicatable texts which takes one through several server designs. p  pOne design that is not really featured in the book is the case there a client connects to the backend application server sends multiple requests to the server over a single TCP connection.  Since multiple requests comes via the slave socket to the server and responses send via the same slave socket.  The slave socket is becomes congested as response and requests are received via the same socket, would it be a better option to allow for a second TCP connection between the to endpoints to allow full duplex communication speed  What other architectures can be used to improve server performancep

I have tried playing around with the source control block elements and their settings. I have tried including the  element and manually running svn cleanup on the local working copy  but no luck.

Negative 6557 pI cant use unit tests for some parts of code so Im falling back to regression tests. I would like to check whether my program behaves in the same way after some modifications. And by behaviour I mean mostly a state of data structures.  So far I was serializing them into human readable text format and dumped to some files in the first run. Then in the next dumps I could compare whether the state changed or not. And update it if the change comes from a new feature and not from a bug.p  pI could use a library C to organize all that. Do you know any Together with dump files it would provide a cheap, massive unittest.p  pThe most cumbersome thing are the serialization procedures. Sometimes I just dump memory state, but when it is different its hard to reverse engineer. So I moved to another method. Now, during the compare phase I read a memory dump into a phantom object and run a specialized diff method operator with rich error reporting, which sometimes is easier to write than serializing to human readable text format. p  pBasically I feel like reinventing the wheel, so my questions are quite generalbr How do you perform regression testing if you do br Do you use any librarytoolkit br Have you ever implemented one for your own needs brp  pAnd just out of curiosity br Have you ever wanted to do regression testing, but something stopped youp

That said, when I try to run this script, which looks through a database file to find the appropriate article file, it doesnt retrieve anything. p  pBasically, this is a rudimentary old CMS, as I explain it, where it searched the PAG file for the filename and displayed it. I am a little bit lost here. Is there a reason why the mirroring doesnt work on the new site Ive checked the permissions, Ive checked that Perl is installed in the same emusretcem directories. I think it uses dbm because, a hrefhttpwww.willmaster.comblogcgibackupmovedbmfiles.php relnofollowaccording to another articlea, if I see commands like thesep  precode dbmopen ARTS, artdbm, 0644   entry  ARTSarticleid  dbmclose ARTS  codepre  pit must be dbm, rightp  pOn a related note, is there any way to merge that PAG files info with the original files without an incredibly sophisticated Perl script i.e., recreate the 100 text files with that info in the file itself, rather than stored separately p  pEDIT thanks for the 1st answer below. can you explain what that HASH may be, and the mask Ive doublechecked that the .pag file the database name is indeed in the place where its defined earlier in the .pl file, and that it was transferred in binary. yet somehow I cant get it to open it correctlyp  pstrongEDIT 3 Ok, sorry, final editing herestrong I used the die code below Shwern and found that it is not finding that DB file, despite it being there two files articles.pag and articles.dir, but the variable only references articles without extensions in the right directory and with the right permissions... So, the question here is now what the hell is going on are these different versions of perl or am i just doing something basic and stupid for the record yes, its terrible i dont have shell access just yet, though im working on it... I was asked to do this because of my new web skills, and Im certainly not the appropriate person for things like perl and dbm, though i can read the files and understand them. As a final suggestion, does anyone know how a script or the like I could ask the original server people who are NOT the coders to do an ASCII dump of this, or would that be out of line  I need to get this into CSV and back into the file so I can reuse it in another db... ugh what a nightmarep

It seems that there is, in general, a many to many relationship between the two.p  pThis means that even though Im only using a single managed thread, it could switch OS threads, and Ill loose access to a device pointer.p  pIs there any way to force the CLR to not move a managed thread between OS threadsp

Negative 6557 pCurrently Im working on a CC crossplatform clientserver software. Im very experienced developer when it comes to low level socket development. The problem with Berkley socketsWinsock, is that you always have to make some kind of parser to get things right on the receiver side. I mean, you have to interpret data, and concatenate packets in order to transmit correctly. packets often get sliced p  pHave in mind that the communication is going to be bidirectional. Is pure socket the best way to transmit data nowadays Would you recommend SOAP, Webservices or another kind of encapsulation to this application p

Negative 6557 pI cant imagine that my question is so specific to my case, but I did not see any similar questions asked here so far.p  pI would like to be able to specify a log4g.properties file outside of my .ear packaging so that it is easier to alter the logging levels without repackaging the ear. Actually, the most pressing motivation for doing it like that is our groups alreadyestablished convention of having the log4j properties files outside of the ear, so getting around that constraint by putting the log4j.properties file in the APPINFclasses dir, or the root of the ear, etc. is not applicable.p  pThe ear contains a stateless EJB that delegates to a series of Spring POJOs to accomplish its behavior.p  pIve seen others in my group deploy a WAR file inside the EAR with its only responsibility to load the log4j properties file from a specified external path using a context listener. Although the path is external to the EAR, its still on the classpath. For example, the folder config is on the classpath, and the WAR uses a context listener to load the log4j.properties from configappnamelog4j.properties.p  pTo me, using a WAR whose sole purpose is to load a log4.properties file is a hackoverkill.p  pThere HAS to be a better way, rightp

Negative 6557 pStackoverflow has a nifty badge system. One thing I noticed is that badges are not immediately awarded, but sometimes seem to have some type of a delay after I meet the criteria. Ive noticed this on some other sites that have badges as well.p  pPresumably this is because they are using a delayed job that scans periodically to see if any new badges need to be awarded. I see this approach also advised herebr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3162446howtoimplementbadgeshttpstackoverflow.comquestions3162446howtoimplementbadgesap  pHowever, I dont really see why this should be necessary, and am favoring in my implementation to simply have a system where after a relevant action is performed, for example a new comment is posted, a checkAwardBadge function is called, which checks if the user meets the criteria for a new comment badge.p  pSpeedwise, I was thinking that all relevant user stats would simply be stashed in a submodel of User, like UserStats so that instead of having to count the number of comments each time, it would just be a simple query.p  pIt strikes me that the system Im favoring should be fast and very simple to understand. Are there downsides Im missing here on why its necessary to complicate things with delayed jobsp  pTo clarify I plan to have an abstract class Achievements, with each actual Achievement an implementation of Achievements. Each Achievement will have a checkAwardBadge function, which can be called from the controller, or even a delayed job if I should choose to go that route, or any time really, to check whether a user has earned a certain badge. Thus, achievement code would all be centralized.p
Negative 6557 pMy requirement is to create temp table then exec a store procedure which will insert rows into the temp table then drop the temp table. However if there is an error when doing this, I want to always drop the temp table at the end.

Negative 6557 pI have a 60GB edb file, and I want to break the database into individual emails. I do not have any of the original domain information, so I cant just fire up a Server 2k8 vm and reattach it there. I have made some progress with a naive approach of stripping binary data bytes not 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0d, and 0x20 through 0x7f from the file went from 60 to 30 GB, then split that at obvious SMTP headers. That approach does not seem to work because Exchange doesnt keep the entire email together in a contiguous block, and it seems to duplicate a lot of the email this is probably an artifact of treating the entire file as a filesystem, rather than doing something more sensible like letting the filesystem be a filesystem, and just storing the emails in varmail or the like.p  pSo, question is what tools and documents for the Exchange Database File Format are hidden in the world that Google cant or wont show mep

Negative 6557 pIm reading a book called JavaScript patterns but theres one part where I think the guy is confusing. p  pThe guy actually led up in the book to the klass design pattern, where he developed it piece by piece. He first he presents the problemp  precodefunction inheritC, P  C.prototype  P.prototype  codepre  pHe saysp  pThis gives you short and fast prototype chain lookups because all objects actually share the same prototype. But thats also a DRAWBACK because if one child or grandchild somewhere down the inheritance chain MODIFIES the prototype, it AFFECTS all parents and grandparents.p  pHowever, I actually tried to modify the prototype say in Child and it had no affect on Parent and in fact Child still pointed to Parent and completely ignored its own prototype of same name, which makes sense since its pointing to a different memory position. So how can the guy says something like that Below proves my pointp  precodefunction Parent  Parent.prototype.say  function   return 20   function Child   Child.prototype.say  function   return 10   inheritChild, Parent  function inheritC, P  C.prototype  P.prototype      var parent  new Parent var child  new Child   var child2  new Child alertchild.say 20 alertparent.say 20 alertchild2.say 20 codepre  pIts impossible for any child or grandchild to modify the prototypep  pThis leads to my second point. He says the solution to the problem of the possibility of accidentially modifying parent prototypes down inheritance chain which I cant reproduce is to break the direct link between parents and childs prototype while at the same time benefiting from the prototype chain. He offers the following as a solutionp  precodefunction inheritC, P  var F  function   F.prototype  P.prototype C.prototype  new F  codepre  pThe problem is this outputs the same exact values as the other patternp  precodefunction Parent  Parent.prototype.say  function   return 20   function Child    Child.prototype.say  function   return 10   inheritChild, Parent  function inheritC, P  var F  function   F.prototype  P.prototype C.prototype  new F   var parent  new Parent var child  new Child   var child2  new Child alertchild.say 20 alertparent.say 20 alertchild2.say 20 codepre  pIt doesnt make sense that an empty function somehow breaks a link. In fact, the Child points to F and F in turn points to the Parents prototype. So they are ALL still pointing to the same memory position.

Negative 6557 pI have my MVVM and the model consists of a number of related classes, but for the sake of this question well focus on just four.p  pGrandParentModel, ParentModel, ChildModel and Contact.p  pThese all inherit from ModelBase which has an implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged on it.p  pSo each of the three models has a Contact property. If Child doesnt have a property it is supposed to look to Parent, and if Parent is blank it will look to GrandParent. If the contact changes at the grandparent level Id like any dependants, ie any sub parents and their children to raise a PropertyChanged event for their Contact too. p  pI think everything Im going to do will be supported by the DependencyProperty system, but I dont want to use that as this is my Model, separation of concerns and all that.

My current model has a property on each which points at the parent null in the case of a grandparent and a parentgrandparent has a collection of child objects.p

It does not help p  pAfter uninstalling the plugin a save operation also results in Building Workspace... but that takes just a second.p  pIt must be possible to work with the plugin without this performance issue and still having Build automatically... enabled. Does anybody know howp  pThanks Klausp

Negative 6557 pI have a base class that captures some functionality common to two classes. In other words, I can create one base class and make these two classes subclasses of that base class. However, for each of these sub classes, the number of instances can be created is 1 i.e. each sub class has to be a singleton. I googled and found that theres a reasonable debate going on over this. Although there are several solutions available, I am not sure whether they would fit in my case.p  pcan anyone tell me how I should design thisp

There are a few modules that I am now having difficultly installing psycopg2 and mysqlpython.  The warning messages in homebrew constantly warn me about not having a 64bit version of Python on the path.  These warnings only add to my list of wanting to use a 64 bit version.  p  pAt the time I selected the 32bit install, the GUI for a particular project was the main focus.  Now the GUI has been come very simple and the database backend support using Django is much more important.  This being said, using the development version of wxPython 2.9 which supports OS X and 64bit 2.7 has become acceptable.p  pFor the nonmac users, to help explain why I had to use the 32bit version please see this a hrefhttpbatok.github.comvirtualenvwxp relnofollowBrief guide to using virtualenv in a wxpython projecta  p  pstrongSystem Informationstrongbr emDevelopment Systemembr emOSem Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.7br emPythonem 2.7.1 with virutalenv  virutalenvwrapperbr emProject Dependenciesembr Note that MySQL could be PostgresSQLs psycopg2 if I can get the postgresql to install with homebrew  p  blockquote   pDjango1.2.5br   MySQLpython1.2.3br   PIL1.1.7br   PyVISA1.3br   pyserial2.5br   virtualenv1.5.1br   virtualenvwrapper2.6.3br   wsgiref0.1.2br   wxPython2.8.11.0br   wxPythoncommon2.8.11.0  p blockquote  pemDeployment Systemembr emOSem Windows XP  Windows 7br emPythonem Hopefully none goal to use py2exe, or similar tool  p  pstrongCurrent Thoughtsstrongbr I fear that my goal cannot be accomplished based on the file paths alone.

Negative 6557 pSo, I took over an existing WinForms app recently.  We need to change it to something that runs in the system tray, but still pops up the form when a user wants to.  No problem.  As per this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions93989Mutex is being used to ensure only one copy of the app is runningap  pThe app has 3 main components the custom application context myContext which handles all the system stray stuff.  myContext creates an instance of a class called Gozer myGozer.  Gozer does all the real work.  It performs a series of operations on a timed interval check network status, if we have a connection it then does a few other things.  It also plays Global Thermonuclear War with itself for fun.  It lets everybody else know whats going on via a series of events.  When myForm is opened, myContext is passing myGozer in.p  pIts when I open myForm that I start bumping into all sorts of CrossThreading issues any time a control is used in some way.  Like manipulating myListView.  What Im not clear on is the best way to deal with this.  I know very little about threading.  I do not have a super large brain that can come to understand threading in 30 seconds.  And I dont have anyone around I can eat to absorb emtheirem superior knowledge of threading.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5868783solveacrossthreadingexceptioninwinformsthis questiona, I can simply check codesomeControl.InvokeRequiredcode and then invoke method in question via a delegate.  This works.  But now Im facing dropping a bunch of code in front of every time I need to deal with a control, which sets off some likely poorlycalibrated alarm bells in my head.  I also discovered a problem when exiting the application from the form this causes another CrossThreading exception back in myContext.  I am not sure its appropriate to exit the app from myForm any longer, but what other crossthreading madness is awaiting me at this time  I feel like Im setting myself up for a lot of sideeffect induced headaches.p  pI guess Im really worried about creating a bunch of potential issues down the road.  Or being asked to expand Gozers capabilities and then creating further issues when that requires work in myForm.  Or finding that opening and closing myForm while running creates a bunch of additional crossthreading issues.  Or that the app will cause everything to explode.p  pIs there something else I should be considering or missingp  pNote this is for a .net 2.0 app, so Jethros solution will not work here.  That said, since its not emthatem many places I have to write InvokeRequired logic, Im just going to do that.  Im pretty sure Im going to get to upgrade this to .net 3.5 in the next year and the suggested class below is how Ill be handling he issue.  Im marking it as the answer as a result.p

Negative 6557 pIve got a lot of code thats driving me really crazy right now. Im working with OpenGL, building a GUI framework which utilizes several different types of objects. I have Image classes which load .png files and store image information in the form of a GLuint texture reference. I have Panel and Button classes with pointers to the image classes they should be displaying. I have a Hud class with stdvectors of Panel and Button pointers. Finally, I have an Engine class that contains one Hud class, all my Button and Panel classes, and Image pointers. When the constructor is run, each of the Image pointers is initialized usingp  precodeimgMy  new Image codepre  pOnce all the images have been initialized, I run my load functionsp  precodeimgMygtloadImageimgMy.png codepre  pOf course, I delete the Images when I close the program.p  pMy problem is that some of the images are getting crossed. I have about thirty images right now, and a couple of the buttons are apparently pointing to the wrong images. I have checked my code thoroughly, and it appears to be solid. I believe this is a memory bug since the buttons which display the incorrect images are inconsistent. Sometimes they display the correct images, sometimes different buttons are displaying the wrong images. I wish I could show my code here, but its pretty massive.p  pThe reason Im using Image pointers in my Engine class instead of actual Image objects is that Im afraid of the Buttons pointing to invalid memory if the Engine class is resized, or its memory rearranged. I suspect theres a much better approach to what Im trying to accomplish, and Id appreciate any advice along those lines.p

Negative 6557 pIm not sure its only the last line, but we have an app that has a TextView with fillparent width, wrapcontent height.  Text is being put in there dynamically from the Java code.  The last line of the text simply isnt showing up, even though theres plenty of space in the layout.  Its inside of a fairly deep view hierarchy, so my guess is the measure logic in there is getting messed up, but its pretty frustrating.  We need to guess how many lines are going to be in the text and set androidlines accordingly to get it to work.p  pAnybody seen this  In the code, see id contentTextView towards the bottom.

Negative 6557 pI am having an issue with a string manipulation method I have written. The purpose of this method is to seek out link tags within a long string, and reformat their hrefs.p  pTo give some context, I am parsing a large number of HTML files that were on a CD and collating the results in to xml files that are on a website in a separate project I wrote this as part of a console app. The html files contain instructional text and this contains links that are relative to the files on the CD, and I need to change the hrefs to be relative to the website the information is going on.p  pThe following code appears to work just fine if there is only one link tag, but pass it two, and the output is very messed up. Strangely, Visual Studios Regex editor claims that the linkTag regex below is only matching the link tags, but when it comes round to replacing the links with the correct hrefs, it inserts link fragments at various points within the instructions string.p  pThe reason for the additional regexs alphaDir is that I will eventually expand this method to correct links with different starting hrefs. We are talking about parsing thousands of html files, but this format is the most common by far.p  pI am at a bit of a loss on this one as I am very much a regex beginner, and wrote all of the regexs below myself, so any thoughts on any of these would be great too.p  h3Typical Input stringh3  precodeHold 1st ltstronggtlta href..ffisthand.htmlgtFISTltagtltstronggt hand, back outward   ampamp fingers forward, and put 2nd ltstronggtlta href..ffisthand.htmlgtFISTltagtltstronggt hand, back forward   ampamp fingers inward, with lower knuckle of its 4th finger on   lower knuckle of 1st thumb then slide 2nd hand forwards one   hands length. codepre  h3The Methodh3  precodestatic string instructionsstring instructions              Regex Spaces  new Regexsnr         Regex linkTag  new Regexlta.gt.ltagt         Regex linkTagHtml  new Regexlta.gtltagt         Regex hrefAttr  new Regexhref.

I have two users admin and restricted user lets say Johnny. From admin account, I run installer, I choose For all users option and installation is completed successfully. Double click on desktop shortcut to my app and it starts normally. Then, I open regedit and grant access in full readwritemodify mode to HKLM registry to Johnny. The same thing with installation folder. After all that, I simply delete the installer msi file.p  pI log into the Johnny account and double click desktop shortcut and installer runs And it ends with error ofcourse, because it cannot find installer file which I previously deleted. Strange thing to me is, that if I double click on an applications exe file in Program Files, my app starts normally without that installer thing.  Ive also noticed, that InstallState file is being left after installation process, but deleting it has no effect.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is to have a situation, that after successful installation from admin account Johnny may run the app without any installer actions made by system before first run.p  pCan You please point me into the right direction Thanks in advance, Piotrekp

Negative 6557 pstrongUpdatestrong I have decided to go a different route with my problem. Instead of trying to reuse the same strongUIViewControllerstrong directly, I use two vanilla strongUIViewControllersstrong that are set as strongrootViewControllersstrong. In their strongloadViewstrong methods, they make a call to code[storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier]code to get the former strongUIViewControllerstrong and set their views to the controllers view. This is probably the preferred approach anyway, since I need to set several variables and delegates.p  pI have a strongUIStoryBoardstrong with a strongUITabBarControllerstrong as the entry point connected with two strongUINavigationControllersstrong. Each of those share a common strongUIViewControllerstrong as their root view controller. When the app starts, the first strongUITabBarItemstrong is selected and the view loads asexpected. However, when I select the second strongUITabBarItemstrong, the same view is not visible. I see the strongUINavigationBarstrong with a black background. Am I doing something incorrect with the Storyboard interface, or do I need to manually instantiate the strongUIViewControllerstrong via each strongUINavigationControllersstrong methodloadView for instancep

Negative 6557 pThis is driving me crazy.  I have an extension which we use to alter the Content Response of a request if there is an error. Basically, if everything works it gets serialized to JSON as normal, but if we get an unhandled exception, we serialize based on a different object.p  pWe need unit tests around this but I cannot figure out how to write them. The means to validate that it worked revolves around the StatusCode, the fault Message instance, and the ContentType of the response.p  pTo modify the Response going back, I utilize the WebOperationContext static class. I have seen examples of mocking this, but it seems like I have to hard code special logic that would then begin to percolate into the actual code, which I dont want.p  pWhat are some of the best ways to unit test a WCF behavior extensionp

Negative 6557 pHow can I create a sublist of class instances satisfying some condition on their attribute values, starting from the complete list of class instancesp  pFor example, I have a list of instances of my class Person. These persons have many attributes, among which ID, a unique identifier, and HHID, the identifier of the household they live in. I want to connect all the persons living in the same household, and therefore having the same HHID. By connect, I mean creating an edge between all the household members, using codenetworkxcode. In order to do this, I need to identify these persons and put them in a sublist, in order to be processed by some algorithm to connect them all together. How can I achieve thisp  pI need also a general tool to do this for other more complex purposes e.g. randomly connect N persons aged from 15 to 20 year, but in the easiest case of household members, I can use the fact that my list is ordered by ID and HHID, therefore I have something likep  precodeID HHID 0  0 1  0 2  0 3  1 4  1 5  2 codepre  pwhere the first household is composed of persons [0,1,2], the second of persons [3,4] and so on...p  pFor this household problem I have tried using the codepairwisecode iterator recipe a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryitertools.html relnofollowitertools documentationa in this wayp  precodeimport pairwise i  pairwisepersonList for p in personList     toConnectList  [p]     p1,p2  i.next     while p1.hhid  p2hhid         toConnectList.appendp2         p1,p2  i.next          connect all persons in toConnectList codepre  pBut obviously this doesnt work, as my iterator codeicode goes down until codehhidcode of the two adjacent persons dont match, and restarts from there for the next person. E.g. for the persons in the above example, my iterator will start to compare persons 2 and 3 when it comes to person 1 in the codeforcode loop, while I would need some way to jump directly to person 3 in the for loop and have my iterator start comparing person 3 and 4. I hope this example clarifies a bit, even if it doesnt look very clear...p  pMore generally, I need a way of creating a sublist of persons satisfying some conditions on their attribute values, possibly an efficient way I have around 150000 personsp

Negative 6557 pI am working on a mobile application that uses an api built with ASP.NET web api framework. We decided to use ACS alongside a custm STS as a mechanism to secure the api.

Negative 6557 pInside every aggregate the consistence must be guaranteed. It is easy to do it in the repository because I can always use transactions from the database or framework. I have doubts about what happens outside the repository. A service might need to work with more than one aggregate to process a request. There could be problems during the processing in the service or while the aggregates are persisted.p  pIf something goes wrong during the processing in the service I could raise an exception. That way the operation will be atomic. This is my first concern. Is that a good practice The problem I see is that it will be hard to recover from that. There will be no easy way to leave all the aggregates with the state they had before the failed operation.p  pThe other problem I have is what happens if one of the aggregates fails to be persisted. How do I ensure the consistency of the information Do I have to use database transactions outside the repositories I was thinking that it might not be the best solution because I should not be thinking in the database when I am designing the domain model.p

Negative 6557 pI have a report created in VS2008 on SQL Server 2008 SP3. The report comprises of several sub reports nested 3 or 4 levels down in some instances. Document Maps are used extensively so that Word Tables of Contents can be generated further down the line.p  pNow heres the problem.p  pIf I render to screen either in the development environment or rendered the deployed report from the reporting services server, then everything is OK. If I export the report in any format tested with Word, PDF amp Excel then the output is as expected.p  pHowever, if I create a URL including all the parameters something likep  precodehttpMYSERVERNAMEReportServerPagesReportViewer.aspx2fMYPATH2fMYREPORTNAMEampPARAM1999ampPARAM2999ampPARAM3999amprsCommandRenderamprsFormatHTML4.0 codepre  pthen paste this into an IE window, the output is incorrect. Well let me clarify that.p  pIf I render as above using the HTML4.0 rendering extension then the report renders on screen as expected, all the content is shown. If I render to Word by changing the rsFormat parameter to Word then the report renders but the first page is missing see note about this content below If I render to PDF, the same part of the report is missing. If I render to Excel, the document map generated on the first workbook sheet shows an entry for the missing section of report but clicking the click gives and invalid reference error and indeed that part of the report is again not rendered.p  pNote that the master report for want of a better term is made up of 3 subreports, each of these contain other sub reports.p  pIts the content of the first subreport, that also happens to only every show on the first page as it is just less than a page long that is missing. In Word there is something rendered but it looks like an empty table with a width that is the full width of the page but a heigh of just a few millimetres.p  pIm really at a loss as to why the section does not render when it works perfectly if rendered to screen and then exported. I had assumed they would use the same rendering process but Im not sure.p  pIll continue to experiment, maybe add some blank content before the problem section or something and see where I get but Im puzzled as to why this happens, other reports do not suffer the problem however I have only tested 3 or 4 or the hundreds that I have written. Ive not used the URL method much in the past but I got to this point as I was writing a c application to run the same report with varying parameters to produce over 1200 word documents, each of which takes about 2 mins to run. the output was incorrect there so I worked my way back to creating a manual URL and the problem was still apparent, the rest is historyp

Negative 6557 pSo Im building a Unix minishell in C, and am implementing input, output, and err redirection, and have come across a problem with files. I open my files in a loop where I find redirection operators, and use open, which returns an fd. I then assign the childs fd accordingly, and call an execute function.p  pWhen my shell is just going out and finding programs, and executing them with execvp, I dont have much of a problem. The only problem is knowing whether or not I need to call close on the file descriptors before prompting for the next command line. Im worried about having an fd leak, but dont exactly understand how it works.p  pMy real problem arises when using builtin commands. I have a builtin command called read, that takes one argument, an environmental variable namecould be one that doesnt yet exist. Read then prompts for a value, and assigns that value to the variable. Heres an examplep  precode read TESTVAR test value test value test value  echo  TESTVAR test value test value test value codepre  pWell lets say that I try something like thisp  precode echo heres another test value gt f1  read TESTVAR lt f1  echo  TESTVAR heres another test value codepre  pThis works great, keep in mind that read executes inside the parent process, I dont call read with execvp since its builtin. Read uses gets, which requires a stream variable, not an fd. So after poking around on the irc forums a bit I was told to use fdopen, to get the stream from the file descriptor. So before calling gets, I callp  precoderdStream  fdopeninFD, r codepre  pthen callp  precodeiffgetsbuffer, envValLen, rdStream  buffer       ifinFD fcloserdStream     return 1  ifinFD fcloserdStream codepre  pAs you can see, at the moment Im closing the stream with fclose, unless it is equal to stdinwhich is 0. Is this necessary Do I need to close the stream Or just the file descriptor Or both Im quite confused on which I should close, since they both refer to the same file, in a different manner. At the moment Im not closing the fd, however I think that I definitely should. I would just like somebody to help make sure my shell isnt leaking any files, as I want it to be able to execute several thousand commands in a single session without leaking memory.p  pThanks, if you guys want me to post anymore code just ask.p

Negative 6557 pI use the Three.js library to load and display objects from a single daeCollada scene file. The file is loaded using the ColladaLoader example code from Three.js and I then find the individual objects using the function codecolladaScene.getChildByNameObjectName, truecode.  This works great but I get moir artifacts when rendering.p  pSince the arbitrary loaded scenes contains complex objects edited in Blender, I cannot make any assumptions about the objects or any textures. I.e. I cannot hard code specific changesfixes to any textures or materials since I dont know what textures or materials to expect. The fixes or tweaks must be generic so that it can be applied to different objects with multiple textures. The textures dimensions cannot be assumed to conform to powers of 2 since we are not able to instruct the people creating the scene files.p  pThe problem I get really bad moir issues on several objects when displaying them using WebGL. Among the objects are several that has a striped texture dark wood and black and also brick walls in different colors. These striped and brick objects suffer from severe moir artifacts when rendered in various angles and distances. Here is an example of a striped object. This is a box geometry with a striped texture. a hrefhttpimgur.comavKsi30 relnofollowhttpimgur.comavKsi30ap  pIs it possible to change the settings of the texturematerials or the textures themselves to make the moir artifacts disappear Can I change the filter settings, the shader settings or create mipmap textures Is the moir caused by the textures dimensions not conforming to the power of 2 rule of thumb How can we create create antialiased mipmaps in Javascript after loading the Collada scene Can we somehow make Blender create the mipmaps I havent been able to get Blender to export mipmaps in Collada format. I have triend checkingunchecking the Automatic mipmaps on the object textures in Blender but to no avail.p  pPlease help me. Is it an issue of the filter, the shader or mipmap Does anybody have example code of loading an Collada scene, then traversing the objects settingchanging the objects to render smoothly even at odd angles and distancesp  pAs a last resort, if nothing can be done through Javascript in Three.js Is there any way that we can open the scenes in Blender and change the materialtexture settings to make the objects render better when exported to a Collada filep  pWhen I display the striped object when it has been loaded into Three.js it looks like I have included everything I even remotly imagine have any effect on the renderingp  precodeTHREE.Mesh     children Array[0]  No child objects.     material THREE.MeshPhongMaterial         blendDst 205         blendEquation 100         blendSrc 204         blending 1         map THREE.Texture             anisotropy 1             format 1021             generateMipmaps true             image ltimggt                 height 474                 width 1395             magFilter 1006             mapping THREE.UVMapping             minFilter 1006             mipmaps Array[0]             premultiplyAlpha false             type 1009             metal false             morphNormals false             morphTargets false             normalMap null             opacity 1             shading 2             skinning false codepre

I though I had managed to get everything to work as I would expected, but after distributing the program to a few people I know, I began encountering problems. Ill try to keep this as short as possible. Thanks for staying with me.p  pIll start with the first of the two problems in my title. On my machine AMD Phenom II 965 and Nvidia GTX 480 the final product of my renderer was exactly as expected. I was going to post a link to an image, but seeing as I am a new user, I was unable to post more than 3 hyperlinks. But it is sufficient to say, it looked like it should have.p  pThis is exactly what I intended so I though the renderer was working fine. I sent it off to a friend who was using a GT 440 and they had the same results. p  pSoon after this I gave a build of the engine to a friend of mine who has a laptop with a GT 540M. This was what the renderer produced ignore the FPS counter, it doesnt workp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comDxxFEpy.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comDxxFEpy.pngap  pObviously this is not at all the results I expected. I experienced the same results on every other mobile graphics card I was able to test on. After more than a week of banging my head on my desk, I was able to narrow the problem down to the lighting pass, where glBlendFunc is called. My code is as follows p  precode    glBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, 0     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT     ListltFloat[]gt[] listArray  LightData.getInstance.updateLights     ListltFloat[]gt lightsColor  listArray[1]     ListltFloat[]gt lightsPos  listArray[0]     viewMatrix.setViewMatrixcamera.getTranslation, camera.getRotation       glDisableGLDEPTHTEST     glUseProgram0     glCallListquadList     FBO.useShader     FBO.passTextures Just sets the shader uniform values to the correct textures     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT     glEnableGLBLEND     glLoadIdentity     glBlendFuncGLONE, GLONE  using GLONE and GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA have the same effect     for int i  0 i lt lightsPos.size i          glClearGLDEPTHBUFFERBIT         int uniformLightPosition  glGetUniformLocationFBO.getShaderID, uniformLightPosition         int uniformLightColor  glGetUniformLocationFBO.getShaderID, uniformLightColor         int uniformViewMatrix  glGetUniformLocationFBO.getShaderID, uniformViewMatrix         int uniformAmbient  glGetUniformLocationFBO.getShaderID, uniformAmbient         glUniform1uniformLightPosition, Tools.asFloatBufferlightsPos.geti         glUniform1uniformLightColor, Tools.asFloatBufferlightsColor.geti         glUniform1funiformAmbient, 0.01f         glUniformMatrix4uniformViewMatrix, true, viewMatrix.asFloatBuffer          glCallListquadList is just a display list for a fullscreen quad using GLQUADS           glDisableGLBLEND     glEnableGLDEPTHTEST codepre  pThis first thing that you might notice is the fact that I draw a quad and then clear the depth and color buffers. That will be a addressed in my next question, although I wouldnt be surprised if the problem in my next question was closely related to the one in this question. I am almost sure 99 that the problem is in this method because when testing with an older build of the engine that only supported one light but was still using the deferred pipeline I was able to get perfect results on every computer I tested on. Once again, the renderer works on every desktop graphics card I have tested, but not on any laptop graphics cards. I have ruled out almost everything except this method. It might be worth noting that I have had no success using a texture with an internal format that is not codeGLRGBA32fcode or codeGLRGBA16fcode as a render target. Has anyone seen this before, or can anyone offer assistance I would love if anyone even had any idea where to start looking for problems at this point, because Ive got nothing. Ive been complete unable to find a solution by myself.p  pThen moving on to the second problem and second question. In the beginning of the last code block I had a few line of codes that created a quad on the screen with no shaderp  precodeglDisableGLDEPTHTEST     glUseProgram0     glCallListquadList     FBO.useShader     FBO.passTextures Just sets the shader uniform values to the correct textures     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT     glEnableGLBLEND codepre  pAs far as I can tell, this code should do absolutely nothing. But when I remove the drawing of the quad, The window displays thisp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.commkMsP0F.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.commkMsP0F.pngap  pI didnt know what else to call this besides ghosting because it is like a ghost image at least that how it seems to me. When I rotate the MV matrix it distorts in the direction I rotate, and the first set of lights I use an array of 7 light it, but then the rest light the actual model. I cant explain why this happens because the code that generates this image is exactly like the code above without the codeglCallListquadListcode which means the depth and color buffers are still cleared right before I enter the loop. I cant explain this problem at all. Does anyone have any idea whats wrong and how to fix it, or at least an idea about whats wrong p  pstrongEDITstrong I have found that this only happens to models that have texture coordinates. I dont know why.p  pstrongEDITstrong It looks like when I limit the amount of lights allowed in each shader to 1, the ghosting gets much less noticeable, but is still there, So I assume this means that one run of the fragment shader results in these ghosts.p  pThanks for ANY help anyone has with either of these two problems, it is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions for me just ask, although it might take me some time to get back to you, Ill try to get back as fast as possible.p  pstrongEDITstrong Sory, I forgot my shader code GeometryPass vertexp  precodeuniform sampler2D tex  varying vec3 surfaceNormal varying vec3 varyingVertex  void main      vec4 color  vec4texture2Dtex, glTexCoord[1].st     glFragColor  color   codepre  pGeometryPass fragmentp  precodeuniform sampler2D tex  varying vec3 surfaceNormal varying vec3 varyingVertex  uniform float materialValue uniform float specValue   void main      vec4 color  vec4texture2Dtex, glTexCoord[1].st vec40.25,0.25,0.25,1     vec4 vertex  vec4varyingVertex, materialValue     vec4 normal  vec4surfaceNormal, specValue     glFragData[0]  color     glFragData[1]  vertex     glFragData[2]  normal   codepre  pLightPass Phong vertexp  precodevoid main      glTexCoord[0]  glMultiTexCoord0     glPosition  glModelViewMatrix  glVertex  codepre  pLightPass Phong Fragmentp  precodeuniform sampler2D location uniform sampler2D normal uniform sampler2D color  uniform float uniformLightPosition[21] uniform mat4 uniformViewMatrix uniform float uniformLightColor[28]   void main      vec4 color  texture2Dcolor, glTexCoord[0].st     vec4 locationAndMat  texture2Dlocation, glTexCoord[0].st     vec4 normalAndSpec  texture2Dnormal, glTexCoord[0].st        vec3 vertexPosition  locationAndMat.xyz     vec3 surfaceNormal  normalAndSpec.xyz     float spec  normalAndSpec.a     float specA  locationAndMat.a      vec4 lightColor[7]     int iterator  0     for int i  0 ilt28 i  i4          lightColor[iterator]  vec4uniformLightColor[i], uniformLightColor[i1], uniformLightColor[i2], uniformLightColor[i3]         iterator  iterator  1          vec3 lightPos[7]     iterator  0     for int i  0 ilt21 i  i3          lightPos[iterator]  vec3uniformLightPosition[i], uniformLightPosition[i1], uniformLightPosition[i2]         lightPos[iterator]   uniformViewMatrix  vec4lightPos[iterator],1.xyz          iterator  iterator  1           vec4 fragData[7]     vec4 endColor     for int i  0 ilt7  i          if lightColor[i]  vec40,0,0,0 ampamp color  vec40,0,0,0              vec3 lightDistance  lightPos[i]vertexPosition             float distance  powpowlightDistance.x, 2  powlightDistance.y, 2  powlightDistance.z, 2, 0.5             if distance lt lightColor[i].a                   float att  13800lightColor[i].a  0.225powdistance, 2                 vec3 lightDirection  normalizelightDistance                      float diffuseLightIntensity  max0.0, dotsurfaceNormal, lightDirection                 fragData[i]  vec4diffuseLightIntensity,diffuseLightIntensity,diffuseLightIntensity,1                      vec3 reflectionDirection  normalizereflectlightDirection, surfaceNormal                  float specular  max0.0, dotreflectionDirection,  normalizevertexPosition                  if diffuseLightIntensity  0                      float fspecular  powspecular, spec                     vec4 fspec  vec4fspecularspecA, fspecularspecA, fspecularspecA,1                     fragData[i]  fspec                                  fragData[i]  lightColor[i]                  fragData[i]  0.1                 fragData[i].a  0                 fragData[i]  att                 endColor  fragData[i]                                     glFragData[0]  endColor  color   codepre

Negative 6557 pI have been using Azure Websites for couple of months and I decided to migrate to Cloud Services for SSL reasons. Since, I might need couple of web roles in my project, my session management need to be stateless. p  pThis is how I deal with user data in my project. If I need user related data I get their username via codeHttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Namecode. Using this info I query my database to fetch information about my users.p  pIs this to correct way to do it  I made some research but could not find really clear info about where codeHttpContext.Current.Usercode comes from.p  pSo far, this is what I understand. User authenticates with Forms Authentication which creates a cookie in users PC. When server is requested by user again, server checks the cookie info and uses it to fill HttpContext object. If one of the other web roles takes the request next time, could it use that cookie to fill HttpContext  this could be all wrong, as I said this is what I understand from docs and other answers on webp  pThat is what I am trying to understand basically. I hope I explained my problem clear enough. Let me know If it is not clear.p

Negative 6557 pSo I have a website that uses Bcrypt security on the registrationlogin.  It generates the random salt  password hash and stores it in the database.  We are now working on a desktop client that will require the user to login.  We will probably create some kind of REST API on the webserver itself to interact with this desktop application.  I have a few questions.  p  pOne being how should we be sending requests to the server from the client  I assume the saltpass hash should never leave the REST API, as sending that information to the user could be dangerous.  So how would we safely log in a user  Should we simply send the password over a POST request to the REST APIp  pSecond, should we be requiring some hardcoded API key inside the client to prevent people from connecting to REST API without using the client  How can we go about protecting this client applicationAPI.p  pNot really sure where to look, so I thought I would have someone help point me in the right direction here.  Thanks and happy to provide additional information.p

Negative 6557 pOk, admittedly this is my first experience with java script and jQuery. Im trying to display a codeltpgt ltpgtcode tag, fade it out, then fade in another. The fade out part works just fine but afterwards the other tags dont show up. You can see the border of the container changing size to accommodate the larger text area but you cant see the text. Lines 2223 are where the text should fade in. Ive looked at the jQuery docs but cant seem to find a reason for it. Ive tried putting the code.csscode calls in the front of the expression but the all I get is the text popping up instead of fading in. I got the idea from a source on the net and tried to change it to accommodate my needs. I ended up rewriting the whole thing as you see it now.

Negative 6557 pAfter a while away from Chef I am currently getting back to it for all my server needs. I already used it a few years back for a while and got to like it, but had other people do the ops part lately.p  pBut I am still struggling to find a really good starting setup local VagrantChef to go with for development. Using Vagrant by itself is a breeze, super easy to use and reasonably quick to develop the server setup on top of it. But once I have to leave Vagrant for the actual deployment it gets annoying again. I cant always use a Vagrant box, but Rackspace or even an actual hardware box somewhere sometimes.p  pRight now I do it as followsp  pDevelop against Vagrant, trying to have as few actual config in the Vagrantfile as possiblep  ul liusing mostly roles, with predefined default attributes for my usual environmentsli lionly specifying node specific attributes in the Vagrantfileli lirunning the vagrant provisioning with manually snapshots directly from VirtualBox in between steps to avoid rebuilding from scratch all the timeli ul  pStage and actually deploy the serverp  pUsing Rackspace Cloud staging at least with Knife Solop  ul licreating Rackspace Servers from the WebInterface to have consistent first provisioning step via rooip with password for all serversli liadd publickey auth to the server so the pw is not needed anymoreli liadd a local node configuration for the new server copying what is defined in the Vagrantfileli liuse knife solo preparebootstrap the serverli ul  pThis is already not so bad but still has a few glitches that are sometimes quite annoyingp  ul limanual snapshots from VirtualBox for Vagrant i did not find any working plugin yetli liredundancy between node config and Vagrantfile probably have the Vagrantfile parse a node config and use the values that wayli liinconsistent bootstrapping between Vagrant and Knife Solo probably using a common script for both if I figure out how to add it to Vagrant 1li ul  pIn addition to that I had to sadly find out that the chefrecipes have widely grown into quite a jungle of incompatible and opinionated artefacts. Its sometimes quite hard to even get a basic setup with the default recipes working. I am a little surprised that a lot of the basics are hardly coveredp  pGetting the combination of sshdiptables to work took me a day of research and then still modifying the default templates to get it to work  while I expected it to be the starting point for almost any server. Also there does not seem to be any default chefuser workflow. Everything I found so far either runs as root or needs quite a bit modification. And last but not least chef on ubuntu 12.04 still uses ruby 1.8.7 which is reaching its end of live in just a few months.p  pIt might be that I just did not find the right ressources to cover all the points I am currently still struggling with or satisfied with but still it seems there are quite a lot ways to improve it.p  pstrongSo how does vagrant  chef work in a real environment beyond just the local virtual box work for you and what pitfalls are there to watch out forstrongp  pIt seems that it starts insanely awesome having all that automated bootstrapping through vagrant locally but once you go beyond that things get really messy. Id be glad if people also using some kind of setup like this could give me some pointers of how to tackle the above mentioned issues. I dont mind putting in some effort to get it all running as i expect it to be but maybe i already walked down the wrong part and just make it all harder on myself that in actually needs to be p  pFor now the short summary is VagrandChefSolo KnifeSolo is quite awesome, but to work properly the whole bootstrapping part needs to we switched out with a custom one to get a proper System base before applying cookbooks  and those needs to be carefully picked out of the jungle.p  pProgessUpdate Notesp  p1 Just figured out, purely by luck when giving it a shot, that apparently it is possible to add more than one provisionmechanism in one Vagrantfilep  precodeconfig.vm.provision shell, path bootstrap.ubuntu12.04.2serveramd64.sh   config.vm.provision chefsolo do chef     ...   end codepre  pSince the shell one is executed first I can use it as a custom preperation for Vagrant servers while still using ChefSolo for the actual Setup. Yay. Still will have to see how useful this will be at the end but a bit missing step works now to have the processes aligned.p

Negative 6557 pWe have some elements characterized by some key value.p  pWe consider the elements in descending order of key values. So, if we have ten elements with key values, 4, 5, 7, 10, 2, 8, 9, 10, 8.5, 9, we sort the elements by their key values, and consider the elements with equal key values together. p  pAs such, elements with equal key values, e.g. 10, will be considered together, followed by elements with key values 9, and so on. When an element is considered, and it passes a certain fitness function, it is removed from the list and is not considered any more. p  pNow we relax the restriction of having equal key values to be considered together a little, and consider the elements with approximately equal key values together. So, when we say that in a sorted order the second element is within 10 of the first one, they are to be considered together.p  pSo, now elements with key values 10, 10, 9, 9 are to be considered together. And provided, one element with  key value 9 is not removed here, it will have to be considered again with 8.5.p  pThe only way I can think of implementing the above scenario is something like this,p  ol liSort the elements in descending order of key values.li liFor the first element in the order, find 10 as allowable deviation. Find elements which fall within this deviation window. So, here we consider, 10, 10, 9, 9, in this window. li liIf any of the elements passes the fitness function, remove it from the list.li liForm the next window and repeat the cycle.li ol  pThis is where my idea gets boggled. How do I form the start form the start of next window If the sorted values are 10, 10, 9, 9, 8.5, 8 ..., and 10, 10, 9, 9, have been considered in the first window,  the next window should start with 9 and consist of 9, 8,5. p  pIs it always sufficient to start the next window the last value of previous window I tried some counterexamples and none of them invalidated my conjecture. But what if both the 9s pass the fitness function and get removed from the list, which value start the next window The next one available in the sorted listp  pSo, my questions are,p  ol liIs the conjecture regarding starting the next window with the last value and next one available in the if it gets removed of previous window correctli liIs there a better algorithm for the whole processli ol

Instead, didSelectRowAtIndexPath is use to update a label in the detailviewcontroller as belowp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      DetailViewController detailViewController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierDetailViewController]     NSMutableString object  thisArray[indexPath.row]      detailViewController.passedData  object     [self.navigationController pushViewControllerdetailViewController animatedYES]  codepre  pEverything till this point works fine.p  pNow i have added another view controller in my storyboard. Made it the initial view controller, added two containers in it, then embedded both MasterViewController and DetailViewContainer in these containers.p  pNow instead of showing passed data inside the DetailViewController on the right side, its showing the passed data on the left side by replacing the controller view.p  pIf i am not able to clarify what i am trying to say, here is the link to the project a hrefhttpsjumpshare.comvUiTFEB6AamIo8qX9sinW relnofollowhttpsjumpshare.comvUiTFEB6AamIo8qX9sinWa , its just for learning purpose.p  pThanksp

Negative 6557 pIm planning to use JavaDB Derby or PostgreSQL.p  pI have the following problem I need to store a large set of vectors. Currently all vectors contain a fixed number of elements. Hence the appropriate way of storing the set is using one row per vector and a column per element. However, the number of elements might change over time. Additionally, in my case, from a software engineering perspective, having a fixed number of columns reflects knowledge about a software component which the general model should be unaware of.p  pTherefore Im thinking about linearizing the layout and use a general table that stores elements instead of vectors.p  pThe first element of the vector 5 could then be queried like thisp  pcodeSELECT value FROM elements where vid  5 and eid  1codep  pIn general, I do not need full table reads, and only a relatively small subset of the vectors is accessed.p  pMaybe databasesavvy people can judge what the performance impact will bep  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 6557 pI have worked on this a for a while and googled everything related I can think of. p  pI have a button in my app that toggles rotation.

Negative 6557 pIm currently torturing myself with an implementation conundrum. I have a structure akin to a simple Post  Comments nested resource relationship.p  pI have the facility for showing context specific comments articles1comments but also want to be able to have a page for seeing all comments regardless of the article context. Mainly for summary purposes.p  pWhen I coderake routescode I have codearticlesidcommentscode and codecommentscode both mapping to codecommentsindexcodep  pSo my question is, do I put logic in place in the index method in the Comments Controller to handle the two different data sets Ill need contextual and non contextual or should I modify the routes to have two different methods in the controller for the two different view optionsp  pIs this still RESTful to do thisp  pI should probably just try it and see but I want to learn this right so I thought Id ask.

Negative 6557 pIm in the frustrating situation of having an intermittent error.  When functional, PHP specifies a video and 3 pictures to be displayed.  The video begins playing 800ms after the page loads, and the pictures are displayed immediately upon the end of the video, at which point a user presses a key corresponding to the location of the picture and the keypress triggers a function that measures reaction time, stores which picture they selected, and loads the next page, whereupon all of this happens again with a new video and new pictures. p  pThat all works just fine... sometimes. p  pAt other times, I get a blank screen where I was expecting to see the video.  Sometimes it happens right away, sometimes after as many as 15 or 20 successful loads, or anywhere in between.  Im running Chrome 27.0.1453.93, and tracking errors using Chromes builtin javascript console.  Even when the video fails to load, there are no javascript errors with DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01EN.  p  pTo pinpoint where things are breaking down, Ive added a bunch of event listeners and used anonymous functions to pass some output to the js console log file to see which stages of the video event are or arent happening.  Here, at least, is a reliable pattern every time the video fails to load, loadstart has happened, but durationchange has not. I just cant figure out what the problem is that prevents it from continuingp  pI look forward to the responses here, whether theyre answers or even just other people corroborating the experience so I dont feel so crazy  Ill include the two most relevant javascript functions here, but Im not sure how much good theyll do.p  precodeltscriptgt      function playVidnewSource             console.logplayVid worked            setTimeoutfunctiontells it to wait for some amount of time below before doing the next part                console.logsetTimeout was called                document.getElementByIdStimClip.innerHTMLltvideo idvideo1gt ltsource src  newSource   typevideomp4gtSomething went wrong.

Negative 6557 pIm using a library called ExcelWriterXML in PHP to create excel files.p  pThey are created in format .xls and I myself doesnt have any problem opening them.p  pUnfortunately, my customers do. When they try to open the file they get an error saying that the file is corrupt.p  pI have tried to change the code so it creates a file with .xlsx format instead, but then the file doesnt work for me. Im supposed to have the latest excel reader so shouldnt be a problem with my software I cant seem to understand what the problem is, so now I turn to youp  pAny ideas what may be causing the problemp  pThank you for all the helpp
Negative 6557 pIm trying to create an Android app whose home screen has three buttons. Im using the program Eclipse and it automatically gives the buttons a horizontal linear layout.

Negative 6557 pI defined a a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagenumericpreludeNumericPreludea codeRingcode instance for my own data type, but failed to define codeonecode or codefromIntegercode. When I compiled the program, I got no warnings because the codeRingcode class has default emmutually recursiveem implementations for codeonecode and codefromIntegercode. The result a stack overflow that was very difficult to find. Indeed, when using XRebindableSyntax, the codefromIntegercode on numeric constants need not be explicit, so it was quite difficult to figure out codefromIntegercode was the culprit of the stack overflow.p  pIs there a way for developers to annotate classes to indicate a minimal complete definition It would be very helpful if GHC could throw a warning for instances which do not meet this definition, while allowing a complete set of default implementations. If not, what is the accepted practice here Should developers leave the a minimal set of methods without defaults so that the appropriate warnings are thrown, or do we rely on users to RTFMp

Before this change, both repos were identical. The change was a revert some images from a previous commit taking them from original state to the correct state, but I dont think the fact that it was a revert matters.

Negative 6557 pIm building a play web app that connects to Google Drive. Going through the Google OAuth 2.0 process, when a user logs in I save the accesstoken to Cache and I save the refreshtoken along with other user data to database and cache. Google OAuth accessTokens only last for a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2WebServer relnofollow1 houra, and likewise the accessToken in my cache expires in an hour.p  pSo, following, Ive created an Authenticated function along the lines of a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.xScalaActionsComposition relnofollowAnother way to create an Authenticated actiona, except that in addition to the user, I also store the accessToken.p  pHowever, the accessToken expires after an hour, and if it has expired, then I need to do a web service GET request to google with my refreshtoken in order to retrieve another accesstoken.p  pIve managed to create a synchronous version that seems a bit ugly, but works. I was wondering if perhaps theres a way to rework it to be synchronousp  precodedef Authenticated[A]p BodyParser[A]f AuthenticatedRequest[A] gt Result     Actionp  request gt     val result1  for        userId lt request.session.getusername       user lt Cache.getAs[User]suseruserId       token lt Cache.getAs[String]accessTokenKeyuserId      yield fAuthenticatedRequestuser, token, request      import scala.concurrent.duration.     lazy val result2  for        userId lt request.session.getusername       user lt Cache.getAs[User]suseruserId       token lt persistAccessTokenAwait.resultrequestNewAccessTokenuser.refreshTokenuserId, 10.secondsuserId      yield fAuthenticatedRequestuser, token, request      result1.getOrElseresult2.getOrElseResults.Redirectroutes.Application.index     codepre  pcoderequestNewAccessTokencode makes a WS post request to Google, sending the refreshToken along with other stuff, and in return google sends back a new Access Token, heres the methodp  precodedef refreshTokenBodyrefreshToken String  Map   refreshtoken gt SeqrefreshToken,   clientid gt SeqclientId,   clientsecret gt SeqclientSecret,   granttype gt SeqtokenGrantType   def requestNewAccessTokenrefreshToken Stringimplicit userId String Future[Response]    WS.urltokenUri.withHeaderstokenHeader.postrefreshTokenBodyrefreshToken codepre  pIt seems the only other way to convert a Future[ws.Response] to a ws.Response is to use onComplete, but that is a callback function with a return type of Unit, which doesnt seem to sit well with the example provided in the Playframework docs above, and I dont see how I can convert the AsyncResult back to a response without redirecting it to a second router. Another possibility that Ive thought of is a filter that intercepts requests, and if the accessToken in Cache has expired, to just get another one from Google and save it to the Cache before the Action method starts that way, the accessToken will always be current.p  pAs I said, the synchronous version works, and if thats the only way to implement this procedure, then so be it, but I was hoping there might be a way to do this asynchronously.p  pthank you so muchp  h2UPDATE FOR Play 2.2.0h2  pcodeasync code is deprecated for Play 2.2.0 and will be removed in Play 2.3. So the solution listed above will needs to be revised if you are using the current version of Play.p  pAs a reminder, of the logic, when a user successfully logs in, an Google accesstoken is persisted to the Cache. The accesstoken only lasts for an hour, so we remove the accesstoken from the Cache after an hour.p  pSo, the logic of codeAuthenticatedcode is that it checks to see there is a userId cookie in the request. Then it uses that userId to fetch the matching codeUsercode from the cache. The codeUsercode contains a coderefreshtokencode in case the current codeaccesstokencode has expired. If there is no codeuserIdcode cookie in the cache or we cannot retrieve the matching codeusercode from Cache, then we start a new session and redirect to the application landing page.p  pIf the user is successfully retrieved from cache, then we try to get the codeaccesstokencode from the Cache. If it is there, then we create a codeWrappedRequestcode object that contains the coderequestcode, codeusercode, and codeaccesstokencode. If it isnt in the Cache, then we make a web service call to Google obtain a new codeaccesstokencode, which is persisted to cache and then passed to the codeWrappedRequestcodep  pTo make an asynchronous request using codeAuthenticatedcode, we simply add code.applycode the same as for an codeActioncode, like sop  precodedef testing123  Authenticated.async    Future.successful  Oktesting 123   codepre  pAnd here is the updated trait, which works for Play 2.2.0p  precodeimport controllers.routes import models.User  import play.api.cache.Cache import play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.Implicits.defaultContext import play.api.mvc. import play.api.Play.current import scala.concurrent.Future  trait Authenticate extends GoogleOAuth      case class AuthenticatedRequest[A]user User, accessToken String, request Request[A]     extends WrappedRequest[A]request    val startOver Future[SimpleResult]  Future      Results.Redirectroutes.Application.index.withNewSession       object Authenticated extends ActionBuilder[AuthenticatedRequest]      def invokeBlock[A]request Request[A],                    block AuthenticatedRequest[A] gt Future[SimpleResult]         request.session.getuserName.map  implicit userId gt         Cache.getAs[User]userKey.map  user gt           Cache.getAs[String]accessTokenKey.map  accessToken gt             blockAuthenticatedRequestuser, accessToken, request           .getOrElse   users accessToken has expired, so do WS call to Google for another one             requestNewAccessTokenuser.token.flatMap  response gt               persistAccessTokenresponse.map  accessToken gt                 blockAuthenticatedRequestuser, accessToken, request               .getOrElsestartOver                                 .getOrElsestartOver  user not found in Cache       .getOrElsestartOver  userName not found in session          codepre

Negative 6557 pEverything I know about vector projection so far is from the internet so I am a little confused. First of all I assume when we project the vertices of a polygon on to an axis, we get the scalar projection as opposed to the vector projection. And the formula for this is A.B  A, now in a hrefhttpwww.codezealot.orgarchives55satproj relnofollowthis tutoriala, they simply use the dot product to project on to the axis. Is this because the vector and the axis are perpendicular or something Nonetheless I had a go at writing a crude version in C, but it doesnt seem to return correct resultsp  precode    Rectangle r1  new Rectangle300, 200, 50, 50     Rectangle r2  new Rectangle340, 240, 50, 50      bool areCollidingRectangle r1, Rectangle r2               Using clockwise labelling                               B                  .    .                .       .

Negative 6557 pMy apologies for such a stupid question in advance I thought that we need to divide data set to training and testing in svm and then using training set in order to find the model. Then check the accuracy of this model using testing set.  In libsvm dataset a hrefhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvmtoolsdatasetsmulticlass.html relnofollowhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvmtoolsdatasetsmulticlass.htmla some data sets have the training and the testing and the others do not have the training and the testing therefore according to the libsvm guide in libsvm website, the ralated codes are different. For example in svmguide2 dataset there is not specified  testing set. So how we can test the accuracy of model. p

Negative 6557 pMany R users eventually figure out lots of ways to remove elements from their data. One way is to use codeNULLcode, particularly when you want to do something like drop a column from a codedata.framecode or drop an element from a codelistcode.p  pEventually, a user comes across a situation where they want to drop several columns from a codedata.framecode at once, and they hit upon codelt listNULLcode as the solution since using codelt NULLcode will result in an error.p  pA codedata.framecode emisem a special type of codelistcode, so it wouldnt be too tough to imagine that the approaches for removing items from a codelistcode should be the same as removing columns from a codedata.framecode.

Negative 6557 pI want to implement a class which stores different appearances for different controls. At first I thought to use generics, as suchp  precodepublic class AppearanceltT where T  Controlgt  ...  codepre  pbut there are two problems. First of all, I want to use these appearances in a list for different controls, namely different T impossible in this case. Secondly each control types appearance will have different properties according to the control it is refering.

Negative 6557 pI mean, interpreters work on a list of instructions, which seem to be composed more or less by sequences of bytes, usually stored as integers. Opcodes are retrieved from these integers, by doing bitwise operations, for use in a big switch statement where all operations are located.p  pMy specific question is strongHow do the object values get storedretrievedstrongp  pFor example, lets nonrealistically assume p  ol liOur instructions are unsigned 32 bit integers.li liWeve reserved the first 4 bits of the integer for opcodes.li ol  pIf I wanted to store data in the same integer as my opcode, Im limited to a 24 bit integer. If I wanted to store it in the next instruction, Im limited to a 32 bit value.p  pValues like Strings require lots more storage than this. How do most interpreters get away with this in an efficient mannerp
Negative 6557 pI need to get the users location say at a restaurant. The user has his phonedevice which is connected to the internet using 3G wifi is turned on but no internet is available since the restaurant doesnt provide free wifi. The device may or may not have a sim card if its a phone sim card is present, but if its a tablet like galaxy tab with 3G then only 3G is available.p  pI am thinking of using the codeNETWORKPROVIDERcode. It seems to work perfectly with wifi, but I was wondering if it would work with only 3G. I do not completely understand how codeNETWORKPROVIDERcode works. It uses the wifi hotspots or cellular triangulation, so I assume it MUST be connected to that wifi In a restaurant he might have near by wifi but not connected to it, so I can only rely upon 3G.p  pThe code I have used at the momentp  precodelocationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER, 0, 0, locationListener codepre  pWill the provide me accurate location with 3Gp  pstrongEDITstrong What is the estimated accuracy of codeNETWORKPROVIDERcodep

Negative 6557 pI have a very basic codeJPanelcode that is set inside its own codeJFramecode.p  pThe codeJPanel implements actionlistenercode and codeoverrides paintcomponentcode.p  pI have a bunch of stuff drawn in the paintcomponent method, just shapes and polygons, most is fixed but theres 2 components that rotate. This is done by a timer. The timer is a codeSwing Timercodep  pBy fixed I mean theres no variables that can affect its location.p  pThe class has a codeStartTimer StartTheCountdowncode method that starts a timer. On each timer tick the action that is performed is that it increments an angle by a fixed number and then it calls for the window to be repainted.  This is to rotate the couple of components that are not fixed. which I have left in the code for you to seep  pThe problem im having is that if you resize the window it causes the timer to lag and thus the rotation doesnt happen in the right amount of time. When you stop resizing its goes back to normal.p  pIf you just do a quick single drag and resize its not noticeable, however just for testing if I click and hold and drag furiously all over the screen for some seconds when I let go its noticeably lagged, almost as if its come to a halt and only continues when I let go.p  pIve read about using different threads for drawing and performing certain tasks, SwingWorker But Im not too sure how to use it in my case.p  pAny tips on how to prevent this lagp  pEDIT I have added new code that is ready to compile and run AS IS.p  pIf you leave it to run the arrow stops at the bottom after 30 seconds. If you resize the window continuously for a second or so, the timer lags so after 30 seconds it hasnt reached the bottom yet.

Negative 6557 pRight, first off let me give some context. Hopefully my explanation isnt too confusing.p  pIm using a face detection algorithm, which returns a rectangle representing the faces bounds within a live video stream. This returns a rectangle once per frame if there was a face detected.p  pIn any case, what Im trying to do is get a rectangle that represents the average area within which the face in question has been moving. I keep a list of these rectangles from which Im attempting to calculate the said average.p  pIve attempted to calculate a simple average rectangle by averaging all x,y,widths and heights, but the resulting rectangle from this method gets gradually worse the longer the face stays more or less in the same place.p  pMy latest attempt was to get a rectangle from the list of centerpoints for each face, but this is badly skewed when a single face position is near the edge of the image.p  pAnyway, what Im hoping to get by posting here is maybe suggestions for an algorithm that already exists that might be able to help with this issue. Ive been trying to look up weighted averages but Im not entirely sure what to look for. Any help would be much appreciated.p  pWhat a set of rectangles usually looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgiPaX.png altp  pWhat Id like to get the green rectanglep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL2VeW.png altp

Negative 6557 pI am trying to setup a simple PHP login script that redirects after successful login.

Negative 6557 pSo My Question is I want to know how to delete the accounts pointer array so that I can fill the array back in with the contents of my dummyA array.

Upon research, my best guess is that my problem is that Im deleting my array more than once but I dont know how..Essentially,my accounts array of pointers to new objects has an irrelevant object in the middle of the array, soooo I made a dummy to place all relevant objects into with the goal of erasing all objects in accounts then replacing the objects with the objects inside of dummy,I want to save memory and try to be efficient..

Negative 6557 pI have a Rails app that searches a static set of documents, and I need to figure out the best way to cache result sets.  I cant just use the native ActiveRecord caching.p  pstrongMy situationstrongp  pIm using the willpaginate gem, and at the moment, the query is running every time the user changes pages.  Some queries are too complex for this to be responsive, so I need to cache the results, at least during an individual session.  Also, the user may have multiple tabs open, running separate queries simultaneously.  The document set is static the size of the set is on the order of tens of thousands of documents.p  pstrongWhy straightforward ActiveRecord caching wont workstrongp  pThe user can search the contents of the documents, or search based on metadata restrictions like a date range, or both.  The metadata for each document is stored in an ActiveRecord, so those criteria are applied with an ActiveRecord query.p  pBut if they add a search term for the document content, I run that search using a separate FastCGI application, because Im doing some specialized search logic.  So, I pass the term amp the winnoweddown document list to the FastCGI application, which responds with the final result list.  Then I do another ActiveRecord query whereid IN ,returnedIdsp  pBy the way, its these FastCGI searches that are sometimes complex enough to be unresponsive.p  pstrongMy thoughtsstrongp  pTheres the obvioustoanewbie approach I can use the metadata restrictions plus the search term as a key theyre already stored in a hash.  Theyd be paired up with the returnedIds array.  And a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgcachingwithrails.htmlcachestores relnofollowthis guide at RubyOnRails.orga mentions the cache stores that are available.  But its not clear to me which store is best, and Im also assuming theres a gem thats better for this.p  pI found the gem memcached, but its not clear to me whether it would work for caching the results of my FastCGI request.p

Negative 6557 pMy graph contains nodes called points and lines. p  pThere is a relationship type called NEXT, which connects two points and has a property called codelineIDcode a long. A line node consists simply of an ID and a reference to a root point. To traverse a line is to start with its root node and follow the NEXT relationships whose codelineIDcode matches the id of the line being traversed. To clarify, if were traversing a line with ID 123, whose root point has id 321, the Cypher traversal would be p  precode START n  node321   MATCH n[relNEXTlineID123]gtx   RETURN collectrel codepre  pA line, then, is essentially a linked list of Next relationships with matching codelineIDcode properties. That said, I dont want to persist this list as a property of lines  I want the list to be constructed by a traversal when a line is loaded. p  pWhat are my options for implementing this in springdataneo4j Specifically, should lines exist as codeNodeEntitycodes, and if so what should they contain p  precodeNodeEntity class Line      RelatedTotypeROOT     Point root     RelatedToViatypeNEXT      IterableltItemgt list codepre  pdoesnt quite fit, because the emlineem is not related via Next relationships to the item, the root point is. It also fails to address the fact that those NEXT relationships need to have a lineID property matching the lines ID which becomes important because some points exist on multiple lines  i.e. they have multiple NEXT relationships with different lineIDs. I have a hunch that the solution will involve annotating the list as a GraphTraversal, but I dont understand how that would work. p  pIm doing this largely as an exercise to wrap my head around data modeling in SDN, in the context of wrapping my head around Neo4j and graph databases in general. If the question Im asking reveals a flaw in my understanding of any of these things, Id be very appreciative if someone could point it out. p

However, the first verify fails because Moq believes it was called twice while the second verify fails as not called.p  pIt appears that the properties of the Person object parameter that is used in both Save calls are not preserved at the point of method invocation. Instead it appears to be just holding a reference to the Person parameter and checking its properties after all invocations.p  pIs there a way to get round this The only thing I can think of is to take copies of object properties in multiple Setup.Callbacks replacing the Debug.Print statements. However, it would be nicer not to have .Setups at all as the Save method has nothing to return.p

Negative 6557 pIs there a way for a user in localhostadmin to great a new class automatically, rather than by having to add the code manuallyp  pFor example, lets say I have an app the tracks the statistics of players on a baseball team, and have defined a class for the statistics of the players on the team. If I want the user to be able to create a new table to house statistics of players on a different team with the exact same Fields as the previous team, is there a way for the user to do this in localhostadminp

Negative 6557 pIm working on a very simple utility using CakePHP 2.4.6 and PHP 5.4.16 a full breakdown of my environment is below. The database is a legacy MS SQL database hosted on AWS.  I was able to get everything involving PDO configured in such a way that the app is connecting to the database successfully and both pulling and updating records.p  pMy main controller presents a view to the user containing relevant records pulled from the database.  Each record has a simple associated form with a single checkbox that allows the user to update that record.  When the user ticks the checkbox, I use ajax to make a call to a method on a emseparateem controller, which updates that record in the db and returns the result. p  pHeres the problem Im running into If I tick a bunch of boxes in quick succession, everything works fineall of the records are updated successfully.  However, if I pause between ticking boxes 10 seconds, or so emevery other update failsem with codenetERRCONNECTIONRESETcode. Nothing is recorded in codeerror.logcode.  So I tick one box, ajax fires, record is updated pause tick another box, ajax fires, controller returns an error pause tick another box, ajax fires, record is updated, etc.  p  pI confirmed that the error is related to the app trying to connect to the database, as everything works fine if I remove all database operations from the controller method and just return some arbitrary value to the ajax call.  My uneducated guess is that Im running into some sort of problem with duplicateparallel connections to the database.  Thus whenever a duplicate connection is attempted, the connection is reset, which means that the next time a connection is attempted the connection is successful, and so on.  I havent posted any code because Im really not sure where to begin trying to fix this.  As far as I can tell everything is working in my code I dont know if this is a problem with the CakePHP framework itself, or my database configuration, or PDOs driver setup, or something else Im missing.

I am trying to build the Vim text editor from source code to install on the 32bit machine to a place I have access, like CVim.p  pNow, I have successfully built both a 64bit and 32bit version of Vim on my 64bit computer. Both of them run fine on the 64bit computer. I can verify with dumpbin.exe as detailed a hrefhttpblogs.technet.combwindowshpcarchive20090327howtotellifaexefileisa32bitor64bitapplicationusingdumpbin.aspx relnofollowherea that the 32bit build really actually is a 32bit build. Doing version within Vim while running the 32bit build also confirms this.p  pBut when I try running that same executable on the 32bit machine, I see strongThis version of gvim.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows youre running. Check you computers system information to see whether you need a x86 32bit or x64 64bit version of the program, and then contact the software publisherstrong. For kicks, I tried the 64bit build of Vim and got the same message. I tried setting compatibility mode on the executable before running it, but get the same result. Additionally, only Windows Server 2008 and a few version of Windows Vista appear in the list of compatibility modes I was going to try Windows XP but it does not appear in the list.p  pNow, when I download an installer from cream.sf.net instead of trying to build my own Vim, Vim installs fine and then launches fine. I can see the full list I originally expected in the compatibility mode list of the installed executable. So I must be doing something wrong when I build.p  pThe only difference I can think of, is that Im compiling on a 64bit machine, and using Visual Studio 2010 rather than Cygwin to build. But it is very strange that neither the 32bit nor the 64bit build works I would always expect at least one of them to work What could I be doing wrongp

However, the metadata remains unchanged, so the Orientation information is still correct i.e. 0,1,2, or 3p  pHowever, once added to the iPhone Simulator, the images are corrected and the Orientation is always 0.p  pThis means that these statements work on the iPhone correctly returns 03 but not on the Simulator always returns 0p  precodeUIImage imageinfo[UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage] NSLogoriginal orientationli,image.imageOrientation codepre  pSo, here is my question finallyp  pHow can I add photos to the Simulator and maintain the correct, and necessary, metadata so that I can test without having to use my iPhonep

Negative 6557 pIn the GFS paper, Section 4.1 describes how GFS is able to make concurrent mutations within a directory while only requiring a read lock on the directory for each client  theres no actual inode in GFS, so clients are free to create, remove, or mutate codexysomefilecode while only requiring a read lock on codexcode and codexycode.p  pIf there are no inodes, then is it still possible to maintain an explicit tree structure The only way I can see this working is if the master maintains a flattened, 1dimensional mapping from directory or file names to their metadata, allowing for fast file creation and manipulation.p  pSuppose that some client of GFS wanted to scan the names of all files in a directory  for instance, codelscode. Without an iteration over all metadata nodes, how is this possiblep  pIt might be possible for a client to maintain their own version of what they think the directory tree looks like in the GFS, but this will only work if each client keeps to their own directory.p

The HTML is like thisp  precode    ltform actionmypage.aspxgt     ltaspDropDownList runatserver ViewStateModeEnabled IDdrpItems AutoPostBackTrue CssClassformcontrol                             OnSelectedIndexChangeddrpItemsSelectedIndexChangedgt                             ltaspListItem TextItem1 Value1 gt                             ltaspListItem Value2gtItem2ltaspListItemgt                         ltaspDropDownListgt     ltformgt       ltdiv idsubscriptionModal classmodal fade subscriptionPopupWrapper tabindex1 ariahiddentrue datareplacetrue datafocusoninputfirstgt         ltdiv classmodaldialoggt             ltdiv classmodalcontent idsubscriptionModalContentgt                 ltform actionpopup.aspxgt                   Popup page content loaded dynamically                  ltformgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pThe form inside strongsubscriptionModalContentstrong div is loaded remotely and shown as a modal. When this modal form is closed and as soon as the strongdrpItemsstrong is changed the auto postback event fires and posts the page appending a url of popup.aspx instead of posting the page to mypage.aspx.p  pCan anyone help me to resolve this issue Any suggestions or help is highly appreciated.p

Negative 6557 pWe are in the process of migrating media items images, PDFs, etc from an old system into Sitecore. Some of the directories in the old system have multiple media items with the same name but different extensions. So if I had to get them via URL they would be as follows p  ul lihttpexample.comimagestest.gifli lihttpexample.comimagestest.jpgli ul  pThey can obviously be reached in the old file based system because their file extensions differ. In Sitecore, out of the box, this is not the case. Multiple items that live under the same node with the same name cannot be reached by adding extensions in front of them. Only the first media item would be hit regardless of the extensions.p  pIs there a way to get around this Can Sitecore differentiate between different media items with the same name but different extensions under the same node so that the above 2 URLs would work and point to the respective imagesp  pThanksp

Negative 6557 pIm using Grails 2.4.1 to build a Grails plugin project via Jenkins amp the Grails Release plugin 3.0.1 to publish that plugin to our Nexus repository.p  pThe user that runs Jetbrains jetbrains on our build server already has a .m2settings.xml file. That file defines some Mirrors that are causing havok when trying to publish plugins to our nexus repository.

Negative 6557 pIm creating an android application which is supposed to run on multiple different devices with notably different physical screensizes. The recommended way to do this seems to be the discrimination of screensizes via the devices dpwidth, eg creating a layoutw700dpfolder for the corresponding devices.p  pI tested my application on a Samsung galaxy Note 2 5.5 and a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini 4.3. They both display the layout differently due to the available space and thus need different layout files.p  pHeres the Problem They both report a dpwidth of 640. The Note has a dpfactor of 2 with a pixelwidth of 1280, the S4 mini has a dpfactor of 1.5 with a width of 960px. How can I use different layout files for the devices Theres indubitably quite a huge difference in physical size and I quite honestly wonder for which reason the Device Independent measurement reports the same width for each device.p  pIs there any other way to use different layoutfiles per devicep  pEdit I cant provide images of the application due to internal restrictions, but essentially I need to use different backgrounds for my buttons due to the fact that wrapcontent takes the backgroundsize in pixels into account, thus making them bigger on the S4 mini due to the lower density. If I dont, the buttons are too big on the S4 and overlap.p  pThanks in advancep

The id for the codeUsercode is a standardrails incrementing integer.p  pThe codestatscode table has a codeuseridcode column that can contain either the codeUsercode id or the codeDemoUsercode id.

Negative 6557 pIm doing a mixed number calculator for my c class. We are to store everything in a custom mixed number class with whole number, numerator and denominator. Because of this, irrational answers have to be approximated before converting to mixed numbers. My problem is if I square the output of 212, it would return a mixed number that is really close to 2 but not 2 exactly. I want to know is there a way to make a1nn return a for all positive as. TIA.p

Negative 6557 pI have a scenario in Drools. I have some set of rules.  For Example  p  pIn Rule 1 I am setting ProductName in the fact pojo that comes from session after some condition. In Rule 2 I am calculating grade value i.e. X1,X2,X3,X4. So for each grade I have single rule to calculate.p  pThe Fact pojo that is coming from User may ask to calculate any grade value. However, say user asked for X4, then all the grade value from X1 to X3 should also be calculated. p  pWhat I did is that whenever any rule is executed in then condition I am updating a fact  that is holding a grade value property and in the last one single rule is written that will check for matching of the grade that is incoming from Pojo and executed rule grade.p  pHowever, it is not stopping on the particuler  grade and executing all the grade value.p  pPlease suggest some way.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pRule Calculate X  when seq  true  then     calculate Xp  pRule Calculate x1  when seq  true  then     calculate X1 Rule Calculate x2  when seq  true  then     calculate X2p  pSay if I asked to calculate X2, then rule x and x1 should also be calculated.  If x1 then rule x and x1 should only execute. p  pThanks Kumar Shoravp

Negative 6557 pAfter reading a hrefhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201301innerclasshandlermemoryleak.html relnofollowthis articlea, I started thinking about memory leaks with Volley. Usually, the listeners implemented with Volley have either an implicit or explicit reference to the outer class the activity. for examplep  precodeJsonObjectRequest jsonObjReq  new JsonObjectRequestRequest.Method.GET,         url, null,          new Response.ListenerltJSONObjectgt              Override              public void onResponseJSONObject response                   updateLayout                         codepre  pin this case there is an implicit reference... or I may want to create a custom JsonObjectRequest to internalize the response handling, and need to pass in a reference to the calling activity in its constructor. p  pNow lets say I start a web request, but before the response comes back, I navigate away from the activity that started the request. From what I understand the JsonObjectRequest object would keep a reference to my activity and prevent it from being Garbage collected.  brAm I understanding this correctly, is this a legitimate fear brDoes the Volley library automatically deal with this brIf am creating a custom JsonObjectRequest and passing in a this reference to activity, do I need to create a WeakReference to the activityp
Negative 6557 pIm using VS 2008 at the moment for my development ASP.NET C.p  pCurrently Im facing some problem with GridViewp  pI bind data to the GridView DataSource using a DataSet query from database, I then have a checkbox which allow user to hide or display the column using the following method p  precode    if chkPhone.Checked  true  strSQL  , recruitwebsite as Website  codepre  pOkay now the problem I facing is that, how do I make this specific column rows to wrap with anchor tag So that user can go to the respective website directly though the GridView.p  pSo the first approach I use was to use the RowDataBound event and do something like p  precode    e.Row.Cells[7].Text  lta href  e.Row.Cells[7].Text  gtClick Meltagt codepre  pBut then the problem comes, IF the user choose not to display this column, the column index will be different. There are more options for user to hide the column so 1 in index doesnt make sensep  pWell so this approach fails, I tried using another approach which is using the DataRowView in the RowDataBound event p  precode    if e.Row.RowType  DataControlRowType.DataRow              DataRowView rowView  DataRowViewe.Row.DataItem          rowView[Website]  something something to deal with here      codepre  pUsing this method I can get the value from the GridView using the column name, but I cant set the value.p  pSo whats the best solution for this situationp

Negative 6557 pI doubt that this is possible, but heres hoping...p  pWhen the user flicks between pages of apps on their home screen, when a page with my widget comes into view, Id like this event to trigger displaying a message in my widget within a TextView, so that the message appears for a couple of seconds and then disappears a bit like a Toast.p  pIs it possible to detect and react to such an event  Failing that, maybe the next best thing would be to detect a screen on event.  Not as good because there is no guarantee that my widget will be on the home screen page when the display is turned on, so the message may have disappeared by the time the user flicks across to the page where my widget resides.p

Negative 6557 pI should notify, that this question is very specific.br Many of you knows how to deal with dynamic terrains kinda falling through terrain when updating terrains collision mesh,  a hrefhttphub.jmonkeyengine.orgforumtopiccollisiononacustomdynamicmesh relnofollowhttphub.jmonkeyengine.orgforumtopiccollisiononacustomdynamicmesha  just translating character up using heightmap or smth, but i have more specific staff my dynamic object isnt terrain. Its a spaceship that actually obeys actually all of physics laws.br Every chunk is rigidbody and collision mesh dynamically created by iterating through chunk data adding custom meshes to it. So.. ok. Actual problem begins while i want to add a block when ive added block and collision mesh been updated, i can fly through LAST CREATED ONLY its important block until i place new one. Debug view shows me that all is ok and mesh updated, but really i aint trustim. D And if i place new one while im being in bounds of old one  i still could fly through it... So this kinda strange and theres much code. If its only my problem  ill try to lay out code... So... Waiting for ur responses...p  pUPD If characters bounding volume not colliding with whole chunks bounding volume  all is ok. Thats much more helpful i think...p  pUPD I dont want to recreate whole rigidbody cause that affects nothing but instancing new objects, so i just doing so codecollisionShape  CollisionShapeFactory.createDynamicMeshShapespatialcode on needed physics update.

Negative 6557 pIm implementing a Chess game Chinese Chess, aka. Xiangqi, to be exact in Erlang.p  pA piece is represented by a codeColor, Typecode tuple, and a point ie. location is represented by a codeFile, Rankcode tuple. The board is represented by a pointtopiece map ie. codepoint gt piececode.p  pThere is a function to query whether a particular point on the board is occupied by a piece or notp  precodeispointoccupiedsimpleBoard, Point gt     ensureispointPoint,     case mapsfindPoint, Board of         ok,  gt             true         error gt             false     end. codepre  pHowever, I would like to add an optional parameter to check the color of the piece  if the point is occupied by a piece of the specified color, the function returns true otherwise it returns false. If I dont care about the color of the piece, I can just put codecode in the codeTargetColorcode parameter or, equivalently, invoke codeispointoccupied2codep  precodeispointoccupiedBoard, Point gt     ispointoccupiedBoard, Point, .  ispointoccupiedBoard, Point,  gt     ensureispointPoint,     case mapsfindPoint, Board of         ok,  gt             true         error gt             false     end  ispointoccupiedBoard, Point, TargetColor gt     ensureispointPoint,     ensureiscolorTargetColor,     case mapsfindPoint, Board of         ok, TargetColor,  gt             true         ok,  gt             false         error gt             false     end. codepre  pI dont like the above implementation because of the large proportion of copyandpaste, so I simplified the above function like thisp  precodeispointoccupied2Board, Point gt     ispointoccupied2Board, Point, .  ispointoccupied2Board, Point, TargetColor gt     ensureispointPoint,     ensureiscolororwildcardTargetColor,     case mapsfindPoint, Board of         ok, TargetColor,  gt             true         ok,  gt             iswildcardTargetColor         error gt             false     end. codepre  pThe function codeiswildcard1code is simply a onelinerp  precodeiswildcardWildcard gt Wildcard  . codepre  pNow, I would like to go further to replace codeTargetColorcode by codeTargetPiececode, which is a codeTargetColor, TargetTypecode tuple. None, one or both of the tuple elements may be a wildcard codecode. I found it difficult to write the codecasecode clauses. I also notice that to match an ntuple allowing dont care in this way, there needs 2supnsup clauses. So obviously it is not the proper way to implement this.p  pDoes anyone have better ideasp  pPS I didnt include the source of all functions since those I didnt include are trivial to implement in my opinion.

That neatly explains why the stack trace is pointing to cucumber thats the thread thats waiting to write out to STDOUT, from the formatter. But we dont have any info on who closed the file descriptor.p  pSince I know Im dealing with threads here, I start to a hrefhttpblog.headius.com200802rubythreadraisethreadkilltimeoutrb.htmlsuspect timeouta is killing something when it shouldnt be, but I have no way of knowing what codetimeoutcode is causing the mess I removed the one in my code but then found 35 in various gems were using, and the issue is still occurring.p  pWe also suspected, at some point, that one of the phantomjs processes was being killed due to low memory, and we added instrumentation to codeputscode the current process memory before every scenario and the codeIOErrorcodes went away, almost certainly because of timing issues. When I removed the instrumentation the errors returned.p  pIve also attempted to update to tipoftree cucumber and capybara, but neither seemed to make a difference.p  pIs there some clever way to track this down that Ive not yet tried Have you seen this issue and know the oneline configuration change I need to make it better Do you have a convenient patch that removes codetimeoutcode from all Ruby everywherep

Negative 6557 pWe have a number of dynamically generated printable forms files on our site that use iText 4.2.0.

Negative 6557 pWhen using Auto Layout in a storyboard theres an option to keep a constraint installed or not with an Installed checkbox. Disabling it will cause it to behave as if you didnt add that constraint  it will have no effect. You can configure the installed state for different size classes in Interface Builder, and you can change this value programmatically by setting its codeactivecode property to codetruecode or codefalsecode.p  pIn my app I want to have a constraint installed only while the device is in portrait  it should be uninstalled when rotating to landscape. This can be accomplished for iPhones by unchecking installed for Any Width Compact Height. Although this doesnt seem to work quite right because it breaks this constraint due to conflicting constraints when rotating to landscape when it shouldnt even be installed, but regardless the UI always appears as expected. But there is no way to uninstall the constraint for the iPad in landscape in Interface Builder its Regular Width Regular Height in both orientations.p  pstrongWhere is the proper place to enabledisable codeactivecode for codeNSLayoutConstraintcodes when rotating the devicestrong In what rotation method will changing that status result in the desired behavior  only be installed for portrait If that method isnt called upon app launch, in what other method should it be placed in addition to a rotation methodp  pIve tried placing the following code in codeviewDidLoadcode and codeviewWillTransitionToSizecode but this results in some unexpected behavior when running on iPadbrp  ul liLaunching the app in landscape causes the constraint to be active despite the fact active was set to false, it breaks the constraint, and the UI doesnt appear as expected li liLaunching the app in portrait sets active to true it was already installed in IB so it works as expectedli liLaunching the app in portrait and rotating the device to landscape works as expected  constraint is set to inactive, it doesnt break the constraint, UI appears as expectedli liLaunching the app in portrait, rotating to landscape, and back to portrait causes the UI to appear correct but it breaks this constraint that is set to activeli ul  pIf I uninstall the constraint in Interface Builder then run the above scenarios I get essentially the opposite behavior.p  precodeif size.width gt size.height      self.myConstraint.active  false  else      self.myConstraint.active  true  codepre

Negative 6557 pHello I just noticed one weird behaviour of softDelete. Basically, when I query for a related set of models, Eloquent returns a collection that also contains soft deleted rows.p  pI have been following the 4.2 guides on traits usage for softdelete and my code works just fine as long as I getdeleterestoreforce delete my models. The issue is triggered with relations.p  pConsider this scenario I have a user model that has a belongToMany friendship relation where the friendship status can be acceptedpendingrequestedblocked as followsp  precodepublic function friends       return thisgtbelongsToManyUser, friends, userid, friendidgtwherestatus, accepted  codepre  pThis friends table rows are basically vectors where user1statususer2 and viceversa user2statususer1 is on another row. When user1 decides not to be friend with user2 anymore, the 2 friends rows are softdeleted.p  pHere is the issue when I query the DB from the controller like thisp  precodefriends  usergtfriends codepre  peven the softdeleted rows show up in the returned collection even though I would have expected these to be hidden from results unless I used withTrashed.p  pI suspect the belongsToMany method doesnt take into account the deletedat field on the pivot table.p  pDid anyone faced a similar issue Am I doing something wrong with this relationp  pThanks a lot for your helpp

Negative 6557 pI often find myself in a situation where a class has an optional dependency.  For example, the codenotifiercode in the following.p  precodeclass Exampleobject     def initself, notifierNone         self.notifier  notifier or DummyNotifier      def doTheBusinessself         doSomeWork         self.notifier.notifyComplete codepre  pAs the codenotifiercode is optional, I have two choicesp  ul liIf no codenotifiercode is supplied, put a codeDummyNotifiercode in its place as per the example above, where codeDummyNotifiercode is an implementation of the dependency that performs no actionsli liIn codedoTheBusinesscode, check whether codenotifiercode is None before calling anything on itli ul  pI prefer the first option for code readability, but it involves having to write a implementation for each dependency albeit a very small one.p  pTo avoid this, Ive been thinking of a generic dependency as followsp  precodeclass GenericDependencyobject     def genericself, args, kwargs         pass     def getattrself,          return self.generic codepre  pI can then call any method on thisp  precodegd  GenericDependency gd.notifyComplete gd.anythingElsealso, works, with, anyarguments codepre  pThis obviously only works for actions  not functions that require a return value.p  pMy question  1 is this Pythonic 2 is there a better wayp

Negative 6557 pThere is already an excellent answer to this question posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6956409ssisreadingmultiplexmlfilesfromfolderPrevious Answera, and it almost works as advertised, but I have one problem. In the example the author creates a For Each File Enumerator and a loop variable to hold the XML file name. The value of this variable is left as an empty string.p  pI find that I must put a valid initial value in that variable. If I do not, I get this error Validation Error. Import XML Serialization File The property XMLDataVariable on the Read XML Serialization File was emptyp  pIf I put in a valid initial value, the package executes correctly. This is superfluous, but if I then put a new set of XML files in the folder to be imported without changing the initial value I get this error when I execute the package Package Validation Error. The file emtext specifying my particular file hereem was not found. Please verify the path and try again.p  pI suspect I have something set up incorrectly, but Im new to SSIS and Im not sure where to look. Thanks for any help.p

Negative 6557 pIm looking for a job and I have this company which they want to hire me, but they dont have real need for me at the moment. However, they gave me a task to do whichpersonally I guess is my backdoor to grab my seat at the company if I succeed in finding them the solution.p  pOkay lets get serious now.p  pThis company is developing ERP systems since quite sometime and everything is good.Except one issue they need to find a solution for.p  pWe know that when youthe ABC company purchase an ERP system for you tasks and projects activities.and your ERP system provider charges you per user of the system you purchase.Say you asked for a 10 users licence you got to pay 1000K and so on.some clients try to cheat the system by allowing it to run more than 10 users. I was told they set one PC and imitate a connection with the ERP system that count for one connected user and through that user account multiple concurrent users can remote access the ERP system and hence break the 10 users limit. The current solutions this company uses arep  phardware key thatp  ol licounts the number of connected users and stop accepting new connection after it reach the defined user limitli liprevent the system from being copied to servers other than the one where its been installed and configuredfor purpose of preventing software piracy. li ol  pOr p  psession is used to count the number of users.Where each session between the software on the server and the browser is counted as one connected user.Unfortunately, this not good solution as it leads to add new user for each established session,even the same user is operating these sessions. so it ends up forcing the user of your client to only open one session at a time,which is annoying for themI mean you sold a software but it is not your business to ask the user how many sessions he can operate at one time.p  pWhat Im looking for here is p  pHow can ERP developer limits and control the number of users accessing the system as theseusers numberbeing defined during the agreementto make sure only the client is not able to violates the limit defined earlier.p  pSolutions could be some hard coded rules or whatever other than the above mentioned ones.p  pP.S the ERP system under discussion is Oracle based from AZ, if that helps narrow the problem scope to get better solution p  pUPDATEp  pThe authentication here is in the browser prior to granting user access to use the system. And its normal username amp password combination.p  pThanks.p

Negative 6557 pI seem to have run across an issue with binding and I have looked everywhere to try to resolve it.  p  pI have a user control in ASP.NET that has a Channel ID public property which is a long.  I have added this user control to an empty ASPX page for testing.  When I simply add a number for this property value i.e. codeChannelID9code then it works perfectly.  When I try to do the followingp  precodeChannelIDlt ChannelID gt  codepre  pwhere codeChannelIDcode is a variable on the hosting ASPX page, it tells me it cannot convert from string to long as a compilation error.  p  pWhat I have gathered so far through my research is that the data binding functions convert values to strings rather than retaining their original data types.  p  pWhat I am trying to accomplish is to have multiple user controls in a single page that all bind a property through a shared interface to the same value of the host page.  I know that I could do this in code behind but that is what I am trying to avoid.  I also know that I could simply change the data type to string and then convert it before it is sent from the user control to the database....that will be the route I go if I cannot find another solution.p  pThere is not really code I can post because the scenario is extremely basic.But here is the declaration of the user code on the host pagep  precodeltUCChanControl IDChanControl1 runatserver IsActiveViewtrue     DisplayModeNormal ChannelIDlt ChannelIDgt gt  codepre  pAgain, the codeChannelIDcode property in the host page and the user control are both set to long.  p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 6557 pIm new to VB.Net, and I am curious about the use cases for extension methods.  Specifically, why would I use an extension method when I have inheritance and interfaces at my disposal  At first glance, extension methods dont seem to me like a very OO practice, and it seems like they would lead to less readable code as opposed to using subclasses andor interfaces to achieve the same purpose.  Is there something special about extension methods that Im missing  When do you use them p

Needless to say, this is undesired behavior.  I want one character from the user.

Negative 6557 pHow do you source the data of multiple objects from a text file in JavaScript Im creating a program that will work with employee data and each employee will be treated as an object I want the object data to come from an external source i.e. a text file or an Excel spreadsheet, instead of having to explicitly write out the data for each employee within the code of the program. The multiple employee objects will be pushed into an array and then Ill interact with them in various ways. In the code below, Ive had to explicitly write out employee data see below.

The following statement generates a hex       representation of an 8 byte salt.  Representing this in hex provides       no additional security, but makes it easier for humans to read.      salt  dechexmtrand0, 2147483647 . dechexmtrand0, 2147483647        This hashes the password with the salt so that it can be stored securely       in your database.  The output of this next statement is a 64 byte hex       string representing the 32 byte sha256 hash of the password.  The original       password cannot be recovered from the hash.      password  hashsha256, POST[password] . salt        Next we hash the hash value 65536 more times.  The purpose of this is to       protect against brute force attacks.  Now an attacker must compute the hash 65537       times for each guess they make against a password, whereas if the password       were hashed only once the attacker would have been able to make 65537 different        guesses in the same amount of time instead of only one.      forround  0 round lt 65536 round                password  hashsha256, password . salt              Here we prepare our tokens for insertion into the SQL query.

Negative 6557 pIve been to reading about NSURLSession and how to upload data in the background, but just cant figure it out. So I was hoping someone could help me.p  pI have an app that searches for a users location and sends data to a server, and that part is working fine. If the app is terminated for whatever reason, the app gets woken up again when it receives a location update. When the app is woken up, it has about 10 seconds to process any information before getting terminated again. With a very slow Internet connection it can sometimes take more than 10 seconds to contact the server and get a response. Thats why I was hoping to use some background mode in iOS to contact the server and get a response.p  pNow, I was looking into NSURLSession, but cant seem to get it working. I basically just need to send a JSON to the server and then get the servers response back.p  pI have been following a tutorial, but I keep getting this exceptionp  blockquote   pNSURLSessionUpload[451266325]  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSGenericException, reason Upload tasks from NSData are not supported in background sessions.p blockquote  pHeres the tutorial in case you want to check it out.p  pa hrefhttpsmedium.comswiftprogramminglearnnsurlsessionusingswiftpart3upload3a5be9a69950 relnofollowhttpsmedium.comswiftprogramminglearnnsurlsessionusingswiftpart3upload3a5be9a69950ap  pCould some post some sample code that I could look intop

Negative 6557 pThis is my first attempt at library assembly, so please have mercyp  pI am trying to link an external library written in .f90 and compiled with IVF on VS2012 to my Qt application 32bit based on Qt 5.5.0 MinGW 4.9.2.p  pI have a few questionsp  p1 Is this futile Some of the research I have found suggests that IVF and MinGW are ABI incompatible. I really want to stay with the MinGW compiler in Qt because basically everything else we are doing with the software uses this. p  p2 It would be of advantage to be able to load the library only when called upon which would only represent a fraction of cases. For this reason I have been attempting to use QLibrary but keep getting Segmentation faults when I try to call SUBROUTINES defined in my DLL with resolvemyfunctionp  pI have defined my external subroutine as just a simple test at this stage, not actually important for what I wanted to do Although the actual code I need to access is much more complicated baby steps, I wrote a simple subroutine to return the square of an integerp  precodeSUBROUTINE SQa,asquare DEC ATTRIBUTES C, REFERENCE, MIXEDSTRLENARG, DLLEXPORT, ALIASSQ  SQ   integer, intentin   a              input   integer, intentout  asquare        output   asquare  a2 END SUBROUTINE SQ  codepre  pI import the library and call it within Qt withp  precodetypedef int MyPrototypeint i     MyPrototype Square  MyPrototype FAST.resolveSQ     int K  4     int J  SquareK codepre  pThis results in a segregation errorp  p3 Is there any way to check if the library has, in fact, loaded Of course calling a subroutine would accomplish this, but that isnt working, and when I import the library DLLname.load returns a positive result. and resolve.subname has a memoryaddress allocated to it. Does this suggest a type fault Ie. passing the wrong identifier in to the fortran code.p  pOnce again, thanks for reading and please feel free to take apart any flaws in logic I have, Im not a programmerp

Negative 6557 pIm building a plugin component for Dynamics CRM 2015. Because were deploying to CRM Online, the plugin has to be a single signed DLL  we cant deploy additional DLLs alongside it and we cant put anything in the GAC, so Im using strongilmerge.exestrong to merge and sign my assemblies into a single DLL.p  pProblem is that, as far as I can see, EasyNetQRabbitMQ arent sending any messages when theyre ilmerged. I can reproduce this locally, so its not a CRM environment issue.p  pIve got three DLLsp  ul liMyPlugin.dllli liEasyNetQ.dllli liRabbitMQ.Client.dllli ul  pIf I reference these DLLs separately in my test code and invoke .Execute on my plugin code, everything works beautifullyp  pI have a postbuild stepp  pcodeSolutionDirpackagesilmerge.2.14.1208toolsilmerge.exe outTargetDirMyPlugin.Ilmerged.dll keyfileTargetDirpluginkey.snk TargetDirEasyNetQ.dll TargetDirRabbitMQ.Client.dll TargetDirMyPlugin.dllcodep  pThis spits out a single signed DLL, codeMyPlug.Ilmerged.dllcode, that in theory contains EasyNetQ, RabbitMQ and my plugin code. Everything compiles just fine. If I remove the individual DLL references from my test code and add a single reference to this ILMerged assembly, it compiles fine, and the code doesnt throw any exceptions  I just dont get any messages appearing on the queue.p  pMight this be related to the assembly binding redirect that EasyNetQ is using to resolve RabbitMQ Or something Im completely stumped as to how ILMerge could be causing it to fail silently without actually throwing any errors or anything.p

Negative 6557 pIm working with a legacy database and I need to perform some custom logic whenever something gets saved to the database in one of its tables.  This includes checking several fields to see what kind of data has changed, updating a field with the appropriate change status, updating other rows in the table and then finally inserting a new row or updating an existing row.p  pObviously this is way more than the SQLInsert or SQLUpdate annotations can do.  What would be the best approach to accomplish this  I need something that gets called when an object is about to be saved, does some manual SQL calls and then cancels the builtin save functionality since we took care if it manually.p

Negative 6557 pI am by no means an expert in HTML or CSS. I am fairly new, and have little experience. I have come across and issue and I am not sure how to fix it. As you  can see from the JSFiddle linked below there is a white gab between the image and the navigation bar. The image is a backgroundimage created in CSS. I would like to remove the gap so that the image is flush with the navigation bar.p  pI have tried changed the values for the margin and padding of the headerimage div as well as the nav div. I know if I make the margintop a negative value, it can fix the problem, but that is a very clunky solution because I would constantly have to change that value if I increase font size or anything like that. I have also search stackoverflow for similar problems, but none of them fixed my problem.p  pI also realize that I probably could have done many things differently in terms of how I coded some things, again I am new. The following code is the HTML code, the next block is the CSS code. Sorry if I did not explain something well, if you require more information, I will try my best to elaborate further on the issue. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to look at my issue. All the best. If you notice anything else, whether it a possible error, or just not a good solution for something, I would love to here about it.p  precodelthtmlgt      ltheadgt          ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefabout.cssgt         lttitlegtSean Andersonlttitlegt      ltheadgt     ltbodygt          ltdiv idcontainergt              ltdiv idnavgt                  ltulgt                      ltligtlta hrefabout.htmlgtAboutltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefachievements.htmlgtAchievementsltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefschool.htmlgtAcademicsltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefcontact.htmlgtContactltagtltligt                  ltulgt              ltdivgt             ltdiv idheaderimagegt                  lth1gtSEAN ANDERSONlth1gt               ltdivgt             ltdiv idwhoamigt                  lth2gtWHO AM Ilth2gt                 ltulgt                      ltligtI am a student at SFS High Schoolltligt                     ltligtI am an aspiring programmerltligt                     ltligtComics, books, programming, casual gamingltligt                     ltligt4.0 GPAltligt                     ltligtStar Wars is my lifeltligt                  ltulgt                  ltimg srctestbackground.jpggt              ltdivgt             ltdiv idskillsgt                  lth2gtSKILLSlth2gt                  ltulgt                      ltligtFamiliar with Java, HTML, and CSSltligt                     ltligtSkilled with Microsoft Office Suite 2013ltligt                     ltligtSkilled in math, science, and Englishltligt                     ltligtAwesomeltligt                  ltulgt              ltdivgt             ltdiv idfootergt                  ltpgtCopyright ampcopy 2015 Sean Andersonltpgt              ltdivgt          ltdivgt      ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  hr  precodebody       fontfamily Helvetica, sansserif     width 100     backgroundcolor white     marginleft 0px     margintop 0px     container       width 100     backgroundcolor white     margintop 0px    nav       backgroundcolor black     marginbottom 0px    nav ul       liststyletype none     padding 30px 0px 30px 0px     textalign center     margintop 0px     marginbottom 0px     minwidth 1920px     nav li       display inline     textalign center    nav a       textdecoration none     textalign center     color white     fontsize 30px     padding 30px 50px 30px 50px    nav ahover       backgroundcolor white     color black    headerimage       backgroundimage urltestbackground.jpg     backgroundrepeat repeat     height 1000px     width 100     margintop 0px auto     display block     clear both    headerimage h1       textalign center     verticalalign middle     paddingtop 150px   codepre  pHere is the JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSeanathon983nw5wj1d relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netSeanathon983nw5wj1da The image takes up the whole width on my monitor, not sure why is doesnt appear that way, as I did use width 100.p

Instead, id like to create an object in the first test, keep the same instance in the additional tests, execute them in sequence, and stop executing the spec if one fails. p  pI understand that usually the way to do something like this is to put initialization and destruction code into the fixture or mixin BeforeAndAfter. Thats great, but in this case initialization and destruction are precisely what Im trying to test, and theyre complex multistep processes.p  pI tried doing this with fixtures, but scalatest apparently wants to create a new instance of the fixture for each test. It also doesnt seem to guarantee that the tests will be executed in the same sequence, not in parallel. And, running from maven, doesnt seem to guarantee that only one spec will be run at a time.p  pSurely others must have dealt with similar issues beforep  pEDIT  heres some sample codep  precodeclass MinimalExample extends fixture.FlatSpec     case class FixtureParamvar thingy String    def withFixturetest OneArgTest       val tester  new FixtureParamnull     withFixturetest.toNoArgTesttester       Creating a minimally reproducible example should start with creating a String in  fixture gt     val command  A string     fixture.thingy  command     fixture.thingy shouldBe a [String]       it should still be a String in this second test in  fixture gt     val command  fixture.thingy     assertcommand  null      it should still be a String we mean it in  fixture gt     fixture.thingy shouldBe a [String]     codepre  pId expect all three tests to produce the same result.

Negative 6557 precodeRequirement  codepre  pI need to write a server that should be able to receive multiple client connectionsFCFS order and be able to process each client in a separate thread, so that the processing looks like as if all the clients are served concurrently. The transport protocol being employed should be UDP. Also several round trips of data transfer would happen between client and server, and the data that is received from the client has to be stored at the server side for further processing with respect to this client. p  precodeImplementation codepre  pTo achieve this, I employed a queuethreadpool mechanism. Initially I create a pool of fixed number of threads and have a queue datastructure to store clientaddresses. This queue is shared among all threads, and hence I used mutex to lockunlock this queue. In the main server thread, I create a socket, bind it to a global portaddress and then I block the server on recvfrom call. Any client that wants to communicate with the server sends a Hi message to the main thread server listening on the global portaddress. The main server thread upon receiving this Hi datagram pushes the clients sockaddr structure onto the queue and goes back to block on the recvfrom call to accept other clients. p  pAny of the pool threads that gets a lock on the queue, pops the clients address and starts processing this client all by itself. That is, the pool thread will now create a socket, bind it to a different port than the global port and sends this portaddress to the client using the clients address it has popped off. At the client side, after sending the Hi message, it blocks on recvfrom call and once it receives a message from the serverwith a different port, it stores this portaddress and from then on, it communicates with the server only using this new port sent by the pool server thread.p  precodeClarification needed codepre  pI have noticed in many Stack overflow questions that A SINGLE SOCKET is always sufficient in multithreaded UDP server, but according to my requirements I think I need multiple UDP sockets, each one catering to a client. Please provide me suggestions on my approach of threaded UDP server for my requirementsp  pstrongEDIT Improved the designstrongp  pThanks for all your comments and discussions about my design. After grasping all your views on singlesocket connection and context switching,  I have an improved design in mind. Please provide feedback on my improved designp  pIn this implementation, I am going to use only one global UDP socket that is bound to a globally known portaddress. Just like before, I will create a fixed number of threads initially, say 5 threads. Then I perform recvfrom on the single socket in all my threads. Whichever thread receives the datagram first, will be able to know three things out of this datagramp  ul liClient sockaddrAddress of the clientli liClient dataActual data sentli liProcess numberSent along with the data. This is to let the server know  what kind of processing has to be done on the client datali ul  pBased on the information above, the server thread will process the data based on the process number and sent reply to the same client from which it received. After processing data and sending the replyif necessary, this thread will go back to blocking on the recvfrom call. p  pAlso, details about various clients would be stored in global hash table and mapsaccessible to all threads, so that any thread could access it to process according to that particular client.p  pstrongChanges at the client sidestrong The server should be able to know what processing it has to do on the client data. Hence the client would send process number along with the data.p
