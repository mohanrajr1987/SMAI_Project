However, things dont work as the expected way, when the usercontrols are partially shown because of the screenapplication height is not enough.p  pEven though commands buttons are visible, the commands are not getting fired. Instead, The ListBox is getting scrolled to the last item and the partially shown item becomes fully visible.

Positive 3946 pI am trying to implement a custom multipage dialog that takes an arbitrary number of visuals slides and displays them.  The desired behavior would be that the selected item would appear at the topcenter of the display area in the foreground.  The previous slide would be at the bottomleft with a lower zindex, and the next slide would be at the bottomright with a lower zindex.  Previous and Next buttons would set the selected index.  In the set method for the index, I loop through the slides and set an integer value called SelectionState based on whether each slide is hidden, selected, just before the selected one, or just after the selected one.  I am trying to position the slides based on this integer using IValueConverters.p  pFor my Listbox.ItemsPanelTemplate, I tried using a Grid.  In the ItemsTemplate, I was setting the Grid.Column and Grid.Row using IValueConverters.  Stepping through code, I can see that the value converters are being called, and that they are returning appropriate values, but all items appear in row 0, column 0 anyway.p  pAfter getting frustrated, I tried changing the Grid to a Canvas and setting the Canvas.Left and Canvas.Top properties, and again, I can see that I am getting good values back from the converter, but all items position themselves in the topleft corner anyway. This code is shown, but commented outp  pSince I know the value converters are behaving as expected, does anybody else see what I am doing wrong  Thank you in advance for any suggestionsp  precodeltGrid xNameDialogLayergt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Height gt             ltRowDefinition Height420 gt             ltRowDefinition Height gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltColumnDefinition Width gt             ltColumnDefinition Width1100 gt             ltColumnDefinition Width gt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt          ltListBox xNamelbSlides ItemsSourceBinding CurrentFormSet.InterviewSlides Grid.Column1 Grid.Row1 ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityHidden ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityHiddengt             ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt                     ltGridgt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width100 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                             ltRowDefinition Height60 gt                             ltRowDefinition Height300 gt                             ltRowDefinition Height60 gt                         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltGridgt                     ltltCanvas Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1 gtgt                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt             ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltltBorder BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness1 Width600 Height360 Canvas.TopBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToCanvasTopConverter Canvas.LeftBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToCanvasLeftConverter Panel.ZIndexBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToZIndexConvertergt                         ltTextBlock TextHello World gt                     ltBordergtgt                     ltBorder BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness1 Width600 Height360 Grid.ColumnBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToGridColumnConverter Grid.RowBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToGridRowConverter Panel.ZIndexBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToZIndexConvertergt                         ltTextBlock TextHello World gt                     ltBordergt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt         ltListBoxgt     ltGridgt codepre

Positive 3946 pI am making a GUI programmatically and have run into a small question regarding the uicontrol listbox and the data each value or string refers to. I feel this question will best be illustrated with some code. The code at the end of this question illustrates my question.p  pIf you run this example, select all 5 files from the left listbox and press Button1, you will see them go into the right listbox. You can then select 1, or several of the files in the right list box and press Button2 and MATLAB will output the correct files names. All is fine here.p  pIf you close and re run the program, and just select file1, file3, and file5, pressing Button1 will make them go into the right list box again. This is where my problem is If you select all of the files now in the right list box file1, file3, file3, and press Button2, matlab outputs file1, file2, and file3... not file1, file3 and file5 as I would like.p  pNow I understand why this is happening, because in a list box its codevaluecode property starts at 1 and increases, and the underlying data in the Cell codeDataSetcode remains ordered file1 to file5... So codevaluecode 1 2 3 refers to codeDataSet1code codeDataSet2code codeDataSet3code...p  pWhat would be the best way to overcome this problem I would like to add that for my actual GUI the file names might not always be so obviously named.p  precodeclassdef example lt handle      properties         Figure         Button1         Button2         ListBox1         ListBox2          DataSet       end      methods         function obj  example             createobj             makeUpDataobj         end          function createobj             obj.Figure  figurePosition,[300 300 640 640]              obj.Button1  uicontrolStyle,pushbutton,String,Button1,...

Positive 3946 pIf I have a codeListBoxcode in WPF that has a codeGridcode inside its codeDataTemplatecode, how would I reference that codeGridcodes various codeColumnDefinitioncode properlyp  pWhat I am trying to do is have a codeListBoxcode that contain grids with 3 columns each. The last 2 columns have circles that can be red or green. In order to draw the circle, I am using codeEllipsecode, and in order to make that into a circle, I simply want to bind the width of the ellipse to the height of the codeRowcode for that codeGridcode. p  pSince there is only 1 row in each codeGridcode in the codeListBoxcode, this should result in the codeEllipsecode staying as a circle no matter how I size the codeListBoxcode or codeGridcode.p  pI am having trouble however, properly referencing that codeRowDefinitioncode from inside of the codeGridcode, which is itself inside the codeDataTemplatecode.

Positive 3946 pThis is a proof of concept project in an attempt to use javascript to enable an event listener on a listbox and execute javascript drag and drop to the same listbox.p  pWhen executing the code, if I click on the listbox first, the javascript function tied to the event listener pickupSticks executes as is demonstrated by a couple of alert statements.p  pHowever, if I place some text in the first textbox and drag and drop it into the first listbox, my click event no longer fires.  The same thing happens if I use the actual button to move the data once.p  pThe reason my javascript include is where it is, is that it seems as if the objects must be created before the addEventListener can find the listbox or an error is returned not able to find object. p  pWhat confuses me is the apparent deactivation of the eventListener AND my javascript code after a successful drop. p  pDEFAULT.ASPXp  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeFileDefault.aspx.cs InheritsDefault gt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt     lttitlegtTest DampD and Click Event on listboxlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt         ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager1 runatservergtltaspScriptManagergt         ltaspUpdatePanel runatservergt         ltContentTemplategt         ltdivgt         ltaspButton IDButton1 runatserver TextButton OnClickButton1Click gt         ltaspTextBox IDTextBox2 draggable true  ondragstart  dragevent runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt          ltaspTextBox IDTextBox1 runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt          ltaspListBox IDListBox1 draggabletrue ondropdropevent ondragoverallowDropevent  runatservergtltaspListBoxgt          ltaspListBox IDListBox2 runatservergtltaspListBoxgt          ltdivgt          ltContentTemplategt          ltaspUpdatePanelgt    ltformgt    ltscript src  dragndrop.jsgtltscriptgt    ltbodygt    lthtmlgt codepre  pDefault.aspx.js looks like thisp  precodeusing System project compiles and executes without these libraries. using System.Collections.Generic using System.Web using System.Web.UI using System.Web.UI.WebControls  public partial class Default  System.Web.UI.Page      protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              ifIsPostBack                      ListBox1.Items.AddApples             ListBox1.Items.AddBananas             ListBox1.Items.AddOranges             TextBox2.Focus                   protected void Button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e              ListBox1.Items.AddTextBox2.Text         TextBox1.Text  ListBox1.Items.Count.ToString         for int i  0 i lt ListBox1.Items.Count i                      ListBox2.Items.AddListBox1.Items[i]                  TextBox2.Text           TextBox2.Focus          protected void ListBox1SelectedIndexChangedobject sender, EventArgs e          this fires only when adding an element to the listbox         TextBox2.Text  ListBox1.SelectedIndex.ToString       codepre  pdragNdrop.jsp  precodedragNdrop.js  add event listeners var mouseClick  document.getElementByIdListBox1 mouseClick.addEventListenerclick, pickupSticks, false var mouseClick  document.getElementByIdListBox2 mouseClick.addEventListenerclick, pickupSticks, false  base functions function dragev             ev.dataTransfer.setDatatext, ev.target.id          function dropev      document.getElementByIdButton1.click     ev.preventDefault   function allowDropev      get and store the target listbox id     ev.preventDefault     var x  event.clientX, y  event.clientY,         elementMouseIsOver  document.elementFromPointx, y     target  elementMouseIsOver.id     document.getElementByIdTextBox1.value  target   special functions function pickupSticks      alertPickupSticks     var x  event.clientX, y  event.clientY,         elementMouseIsOver  document.elementFromPointx, y     target  elementMouseIsOver.id     document.getElementByIdTextBox1.value  target     alertdocument.getElementByIdtarget.selectedIndex  codepre

It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those dont need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. Thats probably a good topic for a different question though...p
Negative 3946 pI am working with a large Java web application from a commercial vendor.

To summarize p  pI didnt simply put an codeImageFieldcode on the codeRoomcode model because I wanted more than one image associated with the Room model.  I chose a generic Image model because I wanted to add images to several different models.

I didnt make this clear in my first post, so sorry about that.p  pSeeing as none of the answers so far has addressed how to make this a little more DRY I did come up with my own solution which was to add the upload path as a class attribute on the image model and reference that every time its needed.p  precode Models class Imagemodels.Model     contenttype  models.ForeignKeyContentType     objectid  models.PositiveIntegerField     contentobject  generic.GenericForeignKeycontenttype, objectid     image  models.ImageFieldImage,                                 heightfield,                                 widthfield,                                 uploadtouploadsimages,                                 maxlength200 class Roommodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength50     imageset  generic.GenericRelationImage    The form class AddRoomFormforms.ModelForm     image1  forms.ImageField      class Meta         model  Room   The view def handleuploadedfilef       DRY violation, Ive already specified the upload path in the image model     uploadsuffix  joinuploadsimages, f.name     uploadpath  joinsettings.MEDIAROOT, uploadsuffix     destination  openuploadpath, wb     for chunk in f.chunks         destination.writechunk     destination.close     return uploadsuffix  def addroomrequest, apartmentid, formclassAddRoomForm, templateapartmentsaddroom.html     apartment   Apartment.objects.getidapartmentid      if request.method  POST         form  formclassrequest.POST, request.FILES         if form.isvalid             room  form.save             image1  form.cleaneddata[image1]               Instead of writing a special function to handle the image,               shouldnt I just be able to pass it straight into Image.objects.create              ...but it doesnt seem to work for some reason, wrong syntax perhaps              uploadpath  handleuploadedfileimage1             image  Image.objects.createcontentobjectroom, imageuploadpath             return HttpResponseRedirectroom.getabsoluteurl     else         form  formclass     context  form form,      return directtotemplaterequest, template, extracontextcontext codepre

Negative 3946 pIn a COMaddin for Outlook using Redemption I need to be able to determine whether a given message that Im looking at was received or sent I only want to act on the incoming ones. Simply looking at the parent folder or the recipients or senders will not work in my case as both incoming and outgoing messages might be thrown together inside the same public folder and there can be multiple valid senders. Furthermore there might also be internal messages sent from one valid sender to another.p  pChecking for codePRRECEIVEDBYcode or codePRRCVDREPRESENTINGcode to identify the incoming mails is also no complete solution for me because these properties are only set in mailbox stores and the messages Im dealing with will most commonly be in the Public Folder Store more precisely in mailenabled Public Folders, where messages sent on behalf of that folder are placed as well.p  pI already used OutlookSpy to compare MAPI properties of various sample messages and thought several times I had found something but so far nothing I found proved to be an ultimately stable solution e.g. at first codePRMESSAGERECIPMEcode appeared to only ever be set on incoming messages and never on outgoing ones, but then I found incoming messages where that property was also missing.p  pEssentially, Im looking for some property or value thereof that is strongalwaysstrong set on either incoming or outgoing messages strongonlystrong.p  pThis needs to work at least with Exchange 2003 and 2007 and Outlook 2003 and 2007.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 3946 pI am writing a MVVM application and one of the screens is quite significant in size. The screen maintains and object that has multiple lists of other objects that also get editied within the context of the transaction.p  pIve broken the views up into multiple user controls. The model is broken up into the different class types. The problem is the ViewModel. Because it agregates information from multiple object types and does passthrough on so many properties, it is likely to be several thousand lines of code by the end. None of this code is complex, it just feels wrong.p  pIs this an unavoidable consequence of the patternp  pShould I be looking at multiple ViewModels in this case Possibly, one per model class. p  pHow have people handled nontrivial examples in the real world as opposed to yet another demop  pthanksp  pBTW WPFPrismCMVVM environmentp

Negative 3946 pWe are using TFS build and we have a couple of custom steps within the configuration e.g. running NUnit tests in codeAfterCompilecode target, deployment steps in codeAfterDropBuildcode target etc..

The thing is that codeValueAcode can only be of a few certain types lets say codestringcode, codeintcode and codeFoocode which is a class and codeValueBcode can be another small set of types.  I dont like treating these values as objects I want the warm snugly feeling of coding with a bit of type safety.  p  pSo I thought about writing a trivial little wrapper class to express the fact that ValueA logically is a reference to a particular type.

That is, in a typical rowmajor representation as a onedimensional array of codeM  Ncode elements, the memory distance differs between adjacent cells in the same row code1code and adjacent cells in neighbouring rows codeNcode.p  pId like a data structure that reduces or removes this difference. Really, the name of such a structure is sufficientmdashI can implement it myself. If answers happen to refer to libraries for this sort of thing, thats also acceptable, but they should be usable with C.p  pI have an application that needs to perform fast image convolutions emwithoutem hardware acceleration, and though Im aware of the usual optimisation techniques for this sort of thing, I feel a specialised data structure or data ordering could improve performance.p

Negative 3946 pI have a Rails application irrelevant, I know and I want to authenticate an iOS app against the Rails app, and persist the authentication so future requests to the Rails API work without reauthenticating each request. Conceptually, heres what I want to do... Im not sure if this is the best approach, though.p  pAlright, so in my Rails app each user has a unique token SHA1 hash. I was thinking the first time the iPhone app is loaded, the user would see a usernamepassword screen. Theyd enter their credentials for the Rails app, and upon successful authentication, the Rails app would return their unique user token that could then be stored in the keychain And from there on out, I was thinking I could simply append the user token to all API requests and thats how I could verify the user within the Rails app. This would also keep the usernamepassword independent of the iPhone app so the user could change their usernamepassword in the Rails app, but the iPhone app wouldnt care about that since it would be using their token, which would not change.p  pI thought my URL requests might look something like thisp  precodehttpexample.comapiv1[whatever].jsontokenXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX codepre  pDoes that sound like a reasonable approach to take Or are their concerns Im not aware of with this approach Ive been doing Rails work for a long time, but Im relatively new to iOS only have 1 app under my belt, and it didnt require any authentication.p  pIf this is a good approach to take, is it hard to work with the keychain I think I read that the simulator and the device itself dont support the same APIs for keychain access or maybe the simulator doesnt support mock keychain accessp  pThanks in advance. I tried searching through older posts, but none seem to answer my specific situation.p

Negative 3946 pA while ago, I picked up a copy of the OpenGL SuperBible fifth edition and slowly and painfully started teaching myself OpenGL the 3.3 way, after having been used to the 1.0 way from school way back when.  Making things more challenging, I am primarily a .NET developer, so I was working in Mono with the OpenTK OpenGL wrapper.  On my laptop, I put together a program that let the user walk around a simple landscape using a couple shaders that implemented pervertex coloring and lighting and texture mapping.  Everything was working brilliantly until I ran the same program on my desktop.  p  pDisaster  Nothing would render  I have chopped my program down to the point where the camera sits near the origin, pointing ematem the origin, and renders a square technically, a triangle fan.  The quad renders perfectly on my laptop, coloring, lighting, texturing and all, but the desktop renders a small distorted nonsquare quadrilateral that is colored incorrectly, not affected by the lights, and not textured.  p  pI suspect the graphics card is at fault, because I get the same result whether I am booted into Ubuntu 10.10 or Win XP.  I did find that if I pare the vertex shader down to ONLY outputting the positional data and the fragment shader to ONLY outputting a solid color white the quad renders correctly.  But as SOON as I start passing in color data whether or not I use it in the fragment shader the output from the vertex shader is distorted again.  The shaders follow.  I left the preexisting code in, but commented out so you can get an idea what I was trying to do.  Im a noob at glsl so the code could probably be a lot better.p  pMy laptop is an old lenovo T61p with a Centrino Core 2 Duo and an nVidia Quadro graphics card running Ubuntu 10.10 My desktop has an i7 with a Radeon HD 4850 x2 single card, dual GPU from Saphire dual booting into Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows XP.

Negative 3946 pIve got one question about the structure of a database when using hibernatep  pI have to save information one number for every day in the database. Very often I need to select the information for a whole month.p  pWhen Ive got a table with date, information, then I have to do up to 31 selects to get the data for one month. As I do this very often, it stresses the database.p  pNow I thought of writing the whole information 31 numbers into a MONTHtable, with a column month and another column information, where I put in all the numbers seperated by a . Then I would only have to do one select. But I would have to split up the datarecord in order to get the numbers split up at every .p  pSo maybe, another solution would be a MONTHTable, with 32 columns month and 1 to 31. the 1 to 31 columns would be tinyints and I would store the numbers in it. I would have to make one select to get the data from each month and I would not have to split up the datarecord but could request the data per column I use hibernatep  pDoes this last solution have any disadvantages I didnt think of  Would you recommend another solution Thank youp  p[EDIT] Thanks for your help.

Negative 3946 pBit of a weird one this Ive got a shared Office addin that currently targets Outlook 2007 on XP and Win7 ExcelWord and other versions later.  It adds a toolbar button, and this fires off my code.  My code just reads data from Outlook.  First time round, it works a treat.  Second time, the button click does nothing.  No errors, nothing.  The rest of Outlook responds as normal.p  pThe entire event code is in a trycatch that writes any exceptions out to a temporary file this mechanism works if a throw an exception in code, but nothing is picked up.p  pAccording to the Trust Center, my addin is active not inactive or disabled.  If I restart Outlook, or stop and start the addin via the Trust Center, it again works once and then stops.p  pIf I reduce the amount of work my code does, the button will sometimes respond for about ten clicks or so, then gives up.  Whichever version of my code I try, resources dont seem to change much memory moves up a mite, the thread count stays the same.p  pIve read of a similar thing with Word, but this was explained by Word recreating the toolbars or menus every time it loads a document not sure how correct this is.  For me, I select an email, click once, it works, click again no changing views in Outlook, selecting different emails, etc, and it doesnt.p  pHas anybody got any clues herep

I dont have an extensive history in ASP.NET programming, but so far most of my work on the project has been HTML manipulation anyway. For the most part, its been pretty simple to just scaleresizerearrange all the various text fields and buttons such that they display pretty nicely on a mobile device. One of the text fields, however, has a CalendarExtender attached to it, and the little calendar popout is so small its difficult to even read on a mobile device, to say nothing of trying to actually select a specific date. Is there a simple way I can just make the calendar bigger It doesnt seem to have any of the typical resizing attributes Ive seen height, width, fontsize, etc.p  pIn case it helps, Im programming on Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2010, in C.p

Negative 3946 pFor my first ASP.NET MVC 3 application, Im using the codeaspnetUserscode and codeaspnetRolescode tables to provide authentication for my users and for a few roles.  That seems to work pretty well.  Additionally, I want to make associations between the loggedin user and rows in various tables.  p  pAs a concrete example, Ive got a codeRecipescode table which has columns specific to recipes name, dates, attributes as well as a codeUserIDcode column.  That codeUserIDcode column is currently a foreign key to a codeUserscode table in my IceCreamDB NOT the codeaspnetUserscode table in the aspnetdb which contains various domainspecific information about users of the system.  So, its easy enough to create a query that retrieves all of Matts recipes, by creating a user in my Users table named Matt who has some integer UserId and then use that UserId during Creates and Updates to the codeRecipescode table.  Great.p  pTo tie the loggedin user itsmatt from the aspnetUsers table to my IceCreamDBs Users table UserId for Matt, I have a Guid column in IceCreamDB Users table which is filled in with the aspnetUsers Id its a Guid for the login.  p  pIceCreamDBs Users tablep  precode UserId     1                primary key used as FK for other tables   UserName   Matt  Phone      5551212  Department Product Development  Building   2A  Office     221  UserGuid   7fc75a6c7e3243f3be8cbe0122bf54cb  Guid from aspnetdb User table codepre  pAnd this works OK  as part of the user registration process, I create an aspnetUser, set up whatever roles e.g., Administrators, Owners, Production are appropriate, and then create a user entry in the IceCreamDB Users table, copying the Guid into the new row.  This lets me log into the website and see my recipes or my orders.p  pBut I feel Ive homebrewed this solution and theres likely a better, different approach to doing this. Id like some guidance on this. p

Negative 3946 pFacebook authentication is working great. I can pull the profile pic and name of the user.  However, when you click login and the facebook prompt comes up I have two problems in both IE and Chrome.  p  pFirst off, the window never closes.  It just goes to a blank white page.

I tried subscribing to the auth.login event and calling a reload there, which is what the documentation recommends, but this didnt refresh when you logged in.  It also caused a problem where if you logged out it would just automatically log you back in.  Thats why I added the code below to detect a logout and reload.  That actually works.

Negative 3946 pIm toying with the idea of adding a remoterun personal build for Mercurial ability in the TeamCity Visual Stuio plugin.p  pSince v6.5, TeamCity supports a remote run branch trigger, where if a named branch matching the trigger in TeamCity is pushed, TeamCity will run a personal build of that branch.p  pThe idea is taking the current outgoing changesets from the current branch lets say codedefaultcode, and moving them to a temporary named branch called coderemoteruncode. This is then pushed to the CI, so the personal build gets triggered, and if the personal build is successful, changes are moved back to the original branch, and the coderemoteruncode branch is deleted.p  pI have a few questions regarding thisp  ol liDoes it even makes senseli liWhich extension should I use for this I believe MqExtension does everything I would need, but are there alternativesli liWhat would happen if the user commits additional changes during the remote run How would the temporary branch changesets merge back into the original branchli ol  pThe scenario Im currently targeting is as follows while working on the default branch, user adds 3 new revisions. He then wants to run those changes as a personal build on TeamCity, but he forgot to commit those revisions to a specially named branch. Instead, my addin will take those outgoing changes, and put them in the named branch. Once the personal build succeeds, those changes are then placed back in the original default branch, and pushed to the remote repository.p  pSomething like thisp  precode[default] ABCD codepre  pAssuming codeBcode, codeCcode and codeDcode are the new revisions, I want the tool to dop  precode[default] A                         [remoterun] BCD codepre  pAnd after its done, return it to the original state, i.e.p  precode[default] ABCD codepre  pstrongEDITstrong I managed to move the changes to another branch with Mq, this ended up being very easy. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to revert this change p  pHope this makes sensep

Negative 3946 pI am new to web development and Java servlets. So please be patient with me while I explain what I am trying to accomplishp  pI am building a Time Entry application where the authenticated users can enter their time, date, project, description etc, which are then stored into a MySQL database. p  pThe application is built using Java Servlet which dynamically generates the HTML not JSP interface, which the user sees and enters hisher time from. As the user enters the form with the relevant time entry information, the servlet enters these info into the MySQL database. I am using Apache Tomcat as my server.p  pIdeally, I would like to build a web page or may be integrate with the same web page, where the user can see hisher previous time entries based on date or project names. The idea is simple  the user clicks on 7 days and the MySQL returns all the time entries for last 7 days. p  pSince I am new to servlet programming, the only way I think I know how to do this is to write another servlet, which is invoked when the user clicks on 7 days and the servlet reads the input, generates the MySQL query and returns the result to a new page.p  pI am wondering if theres a better way to do this. I havent programmed in PHP before, but I am willing consider PHP if thats a better way to handle this. But I am not sure how to integrate PHP into my existing Dynamic Web Project inside Eclipse IDE for Java EE. p  pAny advicep

Negative 3946 pI know this is a topic much talked about, but I still wasnt able to find a correct and clear answer to my specific problem.p  pIve got a JSON that looks like thisp  precodevar myData    gameID  gameID,                 nrOfPlayers  2,                 playerUIDs  [123, 124]              codepre  pThe Question I have is exactly what is the correct way or best way, style wise to parse this in a Java servlet using GSON for example First I send this JSON to the server using jQuery ajax method like thisp  precodejQuery.ajax         url  path,         data  myData,         success  successFunction,         error  functiondata              console.logError , data           ,         type  post,         timeout  30000      codepre  pNow in the servlet Ive learned that I should have been able to parse that JSON like thisp  precodeprotected void doPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException          Gson gson  new Gson          String gameID  gson.fromJsonrequest.getParametergameID, String.class         String nrOfPlayers  gson.fromJsonrequest.getParameternrOfPlayers, String.class         String[] playerUIDs  gson.fromJsonrequest.getParameterplayerUIDs, String[].class          log.infogameID         log.infonrOfPlayers         log.infoplayerUIDs[0]   playerUIDs[1]  codepre  pstrongBut the playerUIDs variable IS NULL and of course playerUIDs[0] throws an exceptionstrongp  pDigging deeper I found that when looping over the request parameter names, it contained a strongparameter named playerUIDs[]strong with the strongvalue of only 123strong the first int in the array. This was strange cause I didnt seem to be able to access the next values at all.p  pThen I read that JSON objects should be stringifyed before POSTing so I added JSON.stringifymyData, but now the request parameter names only strongcontained ONE namestrong which was the JSON object itself in a stringified statep  precodeINFO Parameter name  gameIDb6a51aabb8364b04bce676eafde1bc87,nrOfPlayers2,playerUIDs[123,124] codepre  pThe only way I seemed to get this to work was by creating a inner classp  precodeclass GameStart      protected String gameID     protected int nrOfPlayers     protected int[] playerUIDs  codepre  pAnd parsing the JSON from the request parameter name, like thisp  precodeprotected void doPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException           Gson gson  new Gson         Enumeration en  request.getParameterNames         GameStart start  null         while en.hasMoreElements              start  gson.fromJsonString en.nextElement, GameStart.class                  log.infostart.gameID         log.infoString.valueOfstart.nrOfPlayers         log.infostart.playerUIDs[0]   start.playerUIDs[1]  codepre  pNow all values are there, but this seems more like a hack reading JSON from request parameter name than an elegant solution, so I thought Id ask you guys what exactly would be the correct way of doing this Am I missing something obviousp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3946 pMaybe I am missing something simple here, but it is frustrating me. So what I need to do is update something on my server when this div around a link is clicked I am doing click thru analytics. I figured I would do a click event and do an ajax call via get. p  precode.getstat418491289 codepre  pBut the problem is, the call isnt being made. The user is being sent to the next page and not calling get call isnt being completedcalled. I would know because on the server it would update the database. Maybe I shouldnt be making an ajax call, or maybe there is something I should be doing, but I am not sure. I cannot suspend the link action for now because it is wrapped in the div. What I would like to do ideally is fire off the request and then not worry about it. Updating the stat is not critical, so if it doesnt work 1 of the time, that is more than ok. How would I do thisp  pI guess I might not be being clear. What I am asking is Can I fire off a request to my server via javascript before the browser goes to the linked page I dont care what the response is, I just need to send the request.p

Negative 3946 pi have to setup an android maven build for a customer, which previously was based on ant.p  pThe base app is a white label implementation and the app is distributed to several third party customers. Each of those customer versions uses the same source code and a set of shared resources.

I only included relevant filesfolders and the structure is remained from the ant buildp  precodeApp src res rescustomer1 rescustomer2 pom.xml codepre  pThis means i have to build multiple .apk artifacts from the same source with different resources. What is the best approach to do thisp  pThe first thing i tried was to use different profiles in my main projects pom for every customer. Then i wrote a shell script to execute all maven builds 1 per customer.p  pThen i came up with using only one release profile in my main project and passing the customer specific properties via command line. Properties are passed via a shell script, similar to my first approach.p  pBut im not happy with that, so i thought about using multiple modules. One per customer. But my problem here is, how i can build those from the same source without copying the source from my main project over to all modules Or do i have to setup an android project for every customer and refer to my main project as apklib Will this merge the shared and the customer specific resourcesp  pIs there a best practice to do something like thisp  pAny other approach is also very welcome.p

Negative 3946 pI have a question about jQuery Mobile. The thing is that i use a very long list with dynamic elements loading When user scrolls to the end of the list, he taps on load more items and then another 30 elements are loaded and appended to the existing list. When he taps on an element, a dialog is shown with info,etc When the user closes the dialog, the list is refreshed and first 30 items are loaded. This is annoying because its a very long list 1300 elements. p  pHow can I prevent this happening Is there a way of parsing parameters from dialog closing button to previous page Or any suggestionsp  pPS I can provide any line of code you want I didnt put any code for now because Im not sure which part to post p

Negative 3946 pplease excuse the extensive detail I am about to give you on my problem.p  pI am currently programming a schedule generator. It has a lot of constraints It must be able to deal with team numbers ranging from 412 412 teams needing a game scheduled It must be able to deal with changing play requirements play everyone once, play everyone twice, play everyone three times etc It must be able to deal with odd numbered teams It must be able to deal with missing weeks It must be able to deal with.... some other things.p  pAnyway, all of that is OK and Ive solved that. The problem comes when I deal with the final requirement It must be able to assign a pitch to each game, from a range of 4,5 or 6 pitches. It must strongfairly distribute games on each pitch to each teamstrong. For example, if team 1 only has 1 game on pitch 4, but team 2 has 9 games on pitch 4, thats not a fair distribution.p  pThis is where I come up a mess. I can not get the games fairly distributed. Ideally, the number would equal out. However, I am not sure if thats mathematically possible, which is why I say there may be a design problem.p  pCurrently, the PHP code loops at various stages  first it creates the schedule for round 1 play eachother once, then it creates the full schedule round 1 X number of times play each team, then it assigns the games in that order to the active weeks, and then finally it assigns the rinks to the games. Now there are checks at each step, and if something goes wrong it starts strongemeach stepemstrong again, for example, it typically takes 35 loops for the first schedule, hundreds for the complete season schedule ensuring no team plays more than once per week etc, and then were into thousandsmillions of loops depending on how strict I make the pitch fairness. Currently the check works every time if I allow the range to be 4, however when I make the range 321 it becomes less reliable, and so far only a 6 team league will produce a pitch schedule where each team is within 2 games of another team on the same pitch, no schedule gets as close as 1 difference or 0 difference. p  pSo my question is  does anyone know if I am trying to solve a mathematical impossibility, and if not, do you have a design suggestion on how I can solve this Currently I cut the code off from the pitch assignment at 10 million repetitions, if you think giving it 100 million would eventually cause it to find the right pitch assignment and its not impossible, as I am running it locally I can just do that. Resources are not an issue as far as my PC goes, I just need to get it to work.p  pThank you for all your time and comments, any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3946 pI am currently working on an BI solution and I need to make some design decisions.

We have the measures, KPIs and dimensions and we know what data we need to present to the EndUser.p  pAn easy solution would be to use a Sharepoint server via PerfomancePointDashboard designer which provides a decomposition tree amongst the OLAP controls it offers. The problem here is that we only need to show the data generated from the cube. There is no need for any of the collaboration andor content management features of sharepoint.p  pAnother would be to make a new web application WebForms for example using one of the 3rd party olap tools for .Net This I suppose would be simpler from a development point of view but no decomposition tree is a deal breaker for us.p  pThe most important question here is, if there are any olap Controls out there 3rd party or not that include a decomposition tree.p  pIs there any way in the form of a library to strip the OLAP controls from sharepoint and use them in a web forms projectp  pIs it possible  and if it is, is it a proper practice  to strip the sharepoint site of any additional controls and leave only the dashboard surrounded by any theme we choosep  pHow would you advise me to present the SSAS data to a client who is a simple user with little to none IT knowledge who just wants to view statistics and charts without needingwanting to understand an entire new and complex environmentp

My question is if this comparison function should be defined in the class heap or in the class Object If I define it in class Heap then for every data structure that I use I need to rewrite the comparison function which is not efficient.

Negative 3946 pAt work, we are trying to switch to Git, but are encountering some problems let me state from the beginning Im the only one at work who has some basic experience with Git, another coworker has worked with Subversion in the past, but thats it.p  pWe envision things as followsp  ul liWe have a main directory where stable projects are located and our project managers can review sites and debug if needed. This main directory lets call it MAIN is also the origin repository for all developers.li liAll developers working on the project have a subdirectory on the server where we clone MAIN, work on our changes and push to MAIN again. We pull each others changes from there as well. li ul  pWe tried doing this today, but quickly noticed it is not recommended to push to a nonbare repository master  master. This makes sense to me when I read why. I found some solutions if you want to per se do master  master pushing to a nonbare repo, but they all require executing various commands on the origin either resetting or merging from a different branch. The solution then is, as far as I can tell convert MAIN into a bare repository. However, this would mean that our PMs are no longer able to view the project, as there is no working directory. p  pWhat would be the best approach to solve this Do we set up a hook that automatically exports the bare MAIN repository so we can view the files p  pExtra thing MAIN will become a clone on its own over time we have a default template thats used for every project, I thought it would be good practice to clone MAIN from the default template and then add stuff onto it. Is this considered bad practice Pushing back to the default template is not necessary, however we might want to pull bugfixes. Should we just start the bare MAIN repo and copypaste the default template into itp

Negative 3946 pSo basically, I have a tab bar where you have an add button to clone tabs and later edit them. My problem is that once so many tabs are added, my left and right arrows and my add button are removed. How can I add tabs, but keep my buttons from disappearing Fixed position is not an option, I want the buttons next to the newest tab, and once the bar reaches a maxwidth, the buttons stay there. the arrows are to scroll through the tabs to see ones that will be hidden on overflow. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpHraC1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpHraC1ap  pstronghtmlstrongp  precodeltdiv classtabBox stylemaxwidth800pxgt   ltul classtabsgt     ltli classselectedgtlta hrefgtCertificate of Quantityltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtCOQ  ProductsChemicalsltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtMovement Summaryltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtBarge Surveyltagtltligt      ltul classtabButtonsgt       ltligtlta href classtabNavLeftgtltltagtltligt       ltligtlta hrefstep2b.html classtabNavRightgtgtltagtltligt       ltligtltdiv classtabNavAdd titleAdd another report form to nomination stylemargintop6pxgt       ltinput typebutton valueadd classaddTab gtltdivgtltligt     ltulgt                 ltulgt   ltdivgt codepre  pstrongjquerystrongp  precode add new tab input.addTab.liveclick, function event    var ultab  this.closest.tabs  cache ul.tabs   var li  ultab.childrenlinot.selected.first  cache the row     ultab.childrenlilast.afterli.clone.finda.attrhref, .textNew Tab.end  codepre

Im using SQLCe in my code to read from various tables and write to one. So far, the code for reading from the tables works fine, so thats any connection issues out the way first. The piece of code I am struggling with is as followsp  precode        string connectionString  Properties.Settings.Default.BookingSystemDatabaseConnectionString         using SqlCeConnection myConnection  new SqlCeConnectionconnectionString                      myConnection.Open             try                              string commandStr  INSERT INTO bookingsusername, room, time VALUESusername, room, time                 SqlCeCommand myCommand  new SqlCeCommandcommandStr                 Passes parameters into SQL command.                 myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValueusername, StaticUser.StudentUser.username                 myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValueroom, roomBox.Text                 myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuetime, timeBox.Text                 Executes SQL command. Returns the number of affected rows unecessary for my purposes a biproduct if you will.                 myCommand.ExecuteNonQuery                          catch                              System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.ShowCould not write new booking to database. This is likely because the database cannot be reached., Error                 Program.AccessError  true                          myConnection.Close          codepre  pThis is just one of the many ways I have tried to combat the issue I am having. I have also exploredp  precodemyCommand.Parameters.Addnew SqlCeParameterusername, StaticUser.StudentUser.username codepre  pto pass the parameters...and another method which escapes me now using .Value  StaticUser.StudentUser.username I think. Furthermore, I have tried using a using statement for the command to save me closing the connection myself I will probably end up using a solution that uses using. Finally albeit this isnt a chronological recollection, I triedp  precodeSqlCeCommand myCommand  new SqlCeCommandINSERT INTO bookingsusername, room, time VALUESusername, room, time, myConnection codepre  pAgain, of course, to no avail.p  pTo highlight the actual symptoms of the issue I am having The code appears to run fine stepping through the full method I have pasted above shows that no error is being caught of course, the message box does not appear  I realised afterwards that stepping through was arguably an unnecessary procedure and in the other methods I have touched on, the same thing happens. The issue, then, is that the table bookings is not actually being updated.p  pSo, my question, whyp  hr  pI didnt do the obvious and check the Debug folder for an updated database.p

My solution was creating a variable in the shared memory and I save plenty of memory.

The result of such conversion is determined by calling the code[[DefaultValue]]code internal method of the object. In case of an empty array, it defaults to code0code. ECMAScript Documentation, sections a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec11.4.611.4.6a, a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec9.39.3a, a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec9.19.1a p  pcodefalse[0]code were accessing the character at index code0code, hence the codefcodep  h2letter codeacodeh2  pSame story, the only difference here are additional conversions in the part in square brackets which evaluates to a number to point at another character in the string codefalsecode, triggered by the use of unary codecode and codecode operators.p  pcode[]code evaluates to code0code, as explained above.p  pcode0code evaluates to codetruecode as defined in a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec9.2Section 9.2a and a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec11.4.9Section 11.4.9a.

Negative 3946 pWhen the user presses a button, a text view should pop up in the middle of the screen. Two requirementsp  p1 Whatever was displayed before should still be visible except where covered by the text view or keyboard.p  p2 If the user taps outside the text view or keyboard, nothing should happen.p  pI thought that if I presented the text view in its own VC, that would address 2, because I think thats how modal presentations work. However, when I do this, even though I set the background of the text views VC to transparent and tried reducing the frame, all I get is the text view surrounding by black. Nothing is visible behind the presented VC.p  pEDITp  pIt has come to my attention that apparently when you use a tab bar controller, that object does all of the presenting, no matter what VC actually sends the present message to itself. I am using a tab bar controller. Maybe this is part of the issue and forecloses the option of using presentViewController. So I need a different methodp

Negative 3946 pI have code that does a good job of centering html inside one page on abcpdf. This was provided to me from websupergoo company that created abcpdf.  However, my application pool keeps shutting down, and I believe its a performance issue.  I even have caching enabled.  Is there anyway to optimize this code.  Basically what is happening is the code makes calls to a html page, and figures out the boundary dimensions to set the browser width so it can fit within the pdf dimensions.  Doing this makes calls over and over to a html page, but I was told if its cached it wouldnt make an actual request but read the cache.    There just has to be a easier way to do this since it does take a while to render.  This issue seems to happen when multiple requests to a url that uses abcpdf at once.p  precode            using var doc  new Doc                              doc.HtmlOptions.Timeout  60000

So, IIS may be blocking calls from outside not allowing reach into the SignalR hub from Windows Phone 8 app. Accordingly, I tweak applicationhost.config for the SignalR server app to allow connectivity from outside localhost. So now, the SignalR hub is functional from both localhost and also off the local IP.

Negative 3946 pI am writing my first application for WP8 platform in C. I implemented three datatypes namely locationModel which has locationGroups. Each locationGroup has a ObservableCollection of type locationData.p  plocationData has two double types for latitude and longitude and a title string.p  pI used a textblock inside a stackpanel to show the locationData elements title, where the lat long are hidden to user.  There is a context menu on each of this textblock element which enable the user to delete the respective locationData. When I open the app and delete any item, it succesfully does and updates the view too. But when I do it for another item it just doesnt work. I cannot delete more than one items for each time I open the app. p  pI used breakpoints to see where the problem is. the selected locationData is succesfully passed to the App.ViewModel.LocationModel.Items.Remove. But it just that they are not deleted from the observable collection. I even tried to see the index of the locationData in observable collection and use RemoveAt method. Even it doesnt work.  I did a lot of research to find the problem, but no one seems to face the same problem as me. I referred to msdn article on how to implement inotifypropertychanged to update the collection. But its too complex for me to understand that. p  pI dont really understand why the observable collection delete the item for the second time even though if I pass the index of that item. And my usage of breakpoints showed me that the data is not even null. p  pSo kindly tell me what is causing this problem and how do I overcome it so that I can implement my own workaround and not face this issue again.

Negative 3946 pI was wondering if there is any way on a MySQL slave server to get a consistent read for a specific query. Lets say I send a query to the slave server at 83015, and at that moment, the slave is still processing queries from the master bin log with timestamps dating from before that point in time. For that specific query though, I specified in some way to the slave that I want a consistent read, so the slave would put a hold on the read query until it has caught up to 83015 in the master bin log, thus allowing me to receive a result that is consistent with what would have been given by the master had it received the query instead. Of course, that would cause a delay for me while I wait for my read result, which I wouldnt have to suffer if I had requested directly from the master, but it still allows me to send that query to the slave and get a consistent read from it.p  pIs there anything in MySQL that allows for this kind of query specific options on a slavep  pThanksp

Negative 3946 pIm writing WCF services that will be used by clients out in the wild so they need to handle crossorigin requests. I have a problem with enabling my development server to accept such requests. Here is the scenariop  ul liIm running the WCF project in an instance of Visual Studio 2012, using IIS Express 8 as the server on a specific port.li liIm running the client project in another instance of Visual Studio 2012, also using IIS Express 8 as the server. This project uses AJAX to consume services in the other project.li ul  pWhen I run the client project in IE there is no problem because IE does not send the preflight OPTIONS request. When I run it in Chrome however the preflight OPTIONS request returns a 405 Method Not Allowed and Chrome gives up on the service. Previous versions of Chrome would just ignore the error and continue with the actual POST request or Get, whatever... but later versions appear to be pickier.p  pIve also run into this with a deployed WCF project and solved it by moving the OPTIONSVerbHandler to the top of the Handler Mappings list in IIS.p  pI should point out that Im using the most generous web.config settings I can think of to try to allow CORS.

Negative 3946 pI have one View that displays a video.  A video can be either recorded on the device or downloaded and subsequently had some validation operation on it.  We have a ViewModel to represent each state although they share a common ViewModel base class.p  pWe reuse the same view for both as they are 99 identical.  The downloaded ViewModel has a couple of extra properties related to the validation whether its been accepted or rejected.  Given that we use the same view this generates binding errors for the Recorded videos.p  pHow can I work around this problem  I would have thought that if these visual elements were invisible they wouldnt generate binding errors they are invisible unless its on a saved recordingp  precodeltStackPanel xNameValidationHistory VisibilityBinding IsSavedRecording, ConverterStaticResource BoolToVisibilityConverter, FallbackValueVisiblegt     ltStackPanel VisibilityBinding HasAcceptedValidationSessions, ConverterStaticResource BoolToVisibilityConverter, FallbackValueVisiblegt         ltTextBlock TextBinding NumberOfAcceptedValidationSessions, FallbackValue0  gt     ltStackPanelgt ltStackPanelgt codepre

Negative 3946 pIn my code, I initialize a lot of floats with 0, 1 and 2 values or other small ints. While GCC produces no warnings for this, MSVC does. So I replaced all 0s by code0.fcode, 1s by code1.fcode, etc... Also initializing a float with 0.5 issues a warning, and I replaced it by 0.5f.p  pWhile I fully understand that doing codefloat fsomeIntcode or codefloat fsomeDoublecode should produce a warning as in some cases precision is lost, the compiler should be smart enough to know that 0, 1, 2 and 0.5 are exact float values. And my code is much less readable like that...p  pIs MSVC not using some standard Should I let him complain or make my code less readablep  pThanksp

If your app depends on telephony features such as for managing SMS messages, include a  element in your manifest that declares the android.hardware.telephony hardware feature. Alternatively, you can check for telephony availability at runtime using either hasSystemFeaturePackageManager.FEATURETELEPHONY or getPhoneType.p  pSo, Im guessing that if the device doesnt have the above feature it cannot manage SMS messages be the default SMS app.p

Negative 3946 pThis is a HibernateJPA question around updating an object in the database.  p  pI have an object that I created in another transaction using entityManager.persistobject.p  pThis object is returned and then some values are updated.

Once refresh is called, the data is back to the original values.  p  pI would expect that the call to flush would persist the information to the database. p  pI tried commenting out the refresh call, thinking the save does not happen until I leave the method wrapped in transactional.

Negative 3946 pIm screwing around with the Visual Studio 2013 C compiler what Im doing is not really important or interesting at all and Im running across some very odd behavior. Right now I have the codep  precodevoid funvoid      int ebp  int ampebp  1  codepre  pWhich should give me a pointer to ebp using Visual Studios stack semantics. NOTE I have set Basic Runtime Checks to Default and I have disabled security checks. When I look at the memory when debugging in Visual Studio I seep  precode0x009BFBFC  41 03 81 51 fe ff ff ff 44 fc 9b 00 codepre  pWhere code0x009BFBFCcode is the address of ebp. Note that there is a random 2 in the location immediately preceding ebp code0xfffffffecode. Also note that the saved ebp is right after this 2 code0x009bfc44code. Okay I say, Ill just add 2 instead I now have this codep  precodevoid funvoid      int ebp  int ampebp  2  codepre  pAnd when I run it and look at the memory, this time I seep  precode0x0032FCD8  fe ff ff ff 1c fd 32 00 5e 3c 39 00 codepre  pAgain, code0x0032FCD8code is the address of ebp. What madness is this The random extra space is now gone giving me a pointer to the return address insteadp  pIs this deliberate I cant see any reason why the Visual Studio compiler would intentionally prevent me from accessing the base pointer from code, but then again I cant see why the compiler would behave so oddly when I change a two to a one. For those curious, I looked at the disassembly and the first example does allocate 4 more bytes than the second for no apparent reason its not used anywhere. If anyone has any insight, that would be awesome this is kind of irritating that it would do this.p

Negative 3946 pI am currently writing an application that uses codeBTLEcode to pass small strings of data between 2 or more phones. p  pCurrently in the foreground I am passing though codeCBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKeycode and codeCBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKeycode. I am able to recover via NSLog the string passed through the CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey when the app is in the foreground.p  pHowever when the app is in the background, the codeCBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKeycode is not passed through. The codeBTLE UUIDcode is still passed through along with the codeRSSIcode integer, the codeCBAdvDataChannelcode and the codeCBAdvDataIsConnectablecode. p  pAfter combing through what seems to be an unending circle called Apple Documentation, I have found no way to pass a small string while the app is in the background. It seems to me that they wouldnt allow codeBTLEcode in the background if there was no way to pass data.p  pMy question is does anyone know a workaround to pass data in the background with BTLE or a method that may allow me to do so Any help or tips would be appreciated. p  pEdit I should make clear that the Library I am trying this with is called Vicinity a hrefhttpsgithub.comInstrumentVicinity relnofollowhttpsgithub.comInstrumentVicinitya which uses codeCoreBluetoothcode to get around the background limitations of codeCoreLocationcode.p

Negative 3946 pWe have been using Asana for group Task management for a while, but have had a hard time making it useful for anything but the simplest use case. It thus cyclicly goes in and out use. The main problem is making Asana work for both a processpipeline and managing subprojects. Unfortunately Asana has a fixed hierarchy project, task,and hidden subtasks which due to there buried nature are difficult to use, so it is hard to make it work flexibly. p  pThe only ordering method is the Section titles, which can be used to organize the list for subproject UI, Database, backend OR process Backlog, Todo, inprocess, done... but not both.p  pNow, you can use section titles for process stages, and then projects list for subprojects. But there is no way that I know of to see a meta view of all projects. We find that lack of a unified projects view hierarchy, or merged tasks, or side by side columns, or swimlanes makes it difficult to see the big picture of the overall project. p  pI am interested in any ideas, solutions, features, or methodologies that you can share that solve this dilemma to implement a SCRUM type approach with subprojects in Asanap

Negative 3946 pFor unit testing purposes I need to completely resetclear SQLite3 databases. All databases are created in memory rather than on the file system when running the test suite so I cant delete any files. Additionally, several instances of a class will be referencing the database simultaneously, so I cant just create a new database in memory and assign it to a variable.p  pCurrently my workaround for clearing a database is to read all the table names from codesqlitemastercode and drop them. This is not the same as completely clearing the database though, since meta data and other things I dont understand will probably remain.p  pIs there a clean and simple way, like a single query, to clear a SQLite3 database If not, what would have to be done to an existing database to make it identical to a completely new databasep  hr  pIn case its relevant, Im using Ruby 2.0.0 with a hrefhttpsgithub.comsparklemotionsqlite3ruby relnofollowsqlite3rubya version 1.3.7 and SQLite3 version 3.8.2.p

Negative 3946 pI have programmatically created a codeUITableViewcode and I have also programmatically created UIButtons to be included with every codecellcode  coderowcode. I have set these buttons so that if they are tapped, their specific cells data will codeNSLogcode to the console.p  pThe codeUITableViewcode has 2 codesectionscode. Originally, all of the cells are placed in the 2nd section, but if I find a particular stringa persons name, then that cell is moved to the 1st section.p  pEach cell has a codetextLabelcode and a codedetailTextLabelcode. So far all of the cells work fine except for one.p  pWhenever I press a cells button, it is supposed to codeNSLogcode the codedetailTextLabelcode property of the cell.p  pHeres the problem. For some reason, all of the buttons work fine except for the very first one. The first cell visually shows the correct codetextLabelcode and codedetailTextLabelcode on the app screen. The codetextLabelcode value is Mom and the codedetailTextLabelcode value is momusername, so when I press this cells button it should be NSLogging momusername.p  pFor some reason though, it codeNSLogscode the codedetailTextLabelcode of the first cell in the second section with a value of dadusername, even though it visually shows the correct codetextLabelcode and codedetailTextLabelcode on the app screen.p  pWhats even weirder, is if I change everything so that it is supposed to NSLog the codetextLabelscode, the first cell will STILL codeNSlogcode the detailTextLabel.p  pI dont understand how the cell can visually show a textLabel of mom and a detailTextLabel of momusername, but then codeNSLogcode completely different values.p  pIt only wants to NSLog the codedetailTextLabelcode of the first cell in the 2nd section.p  pIs it possible that the cell is being reused when it shouldnt be, or that something is wrong with dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier p  pBelow is my entire View Controller from where I first start setting up the codeUITableViewcode.

Negative 3946 pI have a multimodule Maven project that is analyzed within Jenkins by Sonar. This creates a Sonar project containing metrics for the entire code base of my Maven project. The Sonar project has the same ID as the ID of my Maven project. So if my Maven project is emFooem with modules emM1em, emM2em, and emM3em then I observe that a Sonar project emFooem is created, and I can see the metrics for components emM1em, emM2em, and emM3em.p  pI am wondering if I can create another Sonar project that performs analysis on a subset of the Maven project. I can do this with Maven  Cobertura, by specifying a Maven profile that defines the set of packages to be included in or excluded from the Cobertura analysis. This allows me to produce a set of Cobertura reports one for the project as a whole, one for a packages emXem, emYem and emZem etc.p  pSo what I am looking at now is creating a Sonar project called emBarem that is the result of calculating metrics for the Maven project emFooem, and that Sonar project will be configured in such a way to include only packages emXem, emYem, emZem which may live in modules emM1em, emM2em, etc. It will kick off as a Jenkins job, checking out Maven project emFooem and calling the emsonarem postbuild action, somehow specifying Sonar project name emBarem instead of defaulting to emFooem. Then I hope I will have two Sonar projects emFooem representing the entire Maven project, and emBarem representing a subset of that Maven project.p  pIm wondering if a this is possible, and b will it work Im not sure if the Sonar database will be corrupted there will be modules emM1em, emM2em, and emM3em in the Sonar projects emFooem and emBarem, these may overwrite the database entries for each other.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pMaybe I can use the codesonar.branchcode property when invoking sonar as a postbuild action in Jenkins. p  pe.g.p  pJenkins Job Onep  ul liSCM checks out maven project emFooemli liBuild Step codeclean install DskipTestscodeli liPostBuild Action sonarli ul  pJenkins Job Twop  ul liSCM checks out maven project emFooemli liBuild Step codeclean install DskipTestscodeli liPostBuild Action sonar codeDsonar.branchBarcodeli ul  pI can setup the inclusionsexclusions for the emBarem branch in Sonar, as necessary. The downside of this approach is that the sonar analysis is run twice on two different branches. It would be much more efficient to run the sonar analysis once and then query the database to narrow the focus as required.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pIm running into a problem although I can run a sonar analysis on the branch, the sonar analysis of the original nonbranch Maven project is failing. The sonar analysis is taking 3 times as long, before it fails with MySQL errorsp  pcodeCaused by com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException Communications link failure.codep  pcodeThe last packet successfully received from the server was 28,962,745 milliseconds ago.

Negative 3946 pI have an IEnumerable and a predicate Func and I am writing a method that shall return a value if only one instance in the list matches the predicate.

Both cases should return null.p  pWhat is the recommended way to express this in LINQ that does not result in multiple enumerations of the listp  pThe LINQ operator SingleOrDefault will throw an exception if multiple instances are found.

Negative 3946 pAs far as I read about this topic d3.js uses for the main part SVG and not HTML5s Canvas. The advantages and disadvantages of SVG and Canvas are clear and already discussed. Now I found out that it is possible to use Canvas instead or in combination with SVG in d3.js. The main reason should be to get a better performance for large datasets like cubism.js does for realtime data visualization. My question is When I do use Canvas over SVG to get a better performance, do I have still the possibilities of interaction I know that Canvas itself allows manipulation, but it is much harder to implement than it is for SVG. So can I maintain the interaction of SVGs when I use the d3.js Canvas approachp

Negative 3946 pI am having issues with Safari on desktop and mobile devices being very slow to repaint elements with positionfixed when the user scrolls. p  pThe elements with positionfixed that safari is having difficulty with are the intro, and the footer elements of .portfolioitem .expandedcontent. The intro on scroll doesnt necessarily repaint to the correct zindex it is supposed to be behind other elements as the user scrolls. The footer elements on mobile dont stay in a fixed position above the content on scroll on iOS safari. Scrolling on iOS safari is jaggy iOS chrome, however, is fluid and everything is working as expected.p  pI did a fiddle where I stripped out all the images, fonts, and JS, and lo and behold, safari has no trouble with repainting positionfixed elements on scroll.p  pSince this is a portfolio site, stripping out my images is obviously not an option. I was really hoping to make this a true onepage site, and not use AJAX or anything to load content on demand. Am I asking too much of safari to have that many elements and be able to repaint the elements with positionfixed on scroll Chrome and FF dont seem to have a problem with it neither do IE9, 10, 11.p  pI am not completely certain its a repainting issue, but you can see in the video below that if I am forcing Safari to repaint by triggering an event that is not scroll, like a mouseover event, it repaints, and puts that positionfixed element in the zindex I specified in my stylesheet. So that fact, combined with the fiddle working just fine, is why Im assuming its a repainting issue, and not an issue with my code.p  pIm hoping to figure out a way to fix this issue without resorting to more JS or dynamically loaded content, to maintain the same design not abandon the idea of using positionfixed or a fluid layout just because one browser is having issues with it and to try to keep performance quick and smooth. I thought about using JS each time the user scrolled to force safari to repaint, but that seems to me like it would negatively impact performance in all browsers. I could really use some other peoples thoughts and perspectives on this.p  pthe site a hrefhttpsarahjean.co relnofollowhttpsarahjean.coap  pthe fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsjc8611n9z3W relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsjc8611n9z3Wap  pthe video a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu24724104positionfixedrepaintlagsafari.mov relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu24724104positionfixedrepaintlagsafari.movap  pThe htmlp  precode    ltnav datascrollheader idmainnavigationgt     ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefwork datascrollgtWorkltagt          ltligt         ltligtlta hrefabout datascrollgtAboutltagt          ltligt         ltligtlta hrefservices datascrollgtServicesltagt          ltligt         ltligtlta hrefcontact datascrollgtContactltagt          ltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt ltdiv classheader idheadergtHeader Contentltdivgt ltsection idintro classcontainergt     ltarticle classcontentgt             lth1gtIntroduction Textlth1gt          ltpgtWelcome to my super cool portfolio site.

Negative 3946 pWhat are the implicationscaveats that I would need to watch out for if I were to use the Linux environment variables as a simple way of sharing information between different processes written in Python For example, are reads and writes atomic on a singleprocessorcore systemp  pIm designing an embedded system on a Raspberry Pi where Ill have multiple independent processes performing monitoring and control. These processes would sometimes need access to a shared property that will be updated by another process. For example, one process might monitor an RFID reader and update an environment variable with the serial number of the last card swiped. Other processes would then be able to access that serial number and use it.p  pOnly reason why Im considering this idea is simplicity. Im only interested in sharing simple strings and numbers between processes, and I feel that this is simpler than using something like sockets.p

Negative 3946 pIve finished developing a pcie driver for an FPGA under a linux distributiuon. Everything works fine. But Im wondering where the base address register in the PCI Endpoint of the FPGA gets the base address. When Ive generated the PCIe Endpoint I was able to set up the length of the BAR, but not more. p  pIn the PCIe driver I do the standard functions like pcienabledevice, but I do not set up specifically a base address. p  pSo does the operating system set up the base address during startup or how does it work By the side I would like to know what initialisations the operating system gernerally do if an pcie pcie device is connected. Since I do see my pci device in lspci even if the driver is unloaded.p  pKind regards Thomasp

Negative 3946 pThe issue is mobile browsers will zoom in an input field or select dropdown on focus. Ive looked into different solutions and so far the most elegant I found does it with setting a fontsize of an input field to 16px. This works fine on a standalone input field but if you have a parent container which incorporates a button, after changing fontsize to 16px will make a bit of a gap under the button.p  pAnother solution would be to set a default fontsize for input fields to 16px and adjust a button size correctly. p  pSetting a fontsize to 16px doesnt prevent select dropdowns from zooming though. p

Negative 3946 pRelated content is here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9675471bestpracticetomaintainauseridmvcBest practice to maintain a user id MVCap  pThe authentication service, provided through IdentityDbContext, is ideal for my web application. I am able to add fields I want each user to have and everything is packaged nicely so I dont have to make big changes to authentication. Included in this package of goods is a ApplicationUserId that sits in the AspNetUsers. My question is should I be using the ApplicationUserId as my user id throughout the application, strongorstrong should I populate a separate, nonIdentity table to hold my user idp  pI would love if someone with a similar situation can explain their thought process of choosing one or the other or a completely different usagep  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs request, I need to transition from my WebForms application to MVC for scalability reasons. Previously in my WebForms application, I had a database with many tables. A majority of these tables were joint tables in which I used userId as a foreign key. In my previous application, I stored user information in a table called codeUserscode, and subsequent data was stored in codeUserHasMonitorcode, codeUserHasKeyboardcode, codeUserHasCPUcode, etc. I also had tables as codeMonitorcode, codeKeyboardcode and codeCPUcode. p  pMy WebForms application was to keep record of users and the parts of a computer that they owned. Each entity, such as a monitor or keyboard, was saved in its own table. Tables were joined together with joint tables and the data was displayed by querying the joint tables. p  pSince moving to MVC, I want to take advantage of the built in authentication that comes with the Identity provided by MVC. With this I get a unique userId and password hash and other fields that I find I will need. However, because this is a new ballgame, my question is how should I be using my user id now that it is within the Identity provider, rather than a custom codeUserscode table like I had before p  pI have it set up now, my MVC application, with 2 connection strings. One connection string handles all Identity tablework while my other connection string will hold my joint tables.p  pSo, to boil it downp  ol lipHow do I integrate a user id with an MVC application that also uses many joint tables Separate connection strings Two separate databasespli lipShould I be using virtual to connect my tables together within my models now that I am using Identity tables will this alter the way my joint tables lookpli lipAny code examples are always nice, Ive looked around but havent found a gooddefined procedure to use, so that is why my question is here.pli ol

Negative 3946 pId like some advise on how best to set up an ASP.NET MVC application that has a single client portal and multiple customer sites.p  pThe client portal allows any of the clients to login and manage their sites.  Each individual site is accessed by customers and needs to have its own customer database with the ability for login via a social login provider.  A customer could be a user of multiple sites in the application and would have a separate login for each.  p  pHow can I best structure the projects within the solution, and separate the logins across the sitesp  pMy current thinking isp  ul liDLLBAL Projectli liClient Presentation Project Views and Controllers for the client projects li liCustomer Presentation Project Views and Controllers for all the customer projects li ul  pThis is my first multi project solution, so any advice would be greatly appreciatedp  pthat handles all the client login and management p

Negative 3946 pI only see one unanswered question related to a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions22254997refreshlistviewwithcheckeditemsthisa, so I thought I would try asking again.p  pI have a codeListViewcode that populates from a codestringcode array.  The reason I need to repopulate the codeListViewcode is because I set the foreground color on some items depending on the current time, and the only way Ive found to set the foreground color is when the item is added to the codeListViewcode. If theres a way to change the color of existing items that would be great, but I cant find a way. Its frustrating that codeListViewcode is different in the Windows Store than in Windows desktop WPF apps.p  pAnyway, when items are selected the selections checkmarks disappear once the list is repopulated.  Ive found a way to find which items are currently selected before the refresh I think by using codevar selecteditems  myListView.SelectedItemscode but trying to use that to recheck the items after the refresh seems futile.  Any help is greatly appreciated as Ive been racking my brains for weeks over this.  It seems it should be so simple so Im really frustrated.p  pAnother way I was thinking would be to do a codeforeachcode on each item and checking if code.IsSelectedcode is true, but I cant seem to associate each separate item that way.p  pIn my mind Im thinking do something likep  precodeforeach ListViewItem Item in ListView.Items        if Item.isselected          do something so to remember which items are selected  codepre  pThen at some point after the new codeListViewcode is populated, do another codeforeachcode and if it matches the previous selected item, select it again. However, just programmatically selecting items seems difficult in Windows 8.1 Store Apps VS2013.  It even seems codeArrayListcode is no longer available now.  Why does MS have to keep changing thingsp

Negative 3946 pI have an application I want to be an alternative handler for outgoing calls. p  pIt would make sense to have an IntentFilter to handle CALL or CALLPRIVILEGED intents.

Negative 3946 pI am currently creating an EntityComponent design pattern implementation and have been trying to optimize it. Previously, I was using RTTI information to hash the name of the type Which was really slow, but was good enough to get things to work. Later Ive tried just using the pointer to the type information returned from codetypeidcode but that created some issues when trying to seek out components in a parameterized way from another project as the components existed in a dll. Does anyone know of a better way to implement this functionality that would work across the boundaries that exist Ive thought of just using the preprocessor to somehow randomly assign an id to types at compiletime. Ive also thought of somehow getting access to the vtable to find where the function pointers for pure virtual functions as the identity. Ive even thought of just hashing certain indexed characters of the type name and solving hash collisions where they rise. Yes, these are outlandish ideas but Im at a complete loss as to how proceed with the current situation.p  pI will gladly post any code if it is required. I am currently using codestdunorderedmapcode to store keyvalue pairs between the hash and component. Thank you.p

However, the userstudent is to determine, by clicking on a button, when an item is displayed.  Two such buttons are included in this example.p  pAll elements were drawn with visibilityhidden when you entered the page. When the student clicks a button I use JavaScript to set visibilityvisible for the desired item.  They are displayed.  However they are drawn much too fast.  Click the Sketch the parabola button and compare the speed to the speed when the blue parabola was drawn.p  pHow can I slow down the displaying so that it looks like someone is drawing the itemp  pOr is there a way to delay execution of the SVG path statement until the student clicks the button If this is possible then I can use visibility visible and everything performs as desired.p  pDel p

Negative 3946 pI have a vb.net windows forms app where I display records from and SQL table, sorted on 3 fields.  Now I need to also include a sort on a field that needs calculation.  Its not a huge table  about 600 records  and the operation will take place just a few times a day.p  pMy plan is to select the records into an intermediate table,  compute the extra field for each record, and then  select from this intermediate table, using sql to do the sorting including this new computed field. p  pDo you think its better to  a create this intermediate table each time, then delete the whole thing when done or  b have an empty table in the database that I fill and empty each time.p  pAny critiques of this plan also welcome.

Negative 3946 pIm building a website using the excellent Python a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.org relnofollowFlask frameworka in which there is a codetemplatescode folder and a codestaticcode folder. As the names suggest, the templates folder contains the templates which are rendered through the a hrefhttpjinja.pocoo.org relnofollowjinja2 templating enginea and the static folder contains static content such as css, images, and static javascript files.p  pThe javascript files is what Im having trouble with though. Sometimes I want to place a jinja variable in a piece of js like this for examplep  precodevar requestJson  text messageText, toUserId  user.id  codepre  pIf I do this in a do this in a code.jscode file in the codestaticcode folder though, it isnt rendered, so this only works if I place it between codeltscriptgtcode tags in the template file. That works, but it feels kinda messy because I now have some js in the static folder, and some js in the template files.p  pI could of course solve this by defining a codedocument.toUserId   user.id code in the template and using that in the .js files, but yeah, that also feels kinda like a hack.p  pSo my question is what is the bestpythonicneatest way of handling the insertion of dynamic values from jinja in javascriptp

Negative 3946 pLets say I have a parent class, codeArbitrarycode, and two child classes, codeFoocode and codeBarcode. Im trying to implement a function to insert any codeArbitrarycode object into a database, however, since the child classes contain data specific to those classes, I need to perform slightly different operations depending on the type.p  pComing into C from JavaC, my first instinct was to have a function that takes the parent as the parameter use something like codeinstanceofcode and some codeifcode statements to handle childclassspecific behavior. p  pPseudocodep  precodevoid someClassArbitrary obj     obj.doSomething a member function from the parent class     more operations based on parent class     ifobj instanceof Foo         do Foo specific stuff          ifobj instanceof Bar         do Bar specific stuff       codepre  pHowever, after looking into a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions500493cequivalentofinstanceofhow to implement this in Ca, the general consensus seemed to be that this is poor design. p  blockquote   pIf you have to use instanceof, there is, in most cases, something wrong with your design.   mslotp blockquote  pI considered the possibility of overloading the function with each type, but that would seemingly lead to code duplication.

Negative 3946 pIm trying to accomplish something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV1zP3l.png altenter image description herep  pCurrently, Im manually setting the width of the tiles equal to half the screen width.  This works well, but it makes adding dividers between the tiles as seen in the screenshot hard.  Luckily, it seems that in API 21, a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetGridLayout.html relnofollowthere is now support for weight in GridLayouta, quoted here for your conveniencep  blockquote   pAs of API 21, GridLayouts distribution of excess space accomodates   the principle of weight. In the event that no weights are specified,   the previous conventions are respected and columns and rows are taken   as flexible if their views specify some form of alignment within their   groups. The flexibility of a view is therefore influenced by its   alignment which is, in turn, typically defined by setting the gravity   property of the childs layout parameters. If either a weight or   alignment were defined along a given axis then the component is taken   as flexible in that direction. If no weight or alignment was set, the   component is instead assumed to be inflexible.p      pMultiple components in the same row or column group are considered to   act in parallel. Such a group is flexible only if all of the   components within it are flexible. Row and column groups that sit   either side of a common boundary are instead considered to act in   series. The composite group made of these two elements is flexible if   one of its elements is flexible.p      pTo make a column stretch, make sure all of the components inside it   define a weight or a gravity. To prevent a column from stretching,   ensure that one of the components in the column does not define a   weight or a gravity.p      pWhen the principle of flexibility does not provide complete   disambiguation, GridLayouts algorithms favour rows and columns that   are closer to its right and bottom edges. To be more precise,   GridLayout treats each of its layout parameters as a constraint in the   a set of variables that define the gridlines along a given axis.   During layout, GridLayout solves the constraints so as to return the   unique solution to those constraints for which all variables are   lessthanorequalto the corresponding value in any other valid   solution.p blockquote  pI put together this simple layout consisting of a GridLayout with 2 columns, trying to achieve two equallywide columnsp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin toolscontext.MainActivitygt      ltGridLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidcolumnCount2gt         ltTextView androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutgravityfillhorizontal androidtextHello androidlayoutcolumnWeight1 gt         ltTextView androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutgravityfillhorizontal androidtextHello androidlayoutcolumnWeight1 gt         ltTextView androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutgravityfillhorizontal androidtextHello androidlayoutcolumnWeight1 gt         ltTextView androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutgravityfillhorizontal androidtextHello androidlayoutcolumnWeight1 gt         ltTextView androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutgravityfillhorizontal androidtextHello androidlayoutcolumnWeight1 gt     ltGridLayoutgt ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pI thought that since all the children have equal column weight, it would result in equallywide columns.

Negative 3946 pWe have a website with many users. To manage users who transacted on a given day, we use Redis and stored a list of binary numbers as the values. For instance, if our system had five users, and user 2 and 5 transacted on 2nd January, our key for 2nd January will look like 01001. This also helps us to determine unique users over a given period and new users using simple bit operations. However, with growing number of users, we are running out of memory to store all these keys. p  pIs there any alternative database that we can use to store the data in a similar manner If not, how should we store the data to get similar performancep

The problem is my poor JVM keeps dying a painful death and  or throwing OutOfMemoryErrors any time the images start getting huge.p  pHeres what I have runningp  precodethe bands, width, and height fields are set in the native code And the rawBytes array is also populated in the native code.  public BufferedImage getImage     int type  bands  1  BufferedImage.TYPEBYTEGRAY  BufferedImage.TYPEINTBRG     BufferedImage bi  new BufferedImagewidth, height, type     ImageFilter filter  new RGBImageFilter         Override         public int filterRGBint x, int y, int rgb             int r, g, b             if bands  3                  r  int rawBytes[y  width  bands  3  x  3  2] amp 0xFF ltlt 16                 g  int rawBytes[y  width  bands  3  x  3  1] amp 0xFF ltlt 8                 b  int rawBytes[y  width  bands  3  x  3  0] amp 0xFF              else                  b  int rawBytes[y  width  x] amp 0xFF                 g  b ltlt 8                 r  b ltlt 16                          return 0xFF000000  r  g  b                    this is the problematic block     ImageProducer ip  new FilteredImageSourcebi.getSource, filter     Image i  Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.createImageip     Graphics g  bi.createGraphics     with this next line being where the error tends to occur.     g.drawImagei, 0, 0, null     return bi  codepre  pThis snippet works great for most images so long as theyre not obscenely large.

Negative 3946 pI have read the section in the nuget docs that explain you can put dependencies under lib and those will apply to just that framework. So libnet40, lib45, etc.  I believe this will create a package that will support both .net 4 and .net 4.5 platforms.  I have also read about people creating specific builds for each .net version. What is the best practice here and where do you define these mixed version libraries in the nuspec file by creating Groups or in the packages.config by setting targetFramework.p

The query with the columnstore index runs nearly as slow as the original query without an index, in some cases, even slower, even though batch mode is processing is used too.p  pSurprisingly, when I create an ever increasing primary key  ID on the existing table and rebuild the columnstore index, I get a 15X improvement on the CPU time and a 3X improvement on the elapsed time. p  pI dont understand how the addition of a primary key could affect query performance for columnstore indexes which store the data in a compressed format anyway.

Negative 3946 pWith a Regular Type, I mean the definition of Stepanov in emElements of Programmingem, basically, that theres the concept of equality and that objects which are copies of each other compare equal.p  pSo when you have a Regular Type codeTcode, and the equality relation is transitive ema  b ampamp b  c  a  cem, you can define a emnontrivialem hash function which is consistent with the definition of equality ema  b  ha  hbem.

To achieve that I used an udev rule to identify if an USB device is attached to the pc and if thats the case i call my scripts to install some apps onto the devices.p  pSo far, so good but there are some problems. At the moment we are connecting 5 devices at the same time, but it happens quite often that on one of the devices one ore more apps are not beeing installed. It doesnt follow a pattern, it just happens randomly. Sometimes also the performance of the computer decreases during the day.p  pI would highly appreciate your help.

But the Problems still exist. Maybee I need to log whats happening while installation but at the moment I have no clue how to do that.p  pstrongEdit 2strong After some time I think I found something but I still have no idea why. I think adb has problems when two devices want to install one app at the same time. I Managed it to receive an error message like coderm failed for datalocaltmpfoo.apk, No such file or directorycode. After that I switcht to first copy the Package to the devices and then install them with the shell package manager, but still no solution.p

Negative 3946 pI am trying to parse a few thousand html files and dump the variables into a csv file excel spreadsheet.

This is done by querying, using UnityHTTPs HTTP.Requestp  precodehttpslogin.live.comoauth20authorize.srfclientidCLIENTIDampclientsecretSECRETampreponsetypetokenampscopeSCOPE codepre  pI do not call this if I already have a valid accesskey  this works.p  pHowever, if I do not already have a valid access key, this statement basically returns the Windows Live login site. The user must then login in order for the accesskey to be returned in the URL at the point of accesskey.p  pThis process needs a web renderer plugin, CoherentUI is currently used. p  pThe idea is to do strongwithout a web renderer plugin.strong However I havent had any luck tracking down an oAuth statement that takes a user ID and password combination. p  pI havent had any luck with the Live ID documentation for this either the old Live ID aspxbased web authentication had this, but the pages have been marked this topic describes funtionality that will be obsolete.p  pIs there no choice except to redirect an unauthenticated user to the windows live login page p  pNote only the first statement is provided. From the point of getting the response from the first statement, the implementation is pretty much opaque on my end control is passed to Windows Live ID login and doesnt return to the Unity3D side until the accesskey is present in the URL, or an error is returned. p  pNote2 I understand that C is able to provide a customized sign in experience a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh826543.aspxcsharp relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh826543.aspxcsharpa, and use that to get the access key However, Mono C as used by Unity does not seem to support it the namespace LiveAuthClient doesnt exist  PLUS, I would like to continue using the REST implementation as it is more platform independent than the pure C solution.p
Negative 3946 pIm designing an android app that will be composed by both mobile and wear modules.

Negative 3946 pIm playing around with lambdas and got into my head that I wanted to try creating a simple dbobject mapper as a part of the learning.p  pYes, there are plenty of frameworks that already do this, but this is more about learning and the problem Ive run into is technical.p  pFirst, I wanted to define all mapping logic in an enum.p  pIt started out plain and simple with just a bunch of field namesp  precodeenum ThingColumn      id, language  codepre  pThat let me create the following method implementation not relevant which gives api user compile check on columnsp  precodepublic CollectionltThinggt findAllThingColumn... columns codepre  pAfter that I wanted to define more rules in the enum, specifically how results are mapped from a codejava.sql.ResultSetcode to my codeThingcode class.p  pStarting out simple I created a functional interfacep  precodeFunctionalInterface static interface ThingResultMapper      void mapThing to, ResultSet from, String column   codepre  pand added it to the enump  precodeenum ThingColumn      idt, rs, col gt t.setIdrs.getLongcol,      languaget, rs, col gtt.setLanguagers.getStringcol      ThingColumnThingResultMapper mapper..  codepre  pI created a codemapResultSetRowcode method which uses the lambdas from the enum to extract data from the codeResultSetcodep  precodepublic Thing mapResultSetRowResultSet rs, ThingColumn... fields      Thing t  new Thing     Stream.offields         .forEachf gt f.getMapper.mapt, rs, f.name     return t  codepre  pThe above codefindAllcode could then use the codemapResultSetRowcode to apply relevant mappers to the codeResultSetcode.

Negative 3946 pI need to track if the user is touching the screen across multiple views and separate screens throughout my app. I have already created a window delegate method to receive every type of touch event. The problem is that if I keep one finger on the first screen and tap a button with a separate finger that takes me to the second screen, when I release my original finger no event is fired. p  pThis problem is the same if you were to hold your finger on the screen before the app loads and then release it once its started, no event is fired for the touch ending. p  pI presume there is some in built system in iOS that states you have to start a new touch once the app has started or the screenview has changed, so if you release a finger that was already touching nothing happens. p  pIs there a way to detect this I really need to keep a constant accurate number of touches on the screen throughout the different screensviews within my app, especially if the user takes their fingers off the screen. p
