Positive 4682 pI am using google.maps.places.Autocomplete in my mobile app as part of an input field at the bottom of the screen.  when the user focuses on the input field the virtual keyboard appears shortening the app in order to fit the keyboard.  When this happens though the places.Autocomplete suggestions appear beneath the keyboard.  Obviously, you dont want to place the suggestions in front of the keyboard because then the keys are obstructed.p  pMy thought is to place the suggestions above the input field but I cant figure out how to do this.  It appears this is possible but I havent found a coherent way to manage this problem.  I am using Javascript havent converted to jQuery yet  yes, I know, let the flaming begin.   p  pIs there another way to manage this problem so the suggestions arent covered by the keyboardp

Positive 4682 pOn a MultiAutoCompleteTextView in android I am able to add entries and parse them just fine. After auto completing the most recent item, when I press backspace it will delete all the characters before I autocompleted the item. Great. Now my problem is when I have multiple entries already autocompleted. I want to be able to delete each entry with a single backspace rather than deleting each character individually. I have tried using a TextWatcher but couldnt really get that to go anywhere. Is there a way I could tokenize each entry as its own entity rather than appending it to a string like google hangouts and facebook do. Note this isnt a requirement, just a thought of how i could do it. Thanks for any help Ill post here if I find out more.p

Positive 4682 pId like to be able to autocomplete partial words to full words found in my documents and return a list of words and the number of documents those words are found in.p  pIt would be great if I could also do this on an existing query results. So if they user typed red tr I would have results for all documents that match red and then words like truck or train with their counts.p

Positive 4682 pI am having a hard time figuring out how to do this.p  pI am using google.map.places.Autocomplete and its all working fine, but due to appscreen sizes the paccontainer with the returned search listings is behind the devices virtual keyboard  and thus on about half of the devices I have tested the user cant see the returned address list.  Obviously you dont want the paccontainer in front of the keyboard because then various keyboard keys will be hidden.p  pHow can I force the paccontainer to appear above and scroll up the searchinput boxp

Positive 4682 pI want to implement a feature for Textbox Autocomplete. Currently I using jQuery Autocomplete but I am unable to implement a functionality which is related to search delay For example if I search for New , I will have an autocomplete list having [ New York,New South Memphis .....] Now, if I press S and immediately hit down arrow then I end up with selecting the first item ie New York rather than getting results for cities starting with New S. [A Web service call of search cities starting with New S gets triggered] What I want to achieve is to block the down arrow till the results are retrieved. If anyone can explain what I should focus to achieve this feature or is it not possible due to asynchronous nature of the Web Service call   p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodedocument.readyfunction       locations.keydownfunction           var keyword  locations.val         var url  httpautocomplete.wunderground.comaqformatjsonampcbmyCallbackFnampquery  keyword         .ajax             type GET,             url url,             async true,             dataType jsonp,             error functione                  console.loge.message                                 var myCallbackFn  functiondata      var cities  []     for i  0 i lt data.RESULTS.length i          if data.RESULTS[i].type  city              cities.pushdata.RESULTS[i].name                    locations.autocomplete         source cities     .autocompletewidget.addClassfixedheight codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.11.1themesuidarknessjqueryui.min.cssgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comui1.10.2jqueryui.js gtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srccustom.jsgtltscriptgt  ltstylegt .fixedheight  padding 1px maxheight 200px overflow auto  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv classuiwidgetgt ltlabel fortagsgtAutocomplete ltlabelgt ltinput idlocations typetext size50gt        ltdivgt       ltbodygt lthtmlgtcodepre div div p

Positive 4682 pI am starting to write in C. I use VisualStudio, but I dont like the autocomplete. I was mainly writing in Android and I really like the autocomplete of AndroidStudio and Eclipse. It there a way to make the VisualStudios one the same I dont like that when I have a one method which can take a different set of arguments overloaded I have to click up and down arrow, to see the parameters. Can it just show me a scroll list like AndroidStudio and Eclipse And is there a way when autocomplete some method to put automatically the braces  and semicolon  I am really new to VisualStudio and I dont know can I modified it in this way or I should have to use to it. I just dont find anything about this. Thanks in advance.p

Ive found in practice that just checking to see if the image ref is nil isnt consistent with current retain count values.p  pIs it a best practice to simply set the CGImageRef instance to nil after youre done with it and youve already released it so that a check for someCGImageRef  nil lets you know if there is an outstanding reference to itp  pThanksp

They are called rs1, rs2 and rs3.p  pI have quite a large piece of code later on in the script so I have created a function to save save space etc.p  pWithin the function I wish to use the information from the recordsets opened earlier.

Negative 4682 pI have a string[] containing individual words parsed out of a paragraph of text.  I need to display each word in its own cell, and have each cell be assigned a dynamic width based on the words length.  I want to be able to have as many words as possible within the maximum width of each row.   p  pIn short, Im trying to take a given paragraph of text and present it as a series of editable controls in a way which resembles how it might appear as a plain text document, with each word consuming only its required space on each line.p  pI first tried using a DataList with RepeatLayout in Table mode and RepeatColumns to a set value of 10, with a Repeater within containing a Label control this resulted in 10 words per row but each cell with a fixed width.p  pIve considered using a GridView with a single column which I would cram with as many words in the form of Label controls per row as will fit, adding new rows as necessary until the entire paragraph is built.p  pCould anyone please share an elegant way to do thisp

Negative 4682 pMy main view controller representing the Main Menu in my app has a simple UIView with a few sub views. I am using a modaltype design pattern and switch to multiple other view controllers before finally returning to the main menu. The problem is, in my other view controllers not the main menu one, I often load dataheavy images and the like which sometimes causes the main menu which is not currently onscreen to unload its view to in response to memory warnings. The problem is, when I ultimately switch back to my main menu, the screen is all black and all but a few UILabels have been dispensed of.

Lets say User is a grocery store.   Products are fruits, like apples.  And varieties are types of apples, like fuji and mcintosh.  p  pI need to create an app where   p  ul lipA user can add many types of products to his page.  The products can include multiple varieties, but the user is NOT required to include any varieties.  For example, Topps Grocery Store can add apples to their page.  If thats all they want to display, that needs to be ok.  However, they can also add more detail by including the types of apples they carry, like fuji, mcintosh, etc. The variety cant just be a detailed product.  In other words, I cant make each product be something like apple  fuji, apple  mcintosh.  They need to be two separate models.   pli lipOn the users page i.e. the show view, I need to be able to display both the product and the variety if any.  The system needs to understand that the varieties are connected to the particular product for this particular user. pli ul  pFollowing the first answer I received, I revised my models as described in the answer below.  Each variety belongs to one product, i.e. fuji belongs to only the apple product, which is a distinct id in the product table.  And, a product has many varieties, i.e. the apple product might have 5 or 10 different varieties.  p  pHowever, it gets more complicated because each user might have a different set of productvariety combinations.  For example, Topps grocery store user might have apples product that are fuji and mcintosh varieties.  But, Publix grocery store user might have apples product that are red delicious and gala varieties.  p  pOn the user page, I want to be able to call up each product the user carries and then display the varieties connected to each of those products if the user has chosen any varieties.p  pWhen I try the code listed below in the show view, I get the following error undefined method userproduct for         p  precodelt user.products.each do product gt    lt user.userproducts.findbyproductidproduct.id.varieties gt lt end gt codepre  pOn the other hand, when I try the other option you gave me listed below, the page loads and the sql query seems right in the log, but no varieties display on the page, which is weird because I triple checked and there are records in the database that should match the query.  Details below...  p  precodelt user.products.each do product gt    lt user.varieties.findbyproductidproduct.id gt lt end gt codepre  pThis code runs the following sql query    p  pcodeUser Load 0.7ms   SELECT  FROM users WHERE users.id  2   codep  pcodeVariety Load 0.5ms   SELECT varieties. FROM varieties INNER JOIN userproduct ON varieties.id  userproducts.varietyid WHERE seasons.userid  2   codep  pRendering template within layoutsapplicationbr  Rendering usersshow  p  pcodeProduct Load 0.7ms   SELECT products.

FROM varieties INNER JOIN userproducts ON varieties.id  userproducts.varietyid WHERE varieties.productid  2 AND userproducts.userid  2 LIMIT 1  code  p  pIn this case above, the user that Im looking at is codeuserid2, he does have productid1 and productid2 in the database. And, in the userproducts table, I do have a few records that list this userid connected to each of these productids and associated with some varietyids.code  So it seems like I should be displaying some results on my show view, but Im getting nothing.  p  pFinally, when I try the followingp  precodelt user.products.each do product gt    lth user.userproducts.findbyproductidproduct.id gt lt end gt codepre  pIt displays the following in my views for each record codeltUserproduct0x4211bb0gtcodep

Then allow the user to select a term from the textfield either through typing, arrow keys, or doubleclick.p  pHow would you apply this to XPath autocompletion p  ol lipshould there be an autocomplete key  In XPath there is no obvious separator key like dot in C.  should the popup be triggered explicitly in some other way, lets say ctrl.   or should the parser try to autocomplete continuously   pli lipIf I do the autocomplete continuously, how to scale it properly  There are 93 xpath functions, not counting overloads. I certainly dont want to popup a list of 93 choices. How do I decide when Ive narrowed it enough to offer a useful lsit of possible completionspli lipHow to populate the tree of possible completions   For C, its easy walk the type space via reflection. At a first level, the syntax tree for C seems like a single tree, and the list of completions at any point depends on the graph of nodes youve traversed to that point.  Typing codeSystem.Console.code traverses to a certain node in that tree, and the list of completions is the set of child nodes available at that node in the tree.  On the other hand, the xpath syntax seems like it is a flatter tree  function names, axis names, literals.  Does this make sensepli lipwhat have I not consideredpli ol

Negative 4682 pWe have an asynchronous task that performs a potentially longrunning calculation for an object.  The result is then cached on the object.  To prevent multiple tasks from repeating the same work, we added locking with an atomic SQL updatep  precodeUPDATE objects SET locked  1 WHERE id  1234 AND locked  0 codepre  pThe locking is only for the asynchronous task.  The object itself may still be updated by the user.  If that happens, any unfinished task for an old version of the object should discard its results as theyre likely outofdate.  This is also pretty easy to do with an atomic SQL updatep  precodeUPDATE objects SET results  ... WHERE id  1234 AND version  1 codepre  pIf the object has been updated, its version wont match and so the results will be discarded.p  pThese two atomic updates should handle any possible race conditions.  The question is how to verify that in unit tests.p  pThe first semaphore is easy to test, as it is simply a matter of setting up two different tests with the two possible scenarios 1 where the object is locked and 2 where the object is not locked.  We dont need to test the atomicity of the SQL query as that should be the responsibility of the database vendor.p  pHow does one test the second semaphore  The object needs to be changed by a third party some time after the first semaphore but before the second.  This would require a pause in execution so that the update may be reliably and consistently performed, but I know of no support for injecting breakpoints with RSpec.  Is there a way to do this  Or is there some other technique Im overlooking for simulating such race conditionsp

Negative 4682 pI suspect the answer is no, but here goes..p  pIm using the WebForms Report Viewer on a publicfacing website to allow users to report on themselves or their users if the user is an admin user.p  pA report has a parameter called Users where an admin can pick a user from the list and generate a report from it. Mundane users can also view this report, but I programmatically create a linked report for each user and set the UserID value to their ID so they can only view themselves.p  pThis works well except that the UserID parameter is querybased, and not every user is visible in the list using default settings the user list is based off date range parameters can provide, and only users we consider active during the date range are visible.p  pThis is blowing up for mundane users that are not active for the default date range which is the previous month.p  pI suspect the flow of execution is something like thisp  ol liReport loads with default parametersli liThe linked report rules are now applied and the value of the UserID is overridden with the ID in the linked reportli liUserID field is now hidden to prevent the user from changing itli liSSRS cant find the UserID default value in the query results that I didnt even want it to run so it displays an error bThe UserID parameter is missing a valuebli ol  pThrough some testing Ive found a perfect correlation between users not inside the default date range and users who cant view the report.p  pCan anyone suggest a way to make the report usable for those users that arent in the default list The reports are created programmatically so I do have a fair bit of control over the situation.p  pI would love to simply be able to mark a parameter in a linked report as no longer being querybased, but those properties are all readonly. I really, really dont want to have to create duplicate reports to accommodate these users but Im at a bit of a loss right now.p  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciatedp

The proc will then speed up considerably.p  pI think it has something to do with the cached plan and statistics, but I am not sure.  Is it that statistics get out of date as the database grows and changes so that the cached plan is optimized on a past state of the data which is different from the present state of the datap  pthanks.p

Negative 4682 pI have a bunch of sites set up on my local development environment. Out of those sites I have two sites where I experience horribly slow page load times. Horribly slow, like approximately 5 minutes. The thing is my computer mac pro osx 10.6, dual xeon nehalem processors, 6 gb of ddr3 memory is adequately equipped and the other sites load real quick. I know its not a programming issue because the slow sites are fast on their production servers. Also these sites are just straight up PHP and MySQL stuff, no advanced frameworks or anything. These sites are configured the same way as all the other quick sites on my local machine and the same as what Ive done on other dev environments where i havent experienced the same issue, same version of Zend Server CE, PHP, and OSX. This problem is severely affecting my productivity working on these sites. I sincerely hope you guys have some input Dp

I paid the developer for his work, but he never delivered what he promised so I am left to try and fix it. Anyway...p  pThe site uses some jquery to activate a drop down menu.

I need this menu to list the posts alphabetically and not chronologically. 2.

Negative 4682 pI have a ListActivity whose ArrayAdaptersubclass creates a droidfu WebImageView. The problem is that whenever the list grows longer than can be displayed on a single page, whatever it is that calls getView always starts from 0 and counts to 4 or 5 depending on whether or not partial rows are visible, even when its actually displaying an item like 12 or 14 at the top of the screen... but onClick registers properly.p  pPut another way, suppose the list has 27 rows in it, and I have the app littered with Log.d statements to document everything its doing. When the ListActivity begins, I can see it call getView with position  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. If I touch one of the rows, onClick fires with the correct position 0..4 5 is offscreen as well. So far, so good.p  pNow, flick the list upward by a few rows and watch the log output. Once again, getView gets called for position0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. But if I touch one of the rows, onClick fires for a position like 9 or 14 which, in fact, is correct.p  pIn other words, somewhere along the way, whatever is responsible for making the call to the ListAdapters getView method to render the list is forgetting about its current offset, and is always counting from 0 instead of from whatever row is, in fact, at the top of the screen.p  pDoes anybody have any idea where to even begin looking for what might be going wrong here Perhaps a clue about where those calls to getView are coming from, and how the value of the position arg used for that call is determined God forbid, is it possible to put a breakpoint at the start of getView, then step BACKWARDS with Eclipse to see where the call to the ArrayAdapters getView method came fromp  pUpdate forgot about github amp managed to get a copy of my program nowp  precodeprivate class ChatInfoAdapter extends ArrayAdapterltChatInfogt      private ArrayListltChatInfogt items      public ChatInfoAdapterContext context, int resourceID, ArrayListltChatInfogt items          supercontext, resourceID, items          this.items  items           hmmm... could THIS be the problem somehow              public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent          Log.dgetView, postion  position         View v  convertView         if vnull              LayoutInflater vi  LayoutInflater getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE             v  vi.inflateR.layout.row, null                   ChatInfo info  items.getposition            grabbing from local items, not superclass ArrayList.

Negative 4682 pIve worked with OpenCV in combination with Android before and what I always tried to do is to use as few calls as possible between my native code and my java code. When I look at the OpenCV a hrefhttpcode.google.compandroidopencv relnofollowporta for Android though, it seems like they just create a wrapper function for every native function and call these from java. Now unless I totally misunderstand the principal of swig wrappers and the whole idea of this port, wont this be a lot slower than doing the actual coding in native code I noticed that passing data between native code and java code is really slow, so  I dont get why it seems to be the most normal thing in this port.p  pI did use it myself, but I just decided to ignore all the wrappers and use the code as it is and create my own wrapper using the normal way presented by Android tutorials. p  pSo my question is, am I just wrong about the disadvantages Or are they actually there and what is the real advantage of using OpenCV in this was I know these questions are somewhat informal, but I hope you guys can help me out.  p

Negative 4682 pI have a list of integers, for example code1,2,2,3,4,1code.  I need to be able to check for equivalence  between different lists.p  pHowever, I do not mean a simple number wise comparison.  Each of these lists actually denotes a set partition, where the position in the list denotes the index of an element and the number denotes an index of the group. For example in the former, element 0 and element 5 are in the same group, element 1 and 2 are in the same group and element 3 and 4 are both in their own individual groups.  strongThe actual index of the group is not important, only the grouping.strongp  pI need to be able to test equivalence in this sense, so for example the previous list would be equivalent to code5,3,3,2,9,5,code since they have the same grouping.p  pThe way I have been doing this is reducing the array to a kind of normal form.  I find all numbers having the same value as the first number, and set these all to 0.

Negative 4682 pI have an MS Access application that links to a SQL Server 2008 db for all of its data.  For years, it has worked fine when the SQL Server was on Win2008 Standard 64bit SP2 and SQL Server 2008 v10.0.4.  I recently moved the backend SQL db to a newer server Win2008 R2 Standard 64bit and SQL v10.50.1600.  After the move, everything on the application worked just fine as expected, no issues.  However, we have a monthend process that generates relatively large reports 300500 pages which uncovered an issue that we dont normally see in our daytoday processing.p  pMy report is based on a passthrough query.  The query runs almost instantaneously and produces 8000 rows.  I can preview the query and quickly navigate to the end of the RS to see the 8000th row.  No problem.  If I pull up the report thats based on that query, I can see that there are 350 pages and I can navigate pagebypage through the report with no problem.  I can even type in a page number and jump to page 50, 100, 150, etc. with no problem. Note, there is no processingcodelogic happening on any fired events on the report  just displaying and formatting the data.  p  pHERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM OCCURS  If I preview the report and try to jump to the last page from the first page, itll sit and think for a while 38 seconds to be exact and then throw strongError 3151 ODBC Connection to [DNS Name] Failed.strong  p  pIf I simply update the connect string on the passthrough query to point it back to the older SQL Server and run the same thing, it works just fine.  Ive tried adjusting the connect string to use IP address instead of DNS name, no luck.  This is a process thats worked for years with no problem so I know the clientside logic is sound.p  pAny thoughts or suggestionsp

Negative 4682 pI need your help about performance problems running our corporate Java application on HPUX server. Application is standalone tool which synchronizes data over several data bases into one, communicates with remote control on XMLRPC protocol and uses local Derby Java DB data base instance to hold configuration data etc. We don not have performance problems on other environments on the same load like Windows XP, Linux and AIX which use Sun JVM. After series of test we found out that most time consuming was communication with Derby data base. Most time is spent on reading from socket and this time is greater in 10100 times than on other platforms. We know for sure that Derby works fine, weve got CPU reserve usage is about 3040, so most probable reason is transport layer between local data base and application. p  pIs there a way to diagnose socket IO problems on HPUX or maybe there is some possible limitations that can be configured Maybe there is necessary JVM option Any ideas from your side would be highly appreciated.p  pWeve tried to optimize JVM options according to a hrefhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenterwasinfov6r1index.jsptopiccom.ibm.websphere.wsfep.multiplatform.docinfoaeaetprftunejvmv61.html relnofollowhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenterwasinfov6r1index.jsptopiccom.ibm.websphere.wsfep.multiplatform.docinfoaeaetprftunejvmv61.htmla but didnt get any significant improvement.p  pJVM info Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM 19.1b02jinteg2011mar111646 PA2.0W aCCAP, mixed mode Java version 1.6.0.10, vendor HewlettPackard Companyp  pWe use following instance OS HPUX B.11.23 Architecture PARISC2.0W 64bit Processors 2p  pTotal physical memory size 4 088 MB Swap size 4 090 MBp  pHere is example of slow running code.

Negative 4682 pI need to automate the process of upgrading the existing deployments of an application to the latest stable revision of the application. I currently have a plan to do this by storing each change inside an upgrade application and then upgrading from a version to each new version in sequence until I arrive at the latest version. I would force all of my developers to add the upgrade code to the upgrade application each time we have a new stable release. This wouldnt be that complicated except for we have a MySQL database where the schema sometimes changes and we add stored procedures. Also, we usually have to swap out some binaries. The application consists of a Web Application and a Windows Service.p  pMy question is, is there an easier way to do this It seems to me that I should be able to package a Mercurial repository and automate pushing the changes to the deployed application.

Negative 4682 pAs Google App Engine will start and stop instances regularly, and this means incurring the cold start time regularly, Id like to configure my Spring MVC3 app using XML to avoid the 35 sec delay caused by scanning the class files for annotations when using annotation configuration when a new instance is spun up.p  pHowever writing the xml is a bit of a chore and much easier to use the annotations to define my configuration.  So Id like the best of both worlds and to use the annotations to generate the config file, and then turn off the scanning at runtime.  From a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5749041generatefullxmlconfigurationfromspring3annotationsthis questiona it seems there arent any existing tools that will do this.  p  pSo what is the best way to approach this  Presumably there is a class which does the scanning in spring at runtime that could be reappropriated to scan at design time and then spit out the xmlp  pAre there any limitations on things which can be done from the annotation configuration which will not be possible in the xml configurationp

I have found similar requests for help on this online, but the answers didnt seem to solve this problem.p  pThanks for any help you can provide Cp  pp  pAddition sorry, it wouldnt fit in the responsecomment boxesp  pThanks for your suggestions.  But if I have a class A which has another class B sitting in it as a field, and I want to 1 listen for changes in a field of class B say int var, and 2 detect these changes at the level of class A have the resulting event fire a method in class A, it is not obvious to me that this approach will work.  p  pFor if I put my listener in class A, I cant specify to listen for changes in B.var from here.  Conversely, if I put my listener in class B, which is a field of class A, then it will be able to detect changes in var, but how would I able to cause this to fire and make changes in class A, because B sits in class A as a field, and isnt aware of class As existencep  pOne solution would be to incorporate all of the fields and methods of B into A.  However, ultimately I would like to have B as a static class and have many different As, with each A listening to slightly different events in B.  The picture I have in mind in my head is of lots of different people listening to the ratio, which is broadcasting lots of different words.  Each person is watching for his own particular word to come from the radio, and each time their word occurs, they put a check on their wall or increment some field they have..p  pThanksp

Negative 4682 pId like some opinions on the practical implications of moving processing that would traditionally be done on the server to be handled instead by the client in a node.js web app.p  pExample case study The user uploads a CSV file containing a years worth of their bank statement entries. We want to parse the file, categorise each entry and calculate cumulative values for each category so that we can store the newly categorised statement in a db and display spending analysis to the user.p  pThe entries are categorised by matching strings in the descriptions.  There are many categories and many entries and it takes a fair amount of time to process.p  pIn our node.js server, we can happily free up the event loop whilst waiting for network responses and so on, but if there is any data crunching or similar processing, the server will be blocked from responding to requests, and this seems unavoidable.p  pTraditionally, the CSV file would be passed to the server, the server would process, save in db, and send back the output of the processing.p  pIt seems to make sense in our single threaded node.js server that this processing is handled by the browser, and the output displayed and sent to server to be stored. Of course the client will have to wait while this is done, but their processing will not be preventing the server from responding to requests from other clients.p  pIm interested to see if anyone has had experience build apps using this model. p  pSo, the question is.. are there any issues in getting browsers rather than the server to handle, wherever possible, any processing that will block the event loop Is this a goodsensibleviable approach to node.js application developmentp

Does a solution exist to this problem I initially considered using the codekeyPathcode argument codeaddObserverforKeyPathoptionscontextcode to call a method via codeNSSelectorFromStringcode, but then I came across the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4566922kvodispatcherpatternwithmethodascontextKVO Dispatcher pattern with Method as contexta and the article it linked to which offers a different solution in order to pass arguments along as well although I havent gotten that working yet.p  pI know a lot of people have come up against this issue.

Negative 4682 pIm writing C code trying to make a very basic proxy server for simply some networking practice. What my goal here is, is to just get a GET request from the browser using my proxy and then forward it to the appropriate server, get the information back from the server and then send all the data back to the browser. So far I got the first part to work, i.e. I got the contents of the GET command. Now Im really stuck on the forwarding part. How do i forward the contents of the GET to the place were its supposed to go, say www.example.com and get that information back I obviously cant use the same socket descriptor and try use a send command because then I would be sending the GET command back to the browser that was trying to send it out. Ive been using Beejs guide and random online tips. This isnt my first networking program but Im definitely stuck here. I thought I would have to do a DNS look up of the HOST which is in GET, get the IP and then use getaddrinfor  connect but then connect gives an error that connection is refused.

Negative 4682 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9658859iosdeveloperprogramcantgetacertificateiOS Developer Program  can39t get a certificatea  p blockquote    pSo I am trying to develop an iDevice application, and I cant seem to get a development certificate.  I am running XCode 4.3.1 and Mac OS X 10.7.3 and iOS 5.1.p  pFirst, Ive tried going to the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comiosmanageoverviewindex.action relnofollowiOS Provisioning Portala and using the Development Provisioning Assistant.  When I go through that using both Chrome and Safari, when I upload the CSR generated by going to Keychain Access  Certificate Assistant  Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority and then enter my Apple ID email, name, it hangs with a hrefhttptwitpic.com8v4oyn relnofollowWe were unable to generate your Provisioning Profile. Please try again or visit the Provisioning section of the Provisioning Portal.ap  pSo, then I figured Id try going to the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comiosmanagecertificatesteamindex.action relnofollowiOS Provisioning Portal  Certificates  Developmenta.  I download the WWDR intermediate certificate and double click on it, which I think installs it.  At least, it appears in my Keychain as Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority  Then I hit Request Certificate and note that it directs me with Important Xcode is the preferred method for requesting and automatically installing this certificate. Before proceeding, read a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationXcodeConceptualiosdevelopmentworkflow00AbouttheiOSApplicationDevelopmentWorkflowintroduction.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007959 relnofollowTools Workflow Guide for iOSa.  this will be important later.  I follow the directions, creating a CSR, which I then upload on that page.  When I hit Submit Im brought back to my Current Development Certificates, which excitingly, now reads a hrefhttptwitpic.com8v4w9s relnofollowPending Issuance.a  Lots of places on the rest of the internet a hrefhttpwww.jeroenvanwissen.nlweblogiphonehowtoiphoneapplicationdevelopmentenvironment relnofollowsay to just refresh the pagea and supposedly I should be done.  Except when I refresh, it just says I dont have any valid development certificates and presents me with a hrefhttptwitpic.com8v4xcu relnofollowthe first viewa, from which I can request a certificate.p  pSo, what about that link to the iOS Application Development Workflows  When you check that out and start to read through it, it says that If you are a team administrator or the team agent, provision your device for generic development. Xcode installs your development certificate in your keychain if its not there already, and installs the team provisioning profile on your device.  I dont have a teamIm an individualbut when I go to XCode to provision the device, I go to the Organizer  LIBRARY  Provisioning Profiles  Refresh.  Then, it asks me to sign in with my Apple ID, tells me No iOS Development Certificate Found and offers to Submit Request on my behalf  Hurray  Then I see it says Submitting CSR . . . Waiting for CSR Approval and it hangs there for awhile. . .then it says, Certificate Requested  A certificate request has been submitted on your behalf, but has not yet been approved. An Agent or Admin must approve this request before you can download your certificate.  Thats super cool, rightp  pExcept theres nowhere I can go to approve that request, and if I go to my a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comiosmanagecertificatesteamcertificateHistory.action relnofollowCertificate Historya I see a long, long history of Errors.  Except theyre not informative at all, because it just says Error.p  pSo at this point, Ive spent 8h trying to fix this.  Ive tried provisioning an iPad, iPhone, resetting my keychain, setting up XCode on a separate account, and of course updating and upgrading all the software.p  pLet me know if Ive left anything out.p

Negative 4682 pMy overall question is how to move an existing codeUIMangedDocumentcode with a core data sql store from the local sandbox to the iCloud.p  pEverything I am reading online is telling me to use codeNSFileManagercodes codesetUbiquitousitemAtURLdestinationURLerrorcode.  When doing this though, I noticed that codepersistantStorecode gets copied up to the cloud which I believe is wrong.  After thinking this throgh, I am starting to believe that I should create a new document in the cloud, and then manually insert the existing records because an existing database in the sandbox does not have any transaction logs.p  pSo, is my line of thinking correct, or is the codepersistantStorecode that is copied up there used as a starting point so if another device is connected, it downloads the codepersistantStorecode as a base and then applies any new transactions that occured after thatp  pA secondary related question just to confirm my understanding of how codeUIManagedDocumentcode works, if I were create a document in the cloud, add a record and update the same record 100,000 times, and then open this document on a new device, would it have to apply the 100,001 transactions to a new database  Seems like a document that is being used heavily is going to continue to consume space on the cloud even if the document has minimal data but lots of updates.p

Negative 4682 pSo I am working on a course syllabus app. Each syllabus has one or more class meeting times, a start date, an end date. I would like to be able to automatically generate a set of class meetings for each syllabus based on this information within the admin form. The idea is simply that the user should be able to input the meeting times, start date, and end date, hit a button, and have django create inline class session objects that the user can then edit. So, for instance, if I have a class that meets every Tuesday from 1  3 between May 1 and September 1, I should be able to hit a button, and get class sessionsor at least class session forms, theres no reason to save them in the database until theyre filled infor every Tuesday between those dates.p  pThe relevant model code is as followsp  precodeclass Syllabus models.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength120     number  models.CharFieldmaxlength32, blank  True       startdate  models.DateField     enddate  models.DateField  class DaysTimemodels.Model     days  MultiSelectFieldmaxlength15, choicesWEEKDAYS     startTime  models.TimeField     endTime  models.TimeField      class Meta         abstract  True  class ClassTimeDaysTime     key  models.ForeignKeySyllabus  class EventAbstract models.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength120     description  models.TextFieldblank  True     startDateTime  models.DateTimeField     endDateTime  models.DateTimeFieldblank  True      class Meta         abstractTrue  class ClassSessionEventAbstract     cancelled  models.BooleanFielddefault  False     syllabus  models.ForeignKeySyllabus     date  models.DateField codepre  pGenerating the dates and the ClassSessions for the dates isnt the problem. Adding a button onto a custom admin template to extend changeform isnt a problem either. Because the changeform is highly generic, and does not know anything about the models it is presenting, theres no way I can see to make the button talk to the function.p  pSo as I see it the problem is three foldp  ol liHow do I supply the recurring class times to the function that generates the new ClassSessionInlinesli liHow do I create them on the admin pageli liHow do I populate their fieldsli ol

I tried to set rotation of the camera object directly by the alphabetagamma converted to radian. But its not working since the camera seems to always rotate according to the world axis used by openGLwebGL not according to its local axis.p  pI came across the idea of rotate a point 100 unit in front the camera and rotate the point  relatively to the camera position by angles supplied by the device orientation API. But I dont know how to implement this either.p  pCan anyone help me with what I want to achievep  pEDIT p  pMISTAKE CORRECTIONp  pFor anyone interested in implementing similar things, I found out that Three.js objects uses local space axis by default, not world space axis, I was wrong. Though the official document stated that by setting object.matrixAutoUpdate  false and then modify object.matrixWorld and call object.updateWorldMatrix you can manually moverotatescale the object in world axis. However it does not work when the object has a parent, the local axis matrix will always be used when the object has a parent.p

Negative 4682 pAnother question for you Filemaker Pro experts. The database I am developing starts with a emMainem layout with a number of buttons e.g. insert new item, show all items, etc.. Each button is associated to a script, which takes the user to the relevant layout. In each of these layouts I show the buttons in a row, and highlight the current layout with inverse colour. My problem is that some of the buttons lead to the same layout, viewed in different modes, and I dont know how to conditionally highlight the right button. p  pFor instance, emInsert new itemem and emShow all itemsem take to the same layout, however in the first case the script views the layout as a form and inserts a new record, while in the second I view as a list and show all records. The layout is the same, though, so Id need to enact a conditional formatting based on something. How do I do that, and what should I check againstp  pThanks in advance for any help.p  pRegards.p

Negative 4682 pConsider the exponential smoother template class below. This class is for smoothingfiltering sequential data exponentially see update method. Elemtype might be an vector and Floattype is usually a scalar. E.g.p  precodeExponentialSmootherltEigenVector2f, floatgt x0.1, Vector2f0.5, 0.5 codepre  pIn this example the second template parameter Floattype could be avoided because Eigens Matrix class contains a nested typedef to get the scalar base typep  precodeVector2fScalar codepre  pIt is also reasonable to instantiate both Elemtype and Floatype as floats to smooth one dimensional data. In this case the second template paramater could also be skipped.p  precodetemplate ltclass Elemtype, class Floattypegt class ExponentialSmoother  public      ctor     ExponentialSmootherFloattype alpha, Elemtypeamp initialestimate       getters     inline const Elemtypeamp getValue const return estimate     inline const Floattype getAlpha const return alpha      const Elemtypeamp updateconst Elemtypeamp curr             estimate  alpha  curr  Floattype1alpha  estimate        return estimate       private     Elemtype estimate     Floattype alpha   smoothing factor within [0,1]  codepre  pNow my question is what is the most elegant solution to implement the ExponentialSmoother with only one template parameter the element type It should work with Eigen vectors and matrices but also with floating point types.p  pIn other words, is it possible to check if ElemtypeScalar exists and if not i.e. Elemtype is float or double define the Floattype as Elemtypep  pA similar question has been asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9644477howtocheckwhetheraclasshasspecifiednestedclassdefinationortypedefinherea. But I am wondering what the most generic solution is if for instance STL vectors should be supported as well.

Negative 4682 pFor simplifying discussion, I assume there is only one executing thread. The following are just my wild speculationsp  p1, If the CPU reads a byte from an address of memory, then it can repeatedly read the same value from the same address.p  p2, If the CPU reads a byte from a port repeatedly, then it may read a different value each time.p  pI think the difference between the two ways is that the port controller can strongautomatically update the valuestrong on the port after each read operation.p  pHowever, I could not find any text book explicitly supporting my statements. p  pAm I correctp
Negative 4682 pDoes ASP.NET MVC4 has anything to do with multibrowser compatibility limitations p  pIn other words the ASP.NET MVC engine also generates HTML server side which is displayed client side right, does it generate non multibrowser compatible HTML markup or do those two things have nothing to do with each otherp
Negative 4682 pIm getting an object disposed exception during a call to the ReadToEnd method from a client side method, getRecords, that communicates to a webserver using a StreamReader. p  pThe first call to getRecords succeeds, it is only during a subsequent call the exception occurs, and so Im not closing and disposing of the StreamReader and associated WebRequest properly.p  pIm aware that I could wrap these two objects in a using statement, however that just gets expanded into a trycatchfinally statement. As can be seen in my code below, Im cleaning up in my finally clause.p  pTherefore, strongIm either not doing something that the using statment does, or there is something else I may be missing in my finally statment.strong Id rather not using the using statment if at all possible, as I like my code explicit.p  pHere is the code and the associated exceptionp  precode    public int

Negative 4682 pI am trying to parse the JSON results from an AJAX call, but do to the limitations of the server I am only able to get one large string.

Negative 4682 pSo Im writing a function parse to read through a specified file line by line, and Im utilizing the String.splitregex function to break the line into a string array of words. Additionally, each word will be passed to a HashMap contained in another function passed as an argument to parse. While I have browsed Stack Overflow for anything to help, Im still not sure why my function is causing my program to hang. p  pHere is the function itselfp  precodepublic void parseFrequencyCounter counter throws IOException       BufferedReader fileReader  new BufferedReadernew FileReaderfile      String searchExpression  [pSpacepPunct]       String line     String[] wordList      line  fileReader.readLine      while line.isEmpty           wordList  line.splitsearchExpression           System.out.printlnFirst value of wordList   wordList[0]          for String each  wordList              ifeach.isEmpty                  break              ifcounter.isAnElementeach                  counter.incrementKeyeach              else                  counter.addKeyeach                                 fileReader.close  codepre  pSo I can get into the while loop just fine, but when add a println statement after the supposed construction of the wordList, the program infinitely prints out an empty wordList and the program does not return from the function. From my perspective, I am led to believe that the regular expression I am using does not achieve the ends I desire. p  pTo elaborate on what I need, the regular expression should isolate words made up of only alphabetical characters. In the perfect case, conjunctions or hyphenated words could be recognized in their entirety and added to the wordList. However, I can accept words like wont and twentytwo to become won, t, twenty, and two. p  pAs a test case, I am running a plaintext file containing the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll, though this does not contain very difficult nonword tokens to split around. p  pWhat is it that causes this issue, and how can I improve the parsing done by this functionp

Add corresponding Git modules to strongP1strong and strongP2strong, so every module will point to appropriate folder in emparentem project This will preserve the history for sure I think so at least.li liCreate repository for strongP1strong, checkin things into it. Then move modules strongB,Estrong to folder strongclientstrong, and then create import the folder strongclientstrong as module into strongP2strong repo.

However if the batch is called without arguments AND its being logged, then the batch file will just sit there forever waiting for a key to break the pause, but wont show anything on the screen.p  pNormally this wouldnt be a problem at all, however Im trying to make this idiotproof since I wont be the one implementing the batch file in other scriptsscheduled tasks.p  pAt this point it seems like I need to get rid of the usage pause entirely, but I was hoping for a solution where I wouldnt have to.  Thanks for the help.p

Negative 4682 pIve gone over the Tire documentation and I understand that its possible to create indexes and import objects into Elasticsearch using Tire without using the ActiveModel includes.p  pI would like to keep my model files completely clear of any Tire mappings and rather implement them separately.p  pSo far Ive created an indexing object for my Member model like this  p  precodeclass MemberIndexer   def initializemember     member  member   end    def attributes            id member.id,       name member.fullname,       age member.age,       birthday member.birthday,       type member     .tojson   end    def self.refreshindex     Tire.index members do       delete       create mappings          member            properties              id  type integer ,             name  type string, boost 5 ,             age  type integer ,             birthday  type date                                    Member.findinbatches do members         import members.map  m MemberIndexer.newm.attributes        end     end   end end codepre  pThis works fine and the index is created and I can search properly. What Im missing are callbacks that can be included by using codeTireModelCallbackscode. Is it possible to update individual records in the index using tire without needing to include codeTireModelCallbackscode in the model itselfp  pFor example, if I update a codeMembercode I want to manually be able to update the corresponding item in the members index. Is this possible without knowing the codeidcode for that item p  pShould I just do a search for the object using the ActiveRecord id and then use the update method on the index p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I was confused by the fact that ES was indexing the members not with the actual ActiveRecord id but by generating a unique id in ES even thought I was passing an id in the attributes json.p  pWhen I passed a ruby hash into the codeimportcode method the id field was respected and this problem went away as I can now just do the following to update an index recordp  precodeTire.indexmember do   storeMemberIndexer.newmember.attributes end codepre

However, it is unable to solve the puzzles which require more moves. p  pIve tried to get this to work in 3 different ways and all bring the same issue.p  pstrongAttempt 1strongp  precodewhile openList.Count gt 0                      PuzzleNode currentNode             var orderedOpenList  openList.OrderByPuzzleNode gt PuzzleNode.getPathCost              currentNode  orderedOpenList.First             if comparecurrentNode.getPuzzle, goalArray  true                              openList.RemoveAt0 POLL                 break                  otherwise push currentNode onto closedList amp remove from openList                          else                              openList.RemovecurrentNode                 closedList.AddcurrentNode                           generate all the neighbor nodes             generateSuccessorscurrentNode, tempList              for int i  0 i lt tempList.Count i                              PuzzleNode tempNode  tempList[i]                  skip the node if its in the closed list                 if closedList.ContainstempNode                                      continue                 end if                  We need to ensure that the G we have seen here is the shortest one                 int gScore  currentNode.getG  1                  if openList.ContainstempNode  gScore lt tempNode.getG                                      tempNode.setParentNodecurrentNode                     tempNode.setHtempNode.calcHcurrentHueristic, tempNode.getPuzzle, goalArray                     tempNode.setGgScore                     tempNode.updatePathCost                      if openList.ContainstempNode                                              openList.AddtempNode                     end if                   end if             end for          end while codepre  pstrongAttempt 2strongp  precodewhile openList.Count gt 0                      PuzzleNode currentNode  GetBestNodeFromOpenListopenList              openList.RemovecurrentNode             closedList.AddcurrentNode              generateSuccessorscurrentNode, tempList              foreach PuzzleNode successorNode in tempList                              if comparesuccessorNode.getPuzzle, goalArray  true                                      goto thebreak                     return successorNode                                  successorNode.setGcurrentNode.getG  1                 successorNode.setHsuccessorNode.calcHcurrentHueristic, successorNode.getPuzzle, goalArray                 successorNode.updatePathCost                   if OpenListHasBetterNodesuccessorNode, openList                     continue                  openList.AddsuccessorNode                      end while  private static PuzzleNode GetBestNodeFromOpenListIEnumerableltPuzzleNodegt openList              return openList.OrderByn gt n.getPathCost.First       private static bool OpenListHasBetterNodePuzzleNode successor, IEnumerableltPuzzleNodegt list              return list.FirstOrDefaultn gt n.getG.Equalssuccessor.getG                 ampamp n.getPathCost lt successor.getPathCost  null      codepre  pAttempt 2 is an alteration of an algorithm I found on the internet a hrefhttpwww.remondo.netsolving8puzzleproblemastaralgorithmcsharp relnofollowSolving the 8Puzzle Problemap  pHowever I done my best to follow the psuedocode on wikipediap  precodefunction Astart,goal      closedset  the empty set     The set of nodes already evaluated.      openset  start     The set of tentative nodes to be evaluated, initially containing the start node      camefrom  the empty map     The map of navigated nodes.       gscore[start]  0     Cost from start along best known path.

Negative 4682 pI started using Qt Designer a few weeks ago to generate some custom widgets for my PySide application. There is something I wish I could do, but I cannot manage to find how I would like to save all my widgets in only one big code.uicode, then compile them to only one big code.pycode file so that all the GUI details are in the same file, say codegui.pycode. That would allow me to write things like thisp  precodeimport gui.MainWindow import gui.FluffyRabbitWidget  class MainWindowgui.MainWindow pass class FluffyRabbitWidgetgui.FluffyRabbitWidget pass codepre  pThen I would not have to bother having a whole bunch of different files with Python code that I will never read since it is generated. So, how could I manage to have just one big code.uicode file And if not feasable, would there be a way to tell codepysideuiccode to generate only one code.pycode file with several code.uicode files as inputp

Negative 4682 h1Question Introh1  pIm running an opencv project in Visual Studios 2010 and have implemented cuda support refer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma160377682257078my previous questiona for precise info on my setup. All cudafunctionalities are working fine  to the best of my knowledge  and are indeed improving speed on the image processing. p  pHowever, I now also wanted to attemp to speed up the videowriting function in this project by replacing the current cvVideoWriter with the gpuVideoWriterGPU function. The reason for this is that the cvVideoWriter seems to somehow cause processes running emoutside of the scope in which the VideoWriter is calledem to be slowed down, resulting in images available at the DirectShow driver being dropped by the VideoCapturefunction, hence messing up an algorithm Ive implemented. p  h1Problemh1  pTo attempt to solve this issue, Ive now replaced the VideoWritercalls with VideoWriterGPUfunctionality and corresponding syntax, but when I run my project Compile amp Run in Debugmode, I get the following errormessage directly originating atthe calling of gpuVideoWriterGPUp  precodeOpenCv Error The functionfeature is not implemented The called functionality  is disabled for current build or platform in unknown function, file  cslavebuildswininstallermegapackopencvmodulesgpusrcprecomp.hpp, line 131. codepre  pand the program then ends withp  precode   code 529697949 0xe06d7363 codepre  pIve purposely currently not included any of my code because the errormessage originates so clearly from the call to the gpuVideoWriterGPU, which is making me think its not a coding or syntax problem. Please comment if you feel my code is necessary for answering this question.p  h1My steps so farh1  pI miss the natural gift of understanding what precisely this message means or how to interpret it. Does my opencv v2.4.4 simply not support what I want... Does this function simply not work on my windows 7, 64bit system...p  pIve checked out as many available googlehits I could find relating to this error message and combinations of searchterms like opencv, gpu, VideoWriterGPU, disabled for current build but have not understood what the problem is or how to solve it. p  pCorresponding headerfile and error message can also be found a hrefhttpfossies.orglinuxmiscOpenCV2.4.4a.tar.gz3aaopencv2.4.4modulesgpusrcprecomp.hpp relnofollowherea.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11175794opencvsurffunctionisnotimplementedThis posta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13246094opencv243javacv03facerecognizerclasslbphupdatefunctionstillthis posta suggest the error message is trying to tell me that opencv simply does not provide the option of using the function or functionality I am aiming to use. Or maybe even that cuda is not at all supported.. But thats all against my experience as every single opencv gpufunction Ive tried to use has seemed to work fine.p  h1Questionh1  pCould someone please explain to me why this is not working for me, and more importantly share with me what I should do to make the VideoWriterGPU workp  hr  pMany thanksp

Negative 4682 pContext On our website, we calculate whether an itemorder meets the criteria for free shipping using an if statement evaluating if a value  ff  is true. Depending on conditions met it sets the shipping appropriately. We now require the need to evaluate if an item is free shipping with the order of emem. To top it off, for other purposes such as external feeds, another condition must apply weight must  0 or have no value, for fw to be free freight. Here is the code, that I cant figure out why it is NOT workingp  precodeifr[freeFreight]  ff  r[freeFreight]  fw ampamp r[weight]  0  r[weight]          r[shippingStandard]  0  codepre  pAre the conditions overly segregated in the if statement with the sets of  Or, are they just incorrectly placed. For example, should it bep  precodeifr[freeFreight]  ff  r[freeFreight]  fw ampamp r[weight]  0  r[weight]         r[shippingStandard]  0                       codepre  pThe second of the two seems more logical to me because if r[freeFreight]  ff  then regardless of the following conditions the statement should return true and set the variable to 0. Is my logic correct Sorry for this newb question...p  pThanks for any help you can offer.p  hr  pSo I think perhaps, based on the answers so far thanks everybody that has chimed in to help an amateur  I think I am going to do a trial withp  precodeif r[freeFreight]  ff   r[freeFreight]  fw  ampamp empty r[weight]         r[shippingStandard]  0  codepre  pPlanning to run trial with this, if it is fundamentally wrong, please advise.p

Negative 4682 pI have a program for creating a time sheet and when a saved time sheet is loaded by clicking a button on form 1 the data loads to form 2 and then calls a method in form 2 to print the data to form 3.

If I remove codeForm2.Printcode the data is loaded on form 2 and i can then click the Print button and if i open form 2 again the data is still in the text boxes. NOTE Ideally I would just send the data to form 2 and form 3 from the Open button click event on form 1 but the codePrintcode method on form 2 does many things to the program other than just printing making it easier to just call it instead of replicating it in the Open click.

Negative 4682 pI have been playing with the new Admin SDK in conjunction with the upgraded authorisation experience and wondered if someone has and experienceexamples on how to use it. From what I have read, if you upgrade the authorisation experience you shouldnt need to use OAuth 2.0 and get a client ID and secret from the API console.p  pWhen you upgrade the authorisation, the API console entry is automatically created so you just have to turn on Admin SDK. Your app should then run simply using your own admin credentials. p  pHave I misunderstood this and if so, what is the benefit of the new authorisation experiencep  pI can use the Admin SDK just fine if I create a client ID and secret in the API console but this is using OAuth 2.0 then. p  pIf someone has an example of how to use the admin sdk with OAuth 1.0 i could have a look at it would be much appreciated.p

As a result, an event triggered explicitly in a Jasmine test will not be picked up by the DOM element in the fixture, because the function that would have bound that handler already ran at codedocument.readycode time.p  pIf only Jasmine could somehow delay the call to codedocument.readycode until after the fixtures were loaded, Id be golden.  But apparently it cant.p  pFrom the two StackOverflow questions above, Ive gleaned various ways to get around this, all unsatisfactoryp  ol lipCopy the binding code in codesetupcode into the HTML fixtures themselves.  This is nonDRY and almost certainly will cause the fixtures to drift out of sync with reality, plus the fixtures are supposed to represent unobtrusive JS and therefore not mix code and markup.pli lipExplicitly call the codesetupcode function in the test cases that require it.  This works in simple cases, but would fail if codesetupcode did nonidempotent things.pli lipIn codesetupcode, use something like codedocument.onclick, someDiv, someHandlercode instead of the code I showed above.  Im on jQuery 1.10.1.  I actually tried this but it doesnt work even if the loaded fixture contains an element matching codesomeDivcode, triggering click on that element doesnt result in codesomeHandlercode being called.  Even if it did work, its messy because if I understand correctly the value of codethiscode when the handler is called will reflect the element that actually handled the event, not necessarily the one that first received it.pli lipIn codesetupcode, use something like codesomeDiv.livesomeHandlercode, but codelivecode was deprecated as of jQuery 1.7 and removed in 1.9.pli ol  pIs there some other method Im missing that doesnt require making changes to working code solely to accommodate the testing environment and that doesnt require violating DRYp

Negative 4682 pI wanted to make an efficient pathfinding algorithm so I got into jump point search. I read the publication about it as well as online material. It explains the process very well, however, I couldnt find material on how it should be merged with A. For example, I am not sure if the algorithm ever tries to add the same node to the open list multiple times, since the algorithm is supposed to eliminate samelength symmetric paths. Should I do a check for that every time before I add a new node or should I add every jump point I find to the open listp  pSo in a nutshell, I would like to know how to handle the open and closed lists in a jump point search algorithm.p

I have added frameworks for OpenGL, Cocoa and IOKit and linked against libGLEW.a and libglfw3.a. The program compiles successfully but appears to crash when attempting to execute functions GLEW was supposed to take care of. Here, the program crashes on codeglClearBufferfvcode. If I comment that out, I get a window with a black background. My guess is GLEW is secretly not working, since it reports no errors but doesnt seem to be doing its job at all.p  pThe exact error message XCode throws at me is codeerror address doesnt contain a section that points to a section in a object filecode with an error code of codeEXCBADACCESScode. If I replace codeglClearBufferfvcode with codeglClearColorcode the program doesnt crash, but still has a black background when it should actually be red. When queried, OpenGL returns the version string code2.1 NVIDIA8.12.47 310.40.00.05f01code, which explains why calls to newer functions arent working, but shouldnt GLEW have set up the correct OpenGL context Moreover, GLFWs documentation says that theyve been creating OpenGL 3 contexts since GLFW 2.7.2. I really dont know what to do.p

Negative 4682 pIm using an NPAPI plugin that wraps an ActiveX control for use in ChromeFirefox. Neither of which I wrote.

For instance, if from JS I send...p  precodeGotoTime30, myPlayer  function GotoTimeposition, player      console.logTYPE   typeof position     o  document.getElementByIdplayer     console.logSeeking to  position     o.Seekposition  codepre  pIn Firefox and IE, it will cue media to the correct position 30 seconds in this case but in Chrome it seems to translate the value always as zero and play the clip from the beginning.p  pAs you can see from the function, Im confirming in the console log that I am actually passing a number and not a string, but I think maybe the NPAPI plugin is interpreting it maybe as a float instead of an int or vice versa. p  pIm 99 sure that this is an issue with the plugin and out of my control, Ive contacted the supplier but theyre not much help.

Negative 4682 pIm in need of a Rose Tree data structure like codescalaz.Treecode or the followingp  precodecase class Tree[A]root A, children Stream[Tree[A]] codepre  pHowever Im having a hard time understanding how to write a function for appending nodes. In general, I understand that appending a node involves rebuilding the tree, and doing that with immutable data structures requires recursive functions, but I just havent been able to put it all together. I did see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17511433scalatreeinserttailrecursionwithcomplexstructureScala Tree Insert Tail Recursion With Complex Structurea but since that involves binary trees, I didnt quite grasp how to implement it for a multiway tree.p  pTraditionally, I would implement this mutably using Array or such. Is there some book or resource that I should read to understand functional data structures more Or is there some example code that could be recommended for me to read overp

Negative 4682 pIve written a pretty standard Android app that displays a bunch of pictures from Contacts in a GridView. The app doesnt do anything special to try to retain data on screen orientation changes, and just recreates the GridView, adapter and loader when the Activity is recreated.p  pHowever, after a few orientation changes, the app slows down after a few more, it crashes with an outofmemory error at BitmapFactory.decodeStream. This still happens if I leave it sit for a minute between rotations to let the garbage collector do its thing.p  pI was under the impression that Android would free all memory associated with an Activity when the Acitivty is destroyed during orientation changes. However, this seems not to be the case. My question is what memory could I be inadvertently retaining despite Activity destructionp  pNote that the app runs fine so long as it is not subjected to too many orientation changes, so the general approaches to memory minimisation that Im using are sufficient.p

Negative 4682 pIm new to this forum and I apologise in the advance in case this question has already been solved somewhere else, I couldnt really find anything helpful. p  pIm coding a simple HTML template to be used on a dynamic platform where my clients can add the content by themselves. p  pThe template has 3 stories on the bottom part which must stay vertically alined no matter how long is the content of each story.p  pIdeally I would need the longer story to determinate the height of the entire block. p  pNo problem so far. p  pThe problems comes because due to the dynamic platform I need to keep the content of a single story within a specific dynamic tag and at the same time I need to find a way where the longest story determinate the height of the other two stories. p  pEDIT Just to clarify I need the Read More cell to be always alined to the bottom, the top picture always alined to the top while the title and the description cells height might vary. p  phere is the structure of my code.

Negative 4682 pOn Solaris 10 I have a multithreaded process with a  strange behaviour. It manages complicated C structures RWTVal or RWPtr. These structures are built from data stored in a database using ProC. Each hour the process looks for new informacion in database, builds new structures on memory and it frees older data. But, each time it repeats this procedure, the process memory usage increases several MB 1216MB.  Processs memory usage starts from 100M until near 1,4G.  Just to this point, it seems the process has memory leaks. But the strange behaviour is that after this point, the process stops to continue growing up anymore. When I try to look for memory leaks using Purify tool the process doesnt grow up and no significant leaks were showed. Did anyone found a similar behaviour or can explain what could be happeningp

Negative 4682 pSuppose I display a web page with thumbnails of my pictures all pictures are about 2M each.p  pIn order to display the thumbnails, I can just use codeimgcode tag with codemaxheightmaxwidthcode attributes. However I am afraid the browser will download the original pictures and scale them down in the client. It looks like waste of resources.p  pDoes it make sense to create the thumbnails in the server and load them rather than original pictures p  pOn the other hand, what if user clicks on thumbnail and I should display the original picture  Maybe I should load the original pictures in background and hide before the user clicks ... p  pWhat are the best practices to display images in a web pagep

Negative 4682 pIm working with codeControl.Lenscode. The actual function Im writing is rather complex, but for the purpose of this question, Ive boiled it down to a minimal failing examplep  precodeimport Control.Lens      exampleFunc  Lens s t a b gt String exampleFunc   Example codepre  pThis fails to compile, yielding the following error messagep  precodeIllegal polymorphic or qualified type Lens s t a b Perhaps you intended to use XRankNTypes or XRank2Types In the type signature for exampleFunc   exampleFunc  Lens s t a b gt String codepre  pWhy is this illegal It seems awfully similar to the following, which emdoesem compilep  precodeimport Data.Maybe  exampleFunc  Maybe s, t, a, b gt String exampleFunc   Example codepre  pSo Im assuming the difference lies in the definition of codeLenscode. But what about the codeLenscode type makes codeexampleFunccodes type illegal I have a sneaking suspicion it has to do with the codeFunctorcode qualification in the definition of codeLenscode, but I could be wrong. For reference, the a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagelens1.2docsControlLens.htmldefinitiona of codeLenscode isp  precodetype Lens s t a b  forall f. Functor f gt a gt f b gt s gt f t codepre  pSo, do I have to somehow satisfy the codeFunctorcode qualification in my definition of codeexampleFunccode If so, how Im not seeing where in my type signature I have the opportunity to declare this constraint. Or maybe Im on the wrong track, and my problem has nothing to do with the codeFunctorcode constraint.p  pIve read all the Stack Overflow questions I could find regarding the illegal polymorphic etc error message. Perhaps this is my lack of familiarity with Haskell showing, but I cant see any of those questions being applicable to my current situation.p  pNor have I been able to find any documentation on what the error message means in general.p

Negative 4682 pSome days ago I was developing an MFC Application which works as a client for a database of mine. In this application, there are some situations that some fields of a new record may be empty, which would represent a zero null when I fill some of the objects with data. So, in order to deal with these zero values, I was trying to create a trigger that would automatically substitute these zero values for a NULL, and so there wouldnt be any foreing key conflicts. Here is what Ive implemented so farp  precodeuse SomeDatabase SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO create trigger SomeTrigger on MyTable after insert, update as begin declare Attribute1 int declare Attribute2 int declare Attribute3 int declare Attribute4 int set Attribute1  select Slot1 from INSERTED set Attribute2  select Slot2 from INSERTED set Attribute3  select Slot3 from INSERTED set Attribute4  select Slot4 from INSERTED if Attribute1  0 begin TRANSACTION SET Slot1 NULL end if Attribute2  0 begin TRANSACTION SET Slot2 NULL end ifAttribute3  0 begin TRANSACTION SET Slot3 NULL end if Attribute4  0 begin TRANSACTION SET Slot4 NULL end end go codepre  pI am pretty sure there are better ways than this one, but I believe that the most curious thing is that SQL Server is accusing errors only at the last 2 ifs, and the last end and go. Does anyone knows a better solution for this Thanks in advancep
Negative 4682 pVery simple. I want to avoid the dragging of the first and last vertices. Ive tried using dragstart event, but apparently polyline doesnt listen to that one. p  pIve managed to do something with setat. I have the last position stored, when setat is called, I check the index of that vertex, and then set the latLng for that vertex to the old one. This was only possible using setAt function which fires the event again. p  pSo a created a ignoreNextEvent flag, so It wont go for an infinite loop. p  pproblem is, setAt function os used plenty of times by the maps api, and the solution, although works, is not perfect and I need to worry about ignoreNextEvent everytime Im interacting with the polyline. p  pIm trying to find a way to accomplish that, can anyone helpp  pThe working codep  precodegoogle.maps.event.addListenercable.getPath, setat, functione     ifignoreNextEvent         ife  0  e  cable.getPath.length1             var point  new google.maps.LatLngcable.Cable.vertex[e].latitude, cable.Cable.vertex[e].longitude             ignoreNextEvent  true             cable.getPath.setAte,point         else             ifcable.Cable.idx  0 saveCableindex, cable.Cable.destinationidx                 else         ignoreNextEvent  false       codepre

Negative 4682 pIm trying to add an iAD to a codeTableViewControllercode and its working fine if I add the Container View at the top of codeTableViewcode, and then in container I add an iAD. But I know, Apple will not accept Apps where iAD is scrolling, because of refreshing, etc... So I need to lock the container from scrolling at the top, but the table view must to be scrolling. So when I scroll up iAD scrollsup too..    p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNkP3D.png altViewp

Negative 4682 pI am trying to write a Bash script that can accept command line parameters in a nonPOSIX way. Specifically, I want to parse command line parameters in the standard way using codegetoptscode while emalsoem building a list of command line parameters emunexpectedem by codegetoptscode with its option string. Example command line parameter parsing in the way I describe is shown in code comments below. I am approaching a solution, but my script can identify only emuniqueem unexpected parameters, while I need to identify emallem unexpected parameters. I would appreciate guidance on solving this problem likely through clever AWK scripting. Thank you very much for any assistance.p  precodebinbash    This is a test of command line parameter parsing that is explicitly nonPOSIX.  This approach handles       options for getopts       arguments of options for getopts       positional arguments for getopts and       nonoption arguments command line parameters not expected by getopts.  All nonoption arguments are placed in the string nonoptionparameters. The  silent error reporting mode of getopts is required. Following command line  parameter parsing, input information can be accepted based on internal  priority assumptions.   example usage      .script.sh           nonoption parameters      .script.sh  a Dirac          a triggered with parameter Dirac          nonoption parameters       .script.sh a Dirac b          a triggered with parameter Dirac          b triggered          nonoption parameters       .script.sh a Dirac Feynman b          a triggered with parameter Dirac          b triggered          nonoption parameters Feynman       .script.sh a Dirac Feynman Born b          a triggered with parameter Dirac          b triggered          nonoption parameters Feynman Born       .script.sh a Dirac Feynman Born Born b          a triggered with parameter Dirac          b triggered          nonoption parameters Feynman Born    WANT      .script.sh a Dirac Feynman Born Born b          a triggered with parameter Dirac          b triggered          nonoption parameters Feynman Born Born    optionstringab nonoptionparameters  processarguments     OPTIND1     while getopts optionstring option do         case option in             a                 echo a triggered with parameter OPTARG gtamp2  output to STDERR                              b                 echo b triggered gtamp2  output to STDERR                                               echo invalid option OPTARG gtamp2  output to STDERR                      esac     done     shift expr OPTIND  1     echo    parameters while [  z parameters ] do     parametersprocessarguments parameters     TEMPecho parameters  awk F   print 1     ISPOSecho optionstring  sed s  sed s[azAZ] 1g  sed s[azAZ]1g  sed sg  awk v OPTIONTEMP               fori1 iltNF i             if matchi, OPTION 1 ampamp lengthi  lengthOPTION              print i                              wc l      The AWK code is quivalent to grep w OPTIONCHAR.

Negative 4682 pIm brand new to developing widgets for android so please bear with me if this is a stupid question.  Im writing my own mp3 player specific to my needs.  I have it working great as an app, but now Id like to pull it out into a homescreen widget as well more for the learning exercise than anything else.p  pI split out my mp3 player logic into a separate class, and when I try and intantiate an object from that class with a button click from my widget, it works fine.

Negative 4682 pMy use of the codeCryptocode library has gone very well, but I have a small question...p  pIf I use codeRSAESOAEPEncryptorcode amp codeRSAESOAEPDecryptorcode everything is fine. Im using a 2048bit key from PEM files generated by codeOpenSSLcode.p  pMy question is this Will the length of codeciphertextcode produced by codeencryptor.Encrypt...code always equal codedecryptor.FixedCiphertextLengthcode or can be be less than that I only ask as this is in a library used by a number of applications and I need to sanity check parameters.....p  pBTW. Is there any faster was to encryptdecrypt using RSA which maintains at least the same level of security provided by OAEP With a 1024 bit key, on an example test box, averaged over 1000 iterations, Im finding it takes about 80uS to encode a short string and 1.03mS 12 times longer to decrypt with a 2048bit key encryption takes 190uS and decryption, 4.3mS 22 times longer. I know that RSA decryption is slow, but.... the system is running XP Pro SP3Xeon E5520 and was compiled with VS2008 with MD rather than MT. I cant use a shorter key than 2048bits for compliance reasons...p  pMany thanksp  pNickp

Negative 4682 pWe want to rollout a new major release V2.0 of a .net application on windows via WIX.p  pThis rollout will be a permachine installation. Updates will be major updates e.g. V2.1,.... This mechanism works as expected.  When the product is updated it is replaced by the new version in the registry. However it doesnt replace previous version below V2.0.p  pPrevious versions of this product V1.0,V1.1,V1.5 were also installed with WIX, but in a different way. These were peruser installations. The product installers had a defined ProductCode.  Major upgrade installers had  set, so the product code changed for each upgrade installer. Every new upgrade resulted in a new registry entry. So after upgrading we had a version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 in the registry and the Remove programsdialogp  pWith version 2.0 however I want to clean up everything. All Version 1 installation should be removed.  The only thing that is common for all installers is the upgrade code. Unfortunately, versions v1.x stay untouched when running my V2.x installer.p  pIs there a way to achieve this with Wix natively or a custom actionp
Negative 4682 pOn the development of a onepagelayout Ive tried to create and use third party scripts to highlight the current menu item while page scrolls, basically using jQuery offset and scrollTop properties. Regardless of the tech involved, most of the solutions rely over a basic logic represented by this pseudoalgorithmp  precodeFOR EACH page section DO    IF scroll top gt page section top THEN       HIGHLIGHT THE RESPECTIVE MENU ITEM       BREAK      codepre  pThis works fine when you have large page sections, larger then your window height. But once you have smaller sections you can have a situation where two or more sections are displayed on your window. This is when this logic starts to fail, since it is desirable to highlight only one menu item at a time, never two. For instancep  ul liYou can click on a menu item, the page scrolls to it, but then the previousnext section is also displayed, leading your script to highlight an unexpected menu item.li liYou scroll somewhere along the the page expecting some menu item to be highlighted but the previousnext is chosen since their respective sections are being displayed as well.li ul  pI wonder if there is another pseudo algorithm considering the strongwindow heightstrong, the strongsection heightstrong, the strongscroll directionstrong, and some strongotherstrong geometric evaluation to chose the appropriate menu item to be highlighted considering that two or more sections are displayed on the window.p  pHere is some very basic code to test ideas a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netodon59dpS relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netodon59dpSap

For instance if i run this from the replp  precodego when not c second asyncalts [c asynctimeout 1000]        println hello codepre  pand then I reload the namespace and c is lost. Now I have hello spamming my REPL until the end of time. If I could close all channels or kill all go blocks it would save me restarting my REPL.p

Negative 4682 pAs part of an ongoing research work, I am checking if an URL exists or not using the codecURLcode command. I have been executing a shell script for couple of days and it is doing some updates for each URL in my database. However, the script seems to update around only 100,000 rows in a day. p  pI was thinking if I could write the values in a file first and then do the updates, the execution might be faster. p  pI am connecting to the database using the command line. p  precodemysql h servername u username ppassword databasename Update Query codepre  pFor example, instead of connecting to the database 2 million times like above from the command line and updating 2 million rows, I am planning to connect to the database only once from the command line and update 2 million rows from the file.  p  pSo is the second approach better than the first one or the time difference would be negligible p

Get familiar with the features of common.h  many of them are handy, and you will be required to use some of them in later steps.p      pPrint a neat table that shows each different input code, the corresponding character and its count, and print the total count at the end. Do not print any rows for ASCII codes that are not included in the input text.p      pYou must exactly match the format of our solutions basic results, and so you must use the symbols and functions defined in common.h.

Negative 4682 pI have got several Eclipse projects opened at the same time in my Eclipse workspace. I want to let all these projects opened as I often copypaste code from one project to another.p  pMy problem is that when I copypaste code, if a class does not exist in my current project, Eclipse adds an import from another project adding the line import com.theotherproject.ClassOfTheOtherproject in the header , it makes compile errors and I have to delete these imports...

Negative 4682 pIm using PHP and MySQLi and following a tutorialtype example and have some basic behavioral questions. A php code sample follows hm, hope I format it correctly, 1st post herep  precodeltphp db  new mysqlihostLiteral, userLiteral, passwordLiteral, people results  dbgtquerySELECT  FROM people ifresultsgtnumrows      whilerow  resultsgtfetchobject          records[]  row          resultsgtfree  gt codepre  pI used a DBMS many, many years ago and perhaps its that behavior thats keeping me from understanding this.p  pMy perception is that when the SELECT  FROM people is executed, MySQL would scan the entire database, get all the pertinent data, and end up pointing at the last record in the database.  So when the while loop begins, I would think thats where its starting, it would only get the last record or row and be done.p  pBut even if it did somehow start at the top of the database at the first row, how does it know to move through the database unless fetchobject is somehow telling it to move to the next rowp  pIm certain Im missing basic SQL behavior here.  But Ive not found a good explanation to dispel these concepts that were placed in my head years back.p  pThanks for any aid in understandingp

Negative 4682 pI already asked something similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18376138gettinggameidofpsxgameherea several months ago, but of course the solution used in my update is not good, because I dont know at which offset starts the file I want, that code reads the entire file until it finds the wanted string and thats not convenient. Thats why I searched for an ISO9660 File reader coded in Java and I came accross this a hrefhttpcode.google.compjpcspsourcebrowsetrunksrcjpcspfilesystemsumdisoUmdIsoReader.javar2186 relnofollowprojecta which reads perfectly ISO9660 files, but there are some file formats like codebincodeand codeimgcodethat Id like to be able to open.p  pUnfortunately, the code doesnt work because it expects the ISO9660 header codex01CD001x01code at a prefixed offset 32768, right after the first 16 sectors, reserved for other purposes as defined by the standard a hrefhttpalumnus.caltech.edupjeiso9660.html relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpusers.telenet.beit3.consultants.bvbahandoutsISO9960.html relnofollowhereap  blockquote   pstrong7. The First Sixteen Sectors are Emptystrongp      pThe first sixteen sectors sector numbers 0 to 15, inclusive contain nothing but zeros. ISO9660 does not define the contents of these sectors, but for DOS they are apparently always written as zeros. They are apparently reserved for use by systems that can be booted from a CDROM. p blockquote  pIn my case, i have codeimgcode and codebincodedisk images that have the codex01CD001x01code header at offset 37656, 792 bytes after the end of the 18th sector. This makes the code throw an error.  p  pSince there are softwares able to read the contents of a codebincodeand codeimgcodefile without the need of codecuecodeor codeccdcode file, whats the rule to fild the header in such cases Is it a standard or do they brutally search the header through the bytes If its a standard where can I find any kind of documentationimplementationp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found out that those files have a different sector size 2352 bytessector, because they are raw copies of the CDR. p

Negative 4682 pI have a .net webservice that services data updates to client applications. As part of the mechanism, we used an enum to differentiate between types of updates. So the webmethod returns a list of types that have an enum to define what the update is for. p  pWe recently added an additional update type to the system. While this worked fine for the new version of our client application also in .net, older versions threw errors as the new enum type which is serialized as a string and passed down the wire could not be cast to the enum as the enum value isnt specified in the generated code in Reference.cs.p  pOur answer is to avoid including that new value in the webmethods result to satisfy the older versions of the client app and use a new method for here on that instead passes the INT value of the enum to client applications.p  pIn terms of backward compatibility and robustness, is it a good idea to even pass Enum values when dealing with webservices We just had a new value to account for, but Im thinking in terms of refactoringrenaming enums for the future.p  pDefining the rule Dont pass enum values over webmethods. Pass their INT values instead seems like a really broad rule so Im not certain of the unintended consequences when supporting older versions of client applications.p

Negative 4682 pWe currently have an application ClientServer that communicates through WCF. We would like to move away from the WCF approach and use a REST approach instead.p  pThere are a few reasons for this, such as overhead in terms of size and the possibility to use the same access method for both our Windows client currently a WinForm client and mobile devices. We are also sometimes running the server on the Mono framework, and even though we have it up and running, we have seen some differences regarding how WCF is working on the Mono stack compared to the .NET Framework so I would not like to use the WebHTTPBinding in WCF to handle REST.p  pThe service also needs to be selfhosted i.e. not in IIS.p  pThe problem when shifting from WCF to other alternatives is related to contracts. I would like to make it possible to unit test the REST calls, and I would like a contract to be involved, enabling the clients to use proxy classes that they do not have to create by themselves  pretty much like WSDL.p  pThe main idea for handing out proxy classes to developers is that the clients should be able to rely on the service provider to get the correct proxy classes and that they should not need to care about the URLs used.p  pIs there any way this could be done automatically, and if so  using what framework or method Having looked brifely at WebAPI, I came across an example of generating a proxy a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comTips535260ProxyObjectGenerationforMVCandWebAPIControl relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comTips535260ProxyObjectGenerationforMVCandWebAPIControla. This would simplify for the developers, but would mean that I manually need to create the proxy for the developers to use.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated p

Negative 4682 pNow I understand this question may belong on Ask Different but I think it is appropriate for here because it pertains specifically to application development. Im downloading some GPS locations from a server which I know uses data but then I turn on location services and am notified when the location changes based on a threshold. I then check the previous locations GPS coordinates against a region I have set according to another set of coordinates. Does any of the above location services use data Does getting the users location andor receiving location updates use data If it does, does the threshold change the data usagep

Negative 4682 pI am not able to understand how banning works in Varnish. From the term and thinking of difference between purge and ban it seems thatp  ul lipurge invalidates cache and next request goes to backend and gets cached again. li liBAN , bans a url. as in it invalidates cache and not just next but all coming requests start going to backend.li ul  pPlease clarify.p  pAlso, banning algo is defined asp  pEach object in the cache always points to an entry on the banlist. This is the entry that they were last checked against. Whenever Varnish retrieves something from the cache, it checks if the objects pointer to the ban list is point to the top of the list. If it does not point to the top of the list, it will test the object against all new entries on the ban list and, if the object did not match any of them, update the pointer of the ban list.p  pIf anyone gets this..please explain. it will be very helpful.p

Negative 4682 pI emknowem this question has been asked a thousand times before, but for the life of me I cant find the answer I need.

Heres a somewhat crudely drawn illustration of what I needp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9gfYS.png altcustom atanfullp  pThe circle on the left is purely for showing which direction I want the angles to rotate, and from where they startend. The drawing on the right gives an example of the input I would supply to the code i.e., code0.3,0.17code. The green line is resulting angle.p  pThe reason I ask here and not on MathExchange is that my problem is directly a programming one that is, my question is this How do I find the angle between two points, as described above, in a programming language such as C or JavaScript In addition, the reason I do not state a specific language is that I know many and am capable of converting between any of them, which encourages more people to post a potentiallycorrect answer this is helpful to myself and any who come after me and find this question.p

Negative 4682 pSo I must say that all of the websocket tutorialsexamples appear to be so easy, but it seems you really have to dig to find really important pieces of information that are left out of the simple examples.  Im stil having quite a few issues with my webapp using the Spring 4 Stomp message broker with SockJS on the front end.p  pCurrently, if I add an endpoint to the StompEndpointRegistry without enabling SockJS, then declare my socket on the front end using dojos dojoxsocket, Firefox 28 will open a websocket just fine.  However, I need support in IE8 and IE9, so I switched to SockJS.  Using AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer, it took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to ensure all filters and servlets were set to use async very sparse documentation on the web for this.  Once I solved this, I can now get it to work in Firefox, but only using xhrstreaming.  With sessionCookieNeeded set to true, IE9 defaults to trying to use iframes for the connection, however, it failsp  precodeLOG Opening Web Socket...

I enabled the same origin x frame headers in spring security and Ive verified the headers are present in the requests, but it didnt help.  So Id like to be able to figure out how to A make Spring and SockJS properly negotiate using WebSocket transport in Firefox, and B get IE8 and 9 to properly use iframe transport so I can keep cookies.  p  pHeres my configcodep  pWeb app configp  precodepublic class WebAppInitializer extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer       Override     public void onStartupServletContext servletContext throws ServletException          super.onStartupservletContext         MapltString,  extends FilterRegistrationgt registrations  servletContext.getFilterRegistrations           Override     protected void customizeRegistrationServletRegistration.Dynamic registration           this is needed for async support for websocketssockjs         registration.setInitParameterdispatchOptionsRequest, true         registration.setAsyncSupportedtrue           Override     protected Classltgt[] getRootConfigClasses          return new Class[]SecurityConfig.class, Log4jConfig.class, PersistenceConfig.class, ServiceConfig.class           Override     protected Classltgt[] getServletConfigClasses           loading the Initializer class from the dispatcher servlet context ensures it only executes once,          as the ContextRefreshedEvent fires once from the root context and once from the dispatcher servlet context            return new Class[]SpringMvcConfig.class, WebSocketConfig.class           Override     protected String[] getServletMappings          return new String[]             rest,             index.html,             login.html,             admin.html,             index,             login,             admin                    Override     protected Filter[] getServletFilters          OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter openEntityManagerInViewFilter  new OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter         openEntityManagerInViewFilter.setBeanNameopenEntityManagerInViewFilter         openEntityManagerInViewFilter.setPersistenceUnitNameHSQL          CharacterEncodingFilter encodingFilter  new CharacterEncodingFilter         encodingFilter.setEncodingUTF8         encodingFilter.setForceEncodingtrue          return new javax.servlet.Filter[]openEntityManagerInViewFilter, encodingFilter        codepre  pSpring MVC configp  precodeConfiguration EnableWebMvc EnableGlobalMethodSecurityprePostEnabled  true, securedEnabled  true ComponentScanbasePackages  x.controllers   Only scan for controllers.

Negative 4682 pWould you be able to help me out here, pleasep  pIve got a column with varchar5 values like [hh]mm eg. 730, 1315, 1045, 900 etc. Im using datediff to calculate the time difference between those values. Everything goes smooth until a value grater than 2359 appears. I tried converting the column to time, datetime and so on but everytime i got the same result  the value is out of range.  Tried converting to decimal with no luck..  tried dateaddhour,0,value... im out of ideas. Please advice.p  pIm on MS SQL 2012p  pUPDATE sorry Guys, I didnt make myself clear about the problem. When I said time I meant duration not a specific time during the day. I store a time spend on some task. It might be 1 hour but it can even be 100 hours in total during a month lets say. In excel I would use [hh]mm format iso hhmm to get this. The [hh]mm from Excel is exactly what Im looking for in SQL but cannot find it. Is varchar5 an appropriate format to store such data p

Negative 4682 pMy DLL a.dll depends on another DLL b.dll, third party that has a relative path to an exe app.exe such that both a.dll and b.dll must live in the same directory as app.exe. However, I need a.dll to live elsewhere because it is loaded by another exe that only searches in a particular directory. If a.dll lives anywhere else than where b.dll and app.exe live, and I include a reference to b.dll, then I get a file not found error referring to app.exe. Thus, it appears the path of the invoking thread is the one used for a relative path to app.exe.p  pb.dll is used to drive app.exe, which is a proprietary application that talks to some robotics in a closedsource language. I cannot change this.p  pIs it possible to handle this in any way besides making a server that lives where app.exe lives and that communicates with my code from where it needs to live For example, is it possible to essentially change the working directory of the imported b.dllp

Negative 4682 pI have an algorithm written as follows but I need to write that code into R. I have included the algorithm and the R code. I am not sure if that is represented well enough. To write the R code in the sequential order is not straight forward. I am sorry for not providing all the values of the variables here. I am not sure of the output yet which is the reason I am unable to show the required.

Negative 4682 pIm trying to figure out the best way to use JPA in the context of a restful web service. The input comes in as JSON and I can use JacksonJAXRS to convert that to a POJO. This gets passed to a service where I need to somehow merge into a JPA entity.p  pThese are the options Ive found so far with pros and cons.p  pstrong1. JPA mergestrongbr The first thing I tried was probably the simplest. The GET action returns the JPA entity which is easily serialized into JSON. On the update the object is passed back is JSON which can be used to populate a detached entity. This can be saved to the DB using the JPA merge method.p  pstrongemProsemstrongbr Simple architecture with less code duplication i.e. no DTOsp  pstrongemConsemstrongbr As far as I can tell this only works if you pass the whole model around. If you try to hide certain fields, like the maybe the password on a User entity, then the merge thinks youre trying to set these fields to null in the DB. Not goodp  pstrong2. DTOs using JPA find and dozerstrongbr Next I thought Id look at using data transfer objects. Apparently an antipattern but worth a look. The service now creates a DTO instance based on the entity and it is this DTO that is serialized to JSON. The update then gets the entity from the DB using a find method and the values need to be copied across from the DTO to the entity. I tried automating this mapping using the dozer framework.p  pstrongemProsemstrongbr You dont have to return the entire model. If you have certain fields you dont want to be updated you can leave them off the DTO and they cant be copied to the entity by mistake. Using dozer means you dont have to manually copy attributes from dto to entity and vice versa.p  pstrongemConsemstrongbr It feels like repeating yourself when writing the DTOs. Somehow you have to map between entities and DTOs. I tried to automate this with dozer but it was a bit disappointing. It was nulling out things it shouldnt have been and to get full control you have to write xml.p  pstrong3. DTOs using manual mergestrongbr A third way would be to abandon dozer and just copy the properties across from the DTO to the entity in the service. Everybody seems to say antipattern but its pretty much how every nontrivial application that Ive seen in the past has worked.p  pstrongSummarystrongbr It seems to be a decision between keeping things simple for the developer but not having control over the inputoutput or making a more robust web service but having to use an antipattern in the process...p  pHave I missed anything Perhaps theres an elusive alternativep

Negative 4682 pHi wise sages of the StackOverflow universe. I was hoping you might be able to assist me with an issue Im having.p  pThe point of the code below is to show whether the symbol will solicit a valid response from the yahoo API.p  pThe function GetSymbol takes a double and returns a string, in the case of GetSymbol6149 the string returned is IBM.

Negative 4682 pIve been using a hrefhttpwineskin.urgesoftware.comtikiindex.php relnofollowWineskina for quite a while, and, as of late, Ive been attempting to use Winemac.drv or Mac Driver from a hrefhttpswww.codeweavers.com relnofollowCodeWeaversa more than X11. The main difference is that Winemac is fully programmed in ObjectiveC including its Window system, while the X11 approach uses X11 dylibs and .nib files for windows.p  pSince Winemacs still in development, however, it lacks in some OS X functionality. The feature in mind is bouncing on Dock. Whats the problem with the bouncing Well, it simply strongemjust doesnt bounceemstrong. More specifically at launch. The code somehow overrides the users option for Animating apps on launch, or does something that completely ignores the usual app launching animation.p  pIve still very little experience in ObjectiveC, so I mightve missed some key documentation from Apples Mac Documentation Library, but my question isbr Can apps usually override this option, or might this be the case just for Wine If they can, howp  pEDIT Ive stated incorrectly that the Mac Driver missed on functionality, when the reality is, as mentioned by Ken Thomases, that Wine processes start at background, so no icon is shown on the Dock at launch, and that means emno animationem.p

Negative 4682 pI am using OpenCV 2.4.8 to create an Application which will detect the Guns. The application will be deployed on Raspberry Pi. An LEDBuzzer is also connected to the Raspberry Pi. If the Gun is detected, the LEDBuzzer should be turned on according to some specific condition. I have attached the relevant code. The problem is, how to tell the code that whether the gun is detected or not I mean, the detected gun is shown by a bounding box. Now, how to use that Bounding Box in IFCondition I have commented out the desired lines in the code, like what I want to do actually.

Negative 4682 pIve got a pretty specific issue Im running into and the theme developer has gone MIA.  p  pI have linked a screencap of what the issue is and Ill try and describe it as best as possible here, too. If more info is needed, just let me know and Ill provide as much as possible. p  pScreencap a hrefhttptinypic.comr53le1l8 relnofollowhttptinypic.comr53le1l8ap  pIm using a pretty modified version of this theme, but nothing that should have an affect on the functionality of the theme p  pa hrefhttpwww.themes.redsundesign.comthemelemonchili relnofollowhttpwww.themes.redsundesign.comthemelemonchiliap  pAs you can see  the homepage is designed to display widgets, each in their own container, as opposed to a custom page layout were ignoring the top slider as that isnt an issue. The widgets that are included in the theme work just fine and size correctly with whatever content is displayed.  p  phomepage layer structure is from back to front background image  sidebarmenu amp page background page content slider and widgetsp  pThe issue is, with thirdparty widgetsplugins and pretty much any interactive content, those containers do not expand correctly and end up leaving the majority of the content not visible.  p  pIm using the plugin EventON www.myeventon.com and if a month has 2 events, as shown in the screencap, it displays fine.  NOTE when an event is clickedselected a lightbox pops up with event info  this isnt an issue  But if a month has 2 events, the box resizes to display the info, but does not resize to fit everything else on the page.  p  pIf you look at the original theme demo, each box has spacing between each widget.  p  pWhen you look at the screencap, youll see that the spacing goes away and the extra events are Im assuming being displayed underneath the widget below the eventON widget.  p  pWhat I need is to make each of those containers responsive to the content that is being displayed in each one, regardless of the placement on the page while maintaining the same spacing between each widget container.  Also, the actual page background needs to expand to meet content too, which doesnt seem to happen.  p  pIve been trying to find a fix for about a week and am completely stuck.br Does all of that make sense  if this is confusing or if Im not explaining it correctly, let me know.p  pThanks. p

Negative 4682 pI am using a subquery predicate to perform a fetch on a core data managed object context to fetch entities to put on a map. The entities are filtered by attributes on a related entity, so a subquery is used. The predicate on the subquery varies depending on the user selected filter criteria. Im finding that one of the simplest of these subquery predicates is causing the fetch to take exponentially longer than it should.p  pMy simplified object graph looks like thisp  precodeEntity  ltgtgt  RelatedEntity  ltltgt  FilterRelationship latitude longitude codepre  pThe predicate on the codeNSFetchRequestcode looks like thisp  pcodelatitude gt . AND latitude lt . AND longitude gt . AND longitude lt . AND SUBQUERYrelatedEntities, relatedEntity, relatedEntity.filterRelationship IN  JUSTONEHERE .count gt 0codep  pcodeJUSTONEHEREcode represents when there is only a single entity in the set in this portion of the subquery predicate, this is where the query takes exponentially longer. If I have more than one entity in this set, the query executes normally.p  pUsing the launch argument codecom.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1code, I logged the followingp  blockquote   pCoreData sql SELECT  t0.ZENT, t0.ZPK, t0.ZOPT, ... FROM ZENTITY t0 WHERE  t0.ZLATITUDE   AND  t0.ZLATITUDE lt  AND  t0.ZLONGITUDE   AND  t0.ZLONGITUDE lt  AND SELECT COUNTt1.ZPK FROM ZRELATEDENTITY t1 WHERE t0.ZPK  t1.ZENTITY AND  t1.ZFILTERRELATIONSHIP IN  strongstrong     ORDER BY ...

LIMIT 50p      pCoreData annotation sql connection fetch time 1.7181sp      pCoreData annotation total fetch execution time 1.7216s for 50 rows.p blockquote  pI removed the unimportant parts with code...code and renamed the entities to be clear what they are. But as you can see, the query is fetching entities of type codeEntitycode based on their longitude and latitude on the map as well as a subquery based on a related entity codeRelatedEntitycode and a predicate matching a relationship on these related entities to a specified codeFilterRelationshipcode entity.p  pIn the simple case of only having one codeFilterRelationshipcode entity in the set in the subquery predicate, the fetch takes 15 minutes.p  pThe only difference between the two above queries is the second one has two codeFilterRelationshipcode entities in the set in the subquery predicate. The second example completed in under 2 seconds.p  pThe database contains 22,000 codeEntitycode, 5,000 codeRelatedEntitycode, and 3 codeFilterRelationshipcode entities.p  pI also tried this same predicate except for using an equality predicate in place of the codeINcode a set of one object.p  pcodelatitude gt . AND latitude lt . AND longitude gt . AND longitude lt . AND SUBQUERYrelatedEntities, relatedEntity, relatedEntity.filterRelationship  JUSTONEHERE.count gt 0codep  pThis predicate had the same slow fetch result.p  pThe smaller the set of codeEntitycodes that are searched, the faster the subquery predicate fetch executes. So by zooming in on a small area of the map and having the latitudelongitude predicate filter out the codeEntitycodes being searched, the fetch executes faster, despite the slowness of a single codeFilterRelationshipcode. The 15 minute numbers were measure when zoomed all the way out on the map, filtering on all the codeEntitycodes in the database.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI updated the object graph to reflect that the first relationship, codeEntitycode to codeRelatedEntitycode is a one to many relationship. The second relationship, codeRelatedEntitycode to codeFilterRelationshipcode is a many to one relationship.p

But I understand now that directly writing it to the registry does not do the needful anymore and the extension is not installed and no policy is found under chromepolicy. p  pPlease help me with the solution Or if the registry entry needs to be through group policy, how can I do thatp  pstrongemEditemstrong I was going through the following links, one is a hrefhttpssupport.google.comchromeaanswer188446hlen relnofollowherea, and came to know little further about the two types of policies, machine policy and cloudbased policy. I need to know the machine policy way and that to programmatically, so that I can distribute my .msi package built through WiX to my users for installation on their machines. My .msi package should silently force install the chrome extension being hosted on chrome web store through group policy, so that it will be nonremovable and the extension will work for any user strongregardless of their being signed in into chromestrong.p  pFinding the solution would be of great help for me. To do this, I can learn whatever I need to. Please help.p

Negative 4682 pI am currently trying to detect heads in a sequence of realfootage images and am using HOG feature descriptor and SVM as classifier.p  pCurrently I am using strongDalals HOG implementationstrong code in MATLAB found in this link a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralfileexchange46408histogramoforientedgradientshogcodeusingmatlab relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralfileexchange46408histogramoforientedgradientshogcodeusingmatlabap  pCurrently I am using stronglibSVM MATLABstrong version found in this link a hrefhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvm relnofollowhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvmap  pI prepared 350 positive training images and 1243 negative training images.p  pThe hog feature vectors extracted from the training images are converted to libsvmFormat and inputted in the libsvm training method, to obtain a model. The hog vector length is that of 1764.p  pRegarding the libSVM I chose these as parametersp  ul licodes 0  i.e. CSVCcodeli licodec 1  i.e. cost  1codeli licodet 2  i.e. kernel  RBFcodeli licodeg 3  i.e. gamma  3 this is for kernelcodeli ul  pRegarding the HOG version, I left the cell, bin amp block parameters as they were in the implementation shown in the link above.p  pI am using a scanning window of size 128x128 and 256x256 to scan through the whole image to detect possible heads.  At each window, the hog feature vector is extracted for each image and is inputted in libsvm predict, to test whether it should be classified as a head or not.p  pHowever, after doing all the above, I have a numerous amount of false negatives and cant figure out what I am doing wrong. p  pCan someone experience please offer some advice on what is possibly wrong  I really need to figure this out please.  Much appreciatedp

Each wagon has a value for strongvolumestrong, which mustnt be exceeded by the sum value of the cargoes in  wagon strongat all timestrong. Each cargo also has a value for strongvolumestrong. Wagons are linked in Doubly Linked List and so are the cargoes in each wagon. The task is to move cargoes from wagon to wagon so that in the end we have the least amount of filled wagons. p  pcondition You can only move a cargo to the wagon on the right or to the left.p  pCan this problem be linked to any known programming algorithm, because I really dont want a solution using permutations and going through all possible movesp  pThe task starts with you receiving an unknown train. The first step would be that you go trough Doubly Linked List of wagons so that you know the number of wagons and in each wagon you should go trough Doubly Linked List of cargoes so that you know whit what composition youre dealing with.  p

Thus it is like XY1Z1, XY2Z2, XY3Z3...XY11Z11 Z1 to Z11 are fixed values like 0.05, 0.1...,0.95 which are repeated equal to the length of X and Y.p  pI have already plotted this data as 11 discrete contour lines stacked one above other in 3D space using plot3 hold on. But, I want to create surface  out of it. I think I can use interpolation using griddata but I didnt understand how to approach this problem. Can anybody help p

So right now, I have all the graphs working on each side however the ones that arent shown  initially seem to collapse to a minimum width, so when I show them they have like 15px width.

Negative 4682 pThe File IO API in Phobos is relatively easy to use, but right now I feel like its not very well integrated with Ds range interface.p  pI could create a range delimiting the full contents by reading the entire file into an arrayp  precodeimport std.file auto mydata  castubyte[] readfilename processDatamydata  takes a range of ubytes codepre  pBut this eager evaluation of the data might be undesired if I only want to retrieve a files header, for example. The codeupTocode parameter doesnt solve this issue if the files format assumes a variablelength header or any other element we wish to retrieve. It could even be in the middle of the file, and codereadcode forces me to read all of the file up to that point.p  pBut indeed, there are alternatives. codereadfcode, codereadlncode, codebyLinecode and most particularly codebyChunkcode let me retrieve pieces of data until I reach the end of the file, or just when I want to stop reading the file.p  precodeimport std.stdio File filefilename auto chunkRange  file.byChunk1000  a range of ubyte[]s processDatachunkRange  oops not expecting chunks codepre  pBut now I have introduced the complexity of dealing with fixed size chunks of data, rather than a continuous range of bytes.p  pSo how can I create a simple input range of bytes from a file that is lazy evaluated, either by characters or by small chunks to reduce the number of reads Can the range in the second example be seamlessly encapsulated in a way that the data can be processed like in the first examplep

Negative 4682 pIm using the following implementation of blowfish with some stuff cut out of the middle to encrypt and decrypt messages. I am attempting to encrypt a message on a big endian machine SunOS 5.10, and then send it over a socket to a little endian machine linux. I can encrypt and decrypt on the same machine, and on different linux machines, but I cant get it to work between these two machines.p  pBecause the blowfish implementation seems to break the message up into DWords, each of which contains two 32 bit integers, I have been breaking my encrypted message into 32 bit integers, applying htonl to each, sending them over the network, applying ntohl to each, and then attempting to decrypt. The result is not pretty, but interestingly enough, most of the correct characters are present after decryption, but they are garbled and some extra garbage characters appear in some places.

Negative 4682 pThe situation. I use osgi and I have javaee server and standalone rmi client. And I have some modulecomponent codetestmecode. So I have three bundlesp  ol lifor server testme.AClass, testme.ZClassli lishared  contains ejb interface and DTO. testMe.TClass,testme.BClassli liclient testme.GClass, testme.KClassli ol  pIn this situation there are three packages, which have classes about codetestmecode module. Of course every osgi bundle is a separate maven project.p  pThe problem  when I have some error in log its difficult to understand at what bundle the class is located. So, maybe should I define the name of the jar as the beginning of the package. I mean should I name these 3 jar files like this codecom.example.svr,com.example.shd,com.example.cltcode and the full name of classes would be like codecom.example.svr.testme.AClasscode. Using such naming approach I always understand from logs what osgi bundle  maven project has problems. However I dont see such practise using foreign libs. Is it normalp

Negative 4682 pIm struggling with the security components of symfony. I want to achieve an authentication, based on a third party cookie andor a traditional login form. A little more in detail First of all the application should check if the user has a cookie from an other application in our environment. In this case the app recognizes the cookie, validates it against an external api and the user is authenticated, if the session in the external api is valid. If it is not valid or the user has not such cookie the application forwards the request to the normal login form. I already tried a lot ways to implement this behaviour, beginning with a custom login form authentication provider, through custom listeners, etc.p  pCurrently Im trying it with two separated security factories.

Negative 4682 h1Backgroundh1  pIm working on a project which is written in C and ASP.Net. Its webbased and the sole purpose of the project is pretty much to generate reports.p  pThere are about 350 reports which you can navigate to through a report tree that which is like a folder tree on a typical windows machine. p  pEach of these reports has pretty much the same structure where when you visit the report page youre provided a navigation style bar at the top which presents a myriad of different dropdowns. When you drill down through the drop down the user may or may not be presented with another dropdown to further specify the report they want. Once the dropdowns have all be selected the user clicks Generate Report. A loading screen shows for a few seconds to low minutes while the report is generated and then the report is loaded.p  h1What Im Afterh1  pWhat Id like to know is if there is some kind of framework that exists for testing a situation similar to this.

So i created an append query to create a table containing details of all the tenants. And I changed the relationship so that the payment table is related to the email address from all tenants table. Now using the Form, if i try to add a record using the form, it shows You cant go to the specified record and if i try to edit the records, it displays The record set is not updateable. But i can add and edit record using the table. This problem only exists when i try to include the Name of Tenant, Tenants Contact Information or any other field from the All Tenants Table in the form. How can i fix thisp  pNote The email address in All tenants contains duplicate records due to different Check out and Check in date. Except those, all other records are same.p

Negative 4682 pIm having a weird problem with timers. As long as I know, the interval property of a timer indicates the delay between loops in which the timerTick event will be fired.p  pI had this problem with the exact signature 15 and 16 milliseconds delay before while programming in Visual Basic. Any timers that I create, fire their tick event with 15 or 16 milliseconds delay. For instance, if I set the interval of my timer to 1 which means its tick event should get fired 1000 times in 1 second, the event instead gets fired 62 to 66 times in 1 second thats 100016 to 100015.p  pIve been developing VB applications since 5 years ago and always had this problem that also means I had this problem on several different systems with both AMD and Intel processors, and now Im having it again with C.p  pId managed to do a workaround and solve this problem by calculating the time difference between each time the tick event gets fired based on TickCount method GetTickCount API in VB and Environment.TickCount in C.p  pTickCount is the amount of milliseconds passed since the time system had started.p  pTo understand the problem better, I created a windows application that counts the seconds since it gets executed like a timer. It relies on both TickCount and ordinary addition on each time the Tick event gets fired. It also calculates the delay of the timer by subtracting the last value of TickCount from the current value of the TickCount if the timer would have been fired 1000 times in 1 second truly, then the difference of the TickCounts would be 1 each time, thus meaning theres no delay, but if the difference is more than 1, then there is some delay between each times the timers tick event gets fired.p  pHeres the codep  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      int localTime  0, systemTime  0, baseSystemTime  0, lastSystemTime  0     public Form1              InitializeComponent           private void timer1Tickobject sender, EventArgs e               Calculate time based on TickCount         if baseSystemTime  0             baseSystemTime  Environment.TickCount          systemTime  Environment.TickCount  baseSystemTime         label2.Text System Time   systemTime  1000  60.ToString    systemTime  1000  60.ToString           Calculate time based on timer1Tick         localTime         label1.Text  Application Time   localTime  1000  60.ToString    localTime  1000  60.ToString           Calculate the delay         if lastSystemTime gt 0                      label3.Text  Delay   Environment.TickCount  lastSystemTime.ToString   ms                   lastSystemTime  Environment.TickCount       codepre  pIve also uploaded the whole solution here a hrefhttpramt.intestTimerDelay.zip relnofollowhttpramt.intestTimerDelay.zipap  pHeres a screenshot of the application with 15 milliseconds delay and 1 second counted by application while 17 seconds have actually passedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYbYEo.jpg altScreen Shotp  pThe solution is only 50kb, so feel free to download it and run it to see if you get the same result as me.

Negative 4682 pIm working on a program feature in which a FlowLayoutPanel whose flow direction is set to TopDown should adjust its width based on whether or not the vertical scrollbar is visible on the screen. I have figured out how to detect if the scrollbar is visible.p  pMy problem is that I cant seem to figure out how to find the width of the preprogrammed vertical scrollbar. The reason that I want to expand the panels width when it overflows is because the scrollbar overlaps the controls in the panel.p  pIf possible, Id like to avoid changing the marginpadding of the controls, and I would like to avoid using constants that I declare myself in my code.p  pId also like to avoid adding a VerticalScrollBar component, unless there is an easy way to programmatically scroll through the overflown panel based on the scrollbars thumb position.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas Thanksp

First of all, I can decide how to store data into JSON for datatables, accessing with field names or with table prefix  field namesp  precode.dt.DataTable    bServerSide true,    sAjaxSource itemsshow,    sAjaxDataProp data,    columns [         data m.id ,         data m.date ,         data m.type ,     etc ....  codepre  pThats ok, but when I try to search some values for type field I must write the whole procedure for processing sSearch, sSearch0, sSearch1 ... mField1, mField2, etc ... We all well know, programmers are lazy sort of people and we like to make something nonrepetitive and intuitive and something that can be used more than once. p  pThats not a problem, but this is not unique task so I can write code and fertig, there are more situations where this must be used, same scenarios etc...p  pIm wondering is there a something better than this, because Im using datatables for admin backend in portal but I find its a beast with single table Users, Rules, Topics... etc. This is really complex solution and Im interested in your solutions for such a problems.p  pIs there a different solution for this type of tasks besides datatables plugin.p  pProblems like this can be done with datatables but in variant to put data in DOM, sop  precodelttrgt foreach records as rec      lttdgtrecgtidlttdgt     lttdgtrecgtnamelttdgt     if bla bla bla        lttdgtsome valuelttdgt     ...     etc ...    lttrgt codepre  pand then initialise datatables on this table object. Search is now locally in DOM and everything is ok. This is great solution for small amount of data, but I must handle 1.000.000 or more rows and because of that Im choosing server side processing.p  pThanks p

Negative 4682 pThis is a followup to a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions30399773ffscerrorfs2024staticlinkingmaynotuseassemblythattargetsdifferenmy post yesterdaya. To recap, I received this error message when trying to build my projectp  blockquote   pFSC Error FS2024 Static linking may not use assembly that targets   different profilep blockquote  pI consulted some kind people in the F a hrefhttpfpchat.com relnofollowfpchat.coma channel, and one of them suggested that the error could be due to the fact that I did not have Profile 47, because FSharp.Data uses Profile 47. I tried downloading the target pack for Profile 47, but was redirected to the Microsoft homepage instead. I tried the second answer on a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions14935479missingtargetingpackfornetframeworkversionv40profileprofile47this SO pagea, but that did not work either. As of now, I am still unable to acquire Profile 47.p  pI consulted the a hrefhttpsgithub.comfsharpFSharp.Datasupportedplatforms relnofollowFSharp.Data GitHub pagea, but it is not clear to me why Profile 47 is needed. I use VS2013 compiling to FSharp.Core 4.3.0.0 shouldnt that be sufficient, since the GitHub page lists it as one of the supported platformsp  pI have created a new project, readded all my source files and references, and tried rebuilding. I have even tried uninstalling and then reinstalling Microsoft VS, even though I know it is a long shot. p  pI think it is most probable that the problem lies with referencing FSharp.Data.TypeProviders. The error message does not appear insofar as I exclude reference to FSharp.Data.TypeProviders. The strangest thing is that I have not changed my references at all over the past week or so, but the error message only appeared yesterday. p  pSo, my questions arep  ol liIs Profile 47 really required If so, how may I acquire itli liEven if I emdoem acquire Profile 47, wouldnt I still experience trouble building my project, since my other references do not target Profile 47li liAre there any approaches that I may not have consideredli ol

Negative 4682 pstrongBackground infostrongp  pWhen using SlickGrid instantiation can be done as follows.p  precodegrid  new Slick.Gridcontainer, data, cols codepre  pThe function codeSlick.Gridcode takes its value from the following piece of codep  precodefunction      Slick.Grid   .extendtrue, window,      Slick        Grid SlickGrid         ... codepre  pWhich leads us to the internal name of the constructor function codeSlickGridcode. This constructor has a second parameter codedatacode which is used by the SlickGrid component by calling the following function when it needs to render strongrowsstrong.p  precodefunction getDataItemi    if data.getItem      return data.getItemi    else      return data[i]     codepre  pFrom this we can conclude that codedatacode can be an object with the method codegetItemcode. During testing the behaviour of this method I have seen that it is called for every row, that is when certain rows come into view this function makes it possible to return a row in a form of a JS object keyed by column names.p  pThis feature of SlickGrid which selectively displays rows and calls the codegetDataItemcode function when doing so is very useful when we need to load data selectively from an external data source.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pFrom the a hrefhttpmleibman.github.ioSlickGridexamplesexamplespreadsheet.html relnofollowspreadsheet examplea, it is evident that the SlickGrid component is able to load columns dynamically while the user is scrolling horizontally, but while doing this the call to the method codegetDataItemcode is still returning full rows.p  pSometimes it happens that a horizonal table provides a better way of laying out data. Is there a canonical way of using SlickGrid with a horizontal table  where the codegetDataItemcode would be returning columns instead of rows  this making it possible to accommodate it to dynamically load data items per column from an external sourcep

Negative 4682 pIm writing my own c library for an Atmel ATmega2560 chip from scratch as an exercise to learn how it and electronics in general works. As part of this, I want to create a new, fundamental codebytecode type in C, that isnt just an alias of another type, and has an exact size of 8 bits. p  pAs this is an embedded platform, I want to avoid generating additional instructions for the chip to process as much as possible, which makes classes and structs a poor fit. I know that I could use the codecharcode type, but its size is vaguely defined at least one byte, and the size of a byte can vary between platforms by the C standards, and Im not sure how the AVR platform treats it though I suspect an codeunsigned charcode would be 8 bits, as the majority of the registers are 8 bits. There are also other reasons Id prefer not to use codeunsigned charcode.p  pEssentially, what I would like to do once my library is operational is something likep  precodeint main   PORTB is global object instantiated in my lib that unifies handling the Data Register and Data Direction Register for PORTB pins on the chip. PORTD is similar, just memory addresses of registers are different    PORTB.setDDR0  All pins are inputs.   PORTD.setDDR0xFF  All pins are outputs.   byte b  PORTB.read   b  0b10011000   PORTD.writeb    return 0  codepre  pBeing able to implicitly cast tofrom an int and other fundamental types would be a bonus, but probably not necessary. Is it at all possible to do this, short of forking avrgcc and writing in a new intrinsic typep  pNote I do have the full data sheet for the ATmega2560, which includes a listing of the instruction set. Im not afraid to use inline Assembly if I have to, but would prefer not to for performance after all, Im only human and bestpractices reasons.p  pI was able to find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1572420creatinganewprimitivetypethis questiona, but thats still just aliasing, and offers no control over the actual size of the type. Some of the answers also mention using a Boost lib Im not sure Boost works on AVR, and I dont want to rely on other libraries, as that defeats the purpose of writing my own from scratch.p

Negative 4682 pI have an active site thats hosted on Ubuntu, uses nginx, and the site is written in Python CherryPy is the server, Bottle is the framework.p  pI have a shell script that copies python files that I upload over the existing live site ones which then of course results in CherryPy restarting the server so its running the latest code how I want it. The problem is, in between the time its stopping and started a default static page is displayed to any unlucky person who tries to view a page on the site at that time hope they arent submitting a form. Ive seen this page a bunch of times while updating.p  pMy current setup is two copies of the site running on two ports reverse proxied with nginx. So I figured if I update one, wait a few seconds, then update the other then the site will be up 100 of the time, but this doesnt appear to be the casep  pLets say I have reverse proxy on ports 8095 and 8096, both show the same site but two identical copies of it on the hard drive. I update the python files for port 8095 which causes that port to go down while CherryPy restarts it. Shouldnt everyone then be hitting 8096 It doesnt seem to be working like this. I have an 8 second delay in my file copy script and according to CherryPy logs the 2nd stopped to restart 6 seconds after the 1st was already finished restarting, yet I saw the default static offline page thats displayed when the server is down.

Negative 4682 pIm working on a legacy project that has a folder of shared binaries that various projects use. I know it would be better to use a nuget solution rather than a folder of shared binaries, but this legacy project environment wont allow that.p  pThe problem that we have is that some other versions of these shared binaries already exist on engineers machines installed into the GAC I assume. Consequently when they add a reference they occasionally choose the system GAC instance rather than the project instance.p  pThen when we deploy to the remote targets that dont have their GAC version of the DLL installed, the applicationweb page doesnt work.p  pIve seen how references are added to the codecsprojcode XML file but I dont quite recognize how to determine if the reference will result in a GAC or not.p  pIs there a method in Visual Studio to determine if the DLL is coming from the GAC or from our shared library folder If not within Visual Studio, is there a VS command line options for this How about a way to conclusively recognize this in the code.slncode or code.csprojcode filesp

To create a scratch array in a nonrecursive method, I made the wrapper function...p  precodevoid mergesortint low, int high      int barr  new int[highlow1]      mergesortlow, high, barr  codepre  p...which in the end calls the function...p  precodevoid mergesortint low, int high, int barr      int mid      ifhigh  low lt 2          return      int interval  high  low      mid  interval2      mergesortlow, mid, barr      mergesortmid, high, barr      mergelow, high, barr  codepre  p...but I am getting the error strongmergesort function does not take 3 argumentsstrong. Well, no duh, Visual Studio. strongWhy does it not see the latter function instead of calling itselfstrong p  pI tried fixing the issue originally by throwing away clever coding conventions and just renaming the wrapper function codemergesortwrapint low, int highcode and changing the call in the main, but then I get the error strongmergesort identifier not foundstrong. I am a Java kiddie. I dont understand this at all. Many thanks to anyone who can help.p
Negative 4682 pI am using MATLABs codefitgmdistcode fit a guassian mixture to data, from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox with some success.  Is there a way to make it run in a verbose mode, e.g., tell me what iteration it is on, or show convergence stats during the process, so I know how well it is progressingp  pRelated, is there a way after the function has run and delivered the codegmdistributioncode object, to determine how many iterations actually ran or how close the convergence came  It would be useful to know these things so I could better set the options parameters up front.p
